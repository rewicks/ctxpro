He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.<eos> You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Megan-Ann.<eos> Megan-Ann. Okay. I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.<eos> Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
You renamed the family diner after yourself.<eos> That was your idea.<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?<eos> Right. Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.
So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.
Also in the garden.<eos> In the quarry.<eos> I assume it's his mother he hears, or thinks he hears.<eos> It seems to give him comfort.<eos> I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> _ NO.<eos> No, signore, I do not.
How many did you hide?<eos> I don't know the number.<eos> Lock her in.<eos> Lock her in!<eos> Do it, Rys.<eos> Do what he says. Do exactly what he says.<eos> Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I don't know the number.<eos> Lock her in.<eos> Lock her in!<eos> Do it, Rys.<eos> Do what he says. Do exactly what he says.<eos> Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> I do, Lutz.
Oh, my... What's going on with you?<eos> Man, he loves you.<eos> Butnomatterhow much helookedforfoodinthere , heneverfoundanything.<eos> Andhelooked.<eos> Alot.<eos> Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.
Man, he loves you.<eos> Butnomatterhow much helookedforfoodinthere , heneverfoundanything.<eos> Andhelooked.<eos> Alot.<eos> Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I do?
No.<eos> I pushed you away.<eos> And I was... I was really mad at the world.<eos> And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that I don't kick myself for doing that.<eos> There'sthatsweatysmell.<eos> You think, uh, it'd be crazy if... We did something together?<eos> Are you asking me out on a date?<eos> Well, I just think that I'd be an all-time fool if I just watched you drive away.<eos> Enoughtalking. Useyournose .<eos> Then don't.
Take care.<eos> I feel like we're the bad kids ditching school to go smoke.<eos> - What's wrong with that?<eos> - You were one of the bad kids.<eos> I was as a matter of fact, but that's a long time ago.<eos> Isn't this pond just beautiful?<eos> And that rock face over there, its just exquisite. Don't you think?<eos> Yes, I do. It's stunning.<eos> Do you still remember what it looks like?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I do.
I was a receptionist there before I met you.<eos> You know, I...<eos> He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.<eos> You don't have to, uh... you know, hide anything.<eos> We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?<eos> Did you ever sleep with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?
They know we're up here.<eos> How do you know they're narcotics?<eos> 'Cause I'm a cop.<eos> Easy.<eos> There something you want to tell me?<eos> Never a dull moment.<eos> But I didn't know this.<eos> I don't really know what's going on.<eos> Truly.<eos> Now, Stanley, you never do.
Stay with us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you good?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> I think you kicked the hornet's nest today.<eos> Yeah, we did that.
Stand down!<eos> Return to the ground immediately!<eos> Return to the ground, or we will open fire!<eos> - Go up, go up!<eos> - I got this.<eos> Take my trophy.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> I'm gonna die.<eos> I did it!<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Fine.<eos> You know, dreams are important.<eos> They can be a way of opening' a window, letting' the bad air out.<eos> Is there anyone you're not especially fond of?<eos> Nope.<eos> Haven't been able to find any.<eos> Guess that's just the way I am.<eos> Don't you get mad at 'em?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> But what parent doesn't?
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm looking for inspiration.<eos> Anything good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seeing how awful these are is a real pick-me-up.<eos> Ah, yeah, it's pretty gross.<eos> I actually work here.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't walk around all the time in a red smock with a name tag?<eos> No, I do not.
I'm sorry. I'm selfish.<eos> I'm the trophy wife.<eos> I'm the gold-digger and everything else that you've ever said about me behind my back.<eos> Did you ever bother to think that I'm a human being that has feelings? No, probably not.<eos> But I don't care because I don't need your pity.<eos> And I don't need your support.<eos> Stop it, honey.<eos> Stop, both of you. Just stop.<eos> I don't think you have any other move left, Stan.<eos> Of course he does.
It's not possible!<eos> How could she...? !<eos> Everything about who I was is on there.<eos> The problems of your past are your business.<eos> The problems of your future... ..are my privilege.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She destroyed it.<eos> She?<eos> You know her!<eos> You do, don't you?
Why would he want to kill me?<eos> He said you betrayed him.<eos> Oh, no, no, that's insane.<eos> Well, it's what he believes.<eos> I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.<eos> That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.<eos> Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.<eos> God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.
Oh, hello, Red.<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you. Trying to figure out my plan. I'll just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your deaths.<eos> - Because I'm going to kill you, one by one, until you tell me, where is my crystal?<eos> We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what?<eos> One of you does.
He's king around here.<eos> He's god to these people.<eos> Kong's a pretty good king.<eos> Keeps to himself mostly.<eos> This is his home.<eos> We're just guests here.<eos> But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight.<eos> Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?<eos> No.<eos> One of them did.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't. I don't.
Why fixate on Culverton Smith?<eos> He's had his obsessions before, of course, but this goes a bit further than setting a man-trap for Father Christmas.<eos> Do it. Ask him.<eos> Spending all night talking to a woman who wasn't even there.<eos> Oh, shut up, you!<eos> - Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone...<eos> - No, no, no, no, stop.<eos> I detest conversation in the past tense.<eos> You said the fact that you were his brother made no difference.<eos> It doesn't.
Oh, you'll find the real Landers on the north shore, tied up with two others.<eos> - Two others?<eos> - Hm.<eos> Well, it was trial and error.<eos> We had to find the right waistband.<eos> This is insane!<eos> This is unnecessary.<eos> No, your security is compromised and we don't know who to trust.<eos> And that justifies dressing up?<eos> Yes, it does!
!<eos> Why are you making fun of me? !<eos> Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.<eos> Softer, Sherlock.<eos> Molly, this is for a case.<eos> It's... it's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.<eos> We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this.
It's very important.<eos> I can't say why.<eos> But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that, I can't...<eos> I can't say that to you.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> 'You know why.'<eos> No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
If you want you can marry<eos> Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy<eos> They came.<eos> What is it?<eos> I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies, and told them what he did.<eos> It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.

Earth.<eos> We could go and find him.<eos> We do not have to tell him who I am.<eos> I could just see him.<eos> Maybe I can ask for the time.<eos> No one has to know.<eos> - Do you know where he lives?<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
Let me tell you something, J-bird.<eos> - Batman doesn't do 'ships.<eos> - What?<eos> As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.<eos> I don't need anyone.<eos> You mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.
Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Joker, you mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.
K'un-Lun.<eos> Which is... where?<eos> uh... can't really get there from here.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Now it's time to go.<eos> if you...<eos> - You really need to leave.<eos> This is just a practice sword. It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.
We'll make this right.<eos> What an idiot!<eos> Does he have any idea what he just did?<eos> I'm sure he has no idea that he was speaking for the entire company.<eos> What do you wanna do about it?<eos> Well... We weren't gonna settle before, and we're not gonna settle now.<eos> Especially when they're asking double the original number.<eos> That's blackmail.<eos> They didn't have a leg to stand on before.<eos> Now they do.
He wasn't willing to make a deal.<eos> is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
- Surprised to see me, I know.<eos> What are you...<eos> How?<eos> Oh, it's really too much to go into.<eos> Right now, it hardly matters.<eos> Um, we need a moment.<eos> Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?<eos> You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
I'll drop by later.<eos> noodle place you like on 6th Street.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> you're my daughter.<eos> That place opened up last year.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> I think you need a little rest.<eos> Why did you frame Danny?<eos> I didn't.
- Okay?<eos> I'm looking into this company, but they've been transferring assets from one corporation to the next.<eos> Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.
Where do you think you're going?<eos> You're gonna need another lawyer.<eos> - Why did you follow me into the building?<eos> - Ms. Jones, lose my card.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't. Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thanks.<eos> Are we no longer on speaking terms?<eos> As long as we're in this organization, as long as we are alive, we will be on the same side.<eos> Do you remember what it looks like?<eos> The only way we return to it is if we secure the Iron Fist.<eos> Oh, that is why I am here.<eos> But the first person you sought out was Colleen Wing.<eos> Hmm, yes, that was our assignment.<eos> She could lead us to the Iron Fist.<eos> - And she did.
Shit!<eos> Do you recognize that language?<eos> That's why you dragged me down here?<eos> To be a translator?<eos> What does it say?<eos> I've seen this language before, but there's a lot I didn't learn.<eos> A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it...<eos> I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.
Not an indecent proposal like in the movie... because I think to pay a million bucks to get laid... that's out of the question.<eos> I'm gonna offer you $5,000.<eos> - What are you doing, Frank?<eos> - Look,<eos> I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang, you take the money, you go up, you get on a plane, you fly to wherever the hell it is in the sticks, and, uh, you know, $5,000 goes a long way up there.<eos> If you need more money, call me up, come back, we bang again.<eos> Price goes down 'cause I already had you.<eos> But if you want to bring a girlfriend... price goes back up.<eos> - Well, I don't know what to say here.<eos> - I do.
Didn't work.<eos> If she were born in...<eos> What country treasures their women?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - What am I talking about?<eos> Mom, can I have a slushy?<eos> Yes, in just a minute.<eos> Is that Abby's brother?<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, no, I just...<eos> you know, I didn't really see it.<eos> You pointed it out to me!<eos> And then you stepped directly in it.<eos> - Since when do you read?<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Books are stupid.<eos> I don't.
Correct.<eos> But I deserve it, and here's why.<eos> There we were, right?<eos> We were just walking down the street, minding our own business.<eos> I'd just spotted the perfect pile of dog shit, and naturally I stepped in it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, I'm a little confused.<eos> Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces?<eos> - Well, I didn't, really...
- You said naturally you did...<eos> - And we all watched you do it.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit so that I would smell of dog shit.<eos> Happy?<eos> - Less happy.<eos> - Why would it make me happy?<eos> I was trying to cover up the smell of the skunk that I let spray me so that there would be no questions.<eos> - Well, now I have more questions.<eos> - Of course you do.
He's just always cranky and irritated.<eos> - Rage-filled, rape-y.<eos> - It's like, as the years go by, he just gets more and more irrational.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Especially with this whole "work the bar" angle.<eos> - I mean, what is that? - (scoffs)<eos> Unless...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.<eos> - He doesn't?
I can't do this if you won't talk to me.<eos> What do you wanna know?<eos> Everything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yeah. We'll manage.<eos> My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict. Crack.<eos> You can fill in the blanks.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> I did.
Still with a allergies?<eos> Why have you got a cat? You don't even like cats.<eos> Not my cat, it's Mary's cat.<eos> I'm just along for a ride.<eos> So let me guess, our lovely principal, Miss Davis.<eos> Never get on the bad side of small minded people who have a little authority.<eos> I thought I taught you that.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> You don't think I have a right to see my granddaughter?<eos> I do.
So what were you fighting about?<eos> I mistook his glass for mine.<eos> That happens.<eos> This man is no fighter.<eos> Charlie is an expert marksman.<eos> Means he shoots people.<eos> From very far away.<eos> You never know what hit 'em.<eos> So, how do you know who you kill if you can't see their face?<eos> I don't.
That's why we're here.<eos> The gas will kill everything.<eos> What kind weapons kills innocents?<eos> In this war... Every kind.<eos> You were absent at the counsel meeting, General.<eos> I see you are negotiating the terms of the armistice without me.<eos> - On the Kaiser's behalf.<eos> - I'm on your insistence.<eos> We could easily win this war if only you had a little faith.<eos> We don't.
Buried forever, Vincent.<eos> Crushed and lost forever.<eos> That's right.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Do it.<eos> Hey. Vince. You're back.<eos> Okay, Hildur... finally.<eos> Oslo's decision is that I have to sign off on all subsidy payments.<eos> Erling, you and I came to an agreement...<eos> No, no, no, no, we didn't.
She needs this.<eos> _<eos> Goodnight, Natalie.<eos> If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not.<eos> I don't want to live without you.<eos> Are you planning to keep the beard?<eos> You don't like the beard?<eos> I don't like the rash.<eos> I don't have a rash.<eos> I do.
Siempre.<eos> - Siempre.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> You're talented.<eos> Listen, listen, fuck the church, okay?<eos> Fuck the record company, fuck Roy, your parents, me, fuck Cool Calvin, fuck everybody, do it for you.<eos> - It's your night. It belongs to you.<eos> - Okay. - Come on, come on, you're on.<eos> - You do it for you.
They need to set you free.<eos> And they need to trust you'll still be there for them.<eos> Responsibility doesn't just lie with them.<eos> You have to set yourself free.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shane.<eos> Do you smoke pot?<eos> I mean, sometimes.<eos> Do you have any?<eos> Yeah. I do.
It's not real.<eos> It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.<eos> To ensure continuation of species.<eos> When early men went visit a watering hole... If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.<eos> Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.<eos> So it will never happen again.<eos> This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...<eos> It's a biological lie.<eos> You don't have to accept it.<eos> I don't!
Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.<eos> Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.<eos> Find me the fastest route out of that bay.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Why are they shooting at me?<eos> I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.<eos> Shut up Tej.<eos> Dom.<eos> Do you really wanna put that car in gear?<eos> Do you?
The question is, what you gonna do when you're out here slumming it with the rest of us?<eos> Cause the safety of these numbers comes with a price.<eos> There are no free rides here.<eos> Everyone puts in work, whether cliqued up or not.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...
Where's your propriety, Brace?<eos> Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> No, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers. And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg? I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> You needed a brother.<eos> Still do.
It is a place where, someday, I hope we will meet and be happy.<eos> In those days, I always chose boys who had the shadow of death on them.<eos> I thought they would be less likely to return.<eos> Of course, they do return... as ghosts.<eos> Now I'm older... How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see... You didn't die, did you?<eos> Not even over there, where everyone dies.<eos> No. No, I did not.
You present yourself as an agent of the free states of America, like a good little sheep.<eos> But long since, you've been dangled in front of the King of England by the East India Company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate.<eos> Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.<eos> Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No-one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.
I do not have a girl of that name.<eos> No?<eos> A mulatto?<eos> I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
Oh, you're gonna like that.<eos> I'm in your corner, champ.<eos> Knock 'em dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Red door.<eos> What is with you, bradley?<eos> Be happy.<eos> We're about to rid ourselves of an asshole Who has majorly, majorly fucked us over.<eos> Well, he nailed ike the spike for us.<eos> He didn't do that for us.
What happened to us back there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something.<eos> But I don't remember a thing.<eos> Same with me.<eos> I hope these pajamas are okay.<eos> They've been in my locker since the time that dog got lost in here.<eos> They're beautiful, Lucy.<eos> Do you remember that night, Andy?<eos> Yes, I do.
Two.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You and Caleb are sitting so far apart that you could be in different time zones.<eos> Mona's living with us.<eos> I'm her sponsor.<eos> - What?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - She doesn't have anyone else.<eos> I'm not trying to take Caleb's side here, but...<eos> Then don't.
Mary Drake's already in custody.<eos> We caught her a few blocks from here.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Well, no one can call you loser Mona anymore.<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> This relationship stands for love, loyalty and trust but above all, for friendship.<eos> Aria, your vows.<eos> I, Aria, take thee, Ezra to have and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse for richer, for poorer to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> I don't need tissues.<eos> Em, today you do.
- Good job.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Let's lose Fox News.<eos> Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.<eos> - Already written it.<eos> - When?<eos> It's already written.<eos> Did it last night.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did. - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
A nice-looking set of graphs.<eos> Or a nicer-looking set of graphs than the last set of graphs.<eos> Either that or get yourself fired.<eos> Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or however it is this thing ends.<eos> There's no street parade at the end of this one.<eos> It's good to talk.<eos> Everybody. How are you?<eos> Morning.<eos> Yeah, it's good to see you again.<eos> - How you doing?
I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry... Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.<eos> Well, who asked you to take care of me?<eos> What do you think you're trying to protect me from?<eos> No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?<eos> No, I don't, Mother.
No, I don't, Mother.<eos> Let's just drop this.<eos> A little late for that.<eos> Look in here.<eos> I don't want to look in there.<eos> Mother, never mind, okay?<eos> Do you remember the night you were putting up the shower curtains?<eos> No.<eos> Do you remember a man showing up?<eos> No, Mother, no, I don't.
Hi bro. Did you make a move?<eos> I sort of made a move.<eos> Can you talk?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off. Tell me you closed her. Tell me you closed her during silent auction.<eos> She didn't even see me.<eos> I'm not sure about this one.<eos> She's impossible to get to.<eos> I have no in.<eos> Or maybe I do.
You betrayed me.<eos> It was just business.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> You knew how much I needed this.<eos> You knew how desperate I was.<eos> You think I'll spend the rest of my life living with my sister and nephew in their crappy little apartment?<eos> I thought you said you liked living with us.<eos> Hugo, no...<eos> No, I mean... yes.<eos> I do. I do very much.
Liam, I'll consider asking Theo for help when I don't have a station full of armed deputies to back me up.<eos> Any available units, this is Sheriff Stilinski.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> I repeat, any and all units, this is Sheriff Stilinski.<eos> Respond immediately with your 20.<eos> - All units...<eos> - They're gone.<eos> That, that... That's not possible.<eos> That's... They couldn't have taken everyone.<eos> THEO: They didn't.
Uh, just... Try and slow your breathing.<eos> I can't...<eos> Shh. Shh. Stiles, look at me.<eos> Shh.<eos> Look at me. Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.<eos> I did?
I can't...<eos> Shh. Shh. Stiles, look at me.<eos> Shh.<eos> Look at me. Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.<eos> I did?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Where's the briefcase now?<eos> Mangels' former Beverly Hills estate, which Galinda intends to keep.<eos> There are wireless alarm sensors outfitted to every point of entry.<eos> - There are also cameras...<eos> - Loads of them.<eos> According to Mangels, just off the living room is a hidden custom-made U.L. class 350 safe where our prize awaits.<eos> With all that security, we can't risk breaking in.<eos> We'll need a cover.<eos> We do have a cover.<eos> Well... you do.
I'm trying to make a living now that my sister has stolen the family business out from under me.<eos> Well, you'll be glad to hear someone's trying to steal it from under me.<eos> Wow, that didn't take long.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> Does it look like I am masterminding the takedown of the Kensington Firm?<eos> Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No, I do.
Benji, I thought you'd never ask.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> The only reason the fbi recruited us...<eos> Recruited you.<eos> Is because we are the very best at what we do,<eos> And we didn't get to be that way. By taking orders from other people.<eos> Well, margot...<eos> We don't need margot.<eos> If justine wants us to take down this smuggling ring...<eos> Which she emphatically does not.
And the optican group is a front for the southland drug cartel.<eos> What?<eos> My god.<eos> So, the kincaids were selling drugs for the southland cartel?<eos> And hiding the money in an account with tommy's name on it?<eos> If whoever killed the kincaids was after that money...<eos> They're gonna come after tommy next.<eos> I'm calling him right now.<eos> Does alice know you're here?<eos> No. She doesn't.
Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?<eos> I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that? - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?
Yes.<eos> K. Chapman.<eos> Karen Chapman.<eos> Yes, but K could be for anything.<eos> It could be for Katherine or Kordelia.<eos> Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.<eos> Well, don't you want to see him, too?<eos> Don't you want to find out who you really are?<eos> - Of course I do.
A bullet is the fastest way to stop a beating heart.<eos> Where's Randall?<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Father.<eos> I-I heard him barking in my dreams, but when I woke, he...<eos> The dog is dead.<eos> Father, he died when I was a child.<eos> No, no, I heard him!<eos> He's here. I heard him.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course you did.
So let me give you a lesson in how to negotiate properly.<eos> You make yourself presentable for your soldiers.<eos> And choose a new mask.<eos> It might be your last.<eos> Jane, you have to help!<eos> What happened?<eos> The Wizard and his men have Langwidere.<eos> The Wizard is here?<eos> If her soldiers don't turn over the guns, he's going to execute her.<eos> What do we do?
Witches!<eos> Still here, are you?<eos> There doesn't have to be a war.<eos> Is that why the wizard animated the stone giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong roan was about you.<eos> He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
You weren't the one who has lived with them and drank with them and bled with them.<eos> So in the absence of Long John Silver, the men will look to me, not you, for answers to what happens next, and I will be the one to give them those answers, not you.<eos> I have become so easily set aside, have I?<eos> Do you have value to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would your skill in a fight aid us in our efforts?<eos> Of course.<eos> But do we need you here?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
Good job.<eos> You stayin' out here, bro?<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> - That's gotta be them.<eos> - What?<eos> That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
Fuck.<eos> Pull a fucking gun on me?<eos> - I didn't know it was you!<eos> - You're not gonna answer your phone?<eos> You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA to talk to you?<eos> My phone was broken.<eos> I was trying to activate it--<eos> I told you to stay away from that drug house.<eos> You gotta stop shooting Allen!<eos> I didn't do it on purpose!
Dad... Do you work for the Gestapo?<eos> No.<eos> I'm a detective with the Metropolitan Police.<eos> The Gestapo are at Scotland Yard.<eos> They're in the building next door.<eos> And they're mostly all Germans.<eos> But you work with the Gestapo?<eos> Is that what you've heard?<eos> The boys at school said so.<eos> I don't.
12 of them.<eos> Did he fight back?<eos> Even Harry realised 12 was too many.<eos> Sit yourself down.<eos> Who made the arrest?<eos> Some young PC from Hounslow division.<eos> Never heard of Harry Woods, he said.<eos> Doubt if he'd heard of Scotland Yard either.<eos> Why didn't he show them his warrant card?<eos> Well, he did.
The King was never meant to escape.<eos> He was infirm.<eos> He would have cut a pathetic figure in Washington or anywhere else.<eos> Britain would have looked washed up.<eos> Instead he dies a hero, in the same operation as brave Americans.<eos> I bet in the next few days, the Queen and the Princesses will be on a ship from New Zealand for Washington to represent us.<eos> That's the way Mayhew works.<eos> The long game.<eos> Well then, with men like that, how did you ever lose the war?<eos> Perhaps we didn't. Just the battle.

That's where they buried her.<eos> I traced it to a town called Sacrament Valley, about four hours from here.<eos> That's where we need to go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Thank you, Jamal.<eos> The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!<eos> The police want to ask me questions, Holt.<eos> - They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.
Hello?<eos> Thank you, Jamal.<eos> The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!<eos> The police want to ask me questions, Holt.<eos> - They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.<eos> I hope if you learn anything from an education, it's that more than one theory can be true.<eos> I didn't kill Skye.<eos> And I did.
I want Robbie to watch while I take this gorgeous man's cock in my mouth.<eos> Pissing on him wasn't enough.<eos> I want you to come in my mouth,<eos> I'm going to spit it on his grave.<eos> Jesus, who knew I could be so angry?<eos> No, no, no, no. Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> You're right.<eos> Fuck me already. Don't, Audrey.<eos> Audrey, don't.
Her job was to be an emotional anchor for the incarnations of Gabriel.<eos> There are others?<eos> We call them shadows.<eos> But, yes, they are clones.<eos> 13 shadows, 13 elimination targets.<eos> But not yet perfected, which is why you had to create a false life in between missions.<eos> Keep the shadows from going mad, right?<eos> We had to reanimate immediately on the death of the previous.<eos> I had no idea that the memory threads would jump from clone to clone like twins.<eos> Really, I didn't.
When you jab, you leave that front leg wide open.<eos> No, I'm angled away.<eos> It's safe.<eos> Not if he steps over the left foot.<eos> Right?<eos> Hey, Alvey. Alvey: How you doing?<eos> I got a class.<eos> Catch you guys later.<eos> Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?<eos> Yeah, she did.
It's very hot.<eos> But you... you... You have to watch that.<eos> Everything they say will sound like a royal decree.<eos> It makes you feel too stupid to talk.<eos> He's not like that.<eos> He's from Manchester.<eos> It's kind of, like, a rough area.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I don't want you to feel inferior.<eos> I don't.
No, no, I'm good.<eos> The good shit up top?<eos> Come on.<eos> Before you go, before you go...<eos> You want to play a game of chance?<eos> What's the game?<eos> What's the game?<eos> You sure you want to know my game?<eos> Oh, you don't even have one.<eos> No, I do.
A few people told me.<eos> They... they love you.<eos> It wasn't gossip.<eos> Can we have two more shots?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Drink?<eos> Ah, I don't drink.<eos> They told you everything?<eos> They did, indeed.
You can even help out at my clinic.<eos> Oh, I would love that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We promise.<eos> - Goodbye. - Bye-bye.<eos> - (speaking Mandarin)<eos> You said that we have to get back home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But do we?
But for some reason, boy, it just splashed over into something that Judith Crist dubbed "porn chic."<eos> If you touch me, I can get off.<eos> We'll get off tog ether.<eos> If you just... just put your cock in me.<eos> Would you like to put your cock in me?<eos> Then we can get off.<eos> People were going as couples to see hardcore pornographic films, to see sex films.<eos> I mean, nice couples.<eos> At the time, I had no idea that anyone I knew, much less anyone that I was related to would ever see this film.<eos> And, um, they did.
As is the silence.<eos> See, I can guarantee... that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know... who are the others?<eos> Who else is responsible for my death?<eos> Well, you're going to learn soon enough.<eos> And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.<eos> It they haven't already.<eos> What?<eos> Feeling paranoid?<eos> On edge?<eos> High school does that to a person.
What follows "listen" is nothing good.<eos> Let me put it this way. Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."<eos> I always kind of liked Marcus.<eos> Marcus, I will definitely think about it.<eos> You always seemed like a good guy.<eos> Don't think too hard.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.<eos> Then again, they almost always do.
So, this site says that one of John Grady Cole's central flaws is... his tendency to see the world in black and white, good and evil...<eos> Sheri.<eos> Do you remember Dollar Valentines last year?<eos> What?<eos> Dollar Valen...<eos> I mean, yeah, I guess I remember.<eos> Why?<eos> Hannah matched with Marcus.<eos> Did she?<eos> Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.
And he just got away with everything.<eos> And he scored, like, 30 points tonight.<eos> You keyed his car 'cause he scored 30 points?<eos> No, because it's not fair, Tony.<eos> It's not fucking fair.<eos> Those tapes are messing me up.<eos> - They're doing shit to my head.<eos> - I get it. I get it.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do.
That's a long time.<eos> Could have come over any time.<eos> Your dad hates me.<eos> He does not.<eos> He does. Last summer he told me I was trouble, and that I'd better toe the line.<eos> That's just a thing he says to guys.<eos> You got it way easier than Alex.<eos> With the hair.<eos> So, he didn't like Alex either.<eos> Well, he kind of did.
You know, I think you can be both.<eos> I mean, like... right now, maybe it's easier being mad at him than being sad.<eos> That's cool. But...<eos> I also think that maybe someday you might feel worse if all you were today was mad, you know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes you judge people...<eos> I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.

Do you want to talk in there?<eos> Stop.<eos> - I've got to stop.<eos> - You want me to stop the car? No.<eos> Yes!<eos> No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.<eos> You should just go.<eos> I thought it was okay. I don't want you here.<eos> Get out.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay. I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay? Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.
You should just go.<eos> I thought it was okay. I don't want you here.<eos> Get out.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay. I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay? Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
- I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?<eos> Not really.<eos> I-I think...<eos> I think...<eos> I might have been... I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
- I didn't say that. You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.<eos> That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.<eos> When did you talk to her last?<eos> She told you how she got to that point.<eos> Did you have an encounter at the party?<eos> An encounter?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.
But let's just say he had some help.<eos> And the true power here is a little more complicated than that.<eos> And two, there is, by law... and strict enforcement of the administration, no piracy in Nassau.<eos> Not anymore. Not ever.<eos> It's critical for commerce.<eos> This is known to the world.<eos> Meet me at the jetty.<eos> Are we ready to depart?<eos> Don't remember talking about bringing on new people.<eos> We didn't.
Having fun at this time of night?<eos> Come on. It's bed.<eos> Come on. Let's go on up.<eos> I'll take her.<eos> Come on. Good night.<eos> Say night night. Love you. Love you.<eos> Right, Monkey. I'll race you.<eos> Come on. Go, go, go!<eos> What if something goes wrong?<eos> But what if it doesn't?
I was Negan before I even met you. I just needed to meet you properly to know.<eos> I'm Negan.<eos> Eugene: Hey, be careful with that.<eos> [Walkers growling] Hey, you want to get burned by molten metal?<eos> 'Cause that's exactly how you get burned by molten metal.<eos> Regarding me clamping down...<eos> You on board?<eos> I am.<eos> Don't know if you recall my handle...<eos> I don't.
They can't.<eos> The need more guns, more people, more time, more excuses.<eos> I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick about the inside of Negan's place.<eos> Jesus made me a map of the outside.<eos> It's far away. It's well-defended.<eos> There's only two of us.<eos> You changing your mind?<eos> I'm ready to kill him.<eos> But I need to make sure you know what this means.<eos> Do you?
You have... to... kill.<eos> Or else you might as well just kill yourself.<eos> Someone had to die.<eos> I tried to be the one. That didn't happen.<eos> So I'll be the one to lead our army to crush the Saviors... destroy them.<eos> Me.<eos> I'll talk to Ezekiel.<eos> I'll tell everyone what I did. And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> Did you?
Do you want to know what happened in Alexandria?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Negan killed Glenn and Abraham.<eos> What?<eos> and Rick and everybody else... everything they do is for the Saviors now.<eos> And they killed more.<eos> Olivia...<eos> Jesus brought Rick and the rest here because...<eos> You wanted to know.<eos> Now you do.
You're moving up in the world. Negan wants you where he is.<eos> You're an important fellow, Harlan.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> I have patients here that need me.<eos> Why does negan need two doctors?<eos> Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.<eos> People say I have an expressive face.<eos> But if not, let me repeat your question.<eos> Why do we need two doctors?<eos> Answer... we don't.
I'm sick of the quiet.<eos> Good God.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Stop looking at that fucking website, man.<eos> What these people are doing to me is a war crime.<eos> They give out our exact address.<eos> It just sucks 'cause people hate sex offenders, and now they have my location.<eos> It's like I'm a fish in a barrel.<eos> Hey, I promise you, nobody looks at this shit, okay?<eos> Vigilantes do.
Thanks so much, Kenny.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> So, II got to ask you... is Jay Kulina changing diapers now?<eos> Because I find that kind of hard to imagine.<eos> I do it all.<eos> I'm a fullservice dad.<eos> I got bottles and diapers.<eos> I'm singing and slinging lullabies in multiple octaves.<eos> - You want to sing one right now?<eos> - No, sir, I do not.
Where you from?<eos> You sound... You sound familiar.<eos> The Bronx.<eos> - Puerto Rican. - Wow.<eos> You don't get many Puerto Ricans in the Bronx, now, do you?<eos> South Bronx, not Puerto Rican.<eos> Yeah. No, no, I know where you're from.<eos> King Kulina casts a long shadow, brother.<eos> Well, I don't know about that.<eos> You do. You do.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Don't... Don't... No, no, no, don't open it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because this is a thousanddollar stroller.<eos> We can't afford that.<eos> We didn't buy it.<eos> This is a gift.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, please.<eos> Don't.
Amy was just a girl at the bar.<eos> They're out there.<eos> Not like her, man.<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> She wasn't when I met her.<eos> I had her pregnant five hours after she said hello.<eos> Which is remarkable because "I never do this sort of thing."<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't either.
Made fun of. Humiliated.<eos> Left out.<eos> Just lonely as shit.<eos> 'Cause if he was, I mean, he fucking nailed it.<eos> He had no one.<eos> It's hard for me to understand why God would put someone on this Earth just to suffer.<eos> We can't understand.<eos> Um, but it's okay.<eos> It's okay to question God.<eos> I do.
And... and he caught mine.<eos> I thought I was in trouble, and I was able to get that elbow out there and... and finish him.<eos> Well, you came out pretty wild in the first round.<eos> What did your father say to you in the corner?<eos> He, um, told me to calm the fuck Dow...<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Which I needed to do.<eos> You know, Nauta's a great fighter.<eos> Respect to him and his team, but... but we got it done today.<eos> All right, well, you did.
! - Well deserved.<eos> It's a $5,000 cash bonus.<eos> So congratulations to you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, your winner...<eos> Nate Kulina!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come here.<eos> I don't know what the hell he was doing out there.<eos> He was out of control.<eos> 5 grand doesn't suck.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You just... you make nervous, man.<eos> I don't know what you're gonna say.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just, it was fine.<eos> You know, did what it's supposed to do.<eos> You got some slomo shots of you and Nate hugging?<eos> Laughing at some hilarious situation from our childhood?<eos> - In fact, we do.
You mean dictionaries?<eos> I think I was a child before the boom-booms.<eos> I think I looked like this.<eos> Want to piss on him?<eos> Get out of my head.<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> A new champ!<eos> Okay, no more!<eos> And he wants more!<eos> No, I don't!
Morty.<eos> Why would you want this to happen?<eos> All you had to do was go away!<eos> Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody!<eos> And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Morty, that was amazing!<eos> This is my brother!<eos> Not that family means anything!<eos> This family does.
I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log.<eos> I didn't know that's how we measured success.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> When did you become a monster?<eos> I was a monster when you met me!<eos> We were monsters!<eos> - We didn't care about anything!<eos> - I still don't!
In w... In w-w-what?<eos> Like, w-w-what's my point?<eos> In a way that has no point, you just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations and then you pass out.<eos> So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic...<eos> Which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.<eos> I have not stake in this...<eos> I don't either, I'm...<eos> I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel he wants what's best for it and...<eos> Hey, man, I'm not touching this.<eos> You do you.
So this is a typical predator behaviour.<eos> This isn't it happening again, this isn't what your so frightened of.<eos> I know what you think.<eos> This isn't it!<eos> What?<eos> Tell me what you think it is I think.<eos> Wasps.<eos> I know all about wasps.<eos> And you know they're all gone.<eos> - Do I?
What the fuck do you need a boat for?<eos> I like the sea air.<eos> Hildy, you hate the sea air.<eos> So obviously you have some good reason to lie to my face.<eos> I'll pay you, of course.<eos> No, thank you, Governor.<eos> I don't need your charity.<eos> I'm not the Governor any more.<eos> They fired me.<eos> They didn't.
Well, okay, how do I unblock it?<eos> We gotta find some sort of psychic Drano, or...<eos> You know what it is, don't you? The blockage?<eos> It's your stupid brother.<eos> The history between you two and how it made you go crazy, and hire a doofus to break into his house.<eos> Hey, hon, I didn't hire him, I was blackmailing him.<eos> My point is, this is a blood feud.<eos> We can't be fightin' a blood feud while we're trying to land a big-time sponsor.<eos> We're just gonna have to do it ourselves.<eos> - Do?
Even made a comparison to the prez.<eos> He must know I got a big ego.<eos> Was he at your mom's funeral?<eos> You know, when you made her that promise about what type of man you would be?<eos> Knowing each other doesn't make this a done deal.<eos> I'm still considering my options.<eos> You want me to dance?<eos> I want the cover.<eos> You don't want the cover.<eos> Hell, yeah, I do.
But we have just one instant, a single flash of such uncertain glory.<eos> I came to get you.<eos> I can't.<eos> I've nothing left.<eos> You'd hate me for what I can't give you, like I hate Lluís now.<eos> - Don't talk about Lluís.<eos> - I can't. He humiliated me.<eos> He stopped respecting me, but I can't stop loving him.<eos> Lluís might be weak, but he'll always take care of you and Ramonet.<eos> So what do I do now?
And you said...<eos> I want to be an eagle.<eos> You got to be what you say you're going to be, which you aren't.<eos> You got to do what you say you're going to do, which you haven't.<eos> Spike, come on, man.<eos> You know the terms of your parole strictly prohibit use of illegal substances. I...<eos> I got a prescription for that.<eos> Good for you, sweetie.<eos> But guess what.<eos> Mr. Putnam doesn't.
How many targets can it track simultaneously?<eos> 300, with the ability to engage 36 of them at any one time.<eos> I'm... I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
We like having Franny along, don't we?<eos> - Yeah. - There's a man in our basement.<eos> Yeah, I heard. Mwah!<eos> Be good.<eos> I'll take them all next week, I promise.<eos> Quinn, are you there?<eos> We need to get back to being independent. Quinn, you obviously hear me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Look, you can do what you want.<eos> Do nothing, whatever.
Let a jury decide how certain they are he's not gonna pick up an AR-15 and shoot them all in their sleep?<eos> Look, if you want to believe the kid's a saint, go ahead.<eos> You go anywhere near Saad Mahsud, I will have you arrested.<eos> It was nice talking to you.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Yep.<eos> National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
But I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Cross my heart.<eos> Hey. Thought that might be you.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Sleeping.<eos> Look, he had a seizure today... at the bodega a couple of blocks from here.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Because the paramedics came, and there was nothing you could do about it.<eos> And honestly, he didn't want you to know.<eos> He still doesn't.
Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.<eos> I said I expected it.<eos> - Is this about the bomb?<eos> - No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
You were confused.<eos> I-I understand.<eos> But it's coming down on both of us. We need to figure out what's going on.<eos> How did you get in here, anyway?<eos> They told me nobody gets in here... nobody.<eos> Who? Who said that?<eos> Why?<eos> "Why" what?<eos> Why did you show them the... pictures?<eos> I didn't.
I'll never understand...<eos> Fuck, it's cold out here!<eos> I believe they had a name for her in Kabul, didn't they, when she was Station Chief there.<eos> What was it again?<eos> "The Angel of Death"?<eos> "The Drone Queen."<eos> Yeah. And in Berlin?<eos> Just stop, Dar.<eos> I assume you never heard the whole story... of your medical ordeal there.<eos> Yeah, I did.
If you won't say what's bothering you, how am I supposed to help?<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> The guy you sent.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.<eos> You know that.<eos> I don't.
Am I that scary? Me?<eos> Elizabeth Keane?<eos> Gold Star mom? You are.<eos> You're a bad dream.<eos> A President of the United States who can't be controlled from within.<eos> What if I told you... I'm not ready for this, any of it?<eos> I'd say, "Good."<eos> You'd be crazy to feel ready.<eos> What if the American people made a mistake?<eos> They didn't.
He killed Astrid.<eos> What?<eos> She came all the way from Berlin to take care of me, and...<eos> And what?<eos> I'm so f-fucked up... up here,<eos> I thought she came to hurt me.<eos> I took the bullets out of her gun, and she couldn't defend herself when he came.<eos> I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.
I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't. - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
Power came to my place of work, surrounded by goose-stepping men in long coats.<eos> And I'll be honest--<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, you will have no place."<eos> For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.
Why the fuck would I volunteer to be cut open?<eos> I don't know. Why would you?<eos> - I wouldn't!<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> Knowing full well what is inside of you, you kept moving forward towards this very room and the one person powerful enough to take it out.<eos> I think you should tell him about the book you wrote.<eos> What book?<eos> The romance novel.<eos> That's him. He... he wrote it. That's him.<eos> - What? No. N-no, I didn't.
It's great that your newlyweds believe that a bird with a range of 50 miles is gonna carry their stupid poetry to Timbuktu, but don't sell that bullshit to me.<eos> I'm not trying to sell you anything.<eos> It's just a nicer story.<eos> Who was that man?<eos> What man?<eos> The man I just saw leaving.<eos> You mean Father Brian.<eos> He's the only man permitted in the convent.<eos> Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?<eos> - No. - Well, this man did.
I almost got killed today.<eos> Right? Royo tried to play me.<eos> And he got help from Aisha and Jerome.<eos> More of y'all got to be involved.<eos> Here's how we gonna do this.<eos> Bring Kevin in.<eos> Jerome tried to sell me out.<eos> And you're his little brother.<eos> So don't tell me you know nothing 'bout it.<eos> - I-I don't.
I went back to the house to change clothes, and I found this... in the mess.<eos> The way this reads, you've been talking to Rebecca for months about joining CTU.<eos> To be honest, it was just something I was considering.<eos> I'm not even not even sure I wanted it.<eos> Eric, this morning, when you asked me why I started taking birth control, and I said I thought you still needed more time, do you remember what you said to me?<eos> But that was a lie, wasn't it?<eos> Baby, you're not happy. Nicole.<eos> You need this.<eos> You always will. No, listen, even if that was true it doesn't mean I, I don't need you, baby, because I do.<eos> I do.
We're at the Pentagon.<eos> We're done working up your credentials.<eos> Well, mostly.<eos> Andy, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Mariana's on it.<eos> She's been looped in.<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?

Sunny!<eos> We're leaving for rehearsals.<eos> But the baby said there was chocolate pudding! Shh.<eos> You children are to clean the table, and wash the dishes, and polish the silver, and rinse out all the wine bottles for recycling.<eos> And then you are to go straight to your beds.<eos> You mean our bed?<eos> You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money.<eos> Of course you do.
I mean it.<eos> Hey, did you see this?<eos> Charlie gave it to me.<eos> He was saying how Shane would visit a couple times a week.<eos> You raised a good kid.<eos> I'm surprised he found the time.<eos> You didn't know he visited pops?<eos> Sure, I knew.<eos> I just didn't think he visited that often.<eos> Hey. Neither did you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> I did not want this.<eos> Flint is my friend, but I know what he is.<eos> I have no illusions about it.<eos> But for all the dangers he presents, for all his offenses... the one thing he's never done is force me to choose between him and you.<eos> That, you did.
Eleanor is dead, Anne is nearly dead, and the governor is sitting in Nassau in my fucking chair victorious!<eos> You cannot fight civilization from the outside in.<eos> And your plan now is to follow that man into more of the same?<eos> ! "What result?"<eos> That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do?
Thank you.<eos> The 1985 Ms. Pac-Man champ, huh?<eos> That must make you at least...<eos> Stop it.<eos> You're not getting it, Vasquez.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Your age has never mattered to me.<eos> I like you.<eos> And you like me.<eos> I do.
And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
- Why?<eos> - Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
You showed up early to take a look around, didn't you?<eos> See what really caused this.<eos> Unless you believe that whole<eos> "fire extinguisher malfunction flood" bullshit.<eos> - You won't stop with this.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - That was no heart attack.<eos> - Who had a heart attack?<eos> - Clemenza.<eos> Only he didn't.
Not for me.<eos> You can perform?<eos> Fucking right I can.<eos> Come back to my office and try me.<eos> - Never had any complaints.<eos> - Nice.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration.<eos> We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
Not so easy to ignore.<eos> Not possible to.<eos> The stories won't be about you anymore.<eos> They'll be about him.<eos> And the world of shit that he is in.<eos> You know what you have to do?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> This guy doesn't really come out here a few times a week.<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
Nothing.<eos> I don't know what the fuck's going on.<eos> They're all out there plotting your deaths.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Competitive table setting?<eos> Tablescape. It's called tablescape.<eos> - Oh, hello. We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
Sir.<eos> Anna, get him.<eos> Anna!<eos> You're next.<eos> - What now?<eos> You've made this move already.<eos> - I have a plan B for you.<eos> Your brother asked me the same that day.<eos> I didn't have any, then.<eos> But I do, today.
Me neither, I'm afraid.<eos> Has there been any word on Jane Walker's whereabouts?<eos> John was calling from a burner phone, which makes it harder to trace.<eos> I have no idea what that means.<eos> It means it will take more time to find his location.<eos> Right.<eos> And where is Central Park?<eos> We still have some time.<eos> Let me get Ms. Anders for you.<eos> Hey, Carl, how you doing?
How can poor Nurse Gilbert make a lovely vase if she can't concentrate because of all the noise?<eos> Then you need to smooth it -- oh, dear -- into a cone shape.<eos> Erm, and the next step is to make an opening...<eos> Mickey, it's getting too dark for this part of the pirate game.<eos> I need you to go and fetch something for me.<eos> All right, Mummy.<eos> I have noticed a certain halting of progress since I assumed the role of your spiritual directress, but the prospect of life vows can be a difficult time for a novice, and you are assured of all our prayers.<eos> I don't always doubt them.<eos> There are times when I feel them upholding me like wings.<eos> And times when you do not?
And if you wouldn't mind getting off my bed... .. I'd quite like a lie-down.<eos> Doctor, if I wasn't aware of Sister Mary Cynthia's need for psychiatric help before I saw you with her yesterday, I am now.<eos> And I'm very grateful for your interest.<eos> There is a particularly gentle, and therefore suitable, therapeutic community near Birmingham, called Northfield.<eos> Because her family live there, we may be able to get her in.<eos> Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
I do believe you get to see your loved ones.<eos> I'm gonna see my mom.<eos> You really think she's up there?<eos> - Watching over you?<eos> - Yeah. Actually, I do.<eos> I even talk to her sometimes.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, don't you ever think about your dad or Angelo?<eos> I'd like to believe that we go on after we die, that there's life after this one, but...<eos> I don't.
Sycamore tree.<eos> That's a catbird nest.<eos> There's a length of frayed rope over here with blood all over it.<eos> This is definitely where Ian's body was hoisted.<eos> I got something, too.<eos> This is also where he was murdered.<eos> This portable speaker's made from the same plastic resin and magnesium alloy I found in the blunt force trauma to Ian's skull.<eos> But if Ian was killed here, why dump his body nearly a mile away?<eos> Come on, Bones, please tell me you got some prints off that portable speaker.<eos> We did not.
Ask you a few questions.<eos> When was the last time you saw Aldo Clemens?<eos> Sorry, don't know him.<eos> Look at the photo, Jake, okay?<eos> Clemens was found dead this morning.<eos> We know that you were his dealer.<eos> Okay. I think we're done here.<eos> I don't know anything about drugs.<eos> And just so we're super clear on that, I'm gonna go call my lawyer. Thanks.<eos> Okay, you do that.
Gyroscopic forces, acceleration due to gravity, friction.<eos> "Friction"?<eos> Don't you think that it's-it's good to not know how something works?<eos> I mean, come on, science takes the magic out of everything.<eos> There's no magic to begin with.<eos> It's just rules that govern the universe.<eos> Next thing you know you're gonna be telling her that rainbows are...<eos> Light refracted through water?<eos> - She already knows that.<eos> - Of course she does.
That car may look like hell on wheels, but you can't beat it in terms of toughness.<eos> So whoever this mysterious road bandit is... He built a car ideal for smashing and crashing.<eos> I know I might lose my James Beard Award if I say this, but I honestly think the simple appeal of diner food is... timeless.<eos> I'll tell you, I couldn't agree more, Doc.<eos> Well, unfortunately, both of your meals are... filled with saturated fats, which have been linked to... heart disease, high cholesterol and stroke.<eos> Bones, come on, we're trying to eat here.<eos> I'm just stating a fact.<eos> I understand that you're stating a fact, but we haven't seen Gordon Gordon in a while here.<eos> We may never see him again if he dies of a heart attack. She doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, I do.
"or I'll gut you like a pig and use your intestines as floss."<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That sounds pretty bad, huh?<eos> It sounds really bad, and honestly, it's not what I'd expect from the owner of Funtown.<eos> The one time I try to get tough with someone, they end up dead.<eos> This guy is pathetic.<eos> We can tear him down with fear.<eos> I know that you didn't kill Ron, okay?<eos> But I'm gonna need you to help me out here.<eos> Great, or we just do the opposite.
♪ La-Di-da-Di-Di... ♪ Hey, sorry to interrupt you guys.<eos> What?<eos> Booth, Avalon is here to see you.<eos> Avalon?<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> She said something about a vision.<eos> I-I don't know, I've never seen her so worked up, though.<eos> So I'm supposed to miss this whole party and all this dancing because she had a bad dream?<eos> I know neither of you believe in this stuff, but you...<eos> I don't.
There you are.<eos> Mellie...<eos> Advance is prepping the plane.<eos> I've asked besma to write some statements for our guys, spin for the press.<eos> And Renee is working on my speech.<eos> And we are looking into constitutional lawyers.<eos> We're gonna need the best...<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> Listen.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Anything.<eos> If Cyrus and Mcclintock shared so much as a look on the street, I want to know about it.<eos> Teddy, what?<eos> Yeah!<eos> What color is it?<eos> Teddy, honey, want to go draw mommy a picture?<eos> What a good one!<eos> He's dead, isn't he?<eos> And I think Cyrus may have had something to do with it.<eos> Of course he did.
Major Delane is my contact at Camp Robertson.<eos> I'm surprised he didn't tell me about the change in protocol.<eos> Well, the Major got promoted and was promptly shipped overseas.<eos> Didn't know the Army worked that fast.<eos> They do when they want to.<eos> The Major's not Army, he's a Marine.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who's buying all this weaponry?<eos> We don't need to have a situation.<eos> We already do.
The hunter.<eos> He's covering his tracks.<eos> There's another.<eos> Two of them?<eos> Maybe more.<eos> How many hunters have you seen out here before?<eos> A lot.<eos> Still wanna split up?<eos> We can deal with it. We just need to find Brett's trail.<eos> No, we don't.
The kidnapped girl who never got kidnapped?<eos> The struggling teacher with a sister in a mental hospital?<eos> The poor wife abandoned by her conman husband?<eos> You ever noticed how she's always the victim?<eos> Always the one who needs to be rescued?<eos> I don't know anyone who doesn't need a little rescue.<eos> Some people make a habit of getting rescued. Same way, other people make a habit out of jumping in after them.<eos> We decided together not to play.<eos> What gave you the right to do this?<eos> This does.
- I'm gonna go talk to Hackett.<eos> - Emily, wait, before you do...<eos> No, why wait?<eos> The girl's a snake.<eos> She needs to be kicked off the team.<eos> I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
You have arrived at your destination.<eos> - Are you...?<eos> - A.D.?<eos> You shot Spencer.<eos> You help Jenna escape.<eos> - You made up the game?<eos> - Correct.<eos> I barely know you, Sydney, why are you doing this?<eos> If this has anything to do with Jenna.....<eos> - It doesn't.
- I have to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, we'll figure this out.<eos> And, actually, I've to go meet Jillian to talk about a press schedule.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, are you sure you're okay?<eos> You're not still upset with me about...<eos> No, promise.<eos> He doesn't have anything on you, right?<eos> He does.
And that's what we're going to accomplish... together.<eos> What happened at the clinic?<eos> When we explained the situation they said they'd rush the blood test.<eos> You explained things?<eos> Sort of explained.<eos> What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Think about the mind that conceived this.<eos> Why build a dollhouse when you can turn the entire town into a dollhouse?<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Dodo you two wanna be left alone?<eos> I think I would just gotten assistant coach.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Who am I if I stay?<eos> Nobody wanted this.<eos> Somebody did.
I'm the person who should turn themselves in.<eos> If I hadn't have used the wrong credit card at this bar, then we would all be in the clear.<eos> None of this would have happened if I hadn't married whatever his name was.<eos> You guys, see what's happening here, right?<eos> I mean, this is why A.D's torturing us.<eos> This is exactly what they wanted all along.<eos> Us breaking apart.<eos> I mean, they already succeeded with Aria.<eos> Whether we pushed her out or she did herself she's gone.<eos> Aria definitely did it to herself.
Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?<eos> You know what it's like to be the outsider.<eos> I do.<eos> And when you move from friends and family...<eos> Yeah, it's the worst.<eos> I wouldn't wish it on anyone.<eos> It always seems like we're saying goodbye.<eos> Do you remember that kiss we shared?<eos> I do.
Take a symbolic grave and make it a real one.<eos> - Points for irony.<eos> - Points for being really sick.<eos> We get him out of there, we get rid of him, and that's it.<eos> Guys, guys.<eos> Just wait a minute.<eos> Wait for what?<eos> Do we really wanna do this?<eos> Nobody wants to do it, Aria, but we have to.<eos> - Do we?
Do you know that you're a psychopath?<eos> I assure you, I'm not the first CIA man to hide his life from his family.<eos> You hid it from the CIA.<eos> Look, you want to screw something up?<eos> Put a thousand people on it.<eos> You want to get it done right?<eos> Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
You want to get it done right?<eos> Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
- No idea. - Right.<eos> What happened up in Finger Lakes, do you know?<eos> Another gunshot victim came in from the same area at the same time.<eos> My brother-in-law was alone. It must be a coincidence.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Well, I'm heading out.<eos> I've done what I can.<eos> He's on life support up on three, but candidly, I don't think he's making it till morning.<eos> You had me running there for a bit, thinking I'd done something wrong.<eos> You did.
You really should tan and dye.<eos> We're trying to keep a secret here.<eos> _<eos> Super Max-powered zombies armed to the gills, ready to do battle once they're discovered?<eos> And I'm not supposed to say anything?<eos> Aren't we the "No Secrets" club?<eos> We're the "No Secrets Between Us" club.<eos> I think what they're doing here is smart.<eos> I mean, do we really believe there's going to be a "let's talk things out with the zombies" phase once the human population learns we exist?<eos> - I do.
After all, a wise man said, "One cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live."<eos> And what I've learned is, the best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.<eos> So, for you, a gift, the sword that you gave me, now laced with my venom.<eos> One slice will draw Klaus' blood and deliver the slow, agonizing death that he deserves.<eos> It would be my highest honor.<eos> Took a long time, but we finally caught you.<eos> Or maybe I just stopped running.<eos> Do you suffer, Niklaus, as my wife suffered?<eos> As my child suffered?<eos> Yeah, you do.
She probably knows. You know, right?<eos> - Not just the beans, the meat.<eos> - I'd say snot's pretty low.<eos> Maybe, like, five to ten, depending on the size of the pickin's.<eos> - The meat.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And you are both being disgusting.<eos> "The meat."<eos> You know, you used to have a jar that you kept all your boogers in?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - You absolutely did.
It is a sex thing.<eos> Don't pretend it's not.<eos> Ready?<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> - I... I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> Chew, swallow.<eos> The world will not implode, I swear.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Do it.
Don't pretend it's not.<eos> Ready?<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> - I... I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> Chew, swallow.<eos> The world will not implode, I swear.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.
Making a special trip to see them all in person, are you?<eos> Vicki took us over to Davy's memorial in the afternoon.<eos> We were back on the beach by four, waiting for the boat.<eos> Tourists aren't allowed there during nesting but she lets us go over.<eos> What time did you get home?<eos> We didn't. We always stay over in Ambersea.<eos> At the Westcliff Hotel.<eos> So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
- Do you know anything about that?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Gemma should've spoken to me before doing anything like that.<eos> And the judge said what?<eos> They said it was joint enterprise, but the whole trial was a joke.<eos> I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.<eos> But I don't.
- Let him go.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Now you're going to translate it for me.<eos> If this book holds all the Gifts' secrets, one of them must tell you how to get it back.<eos> There's no hope for you.<eos> I know that now.<eos> What about M.K.?<eos> What about M.K.?<eos> Does the book say how to unlock his Gift?<eos> I don't...
Don't be afraid to live by your own rules.<eos> Hey, if you ever try to blow a hole in a steel ship with us in it again, I will take that away. Got it.<eos> - Okay? - Yeah.<eos> Cheers, guys. Thank you.<eos> That was us not too long ago.<eos> Total noobs.<eos> Yeah, Rip yarded us in.<eos> You remember his speech?<eos> I know you don't. You were too busy running your mouth.<eos> Of course I do.
- He wasn't even in a wheelchair!<eos> - Well, yeah. Well, periodically, he is. And when he shows up in court, you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair!<eos> Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of shit, 'cause you're all the same... you're the same as all the others.<eos> Always on a high horse. Always trying to make me feel like I'm...<eos> Look, um, I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do all day, every day, so h-how about this?<eos> I-I won't fly jet planes... you, uh, stay out of court.<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> You know, guys like you... you think you're so damn smart, and you think you don't have to play straight with anybody.<eos> The wheel is gonna turn.<eos> It always does.
Call me when you want to talk.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did Frank confess?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
If they sell her out, which you know they want to do, then we all go down.<eos> - Maybe we should.<eos> - No!<eos> When are we gonna stop helping Annalise, when it only makes things worse?<eos> You are the only one getting us in trouble right now.<eos> Wes is dead.<eos> - Annalise probably killed him.<eos> - She didn't.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Frank did.
And Annalise showed up, worked her magic, and got you 10 years free.<eos> And now you're sitting here, paying her what she's owed.<eos> She don't look as good as she did in the paper.<eos> She's still trying to keep that weave tight, though.<eos> Why she ain't turning around?<eos> 'Cause she rude.<eos> Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.
Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> She loved that kid.<eos> No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.<eos> You deaf, bitch?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Why'd you kill that boy?<eos> I didn't.
Look at my babies!<eos> Give me a hug!<eos> Let's go sit.<eos> Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm the mother.<eos> You're the child.<eos> And the last thing you should be doing right now is worrying about me.<eos> It's just that I think we need to have a plan in place.<eos> I got that covered.<eos> - You do?
Why?<eos> She needed me to leak that article.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes. What's your problem?<eos> You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?<eos> No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive. And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
I'm no longer interested.<eos> The only thing left for you to do is to beg.<eos> Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.<eos> I've been a slave for the last seven years. I won't do it anymore!<eos> I will miss you when you're dead, but only for a minute.<eos> Then you will be forgotten by both time and the world.<eos> Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy. I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
I'm alright, Jimmy.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Good. I mean, I'm glad you're alright.<eos> I... Uh... can I come in?<eos> Just talk for a minute...?<eos> As you can see, I'm more than alright.<eos> I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better. You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
The boss wants you to settle this.<eos> I settle it right now, okay?<eos> You have to work together.<eos> It's what the boss wants.<eos> The boss can suck me.<eos> I'd watch what I say if I were you.<eos> Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family? We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
Yeah, I know, of course it is, but what I mean is it's not my ship.<eos> Yeah, but what would it cost to hitch a ride?<eos> You can't hitch a ride.<eos> You have to rent the whole ship.<eos> The boss charges 50K a leg, Linc.<eos> You want to get back to the States, it's 50K.<eos> 50K?<eos> We're just trying to get home.<eos> You know we don't have that kind of cash.<eos> You do now.
You know, before the operation, I didn't leave my house for a year.<eos> You don't have to now.<eos> Deliveries and online shopping. It was easy.<eos> Lonely, but easy.<eos> I was miserable before I got on the donor list, but now, after this change...<eos> I don't know who I am anymore, and that's... It's worse.<eos> At least before when I looked in the mirror, I knew who I was, and now... it sounds like bad lyrics, but there's a stranger looking back.<eos> We're going to begin what's called exposure therapy.<eos> We need to go back to the night of the accident.<eos> I don't...
Why, thank you, Jimmy.<eos> All right, then. You drive safe.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> Is that the last one, Or we got any stragglers coming through?<eos> Last one.<eos> Well, hey, thanks, 1FFfrancesca.<eos> You were great today.<eos> You, too.<eos> Those folks love you.<eos> Who doesn't?
Someone once asked me why I stick up for Mikey.<eos> They clearly don't have a brother.<eos> It could be any other game, honestly.<eos> Who beat me on any game?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really, now?<eos> I don't think you understand I own the arcade.<eos> No, you don't, but I do.
How'd they know to ask for 350 grand?<eos> We gotta find someone else. Someone more connected than Gus.<eos> There's nobody more connected then Gus.<eos> He's not doing shit.<eos> What do you think, he's gonna blow his cover, - for your fucking brother?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You think anybody in this fucking department gives a fuck about your deadbeat brother?<eos> - So there's no one else?<eos> - No.<eos> What do I do?

Could be?<eos> Camille's absolute favorite thing is holding grudges.<eos> I forgot her 607th birthday, which isn't even...<eos> I could forget about my 19th birthday if we don't find her.<eos> So, please, can you take a break from your day job and help a vamp out?<eos> Lucky for you, this potion will take a few hours to stew.<eos> But it'll cost you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I've been running low. - Hmm.<eos> A chick did that to you?
Is there, like, a YouTube tutorial I can watch?<eos> Practice makes perfect.<eos> Wait, are we in India?<eos> Welcome to Agra.<eos> Wait, Camille lives in India?<eos> Camille lives wherever she wants.<eos> Homes all over the globe.<eos> She's always liked to spend the winters in Agra.<eos> She loves the smell of lotus blossoms.<eos> Who doesn't?
We need to get you to Alec.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why?<eos> He tried tracking you with his parabatai rune, but now, it's like he's stuck in some kind of nightmare and can't wake up.<eos> He was looking for you, so you're the only one who can help him.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll... I'll get there.<eos> But you can't.<eos> The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
Maybe I can.<eos> Mom.<eos> Simon?<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> Oh, I thought something terrible had happened.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> There's something I need to tell you about where I've been and who I am.<eos> It's all right. I know.<eos> You do?
Oh, don't worry, little one.<eos> It's only a game.<eos> It's make believe, okay?<eos> Take her upstairs.<eos> And don't let anyone in unless her name is Clary.<eos> The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the Institute.<eos> You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
You have my word.<eos> But there are plenty of vampires more than eager to take a bite.<eos> I never should have left her alone.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Here's the address to the closest den.<eos> There's a good chance she's there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Azazel did this.
- Hold on.<eos> You're telling me that this burnout used repressed memories<eos> - to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped<eos> - off the Waverider.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - what you are talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I should never have brought Lily on board this ship.<eos> She found out.<eos> She knows she's an Aberration.<eos> Mr. Rory spilled the beans, as predicted.<eos> So what you gonna do?<eos> What can I do?<eos> Just tell her how you feel.<eos> She knows how I feel.<eos> It goes without saying.<eos> Yeah, for us, it does.
Not to tell you.<eos> The bank.<eos> They're...<eos> They're at the bank.<eos> Look, you could help yourself to... to whatever is in that safe deposit box, but please...<eos> Please, just...<eos> Just let me go, man.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Does this look like a spear to you?<eos> It most certainly does not.
Well, well, well.<eos> At least you're not shopping at Villains "R" Us anymore.<eos> I'm sorry about H.R.<eos> I'm sure he would have appreciated you coming.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do.
I don't know, but I kind of like it.<eos> She had something in her hand.<eos> She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, and I don't trust her, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that Prometheus forced her to do this.<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable Intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
Any progress on the facial recognition from the body cams?<eos> Sorry, but the Wi-Fi in here is incredibly slow.<eos> Well, you take your time.<eos> Got 3 patties and 3 slices of cheddar to go.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> Ok. Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name... Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
We need to find Boland before she gets involved in something that she can't handle.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. We're walking into a fortress, and you're gonna use just a bow?<eos> To use a bow and arrow requires patience and discipline.<eos> That's Yurievich.<eos> I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich... Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't... Sleep.
You're going to.<eos> Do svidaniya, Konstantin.<eos> My men overheard your conversation with that traitor Knyazev.<eos> The boat he's arranging will be here soon.<eos> Agh. I don't have to kill you, Oliver Queen.<eos> Agh! Only need to make sure you never get on that boat.<eos> You thought you could replace me?<eos> Ha ha ha! That's cute.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Oh, I did for so many reasons.
So if everyone involved in the accident takes the money, then Callie gets off.<eos> Hey, did you see Emma today?<eos> Uh, yeah, at school.<eos> They say if all the parties agree...<eos> Did she look okay?<eos> Did she go home sick?<eos> So if you can buy your way out of jail... does that mean Nick's gonna get out?<eos> Honey, she's been here everyday since you got home.<eos> She must've been feeling pretty funky.<eos> - What if he does? - Yeah.
- _<eos> - It's two steps forward, one step back.<eos> - The doctor's not worried about it.<eos> The only worry - _ is how it will affect Jesus's morale.<eos> Okay, so maybe comparing him to a cartoon character isn't very helpful.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Did you let students without permission slips take the sex ed class?<eos> Uh... Drew saw a comment from a kid online who says he was there.<eos> Of course he did.
Alright, let's get you outta here. Let's go.<eos> Hi! You wrote about my...<eos> You wrote about me on Twitter?<eos> I just heard a couple of kids trying to figure out who was pregnant in our class.<eos> Luckily for me, Natalie put on a few pounds this year.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> To me?<eos> To Jesus?<eos> - No one knows it was me.<eos> - I do!
Hmm, sorry to hear that.<eos> - You were together how long?<eos> - A few years.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> Because according to your ex-husband, you and Troy started having an affair about five years ago.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I'm gonna need you to answer me "yes" or "no."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So is that why you lied?<eos> - I didn't.
I think she means protecting him from me.<eos> Oliver, I still think it's a mistake not pushing this scum bag for the location of the sale.<eos> We don't have to. We're gonna have it within the hour.<eos> - What?<eos> - Bratva.<eos> Anatoly wasn't playing ball unless you did the Bratva's dirty work...<eos> Which is where you took Dinah.<eos> Oliver, I thought you didn't want anything to do with the Bratva.<eos> I don't, but if it's a choice between me crossing the line and the two of you crossing one, that is a very easy choice.<eos> What did you do?
And then you would say that.<eos> Look, Ollie, the only reason I didn't tell you was because I was trying to keep your hands clean.<eos> I know you care about her, so...<eos> I do care about her.<eos> I also care that you destroyed her reputation.<eos> She's gonna have a tough time finding a decent job.<eos> She's certainly not gonna find a job in journalism.<eos> You just blew up her life.<eos> Honestly, I... didn't mean for it to go this far.<eos> Yes, you did.
That was... that was too harsh, wasn't it?<eos> You think?<eos> Yeah. It was, um, but you know what?<eos> You recognized it.<eos> Yeah, because I'm...<eos> I'm... - I'm trying to work on it.<eos> - That's progress.<eos> Anyway, Paul's big problem with me being Mr. Terrific was the fact that he was worried, but now he doesn't have to worry with these bad boys in my arsenal.<eos> Sounds like you got the emotional logic all figured out.<eos> I do.
- He has leverage,<eos> - we need some of our own.<eos> - That's not gonna work.<eos> This guy always seems to be 10 steps ahead.<eos> Well, Oliver, it's pretty easy, you confronting him in public like that.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> Where you going now?<eos> According to city records, Chase's house has a subbasement.<eos> Chase does everything sideways, man.
He will never tell you truth in that much pain.<eos> Does this have to do with your deal with Kovar, yes?<eos> Samovol'shchnia.<eos> If you knew what it was or what is coming, you will beg Kovar to spare you.<eos> And you...<eos> Are no one's hero.<eos> Everything and everyone that you love will wither and die at your touch.<eos> Da.<eos> Good riddance.<eos> What do we do about Kovar?
Anatoly, I can't let you steal these drugs.<eos> It's not matter of "let."<eos> I have invitation to be here.<eos> Invitation?<eos> From whom?<eos> Oliver, have you brought Anatoly Knyazev to Star City?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And he just told me that his operation was nearly compromised by my team.<eos> Well, I said, "that's impossible. The team no longer exists."<eos> The hell it doesn't!
Wow. We need to check to see if this is cyclotrizane.<eos> On it.<eos> Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time. - Go!<eos> - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you.<eos> She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
It's a death grip.<eos> - You've seen this before?<eos> - Read about it.<eos> Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.<eos> They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.<eos> (GRUNTING) Ah, here it is.<eos> First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II<eos> - in the sixth dynasty.<eos> - Oh, my God. Does it say anything about how to stop it?<eos> Yes, actually, it does.
- Just a second.<eos> We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.<eos> Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...<eos> Do not attempt to interfere.<eos> No Burkhardt.<eos> I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
But the point is, if you're gonna spend all day fucking, shouldn't Pied Piper be a dude you wanna fuck?<eos> All right. Let's do an exercise. You've got unlimited time and resources, you can build anything in the world you want with your compression, anything at all, what's it gonna be?<eos> Three, two, one, go.<eos> Go, go, go. - You said I have unlimited time?<eos> - Now.<eos> A new Internet.<eos> What? Why?<eos> Okay. Well, I haven't really thought this through, so...<eos> - I own a telescope...<eos> - Of course you do.
No smoke coming from the chimney.<eos> I don't like the look of it.<eos> For a big, hard man, you scare easy.<eos> I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...<eos> Bald cocksuckers like you.<eos> You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot?<eos> Bald cunt.<eos> Come on.<eos> Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.<eos> They don't.
Were you going to say goodbye?<eos> I will see you when I return.<eos> But you don't know when that will be.<eos> No one knows.<eos> I wish you good fortune.<eos> Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.
What, like you being dead?<eos> I tasted that.<eos> I felt that. I just... I felt something.<eos> It felt like... Like alive.<eos> Do I feel alive?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't really know much more now than I did when I was alive, and I think whatever I know now that I didn't know then<eos> But I do know that I love you.<eos> I mean, I... I had to die to know just how much, but...<eos> I really do.
But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.<eos> You are huge.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Do not talk to him.<eos> Do not say a word. Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Sure I do.
What guard?<eos> You see that ash on that window?<eos> He come by every day right after the slop brought in.<eos> He share one of them cigarettes with some of the others. Probably the guy that opens that gate.<eos> Y'all notice he smell like smoke?<eos> Now, maybe if you made your move at dinnertime, you'd've got past the gate. But you'd've ran right into the marshal's office across the street.<eos> How you know where the marshal office is?<eos> You ever hear of the Macon 7?<eos> All the same, why you care we get ourselves kilt?<eos> I don't.
No, he wasn't.<eos> The driver wasn't drunk. He hit us on purpose.<eos> But I think you know that because you paid for his lawyer.<eos> Still think we have nothing to talk about?<eos> If you have a question for me, son... why not go ahead and ask it?<eos> Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it and make us look bad in the process.<eos> Call the mayor's office.<eos> Tell him we're on our way.<eos> We don't need Nygma for anything.<eos> He should be dead by now.<eos> He's obsessed with finding the answer, which is an easy solution for us.<eos> Once he does, we'll get rid of him.<eos> I promise.<eos> And how's him causing a scene at the theater help us?<eos> It doesn't.
What do you mean?<eos> Whowho's coming?<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I should cook him.<eos> - They want him alive.<eos> So I'll just cook part of him.<eos> No, my dear.<eos> - Let's be calm.<eos> - You don't have that kind of control.<eos> And you do?
Goodbye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets when you were knocked out.<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
You know what?<eos> You're right, Julian.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> And our deal was that I would train so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?<eos> We didn't go... we just thought maybe you could use some help.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What happened to, "Cisco, you can beat her"?<eos> - You can.<eos> - "I believe in you."<eos> - I do.
Iris.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Joe, I'm sorry...<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Joe already suspects something's up.<eos> You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.<eos> This story is going to change lives, Barry.<eos> Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?<eos> I don't.
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.<eos> But in quantum mechanics, the daughter universe theory tell us... - Universe theory. - For every decision you make, a universe exists where you don't.<eos> Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,<eos> Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all. But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
No?<eos> What do you...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Solovar's words mean nothing now.<eos> You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?<eos> I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.
So let's come up with the next best plan that doesn't involve murdering one of our friends.<eos> No, Cisco's right.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> One of us has to die.<eos> Hi. What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Now all of a sudden, I'm too slow?<eos> You're in your head.<eos> You gotta get out of your head, man.<eos> You gotta just run, you gotta push everything else to the side.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it!<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> - All right?<eos> All right. Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
I care about you, Caitlin. Show me.<eos> - Julian! - Come on, come on!<eos> Oh, boys... where are you?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Buying us some time.<eos> Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
What do you say?<eos> Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings and some book readings... lot of women left to charm, but I... I'm in.<eos> You know what?<eos> Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters.<eos> Maybe 10% off.<eos> On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
Did it not work?<eos> Do we need to try again?<eos> No, I went.<eos> I'm back.<eos> You're back?<eos> I went to the future.<eos> How far?<eos> Eight years from now.<eos> I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was.<eos> Did you?
Don't tempt me.<eos> The witches gave some magical help to a local metalsmith who was making a church bell for them.<eos> This bell had a special purpose.<eos> But what no one realized was that seline and I had befriended this metalsmith.<eos> We threw a little wrinkle into his plan.<eos> Wait... what are they doing?<eos> Call it extra credit.<eos> I found some descriptions of an antique church bell in your family estate records.<eos> Wait, we have an estate?<eos> Oh, we did.
No, you can't be serious.<eos> Use the whole can, children.<eos> Thoroughness is important.<eos> Violet, stop.<eos> Violet!<eos> - No, everybody stop!<eos> - Uh, hello?<eos> They're sirened.<eos> Oh, you brought the lighter.<eos> Of course you did.
I told you it doesn't mean anything to me.<eos> And I don't believe you.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - You seem troubled.<eos> You're not enjoying our work.<eos> Oh, my God, you are so full of crap.<eos> Fine, then prove me wrong.<eos> Prove that the past is behind us.<eos> Prove to me that you don't care.<eos> I don't.
Where's Karen?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's okay.<eos> I compelled her to wait by the road for the ambulance.<eos> They're on their way. Just hang with me.<eos> Caroline, it doesn't matter.<eos> Today, tomorrow...<eos> I know where I'm going and I deserve it.<eos> - No, you don't, okay?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You are going to keep fighting.<eos> You are going to live.<eos> You are going to stay alive so you can make all of this right.<eos> Stefan.<eos> Stefan.<eos> God.<eos> Cutting it pretty close.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> How do I know you're gonna keep up your end?<eos> You don't.
I thought you hated him for leaving us.<eos> That was a lifetime ago.<eos> Things have changed since then. I was...<eos> I was actually glad to hear from him.<eos> I was hoping we could all get dinner tonight.<eos> I'm not sure I'll be free.<eos> All right, professor, how do we get rid of the queen of hell?<eos> Are you sure Katherine's in our world?<eos> When Cade crossed planes after the 11th ring of the bell, other souls could step through, too.<eos> Same way Kai did.
When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.<eos> In this case...<eos> All of us in Mystic Falls.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride, little brother.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
I bet it hurt.<eos> A lot.<eos> Whoever did this is no better than he was.<eos> Lucifer. There's something very important we need to discuss.<eos> New visitors policy.<eos> Hot women turning up unannounced are no longer welcome.<eos> Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes. Actually, I do.
Well, normally, I would agree with you.<eos> But you insist on letting an impossibly attractive flight attendant come between us.<eos> And not in the fun way.<eos> Lucifer, we are very different people with very different personalities, and I'm not judging.<eos> I'm a homicide detective, not the slut police.<eos> And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
Well, I'm sure it must have made quite an impact on her.<eos> I mean, it, it is me.<eos> No doubt she's overwhelmed by emotions she's never felt before.<eos> She's overwhelmed?<eos> Is that why you went your separate ways after the kiss?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Yes, although she did have that wretched dependent waiting for her at home.<eos> Well, two, if you count the child.<eos> I think I know what's happening.<eos> Y-You do?
LAPD.<eos> It just won't stop.<eos> So, this is where the... healing happens.<eos> It's cute.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> I have some upsetting information to give to Lucifer.<eos> It's a revelation that might send him over the edge against his Father.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?
You got a package from CDC.<eos> How many more ingredients do we need?<eos> Well, based off the list from that middleman dude, we've gathered all but one:<eos> a chemical called ZX3.<eos> Super rare, super illegal.<eos> - How rare?<eos> - Let's put it this way:<eos> all my legal contacts are out of this stuff.<eos> Wait, you have illegal contacts?<eos> You don't?
I'm sure it won't be too painful, what with those soft hands of yours, right?<eos> That's, uh, that's for the burger.<eos> In short, the American hunters have proven... difficult.<eos> As for the Winchesters...<eos> You left them.<eos> No, I...<eos> Dean told me to go.<eos> The woman --<eos> The one you lost?<eos> I didn't.
Lucifer has a kid?<eos> Hey, what's the, Wi-Fi password here?<eos> Extra cheese.<eos> Everyone is clear on the plan?<eos> At 10:45, demon comes home.<eos> Sam and I will be waiting for him.<eos> I'll pop him with a Devil's Trap bullet.<eos> I'll finish him off with a demon blade.<eos> And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.<eos> Cool, cool. What do I do?
Brings me to your final gift...<eos> The Throne of Hell.<eos> You want me to be king?<eos> Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler.<eos> You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
Mary?<eos> A question.<eos> So?<eos> Thoughts on our little operation?<eos> And our team?<eos> Serena and Alton seem smart.<eos> Pierce...<eos> You know he calls himself.<eos> "The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?<eos> I do. Unfortunately.
Well, now Hayden's mom, she gets to bury two kids instead of one, thanks to you and thanks to your code.<eos> Nice work.<eos> I was kidding before, but you really do look like a creeper.<eos> Funny. How'd it go?<eos> BFF found. Beans spilled.<eos> Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.<eos> Texting constantly, ultra possessive.<eos> Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.<eos> Guess that explains why he was there.<eos> I did good, right?
I'm still gonna peel off your skin and eat your soul.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, it will be...<eos> little bit messy,<eos> Hmm.<eos> But...<eos> You know, gotta protect the rep.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
He was sweet and kind.<eos> And he loved me.<eos> More than I ever loved him.<eos> More than...<eos> If I'd just told him...<eos> If I...<eos> Why couldn't I just tell him the truth?<eos> ♪<eos> Gwen...<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
Talk.<eos> This is not what it looks like.<eos> Really? 'Cause it looks like a straight up murder room to me.<eos> Sheriff, what's goin' on?<eos> You... You won't believe me.<eos> Try us.<eos> We're pretty open mind.<eos> My family, we...<eos> Got a secret.<eos> All the best ones do.
And when in our whole lives have we ever been safe?<eos> This is my responsibility because it is my plan.<eos> Your plan?<eos> He's taking me to Heaven.<eos> You...<eos> You're taking her to the sandbox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm ending this, once and for all.<eos> Kelly and her baby have to die.<eos> No, they don't.
And you would know that if you would answer your phone.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> What you did with me, with... With Gadreel, remember?<eos> The... the grace extraction.<eos> We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.<eos> Human.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That extraction, it nearly killed you.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
But it was also...<eos> You're hurt.<eos> Thank you for coming to fight for us.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I am.<eos> I've been so lost.<eos> I'm not lost anymore.<eos> And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.<eos> You can't actually mean that.<eos> Yes. I do.
Because if you ask me if I have the quarter-inch Allen wrench one -- one more time, I am going to come down there and burn your giant Viking junkyard of a store to the ground!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> ! Are you sure it wasn't in the box?<eos> God!<eos> Kelly.<eos> I told you I'd put this together.<eos> I'm very good at following instructions.<eos> And you need to rest.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Kelly -- No, Cass, I don't.
Usually I gun down flyboys on sight.<eos> But, uh, he looked... different.<eos> Wasn't wearing a necklace made out of baby ears, for one thing.<eos> We got to talking about where I came from and our two worlds.<eos> From what he says, pretty much peaches and cream on your side.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
That's all.<eos> Here?<eos> Fine.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Talk.<eos> Why'd you plead innocent?<eos> Why'd you make us go through that trial?<eos> Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> Why?<eos> Just... do it.
Rest.<eos> He's right, you should rest.<eos> We're wasting away, you and I.<eos> We should be saving what's left of our strength to run.<eos> But to run we'll need skin on our feet and not rotting flesh.<eos> Then we should bail.<eos> These wretches all tell the same story, Lord.<eos> They flee slaughter at the hands of the brothers.<eos> We must surely be next.<eos> And what do I do?
It's over.<eos> Shield!<eos> Ragnar, no! No, no!<eos> No, Ragnar, don't give him the chance.<eos> Burn the bastard, Ragnar!<eos> - Brida! - You and me.<eos> Move!<eos> We make the square!<eos> Your sister made a good whore!<eos> She still does!
Let's see if he dies of natural causes.<eos> Explain yourself.<eos> The reason that I said I did not know anything about the snakes, is because I was being modest.<eos> You weren't being modest. You haven't been modest a day in your life.<eos> You were lying.<eos> Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
You give a good pool player that kind of advantage, your game's as good as over.<eos> Bobby, plenty of game left.<eos> Is there?<eos> Here.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll get you out faster with this to surrender.<eos> Well, you've had plenty of clients right where I am.<eos> What do they tell their kids?<eos> I got no fucking clue what to say to my boys.<eos> No one ever does.
In your other life.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Leah Camille.<eos> They'll crucify me in court.<eos> Not if we bring it up first.<eos> Get it out of the way. Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
She say who?<eos> No. Must be Holland's people.<eos> His lawyer or Rudy Tafero.<eos> O'Shea is gonna shit a brick.<eos> I feel his pain.<eos> What if the kid did?<eos> What if he saw me?<eos> Break.<eos> Will you relax?<eos> He didn't.
I'm glad that we could finally...<eos> Bring my mom into it.<eos> How's the finger?<eos> Those fuckers got away.<eos> What about the tag number?<eos> I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> I did.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
You know how he... he always goes on about he came from nothin', and he built an empire.<eos> His father owned half the communications in India. Half.<eos> Gave him the contracts to Mumbai when he turned 18.<eos> The very definition of born on third, thinks he hit a triple.<eos> Had silver spoons comin' out of every orifice.<eos> I came from dirt.<eos> I put my 20 in on the force.<eos> Saved every penny.<eos> And I built this.<eos> I did this. This.
Next thing I know, I'm underwater.<eos> I kept thinking, "Aw, I'll sort this out."<eos> "I'll dig out from this.<eos> My daughters... when they look at me, when they look at my face, they'll forgive me."<eos> Me and another cop... a guy named Dan... we did whatever Manny said, and he said, "Do terrible things."<eos> Now it-- It's happening all over again.<eos> He's gonna talk about all that now, Manny is, and when he does... that prosecutor's gonna give me the death penalty.<eos> Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't.
Charles McGill.<eos> - So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.<eos> - Objection.<eos> How are the hiring practices of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill relevant here?<eos> It's relevant to understand the relationship between these brothers.<eos> We'll, uh, give you some leeway, Ms. Wexler, but don't stray too far.<eos> Charles McGill is not the subject of this hearing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did Jimmy know his brother was the one that prevented you from hiring him?<eos> He did not.
What should I say to her?<eos> Well, she's your kid.<eos> You're not going to tell her she stinks on ice.<eos> You'll... You'll lie to her.<eos> Don't they ever have company?<eos> I mean, it must be awful.<eos> Well, I think you're good.<eos> Really good.<eos> You don't know what that means to me, coming from you.<eos> Sure, I do.
But they're all about her.<eos> Listen.<eos> "A brilliant tour-de-force."<eos> "A brave and naked portrayal."<eos> "You won't be able to take your eyes off Miss Davis."<eos> She has the critics, so what?<eos> You have the audience.<eos> You're the one they're rooting for, not her.<eos> You know, I-I really thought this film was going to be a flop.<eos> I really did, Hedda.
Stop.<eos> - Shut up, you asshole.<eos> - What?<eos> - It wasn't cute when you were 45, and it sure as hell isn't cute now.<eos> So stop it.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> You were never in my corner.<eos> All these years, you always thought Davis had more talent than I did.<eos> She does.
What do you guys know about Dover's war tunnels?<eos> To defend against Napoleon, Dover Castle was retrofitted with a multi-level tunnel network.<eos> And Napoleon never invaded, but the tunnels remain.<eos> Judging by this location, Bray's compound...<eos> Sits on or near those tunnels.<eos> Giving Bray easy access to move captives.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> If this compound sits on a tunnel... and let's admit that's a... that's a mighty big "if"... how do you suggest we get in or even know where we are?<eos> It's not like we have a map.<eos> No, the Middlesex Museum of British History does.
You okay?<eos> Is Bray alive?<eos> Anna, talk to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Anna Copeland.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody, just calm down.<eos> We're on the same side, fellas.<eos> It's okay. You don't have to do this, sweetheart.<eos> He has my son!<eos> No, he doesn't.
Okay?<eos> On one... two... three.<eos> Very good, sir. Very good.<eos> Howard was my inspiration... my partner, my friend.<eos> Standing next to him, you felt like... no matter what the day brought, nothing was gonna touch you.<eos> You've been told we lost our son.<eos> He was on the beach one moment and gone the next.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> We didn't lose Christopher.<eos> I did.
Aldon Braddock, the one-off.<eos> Everyone in the crew was in the same unit except Braddock.<eos> - So how does he fit in?<eos> - Through Jennifer Lin.<eos> Three years ago, she was attached to his Ranger unit.<eos> Those two new each other.<eos> Knew each other how?<eos> It looks like they had an affair, because after it ended, she had a restraining order against him.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Love never does, my friend.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here... online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.<eos> And before I do, I want to know if she told you about Whitehall.<eos> Is the network up yet?<eos> I got one last problem to solve.<eos> Kat's helping me with it.<eos> With what?<eos> Simple binary choice.<eos> Did she or didn't she?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No. She didn't.
You know why I came here?<eos> I came here to find out who my mother really is.<eos> And I wished to God I hadn't, 'cause you know what I found out?<eos> I found out that you're nothing but a criminal.<eos> You let your delusional father brainwash you.<eos> You're a cold, heartless killer... who'd murder her own son if it got her what she needed!<eos> Spying on me, deceiving me...<eos> Is it worth it, killing me?<eos> Is it worth Whitehall?<eos> Then do it.
And I didn't come here to narc on you over whatever you just put in your pocket.<eos> I came here to tell you something... something important.<eos> But first, Howard.<eos> - He was your mentor, right?<eos> - Why are you asking me?<eos> He gave you a second chance.<eos> Yeah, second... third.<eos> Howard saved me.<eos> I wish to God he never got on that airplane.<eos> He didn't.
There are guards, cameras!<eos> - Can you walk?<eos> - The most important thing... is that Scottie trusts you.<eos> If... if she knew you were helping me...<eos> Of course I'm helping you, Dad.<eos> Dad?<eos> You never called me that before.<eos> Command, I thought Deavers left.<eos> Didn't he say he was heading home?<eos> He did.
- Nice to meet you, Josh.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I made a delightful paella, and we're talking about how I'm gonna die.<eos> You'll know this.<eos> Can you make your own final meal?<eos> I'm on a low-sodium diet.<eos> I'll file a motion.<eos> That's my guy.<eos> Thank you so much for covering for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you. I did it for my dad.
- It's hard to say.<eos> - Where's the body?<eos> - Federal Center morgue.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> I may know a few people.<eos> I believe these are yours.<eos> Please don't leave me alone again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anyone ever tell you you have a kind face?<eos> I do?
Found out about what?<eos> That I was trying to defect to CIA.<eos> Two CIA officers were killed.<eos> - Langley says you set them up.<eos> - No, I didn't do that.<eos> I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But now they do.
And her family history suggests she's BRCA-1 positive.<eos> - That's the second.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But we don't have confirmation on that just yet.<eos> Her mother died of ovarian cancer.<eos> A strong support system is key in these kinds of studies.<eos> Okay, we are not gonna give up on her just because...<eos> Because her only family just walked out the door?<eos> Violet will come back.<eos> What if she doesn't?
Are you here to help or not?<eos> Done the vein.<eos> Great.<eos> Let me do the ex-fix before you move on to the artery.<eos> Yep.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Still ice cold and pale.<eos> I hate to say it, but...<eos> Then don't.
Well, down but not out, you know?<eos> It's gonna be a long road, Fernando, but if everything goes well, you should be able to ride again.<eos> Maybe motorcycles aren't for me.<eos> I thought you wanted to go on that ride with your dad.<eos> I guess I'm saying, he can take me or leave me how I am.<eos> You saved my leg, but now it's time I stand on my own two feet, you know?<eos> Yeah. Screwed-up dads.<eos> Everyone seems to have one.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Luke did all right.
I needed time to process.<eos> To separate what my mom wants from what i want...<eos> I think i want.<eos> Which is?<eos> My mom says i should never speak to you again.<eos> But i...<eos> Even though you don't like me like that,<eos> I still want us to be friends...<eos> Best friends.<eos> You do?
Varsity football, ap music tutorials.<eos> This morning, in the hallway, you wouldn't meet my eyes.<eos> Why?<eos> I was distracted. I wasn't feeling well.<eos> Archie...<eos> If there's something you want to get off your chest, Perhaps about jason, now would be the time.<eos> Weatherbee just asked me if i knew anything about jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing. That i didn't.
All right, you all ready?<eos> Let's make some noise!<eos> Put your hands together for the riverdale bulldogs!<eos> Cheryl?<eos> Cheryl, what is it?<eos> What happened?<eos> Jason.<eos> he's gone... i know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
People who want to buy crack.<eos> And cinephiles, and car enthusiasts.<eos> Right, Bets?<eos> Totally.<eos> Anyway, it's closing because the town owns it, but didn't invest in it.<eos> So when an anonymous buyer made Mayor McCoy an offer, she couldn't refuse...<eos> Anonymous buyer?<eos> What do they have to hide?<eos> No one cares.<eos> I do!
Oh, Archiekins...<eos> You're in it deep this time.<eos> Turn down the music.<eos> I spy with my little eye Hermione Lodge, full of secrets.<eos> Riddle me this, hair models of the damned, why is Veronica's mother having a clandestine tete-a-tete with a Southside Serpent behind a dumpster at Pop's?<eos> How hard it would even be, if I've me a little heads-up?<eos> Look, I am, by nature, a conscientious objector.<eos> Not saying anything to either you or Betty, was the most moral, apathetic choice I could make.<eos> But, Jug. She's not going to write about me and Grundy in the paper, is she?<eos> Like she did with Chuck?
- Archie... - Why the new identity, the moving place-to-place?<eos> Tell me the truth, please.<eos> I...<eos> Was in a bad relationship.<eos> A relationship...<eos> I was married to a man who would come home from work every night, late, and drunk, and with a temper.<eos> One night, I ended up in the emergency room with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone.<eos> The next morning, he barely even remembered the fight, and he promised that it wouldn't happen again.<eos> But...<eos> It did, again.
As in Sheriff Keller?<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Is this a problem?<eos> I won't tell if you won't.<eos> I never thought that I would live to see the day.<eos> I thought the one thing that we could keep our Riverdale safe from was child predators.<eos> Ms. Grundy's not a predator.<eos> She's a good person<eos> Archie, you don't have to defend me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
"Crazy runs in that family."<eos> Like mother, like daughter.<eos> - You wouldn't dare.<eos> - I'll quit.<eos> I'll quit my job.<eos> Will that satisfy you?<eos> Yeah, it will.<eos> It has to. And I absolutely would dare, Mom.<eos> She has to leave town.<eos> - The hell she does.
She's 10 years old and listens to Pink Floyd on vinyl,<eos> I don't think she could get any cooler.<eos> How was your jam session?<eos> It was great, until FP told us you forced him out of the company he helped found.<eos> That's his story, wanna hear mine, hmm?<eos> FP was a mess.<eos> He was stealing from the company and selling stuff on the side.<eos> All things considered, I was pretty generous.<eos> So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.
What can I say? I'm a movie buff.<eos> So, tell me, were you upset when Hiram Lodge bought the drive-in land?<eos> Stuff happens.<eos> Let me rephrase that question.<eos> Were you surprised?<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Right this way.<eos> I thought you said she wanted me to be here.<eos> She does.
There was one time I overheard a conversation between FP and Mustang...<eos> - Who's Mustang?<eos> - He's another Serpent.<eos> The only other guy who knew about the clean-up.<eos> The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.<eos> I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> - Where is Mustang? - No, no, no, no.<eos> You do not want to go see him.<eos> Yes, I do.
Are you sure you should be performing?<eos> Freshman year, I played the whole season with a broken hand.<eos> Well, a taped-up hand.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> When we were at Southside High, you were looking at Betty and Jughead...<eos> I don't know, wistfully.<eos> - Wistfully?<eos> - Longingly.<eos> Like you liked Betty.<eos> I do.
It's my family!<eos> You let them go, I'll give you that shot you've been hoping for.<eos> I swear.<eos> Once I know they're safe, I'll stand there and let you pop rounds off all day.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna keep coming until I either find them or die, but chances are, it's gonna be someone else's kill, not yours.<eos> Be at the Great Meadow Golf Course, one hour.<eos> If you bring the evidence, you have my word I'll release your family.<eos> You don't give a shit about the evidence.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Me.<eos> I'd like to kill you.<eos> But if I do, more Russians keep coming.<eos> If I kill them, it's tied off on their side.<eos> But...<eos> I want what you're giving Payne.<eos> What makes you think I want him dead that badly?<eos> 'Cause they're amateurs, and you're thinking about it, which means you still get paid even with them dead.<eos> I didn't think you were a man that cared about money.<eos> I don't.
He did it.<eos> Jafar... he admitted he killed Danny Nasiri.<eos> He killed.<eos> He killed to prevent the deaths of God knows how many other innocent fellow citizens.<eos> Now, we all hear them tell us,<eos> "If you see something, say something."<eos> Well, Jafar...<eos> He saw something.<eos> But he took it one step further.<eos> He did something about it.
I should probably check your grades. - Make sure you're not...<eos> - Whoa! I earn my grades.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Man, don't judge her.<eos> That's not what's going on.<eos> I am not "man." I am Mr. Rankin.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me how the four of you ended up together?<eos> Why wouldn't the four of us be together?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I don't.
It's funny, I thought this whole thing... was about following through with something good.<eos> Different.<eos> At the end of the day, I think... people like Smerconish, they're the ones who always win.<eos> I think... we did what we had to do.<eos> I'm not coming back to school in the fall.<eos> What?<eos> Why? We just saved the school.<eos> I just don't want to be my dad's legacy here.<eos> I want to leave all of that behind.<eos> With the statue and everything that we did here tonight.
Then you can leave.<eos> All right, then.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Full name?<eos> - Foster Farrell the 8th.<eos> What's yours?<eos> Wade Houghton.<eos> So... you know Asa Farrell?<eos> That's the man we're lookin' for.<eos> I do.
You're lyin'.<eos> I see it all over you.<eos> You know that day up there, you ran like you was afraid of somethin'?<eos> But it wasn't us.<eos> What were you afraid of, Wade?<eos> He do it?<eos> He the killer?<eos> No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
We're trying to find any leads possible to help us capture Alex Romero.<eos> I get that you didn't like him, but he was your step-father.<eos> You must know something, who his friends were.<eos> Well, as far as I know, Alex Romero had no friends at all.<eos> He was a lonely, very unhappy man, and I think that's why he latched onto my mother so completely and didn't want anyone else in her life.<eos> I can't help but feel that his escape has something to do with him coming back here for some unfinished business.<eos> The tie-in to Jim Blackwell is too huge a coincidence.<eos> Do you have any idea what that reason might be?<eos> No.<eos> No, I... I don't.
Yes, but Jeff is feeling a little enthusiastic, and I think it's safe to assume that this is not his only briefcase of cash.<eos> Mr. Lowery?<eos> I was wondering, with Janet leaving...<eos> I'd like to submit myself for her position.<eos> You're interested in Janet's job?<eos> Yes, I've been here for three years.<eos> I think I've shown my value.<eos> I have my notary license.<eos> Well, Marion, I... I don't mean to be harsh, but, may I ask, do you have a college degree?<eos> No, I don't.
No, I, um...<eos> I just... just woke up.<eos> Hey, I just wanted to thank you so much for the dresses. It's kind of crazy.<eos> They fit perfectly.<eos> And I absolutely love them.<eos> I-I'm so glad.<eos> Yeah, and I get such a vibe off them, Of your mom...<eos> What a cool lady she was.<eos> She had great taste.<eos> Yes, she... she certainly did.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> She got sick, and she just died.<eos> My dad didn't want me, so he sent me to live with my aunt in Miami.<eos> There was more food, but not much else.<eos> When I was 15, I got a bus to Seattle, and I've been on my own ever since.<eos> Well, that's quite the story.<eos> And how did you end up in Los Angeles?<eos> Like a book, we've all got a lot of chapters.<eos> Yes, no.<eos> That we do.
We are partners now, Norman.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> We are on even footing.<eos> Your father was a bad and scary man.<eos> You wanted to protect her from him, but you couldn't.<eos> I did want to.<eos> Mother, it killed me that I was so small, that there was nothing I could do.<eos> But you thought about it.<eos> You thought, "when I'm big enough, I'll kill him."<eos> I did.
Attention.<eos> Sheriff, I... I am lonely.<eos> And I have spent the last... two years pretending to know more than I do.<eos> But I... am not lying about this.<eos> I-I killed Sam Loomis... and I watched his eyes go blank.<eos> I did. Me, Norman.<eos> I-I did that.<eos> That is one thing that I know for sure.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I don't...
Norman is not a bad person, and he's not a criminal.<eos> What do I need to know about him?<eos> He has another side to him.<eos> I don't know what you'd call it. Maybe multiple personalities.<eos> I'm the only one who's gonna protect you.<eos> It's time for me to fix this.<eos> Turn to your left, please.<eos> Okay, if you could step up to the desk, please.<eos> I need to take your prints.<eos> Wha... what do I do here?
Man, I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> The rain is just a nightmare.<eos> It's fine.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good, how are you? - Good.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have your license?<eos> I don't have a Blockbuster card.<eos> Yeah, neither does anyone else.
I need to talk to the sheriff.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> It's just awful.<eos> I'll meet you at the house.<eos> Bye, Hun.<eos> Oh, I just heard about Kevin.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna go to Christine's.<eos> You want to come?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay.
Now they pretty much stick to the Green Zone and let the rest of us rot down here.<eos> And this is where Charlie has been living.<eos> Will you help me find him? Of course.<eos> You got any leads?<eos> I think he's in a street gang, working for a warlord named Solomon.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That bad?<eos> At least he's usually willing to deal.<eos> But we got to get in his front door first.<eos> How do we do that?
Tom... this isn't your story.<eos> You've always said you couldn't've had a happier childhood, or a better life.<eos> That was before I witnessed a woman giving up her child.<eos> Before I was in the room watching her crying.<eos> What about her story?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There are no photographs of me as a child.<eos> I didn't think I minded.<eos> But now I've seen one.<eos> And I do.
We need someone who can roll their sleeves up, and not collapse when they see an East End privy.<eos> None would disagree who have toiled in these environs.<eos> The trouble is nursing treats young working class girls the way the world treats women.<eos> They're all over them when there's a war on. Afterwards, nobody wants to know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shelagh?<eos> You must've seen babies that lived as long as mine did.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do they have fingers and toes?<eos> Yes, they do.
He's not going there.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not ever. And if I could've brought them all home with me, I would have.<eos> Well, that means he's stuck with us, then.<eos> Where are they going?<eos> Work. Where we all have to go.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - What's wrong with your face? It's like a long wet weekend.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Yes, you do.
Those are choices.<eos> Money is not peace of mind. Money's not happiness.<eos> Money is, at its essence... that measure of a man's choices.<eos> Well, we're really just getting started looking at, uh, interviewing, I guess you'd say, financial advisors. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Sure.<eos> You're doing your due diligence.<eos> Mr. Byrde, we don't know...<eos> Call me Marty.<eos> Marty, we don't know that much about stocks and investing.<eos> Well, I kinda do.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll put your name on the list.<eos> Whitney!<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I'm in Paris for a little while.<eos> I...<eos> I saw Furkat. He told me you were here.<eos> So you just happened to be in Paris?<eos> No, no, I have a... I have a friend here.<eos> Of course you do.
Who told you to treat him?<eos> No one.<eos> Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?<eos> I seem to remember you.<eos> - But you treated him anyway?<eos> - I did, yes.<eos> I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful, especially on someone of that age.<eos> You could have infected yourself and others.<eos> You could have devastated the entire Citadel.<eos> But you didn't.
We can buy mercenaries.<eos> Not the same as our men, but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.<eos> I just saw the Dothraki fight.<eos> They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen.<eos> Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.<eos> Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.<eos> Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.<eos> They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.<eos> This isn't a war we can win.<eos> So, what do we do?
Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger... because it's our best chance.<eos> The King in the North should stay in the North.<eos> We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.<eos> But perhaps we should have.<eos> The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.<eos> You are very kind, my lords. But Jon is our king.<eos> He is doing what he thinks is best.<eos> I warned Jon this would happen.<eos> That he couldn't leave the North and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.<eos> He didn't.
Sounds alright so far...<eos> And put leeches on me!<eos> - Was she naked too?<eos> - She needed your blood.<eos> - Yes, thank you, I know that.<eos> - Could've been worse.<eos> She wanted to kill me.<eos> And would have killed me<eos> - if it wasn't for Davos...<eos> - But they didn't, did they?
In my self-criticism, I acknowledged the mistake I made in contacting my previous family in Seattle.<eos> Tuan, that wasn't why we were...<eos> it's alright.<eos> My organization will forgive me.<eos> I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.<eos> But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.
How should we spend it?<eos> Marius was here last night.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him.<eos> - Why didn't he?<eos> - I made him back down.<eos> What?<eos> Why? Why? Because he would have been killed, and so would you.<eos> And I already have Charlie's death on my hands.<eos> We all do.
And after my court hearing on Monday, I'm gonna return.<eos> I want my money ready.<eos> Why?<eos> Because my angel-faced little cousin Carly is the fucking devil.<eos> She's the one who took it to Audrey.<eos> And apparently, she's also been talking to Taylor about me.<eos> Well, then, you have a major crack in the damn, Marius, because that cop is gonna run Pete's name sooner rather than later, and it's not gonna be your face that pops up, is it?<eos> If the truth comes out, it's gonna be a shit storm to end all shit storms, because you'll go back to prison.<eos> And Eddie can say goodbye to his fingers.<eos> So I don't... what do I do?
They'll kill you.<eos> You understand me? Yeah.<eos> Well, they're gonna have to.<eos> Listen, you better stick to the fucking plan.<eos> Otherwise, we're all dead.<eos> I'm sticking to the plan. I'm sticking to the fucking plan.<eos> I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm gonna beat the clock. I'm telling you. That's what I'm saying.<eos> What if you don't?
It is about us.<eos> It is about doing something important for us.<eos> And... and I don't want you to let fear get in the way. Of doing something great.<eos> Why do you always gotta go to that?<eos> I don't "always" do anything.<eos> Just 'cause I don't wanna do something.<eos> Doesn't mean it's fear. It... sometimes I don't wanna do something.<eos> Just 'cause I don't wanna do it.<eos> So you don't wanna do it?<eos> Maybe I don't.
Hey! I'm so glad you came.<eos> Did you get a drink?<eos> Let's get you a drink.<eos> Come with me.<eos> All right.<eos> This is gonna be great on you.<eos> Yeah. That does look good.<eos> Well, we have to look very hard to find something. That wouldn't look good on you.<eos> Well, I don't know about all that.<eos> I do.
Or stuff they can make better.<eos> But he can't change the past any more than I can.<eos> Honey, people fight because they're in pain.<eos> You are in pain still because of what down 'tween the two of you.<eos> And I'm sure he went through his own pain himself.<eos> Come on, you get that.<eos> That's the last thing I wanna do 'cause it's what mama would've done.<eos> And you know she had that mile-wide mean streak.<eos> And frankly, I'm... I'm scared that I have it, too.<eos> You don't.
But he can't change the past any more than I can.<eos> Honey, people fight because they're in pain.<eos> You are in pain still because of what down 'tween the two of you.<eos> And I'm sure he went through his own pain himself.<eos> Come on, you get that.<eos> That's the last thing I wanna do 'cause it's what mama would've done.<eos> And you know she had that mile-wide mean streak.<eos> And frankly, I'm... I'm scared that I have it, too.<eos> You don't.<eos> All right, you do not.
And if you can't see your way through, Then I'll see it for you.<eos> What happened?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> She just peed.<eos> You want me to take her?<eos> She just peed on my legs. And I felt it.<eos> What?<eos> I felt it!<eos> My god!<eos> I did!
Exactly.<eos> Well, what are you looking for?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> Well, no pressure.<eos> But just so you know, there is a lot of interest.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The neighbourhood's really hot right now.<eos> Some great restaurants, clubs in the area, if you like to go out.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You guys know each other, right?<eos> - Of course. Hey.<eos> - Good to see you guys.<eos> - You, too.<eos> - They're starting.<eos> How do you know Zach?<eos> Oh, we met at a benefit.<eos> You know, I'm not surprised.<eos> - He knows everybody.<eos> - He really does.
Yeah, well, sometimes those things turn out to be true.<eos> You did.<eos> What?<eos> You think I should do it now?<eos> Well, I was listening to him on the phone, and I started thinking maybe this is right, you know.<eos> Maybe we should just accept our good fortune.<eos> Just not before we talk to Sheila, though.<eos> Oh, of course, I'm gonna have a lawyer look at the contract.<eos> I have a feeling she'll find a million loopholes that are just gonna screw us over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
But then sometimes he's just like completely gone.<eos> Well, my baby, I would spare you all the hurt in the world if I could, but I can't.<eos> I fell in love with a messed up alcoholic.<eos> Wasted years of my life trying to figure that out.<eos> Got it wrong most of the time.<eos> I mean, we're good now, but... I'm not sitting in judgment of anybody.<eos> I just hope...<eos> What?<eos> I just hope you know you deserve to be happy.<eos> Everybody does.
No.<eos> It's just never really been your thing, you know.<eos> Neither was being paralyzed in a plane crash.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Look, Juliette, if this helps you, I'm all for it.<eos> I'm not just doing this because it helps me.<eos> It goes so much deeper than that.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> I... I want to know.<eos> No, you don't.
Why would I be kidding?<eos> W-Well, it's not exactly what you've done.<eos> Which is why I want to explore it.<eos> Well, I just... I don't think it's a great idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know why.<eos> Come on, aren't we all equal in the eyes of God?<eos> I don't know how to say this.<eos> But, honestly, if that's how you're looking at it, then you really don't understand the problem.<eos> I do.
I don't do the things you're asking me to do.<eos> I don't move the way you're asking me to move.<eos> You shown me what I really look like in my own mind.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.<eos> If you will let me, I think I can help Highway 65 flourish.<eos> I want us to write our story.<eos> You don't wanna do it?<eos> Baby, I don't.
If you're lucky, lots of times.<eos> I remember the day that Deacon and I were together.<eos> We were at his lake house in the woods.<eos> It was a beautiful misty day, and we just had this huge fight.<eos> I don't remember what it was about.<eos> And I got so mad I just decided I'm walking away.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> But as I walked away, I remember thinking to myself, but if he comes after me right now and he gets me, then I'll be with him forever.<eos> And he did?
Honestly, Julia, I love you, but you're crazy.<eos> I'm in pain, okay?<eos> It feels like my leg is rotting<eos> - ...from the inside out!<eos> - Okay, okay... Okay.<eos> I will schedule an appointment with the doctor on Monday.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to wait until Monday.<eos> I want to see her tomorrow.<eos> Of course you do.
We got a couple of people out there.<eos> But they said they only wanted immediate family in here.<eos> The nurse wants you to rest.<eos> Oh, they could come in and say hi.<eos> All right.<eos> You look good, Mom.<eos> Oh, honey, when'd you get to be such a good liar?<eos> Oh, hey, y'all.<eos> Bucky, you didn't have to come sit over here all night.<eos> - Of course I did.
- She has a broken pelvis!<eos> - That can happen with the type of fracture that your wife sustained.<eos> Fat tissue from the bone marrow can leak into the blood system.<eos> And just start wreaking havoc through the body.<eos> You can do something, right?<eos> You'll fix that?<eos> Not a lot, unfortunately.<eos> We just try to stabilize her.<eos> And wait for the circulation to clear on its own.<eos> And if it doesn't?
She knows, baby.<eos> She's always known, sweetie.<eos> She knows that.<eos> Is there anything else you can do here, please?<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yes, sweet girl?<eos> Do you think she knows we're here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
"My East and West.<eos> "My working week, my Sunday rest.<eos> "My Noon...<eos> "Midnight...<eos> "My talk...<eos> "I thought that love would last forever.<eos> I was wrong."<eos> - Hey. I'll take that for you.<eos> I never know what to say at these moments.<eos> Oh, nobody does.
I've been thinking about you so much.<eos> And, like, remembering when my mom died.<eos> I never dealt with it.<eos> People just kept telling me to be a man.<eos> Whatever that's supposed to mean.<eos> I just... i figured a man Wasn't supposed to feel anything.<eos> You were all alone?<eos> Thing is that's exactly what I did to you.<eos> - I let you down.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- Love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> This city just makes you feel alive, doesn't it?<eos> You know, I don't really have the best memories of it, but...<eos> Well, now you're with me.<eos> So we're just gonna make a bunch of new ones.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Zach cares.<eos> He really does.
Listen to it a few times before you make your decision.<eos> Because this single can make or break your album.<eos> I really appreciate you looking out for me.<eos> I really do, but I have been waiting so long to make my music my way.<eos> Maddie, this is still your song.<eos> But songs evolve and sometimes you have to just let them.<eos> But this didn't evolve on its own.<eos> You changed it!<eos> And I'm sorry, but I liked it the way it was.<eos> Of course, you do!
- Uh, no, sir, I do not.<eos> - You did a rolling stop back there.<eos> Uh, back where, sir?<eos> May I see your license, insurance, and vehicle registration, please?<eos> You didn't roll through any stop signs.<eos> Uh, my license is in my wallet.<eos> And my registration and insurance is in the glove box.<eos> Is it okay if I reach for it?<eos> But, which stop sign did we roll through?<eos> Because we didn't.
Dad, she did nothing wrong.<eos> She's helping.<eos> I didn't say she did anything wrong.<eos> I know she didn't...<eos> So you're gonna put her back in the streets?<eos> No...<eos> Look.<eos> We know she has parents.<eos> - We know that now.<eos> - No, no, she doesn't.
- I'm here to see her.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll see about...<eos> - something. - Thank you.<eos> Well, girl, you have made quite a splash.<eos> - It's so not funny, Juliette. - I know, I know.<eos> It feels like the whole world is looking at you.<eos> But do you feel like you did something wrong?<eos> No, I don't!
- Okay,<eos> - I'm coming in.<eos> - No. That's not what I meant.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.<eos> They all think I'm this spoiled brat.<eos> - Oh, come on...<eos> - I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.
I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.<eos> They all think I'm this spoiled brat.<eos> - Oh, come on...<eos> - I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
You doing okay, need a ride or anything?<eos> Yes, and no.<eos> Well, all right then.<eos> You can see it for yourself, Alicia, this crowd is so ready for the final two nights of Music City's Music Week.<eos> We got Dierk's Bentley, Little Big Town,<eos> Chris Stapleton, The Exes, and of course, the first live performance by Juliette Barnes since that plane crash earlier this year.<eos> Aside from bringing you a new artist, I was thinking about big media integration... Uh, Deacon!<eos> Just the man I want to see, let me introduce you to Casadee.<eos> - I know Deacon. - Hey, Cass.<eos> How you doing?
I think I do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Uh, nothing.<eos> Just people being mean.<eos> I just reacted, you know.<eos> I didn't even think.<eos> And now everyone's making me into all types of things.<eos> And even you think it was my fault.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I didn't, baby.
But isn't true success doing what you love?<eos> Doing it well?<eos> Isn't that why Rayna started this label?<eos> And sometimes doing what you love leads to utter failure if you're not careful.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't like what happened to you, Juliette.<eos> - No.<eos> It's worse.<eos> - How's it worse?<eos> Because I was an established artist who had the luxury of taking a chance.<eos> - Hallie does not!
Don't worry.<eos> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> I am.<eos> Are you gonna give in?<eos> Would you please have a little compassion?<eos> She's basically lost everything.<eos> Anyway, your whole world is opening up.<eos> I lost everything too.<eos> I know.<eos> We all did.
You did!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - No, I mean, the handsome and charming bit.<eos> - You did!<eos> You did too.<eos> No, I wouldn't talk about it in this setting.<eos> Honey, we've gotten so far off topic.<eos> I'm the one that's sitting here completely exposed.<eos> No, I didn't have an affair.<eos> I don't...
♪ I'd draw a straight line ♪<eos> ♪ As the crow flies ♪<eos> ♪ As the crow flies ♪<eos> - Thank you guys.<eos> Thank you. - Thank you so much.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'll see you next time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I remember you.<eos> No, you don't.

- You expect me to believe that?<eos> - It's not what you think.<eos> You know, I'm not real capable<eos> - of thinking at this moment...<eos> - Jeff is a guy who loves me!<eos> That's great.<eos> - And you love him?<eos> - No! I used to, but I haven't in a very long time.<eos> - So why do you call him?<eos> - I don't.
Well, I don't think that she would have invited me in if she were angry.<eos> I'm not talking about her being angry with you, Jessie.<eos> I'm talking about her being angry with me, for sharing her private business with a complete stranger.<eos> Well, I explained that you didn't mean to tell me.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I don't understand why you would reach out over something that's so personal.<eos> Because it's personal to me too, Deacon.<eos> I've lost pregnancies and I wanted her to know that someone out there understood.<eos> - I'm sorry, Jessie.<eos> - I didn't...
- And nothing.<eos> We just talked about all kinds of stuff.<eos> Birds,..<eos> He's pretty cool.<eos> And then you kissed?<eos> No!<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I... I kind of wanted to.<eos> All right.<eos> But at the same time, I really didn't.
Well, Tom is over the moon about this idea.<eos> And once he's over the moon...<eos> We need you to make her okay with it.<eos> - I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Guys, we're gonna start with that one, all right?<eos> Michael, did you get the changes to the end of "Good Rain?"<eos> Yes, I did.
I can't.<eos> I got like 10 things I got to go to right now.<eos> I'm not asking you, Deacon.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> Get in.<eos> Whatever this is, I'm not doing it.<eos> Just get out of the car.<eos> Jessie, I don't have time for this.<eos> - You do have time.<eos> - No, I don't, Jessie.
They're just friends.<eos> I'll go first, and then you.<eos> Count.<eos> Eighth grade is really gonna suck!<eos> What?<eos> I mean, if it's anything like this party.<eos> It's filled with stupid people.<eos> Present company excluded.<eos> How do you know I'm not stupid?<eos> I don't.
She's part of a support group that may or may not be a death cult.<eos> Holden drew an arch that looked just like that.<eos> So... what does Holden have to do with these people?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But you should stay away from them.<eos> Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
It's just getting my family back together felt like the one thing I could control.<eos> Maybe we couldn't beat the RAPs, but at least I could do that.<eos> And now?<eos> I don't know what's waiting for me on the other side of that wall.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The rest of your life.<eos> I liked those stories we read, especially about the fish who got too big for the pond.<eos> That's a really good one.<eos> You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you?<eos> No. I don't.
You're working here, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you know, it's temporary.<eos> You know, it's... the coal plant closed.<eos> I got kids, so...<eos> How old are your kids?<eos> Lila's 17. Nate's 11.<eos> You got kids, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't remember me.<eos> Stevie Johnson.<eos> Stevie, yeah. How are you, man?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I told Stevie you were in town. He invited himself over for dinner.<eos> Wasn't gonna miss this.<eos> What's it been, 25 years, 30?<eos> You disappeared, brother.<eos> - But I read your book. - You did?<eos> We all did.
- Don't touch me! Whitney, you can't go with that man!<eos> He attacked your father.<eos> - He was defending me.<eos> - You were inside!<eos> I don't know what the hell you think you saw, but he was not defending you.<eos> He-he...<eos> This has to end right now.<eos> He's twice your age and he's using you.<eos> You have no fucking idea what you're talking about!<eos> Yes, I do!
I promise.<eos> I'll tell him to leave right now. Yeah?<eos> And then what?<eos> Fuck!<eos> You can do what you want, Helen.<eos> Because I get how this goes.<eos> He leaves now, and then the next time, three months later or three years or tomorrow, whenever he shows up with his bullshit, you let him right back fucking in.<eos> I mean, I-I really don't understand it.<eos> I have tried.<eos> But I don't.
- No, I have to.<eos> The kids could come down. And they shouldn't see me.<eos> The kids?<eos> Also, I don't belong here, Helen.<eos> You've been very nice, but...<eos> You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.

I know you.<eos> I know who you really are, and I forgive you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do. You don't.
I know who you really are, and I forgive you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do. You don't.<eos> - I do.

You know, and since Joanie, I've, um, kind of woken up, and I care again.<eos> And it's fucking painful sometimes.<eos> You know, something has changed.<eos> I know that nothing, absolutely nothing lasts forever.<eos> And everyone... you, me, Noah... we can only control our own choices... nobody else's.<eos> We can't save each other.<eos> We can only save ourselves.<eos> I have to tell you something about the night Scott died.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I don't?
I just really needed to tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you... I guess.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> I have to take out someone's gallbladder in 32 minutes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, just go.<eos> Um, I just... I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't know how to live with this.<eos> You just do.
You got out of prison?<eos> No, out of Bloomsburg.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Fucking backwoods shithole.<eos> I got out.<eos> And you got stuck there.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you, man.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - You...<eos> - No, I don't.
She's alive. And according to her, my father made her leave that message.<eos> It was Cyrus Beene. He killed Frankie Vargas.<eos> And then my father ordered Jake to kill her.<eos> It's time for you to take what's yours, son.<eos> It's time to come home.<eos> But Jake didn't kill her.<eos> Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out.<eos> What? And you don't?
What if I had something to trade,<eos> - something you wanted? - Huck...<eos> Jennifer Fields is alive.<eos> Say that again?<eos> Jennifer Fields, the woman from the cabin...<eos> She's alive.<eos> What's the name of your inmate?<eos> Abby didn't tell me what this is about, which isn't unusual.<eos> But, I have to ask.<eos> No, you don't.
The one?<eos> The guy. Your guy.<eos> The one you plucked from relative obscurity.<eos> Left the White House for, hitched your wagon to.<eos> The one.<eos> Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
About 2 1/2 minutes.<eos> Then you need to move, Huck.<eos> He's still in the trunk?<eos> I'd like to see where you'd be.<eos> Not in the trunk, that's for sure.<eos> Please.<eos> Huck, what was she driving?<eos> Huck, don't you dare give up on me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you? !
Felix, what do you need us to do?<eos> Nothing. I don't need anything.<eos> Just... where's Helena?<eos> - She's out hunting.<eos> - Trapping.<eos> It's all categorized as hunting, Donnie.<eos> I know, but specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is dire, Donnie. He needs some ideas of a concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no. I don't, Donnie.
It alleges Julia Ayres worked with Bianchi to stage her own assassination attempt and to plan the attempted murder of NYPD officers.<eos> I guess Nate didn't trust you not to lose your nerve.<eos> No, I didn't trust myself.<eos> I gave Nate the nod.<eos> Between the two of us, he's much braver than I.<eos> Why?<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Trading it all in to become a civil servant.<eos> - At least you dress the part.<eos> - Thank you, Mother.<eos> You grew up so fast. Both of you.<eos> Lady Hamilton.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> It was a few years ago. Yes.<eos> Of course I do.
How do you know he took it?<eos> I saw him.<eos> You didn't say anything? I thought he was trying to put it back. Why would it need to go back?<eos> Huh?<eos> Audrey used it for...<eos> You motherfucker.<eos> Audrey used to to fund a real estate scheme.<eos> Yeah, and who lured her into this fucking real estate scheme?<eos> Him, because he knew that she had your money.<eos> Did you do a real estate deal with her before? Before when?
Let's have another.<eos> Let's.<eos> How the fuck do you even know what he said to them?<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know what he said.<eos> He had his story. He stuck to it.<eos> Unless he didn't.<eos> If they had anything, they would have charged him.<eos> And who knows what he would have said then?<eos> I do.
MURPHY: You're just disappointed 'cause it's not a robot.<eos> Trust me, these dogs know what they're doing.<eos> It's possible to love robots and dogs, you know. - [Murphy sighs]<eos> - You ever watch The Jetsons?<eos> The what?<eos> Okay, here's the address.<eos> Sending the location now.<eos> Squad, 1305, copy that.<eos> Who lives there?<eos> GOSS: Who doesn't, more like it.
Suspicions?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm full of suspicions.<eos> I'm suspicious of all-you-can-eat buffets.<eos> Each and every 10-K I have to read.<eos> I'm suspicious that the folks you work for... the federal government...<eos> occasionally fuck up.<eos> Hey, you get me started, I'll admit I'm suspicious that not all prize fights are on the up and up, that Warren Buffett and Bill Gates may not really like each other as much as they claim.<eos> I'm even suspicious that maybe you don't really need those glasses to see.<eos> I do.
Many times.<eos> Henry, is that juniper tree still there?<eos> You know, the one by the infirmary.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Oh, it has the softest grass.<eos> It feels delicious on your ass.<eos> I mean, we used to sneak out at night and, - oh, for hours we would...<eos> - Bigby, please.<eos> Are you telling me you don't even remember that tree?<eos> Of course I do, darling. Of course.
I'll see you at home.<eos> Three weeks.<eos> Three weeks of... stale air... bloody American baked beans.<eos> Can't stay here.<eos> We have to trust Broussard.<eos> Screw Broussard.<eos> Think he gives a shit about us?<eos> Then where the hell is he?<eos> - You know where.<eos> - No, I don't.
Plopper. Spider-Pig?<eos> ♪ Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig ♪<eos> ♪ Does whatever ♪<eos> ♪ A Spider-Pig does... ♪<eos> We've had him since you found him, but I'm the only one who takes care of him.<eos> How hard can it be to clean up after a pig?<eos> Look, I'm the only one who feeds him, cleans him, and maintains his wallow.<eos> I am grateful beyond words.<eos> I bet you didn't even know it was called a wallow.<eos> - I certainly did!
I could never love a daughter of the woman who made a cuckold out of me.<eos> You are nothing but another faceless, vermin inhabitant this festering waste-land.<eos> Cordially,<eos> Hans Steiner.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Oh, we're winning so far.<eos> There was a British agent here asking after you.<eos> Figured he'd catch up to me, eventually.<eos> The money is good, Martin, but I don't need it.<eos> Neither does Steiner.
- Really?<eos> You have a lot of experience with the verfluchte zwillingsschwester?<eos> If Bonaparte was still alive, you wouldn't be.<eos> Your mistake has cost us more than you know.<eos> No, my mistake was thinking that you knew what you were doing.<eos> Why did Nick look like daddy?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... We were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.

I couldn't imagine putting anybody's needs before my own.<eos> But you changed all that. And you changed all that for me.<eos> But listen, Monroe, I am-<eos> I am... i am scared, I am, like, heart-racing, pit in my stomach, I can't breathe type of scared because now that I have everything that I never even knew I wanted,<eos> And I can't...<eos> I will not live like this.<eos> I can't be this vulnerable all the time. I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
You know, honey, you don't always have to protect everybody.<eos> You can always come to me.<eos> But if you ever do see something when I'm not around, like... Well, for example, if... If Nick was ever to hurt mommy.<eos> He'd be very sorry.<eos> Yes, he would.<eos> My god, my god, my god!<eos> My baby.<eos> Can't tell you how grateful we are.<eos> You have no idea what this means to us.<eos> Actually, I do.
I don't see any dirt in this park.<eos> - It's all grass.<eos> - All right, so if everything is grass, how did the dirt get dug up before the kid fell in?<eos> Somebody did some digging before the kid started playing.<eos> But why would somebody start digging right where a body was buried, unless they knew the body<eos> - was buried right here?<eos> - So it's either a complete coincidence or the killer was the digger.<eos> Hey, we believe in a lot of things but not coincidence.<eos> You see any signs of a pick or a shovel?<eos> I do not.
Hair.<eos> Mm, wrong.<eos> Well, try glasses or a beard.<eos> Yeah, glasses.<eos> No!<eos> Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?<eos> - After all this? - No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
You can't do this by yourself.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Your mother had more knowledge than either of us.<eos> Yeah, and look where it got her.<eos> Did she ever mention anything to you about portals to another world?<eos> Or... moving through mirrors?<eos> Eh, no, but, I mean, there was a lot we didn't talk about.<eos> For the record, not a great mother.<eos> Do you still have any of her books?<eos> I do...
You heard Mrs. Cutler died last night.<eos> Guessing that's why you ran.<eos> - It's not what you think.<eos> - Then tell us.<eos> - I want a lawyer.<eos> - If the autopsy proves she died from anything you did to her, you will go to jail, Mason.<eos> Now we talked to Dr. Landeaux.<eos> He told us she was suffering from dementia, and she could become violent.<eos> Now your record doesn't suggest you like assaulting people.<eos> - I don't.
We don't split up.<eos> We stay together.<eos> I don't want to be rescued, Nick.<eos> I came here for a reason.<eos> You can't take on the skull thing alone.<eos> You have a son. You should be thinking of him.<eos> You're here because of me.<eos> None of this would have ever happened to you if you hadn't met me.<eos> So you think I wanna change that?<eos> - Yes, I do.

There's nothing more I can do.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Hey. Where's Eve?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
Well, in that case... .. can we have cakes by the fire?<eos> And jellies.<eos> And cream!<eos> Do you not love him?<eos> I must find a way.<eos> It's no fault of his that I struggle.<eos> What is it?<eos> This morning... .. Osborne came to me... .. demanding... .. that I... That he...<eos> But did not Dr Enys advise at least six weeks of abstinence?<eos> He did.
You know what? Um, excuse me.<eos> What happened with Gus?<eos> What happened?<eos> I gave him all the reasons why I thought it was a bad idea for us to move in together.<eos> I'm still in college.<eos> I have law school after that.<eos> It'll probably be years before I get a real job.<eos> And he broke up with you?<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
I didn't know that.<eos> When is the next bus?<eos> Check the board.<eos> There's nothing on the board.<eos> Then I guess you got your answer.<eos> You mean, there's not another bus?<eos> People lie.<eos> Board don't.<eos> You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?<eos> Sure, I do.
And I find it hard to believe that you didn't know about it the whole time.<eos> And since then, he's paid his dues.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What about me?<eos> Do you think the committee would have me break up with the man that I love just because he went to prison?<eos> What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you, I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
I tried to explain the situation to them, but...<eos> I'm sorry, Mike.<eos> They're all leaving, Donna...<eos> First Jessica and now Mike.<eos> They're family.<eos> You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
I never should have been at Pearson Specter.<eos> But not being a lawyer isn't the only reason I didn't belong there.<eos> You see, the whole reason that I wanted to be a lawyer in the first place was so that I could help the kind of people that come into this clinic every single day.<eos> Now, I thought you all knew this, but it's clear to me now that you don't.<eos> Nathan wanted to protect me, but... I'd rather have you respect me.<eos> If any of you have any questions at all, please come talk to me about it.<eos> If not, let's get back to work.<eos> Mike.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Not really.<eos> They're coming tomorrow. I've been packing, and...<eos> They're not coming.<eos> $3,600?<eos> Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The clinic has a fund to help with this kind of thing.<eos> We do it all the time.
- He has a name, you know.<eos> - I do, but I'd be shocked if you knew what it was.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - No, Harvey, the point is, I'm not doing anything to him, I'm doing it for him.<eos> - And how exactly do you figure that?<eos> - I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> - Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.<eos> - Well, I want him here now.<eos> - Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.<eos> - And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> - And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.
And I can probably get a month supply of the new chloroquine.<eos> It'll save some of us from dying in the summer when we're forced to drink sewer water.<eos> Jesus. Is that true?<eos> Would it matter if I said it was?<eos> So you're a doctor?<eos> I put myself on the vocational training lists when I was 17 years old.<eos> I'm 52 now.<eos> Still waiting for my slot.<eos> But we still gotta take care of ourselves down here.<eos> And so we do.
Eleven.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> I'm not taking you anywhere.<eos> I'm just trying to stay alive.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> I made a deal with your dad to get me my key.<eos> If I let you go, he's got no reason to do it.<eos> What if he doesn't bring it?<eos> He will.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
Queen Mother.<eos> And you must be Princess Claude.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> I'm not a virgin, either.<eos> I'm glad you're enjoying this situation.<eos> And I don't mean to make light of the circumstances.<eos> Believe me, this is all happening just as quickly for me.<eos> But I want to make this work.<eos> Plenty of arranged marriages do.<eos> And plenty don't.
This... this is a bit of a surprise.<eos> What's that?<eos> A mass...<eos> Roughly the size of a small grape.<eos> I have a grape in my brain?<eos> But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
Oh, you mean the brownouts. Four or five.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I'm trying to get back here, but my aim's off.<eos> - Okay, all right, it seems like more than your aim.<eos> - Last three worlds I've been in haven't had any fucking oxygen.<eos> My fingers just... they just... They just keep shorting me out.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did we kill the beast?<eos> - We did.
- What do you mean?<eos> - He's a great kid.<eos> And he's gonna be a great lawyer.<eos> But I had to watch him tank a case without being able to help him and a woman ended up out on the street.<eos> I thought if we do this, then I'll never to have to sit back and do nothing when someone I care about is losing ever again.<eos> Then stop worrying about what we're doing because tomorrow isn't about losing.<eos> It's about winning.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> We've been up all night and we've got nothing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I'm sorry...<eos> You see, I thought we were in this together.<eos> I wanted to be. I tried to be. But this life you want...<eos> Doesn't it feel wrong to you? No.<eos> And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.<eos> Because I'm an O'Hare, Jesse.<eos> I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right. Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?
I try to tell people all the time, but sometimes I just don't think they believe me.<eos> But you're right. I'm a greedy, selfish, destructive.<eos> You name it. Jealous. Yeah.<eos> Maybe that's the difference, though, between me and you.<eos> 'Cause you see, me, if I was in your situation? If some moppet had their hands on my girl? And I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> No. I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.<eos> I've not come here to talk you out of anything, alright?<eos> I'm only here to let you kno that whatever you decide, I'm with you, Padre.<eos> It'd be over between us, Cass.<eos> If I did it.
No, no, no, no. He didn't do anything.<eos> I thought y'all was trying to keep me safe!<eos> Get your hands off of him! He didn't do anything!<eos> Get your hands off of him! He didn't do anything.<eos> I understand, ma'am, and we're gonna find that out, aren't we?<eos> - Ricky!<eos> - Why'd you lie to me?<eos> - Ricky, I'm so sorry.<eos> - You lied!<eos> He didn't do anything!
I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who?<eos> No way.<eos> And have you bring them here and spin them around like me?<eos> No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
- All right. Cover the sides and rear.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> I'm sorry, Officers, but unless you're here to pray, you can't come inside.<eos> Okay, Father...<eos> I have witnesses saw two men go inside your church that are suspects in a rape and murder.<eos> We'll be very respectful, but we need to go in and get 'em.<eos> First of all, they're not men.<eos> They're boys.<eos> And they now have sanctuary inside this church.<eos> - Like hell they do.
"The Prince will arrive first at the meeting point..."<eos> Very best of luck with that! Stop it!<eos> Oh, please!<eos> As if you've ever been early to anything in your life!<eos> Blah-blah-blah, protocol, protocol, protocol!<eos> "...with the introductions effected by the two retinues, "at which point, the Princess and the Prince..."<eos> That should be the other way round, surely? "..<eos> Will strip to the waist and wrestle in the filth "and detritus of the forest floor." It doesn't say that.<eos> Um...<eos> No, it doesn't! What about the end?
She is a member of the nobility.<eos> Treat her as you would any other murderer.<eos> Over there, Sire!<eos> Between the trees!<eos> I see nothing.<eos> A wild boar, 200 pounds A made game, I say.<eos> It would be a trifle dangerous.<eos> Where did you acquire these poisons?<eos> I want to...<eos> Where did you...
I am... dead inside.<eos> Manuel Alberto Delgado.<eos> Bravo, Manny! Baby!<eos> - Mwah! - You did it, buddy!<eos> Lucas Phillip Dunphy.<eos> Yeah! - Whoo! - My baby, my baby!<eos> Well done, son.<eos> Remember how cute he was in his little Buzz Lightyear costume?<eos> Or how he used to say "burfday" and "Li-bary"?<eos> He still does.
Son of a bitch! I need this damn thing out!<eos> Mr. Koslow, please, you need to calm down.<eos> And you need to take this out of my arm.<eos> I'm two pounds over.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> It's just water weight. That iv is the only reason you're feeling stronger.<eos> You need to leave it in. You know, screw this.<eos> You're not gonna do it,<eos> - I'll pull it out myself.<eos> - Whoa! No, no, no. Please don't do that.
I know, nat, and I feel terrible.<eos> And I... and I heard what he said about dating.<eos> No, jeff.<eos> I can handle that.<eos> I'm just really sorry.<eos> It should be me apologizing to you. Why?<eos> I'm the one who made everything worse.<eos> I haven't been fair to you.<eos> Stohl also said that he hoped we all learned something today.<eos> And I did.
So we can't hold her?<eos> Not if she wants to go.<eos> Totally her call.<eos> Figured.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, it used to be if a doctor told a patient to do something, they just did it.<eos> You been binging on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" again?<eos> I'm just saying, things were different.<eos> Like, guys didn't need to tell women every single thing they were feeling.<eos> My father never did.
It's for Mr. Kessler, the man who saved your son.<eos> They need to operate on him immediately.<eos> But it was promised to us!<eos> We've been waiting for it.<eos> Plus that man would want Dustin to have it.<eos> There can't be a bigger emergency than this.<eos> My son is dying.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and do nothing?<eos> Mrs. Banks, Dustin still has options, other ways of continuing to warm.<eos> Mr. Kessler does not.
We both know that's not true, Leopold.<eos> I took the base offline.<eos> You're no longer in the system.<eos> There's nowhere for you to go.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is. - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
You?<eos> You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?<eos> The foster homes, bouncing around.<eos> I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.<eos> Only the places I wanted to stay.<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.<eos> And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do, don't you?
Who cares?<eos> Phil... we are who we are.<eos> - Flaws and all.<eos> - And you're fine with that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am. [Music] Fitz!<eos> Oh, Fitz, this has all been a big misunderstanding.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> - Things just got out of control.<eos> - Yeah, they did.
Oh, boy.<eos> Please tell me one of you speaks English.<eos> Da.<eos> Well, that's not really...<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm with the u.N. Taskforce here.<eos> Some biohazardous materials were unearthed on this site.<eos> Really dangerous stuff.<eos> You have paper?<eos> I do, indeed, yes.
Whereas I still have my mind but know exactly what I am.<eos> And more importantly, I understand a basic truth that you don't realize yet.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That our bodies don't matter.<eos> Radcliffe built a world ... a world exactly like this one.<eos> Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do. And you?
Well, you, Doctor, exhibit poor self-control, and if you someday come to regret building the Framework, you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it.<eos> Why would you think I would ever do that?<eos> I am saving these people.<eos> I am giving them a replica of their life - with less pain.<eos> - Yes. But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it! Ward, look at me.<eos> I have never betrayed you, ever.<eos> We're real.<eos> Is she your source for the Resistance?<eos> - No!<eos> - No! Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here! Unh!<eos> Well, I do.
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.<eos> A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.<eos> Really?<eos> I want any and all assets in the area on this.<eos> Hydra is after you.<eos> We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
Someone else tried that today.<eos> Maybe you heard him just now, learning his lesson.<eos> So, I re-ran your test results.<eos> Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman.<eos> Go on. Guess.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> No matter. We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Please tell me that you built a back door to this place.<eos> - I did.
I will...<eos> My baby.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I don't see Mack.<eos> He's gone.<eos> That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> - I do.
- Yeah, man. - Yeah, it looked great.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> My deal just closed.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It would've been nice to have your support when Kyle drew his line in the sand.<eos> I didn't agree with your take on it.<eos> Besides, Adam should've come to me. I'm the producer.<eos> I really don't think he makes the distinction.<eos> Of course he does.
Stick to your job.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Cardinal is waiting for me.<eos> Good, you can,<eos> I don't know, talk to him.<eos> Make him your pal, Delorme.<eos> Open him.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Hey. Yes. Do you understand how big this is?<eos> I do.
Eyes.<eos> Come on. Just keep walking.<eos> How old is your daughter?<eos> Eight.<eos> She'd be eight.<eos> My wife and I had a son.<eos> Oliver.<eos> He's almost five.<eos> They had Canadian passports.<eos> I didn't.
But that doesn't mean it's bad.<eos> If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.<eos> Don't explain. Just apologize.<eos> They love to be forgiving.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
- Who are you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I know that you're officially a headhunter, but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients at places like this.<eos> I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
So you can say no if you want to, but don't say I haven't changed.<eos> Because the Mike you met that night in prison never would have told you the truth just now.<eos> Julius, please.<eos> I need this.<eos> This is the address.<eos> It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
- In the bullpen.<eos> What is it now, Harvey?<eos> You want to put the janitor in charge of bankruptcy?<eos> Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.<eos> I'm sorry too, Harvey.<eos> Jessica, you don't need to apologize.<eos> Yes, I do.
You will be killed.<eos> No!<eos> Sir!<eos> No!<eos> Julia.<eos> That bridge is fifty feet high.<eos> The water was shallow.<eos> There were rocks.<eos> I barely survived the jump myself.<eos> Yes, but you did.
- Would that be definitive?<eos> - Not definitive, no, but possibly convincing, one way or the other.<eos> - If this isn't Gillies...<eos> - Then he is alive and he will kill us.<eos> Look.<eos> Remember when Constable Crabtree shot him?<eos> We never did take out the bullet.<eos> - The bullets match.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
This is how we get by.<eos> Food's ready.<eos> Grab my paper for me.<eos> What is it?<eos> We hit the goddamn jackpot.<eos> Bradley, don't send that video yet.<eos> She wasn't kidnapped by Inazagi.<eos> They realize who she is, that's who they'll sell her to.<eos> She has no corporate I.P.<eos> But you do.
Do you really wanna be holding on to it when it breaks.<eos> If the outcome of this inquiry were to reflect poorly on her, a better position could come your way.<eos> You'd oversee security across all of North America.<eos> More power, more authority.<eos> You'd never have to set foot in the Quiet Room again.<eos> I have to get back to work, sir.<eos> You got a gut feeling about who did this?<eos> I have someone in mind.<eos> Hey, didn't hear you come home last night.<eos> I didn't.
It's freezing, dummy.<eos> Too many eyes and ears before.<eos> You said you wanted to help?<eos> They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> What?<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Find Rachel at the bar.<eos> Wait. How do they know I was there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just do.
I had my own room.<eos> What?<eos> I just like to see you squirm.<eos> Look, we came all this way for him.<eos> Just tell me what Dolls is.<eos> He's what Black Badge made him.<eos> Though they lied to him about that, too.<eos> That's why I was in Purgatory.<eos> I was trying to help him find out what he... we are.<eos> What they did to us.
- Dolls, you need to go!<eos> - OK. Dolls, go!<eos> - We got 'em!<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Damn, I do feel naked without it.<eos> - Hold... still!<eos> - How do we get out?<eos> - We go down!<eos> - What about me, what do I do?
One of your coppers must have planted it.<eos> You're on thin ice.<eos> Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.<eos> None of that is mine.<eos> I'd like to speak to my solicitor.<eos> Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.<eos> Fucking Eddie.<eos> I ain't seen him.<eos> How did you afford a place there, then?<eos> I didn't.
- Maybe this is my chance.<eos> - No.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> The spirits are getting stronger.<eos> There's an object that's calling to 'em.<eos> There.<eos> - Those were hers.<eos> - Man, what the fuck?<eos> - How you know that?<eos> - Just do.
Whatever the Legion's done to Rip, we gotta get him back.<eos> Jax, I'm putting you in charge.<eos> Well... me?<eos> But, I...<eos> You got this.<eos> Sara! Grey, do something.<eos> - She's still alive.<eos> I'll try to stabilize her, but we need Gideon.<eos> I don't know how to be a Captain, man.<eos> Yes, you do, Jefferson.
I couldn't resist.<eos> Though I prefer the term "borrowed."<eos> Impressive.<eos> There's hope for you yet.<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, the stories you grew up on are just that.<eos> They're stories, all right?<eos> The Medieval world was a time of turmoil.<eos> It was the collapse of Rome, which led to the collapse of civilization itself.<eos> And don't even get me started on the health and sanitation.<eos> - Yeah, please don't.
Hey, what?<eos> What is it?<eos> Cadmus has the list of all the aliens in the country.<eos> Well, what do we do?<eos> We get up.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> Excellent work, Jeremiah.<eos> I know it wasn't easy.<eos> We have a deal, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
- You too, Maggie.<eos> - Oh... Just doing what you taught me to do.<eos> You survived.<eos> Oh, you do not get to talk to her.<eos> What are you going to do to him?<eos> My job.<eos> Protect the identity of Supergirl and the DEO.<eos> - You're gonna mind-wipe him?<eos> - Do you object?<eos> No. Just... Before you do...
Okay, go.<eos> Why won't it shut down?<eos> - What did you do? - What I had to do.<eos> For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?
Well look, I do have some hours if this is something you're interested in.<eos> You comfortable with a plow rig?<eos> You know, got a steering wheel, I can drive it.<eos> And you're okay with the early mornings?<eos> If I haven't smoked too much meth the night before.<eos> Woody, look,<eos> I know you got it in your head that... I don't know...<eos> I may not think highly of you, but I'm telling you this, I just want to help my sister.<eos> Now do you want this or not?<eos> I do.
- I have the right to see him!<eos> - Oh, don't be so stupid of<eos> - course youâre not going!<eos> - Why? Because he's gonna look like a burnt piece...<eos> - ... of meat, that's why. - Christos! Stop it.<eos> Both of you.<eos> When you told her, what did she say?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> She didn't want to believe it.<eos> None of us do.
Unconscious.<eos> Sheâs in hospital.<eos> Do you have any idea who she might be?<eos> She was undressed.<eos> An escort, you think?<eos> How long have you been married?<eos> A year.<eos> Not long enough I think for him to be scouting a younger version.<eos> I understand your grief.<eos> No, you do not.
I never went to the cellar.<eos> Can you show me?<eos> You can't use the house code, Madame.<eos> The safe code has eight digits.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> Forgive me, Madame, I can't tell you.<eos> Cannot or will not?<eos> Cannot.<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Well, who does?
Why is her mask off?<eos> We need<eos> - as much venom as we can get.<eos> - She needed a break. She'll live.<eos> If we don't get enough venom to make more of the cure, my brothers won't be so fortunate.<eos> Do what you need to do.<eos> I can'n'breathe in here.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Mom said you like to paint, too.<eos> I do.
Mom said he was a witch.<eos> That he came to help me feel better.<eos> But I feel worse.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> But don't worry, because as we speak, your mother and your Uncle Elijah are working with Vincent to fix you up.<eos> So you just stay calm and they'll make everything all right.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.
If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Meeting an expert shortly.<eos> He'll be coming by way of Mystic Falls, carrying one of the bones and the means to find another.<eos> Between the three of us, we should have those remains by sundown.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> For that matter, why would you trust me?<eos> I don't.
Almost got that done, didn't I?<eos> Why do I have this feeling we both know that you'd be better off dead?<eos> Well?<eos> The jawbone was Hanson Sr.'s... but I guarantee you, if the rest of that ooze could take shape... you'd find Bruce Liddell in there, too.<eos> And you're transferring to Missouri?<eos> That's where Martin Byrde is.<eos> Alive and well, swiping his Amex.<eos> How are we gonna do this?<eos> Byrde liquidates his business.<eos> Somebody does the same to Bruce.
To Reese and Hera.<eos> May your days be blessed with peace.<eos> And your nights with lust!<eos> I also want to thank you, all of you, for welcoming me back into your grace.<eos> These past few months have been the happiest I can remember in a very long time.<eos> You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you...<eos> The gods did.
Is someone there?<eos> I can hear you breathing.<eos> Why are you Scottish?<eos> - I'm not Scottish, I'm just cross.<eos> - Is there Scotland in space?<eos> They're all over the place, demanding independence from every planet they land on. Why are you here?<eos> Because I figured out why you keep your box as a phone box.<eos> I told you, it's stuck.<eos> "Advice and Assistance Obtainable Immediately." You like that.<eos> No, I don't.
You didn't come up here for a tip on a race?<eos> You heard anything about a new casino coming to upstate New York?<eos> Whispers, yeah.<eos> I heard whispers.<eos> It's important I find out where exactly it's going.<eos> The town's unclear.<eos> But I did hear this big casino guy,<eos> Donald Thayer, he's getting ready to get busy building upstate.<eos> I know Thayer.<eos> Mm. 'Course you do.
Changes what I can pitch.<eos> By design.<eos> Well, you may have solved one problem, but you made the crucial one much harder to solve.<eos> So you got nothing.<eos> No, I have just what you need.<eos> But apparently, I can't give it to you.<eos> You're allowed, you know.<eos> You are not an algorithm, you are not a machine, you're human.<eos> You are allowed to have a down quarter.<eos> All hedge funds do, eventually.
Mr. Watley, hold up, please.<eos> I have a meeting... very important.<eos> Uh, I'll make myself available to you first opening in my Filofax.<eos> I've seen your calendar.<eos> Make an opening.<eos> Or I will.<eos> Deb, you found Wags?<eos> No.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> - You do?
Remember, I told you.<eos> Mommy and Daddy are spending some time apart for awhile.<eos> So, I'm home now, and Mommy will be home tonight.<eos> Mom doesn't even want to come home.<eos> That is not true, Kevin.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't ever want to hear you say that again.<eos> It's Daddy's fault that Mommy and Daddy aren't together right now.<eos> When you're a kid your age, you think that your parents know everything.<eos> But we don't.
Yeah, I imagine it did.<eos> You know, for the longest time, I couldn't synthesize it.<eos> How that story came out in the paper, how there was just enough in that article to bait the U.S. Attorney's Office.<eos> Yeah, it was a bad beat, no doubt.<eos> Well, since then, I've had a lot of time to just sit and think, and slowly, it dawned...<eos> If I lost, someone else must've gained.<eos> So I ran a thousand simulations a day in my head.<eos> And over and over again, Bobby, it came back the same.<eos> I was your stalking horse.<eos> You did the transaction.
Okay.<eos> Couple ways this can go...<eos> We do, like, intense psychotherapy for two years, five days a week, break down your walls, push past your rationalizations and defenses.<eos> Or you can tell me what the fuck is going on.<eos> How?<eos> Isn't the point of analysis that we don't know?<eos> Which is why I'm not in that racket.<eos> We don't have that kind of fucking time.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Fucking right we don't.
Did he talk about himself at all?<eos> Not much.<eos> I tend to go on a bit when I'm talking about my dad.<eos> He didn't mention anything that was troubling him, you know, in passing?<eos> Anything?<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't say. Sorry.<eos> Only it's our understanding that he was the victim of a violent assault during the two days we're talking about.<eos> And you'd think it'd be something that might come up.<eos> It honestly didn't.
His company's got a finger in every pie.<eos> Tax law, company law, patents, overseas investments, you name it.<eos> Ah, Mr Marston.<eos> I'm in a bit of a hurry.<eos> You didn't tell us you were at the Law Faculty party the night Jamie died.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm still involved with the university.<eos> It's where I studied.<eos> But we appealed for all the party guests to come forward.<eos> - You didn't.
They had to make him better, so they could make him worse.<eos> Just like you.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> In Amber's bedroom, your eyes were open.<eos> Pink lampshade, princesses and ponies.<eos> You were awake before he put you to sleep again.<eos> Your husband, while your hands were around your little girl's throat.<eos> You should have seen him.<eos> The shape that boy was in, he couldn't have left here on his own.<eos> He didn't.
They say you have impeccable luck, Mr. Parker.<eos> Everything you touch seems to turn to gold.<eos> I've only ever gotten lucky once... the day I was born with my instincts.<eos> If I can trust those, I almost never lose.<eos> I'm told you're the same.<eos> You didn't luck into being born a Royal.<eos> You were born with killer instincts, and that's why I wanted to meet you... Your Majesty.<eos> What did baby do?<eos> Baby made a mess.<eos> Yes, he most certainly did.
There is one way.<eos> Blaine.<eos> But I doubt he'll take the risk.<eos> He doesn't trust us.<eos> But he trusts Peyton. I could get her to ask him to hear us out.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Listen to me. They're the ones that can't even get on nasdaq.<eos> Off the phone, please, Mr. Davis.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- My eyes are wide open.<eos> Why are you being such a dick?<eos> It isn't obvious?<eos> It's because I'm in love with you.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Shoot me up, doc.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> Do it.
Oh, you poor thing.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> They said... I'm crazy.<eos> You wanna know what I think, Suzanne?<eos> I think crazy is just a word people invented to keep the extra-interesting people down.<eos> Well, Mommy says there are many shades of different as there are of people.<eos> Well, I wish I was told that when I was growing up.<eos> Are those my meds?<eos> You don't need these anymore, Suzanne.<eos> No, actually... I do.
-Yeah. I, uh... think he's okay.<eos> Look, he even smiling'.<eos> Wait...<eos> I think I hear him breathing' again.<eos> He just needed some air, right?<eos> - Nice job, Suzanne.<eos> Here, let me...<eos> let me...<eos> Okay. Let's just U-turn this and go to Medical, okay?<eos> Do a three-point turn, maybe, all right?
I'm gonna go to the pharmacy. I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.<eos> - For me?<eos> Please, don't do your thing right now.<eos> Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
There is a reason why those Spanish ladies, they call me loco in the coco.<eos> I'm trying so hard not to be like that.<eos> But it's like, uh, what Dr. Oz says about insanity.<eos> When you do the same thing over, over, over, over again, expecting different results.<eos> Well, I think it was actually Einstein, but proceed.<eos> See, they look positive to me.<eos> I mean, I know some of the lines is blurrier than the others, but I think I'm so fucking crazy, I'm seeing shit now.<eos> Babe... you're actually pregnant.<eos> I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.
- I don't think it's the coffee.<eos> I think it's, like, what happens to your intestines when you fuck up real bad.<eos> Stress does hit me in the gut.<eos> Maybe we should have stayed out of this whole thing.<eos> Sat out in the yard, getting sun or some shit.<eos> No.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> We did what we believed in.<eos> Ain't no one can take that from us.<eos> Except they did.
So we will have to.<eos> So is it true?<eos> About your son's surgery?<eos> Will he be okay?<eos> They're doing this thing called trepanation.<eos> My aunt tried to explain it, but I don't think she understands it, either.<eos> I know trepanation.<eos> They basically... lift the upper flap of your scalp and drill a hole under your skull to release pressure on the brain.<eos> You making this shit up right now?<eos> Uh, my... my roommate, freshman year, uh, he did it for enlightenment.
This is all that's left of my people.<eos> Can you save them?<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Tell me something good.<eos> Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Alie said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
We just want the tech. No one has to get hurt.<eos> No.<eos> Give me the pack. No.<eos> No. Let go.<eos> Give that back.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please. That's not tech.<eos> That's the spirit of the commanders. Please.<eos> Ilian, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
I've seen that once or twice.<eos> Yeah, you have.<eos> You know, I was always scared to have kids.<eos> I didn't know anything about it, you know?<eos> How to take care of them when they come home crying, how to keep them safe.<eos> You know I never saw what that looked like.<eos> I am going to be a great dad some day because of you, and that's a hell of a gift.<eos> So... you got a gift too?<eos> You're... you want to transfer?<eos> I don't.
Like it or not, this is the biggest story in New York.<eos> Hell, it's even gone national.<eos> Either you address the media tonight or you address them on your front stoop tomorrow.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Hey, I got a call my brother was here.<eos> - Wallace Tufo?<eos> - You're the NYPD officer?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> How bad is he?<eos> Who did this?
How you doing?<eos> There are, like, a dozen staff members outside, all dying to buy you a beer, and you're stuck in your cave - with your worried face.<eos> - Yeah. Goodness.<eos> You are the worst at celebrating.<eos> Uh, well, listen, we gotta recarpet the rooms, and I've already placed the order, so I'm just waiting to hear if we can, uh, take delivery next week.<eos> We're fully booked next week.<eos> We've got three open suites, so I was just gonna rotate guests as they come, and we'll do the regular rooms first, then we'll do the cabins afterwards.<eos> Why don't we just wait till the off-season?<eos> Better to do it now. 'Cause they upcharge in the off-season.<eos> Everybody does their renovations then.
If I'm being honest.<eos> No, if I make you feel so shitty, just go. - No.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm the reason.<eos> If I'm the reason, then...<eos> 'Cause that doesn't feel right either.<eos> I don't know what's right.<eos> My best friend in the world does crazy shit and doesn't trust me and doesn't listen to me.<eos> It is not that simple, and you know it.<eos> I don't...
I never asked.<eos> Do you have any good memories of my dad?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I thought so.<eos> I told you a story about us swimming.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> My dad... the way he taught Danny was he took him out in the middle of the ocean and he threw him overboard.<eos> He expected him to swim.<eos> And he did.
I will untangle this war shit somehow.<eos> I know the high king has the power, but I will hunt ember to the ends of the world to have that stupid rule rewritten.<eos> Everything El promised, I'm gonna deliver.<eos> You hear me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
I denied it when asked.<eos> Okay.<eos> You've lodged official protest of my statement.<eos> Say what you came to say.<eos> You're alive as long as you're making progress.<eos> But the AG thinks that you stalled, she's gonna show you the Hans Gruber Memorial Exit.<eos> Well, it's nice to hear you take the potential demise of my career so seriously.<eos> Laugh or cry.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I sure do.
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.<eos> You can do it harder.<eos> Even harder than that.<eos> There's no coming back from this.<eos> Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.<eos> If we fail, it's on both of us.<eos> I won't be able to protect you.<eos> And what a relief that will be... for both of us.<eos> The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.
Won't all this be a PR nightmare?<eos> PR that comes with losing that much money is a nightmare, too.<eos> And we lose the money.<eos> I don't like any of the answers I'm hearing.<eos> There has to be a way to get this done without destroying the place.<eos> Model it up for me.<eos> All scenarios.<eos> Son, I did something today that is gonna absolutely floor you.<eos> I thought you went golfing today.<eos> I did.
Which is a dismal car.<eos> BMW have the X4, I think that's called.<eos> Don't want one of those, either.<eos> Mercedes have this horrible monster.<eos> They're all just rubbish.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You have a solution.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Yes, I do.
I've lost you!<eos> Race mode.<eos> Here we go.<eos> In race mode, everything is in a tensed-up state:<eos> The throttle response, the gearbox, the steering.<eos> And the traction control is off!<eos> This has now been transformed from something that was brilliant... into something that is sensational.<eos> Of course, you'd never drive in race mode on the road, in the same way you'd never take your wristwatch into space.<eos> But it's nice to know that it would still work if you did.<eos> And this does.
I don't want to look at that now.<eos> No, exactly.<eos> Or the Dodge Dart.<eos> Well, what child's gonna say, "Daddy!"<eos> Daddy, let's go and look at the 40-year-old Dart in the museum"?<eos> Nobody is!<eos> It's true that car design has become so dreary lately.<eos> And I think part of it, it's almost as if the people who design cars don't actually like cars that much.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But they did then.
- No.<eos> - What?<eos> - The cars are not anchored.<eos> Because when I got there, your drifting, stupid, orange biscuit-tin boat yanked me back off it!<eos> We don't have an afternoon to just throw away while you go paddling.<eos> You're saying...<eos> I'm gonna have to do it, aren't I?<eos> Soon, James Bond was ready to go in the water.<eos> - Do I look like Roger Moore?<eos> - Yeah, you do.

Yeah.
Hell, I don't know whether to drive this thing or use it for a spit-cup.<eos> Charming!<eos> Nerds will note these conditions would be better suited to a barchetta.<eos> If you like this car, I bet you got a lot of fancy cushions in your house.<eos> Yeah, cos as we know, cushions are, of course, communist.<eos> Right, into the tight complex of old lady's house.<eos> Keeping it nice and tidy through there.<eos> And now full power for the lumpy, bumpy sprint down to substation.<eos> Front hazards coming on under hard braking.<eos> All flats do that for some reason.
Oh!<eos> There's obviously been a catastrophic failure with the submarine.<eos> - No idea what could have caused it.<eos> - The monster's bitten it!<eos> For the hundredth time, Hammond, there is no such thing as the Loch Ness Monster.<eos> - Does that mean he's not coming on, then?<eos> Well, James, his lungs have filled with icy water, he's sunk to the bottom, and his body is being compressed to the size of a Ping-Pong ball.<eos> So that is a no.<eos> It's OK, though, because we have a back-up plan.<eos> - Do we?
- Yeah, this time a bad one.<eos> - Okay, tell me about it.<eos> - He's just always on my case about everything.<eos> And he started drinking heavily again.<eos> - He didn't hit you again?<eos> - No, not this time.<eos> But he was mad enough that he could have.<eos> I wish he were dead.<eos> - You don't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
The Nine starting fresh in some remote corner of the J, like your ancestors planned.<eos> That's why you don't give a shit about the Hullen returning.<eos> 'Cause you don't plan to be here when they do.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> And that's why you tried buying a Tolerance from the Scarbacks.<eos> So you can abandon the Quad with a clear conscience.<eos> Okay, you do understand.<eos> You're right about one thing, Kalla.<eos> Your ancestors had no good choices.<eos> But you do.
You promised to protect them.<eos> Trial is forfeit.<eos> It's not our problem anymore.<eos> Oh, I'm about to give your ass one.<eos> I want you to listen real close, lover boy.<eos> Skipping out on you?<eos> Real dick move and I'm sorry for it..<eos> Very, very sorry.<eos> - I don't care anymore.<eos> But I did.
We did it for One.<eos> Jace Corso wasn't a member of this crew.<eos> He wasn't one of us.<eos> Four was.<eos> Aw, hell, that just makes it worse.<eos> Going after the drive, I get.<eos> But putting our lives on the line to settle a score?<eos> So what're you saying?<eos> We just let him get away with it?<eos> He already did.
I doublechecked the system.<eos> Seems fine.<eos> I found something.<eos> This is a magnified image of the nearest star, approximately half a lightyear away.<eos> Mass and spectrographic analysis show it to be an exact match for Pollux.<eos> - We were just in the Pollux system.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> So we just traveled half a lightyear?<eos> That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> Maybe it does.
I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.<eos> - The needle was poisoned as we suspected.<eos> One scratch, and you would've died within hours.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.<eos> This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.<eos> Discontent is growing.<eos> Teku is overreacting.<eos> You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.<eos> I do.
Yeah, damn right it's over.<eos> Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.<eos> - No.<eos> - What was that?<eos> He said no.<eos> Drop your weapons.<eos> - And then what?<eos> - I meant what I said.<eos> Please don't make me a liar.<eos> Do it. Do it.
Is there something Liam's security detail<eos> - can help you with? - Don't be like that.<eos> I've been trying to apologize about earlier with Robby.<eos> I just wanted to see how the call went.<eos> Oh, I know. That's so sweet.<eos> I panicked. I didn't have time to decide how to tell him about us.<eos> But I've thought about it, and I spoke to Liam, and I'll just tell him straight away.<eos> I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, what do I do?
♪♪<eos> Hey, Sophie, it's me Car... ah!<eos> I fall for her... [mimics Sophie] "Hello, this is Sophie"<eos> outgoing message every time.<eos> We need them to send that money.<eos> Hi, Sophie, it's... [screams]<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?<eos> Yes, but you got to wait in line with the other kids.<eos> No, you don't, buddy.
You sound like a fucking hippie.<eos> I know that this is difficult to grasp, but the age of the kingmaker is past.<eos> I don't need a power broker. I have my own power.<eos> And when it is made manifest,<eos> Foley will zip his fucking pants up and look me in the eye.<eos> Foley won't talk to you.<eos> He won't even talk to me.<eos> Does that seem like the behavior of a man whose acts were unintentional? No.<eos> But it doesn't mean you have to engage.<eos> Sure it does.
That first question you asked.<eos> Are your feelings about Mafee helpful?<eos> More than any stock you'll ever champion, more than any time you'll impress somebody by being right.<eos> You haven't noticed yet. By the time anyone notices, it's usually too late, but that place has a way of obscuring, corroding, eating you from the fucking inside.<eos> And you have a rare chance to survive.<eos> You're so far ahead of where Axe and I were when we were your age.<eos> We hadn't made hard choices. You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget. I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
He's demanding that I pull you out of there.<eos> I have to write him back.<eos> If he learns I'm in camp, he'll send for me. Or come for me.<eos> And I won't be able to help with the ring.<eos> Selah's my friend, I don't want to have to lie to him.<eos> If you write that I'm safe, and don't wish to risk more than that in a letter, it won't be a lie.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I'm more worried about Abe.<eos> I know Washington wants him to stay where he is, and you have to follow orders,<eos> - but Abe doesn't.
I'm the commander of his Majesty's Queen's Rangers.<eos> I see that.<eos> No militia.<eos> Provincial forces, not militia.<eos> Sorry, sir, only commissioned officers or sponsored guests.<eos> The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
It's all guesswork.<eos> Informants, tipsters, cheats.<eos> "Tallmadge."<eos> These are Tallmadge's dogs.<eos> "723 man in New York.<eos> 722 man on Long Island.<eos> 725 whaleboat courier."<eos> Whaleboat.<eos> I know who his courier is.<eos> You do?
Here.<eos> How the hell'd you get here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Tell it.<eos> Tell me, then i'll tell you how I tried to find you<eos> And almost got goddamn eaten, how we all almost died Because you took the truck and the hotel was overrun.<eos> Alicia, I thought it was safe.<eos> We checked every room. Nowhere is safe. Sorry.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I almost died after that.<eos> It doesn't.
I lost him the minute I lost her.<eos> How do people get through the loss?<eos> How are you getting over Benedict?<eos> Did you know that the trails that airplanes leave in the sky contain biohazardous toxic waste from hospitals?<eos> So many horrible things in the world.<eos> Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yeah?<eos> Did he give it to you, too?<eos> He always seemed a little light in his shoes.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> They are more of a family to me than you ever were.<eos> Not that that's hard with a psycho like you.<eos> You know Mom was afraid of you, right?<eos> She was afraid of you.<eos> She thought she loved you, I'm sure.<eos> She didn't.
If I stole candy for them, they would let me stay.<eos> The germans won't take it today.<eos> Not today.<eos> Where's the school?<eos> This way.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a warning.<eos> The germans must already be there.<eos> They were supposed to come by train.<eos> They didn't.
Well, we should find that out when I meet whoever sent this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Okay.<eos> We got anything?<eos> Well, witnesses place Mia in the front carriage, but her suitcase and guitar were found in the back, along with her phone.<eos> Well, no teenager leaves her phone.<eos> How could she get off a moving train?<eos> When the stain stops moving, I guess, right?<eos> But then the station CCTV would've shown her getting off the platform. Right.<eos> Unless she didn't.
- Mm.<eos> - and they're all young.<eos> So, there it is... an island.<eos> Impossible to approach without being detected.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Saunders.<eos> We need a negotiator.<eos> He can be here in 45 minutes.<eos> Eric said I should take the lead on this.<eos> He did?
You drove all the way to New York?<eos> Where?<eos> Who's he with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A woman. Older.<eos> I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes. Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
The gods have had their sacrifice and the brothers have tonight begun that which cannot be stopped.<eos> Lundene's streets are red... with Saxon blood.<eos> You are to be King.<eos> King of Mercia. King of Saxon and Dane.<eos> King of other Kings.<eos> You. Lord Uhtred.<eos> Bury him.<eos> Lord King? It is done.<eos> What we have just witnessed... do you believe it to be true?<eos> I do.
For strength.<eos> Out.<eos> You have the palest of skin.<eos> Unblemished.<eos> My touch offends you?<eos> No, it was a surprise, lord, nothing more than that.<eos> Lord, love should be gentle and kind.<eos> "Gentle and kind," she says.<eos> How is it that you have a knowledge of how love should be?<eos> I do not.
- Like hell you do.<eos> I was cast out of my clan as an infant because of this.<eos> I was forced to steal to survive.<eos> Forced to kill.<eos> You were loved.<eos> Told you were special.<eos> I was thrown away like someone's garbage.<eos> You know nothing of my pain.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Officer Jukes, I'm with the Interpol... Serious Financial Crime Agency.<eos> Monseur Clios had a safe room installed.<eos> The safe code has 8 digits.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know that.<eos> Well, who does?
These here drugs.<eos> Did Mia ever take these?<eos> Mia never touched drugs.<eos> Yes, she liked a bit of a drink, but that was it.<eos> Mark, Mia's postmortem results.<eos> What does the tox screen tell us?<eos> Er, traces of alcohol.<eos> Nothing else found in her bloodstream.<eos> That conflicts with the account we got from Meryl Fairchild.<eos> Aye, it does.
It wasn't consistent with the rate of tissue decomposition.<eos> Maybe her body had been stored somewhere cold.<eos> - Dead five weeks?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Well, that means she couldn't have sent those texts to her brother.<eos> And if she didn't send them... .. well, who did?<eos> I take it you did go home last night?<eos> Mia was killed five weeks ago.<eos> So she didn't send those texts to Jason.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Excuse me, but we're gonna<eos> - need to borrow your daughter.<eos> - Just for the day.<eos> But don't worry, we brought everything she's gonna need. - Yeah.<eos> Some goggles...<eos> - A poncho...<eos> - And some colourful socks!<eos> - Why? Hey, you didn't have any plans today, did you?<eos> No, no, I guess not.<eos> - Good, because we do.
So how can we expect the recipient of this document to trust that this was actually signed by Janice McDermott?<eos> Trust is the basis of everything that happens at this institution.<eos> That was so great.<eos> Well, thank you, Margaret.<eos> It was lovely meeting you.<eos> Oh, well, thank you for coming.<eos> It was a nice distraction.<eos> Oh, Mrs. J.<eos> She has no idea who her daughter is.<eos> After two-plus hours in there, neither do we.
I've been told to report that all the refugees have been confined to their quarters until The Widow returns.<eos> Odessa, I hardly recognized you.<eos> Doll to butterfly.<eos> Hardly recognize myself.<eos> It's quite a metamorphosis from the oil refinery.<eos> You should get back to the courtyard.<eos> Training's about to begin.<eos> Actually, I thought you could train me.<eos> I'm Regent now.<eos> I don't do that anymore.
My daughter just busted out of boarding school.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> A little birdie told me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe he said that.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Okay, okay, okay... Tonight Melanie's, then a secret rave maûana, followed by dancing at...<eos> It's my dad.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> Don't.
Stop it!<eos> Ryan, I want to go.<eos> There's nothing left for me here.<eos> If you really care for me, let me.<eos> No.<eos> Michelle...<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I know what my dad does, Maxine.<eos> I don't need to be at some boring speech.<eos> This one you do.
- What do you think I'm doing?<eos> Push her harder.<eos> Here, take this.<eos> I was happy before you came into my life... do you know that?<eos> I had my work, my life... and then you ruined everything!<eos> That's not true.<eos> You don't feel that way.<eos> You can't feel that way!<eos> Twenty-three percent.<eos> I do, Kirsten.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.<eos> Well, it worked, didn't it?<eos> It got me to bounce.<eos> Well, but at what cost? Hmm?<eos> How will you remember your mother now?<eos> How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
It looks like they have a bioweapon.<eos> - Everyone back!<eos> - Just relax!<eos> Everyone, just relax. It's not a weapon. It's a human heart.<eos> This is the man who tortured me at the black site.<eos> Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
Looks like we gotta cut this lesson short, Prospect.<eos> It's so hard to find people you can trust these days.<eos> Am I right?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to save the mission.<eos> Well, you went a little off-book.<eos> I had a memory, I improvised.<eos> You mean "went rogue."<eos> - You could have gotten Jane killed.<eos> - He didn't.
I should go.<eos> Thank you for...<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> You're not bothering me.<eos> I'm sorry about Kat.<eos> I lied.<eos> When I told her I loved her. What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
I wanted to know why she left Zero Division.<eos> Look, that file doesn't tell the whole story.<eos> It says that she was there... when Sandstorm infiltrated your group.<eos> And that she voiced concerns about the team member that later turned out to be compromised.<eos> But no one listened to her.<eos> I didn't listen.<eos> Because you were too close to the mole?<eos> How did you get over it?<eos> That feeling of... being betrayed.<eos> I... I didn't.
Baby, do you want your own birthday party, too?<eos> - Meh<eos> - REBECCA: Kevin! - Hey.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Uh, maybe we could invite some of your friends from school.<eos> That's okay.<eos> They have a rule that if you have a party, you have to invite the whole class.<eos> It's too many kids.<eos> - The whole class?<eos> - So we do the whole class.
Meet me at court.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Sorry! Oh, God.<eos> I really have to get in there.<eos> - Oh, Josh, over here.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> - God, it's exciting, huh?<eos> - Yeah. My dad might finally catch a break.<eos> Why do you want him to admit to something he didn't do?<eos> I don't.
Joshua, we've been all through this.<eos> The decision's been made already.<eos> Hold on, Howard.<eos> What's the evidence, Josh?<eos> A confession?<eos> DNA? An eyewitness?<eos> We discovered Rutger Hiss had glass shards in his arm!<eos> And?<eos> That's it.<eos> Well, what the [bleep] do I do with that?
And your valuable prisoners were "lost."<eos> According to your report, you arrived. And discovered forst dead.<eos> He had been shot in the attack.<eos> As were the other soldiers on the convoy.<eos> Forst was the only one. Bludgeoned, severely beaten, and then shot.<eos> He was a senior officer.<eos> It's likely that the attackers tortured and questioned him.<eos> Or perhaps he discovered you had facilitated.<eos> The escape of the spies. And it was you who killed him?<eos> He didn't. And I didn't.
Unless you might be losing perspective. Don't... Don't lecture me.<eos> If it's distracting you.<eos> From the bigger picture.<eos> I'm not lecturing; I'm just concerned about you.<eos> I might be attracted to him?<eos> That he might be playing you, using your trust...<eos> I told you.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I don't anymore.
But if they ever lift that Cuban embargo, I might expand my horizons.<eos> Got a light?<eos> How sick are you?<eos> It's all relative.<eos> Cancer.<eos> It's gonna get ugly.<eos> Especially without treatment.<eos> Even with treatment.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do.
- So, I, you know...<eos> - Mission accomplished.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's take the rest of the day off.<eos> - Have some drinks.<eos> - Drinks?<eos> I... Yeah, let's not... Let's have a welcome party.<eos> You know? We're all new. Let's get to know each other.<eos> Who wants to go to Malibu?<eos> - I do!
And you took this job because no one else would hire you.<eos> Who are you now, Robert Evans?<eos> You haven't done this before.<eos> - You haven't done anything.<eos> - GLOW is my idea!<eos> So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Overall, extremely positive.<eos> Just a few concerns.<eos> Specifically, the, uh... The colorful language and the KKK.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You didn't like that one, Glen?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> - I'll tell you what I did love:<eos> The two black girls.<eos> We want more of them.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
What can I say? I love a Hail Mary.<eos> I'm gonna charm old people.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Come back, play more Brubeck, then get the fuck out of here.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Got any blow?<eos> No. We don't.
Hey!<eos> No excessive force!<eos> I told her I was hungry!<eos> That's a write-up and a white card.<eos> It's totally worth it.<eos> Now you're gonna get me something to eat!<eos> "Just another patient"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Kristen doesn't scare you.<eos> She sure does.
My God!<eos> - Look at this.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Do you see this?<eos> - Come on! - Come over here.<eos> David Haller.<eos> As I said...<eos> They have her.<eos> Division Three.<eos> They probably do.
Megan, Megan, Megan.<eos> She'll say it's not true, but she lies about a lot of things.<eos> Yeah? Like what?<eos> She says she likes carrots, but she doesn't, really.<eos> She cries at movies.<eos> She barfs every morning and says she didn't.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She cried when ET died.<eos> Well, who didn't?
What about everybody else?<eos> Well, we'll just go all in. Keep on fighting as long as we can.<eos> No matter what comes next, I want you to know, I'll always appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Evening, garçon.<eos> What's on the menu tonight?<eos> This... this is truly undignified.<eos> Do you want to eat or not?<eos> Well, I do, yeah.
Now the big question.<eos> Larry Henderson, did you murder your wife?<eos> His answer after the break.<eos> You're doing really great.<eos> Sorry about all the murdering stuff.<eos> Eh, it's what's in the air.<eos> Larry, stop!<eos> As your attorney, I'm advising you not to answer anything.<eos> Heidi, you have no authority to subject him to this test!<eos> Actually, I do.
How does it work?<eos> Hello?<eos> - The restaurant's been compromised.<eos> - We can't wait for the weather to clear.<eos> It's gonna take more than a hurricane to keep us from our children.<eos> - Hurricane?<eos> - Buckle up, darling.<eos> It's gonna be a bumpy flight.<eos> You were right, Klaus.<eos> A baking soda bath did wonders for our hives.
And your parents.<eos> Such brave and noble people.<eos> - Oh, how I miss them. - We miss them, too.<eos> But we have questions about them.<eos> They never told us about you. They never told us about Uncle Monty.<eos> I have a feeling there's lots of things they never told us about.<eos> Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.<eos> They were trying to keep you safe.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - No. No, it didn't.
No.<eos> You have a choice.<eos> Tender words spoken by a man just years removed from picking the bones of those weaker than he.<eos> I've denied what I'm supposed to be.<eos> Vile.<eos> Lost.<eos> Lonely.<eos> Angry.<eos> It never felt like me.<eos> But today, it does.
I didn't do any of this on my own.<eos> Just give me the diamonds.<eos> We had a life together, Ben.<eos> We were going to have a future together.<eos> And then you chose her.<eos> So, yes, I stole your diamonds, but that is nothing compared to what you've stolen from me.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I want you to disappear.<eos> I want every moment I wasted on you back.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm wiped.<eos> I smell blood.<eos> A lot of it.<eos> You let him out, didn't you?<eos> No, she did.<eos> So, if it bites you, do you...<eos> You're born a were, dimwit.<eos> Not exactly common knowledge.<eos> Weretigers are rare nowadays.<eos> - So the Rev did that?
Yeah. There's still something there, you know?<eos> But I'm human again, so we're back to square one. Or two.<eos> Or I've lost count of the squares.<eos> Nazi!<eos> And stuff with Peyton?<eos> She made her choice with Blaine, I probably drove her into his arms.<eos> Nazi!<eos> I left a lengthy apology on her voice-mail.<eos> How'd she respond?<eos> She didn't.
That was really weird and horrifying, but then...<eos> Looking in the mirror, seeing you...<eos> Being able to hold your hand...<eos> I don't know.<eos> He has to take his pills, though.<eos> If he doesn't, he gets in trouble, and they don't... the hospital... they don't know where he is.<eos> You don't really believe he needs those pills, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
David, please.<eos> - No. - David, please.<eos> Stop it. No, stop it.<eos> They're hurting me with their big, hard...<eos> He's heating up.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Ambient pressure increasing incrementally.<eos> No! Don't!<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
You won't get any parades.<eos> Hello, mags.<eos> The official secrets act means.<eos> You don't talk.<eos> Ever.<eos> Your family will never know what you did.<eos> But everything you do.<eos> Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see,<eos> The people you don't.
My hands. Here. Share, share.<eos> Monty, what next?<eos> Ok. We need to connect the Ark power to the generator conduits.<eos> Look for a red-and-black wire.<eos> All right. Got it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oxygen level... critical.<eos> Hey, Monty, Monty, Monty, no.<eos> Hey, hey, it's connected.<eos> What do I do?
If not, I won't.<eos> He's right.<eos> You should, uh, get some rest.<eos> - Dinner can wait.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but...
What is wrong with you?<eos> Nothing. Nothing wrong with me.<eos> We have a patient who's counting on us.<eos> No, not us.<eos> Me.<eos> And there's no organs, there's nothing I can do, so just leave me the hell alone.<eos> I mean, this isn't you.<eos> You don't get wasted in bars and bail on your patients...<eos> I didn't bail on anyone!<eos> So, how we doing over here?
You're gifted.<eos> Behind all the puzzles... Well, all of science, really... There are two tasks, right?<eos> Observe and analyze.<eos> I bet it would be really hard to make a thoughtful observation if you... say... couldn't hear.<eos> So... What do you know about Phase Two?<eos> I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know you.<eos> You... you made me breakfast in bed, and... and... You didn't need to do that.<eos> You wanted to.<eos> I think that you care about me.<eos> That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
30 years with the Bureau.<eos> This morning, his body was found under a pile of rubble.<eos> Michael's daughter was supposed to get married this Sunday.<eos> You killed him.<eos> No... I didn't do that.<eos> I don't even know who that man is.<eos> How can you know what you have or have not done?<eos> I thought you couldn't remember anything.<eos> Unless, of course... you do remember.<eos> I don't!
Another clamp.<eos> Hang more FFP.<eos> Right angle.<eos> Dr. Robbins, this baby's tanking. I think we need to get her into the O.R.<eos> Who's with you?<eos> Barton.<eos> Ugh! Barton's no good for this.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - I need to be here.<eos> No, you don't.
because I'm good.<eos> That's not...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She asked you a question. She needed an answer.<eos> I know.<eos> What kind of teacher are you?<eos> I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands. You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
Never?<eos> Not a kid.<eos> Not in residency, not as a fellow, and now I work on athletes...<eos> And old people... old, broken hips, torn ligaments.<eos> Never a little boy.<eos> I took that boy from his parents. And now I have to tell them.<eos> And I don't know how.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you stop feeling like this?<eos> You don't.
Dr. Webber asked me to come back.<eos> There was no folding.<eos> If you say so.<eos> If you're into the guy, why not just be with him?<eos> - Because I don't want to be with him.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it. No.<eos> I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.

Enough with the lilies.<eos> You know, some of us have allergies.<eos> Oh, I'm actually a new associate here.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Just go tell your head florist no more lilies.<eos> Maia Rindell?<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> And don't sit.<eos> Maia.<eos> How you doing?
How's $90,000?<eos> What is he, a drug dealer?<eos> No, it's Bitcoin.<eos> It's trading at $1,226.<eos> More than gold.<eos> And he wants us to do what?<eos> This is the malware from his computer.<eos> He wants us to offer the feds a deal.<eos> He will defuse the malware from the power grid if they offer him immunity.<eos> And if they don't?
For the express purpose of taking it to England for this procedure, which they have now been forbidden from doing.<eos> Nicholas Haight, Courtney Haight, I, uh, take it that your sojourn to England is no longer happening?<eos> That is correct, Your Honor.<eos> And what do your clients want to do with the embryo?<eos> They would like to have it destroyed.<eos> Let-let me, uh, see if I can put this in a way that you lawyers will like.<eos> Your clients bought a stolen car, and now, rather than see it driven by its rightful owner, they want to bring it to the dump and flatten it.<eos> Mr. Haight fertilized the egg.<eos> It's half his. He doesn't want this child.<eos> But I do, Your Honor.
And we never agreed to anything other than his bail.<eos> I'll... let's deal with this later.<eos> Okay? Okay.<eos> Do I know you? No.<eos> I don't think so, which is weird because we've been moving in the same circles for years.<eos> Okay. Who are you?<eos> Elsbeth Tascioni.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't like eating alone, do you?<eos> - I do, actually.
- Excuse me, won't you?<eos> Oh! Of course.<eos> I need to talk with you about the things you approved this morning. OK.<eos> Why are we whispering?<eos> Because you're gonna have to un-approve them.<eos> I will not!<eos> As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do.

You clearly have a lot of walls up, Lucifer.<eos> Between yourself and your emotions, and now between yourself and me.<eos> If you're unwilling to bring those walls down, I can't help you.<eos> What the hell, Decker?<eos> No breakfast? I forgot.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You forgot?<eos> Chloe Decker forgot?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What did you do with my roommate?
Action.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> I think she's going into labor!<eos> Help me!<eos> How can I help when I'm supposed to kill my own father?<eos> And cut.<eos> It's a little dark, buddy.<eos> - You know, just try to have fun with it.<eos> But I thought you told me this helped you work through difficult personal matters.<eos> I did.
Okay, well, that's a little weird.<eos> And creepy.<eos> And if the mom knows where we live, maybe the killer does, too.<eos> Tell me about Agnes.<eos> She is blissfully unaware that her parents are talking about a serial killer.<eos> Liz, what can I do?<eos> How can I help?<eos> You are helping.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat? - Dinner with Riggs.<eos> - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> With Riggs.<eos> When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
That means the vessels to his lungs are constricted. He's basically suffocating from the inside.<eos> Ugh. Need air.<eos> Yeah, I know, man. I know. Just hang on there.<eos> Okay, I need you to, uh, get me the O2 and get on the speaker and ask if anybody has some erectile-dysfunction pills.<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> - I'll open up his vessels. It could save his life.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> Okay, okay. Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs? Yes, ma'am. Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
I'm so glad we found each other.<eos> Me too, dumpling.<eos> Every day.<eos> It's, like, affecting my body and soul.<eos> Does make you want to puke.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Talk to me.<eos> - You don't want to know. - It's okay.<eos> What if they're all dead? They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Priests get scared, too.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my Dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> You? Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
They think she's evil.<eos> That's a bit of a stretch.<eos> You saw her kill a woman, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sounds evil to me.<eos> Now what do you want to do about it?<eos> Well, we can't have a murderer walking around.<eos> Right.<eos> We'll send her out into the mist.<eos> Now what do we do about Eve?
You know, I saw that cut on your forehead.<eos> I guess I must have misread things.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> We all make mistakes, huh?<eos> Sorry I doubted you.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You said it needed to be fixed, so I called Cousin Mike in Jersey.<eos> Cousin Mike?<eos> How... how did he fix it so fast?<eos> Oh, he didn't.
Where did this come from?<eos> You'd be amazed what this place has in its storage closet.<eos> Huh.<eos> Davy Crockett?<eos> What did I miss?<eos> Turns out our agency has a pedigree.<eos> Paul Jennings, Davy Crockett, Sacagawea.<eos> Every one of them is an American hero, and they all worked right here in this room together.<eos> I always thought Daniel Boone was the one who wore the fur cap.<eos> - Ah, technically, they both did.
Aunt Mackenzie.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were young.<eos> Sabrina's going to Yale next year.<eos> I got into Yale, that doesn't mean I'm going.<eos> - Well, you sh... - That's probably a good call.<eos> Cute.<eos> Remind me, what do you do again?<eos> You know how it goes.<eos> Just kind of in between things.<eos> I don't... but good luck with your things.
Mickey isn't here.<eos> I am!<eos> Me.<eos> Your best friend.<eos> So, What's it gonna be?<eos> Oh, it's like that, huh?<eos> That is fine.<eos> I didn't want it to come down like this, But you leave me no other choice.<eos> Now tell me! Who did it, benito?<eos> Who did it? Who did it?
Used to be mom's suit, now it's my suit.<eos> Oh, your breath reeks of booze.<eos> Oh, does it?<eos> Yeah. You gonna go tell on me, donnie brasco?<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> ugh. Hope you have a plan.<eos> Yeah, i'll pop 'em in or something.<eos> For the hearing! Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, are you kidding me?<eos> Of course i do!
Slow down!<eos> Oh, no! Oh, no!<eos> Oh, I think I killed him!<eos> I killed him!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Anybody!<eos> Anybody! Help!<eos> Keep up!<eos> Get off my back! I didn't berate you when you barfed all over the sidewalk.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Oh, no! Oh, no!<eos> Oh, I think I killed him!<eos> I killed him!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Anybody!<eos> Anybody! Help!<eos> Keep up!<eos> Get off my back! I didn't berate you when you barfed all over the sidewalk.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
It's mine, too, but I don't have enough to create a weapon.<eos> I've got a plan for that.<eos> But first we need to draw the creature, and the puzzle box is a pile of splinters.<eos> I can 3-d-print a replica.<eos> I mean, not out of enchanted teakwood, but it might be able to hold the demon for a little bit, if at all.<eos> As long as it will lure it towards us.<eos> Look, I'll research the correct symbology to paint in gold leaf onto your version of the box.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, miss Jenny, you say you have a plan to procure enough gold to make weaponry.<eos> I do.
And now that I've come back and changed everything, the young girl who is your daughter will have a completely different future.<eos> We'll always be two different people.<eos> I just... I don't know what kind of future it'll be.<eos> Crane, uh, he wasn't meant to be shot.<eos> Meaning what, that Dreyfuss might still take over the world?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Well, if we save Crane, then maybe it'll stop Dreyfuss.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But then what if Dreyfuss still goes after Molly?<eos> I don't...
It's hurtful.<eos> Yeah. Hurtful.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I brought the photos to you this time.<eos> So, I notice the patrol cars downstairs were gone.<eos> I sent it away.<eos> You-You sent them away. How?<eos> I e-mailed law firms that specialize in suing the LAPD till I found a junior partner willing to draft a letter.<eos> Well, there's people that are trying to kill you, so if you'd like to stay alive, - it might behoove...<eos> - What if I don't?
Idiot.<eos> Mick, we gotta go.<eos> Look, this is a heist.<eos> We have to steal the other pieces of the spear and get out of here.<eos> You think this is what Snart wants?<eos> You waiting around so that you can get caught?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> That looks like something you might hide something in.<eos> Yes, it does.
I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> In short, my fellow travelers and I...<eos> Fellowship, if you will.<eos> We're on a journey to destroy an object.<eos> One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
A hero.<eos> Don't even think about it!<eos> That is not a scratcher of any variety.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> I saw Snart again.<eos> More likely, you took a nasty blow on the battlefield.<eos> Perhaps you're suffering some minor brain damage or, at least, more brain damage.<eos> Snart did this!<eos> I believe you.<eos> - You do?
What if Thawne is trying to destroy the Spear?<eos> Impossible. You need the blood of Christ to destroy it.<eos> That's why Rip broke it up into so many pieces.<eos> Unless he figured out there's another way, by incinerating it.<eos> But why would Thawne want to destroy the Spear?<eos> No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
Done. It's sent.<eos> All right.<eos> Now we wait.<eos> We're working on all channels here.<eos> Matt Cruz is on with the consulate right now.<eos> We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too.
You got in the car. You kissed him.<eos> A friendly kiss.<eos> I don't kiss my friends like that.<eos> Well, I do, and you should have called me, and not run to Rafael.<eos> I don't want him to get hurt.<eos> And what about me?<eos> I've known you for a month and you've lied the whole time.<eos> He's my child's father.<eos> Well, I guess I know where your loyalties lie.<eos> Yes, you do.
I was abroad, studying in Spain.<eos> I dropped out the week after Travis raped me.<eos> Transferred out of state the next semester.<eos> I just needed to get as far away as I could.<eos> But I did follow Sophie's trial, and I was devastated when she was convicted.<eos> But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
I've made my decision.<eos> I'm gonna say no to Gavin Belson... shut it down, and just see what happens.<eos> What the fuck, huh? What the fuck?<eos> Jian-Yang!<eos> Hey, Gavin.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Listen, Gavin.<eos> I've thought about it, and if this is about you buying PiperChat...<eos> I didn't come here today to buy your company.<eos> You didn't?
But if you were not such a disappointment, Aethelwold, I may have had you killed.<eos> For the good of Wessex.<eos> Never doubt it, every decision I make is for my country.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> I understand completely.<eos> Lord 0dda.<eos> You will set tongues wagging, drinking with the peasants.<eos> Let them wag if it please them.<eos> You asked me some days ago if I agree with the payment of a ransom.<eos> I do not.
I want you to tell me everything you know about this, about what's happening.<eos> Why?<eos> Because one of us is getting pulled out there soon.<eos> Listen, I know you never thought I was cut out for this job, but I was, and I am.<eos> So finish what you started telling me on the way to the bunker.<eos> Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
All we have to do is improvise a little.<eos> Yeah, even if we find him, how do we get him out of here now that his name's been flagged?<eos> We get him new papers with a new alias.<eos> It doesn't have to be good, just enough to get him over the border.<eos> Street quality, like common criminals use.<eos> Well, I'll have you know street quality is far superior to what the U.S. government use, and when it comes to common criminals, I may know one or three.<eos> Why don't you two go and get Owen's IDs while we work on finding him?<eos> How?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
_<eos> You get him to the rendezvous point.<eos> - I'll meet you there.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes...<eos> Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
This is wrong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Gunned down on her way home from work?<eos> Who deserves that?<eos> After everything you've been through, you should be stronger than this.<eos> And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't. They do.
- Do it.<eos> - No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
- No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
- Well, not exactly. - Oh.<eos> You were seven.<eos> Plus, the act of remembering changes things.<eos> I read this article in The New Yorker. Show off.<eos> It was about flashbulb memories.<eos> Oh, yeah, I read that one.<eos> Apparently, memories around big events seem clearer, but the periphery disappears.<eos> You remember the feeling, not the details. - No.<eos> I remember it exactly.<eos> - He doesn't.
Mom, you're an adult.<eos> Teenagers are mean, and I think that if you were there, she would be a little more self-conscious about being a bitch. Please?<eos> Mateo puked on me twice.<eos> Yeah, okay fine.<eos> He did?<eos> Yeah, but then he seemed okay.<eos> Oh, shoot, can I have a tampon?<eos> I forgot to go to the store.<eos> - Sorry, I don't have my period.<eos> - You don't?
Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow.<eos> All crows talk. They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
And while she helped bring alexei lagunov to justice, she also forfeited the rest of her life in doing so.<eos> She's on that list.<eos> Who is she to you?<eos> Maureen Rowan is Kate's...<eos> Mr kaplan's sister.<eos> I didn't need to find her.<eos> I just needed to make sure no one else can.<eos> This doesn't excuse what you've done.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
He dedicated it to Summer.<eos> And how does that song go?<eos> Objection.<eos> Irrelevant.<eos> Overruled.<eos> I want to see where this is going.<eos> - Ms. Flatch, you truly are delightful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And you have some wonderful things to say about Mr. Henderson.<eos> I do.
I've lost my way.<eos> Robbie and Meghan, they are who they are because of me.<eos> I brought God's wrath down on my own family, and I stabbed my own son.<eos> Maybe we can help each other.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know what I want.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> - Owe you one.<eos> - Get what you wanted?<eos> We both did.
You know, if I'm not mistaken, I think that was Moreno, burying the hatchet.<eos> Ah, the man's just sharpening his blade.<eos> Now there's gonna be a trial, and you're gonna be asked to testify, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> And Meghan, he's gonna go away for life.<eos> You're never gonna have to worry about him hurting you again.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> And thank you for letting me stay here today.<eos> You have a really nice family.<eos> I do.
Troy, just because you know everything, doesn't mean you have to say everything.<eos> I go outside for 10 seconds.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> According to the file I saw at the Bureau, Justine's husband was on assignment to infiltrate some arms dealers, code-named Argosy.<eos> The operation was highly classified, then terminated two months later.<eos> That was six months ago.<eos> Everyone came home.<eos> Except for Eddie.<eos> And you never heard from him?<eos> No, I did.
I always sort of had to be one of the guys.<eos> I tried playing softball but hated it.<eos> Would have rather played baseball, but there wasn't anything like that then.<eos> So, you never played?<eos> Nothing official, just pick-up games in our neighborhood.<eos> Now I play in my company's intramural league.<eos> She won't let me go to the games.<eos> He gets too excited.<eos> - Well, it's exciting.<eos> - You do!
Yeah.<eos> No, I mean it.<eos> The... the things I deal with with families...<eos> I'm not saying it's the same as yours.<eos> No one's is the same as mine.<eos> You'd be surprised how many people feel that way.<eos> This might help you understand them a little bit.<eos> Marx?<eos> I thought he hated religion.<eos> Uh, h-he did.
- Holy [bleep]!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Get down! Get down!<eos> I think it's over!<eos> We gotta barricade the door!<eos> Cannonball accidents almost never happen in New York.<eos> ...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo! Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
We gotta barricade the door!<eos> Cannonball accidents almost never happen in New York.<eos> ...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo! Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Davis... is the chief benefactor of the East Peck Historical Society, who fire the commemorative cannonballs.<eos> Shortly after I approached him with incriminating information, a cannonball flew through my window.<eos> That doesn't just happen.<eos> Actually, it does.
I'm interested.<eos> He used one of them... to kill her.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Jeremiah! Oh, for [bleep] sake!<eos> That's a gimme.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> You know, it's weird...<eos> You hit a bad shot, but you didn't throw that club away.<eos> Why should I throw away a perfectly good golf club?<eos> You did yesterday.
The thing is, this guy, he didn't do anything.<eos> The opposite.<eos> I don't see putting him at risk so we can go after some other people.<eos> Revenge isn't that important.<eos> And I don't think it would be to Frank.<eos> He would want revenge. Hey.<eos> Hi, Henry.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-Sure. Everything okay? S-So... you know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
Men.<eos> Nobody suitable.<eos> Well, as soon as your language improves, we'll see to it that we find you a job at a paper or in publishing, translating.<eos> Y-You'll meet people.<eos> Clark thinks about you, Martha.<eos> He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
I know I made a mistake.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I f- - I failed you.<eos> I failed my people.<eos> Everything you've been through, your family, your country... you're special, Tuan.<eos> I admire you.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You're fighting so things like that won't happen to other people.<eos> I wish I could tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
I know a lot about you, Emma.<eos> You faked your own death, and hid in the past.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No, you don't.
Rufus, I'm not gonna hurt anyone.<eos> This is just something I got to do.<eos> You think Bruhl was telling the truth?<eos> I-I don't know, but if he is and he's going to blow up the Mothership,<eos> I think we should destroy the Lifeboat. What about your sister?<eos> We get her back first, of course.<eos> But Bruhl's right.<eos> These machines are too dangerous... nobody should have them in the first place.<eos> You think Mason or my bosses are just gonna smile and say, "Sure, let's torch it"?<eos> No, we do it ourselves.
I just think it's all over for me now.<eos> No, it's... it's not over.<eos> I chose to partner with you. That...<eos> That says something.<eos> You didn't want me.<eos> You wanted the patent.<eos> If I had just given it to you, you would've walked out that door and never looked back.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> I'm done.<eos> Done? No.
There's this point in the tavern, uh, where you meet this barmaid, and you can look wherever you want, however long you want.<eos> Yeah, well, um, look, the demo is amazing... when you run it on a $10,000 rig.<eos> But the future of VR is mobile, and there's no phone on Earth that could handle that demo, let alone the full-bloated platform.<eos> Isn't that why Keenan has acquired us?<eos> I mean, to help him figure that out?<eos> No, he just wants you to make the demo better so he can take as much money off the table as he can.<eos> He'll walk away rich, the company will crater, and you will go down with it, and that would be the end of Pied Piper.<eos> Richard, you have to tell Keenan that you're not gonna take this deal.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What do I do?
"Find me where there is none."<eos> "You are my light.<eos> Love, dad."<eos> Pedophile had an alibi.<eos> You talk to him?<eos> The tribal police has him on security footage at late night bingo.<eos> Also... Dr. Allan says the tooth was Jesse's.<eos> Shit.<eos> Remember those riddles that I got when I was young?<eos> Of course I do.
You getting any work from mark?<eos> There's just no work.<eos> Maybe the brewery.<eos> You have to make things, that's what you love.<eos> There's a guy I know, makes custom furniture. He's wants to branch out.<eos> Hey, why not?<eos> You, you already have those skills.<eos> I got those skills like I built Daisy a shitty Dollhouse.<eos> It was a prefect Dollhouse and I can tell you want to do it.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.
I never should've put him or anybody else in that position, not Sebastian, not Patton, not anybody.<eos> Last time I sent somebody over to Garcia's place she ended up dead.<eos> Look, Dwayne, first of all, you didn't ask for our help.<eos> In fact, it was the opposite; we chose to help.<eos> Which means we all knew the risks going in, even Sebastian.<eos> And Patton, too.<eos> He may be struggling, but he's still at OTB, still game.<eos> Look, if you want to blame yourself for anything, do it for surrounding yourself with people who are just as stubborn and bullheaded as you.<eos> Besides, you're not the only one who wants to make Garcia pay;<eos> we all do.
This is yours, ooda?<eos> If you want to work with my husband, do not spy on him.<eos> From now on, you have to be honest with both of us.<eos> We should talk about this inside.<eos> Come here.<eos> I came to tell you that Noah raised the plane without the Road Demons' help, but they still want a new price.<eos> If they don't get it, they'll take their business somewhere else and Eli Voss loses his biggest customer.<eos> Saying yes makes Voss look weaker, which is even more dangerous.<eos> Noah has no idea how to deal with men like Mr. Crowbar.<eos> - And you do?
I think his name is "Chad"?<eos> Just so I completely understand,<eos> - Crowbar wants...<eos> - 25% off.<eos> And you think if Noah brings this offer to Eli Voss...<eos> He will make an example of my husband, and then my family.<eos> Then he will go after the ones who made the offer, your husband and your family.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> I thought you were pacifists.<eos> So what do we do now?
How did you get the Demons to back off?<eos> You had one job, Joey: find a driver.<eos> If this doesn't get to Voss, we are all in trouble.<eos> Now, can we trust you to do this one thing or do we have to find someone else?<eos> Nee.<eos> Nee, I'll work on it.<eos> If not, someone will have to call Onkel<eos> - and explain the delay. - I said, I'll work on it.<eos> - Besides, no one calls Onkel.<eos> - Someone does.
Yeah, I found the evidence bag in your desk!<eos> Because you put it there, you loser!<eos> You're pathetic, Novak.<eos> I'm done with you, man.<eos> All the charges against the Mennonites have been dropped because of your incompetence, Novak.<eos> Not his, yours!<eos> So if you can still find your own badge, I want it on my desk.<eos> He said the lives of your children are hanging by a thread?<eos> Jo,but he doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, he does, Brooda.
Am I about to have another stepmummy?<eos> Tessa, run along.<eos> Felicity and I need to discuss a job that she's going to be helping me with.<eos> Really?<eos> Can't I help with the job?<eos> You're not old enough, I'm afraid.<eos> Then why not Dad?<eos> You two should work together more often.<eos> Because as you well know, your father no longer works for the Firm.<eos> And she does?
'Cause I'm about to be you for a second and tell you that, if Alice Vaughan were the one trapped inside Argosy, you'd be doing exactly what I'm about to do.<eos> Are you gonna tell Alice and Val?<eos> What, that you're dating a murderer?<eos> She is a murderer, Daniel.<eos> Or is the sex so good that you can't see that?<eos> Don't answer that question.<eos> It's not just about sex.<eos> So you mean you have a deep, spiritual connection to a murderer?<eos> You don't know her, okay?<eos> And you do?
And you were right.<eos> I shouldn't have gotten involved with Ethan.<eos> I just hope I haven't ruined his life again.<eos> Allie... you made his day.<eos> He put that woman in front of you for a reason.<eos> Yeah, so that I could see how much better she is than me.<eos> First of all, she's not.<eos> And second of all, yes, exactly.<eos> He wants to know you still care.<eos> Well, I don't.
Kamino...<eos> It's a really nice dress, worn by those people.<eos> Kimono.<eos> What its called.<eos> Wear it.<eos> Wow... it's got a seatbelt, this goes here and this one here...<eos> Double up.<eos> I got shoes for you, and you got me this.<eos> You didn't like it'?<eos> Of course I did...
I don't want any trouble.<eos> Let's just take this down a notch, before...<eos> Before what?<eos> You think just 'cause you're a cop you ain't got to watch where you're going? Hey.<eos> What?<eos> You got something for me, cop?<eos> Over there!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> I thought you said he went this way.<eos> He did.
God damn it!<eos> - Where's Quentin?<eos> - What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Julia's not here either.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.
- Where's Quentin?<eos> - What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Julia's not here either.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.<eos> I do what?
- Yeah. - Come on in.<eos> Hey, Heather, you've got company!<eos> Something smells good.<eos> Yeah, we're making apple pie.<eos> It'll be ready in about an hour if you wanna sit and chat.<eos> Chat for an hour?<eos> I like apple pie, but not that much.<eos> Mr. Bennett. Good to see you.<eos> Hi, Heather.<eos> How you doing?
Is his ass a cigarette lighter?<eos> You said you wanted to visit all 50 states and you never got to do it.<eos> Hopefully he fixes that.<eos> Well... never had anyone take my money and buy me a gift with it.<eos> Actually, that's not true.<eos> My sons do it every year on my birthday.<eos> Look, Clint, I appreciate you payin' me back.<eos> And honestly, I'm surprised you remember I wanted to travel.<eos> - But if you think this makes up for...<eos> - I don't.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I hardly felt it.<eos> Shut up.<eos> A break... I... I gotta put these cucumbers out.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right, I'm done.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Well... does the break room have a lock on the door?<eos> It does.
How much money do you think you've actually made on these lockers over the past two years?<eos> I don't know, a little over $1,000.<eos> So, you just threw most of that back today on one locker.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> My sister's got it better than us, and she's in jail.<eos> Hot damn, you serious?<eos> I got a good feeling about this one, okay?<eos> Oh, baby, you always do.<eos> I got a good feeling about this one.<eos> You always do.
But, you know, you stick around long enough, let people warm up to you, they come around.<eos> So that's why Iraq is such a beacon of peace in the world today.<eos> Look, over there.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Couple of days ago, those guys would have been running from us.<eos> But now that they know we're not leaving...<eos> So you won over their hearts?<eos> That's what you're saying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I did.
If you two are gonna act like children, then we're gonna treat you like children.<eos> Go. Make up.<eos> That's two.<eos> As I have told you 1,000 times before, I am very, very sorry about the way you were portrayed on the De Le Vega-Factor Factor, but I didn't know.<eos> And I had no say in it.<eos> You're a producer.<eos> Everybody that works in television is a producer.<eos> You knew they were gonna portray me like that.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - You did.
The type of stuff that we do all the time. You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> Who needs some phony razzle-dazzle?<eos> We walk into burning buildings for a living. Let's show them what we got.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can see you.<eos> You know, whoever's out there, I've got a call button, and I'm not afraid to use it.<eos> I thought you were all laid up.<eos> I'm sore, but I'm fine.<eos> How you doing?
That process has now been expedited.<eos> So what is the plan, if you don't mind me asking?<eos> This.<eos> A gravity tractor.<eos> Oh, that would deflect the asteroid using gravitational pull.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field. Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
You said the technology doesn't exist yet.<eos> If you're so damn smart, invent it.<eos> You've got the resources, the talent, the money.<eos> Don't save 160 people, save them all.<eos> Every last one.<eos> Come work with us.<eos> Let's do this together.<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> I'll roll through red tape, whatever you need from me, but, damn it, my daughter deserves a future.<eos> They all do.
There's plenty more.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes?<eos> What is the nature of your emergency?<eos> Yes, good morning.<eos> I need to take Anne Shirley home.<eos> She was adopted.<eos> She's no longer in residence.<eos> But she... she came back here yesterday, did she not?<eos> - She did not.
This is Jane Andrews and Josie Pye and Ruby Gillis and Tillie Boulter.<eos> Everybody, this is Anne.<eos> - Hello, Anne. - Hello.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> It is a scrumptious pleasure to make your acquaintances.<eos> And I shall do my utmost to prove myself worthy of your friendship.<eos> Uh, Anne loves to read. And she knows ever so many big words.<eos> Does she use them all in every sentence?<eos> I like to read, too.<eos> No, you don't.

And she knows ever so many big words.<eos> Does she use them all in every sentence?<eos> I like to read, too.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't.
That is why I have placed you in command of our armies.<eos> I trust you completely.<eos> It's why I always used you.<eos> You loved Athelstan.<eos> Right?<eos> You loved Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> You love Judith.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you love me, Father?<eos> Do you?
What if you're just like the rest of us mere mortals?<eos> What if the castle you've built is no foundation?<eos> What if the poison that inhabits it kills all who live there, including it's maker?<eos> You are a fool.<eos> Not so foolish as to believe I have divine powers.<eos> You are a fool and a liar.<eos> You must be keen to return to the eager arms of the Madame de Montespan.<eos> No doubt, she will offer you respite from your sleepless nightmares.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
Do you think I'm a bad copper?<eos> - You shouldn't be here, dawn.<eos> - Do you think I'm a bad copper?<eos> No.<eos> Terrible person?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you think That I wanted him to die?<eos> No.<eos> - He's got a knife, and he Could've gone for us at any second.<eos> - But he didn't.
For your penance, say three hail marys.<eos> And then say an our Father for father matthew.<eos> Yes, father.<eos> God, the father of mercies,<eos> Through the death and Resurrection of his son.<eos> Has reconciled the world to himself And sent the holy spirit among us. For the forgiveness of sins.<eos> Through the ministry of the church, May god give you pardon and peace.<eos> I'm sorry, dawn, but...<eos> He didn't Pose a threat.<eos> He just didn't.
It won't keep, I'm afraid.<eos> You're a good copper, andrew.<eos> That's why I wanted to come round myself.<eos> There are one or two issues...<eos> I'm absolutely sure we can Sort them out between us.<eos> Sir? On the night of the incident, you Didn't sign out your cs spray.<eos> What?<eos> Well, it's a simple mistake, I know.<eos> I did. I'm... I'm sure I did.<eos> Well... You didn't.
I was just telling him to relax.<eos> And yes, Trish, dinner sounds lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Perfect.<eos> See?<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You're just dumb, you know that?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Is there one?<eos> Nope. Not for me.<eos> Don't.<eos> What?<eos> The little shrinky smile thing that you do; don't do it.<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
And anybody else who tries to get to him, including cops.<eos> Well, we're pretty smart, too.<eos> At least I am.<eos> He's got other qualities.<eos> I'm an excellent dancer.<eos> - What are we...<eos> - Just stop. It's what they do.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> You guys don't understand.<eos> Angelo doesn't do time.
- Sir.<eos> Madam.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And how are you, Maigret?<eos> We were very sorry to hear about Claude Dumoulin.<eos> Well, thank you, Claire.<eos> But I'm well.<eos> Maigret said there was hardly anyone at Claude's funeral.<eos> - Well, I know the wives shouldn't get involved --<eos> - Then don't.
And we'll be searching your sister's room, so we'll need the key.<eos> Of course.<eos> Follow him.<eos> Are you not worried that my brother will use his trip to Paris to run?<eos> No.<eos> What makes you so confident?<eos> Because I believed him when he said he didn't know Isaac Goldberg.<eos> Was that his name?<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I knew him?<eos> Did you?
I didn't screw this up, Gibbs.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Okay"?<eos> That's rich.<eos> What else is there for you to fix?<eos> My parents died when I was three.<eos> I got passed around foster care, drugs...<eos> Yeah, I read all that in the file, Reeves.<eos> I don't need you to worry about me.<eos> I don't... but Bishop does.
Astronomers and alcohol.<eos> Bad combination.<eos> Hey, that guy in the video said that you like to keep secrets.<eos> Like he had something on you.<eos> Best not to rely on guys playing dress-up on the internet for reliable intelligence.<eos> I-I don't have any idea what he's talking about, Murph.<eos> Guy's crazy.<eos> Hey, that's Havana.<eos> Since when do you like Cuban music?<eos> I don't. But you do.
We know that that $50,000 bonus would have gone a long way to saving your ass.<eos> So you think I killed Mitch for that bonus money.<eos> Well, you're a sharp guy.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's a great theory and all, but here's the thing... I didn't do it.<eos> So... sorry you had to waste your time.<eos> But since you have me here, what kind of car are you driving?<eos> Because we have some incredible lease programs right now.<eos> Okay, the only thing I want to hear out of you right now is your alibi for last night, assuming you have one.<eos> You got one of those?<eos> I do.
This can't be allowed to get into the atmosphere.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> We can't search a whole planet in a few minutes.<eos> Narrow it down.<eos> They landed the pyramid in the middle of military crisis - what was the point of that?<eos> OK, what was the point?<eos> What was the effect?<eos> They told us the world was ending in a potential war zone - what did we assume was going to happen?<eos> World War Three.<eos> But it didn't.
The whole codependent mess.<eos> No one can make somebody get sober.<eos> They have to want it.<eos> And even if they do, sometimes it just doesn't work.<eos> Maybe you should move back to New York.<eos> Finish Julliard.<eos> Go on a big world tour, meet all these new people.<eos> I thought you wanted me to stay.<eos> Then it's Julliard.<eos> No, I do.
Hey. Yo, Frank.<eos> Yo, Frank!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Y'all were fire last night.<eos> Yeah, but Alex did a great job of updating the song.<eos> And thank you, Cott, for making us look hot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got style.<eos> You do.
Yo, Frank!<eos> Get off!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Y'all were fire last night.<eos> Yeah, but Alex did a great job of updating the song.<eos> And thank you, Cott, for making us look hot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got style.<eos> You do.<eos> Mm-hmm. You do.
I'm so sorry, Alex.<eos> She had me fooled for a minute.<eos> Stop. Just...<eos> It's all right.<eos> No, it's not all right.<eos> There's something wrong with my sister.<eos> There's something wrong with both of you.<eos> I'm sorry, Simone.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, you did.
It's gonna equal a heart attack.<eos> There's that, um... that equipment manager down there.<eos> What's his name?<eos> - Roberto something?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yeah, he and me had a pretty interesting conversation.<eos> Started talking about Hunter.<eos> It was funny... something... something about P.E.Ds?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Thank you, Father God.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Get off me.<eos> You set me up.<eos> - I was just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> You asked for my help!<eos> You did!
You're lucky.<eos> Because you've been nothing but a dick.<eos> My debt is paid to you.<eos> I know that.<eos> But you'll be borrowing more money soon.<eos> Huh. Crazies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nah, you always got my back with the girls, so I got you.<eos> Look, I didn't know you worked this shift, at the club.<eos> I don't.
You've been embarrassed of me since day one.<eos> I mean, you just tolerate me.<eos> Me coming home is to feed your guilt.<eos> I'm not embarrassed by you.<eos> You are a kind, and loving spirit, despite everything that you've been through.<eos> That I've put you through.<eos> Do you know how it feels every time I think about what these men do to you?<eos> It breaks my heart.<eos> You know how I feel to do it?<eos> Do you?
I just bought it.<eos> Really?<eos> The whole... whole place?<eos> I just... I just bought us a house.<eos> This is for us?<eos> I put it in your name.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I do. I do.
You could come with me.<eos> You could protect me from all the creepy drunk dudes.<eos> Why are you making a joke of this?<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it that you're trying to do?<eos> I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I...<eos> That I love you, too?<eos> I do.
Ever since we tricked her into getting me back on the group, she wants you out, and she has everyone wanting that.<eos> No, you're stretching.<eos> I heard 'em talking.<eos> All right, look, just go to rehearsal.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Hey, sexy.<eos> How long you been over there?<eos> I'm scared about this baby, Derek.<eos> I know you said that... you'll do whatever I want, but... I don't know what I want.<eos> Yeah, you do.
We did it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I think we did.<eos> We won the whole thing.<eos> We won.<eos> Ladies, where's your manager?<eos> The Atlanta NextFest and Honda people are waiting outside.<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> Yo, we ain't got a manager.<eos> No, we don't.
You did in my head, which is good enough for me.<eos> Why do you want to do this?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends. Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Let's run by there now.<eos> This case just keeps getting weirder.<eos> First weckler kills Roxanne, then Gary kills weckler.<eos> Then Gary comes into a large sum of money, goes on a cruise and disappears into thin air.<eos> Seems like someone is trying to clean up a mess, and making an even bigger one.<eos> Nearly 65,000 viewers!<eos> This is about to get fun.<eos> I'm already having a blast.<eos> You wanna know where zombies come from?<eos> I do.
Long way to go to hire a couple of detectives, don't you think?<eos> Sit.<eos> I've been trying to get you to help me for years.<eos> Well, you sure as hell can't ignore me now.<eos> You're gonna figure out what happened to Connor.<eos> Even if you found the person who assaulted your son, that's all we can charge him with... assault, not murder.<eos> Well, he could go to jail for years.<eos> If he's got priors, it could be decades.<eos> You don't know what will happen when you find him.<eos> Nobody does.
Don't say anything.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I only came down here to explain to you that my chef took my car without my permission, and she picked you up from the airport without my knowledge.<eos> I am extremely sorry that she inadvertently ran you over... twice... and I will pay for your hospital stay, but that's it.<eos> If you think you're getting another dime out of her or me, you have another thing coming, because though I am rich,<eos> I'm really, really rich, I have a team of lawyers that will keep you tied up in court for years.<eos> So when you get discharged, just pack up your stuff and leave, like you did when I was born, 'cause I don't wanna see you.<eos> I don't wanna talk to you. I don't want to hear from you, ever.<eos> - Wanna know why I never wrote you back?<eos> - I do, I really, really do.
Did I just hear the stripper?<eos> What are you guys doing down here?<eos> Looking for you, sweetheart!<eos> This is the guy you ran away from?<eos> Newsflash, gay.<eos> No, not him.<eos> Him!<eos> Ooh... nice!<eos> Gabi, I don't want to marry you.<eos> - You don't?
Then hand it over.<eos> And the spell to get Hook back.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> All right.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
The portal closed.<eos> You may not have killed her, but our dear spider came close enough.<eos> As her life ebbed away, the portal opened just enough to allowed dear old Mum to slip through.<eos> Oh, Gideon. Don't tell me you underestimated me.<eos> The spider was an ingenious stroke on my part, but you played yours to the hilt.<eos> I was under your thrall.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> True.<eos> But part of you wanted to help me, though, didn't it?<eos> Part of you always does.
Of the pettiness and the deterioration of a legal system...<eos> Excuse me... that we are supposed to be relying on.<eos> Did you have anything whatsoever to do with sabotaging the Riverfront site?<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Linden.<eos> You received your MBA from Columbia, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Do you remember the subject of your master's thesis?<eos> Well, it was 30 years ago.<eos> No, I don't.
- He killed Evan.<eos> He left Annaleigh without a father.<eos> He'd gladly leave her without a mother.<eos> Who's going to build things, Sarah?<eos> You?<eos> Me?<eos> Annaleigh?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> We need him.<eos> We all do.
Is that okay?<eos> Yes. Of course.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> See you, guys.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Ethan.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just that if Ben said something or did something...<eos> He didn't.
She said that she had just had a blowout with her department head.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, Maya didn't want to talk about it.<eos> I should've asked more questions.<eos> I should've done a lot of things.<eos> Um, we have to process your home for evidence tonight.<eos> Do you have someplace to stay?<eos> Mr. Kettering, do you have someplace to sleep tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, that is news to me.<eos> Then apparently you have not heard.<eos> Heard what?<eos> We are on the same team now.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> !<eos> Tell you what?<eos> Chen.<eos> How long have you known that Chen was working with the CIA?<eos> He didn't.
I didn't ask you to.<eos> Yo, who's in there?<eos> - What's up, man?<eos> - Hey, open up.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> You want some coke?<eos> - You remember Callie and...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - ...her brother Christian.<eos> - Yeah, no, I don't.
- Craig's not dumb.<eos> He burned down his own apartment, Nicky.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, he's planning a job.<eos> A big one.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Right? Is that what he told you?<eos> Craig doesn't plan jobs, okay?<eos> He's muscle.<eos> Well, he does now.
"Sorry" is cheap.<eos> You want something to mean anything, it's gotta cost.<eos> You think Craig with 20K's a good idea?<eos> - Blow me.<eos> - No, I'm serious.<eos> Do you?<eos> That's the point, isn't it?<eos> You're all adults now, and I have to learn to let go.<eos> But I want something.<eos> - Of course you do.
We both know you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.
You had no way of knowing they would do this.<eos> For now, we must cooperate.<eos> Can we trust him?<eos> He's never been predictable.<eos> Worth the risk.<eos> If the nazis get their hands. On that much oil, the war's over.<eos> How did the americans respond?<eos> Butler wants our intel.<eos> On marigold asap.<eos> Course he does.
A favor now gets you a favor later.<eos> Like, uh, like moving an inmate into a particular cell?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Pawn to King's knight 6.<eos> That guard Wilkins is threatening to tell everyone that I'm on the job.<eos> That wouldn't be too good for you.<eos> I don't get it. Everybody knows you're a fed.<eos> Yeah, but here's the difference.<eos> You say you didn't kill that doctor.<eos> I didn't. Ok.
The man came into my house, made love to my wife, and then put his foot on my wall.<eos> There are certain lines you just don't cross.<eos> Come on, Josh. What would you do?<eos> You're exactly like me.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> But I would... I would listen to my lawyer, who is telling you that nothing good will come out of confronting Rutger.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To... get some fresh air.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
I know where he is.<eos> The calla lilies look nice.<eos> I knew Margaret would never rest well knowing that she was surrounded by tulips.<eos> I mean, getting murdered, then tulips?<eos> I don't know what's worse.<eos> Probably the murder.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm starting to get you.<eos> Oh, not many people do.
(SIGHS) Welcome home.<eos> You really think it's gonna be that bad?<eos> I haven't been back to Krownest since before my time at the Imperial Academy, Ezra.<eos> And I didn't exactly leave on good terms.<eos> Well, maybe things have changed. They might be happy to see you.<eos> (CHUCKLES) You don't know my family.<eos> FENN: I do.
Everyone always cancels at the last minute.<eos> No one ever does what they say they're gonna do, and then the people treat each other like...<eos> It was lovely to meet you.<eos> Not everyone's like that.<eos> Thanks for bringing the paddles, luv.<eos> I happen to know some very reliable people in town.<eos> Total pros, proper villains.<eos> Yes, but proper isn't the same as fun, is it?<eos> You know how I like fun.<eos> I do, darling.
There must have been a flaw in their security setup over there.<eos> You think Sabatino knew about it?<eos> I don't know if he did or if he didn't, but if he did...<eos> You just found our mole. Yeah.<eos> Two years too late.<eos> Look, if there was a virus in Sabatino's e-mail, none of us were looking for it.<eos> Man, I knew something was off about this guy.<eos> I knew it. I thought he helped save you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did he?
Cosmetics.<eos> Why would Neolution be expanding into cosmetics?<eos> Well, because it's a $700 billion industry, for one.<eos> - More research dollars than cancer.<eos> - Piss off.<eos> Serious.<eos> Well, it's got to be connected to LIN28A.<eos> Did Krystal just fall arse backwards into something big again?<eos> I do not know how the girl does it.<eos> Seriously, you don't?
Put it...<eos> Kelly, Matt.<eos> How's the ankle?<eos> No secrets around here?<eos> Nope, not many.<eos> - You got a minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Just wanted you to know how much I appreciate this.<eos> Your father always said you were a good kid.<eos> He did?
However, we have been receiving texts and e-mails from an American scientist stationed there, claiming that an unidentified occupying military force has landed.<eos> You think the soldiers are Russian?<eos> He thinks so.<eos> They arrived via unmarked research vessels.<eos> We reached out to Moscow, but they're denying any official involvement.<eos> Surprise, surprise.<eos> It's a brazen act of aggression.<eos> Well, it's a crime of opportunity.<eos> Petrov thinks the US government has their eye off the ball.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.<eos> They wanna know what happened with their election.<eos> We're fixing it.<eos> Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.<eos> The statement's about the FBI. Everybody trusts the FBI.<eos> Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called. They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
She's being pushed out.<eos> Okay, but the campaign's over.<eos> Is it necessary to say anything?<eos> We need to distance this administration from her and her work. Her tactics.<eos> So it needs to be a leak.<eos> Reach out to the people who don't like us. They'll be prime to go with it.<eos> Okay, so when we respond...<eos> -On the record or...<eos> -On.<eos> What did she do?
Moretti talked about it as, uh, the last day of her life before she corrected herself.<eos> Spent every spare second with the kids. They were building a go-kart. They were pretty close to done.<eos> -Okay. -I got more.<eos> -No, I got it.<eos> -What were you looking for?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -What?<eos> You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?<eos> No, I don't.
It was his idea.<eos> Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.<eos> Are we gonna bury our heads in the sand with this?<eos> No, you're going to leave, and the vice president and I are going to decide what to do.<eos> Walker reneged.<eos> We had a deal. We will let you know if you are needed.<eos> - Sir... - That was not a request.<eos> Why did you have to go talk to him?<eos> There has to be a way out, Francis.<eos> Does there?
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.<eos> What?<eos> I killed Zoe Barnes.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.<eos> She said she wanted to be invisible.<eos> I knew it wasn't possible.<eos> I knew that she would only ever go away... if I made sure of it.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
- We have one rule, Francis. One rule. - No, not anymore.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> We don't. I cannot be your ally if I don't know what you're thinking.<eos> Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.<eos> All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary, but other committees would have sprung up, just to keep the charges going.<eos> Oversight, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.<eos> It would have gone on and on.<eos> - Years and years of investigation. - I don't care.<eos> You should have talked to me, instead of making a last-minute decision like this.<eos> I didn't.
We need a plan B to get Torres and the Playbook back safely.<eos> McGee and I might have what you're looking for.<eos> - Got footage of Victor's SUV leaving the hotel late last night.<eos> - Before it disappeared into thin air?<eos> - Actually, it didn't.<eos> The SUV passed a number of cameras while it fled the scene.<eos> Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras, pedestrians' personal cameras...<eos> If we can access that feed, we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.<eos> We don't have the resources to consolidate footage from dozens of sources to find a single target.<eos> The NSA does.
What's this about?<eos> A young boy disappeared about twenty years ago, it was rather notorious.<eos> Has he ever spoken to you about this case?<eos> Irving would never hurt a child.<eos> I know that.<eos> I see.<eos> When did you last hear from him?<eos> He wrote a letter, he said he was coming to visit, bringing some good news.<eos> Due to arrive on the Chatham train three days ago.<eos> - Of course, he never did.
Not with that big oaf dragging me in.<eos> I didn't drag you.<eos> - But if you'd like...<eos> - Let's stick to the question of the moment, shall we?<eos> Why did your wife leave you?<eos> Why do women do anything?<eos> I can't read their bird brains.<eos> Oh, that's why.<eos> When she left, did you try and win her back?<eos> - You did, didn't you?
You knew where the body was buried all along, didn't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And when your grandmother started to believe Mr. Slaight's story, you had to create a false note to lead me straight to it.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If I could take all of this back, I would.<eos> I was young, I hated Adam, I wanted him out of my life.<eos> So you hired Mr. Moses to kidnap and kill your own stepbrother.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, and I thought he had.<eos> I did.
Sometimes people say things they don't mean.<eos> Oh, that's a paradox.<eos> I-If you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.<eos> Careful, I saw this on Star Trek.<eos> Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.<eos> Hey. Hey, boys.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out, I was being offensive.<eos> So, normal. Yeah--<eos> Sheldon, what did you do?
We made love this morning.<eos> With all the bells and whistles.<eos> And, Robert?<eos> He's a little under the weather.<eos> So, um, when do you head off to your little... bunkery place?<eos> We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
You are so right.<eos> Park it next to the Honda and flesh out your antagonist.<eos> - Hey, Jay. How's Gloria, Manny, Joe, and Stella?<eos> What, do you got index cards?<eos> Listen, your chattiness is gumming up the works here.<eos> You're not here to socialize, so just get 'em in, get 'em out.<eos> Are you asking me not to talk to people?<eos> 'Cause that is what I do.<eos> And Phil don't seem to have a problem with it.<eos> No, but I do.
Oh! Wow. Look at that.<eos> Here I was beating myself up because I couldn't be alone, and... one could argue that everybody in this house is a little better off because of it.<eos> Well, I lost a dress and the house smells like smoke, so I wouldn't be high-fiving myself that much.<eos> Ah, yes, sir?<eos> Right?<eos> Nobody keeps me on edge for 500 pages then decides they're just done writing.<eos> Either end the damn story or don't even write it!<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> God, for a minute, I thought I missed something.<eos> You did.
Dr. Bull... do you think that there is such a thing as true love?<eos> I do.<eos> But this isn't it.<eos> Jordan.<eos> Susan has something she'd like to say.<eos> Jordan... I... got so caught up trying to run away from my... old life that I didn't fully think it through.<eos> Susan... No, just-just listen, okay?<eos> I... I hurt you.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
There's something wrong.<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where is he?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Hey, can I tell you a secret? Okay.<eos> Here's my secret. Okay.<eos> Normally, I'd be all over this deck, just riding your brains out.<eos> But I like you. I think there's something sweet about you.<eos> And so I want to take it slow.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah. Slow, slow...<eos> Okay.<eos> - You don't need that. - Yeah.<eos> No, I do, I do, yes.
Take off that butter face, put on your poker face.<eos> He told me what the itch could be from.<eos> Could be an allergy, could be dermatitis, and there is a slight possibility but practically impossible chance that it's an STD.<eos> - I pick STD.<eos> - Yep, that's the one.<eos> But the only person I'm having sex with is Gabi.<eos> Exactly. She's the only employee in this house involved in your itch.<eos> Hold up, wait a second, Elliot.<eos> Josh, Gabi didn't give you an STD.<eos> Yes, she did.
I let them down.<eos> - I let Jessica down.<eos> - I know you feel...<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Because either Flynn was lying to me about who killed my wife, or he wasn't, and fate wanted her dead anyway.<eos> Wrap your head around that for a minute, that the universe... or God... wanted the one person that I love most in this world... to be dead.<eos> Maybe the universe is saying there's something else you have to do first.<eos> Maybe you're not meant to be here.<eos> Maybe you're meant to be helping your friends.<eos> How do I do that now?
Chalk one up for the underdogs.<eos> Good news. The writ was denied.<eos> The video is in.<eos> Except you're not going to use it.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Why?<eos> Personal experience has taught me military secrets should stay secret.<eos> With all due respect, just because you served in Vietnam doesn't give you a monopoly on national security protocol.<eos> In my office, it does.
Mr. Stone?<eos> Peter.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Came to pay my respects.<eos> Could've done that at the house.<eos> There's also something I thought you should know about Trevor.<eos> If it's something I'd rather not hear...<eos> The Navy didn't tell you the truth about Omega.<eos> Trevor didn't either.
Baracus prosecuted Weckler's BE arrest when he was an ADA.<eos> He got his patsy, now he needs leverage, which he gets when he finds out that Weckler has a daughter.<eos> So Baracus turns Tatum into a zombie, promises to keep her in brains as long as Weckler steals the memory card for him.<eos> Weckler screws up, he kills Roxanne, and so Baracus gets a prison guard to kill Weckler.<eos> Then Baracus gets that same prison guard thrown overboard, off a cruise ship.<eos> I buy the blackmail, but I'm not sure Baracus is a serial killer.<eos> He is definitely mixed up in this.<eos> - And I just voted for him.<eos> - So did I.<eos> All right, we did it!
I think you'll really love it.<eos> I didn't get you anything.<eos> Oh, that's okay. Having you close is enough.<eos> This is for you.<eos> - I don't feel comfortable accepting that.<eos> - What? I said I didn't get you anything.<eos> It's okay, it's Christmas.<eos> I'm just feeling, um... suffocated.<eos> What with the gifts and the letters, and you saying you missed me.<eos> - I did...
- I did...<eos> I did miss you. - Well, I didn't ask you to.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Did... did something happen?<eos> It was the letter I wrote, wasn't it?<eos> I want to stop that, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I can't be the guy waiting around for letters or writing words that I don't mean.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I don't.
But she doesn't need us.<eos> A skydiving company should give their clients parachutes that, you know, open.<eos> It's no slam dunk.<eos> The governor signed a liability waiver.<eos> Yeah, and the waiver can be broken if Liberty proves either gross negligence or willful misconduct.<eos> We both know how clever she is.<eos> She'll be able to get past the waiver.<eos> Not worried about Liberty.<eos> Well, then, why would she need our help?<eos> She doesn't.
We have to trust S now more than ever.<eos> So what am I meant to do in Switzerland, then? Hmm?<eos> I need to be here for Kira, and I have an art opening in three weeks.<eos> The boys have been digging.<eos> There are at least six different subsidiaries of Neolution registered in Switzerland.<eos> So we start there.<eos> - Follow the money.<eos> - Adele needs you.<eos> You're a quick study. You're a survivor.<eos> We do this as a family.
I don't think I can hold this.<eos> Okay, you know something, I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Danny. Seems like a good idea.<eos> Your concern for him must be affecting your concentration and balance.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Officer Kalakaua, can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you believe that there's a thin line between love and hate?<eos> Because the way that you were laying into me back there, that was so over the top,<eos> I was like, Wow, maybe she likes me.<eos> I don't.
Again, his name is Kingsley.<eos> Look, here comes Mickey.<eos> Let's just keep this between us, okay?<eos> I want to keep capitalizing on this Guatemalan thing. Part of my brand.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Plus, I want to rub it in her face - that we've been hanging out.<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> I won't mention you said that word a bunch of times.<eos> Hey, Mickey. Did you know that the national bird of Guatemala is the Quetzal?<eos> 'Cause I do.
And what do you do?<eos> You just swat 'em away!<eos> You swat every single one of them away, and then you're all confused about what happened?<eos> Oh, you stupid child. You know, I... I think the real lesson here is that it's easy to brand all adult entertainers as untrustworthy crooks.<eos> But if you really want to know the truth, it's women in general that cannot be trusted.<eos> You're one to talk.<eos> What?<eos> Kai didn't come to bed last night, okay?<eos> I know you didn't break up with him.<eos> Yeah, I did, last night in the sauna.
Enough with the pepper grinder.<eos> We're gonna come up with a plan, and we're gonna find Ben.<eos> - Yeah. But I just got the...<eos> - Chip. - Fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got to find him.<eos> Uh, does this bus go to River Sun Casino?<eos> Do you have the fare?<eos> I have these.<eos> It does now.
Is this, is this that gambling is good?<eos> That does not feel right.<eos> You know, maybe it is, um, don't ever give up.<eos> Or play till you win?<eos> Uh, it just kind of seems like she shouldn't have won.<eos> Uh, yeah, but I did.<eos> I did win, you know, so maybe the lesson is there is no lesson.<eos> It's just life. You know?<eos> Just sort of happens.<eos> Yeah, it does.
What about the police?<eos> They're expecting a gunshot victim.<eos> And we're gonna give 'em one.<eos> So, are you gonna do this, or what?<eos> Yeah, I just... I... It's hard to shoot a man in the back.<eos> I've been taught better than that.<eos> This man... - hit you. Whoa!<eos> - Aah. - He hit you with a car.<eos> - I know, and he felt so bad.<eos> - He did it twice.
They're expecting a gunshot victim.<eos> And we're gonna give 'em one.<eos> So, are you gonna do this, or what?<eos> Yeah, I just... I...

Whoa!<eos> - Aah. - He hit you with a car.<eos> - I know, and he felt so bad.<eos> - He did it twice.<eos> - He did, didn't he?
Didn't know you were in here.<eos> I just came to tuck Ben in.<eos> Well, that's very thoughtful of you, - but I think I can manage.<eos> You should know though that there's, like, a whole routine now.<eos> Yeah, of course. Starts by killing all the monsters in the closet.<eos> Well, that is the obvious first step.<eos> And I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, but it-it doesn't hurt to check.<eos> Am I right, Ben?<eos> Oh, Ben! A huge monster!<eos> What do I do?
Yeah. We're lucky that grenade wasn't inside me.<eos> It could have been really bad.<eos> Obviously, we'll have to charge you for this.<eos> Look, I'm gonna pass on the surgery.<eos> Just take it out of that.<eos> You are?<eos> I don't want the memory of today physically attached to my body.<eos> I'll hold off for now.<eos> So my plan worked.<eos> It did not.
It's about your brother, Al Capone.<eos> Look. I don't know who you people think I am.<eos> You're Jimmy Capone, born James Vincenzo Capone.<eos> My name's Richard Hart.<eos> You left Brooklyn when you were 16 and changed your name for a fresh start, and wound up becoming a Prohibition Agent.<eos> And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name. Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
If this news gets out, it'll be pandemonium.<eos> Just examine the scene, then scrub it.<eos> You mean cover it up?<eos> Tomato, potato.<eos> Earp?<eos> - Restocking already?<eos> - They say liquor sells itself.<eos> Bet the sight of you pouring' it don't hurt either.<eos> How does our latest cocktail progress?<eos> - It doesn't.
Most people think of heartless killers when they hear the term, but 95% of sociopaths are highly successful in all kinds of careers.<eos> Lack of empathy allows them to excel.<eos> But he seemed affected when he was talking about the building collapse.<eos> Withrow learned to mimic emotion.<eos> When I asked him about the deaths in his building, his micro expressions... the slight wincing of his eye muscles, the convex furrow of his left brow, and the f-f-forced micro stutter, they all came a hair late, and not in perfect unison.<eos> It was mimicry, not sympathy.<eos> It was a good tactic, bringing in Diana.<eos> What?<eos> Nobody said anything about Diana's bewitching effect on you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
Bobby Burrows was your CI?<eos> He was after we let him scoot.<eos> See, this is where it all gets confusing.<eos> Um, you gotta admit, it's a hell of a coincidence that your CI's father is also a witness in a shooting that you're investigating.<eos> If you're accusing us of something, spit it out.<eos> Cool it, Stevie, they're just doing their jobs.<eos> We did good by Jerry's kid.<eos> He trusted us.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Of course he does.
Well, I got a pretty good idea.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's my house.<eos> - That's in Edgebrook, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
Come on, ladies.<eos> Está bien. Estás seguro.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Are you Mrs. Brossette?<eos> Amelia?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your husband's gonna be very happy to see you.<eos> No, Pride did not toss him overboard.<eos> Oh, yes, he did.
Well... I know. But, I just...<eos> I thought that I could talk to him myself and see what he says.<eos> Was this Emma's idea? No.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I just...<eos> I need to prove that I can do something on my own.<eos> You know?<eos> Callie, look. I know I'm not your parent. All right, but I want to help.<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - Well, we do.
I needed a safe place to knock the crap out of people and not get arrested, so I joined the junior team.<eos> - Your parents were cool with that?<eos> - No way. See, girls aren't supposed to be aggressive.<eos> We're taught to keep it all inside.<eos> But in derby, I get to unleash my beast.<eos> Be fearless.<eos> Must be nice to have somewhere to let go.<eos> You don't need permission.<eos> I just... I with I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
- Wow. - Thank you.<eos> - Like father, like daughter.<eos> - Oh, hardly.<eos> Lena, what do you do?<eos> Uh, I am the vice principal for the, uh, Anchor Beach Community Charter.<eos> - Everything here is great.<eos> - Kind of expensive.<eos> Oh, I'm paying. Don't worry.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, very much.<eos> They look realistic?<eos> I mean, as a taxpayer, do they look professionally done?<eos> As a taxpayer, yes.<eos> Look, you got clear, clean lines.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You got a lot of detail in there.<eos> Look how cute you made me.<eos> You know I'm always gonna take care of you, right?<eos> You always do, Sis.
The solitude.<eos> Since my daughter, and... and then my marriage fell apart, it's-it's easier.<eos> Some days I don't even have the energy to deal with people.<eos> I... I like my alone time, too.<eos> I thought I could handle it.<eos> I mean, I thought that I was ready for her.<eos> And then there she was, and I just...<eos> Alicia, it'll get better. You know, it's gonna take time, but it'll get better.<eos> Yeah, 'cause time heals all ills, right?<eos> Except it doesn't really.
All right. I'll check on the BOLO.<eos> I know that you and Alicia have history.<eos> You go back, you almost died together, I get it.<eos> - There's a lot there. It's heavy.<eos> - Now you think... you think that prevents me from being objective about her, right?<eos> No, I-I just think there are certain possibilities that we have to consider.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like that this woman, Alicia, just snapped. Okay?<eos> She lost her daughter... You think you ever get over something like that?<eos> You don't.
Excuse me. - What is the nature of terror in America?<eos> What and who should we fear and why?<eos> This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack<eos> - from a more confident GOP.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?<eos> How does this fit in to their endgame?<eos> Could just be a terrorist attack.<eos> - And we don't know it was them.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Because emergency medicine isn't really what I do.<eos> Wait. What do you do?<eos> I normally deal with dead bodies.<eos> Well, you take much longer, you may have another one on your hands.<eos> No, I think this'll be, uh, the last for awhile.<eos> Are you feeling dizzy?<eos> Any nausea?<eos> Only when I drink tequila.<eos> I'm trying to establish whether or not you have a concussion.<eos> I don't.
So I told them, if that jackass won't pay for his wife, maybe he will pay for his girlfriend.<eos> Oh... Oh, my God.<eos> So I hope, for both of our sakes, that you are lying, and that Tom cares a lot more for you than he does for me.<eos> No. To me, that could be any one of a dozen brands.<eos> Nope.<eos> See over there?<eos> Only Kona has that kind of detail on the label.<eos> Well, clearly, I am in the presence of a craft beer savant. Hey, yo.<eos> We got something?<eos> Oh, we sure do.
It's a small liberal arts college in Ohio.<eos> - Garcia. - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm here for you, sir.<eos> Cochrane university in Ohio.<eos> What's the out-of-state tuition?<eos> Uh, yikes. $37,000 annually.<eos> That's not taking into consideration books, cost of living, ramen, beer kegs, bean bag chairs, et cetera.<eos> Joey Fletcher's family didn't have anywhere near that kind of money.<eos> How did he pay for it?<eos> He didn't.
Sure. Of course.<eos> Just go easy on my firewall, would you?<eos> I got you, Sean.<eos> Owen and Alex got Sean's finger-scan.<eos> As soon as it gets to you, log into their system and download their trade history.<eos> Already on it.<eos> Plan trade data coming in.<eos> Alex, I've put us on closed comms.<eos> I got an answer from Keyes about the recruit Leon mentioned who died in the car crash.<eos> They didn't.
Of course I am.<eos> What, you think they'd tell you?<eos> I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.<eos> She said it happened right after The Farm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry... I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Okay.<eos> You know how I can get ahold of her?<eos> No, we have no contact.<eos> Not even a cell phone?<eos> Security?<eos> No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Remember that?<eos> That's what this place stands for.<eos> But that's something you obviously don't get.<eos> You're a failure, Cabral, a failure to yourself, and this institution.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself!<eos> Do I have permission to fire?<eos> You think you got the balls?<eos> Go ahead, pull the trigger!<eos> Shoot me!<eos> No, but I do.
Yes, he did.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't you move.<eos> Bryce, Bryce, listen to your wife.<eos> Dr. Ken didn't kill Roller.<eos> He was with me that night.<eos> Bryce, he only got the gun because he was afraid of being robbed.<eos> Shut up, all right?<eos> He had Roller's passcodes.<eos> Everybody did.
They hurt us!<eos> They shouldn't be here!<eos> This... This... This is our home!<eos> Baby, we can't control where anybody else lives!<eos> But... But... But come down and let's talk about this.<eos> Virginia was asking about you!<eos> Virginia was...?<eos> No!<eos> You're lying!<eos> No, she didn't!
This state loves us.<eos> Now get the hell out.<eos> Come on, Des.<eos> Don't touch my sister!<eos> Don't touch my sister!<eos> Don't touch...<eos> Let's go, Des.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Why does evil always win?<eos> Dean, it doesn't, okay?
No, that's not true!<eos> You don't protect me, I protected you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, no, don't tell her, Dean.<eos> You can't tell her.<eos> Dean, don't tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...
You don't protect me, I protected you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, no, don't tell her, Dean.<eos> You can't tell her.<eos> Dean, don't tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you...
Try to get them little eyes to light up, but...<eos> - Clay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> We just got a call.<eos> We got a lead on Roller's killers.<eos> Take care of it.<eos> Done.<eos> Hey, y'all.<eos> Morning, babe.<eos> How you doing?
If there's something inside that could help us help him, you really want us to waste time getting a warrant?<eos> I can see how you couldn't tell there was a break-in.<eos> This is drywall dust.<eos> These are drips of paint.<eos> They don't match the walls.<eos> Gonna take a wild guess here and say Darren was stealing valuables from his drywall jobs.<eos> Probably fencing them, too, which is why he could afford a second home.<eos> You sure nothing's missing?<eos> I was telling the truth, I honestly don't know.<eos> I do.
He chose that life, I didn't.<eos> I got to get to class.<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you guys want from me?<eos> And what makes you think I had the Lady Frances?<eos> You lent it to Joshua Chris when you were courting him to sign with you.<eos> Oh. Where did you get that cock-and-bull story from?<eos> Joshua Chris.<eos> He might've been willing to keep your secret back then, but I got the sense from the call with him that things did not end well between you.<eos> They didn't.
But I need it tonight.<eos> That sting created a time issue for my partner.<eos> He's blaming me for the lost shipment, wants double his money back.<eos> Didn't think the great King had a partner.<eos> Lately, he's been thinking that he's the one that's in charge, making demands.<eos> It's disrespectful, and, frankly, it's time for him to go.<eos> So what are you saying? You want me to take care of him for you?<eos> (chuckles) It has to be me.<eos> You, you're gonna help me get the cash and deliver it. And then I'm gonna kill him.<eos> You do that,
Who knows how many?<eos> But I think it would be better if Officer Kalakaua went in alone.<eos> Yes, of course, I understand.<eos> Kelsey?<eos> I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Check previous addresses, known associates.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Right.<eos> We need Harley Quinn.<eos> Last I heard, Harley went off the grid after she got out on parole.<eos> No one's heard a thing since.<eos> Rumor is she's gone straight, but also, just plain gone.<eos> No one disappears without a trace.<eos> Someone knows something.<eos> Someone always does.
Am I the only one keeping an eye out for the lost Ark of the Covenant?<eos> Nah, that's in a warehouse in Yemen.<eos> I was joking.<eos> So was I.<eos> Crate 10997...<eos> Last earthly possessions of Milton Barker.<eos> Or at least the last earthly possessions that weren't stolen by Travis Unger.<eos> Says here Mr. Barker was an insurance adjustor, died of a stroke, age 86, no known heirs.<eos> So, how do you open this?<eos> I don't.
Thanks.<eos> That'll do the trick.<eos> The National Weather Service says they'll send us the last two months of satellite footage covering the coordinates Mr. Vestergaard gave us.<eos> Should be easy enough to spot a vessel which anchored above the Santa Leticia long enough to loot her.<eos> Keep me posted, would you?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The respite I mentioned last night?<eos> It's over.<eos> You know I don't like it when you do this.<eos> Nobody does.
That's just where we have dinner.<eos> Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.<eos> So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start.<eos> H-Howard.<eos> Flashback sounds.<eos> Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sure you do.
Just trust me.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When are El Santo's people showing up?<eos> I love this song.<eos> What are you doing, Leo?<eos> _<eos> You think I don't know who you are, hmm?<eos> You think you took him from me?<eos> You didn't. You didn't.
He's not stupid.<eos> He's stalling.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> And then I want you to take care of Guero.<eos> Just keep Teresa out of it.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I should have told you about Leo.<eos> She's still in love with you.<eos> Well, that don't excuse what she did.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Do you understand there's no way we can distribute this amount?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you understand that if we don't get that first payment, a fleet of El Santo's hit men are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas.<eos> El Santo gave us no choice.<eos> I don't remember asking you a damn thing.<eos> He said take a metric ton or nothing.<eos> I understand it put us in danger.<eos> So why'd you do it?<eos> Because now you have a choice.<eos> With nothing, you don't.
Learned it at camp.<eos> Okay, that's not a pellet gun.<eos> Your brother-in-law, really should have found a better hiding place.<eos> Listen, Anna. If it's the keys to the car you're looking for, they're in my pocket.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> We are way past that.<eos> I'm really sorry, Anna.<eos> You know, none of this was supposed to happen.<eos> But it did.
Ok. Maybe you think you saw her...<eos> Her father's Jack Vaughn, former hit man for the Irish mob.<eos> He and Lindsey were in Witness Protection.<eos> Lindsey and her friend Katie were abducted,<eos> Katie was killed, and Jack murdered the unsub in front of me.<eos> Kill him.<eos> When does it stop?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Do you honestly not remember any of this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Mom, it's true.<eos> Henry, you have to accept these things are not real.<eos> And bringing me to some rooftop is not gonna convince me that my mother is Snow White.<eos> But she is.<eos> And this isn't just some rooftop.<eos> This is where you married your true love yesterday.<eos> My true love?<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.
She'll find David.<eos> She always does.<eos> Well, we have a problem.<eos> What the devil happened to it? Emma.<eos> Her lack of belief.<eos> It's sapping the magic from everything here.<eos> Well, can't you fix it? Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I'm... I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
- You don't have to protect me anymore.<eos> - I don't know how to stop.<eos> Look, the prosecutors are reviewing your case.<eos> Any of this might lead the way to a... reduced sentence.<eos> I made some mistakes, Cam.<eos> I never set out to hurt anyone.<eos> And then I got in too deep before I could make the investors whole again.<eos> I'm just so embarrassed for you to see me like this.<eos> I deserve to be in jail for what I did.<eos> But not for what you didn't.
You know, that's the warmest memory you ever shared with me.<eos> And later that night, I stuck it through a possum's head that was eatin' my mother's garden.<eos> Look, Rooster'll come around.<eos> Colt did. Just be there to welcome him.<eos> Oh, I realize I'm saying this to a man who once referred to Rudolph as an affirmative action case.<eos> You know, first, Rooster doesn't want to be part of this ranch.<eos> Now he doesn't want to be part of this family.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> He'll come back.<eos> Colt did.
You lie.<eos> Tell them they won, they saved the day, and that Senator Baynard's gonna get his.<eos> I've watched my mother's career closely.<eos> I-I know what happens when you lie.<eos> You end up having to cover it up with another and another...<eos> Or you learn to live with them.<eos> Listen... You want to be a good leader?<eos> Let your soldiers believe in their success.<eos> - And when they find out the truth?<eos> - Maybe they never do.
If you leave without me, I will not be here when you come back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The wedding is not a problem.<eos> I must admit, I was a little surprised not to be asked to serve on the board of your Ranker.<eos> It's called The Roster.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's probably why I wasn't asked.<eos> The Roster, it's very tech-centered, and, well, you're famous for...<eos> Hating the Internet.<eos> I do.
- Erica?<eos> - Guess again.<eos> - Todd?<eos> - Not today.<eos> - Jasper spoke? !<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> Carol, that's everyone.<eos> Did you say Gail?<eos> Yes, I did.
Chelsea?<eos> Chief, we're all clear here.<eos> Chelsea, we're here to help.<eos> You can't.<eos> I promise you we can.<eos> - Your parents...<eos> - You don't know anything about me!<eos> You're right, Chelsea.<eos> I don't.<eos> But she does.
Well...<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have, like, a bathroom or something?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just down the hall.<eos> Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
Anyway, um, just give me a shout if you're having any problems.<eos> So I hear they went zip-lining in Costa Rica.<eos> I thought it was South America somewhere.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Daniel?<eos> I went and had drinks with Bert about a month ago, and, you know, he let it slip.<eos> A month ago?<eos> And you've just been sitting on this?<eos> Well, I kinda thought it was more up to Bert to tell you, and I advised him to do exactly that.<eos> Yeah, well, he didn't.
It's a big one.<eos> Lord.<eos> Like the time you asked me to take a picture of your hemorrhoids when we was in Cancún?<eos> First of all, how you dare you?<eos> No, how dare you?<eos> That itch and burn was so fierce!<eos> 'Cause you ain't right!<eos> I tried to get my own phone back there to take a picture.<eos> Don't act like you don't like it.<eos> No, I did not.
- My God.<eos> Nice to meet you, and congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - They're so good.<eos> You girls know what?<eos> This would make a perfect look for a bachelorette party.<eos> Yes!<eos> Bridesmaids, take note!<eos> Um, where did you get these done?<eos> Actually, I did them myself.
You're alive.<eos> We did this.<eos> We did not do this.<eos> We set the Coombses up to be killed.<eos> No, we set them up to go to jail.<eos> This was done by Uncle Daddy's corrupt popo.<eos> Pol, this was done by Bryce.<eos> Because Uncle Daddy forced him to do it.<eos> Listen, you guys, we didn't know any of this was gonna happen, okay?<eos> But it did.
Yeah.<eos> Go, Dean.<eos> Go, Dean.<eos> Don't get bashful now.<eos> The Coombses are dead.<eos> What?<eos> It was on the news this morning.<eos> They were part of a drug ring, yeah.<eos> They got what they deserved.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Previously on "Claws"...<eos> We set the Coombses up to be killed.<eos> No, we set them up to go to jail.<eos> Listen, You guys, we didn't know any of this was gonna happen, okay?<eos> But it did.
Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Is this really you, baby?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes.<eos> We all thought you died.<eos> We did. W... Everybody was so upset.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I don't remember nothin'.<eos> You don't?
Shit.<eos> I like.<eos> What color this is?<eos> Um... it's Teatro.<eos> I didn't know that was your business, Riva.<eos> Well, now you do.<eos> I was just trying to see what Roller was up to.<eos> He said it was your people that tried to kill him.<eos> He say we try to assassinate him?<eos> He did. He sure did.
Give me that quarter.<eos> Okay, you're three hours away from anyone who knows you.<eos> Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> Help you what?<eos> I'm not a lawyer.<eos> And my sister doesn't need one since she didn't do anything.<eos> She hasn't even been charged.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Your boss does.
Roarke calling for the truth?<eos> As much as it pains me to say this publicly,<eos> I have seen evidence that Claire Haas covered up what truly happened in the G20 hostage crisis.<eos> She knew the threat was imminent, and yet she turned a blind eye.<eos> And when it was over, she covered it up, and all for one reason.<eos> She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
Like she's not gonna be having nightmares for the rest of her life.<eos> Yeah, well, she got a good story to tell now.<eos> I stashed the ambulance behind the house.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> His ventilator's almost out of juice, so we had to plug it into an outlet.<eos> Good job.<eos> What? I plugged a thing into a thing.<eos> I don't mean that specifically. In general, good job.<eos> You didn't have to, um...<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
All right, great.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> Hey, so, I just spoke to, Steve.<eos> Dario Mendez... they got him on conspiracy.<eos> He's locked up now, so...<eos> He can still give orders from behind bars.<eos> That's why we're moving Makino tomorrow to the secure ward at King's.<eos> It's funny.<eos> The head of the Ochoa cartel was so paranoid to think someone who's been asleep for seven years is gonna bring him down.<eos> But in a way, he did.
Its admirable how dedicated you are.<eos> See? We're not so different.<eos> We both sacrifice for what we believe is right, Kurt.<eos> That's why I wanted you for our new government.<eos> You're dedicated, you're honorable.<eos> I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come on, come on, little decoy, connect, connect.<eos> Patterson, did it work?<eos> No.<eos> Patterson!<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's working.<eos> The decoy just rerouted.<eos> It's working!<eos> Weller, we did it.
- Everybody loved him.<eos> When was the last time you saw Richie?<eos> Last night.<eos> We had dinner at Rosebud.<eos> Okay.<eos> - How did he seem?<eos> - Good.<eos> Happy.<eos> He was talking about which dorm he wanted at New Haven, right? Did he say where he was going after dinner?<eos> He didn't.
- And why is that?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> He's 14. He's scared.<eos> Come on, Hank.<eos> Look, Lavar Spann is the bigger catch.<eos> He brainwashed and recruited these kids.<eos> He orchestrated these robberies.<eos> We've been through this, Sergeant.<eos> - You don't have anything on...<eos> - Yes, we do.
Erin has a deal, and it blows up as soon as these become evidence.<eos> Does she know?<eos> No one knows. No one can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> 'Cause I promise you... the second you put her in jeopardy,<eos> I tried to be a good mother to her.<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> You don't.
It's been real.<eos> Time's up.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Wait.<eos> No waiting.<eos> Pencils down.<eos> Pencils down!<eos> Um, what does it take to pass?<eos> 75.<eos> And if we don't?
You know nothing about my life.<eos> I work two jobs to support my son.<eos> I am gone from 6:00 a.m. 00 at night.<eos> You have no right to judge.<eos> I would do anything to protect him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Please explain the course of treatment.<eos> Mr. Halstead, I'm Sharon Goodwin, executive director of patient and medical services.<eos> I thought I should say hello.<eos> Well, how you doing?
That firewall was really throwing a wrench into it.<eos> That game was for me and Woz. And occasionally Bezos and Shakira.<eos> Electronic wire fraud.<eos> Identify theft.<eos> Seven years in a federal lockup for hacking a telecom data vault.<eos> Why didn't you tell us your security chief,<eos> Lazlo Simms, had a mile-long record, which, apparently, you paid to have expunged?<eos> We all have things in our past we wish we could wash away.<eos> Laz is the only person in the world I completely trust.<eos> He didn't do this.
You're gonna get us killed.<eos> Listen to your friend.<eos> 9-1-1, my professor, his place is trashed.<eos> There were big scary goons staking out his house.<eos> They chased my ass across town.<eos> We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
You all right?<eos> - Let me out of the car! - Stop!<eos> Stop! Stop.<eos> Oh, God, it was you?<eos> You're the mole.<eos> Karissa, I can't raise Liam or Nelson on the phone.<eos> Tracking them.<eos> Their signals are... dead.<eos> When did they check in at the offsite facility?<eos> They didn't.
♪ ♪ I'm gonna put on my runnin' shoes. ♪<eos> His plan is to put on shoes?<eos> 'Cause my plan is to monitor the fetal heartbeat, time your contractions, and measure your dilation.<eos> So you're not gonna wear shoes?<eos> I'm gonna wear friggin' shoes.<eos> Carol, do you still want me to deliver this baby?<eos> Of course. But how am I gonna tell him?<eos> You just do it.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Yeah, just do it.
Tandy, can you take Jasper to the park?<eos> Yes.<eos> But what about the waters?<eos> Really liking the park idea.<eos> Say no more, big guy.<eos> Jasper, you ready, child?<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> "Carol Andrew Pilbasian Miller," loving wife, devoted friend, died in childbirth "after a torturous, protracted, bloody labor."<eos> Yeah. You're not writing a damn obituary.<eos> No, newspapers do it in advance all the time.
And once it's done, he won't be able to get out.<eos> Since my life is on the line, I just have to know... what are the Russians giving you for this?<eos> They're not giving us anything.<eos> We're using them to take Roarke out.<eos> How can you be so sure this will work?<eos> The Russians could do anything with that intelligence.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't. Okay? You don't.
Led by you, of course.<eos> Everyone was equally invested.<eos> So, what are your plans after this?<eos> The rest I can throw on a shelf somewhere, but you...<eos> Too many questions if you disappeared, so... academia?<eos> A think tank?<eos> It's none of your concern.<eos> "It's none of your concern, sir."<eos> You don't have to respect me, but at least respect the office.<eos> I do.
If you're expecting an apology, you're not gonna get it.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> What the hell do you want from me?<eos> You want to have a-a talk about America?<eos> You want to give me a lecture about your superior virtues?<eos> What is the point of all this?<eos> !<eos> Why am I being kept in here...<eos> - Henry...<eos> - like I did something wrong?
Thanks for organising the plaque, Will.<eos> The epitaph, it's beautiful.<eos> They were Bea's words... it's what she used to tell Debbie as a kid.<eos> A sudden death like this puts things in perspective, - doesn't it?<eos> I'm lifting your suspension.<eos> Why?<eos> Now's a time for us to pull together.<eos> You can come back at the start of next week's roster.<eos> That's if you want to come back.<eos> Yes, I do.
It was like she knew.<eos> - Knew what?<eos> - What Ferguson did to me.<eos> - How'd she get out?<eos> - You tell me!<eos> - Vera?<eos> - She let Smith out to get to me.<eos> I'm lifting your suspension.<eos> - That's if you want to come back.<eos> - Yes, I do.
All right, come on.<eos> Remember what happened to the last person who lost their swipe card.<eos> What the fuck are you doing? !<eos> Give me one good reason why I shouldn't report you?<eos> I'm a good root.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> Oh, you think this is funny do you?<eos> Not to mention, getting Novak to do your dirty work.<eos> What if someone else had caught you with my card? ! I would lose my job!<eos> Yeah, but they didn't, did they?
Couple of weeks ago, I went to see a new doctor.<eos> He confirmed what the first one said, my rotator cuff is no good.<eos> I got the MRI to prove it.<eos> So you got another doctor to lie for you.<eos> So what?<eos> Well, this new guy, he's the one the department would ask to examine me if you try to mess with my pension.<eos> Turns out I'm not the first ex-cop that he's seen with my... condition.<eos> You mean you're not the first cop who was willing to pay him more.<eos> Whatever you thought you had on me, made you think you could push me around?<eos> You don't.

Oh, yeah... I mean, no... n... not really, I...<eos> that whole time was... - it was a bit of a blur.<eos> - Mm-hm, so is that a yes or a no?<eos> No.<eos> It's bull, Novak.<eos> You know exactly who it is.<eos> You told Proctor.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I can't remember.<eos> - Yes you do.
All down to poor management skills and an utter lack of leadership, I'd say.<eos> Well, at least it's not on fire.- -<eos> How do you know Mike Pennisi?<eos> Who?<eos> These are my posts. How did you get them?<eos> I got permission to access the net to prove that chick provoked you.<eos> You got influence.<eos> This guy.<eos> - How do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
! - He was obsessed with you! He even had a shrine to you all over the wall.<eos> You don't touch this! - Ugh!<eos> - Aagh! Get off!<eos> - You destroyed us!<eos> - Don't touch any of this!<eos> Mike is dead because of you.<eos> - I didn't kill Mike!<eos> - No.<eos> Mike?<eos> I did!
Goodness me, there is such a glow about you.<eos> What is that?<eos> Don't tell me, you're in love.<eos> Oh, that is so sweet.<eos> At least it would be, if it weren't all based on a lie.<eos> Hate to be the one to break it to you though, Vera, but you and, um, your Jakey? Nothing about it is real.<eos> It's fiction.<eos> Everything Jake has said, everything he's done, it was all at my instruction.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
We're going to be arrested.<eos> And there's nothing Reddington can do to protect us against that.<eos> To be honest, that's what makes me the angriest.<eos> That here we are at the end, and we still don't know why he walked into your life that day.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To do something I should've done a long time ago.<eos> Once Kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.<eos> Cooper tried to shut it down.<eos> Harold has to work within the system.<eos> Henry Prescott does not.
I was told it was still here.<eos> Guess it should be here then.<eos> Just go on right over there.<eos> 475-6826-B.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> Look, I did the best I could.<eos> I don't know how long he's gonna last.<eos> I hear, like, these little gurgling noises<eos> - when he breathes.<eos> - You did fine, JayJay.
I keep thinking that I did something that took me 60 years to do.<eos> I did it at a time when the cost was very low.<eos> What could I lose?<eos> Work?<eos> Very unlikely.<eos> I already had enough capital in professional respect.<eos> I could have lost something.<eos> "Oh, let's not hire that transvestite."<eos> It could have happened.<eos> But it didn't.
I have made my peace with Wyatt.<eos> Now you can go to Hell.<eos> For Wyatt, I would.<eos> I would ride to Hell and back for him if need be.<eos> Used to be you would too.<eos> Good day, sir.<eos> Of course I don't have it yet.<eos> So I could probably get shot and I would be OK.<eos> Unless... if you die in your dream, do you die in real life?<eos> What do I do?
No.<eos> And he never will be.<eos> How dare you talk back to your father?<eos> No.<eos> You're not my father.<eos> Yes, I am!<eos> No, you're not!<eos> Whaaaaa?<eos> Ashi, you have Aku's powers.<eos> I do!
I put it to you, Mr Hasan, when the odds peaked, this person in the stands gave you a signal.<eos> What person?<eos> And you in turn communicated this to Oliver.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Who gave you the signal, Mr Hasan?<eos> - No one.<eos> There was no signal.<eos> - So, why was your house firebombed?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - Well, I do.
Can you give it to him, Mummy?<eos> Of course. He's gonna love that.<eos> I love it.<eos> Maybe next time you can draw a special picture for Bianca.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> All right, it's bedtime.<eos> Liam, bedtime.<eos> - I need to finish this level.<eos> - No, you don't.
Well, I'm not answering any more questions.<eos> Well, I hope you brought your toothbrush, because you'll be in custody until your cooperation is full and complete.<eos> Okay, alright.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> I mean, that... that was Eddie.<eos> I just did what he said.<eos> - Who else was involved?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you know who asked Eddie to provide the players with that supplement?<eos> No, I don't.
How dare you threaten me with that?<eos> That's your choice.<eos> So, the only real question you've gotta ask yourself is this... who do you love more?<eos> Yourself... or your son?<eos> Ms Reynolds?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, given the number of times you've called each other, we find that unbelievable.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't.
No, it's more like he wants to prove something.<eos> Yes, well, as long as he doesn't say 'yes' as an intellectual exercise and then back off when things start to get dicey.<eos> He won't.<eos> Maybe it's the wrong option.<eos> Richard IS the only option.<eos> Inside Darren's house is fully covered now.<eos> Cars, phones, plus his in-laws, family, all their phones too.<eos> All ready for take-off.<eos> - ...did I authorise this?<eos> - She did.
Richie?<eos> For a coffee.<eos> I urge you to take our questions very seriously, Mr Faulkes.<eos> Don't quote the Crimes Act at me, mate.<eos> I win every time. What the hell's going on?<eos> ! Apologies for barging into your fiefdom, Mr Examiner, but you'll have to stand that witness down.<eos> What?<eos> And this hearing needs to stop immediately.<eos> The state DPP has no jurisdiction over the National Crime Commission.<eos> But we do.
I can.<eos> Or maybe you've stopped trying.<eos> I've stopped trying?<eos> You've been here, what, a month?<eos> And you'll probably be gone in another month.<eos> I've been here three years and I'm never leaving.<eos> So don't tell me I've stopped trying.<eos> I just meant...<eos> No, that you're an American who has choices.<eos> These people don't, and neither do I.
My sponsor.<eos> And he brought me a drink.<eos> And you took it.<eos> I'm sorry, Scott.<eos> I know this brings up all kinds of issues, but you have to take responsibility.<eos> Please don't quote program to me.<eos> Maybe you need to have the program quoted to you.<eos> Look, if you don't wanna do the surgery because it cuts too close to home, then fine.<eos> But you have to at least talk to him.<eos> - No, I don't.
Look, Ms. Gardner...<eos> I know this is a very difficult time for you right now, but when you're ready, of course -<eos> Tucker was associating himself with a couple of women that we've been looking for...<eos> - Just get water. Water. Water.<eos> - Yes. OK. - Yep.<eos> Hey.<eos> Am I the biggest cliché ever?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> Of course you do.
I hit three other strip clubs!<eos> Three!<eos> Huh? - Hey, you OK?<eos> - No, she's not because that guy might be the... with...<eos> So what do we do with him?<eos> Take him for a ride.<eos> So... tell me what you do to piss somebody off so bad<eos> - that they're still after you.<eos> - Could be the Pinkertons, could be Silver Cowboys Gang, could be Dave!<eos> - So what did you do?
Same damn thing.<eos> - Wynonna... - Hmm?<eos> This baby, what is it?<eos> Ours.<eos> - Is it gonna leave a mark?<eos> - Nah, it's superficial.<eos> - You had no plan out there, huh?<eos> - Oh, I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why? Did you?
Running towards a cliff, terrified of jumping, but...<eos> Well, if it's right, you don't think about the cliff because you're sure when you reach the edge, you'll fly.<eos> If you go off a cliff, don't you die?<eos> He's outside.<eos> - Thanks for this.<eos> - Thanks for lunch.<eos> You gonna eat those pickles?<eos> What?<eos> - You don't like 'em.<eos> - Well, I do now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You were doing it.<eos> Oh. Again?<eos> What kind of dream was it?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I don't remember my dreams.<eos> - You don't?
Hey, you didn't call me last night.<eos> Was I supposed to?<eos> Ah, to yell at me for springing my mother on you.<eos> Why?<eos> I liked her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you don't have to say that.<eos> - I know my mother.<eos> - Really?<eos> Do you?
But part of the addiction... the obsessiveness... is what makes you so successful.<eos> Uh-huh. Your addictionisn't a weakness, Scott.<eos> And it's starving.<eos> You need a way to feed your need without using drugs or alcohol.<eos> I have no idea where you're going with this.<eos> I know what I feel coming off of you, Scott.<eos> It's hunger.<eos> And there are a lot of healthy and fun ways to satisfy it... if you're interested.<eos> Do you have an extra key?<eos> I do.
For twenty years have I served you and God as the Archbishop to Targoviste Cathedral.<eos> Yet never before have I felt the love of God shine so upon this great city.<eos> A little more than one year ago, many of us suffered a vision during the God-willed punishment of a witch in our midst.<eos> The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did, I was just wondering, have you redone the assignment that Rachel gave you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I had a ton on my plate.<eos> I was gonna get to it tomorrow.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Please, I-I really was going to do it. I...<eos> I believe you.<eos> But my rule is three strikes and you're out. Otherwise, where does it end?<eos> In that case, why not do this publicly?
And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.<eos> Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.<eos> God bless Mama.<eos> Amen.<eos> And your little sister?<eos> Oh, yes, and God bless Phoebe.<eos> Amen. She's gonna be back home before you know it.<eos> I don't want Mama to come back.<eos> Oh, you don't mean that.<eos> You do too.
We were good together.<eos> I know.<eos> Really, really good.<eos> I know. It was a tough day.<eos> You know what?<eos> What? You were right.<eos> You were right to push him. You've been great with him lately.<eos> He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him.<eos> You know, I knew about Julia.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
I can't talk about it.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll see you around then,<eos> - I guess, huh?<eos> - Mason, I can... there's a way out back I know...<eos> - Yeah, I'd like that. - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. I remember now.<eos> You're not with that guy today?<eos> Excuse me, but if you want to talk, could you please sit down?<eos> Then, I will.<eos> Why do you write novels, Mr. Hanaki?<eos> Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Bert.<eos> Ah, you like the view.<eos> So do I.<eos> Don't believe me?<eos> Check out my shorts.<eos> Got a boner the size of the Palace of the Parliament!<eos> The Palace of the Parliament!<eos> Ha-ha! So, Orzan tells me you have something for me.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - We do...
Come on!<eos> God.<eos> Oh, get out of my way.<eos> Come on!<eos> What's up?<eos> Detective Ionescu.<eos> It's happening today, 3:00 p.m.<eos> West Side Apartments.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
He better?<eos> He's fine.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh. Don't have to thank me.<eos> I got loaned to you.<eos> No, I do. I do.
Well, he's askin' if I'd kill a man for some corn.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, Lieutenant, you steal our corn, we got nothin' to feed the hogs.<eos> If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse.<eos> We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I didn't have no choice.<eos> What kind of life do you think is gonna be better for him?<eos> Yeah, that ain't the point.<eos> I don't want my boy to get lynched.<eos> Or beat.<eos> I want him to go to a school.<eos> I don't want him to drop his eyes every time a white man walk by.<eos> I don't want him to be a "boy" no more once he turn into a man.<eos> Don't you want that, too?<eos> Of course I do.
"Proper union"?<eos> Proper...<eos> I was married in this courthouse.<eos> I was married in this courthouse!<eos> But where we gonna go?<eos> We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up North, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up North.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, Your Honor.
You're almost there.<eos> Open the door. - What are you doing?<eos> - Open the fucking door.<eos> You're already down a finger, Seth.<eos> How much more are you ready to lose?<eos> Get back.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I believe you.<eos> You do?
- Is this... - I don't...<eos> Is this one of those fetish things?<eos> Where you're, like, a foot fetish. Am I the foot?<eos> Do you want to be the foot?<eos> I'm not into feet, but I would like to go out with you.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Yes. - Why?<eos> Really?<eos> I... Do you not want me to?<eos> I do!
And I think I love you, too.<eos> I mean, I do love you, I don't know why I just said that.<eos> I really love you.<eos> I really, really love you.<eos> I mean, I don't...<eos> I can totally handle all of this by myself.<eos> I'm an independent woman.<eos> My God, seriously?<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
- Yes.<eos> I thought that you were...<eos> I just...<eos> On the...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Hey, I'm glad you called.<eos> I'm sorry about lunch today.<eos> I'm an idiot, babe.<eos> I don't even know what's going on with me right now.<eos> - I really don't.
It's so beautiful.<eos> The prophecy was true.<eos> He is the Chosen One.<eos> Hansel.<eos> He's still so hot right now.<eos> No way!<eos> It's a glitter bomb!<eos> Looks like you still have it.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> Well, we do.
Am I gonna train kids at the gym?<eos> You know, bartend at night?<eos> Talk about howl used to be a fighter, used to be world champ?<eos> No, this is what I do.<eos> And I don't know how not to do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I know you think I've been doing a bang-up job all these years, but that ain't exactly true.<eos> I let you put yourself in harm's way.<eos> I... I pushed you to it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Holy shit!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> What did I say?<eos> You can't bet with no money.<eos> You can if you win.<eos> - Did you? - No!<eos> But I got this.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I did.
What, to her?<eos> She doesn't want it.<eos> Hand over the child.<eos> She's so little.<eos> Now she's not fucked up by you yet.<eos> You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again. Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?
She doesn't want it.<eos> Hand over the child.<eos> She's so little.<eos> Now she's not fucked up by you yet.<eos> You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again. Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?

I'm not unpicking the entire bloody structure either.<eos> Will somebody give them a hand over there, please?<eos> All the way up.<eos> Of course, the irony is, they've given this to a bloody documentaries director.<eos> He won't want any dialogue, anyway. It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football, you wait.<eos> What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?<eos> He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.<eos> Self-sacrifice, that's noble.<eos> - Only if he stands a chance.<eos> - Maybe he does.
So, my friend!<eos> Well, now reverse.<eos> Regrésalo.<eos> Ramon, what are you doing?<eos> You need to sing!<eos> - I told you, do not sing.<eos> - You need to sing!<eos> - I am sorry. I can not.<eos> - Yes you can, but do not want.<eos> - Well, I do not.
What the hell is a Zenotek?<eos> -What?<eos> -What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She did it. She did it!<eos> Shut the fuck door!<eos> I gotta tell you, I was always like,<eos> "Tracey, this doesn't make any sense,"<eos> and she was like, "Words, words, words and some numbers."<eos> But she did it.
They on me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But soon.<eos> And he knows it all.<eos> I ain't asking you.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> Do something about Gabe.<eos> Mike... You see what you made me do, man? You see what you've made me do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mike, Mike, Mike. Please, don't.
Yeah?<eos> / Remember something...<eos> Every family has its issues.<eos> But you only have one family.<eos> Like it, Lou. Like it.<eos> Take care.<eos> You too.<eos> Ryan, look who's here!<eos> / Hey, Dad.<eos> Rhino, how you doing, buddy?
I wasn't wrong.<eos> Yes and no.<eos> But yes, the sport makes for fantastic television.<eos> And now you're back.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I like you, Ray.<eos> I feel really bad for what they did to you.<eos> I don't need to look a gift horse up the ass to know there's shit in there.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> We do.
Would anyone else care to share?<eos> Anyone?<eos> The stage is yours.<eos> - Hi, I'm Diane and I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Maybe next time, you'll feel comfortable speaking.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> Fine. Maybe you can just talk to me if that's easier.<eos> Do you ever feel like you hit rock bottom?<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> I sure did. In my late 20's.
- I don't fucking...<eos> And they certainly don't believe in you.<eos> - Yeah, but, Kay, I found gold.<eos> - Goddamn...<eos> Now we're winning, babe.<eos> Would you just let me have the win?<eos> We're winning!<eos> It ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?<eos> I hope you do. Huh?<eos> I do.
All right we're okay, I closed the annular, we got 30 seconds.<eos> Get off the floor, now!<eos> - Duck, are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm all right.<eos> Get a finger on the EDS, get ready to cut that pipe.<eos> Go do it!<eos> Go do it!<eos> - Adam!<eos> - Shane!<eos> What do we do?
The light's on.<eos> That's usually a hint I'm not.<eos> Why do you provoke him, Steph?<eos> Why do I get blamed for everything in this family?<eos> Honey, you know that's not true.<eos> It is.<eos> You and Mom, we never talk about anything.<eos> We never talk about him.<eos> We never talk about how he affects all of us.<eos> We do. We do.
What if I did this to you?<eos> What if...<eos> What if... What if I liked your dad?<eos> What if I gave your dad a hand job?<eos> Oh, Louis, wow, you look so hot with that belt-phone of yours.<eos> Wow.<eos> Oh, krista, you're home early.<eos> Why... mmm. Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him? I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What if...<eos> What if... What if I liked your dad?<eos> What if I gave your dad a hand job?<eos> Oh, Louis, wow, you look so hot with that belt-phone of yours.<eos> Wow.<eos> Oh, krista, you're home early.<eos> Why... mmm. Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him? I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
- You think I like this?<eos> Where were you?<eos> You can't pick up your phone even once?<eos> You don't need to pretend you give a shit about me just because people are watching.<eos> - Oh, give me a break.<eos> - Oh, face it.<eos> You can't wait to take me home so you can be mom's little hero. You live for that shit.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> I just want you to know you're right, Nadine.<eos> Darian, we don't...
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.<eos> Unless essential.<eos> I don't discuss unpleasant matters.<eos> An Ymbryne's is a duty to protect children, Jake.<eos> I am not a child.<eos> He wanted you to tell me everything.<eos> How frustrating for you.<eos> Between Ms. Peregrine rules and my ******* not to scare you off.<eos> It's like no ones telling you anything? !<eos> So why don't you then?
Many years ago, a splinter faction emerged among our people.<eos> Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.<eos> That's Mr. Barron.<eos> He believed that by harnessing the essence of an Ymbryne's powers, he and his cronies.<eos> Could gain immortality and be able to live outside loops.<eos> He devised an experiment.<eos> He kidnapped an Ymbryne not knowing or caring whether she would survive the experiment.<eos> But the fate of Barron and his group was more horrifying still.<eos> Why didn't Barron turn into one?<eos> He did.
You must have a boyfriend.<eos> All she really wants to know is, who are you fucking?<eos> Sorry?<eos> What?<eos> Isn't that what everyone wants to know?<eos> A pretty new girl walks into a room, everyone's head turns, looks her up and down, wondering,<eos> "who is she fucking?<eos> "Who could she fuck?<eos> "And how high can she climb, and is it higher than me?"<eos> I don't...
Well, I thought I'd get more work if I went down a cup size.<eos> So I look like a hanger.<eos> You know? But then my surgeon, Dr. Andrew, he pointed out a lot of other problems with my body.<eos> So I had them shave my jaw, I had a slight eyebrow lift, new nose, cheeks, inner and outer lipo, oh, and they pinned my ears.<eos> Why?<eos> So I could wear a ponytail.<eos> Didn't it hurt?<eos> Anything worth having hurts a little.<eos> Besides, nobody likes the way they look.<eos> I do.
There's Chinese writing on every fucking crate.<eos> Trust me, it's Chinese.<eos> Henry, what the fuck!<eos> We've been trying to reach you for two days!<eos> It's Efraim and David.<eos> We have a serious fucking problem.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.<eos> What, you think the Afghans who are getting shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?<eos> No, but the Pentagon does.
Hey, this is David.<eos> Bro, you want to hear something totally fucked up?<eos> Merry Christmas, Efraim.<eos> It's Christmas?<eos> That's why nobody's here.<eos> I was about to fire the entire office.<eos> Anyway, when I was over there, I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.<eos> Did you know his uncle works at the Albanian defense ministry?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Well, he does.
The power of the waves on that bar... they can pick you up... they can turn you end for end over and over again.<eos> There's no way to survive that.<eos> That's pitchpoling.<eos> Hey, Fitz, are we good?<eos> All right, give it a shot!<eos> Free the lines!<eos> Lines freed!<eos> Did Bernie go out, Gus?<eos> Miriam, what are you doing here?<eos> Did he?
We're using every pump we've got.<eos> We jammed the breakers so the pumps wouldn't trip them.<eos> We've got about two feet till the water... hits those air inlets to the engines... and then the ship's dead.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You hear that?<eos> That's the tide rising, gonna work us off this shoal.<eos> Look, look, this'll at least give us some time.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?<eos> That right.<eos> Sure does, boy.
Hey, you're gonna get busted.<eos> I checked Sanchez and West.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, thanks for helping me out the other night with Standish.<eos> Wouldn't want you to jeopardize your promotion.<eos> All right, look, the whole reason that this ship is on a course is 'cause they charted a plan and they followed it.<eos> So it's lucky Clara didn't get a chance to say yes because I'm incapable of making a plan, incapable of supporting her.<eos> I'm just saying maybe things turned out for the best.<eos> My plan is to find the son of a bitch that stole my ring and marry her the second I get off this ship, and I don't care what her parents or you or anybody else has got to say...<eos> You the kid that does the diving?
You know what you are.<eos> A thief, a liar, and a killer.<eos> You can never undo things you've done.<eos> and you will never be anything.<eos> Good to see you again, amigo.<eos> Tao Tei movement!<eos> All troops to the Wall!<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - No. - How do you know he won't betray us?<eos> - I don't.
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.<eos> They will use it to destroy us.<eos> I'm gonna find it.<eos> And watch them destroy you and your Creed.<eos> You can not kill the Creed.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
I learned how to judge people quicker, and I got you very wrong.<eos> My daddy used to beat me and my brother just because the sun rose, and then whip us just because it set.<eos> I could take that... but when he would do it to our momma...<eos> Get away from me, woman!<eos> That's enough.<eos> No more. Do you hear me?<eos> Pull the damn trigger.<eos> Stop it!<eos> But you didn't kill him?<eos> In my heart, I did.
It's probably how you lost your family in the first place!<eos> All right, look, let's just take it down a notch.<eos> Just give me the tag and--<eos> You know something, for a guy with three hearts you're not very nice.<eos> Three hearts? What are you talking about?<eos> I don't have three hearts.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't!<eos> - You do! - Don't!<eos> - Do!
Okay, fuck this.<eos> - Dont go.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Stay away of me, Stay away, you need help.<eos> Ray...<eos> Ray!<eos> I do not know if you are you, if you are her.<eos> I am, of course I am.<eos> - No, you are not.<eos> Yes you did.
Maybe you should climb under his covers tonight.<eos> What?<eos> He looks at me like I'm trash.<eos> We're not people. We're just the goulds from Dorchester.<eos> We tat the lace for your fucking curtains.<eos> You know what-- don't fucking touch me.<eos> My whole life, i got the high hat and the icy mitt... From people like your father.<eos> We're not less than you.<eos> I never said you were.<eos> Oh, well, he did.
It's the only one you're gonna get. The city's under threat.<eos> We need to find that bomber girl. You'll identify her.<eos> Until we do that, that shit is on you.<eos> I'm just a thief who stole a bag.<eos> Just charge me and we'll straighten this out.<eos> Not gonna happen. Want another red dot on your chest?<eos> - I'm not a terrorist. - Hey! You stole a bag.<eos> - We got a job to do.<eos> - This is crazy. - I don't work for the CIA.<eos> - Well, you do today.
- You're welcome.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I finally found out what that means.<eos> Logan: Let's see what Blake is up to.<eos> - Aah! - Oh, my god.<eos> - Oh! What the fuck?<eos> - Look at that ass!<eos> This is supposed to be private!<eos> I don't do this to you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Nothing.<eos> It won't have existed for long enough.<eos> But history will remember me, and what I built.<eos> Mr. Denali, recruit an army to go back with us.<eos> Pretty.<eos> I mean good.<eos> Your shooting is good.<eos> Do it again. Sight the lowest part of the V, cheek resting against the...<eos> I had a father, thank you.<eos> I didn't.
How many refugees?<eos> Only a handful, a small handful.<eos> - They told me forty five.<eos> Yes, forty five, that is the right number, that's right.<eos> I did not want to bore you with precise numbers.<eos> I did not count women and old men.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why so lenient?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> Actually, I do.
- We must leave... - No, no.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you today, Kelly? - You know what?<eos> I feel a little sensitive. Maybe I have a bad day.<eos> Do you allow your schedules?<eos> You know?<eos> What I care take that bus to the south as soon as possible.<eos> - And if I do not?<eos> - You are fired.<eos> Well, fire me, idiot.<eos> Do it!
And I know who you are, Billy Lynn from Stovall.<eos> My great-grandmother was Miss Stovall, 1937.<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> Everyone said she had a shot at winning Miss Texas that year.<eos> Really? And how'd she do?<eos> Second runner-up.<eos> Everybody said she should've won, but the fix was in.<eos> You know how those pageant deals work.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But if you did.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - I'm just saying.<eos> - Shut!<eos> Do you wish we had a choice, is that what you're asking?<eos> Well...<eos> We don't, Sergeant.
But two weeks? That's like two years in Hollywood time.<eos> It breaks my heart to say, man, but people move on.<eos> "People move on."<eos> People move on.<eos> Everybody supports the troops.<eos> Hell, yeah, "We're so fucking proud of our troops," but when it comes to actual money, then all of a sudden we're stuck in everybody's tight-ass budget.<eos> Talk is cheap, I get that. Talk is cheap. But money screams.<eos> This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.<eos> I think we should all fear for it.<eos> I do, Dave. I truly do.
Pull it up!<eos> We got a satellite feed here of who he's talking to, if you want to look.<eos> Wait, go back.<eos> Stop.<eos> He's saying that each of the 12 is offering advanced technology.<eos> Go back again. And play.<eos> "Our science team is attempting to decode the sets."<eos> "Sets." I don't know what that means.<eos> Something about advantage, suits, honor and, uh, flowers.<eos> I don't...
I must be out of my goddamn mind to ask you for help.<eos> You wanna get us killed?<eos> !<eos> Huh?<eos> !<eos> That's not a Midlands Branch.<eos> That's not part of the plan.<eos> Now, we got to go back to the ranch and bury the car.<eos> Fuck!<eos> No, we do not.
And I wonder why my kids won't do this shit for a living.<eos> Move 'em out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go, go! go-<eos> You wanna call it in?<eos> Oh, it's gonna burn out when it hits the Brazos.<eos> No one to call around here, anyway.<eos> No, these boys is on their own.<eos> I still don't see the problem, Toby.<eos> You still don't...
Oh, that looks like a man who could foreclose on a house.<eos> Excuse me, Natalie.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Banker.<eos> Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer stay with you till your father arrives.<eos> All right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Didn't happen to have your surveillance cameras on this morning, did you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, so you have the robbery on video.<eos> Of course we do.
There's nothing new around here... except them pumpjacks.<eos> Each one of them making you a month what you and your brother stole from all 4 banks combined.<eos> Help me understand, then.<eos> Help me understand why 4 people died... so you could steal money that it don't seem you've spent, that it don't seem you need.<eos> You got a family?<eos> My partner had a family.<eos> A big one.<eos> They don't got no pumpjacks in their backyard.<eos> I didn't kill your friend.<eos> Yes, you did.
What must I do to truly be saved?<eos> Ellen, my darling, what is it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What if I have been led astray, Mother?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I am so afraid.<eos> Mother, the preacher said such bad things about Father Miller.<eos> Don't you listen to any of that.<eos> But I heard.<eos> We all did!
Our son to the sea.<eos> Now all of our money is gone?<eos> How much more of this do you think we can take?<eos> We must pray. The Lord will provide.<eos> Joseph, please... ..have you nothing more to offer?<eos> Perhaps the earth should swallow me whole.<eos> Is that what I should pray for?<eos> Do you have any mail for me, Mr Drew?<eos> Oh, yes, Mr Bates.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
There's no leadership, no churches.<eos> I hear there's a young woman having visions in Maine, and a sea captain holding prayer meetings on Saturdays.<eos> Saturdays?<eos> Well, that's one mob I won't be joining.<eos> (ALL LAUGH)<eos> (BABY GRIZZLES)<eos> Bates has printed about the Sabbath again.<eos> But how did he have the money?<eos> JAMES:<eos> I... He didn't.
A predictable attack has a predictable...<eos> You asked to be taught.<eos> And clearly, there is much you need to learn.<eos> How long, teacher?<eos> Until the shadow moves from here to there.<eos> Twice.<eos> You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase. How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
He just got lost.<eos> You saved this entire base, Kirk.<eos> Millions of souls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It wasn't just me.<eos> Never is.<eos> We have considered the postion of Vice Admiral It's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice admiral do not fly, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<eos> - That's right, I know you.<eos> I know you got some Uncle Remus in your blood.<eos> You got more stories than the devil got sinners.<eos> Hell, I done seen him, too.<eos> Done talked to the devil.<eos> Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?<eos> How you doing, Rose?
- He ain't seen no devil.<eos> I told him that man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.<eos> Anything he can't understand, he want to call it the devil.<eos> Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's to get some furniture.<eos> You got three rooms for $298.<eos> That what it say on the radio.<eos> "Three rooms, $298." He made up a little song about it.<eos> I get down there, man tell me I can't get no credit.<eos> I'm working every day, can't get no credit.<eos> What to do?
We got us a band.<eos> We gonna try to stay together when we get out, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm still playing.<eos> Still helps me get out of bed in the morning.<eos> As long as it do that, I'm gonna stick with it, try to make some sense out of it.<eos> Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.<eos> Let me get in here and get these eggs, man.<eos> Get ready to go bury Papa.<eos> How you doing?
He's going to be okay.<eos> There are very few people out there who can claim to have out-Bonded James Bond.<eos> But birthday boy "Wild Willy" Will Traynor is certainly one of them.<eos> So, Will, any final thoughts, bro?<eos> I'm thinking you should be next, mate.<eos> Yeah, right!<eos> We're all thinking it.<eos> Is there really nothing he can't do?<eos> - Do we hate him?<eos> Yes. - We do!
He works for me, he's not family.<eos> Okay, well, I think he's nice.<eos> Yeah, and he's a lot older than you.<eos> - He's 28, he told me.<eos> - And you're 17.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> I got the mammogram today, you know I hate them.<eos> I do.
Thanks, man.<eos> But we'll hang. We'll do it.<eos> Yeah, we'll totally hang.<eos> No big deal, buddy.<eos> All right, have a good one.<eos> You buzz me up, and I'll give you a free dance on the way down.<eos> How about that?<eos> I'll let you up.<eos> I like Gordon Lightfoot.<eos> Who doesn't?
I just know that I'm old enough to know that we are too young, To make the right decision.<eos> And what is the wrong decision, - Which I will support? - OK that...<eos> Is complex.<eos> I'm telling you, when we are with you.<eos> I do not know if she is still alive.<eos> My parents may see the corpse.<eos> You will not see her body.<eos> That's part of the plan.<eos> Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.<eos> - I do.
How can I help you?<eos> Your robot has just spanked me and then beaten in the bushes.<eos> Oh. Yes, no, very funny.<eos> The stupid idiot asks me if I'd touched the sex doll immoral.<eos> Did you?<eos> Why must proclaim with us the message Limus never?<eos> Him the Lord else has imposed treasure.<eos> If, otherwise we'll be late.<eos> - And I know how you hate that, honey.<eos> - I do.
You said you'd leave them alone!<eos> And I meant it at the time!<eos> I detest bloodshed as much as any Blarg, but sometimes, sacrifices are necessary for the greater good.<eos> I know you're working with Nefarious on this.<eos> Yes, isn't it wonderful?<eos> We're all part of the same dream team.<eos> We should make T-shirts!<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> You have no idea the kinds of evil he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but I do.
You'll probably need this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now let's cut through the trees, it's quicker, yeah?<eos> Dad? Dad, what are you doing?<eos> Your factor, it's not here.<eos> I can't find your factor.<eos> - Dad, I told you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I told you I left it at the hotel.<eos> - No, you didn't.
All this time.<eos> I've been living my life the way my father saw it.<eos> Mending wrongs for a ghost.<eos> Thinking I'm here to do good.<eos> Superman was never real.<eos> It's just a dream of a farmer from Kansas.<eos> That farmer's dream is all some people have.<eos> It's all that gives them hope.<eos> This means something.<eos> It did on my world.
I can't take my son camping.<eos> We don't go camping here.<eos> We don't live in Maine.<eos> - How many kids do you have?<eos> - One.<eos> A daughter.<eos> Kit.<eos> She's 21.<eos> - Does she tell you anything?<eos> - She does.
I thought so.<eos> Why?<eos> My son's birthday is two days from now.<eos> I used to send him a card every year... but I never heard anything back.<eos> National Guard did all they could to protect us.<eos> And where we're headin', this hotel... they made their last stand there.<eos> Didn't realize they were just packing' meat... in one place like a goddamn buffet.<eos> They lasted two days.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to get down there myself.<eos> Hell, we all did.
Your whole life's plan, not mine.<eos> I thought maybe it was but it ain't.<eos> I always make that mistake.<eos> Plus I think I'm pregnant.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> I don't know-know.<eos> I just haven't had my lady time in a while.<eos> It's been on my mind.<eos> I'm sorry if this interferes with your destiny.<eos> It don't really.
Who is God?<eos> God is the Creator of Heaven and Earth and of all things.<eos> What is Man?<eos> Man is a creature composed of body and soul, made in the image of God.<eos> Why did God make you, Maria?<eos> God made me to know Him, to love Him and to serve Him in this world.<eos> And does God want you to serve Him with half of your wits?<eos> With one hand in the air?<eos> No, Father.<eos> No, He does not.
NOW!<eos> Grotto sector clear.<eos> ls the garden completely walled?<eos> On all sides.<eos> The only exits are through the Palazzo Pitti on the north side and through the visitors' gates on the east and the west sides.<eos> No other way out?<eos> I suppose if you count the Vasari Gate.<eos> But it's ancient.<eos> No one knows about it.<eos> Langdon does.
All right.<eos> We're right above the Hall of Five Hundred.<eos> There's a stairway leading down to the street on the other side.<eos> So one step at a time, huh?<eos> Okay.<eos> You afraid of heights?<eos> A little.<eos> I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.<eos> So don't look down.<eos> Or do.
He created a bioaerosol.<eos> So it will spread in the air.<eos> - Empty the place.<eos> - No!<eos> Contain it.<eos> Jam all communications down there. No messages get in or out.<eos> Got it.<eos> Shall we go in?<eos> Robert, you don't have to go in there with us.<eos> Yes, I do.
I understand completely.<eos> She's become an agreeable companion.<eos> Even her tendency to extreme quiet I've grown to find rather soothing.<eos> But there is one factor that concerns me.<eos> - Does she look quite well?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That was your impression?<eos> London's vaporous air is not, I think, healthy for her.<eos> - Does she not seem pale?<eos> - She does.
Lots of ins and outs.<eos> We'd just like to know how many men you see a week, Mona.<eos> What?<eos> We just want to know how many you're paying for.<eos> - Just one or...<eos> - Very relevant.<eos> - Or an invasion of men?<eos> - I'm not stingy with my body.<eos> - As you very well know, Ole.<eos> - You do, Ole?
- I'm against locked doors on principle.<eos> Me too.<eos> - Have you got like a plan?<eos> - Yes, we all have regular cooking days.<eos> - When you've gotta go, you've gotta go.<eos> - They're being silly.<eos> We rarely eat this good.<eos> - Who knows about locks?<eos> - Locks?<eos> - Maybe Steffen does.
Do you mind?<eos> I'm training him.<eos> - Are you Durand?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> This is Eric's brother.<eos> Here.<eos> This is Eric's fee for his fight.<eos> He wanted you to have this.<eos> If anything happened to him.<eos> And of course... it did.
Can we, Magicolio?<eos> Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I love magic.<eos> Like you, and many others who, I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school,<eos> I dabbled with it.<eos> But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
No Alex!<eos> Wretches!<eos> Alex!<eos> As soon as I left, I went to get you.<eos> I knew the passport you had, so it was not difficult to track you down,<eos> But it took me a while to get you out.<eos> I wish I had sent you a note. I wish I could have told you I was coming, But could not take the risk, in case they were watching,<eos> Why did you not tell me?<eos> I tried.<eos> No, you did not.
You all right?<eos> Where's Naz?<eos> What?<eos> So, who's "he" in the sentence "he kill her or something"?<eos> Uh, look, man, I was just saying.<eos> You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
Turn to the other side.<eos> Take your shirt off.<eos> Make sure you get some close-ups on those back scratches. Get a shot of that.<eos> Put your arms up.<eos> All right, put your hand here.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> Let's get a close-up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'd like to get a little swab of the blood on your hands. A little swipe under the nails. A little bit off the scratches on your back.<eos> Okay if I do that?
Testudo!<eos> Hold this line!<eos> Forward!<eos> Forward!<eos> Tribune, we have Barabbas!<eos> Bring him.<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God chooses us over you.<eos> Not today, he didn't.
- Which engine did you lose? - Both.<eos> Both engines.<eos> "If fuel remaining, engine mode, select your ignition."<eos> - Ignition.<eos> - Ignition.<eos> - Thrust levers, confirm idle.<eos> - Idle.<eos> Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.<eos> - We don't have that.<eos> - No, we don't.
- Could be worse.<eos> We could be walking.<eos> Atta boy.<eos> Don't stop for anyone.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We fucking made it.<eos> - We did.<eos> We did.
You know what, Tyson?<eos> - It was still flat.<eos> - Flat, flat.<eos> What about the moon, then?<eos> How do you explain that?<eos> I never did care for anything any gorgie did say, nor His Majesty the Queen, nor the army.<eos> What my dad said were the truth and I'd fight any fucker who says else.<eos> Your bloody dad telling the same... bloody story every bloody night.<eos> I mean, does he actually believe we buy all that bollocks?<eos> Tyson actually does.
We was talking about his dog.<eos> Don't ignore me, Tyson Cutler.<eos> Get your skinny little arse out.<eos> I tell you, that school's been rokkering him some right wrongs.<eos> Say what you like.<eos> He's still going.<eos> All right, then. Listen to your ma.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - I know.<eos> No one does.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What's that, another son?<eos> - Don't be daft. That's our grandson, Gangnam Style.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi, Dad. - Hey, Dad.<eos> And this here is Luke.<eos> We call him that because he's got leukemia.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He doesn't really.
Stopped on our way through.<eos> - School is where? - Iowa.<eos> Hawkeyes?<eos> - You and Connor ever take any drugs?<eos> Conner never... and I'm pregnant.<eos> I mean, I think I am.<eos> That's why Conner... he went into the store.<eos> It's okay. Have some water.<eos> How did Conner know the store clerk?<eos> He didn't.
I can't...<eos> - What? Who are you talking to?<eos> - Me.<eos> I just heard you in my head.<eos> - I'm telepathic, I read minds.<eos> - Well, stay out of mine.<eos> I don't need some weird girl creeping around in there.<eos> Don't worry, Scott, there's not much to see.<eos> Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name.<eos> No, you didn't.
Kurt, no!<eos> The magnetic field is too strong, I can't get us in there.<eos> Erik!<eos> Mystique.<eos> I know you think you've lost everything. But, you haven't.<eos> You have me.<eos> You have Charles.<eos> You have more family than you know.<eos> You never had the chance to save your family before.<eos> But you do now.
It's human nature, Charles.<eos> I still have hope.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> "Hope."<eos> I was right about Raven.<eos> I was even right about you.<eos> What about the rest of the world?<eos> Doesn't it ever wake you up in the middle of the night?<eos> The feeling that one day they'll come for you... and your children.<eos> It does, indeed
It's our way to avoid conflict.<eos> We stay apart, but we stay at peace.<eos> 'Let me show you the blood lilies.'<eos> - Something to discuss?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> Come. We shall leave the men to it.<eos> My wife is capable of hearing what the commissioner has to say, Mrs Lancaster.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Though what I have to say she may not want to hear.<eos> Oh, but I do.
The UN have a petition signed by every prominent black leader in the US.<eos> America is sending funds to Mr Khama, so that he can defend himself against us.<eos> It's... I mean, look at these.<eos> Never has a Labour government been criticised this way by the negro press.<eos> We are on the eve of the election.<eos> I am pleading with you.<eos> Send him home before Churchill does.<eos> It will be an almighty humiliation if a Tory government fulfils our responsibility!<eos> I would like nothing more than to say to hell with Malan and his damned apartheid, but we need South Africa to protect us from Stalin and his advance there.<eos> We all do!
Hello!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - You recorded that?<eos> - You gave me permission, the other day.<eos> - That's why you questioned me so much last night. - Yeah, I'm doing a story.<eos> That's why you stayed at the campsite, for your story.<eos> In part.<eos> Also because I was concerned about you... and your sister, and I liked you.<eos> - Do you even have a brother?<eos> - Of course I do.
How can a prince be a murderer and beloved by his people?<eos> How can an apothecary be evil tempted but right thinking?<eos> How can invisible men make themselves lonelier by being seen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your stories never made sense to me.<eos> Because humans are complicated beasts.<eos> You believe comforting lies, while knowing full well... the painful truth that makes those lies necessary.<eos> In the end, Conor, it is not important what you think.<eos> It is only important what you do.<eos> So what do I do?
We're all about to die.<eos> Well, that's no good.<eos> Stress is a killer.<eos> Let us loosen our limbs and open our minds.<eos> Downward Dog!<eos> Uh... Seriously?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I have all the time in the world.<eos> Actually, you don't have all the time in the world.<eos> None of us do.
But they messed with my dad's job, they leaked photos of my sister online, they stole our identities, Vee.<eos> Me and Ty, we became prisoners of the game.<eos> Oh, come on, what does that even mean?<eos> It's the third category.<eos> Watcher, Player, Prisoner.<eos> I'm trapped.<eos> The only way out is to win.<eos> - So, you have to win.<eos> - No...<eos> No, you do.
I know.<eos> Okay, so we're playing here and Raphina walks by.<eos> - So where do I jump from?<eos> - Here.<eos> How'd that look, lads?<eos> Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
What possible interest could I be to the Americans?<eos> Because your Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and the Encouragement of Virtue sounds a lot like the Taliban's old Ministry of Vice and Virtue.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Kim Baker.<eos> When the Taliban was in power, they enforced their version of sharia.<eos> One of their edicts was a rule that all men must shave the hair of their pubis.<eos> They would walk the streets carrying a small wooden rod, a dowel, which they would roll along the front of a man's trousers.<eos> If a man's pubic hair was long enough to curl around the dowel, they would beat him.<eos> Now, I ask you, do I look like a man to walk the streets carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?<eos> No, sir, you do not.
But you have to take care of them for me, okay?<eos> I love you all so much.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> We want to see mom.<eos> Plus, grandpa can't oppress us.<eos> - We want to honor her life.<eos> - It's the least you could do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
All right.<eos> I'm beat.<eos> But if I come out, are you gonna talk or are you gonna shoot?<eos> I'm prepared for both.<eos> Well, that doesn't make me feel comfortable.<eos> Well, you got a gun, Marshal?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Better leave it behind.<eos> Well, if I come out unarmed, how do I know you won't shoot?<eos> Well, you don't.
Warm it up in your hands.<eos> We're just gonna put it around.<eos> Like this.<eos> Doesn't have to be pretty.<eos> Cover the whole thing.<eos> Fingers too.<eos> See?<eos> Fun.<eos> - Do you remember when you and your friends had that party and you painted all those crazy animals on my wall?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
What happened to the barbershop, Calvin?<eos> I used to come here to get away from women.<eos> Especially the ones I'll never ever wanna see again as long as I live.<eos> You know you love the ladies, especially the sistas.<eos> Yeah, it's true, I like the sisters. I do.<eos> Just not that one.<eos> But homegirl in a catsuit, though, she could get it.<eos> What's good, ma?<eos> Not you, pa.<eos> What them pockets do, little daddy?
Dad, come on, I need it.<eos> Angie, you got 20 bucks?<eos> Yeah, I got 20.<eos> Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What up, son?<eos> Does everybody in here that's working...<eos> What up, Dad?<eos> -got at least $20 in their pocket or purse?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Craig came by here 20 minutes ago looking for you.<eos> Okay, thanks, Cal.<eos> I'll text him.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> I need you to pick up Maya from school today, too.<eos> I just squeezed in another last-minute appointment and I can't do it.<eos> Yeah, I see.<eos> Come on, babe, please.<eos> I got an appointment, too.<eos> -Can't Kenny do it?
Know what I'm sayin'?<eos> -How are you?<eos> -How you doin'?<eos> He's not just the president of black America.<eos> He's the President of the United States of America.<eos> And personally, I think he's doin' a great job.<eos> You know what? The two of them just make me believe in the sanctity of marriage.<eos> I hate to be the one to say this...<eos> But Barack has definitely got bitches.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You're just an idiot.<eos> I'm just a man, baby.<eos> I get it.<eos> And I know I've been working a lot.<eos> But I need you to know... That I see everything you do.<eos> You're an amazing man, Rashad.<eos> You're an amazing father to Maya.<eos> I could never ask for a better partner than you.<eos> I guess I just figured you knew how I felt.<eos> I do.
This is Scott.<eos> Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> You're heavy. You're a fatty. You're a little fatty.<eos> Rachel?<eos> No.<eos> Anna, get in the house.<eos> Your wife hit me on Friday night!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Yes. Yes, she did.
You fucking murderer! You killed her!<eos> You fucking killed her, I know it!<eos> You're un-fucking-believable.<eos> Now listen. Listen to me.<eos> Megan got into his car that night.<eos> You think I don't remember. You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car?<eos> Did Megan get in your car?<eos> -No! -Yes, she did.
They won't complicate a heist with murder.<eos> In half an hour they'll come out.<eos> They know they have no choice.<eos> One important thing:<eos> I want the bank robbers isolated when they come out.<eos> I just wanted to know why they set up this whole mess and why they let us out.<eos> I wanted to check the information.<eos> How was I to know that that bastard was going to fuck us.<eos> I know I fucked up.<eos> But I did good too.
She was my daughter and I failed her.<eos> No, I knew this would happen.<eos> The witch told me years ago.<eos> She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.<eos> "And gold their shrouds."<eos> Everything she said came true.<eos> You couldn't have stopped it.<eos> It's prophecy. It's fate.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Of course I do.
Charlie.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay, all right?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey! I said who the fuck are you?<eos> When they find you, you're looking at three counts of murder one!<eos> That's death in this state!<eos> Something tells me I got a better lawyer than you.<eos> Why did you kill Emily?<eos> I didn't.
She was high... and she slapped me.<eos> And I was so mad at her... and you.<eos> The guy in the church, he knew.<eos> In the back of your mind, I thought that you knew, too.<eos> I pushed her.<eos> She fell.<eos> Her head hit the table and she didn't get up.<eos> I could have helped her, but I didn't help her because I thought that if she...<eos> If her heart stopped beating, then mine would stop hurting.<eos> It kind of did.
Now it's on your foot!<eos> The other foot!<eos> It's on your bottom!<eos> I gots it.<eos> Seems to know you, gal. Look. It is a golden phizzwizard.<eos> I wish I could hear it.<eos> Here.<eos> It be's very soft.<eos> Do you actually hear what these dreams say?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I look over at Julie, Julie freaking out.<eos> We drive couple miles, tension like a motherfucker.<eos> He says, "Pull over." So we do.<eos> We pull over the side of the road, and he gets out the car, he's in the weeds or something.<eos> I think he's takin' a piss, doin' some kind of shit he doesn't want us to see.<eos> I look in the backseat. There's that bag, just sittin' there, lookin' right back at me.<eos> I look over at the guy.<eos> Guy about 20 feet from the car.<eos> I turn to Julie. "Julie, drive, and fuck it."<eos> And we do.
Okay, good. You can put your coat right now.<eos> And have a seat.<eos> I'd like to draw some blood and do a routine workup. And I'd like to get an MRI.<eos> An MRI?<eos> Everything looks normal, but I just like to be safe.<eos> There's a place down the street that can do one right now.<eos> That's it. You're all done.<eos> What?<eos> What? Why won't you stop?<eos> Do it again!
Why do I drink it, then?<eos> One of those unresolved mysteries of life.<eos> How's my crew?<eos> Or, how are my crew?<eos> Whichever is grammatically correct.<eos> Well, sir, the Webbs, um, are just checked in.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And the other thing?<eos> The other thing.<eos> As you can guess, I imagine, Reynard wants more money.<eos> Of course he does.
How long is he supposed to be staying here?<eos> I don't know, how long are you supposed to be staying here?<eos> That's not fair.<eos> I was in trouble.<eos> Well, so is he, babe.<eos> We're just your ordinary, everyday nuclear family.<eos> Members only.<eos> What the fuck does that say?<eos> It says you're a member.<eos> Damn right it does, baby.
- Ladies...<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Really.<eos> Curse him! Damn him!<eos> Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.<eos> What's that?<eos> Call yourself a Catholic?<eos> You don't know the excommunication rite?<eos> And you do?
We do more than work, you know.<eos> We explore, like, America.<eos> We party.<eos> A whole bunch of shit. It's cool.<eos> Hey, yo, Jake!<eos> - I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man. - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
- She's happy all the time.<eos> - No, she's not.<eos> She's only happy when her dude's around.<eos> - Who's her dude? - I don't have a dude.<eos> Let me know who the fuck her dude is.<eos> You don't know who the fuck her dude is? - Let me know.<eos> Jake?<eos> - I don't have a dude.<eos> Yeah, she doesn't have a fucking dude.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Socrates, let's go.<eos> - Fine!<eos> - No fine!<eos> Can I just ask?<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Your grandparents are living in sin because your pappou won't propose.<eos> Uh, I don't get why Yiayia needs that.<eos> Because you're not a woman who has put up with Pappou for 50 years.<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> No, you don't.
This is the way I thought it would always be.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Life would open its arms and he would carry all before him.<eos> He was the Swede, after all.<eos> Jerry Levov.<eos> God, Nathan!<eos> I didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Well, I didn't expect to see you either...<eos> I was sure you'd find all this sentimentality repellent.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's it?<eos> She made her rewrite it.<eos> So I wrote...<eos> "Why are... kangaroos here?"<eos> - And then last week, the teacher asked them, "What is life?"<eos> This is what they ask in school?<eos> "What is life?" What did you answer?<eos> I don't...<eos> - remember.<eos> - Yes, you do.
We've got enough trouble tonight.<eos> The curfew's to protect people.<eos> From what?<eos> They should riot.<eos> I'm sorry, officer.<eos> We-- we're both sorry.<eos> I am not fucking sorry.<eos> She's 16.<eos> You got any at home, you'll understand.<eos> I don't.
Women in trauma, women who have been ill, it can help them to become a new woman.<eos> But I want the old Dawn.<eos> I want my wife and I want Merry.<eos> We're not talking about Merry.<eos> But as for Dawn, what if you were to go along with her, support her in this, in the trip to Switzerland, the operation?<eos> It could help the both of you to put the past behind you.<eos> I don't want to put the past behind.<eos> The past is Merry.<eos> There's no way I want to put that behind.<eos> But Dawn does.
That's creepy. Yes.<eos> It's really bothering me.<eos> Whatever. It's not a big deal. You shouldn't let it bother you.<eos> It's not a big deal?<eos> No. What, that someone could be watching you right now?<eos> No, I'm not hiding anything.<eos> That's such a bullshit line.<eos> What is? I have nothing to hide.<eos> I don't.<eos> Everyone does.
He can now enjoy all of the sweet, sweet liberty allowed under the regime of President Vladimir Putin.<eos> There is still a thing called execution.<eos> Mr. Snowden actually deserves asylum and protection around the globe.<eos> But he does have asylum in Russia at least.<eos> He can engage in the debate he started.<eos> And the world now has an example that you can do the right thing, and you don't have to end up in a cage, one room, a prison.<eos> After more than a year in the country under temporary asylum,<eos> Edward Snowden has received a three-year residency permit in Russia.<eos> And now, here live from Moscow, Edward Snowden.<eos> Hi, Ed. How you doing?
It's from this morning's paper.<eos> Well, what the...<eos> Matt, it's Lhotsky.<eos> What?<eos> Boles, he must've known about it.<eos> Listen, think why Lhotsky's dead.<eos> Obviously, he was talking to Webb, so they killed him.<eos> They're going to kill me...<eos> We don't know why that guy's dead.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Stop talkin'.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look, man, I already told you, makin' a report.<eos> That guy isn't gonna come back and bother you.<eos> I'll bet you scared him off pretty good, huh?<eos> Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... My friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
You let me know if you need anything.<eos> Admiral Gardner.<eos> Harrison, at ease.<eos> I've been under a lot of pressure to finally put us on the offensive.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't had time to meet with you until now.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> You and your crew have been through a lot the past six months.<eos> I wish I could say that it gets easier.<eos> But it never does.
Harrison, at ease.<eos> I've been under a lot of pressure to finally put us on the offensive.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't had time to meet with you until now.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> You and your crew have been through a lot the past six months.<eos> I wish I could say that it gets easier.<eos> But it never does.<eos> No, sir.<eos> It doesn't.
Everyone else was cracking.<eos> That's why you get 200,000 people surrendering to 60,000.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Now, the thing is, politicians, they don't understand tactics. And soldiers, they don't understand strategy.<eos> But Caesar, he understood both.<eos> Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
8:00 a.m.<eos> You know what time Surrogate's Court opens?<eos> 8:00 a.m.<eos> And when was Andrea's funeral? That Wednesday.<eos> So, two days before you buried her, you applied for her trust fund.<eos> I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?<eos> I don't, because I haven't been back there.<eos> She didn't.
No.<eos> How many times have you had sex, with women or men?<eos> Once before, with a girl.<eos> Only once before?<eos> And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't. Okay.
They sold that dope, they solicited that guy, they stole that iPhone.<eos> It's clear to me just looking at them.<eos> So, I tell them, uh, "Don't be stupid, take the deal."<eos> The first time I saw Naz, he was sitting alone in a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.<eos> He'd just been arrested.<eos> I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped.<eos> I turned around and went back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients.<eos> And I still don't after all this time.
Nobody sells this out.<eos> You sold 15,000 seats. That's still really good.<eos> No, it's not good.<eos> Hammerleg sold this place out last week!<eos> Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.<eos> They're concerned about ticket sales.<eos> What?<eos> But it's an 18,000-seat place.<eos> Nobody sells that out.<eos> Hammerleg did. Last week.
Yeah.<eos> You signed him?<eos> Conner, come on.<eos> Are you kidding me, Harry?<eos> It's just business.<eos> It's not to me!<eos> All right, look, decide right now, him or me.<eos> Come on, don't go there.<eos> Look, I got a family to feed.<eos> What? No, you don't!
What?<eos> Gotta coordinate with cpd.<eos> Cops hates feds, you're the newest.<eos> Least amount of hate.<eos> Don't take any shit from those assholes.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> I felt bad for never giving you anything at west Chester.<eos> Do you think this is political?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Apparently you do.
I'm not gonna take anything, I just need to turn the money in.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I don't know how much my wife knows about the man that I've become.<eos> I've done some really fucked up things, man.<eos> Really bad things.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> That's not how this is gonna go down, mims.<eos> I need to do it for her.<eos> This has nothing to do with her.<eos> Maybe it does.
Have a nice day.<eos> Leave him alone! He didn't mean...<eos> Hey.<eos> I went easy on you before. But now...<eos> You're not gonna pass through the restricted zone on your way home, "bosmain." We can't go around.<eos> Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
Maybe take Amos.<eos> Alone is fine.<eos> We're runnin' out of ammo.<eos> James Holden.<eos> Shit just follow you around, don't it kid?<eos> Are you a cop? Not anymore.<eos> Hey, thanks for the assist. Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here? No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
Does the, um, the secret rule have a name?<eos> Yes, "The Right of Disposal".<eos> "The Right of Disposal".<eos> You're allowed to do it with poison or weed killer, if you have any.<eos> Or you can just drop something heavy on him like a medical encyclopedia or Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.<eos> So... where did you learn about the secret rule?<eos> Let's talk about your dad.<eos> I don't like what you're insinuating!<eos> Yes, it was my idea to bring Lou-Lou here!<eos> Peter did nothing wrong!
I did.<eos> I see we're all ready to go.<eos> Murtagh, please try not to insult too many people tonight.<eos> Are you... mad, woman?<eos> I can see every inch of you, right down to your third rib.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
- Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line, because, if you get a strike, it's gonna slice it right open, and you know what happens then?<eos> - What?<eos> - The sharks will smell the blood, and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> - No, they won't.<eos> - Yeah, they will.<eos> Dad, will they?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You know, I seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, he did.
I've just gotta work it all out, I swear.<eos> How? My taking' me to Wonkatonka, Minnesota,<eos> - with uncle Donny? - Minnetonka.<eos> - Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> - Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> Huh? The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one even knows where she is.<eos> I do.
I can't hear a goddamn word you're saying.<eos> What?<eos> Did Lee get food?<eos> He didn't... what?<eos> Did Lee get food?<eos> No!<eos> He doesn't want any.<eos> - We're good. - I'll make him a plate.<eos> Forget it.<eos> He doesn't...
She just... she just disappears.<eos> She's like the fantasmo,no?<eos> You know, you know fantasmo?<eos> -Fantasma, con "A."<eos> -SГ­, con "A."<eos> The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, con "A," was to find the secret beach. And now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu.<eos> Nursing a hangover.<eos> SГ­.Major hangover.<eos> You don't like it when someone change your plans, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
Little Romeo and little this and that, right?<eos> But I didn't know who Taylor Swift was.<eos> Who the fuck is she?<eos> - I never heard of that bitch ever.<eos> - The fuck do you know, man? You didn't even know we invaded Egypt.<eos> - Iraq.<eos> - Same fuckin' thing.<eos> Goddamn right I didn't.<eos> I didn't even fuckin' know where it was.<eos> Still don't.
We were at her place, we were drinking. I don't drink.<eos> And she started giving me all kinds...<eos> I wanna tell you something, and it's the most important thing you'll ever hear in your entire life, so don't not hear it.<eos> Shut it!<eos> They come up with their story, we come up with ours.<eos> The jury gets to decide which they like best.<eos> Now, the good news is we get to hear what their story is first before we have to tell them ours. So we keep our mouths shut until we know what they're doing.<eos> You keep saying "story," like I'm making it up.<eos> I want to tell you the truth.<eos> You really, really don't.
When I woke up, she was dead.<eos> So I ran away.<eos> Why did you run away? You didn't do anything.<eos> - I was scared.<eos> - Did you know this girl?<eos> No, I only met her.<eos> I... I didn't even know her name.<eos> They said you had a knife on you.<eos> You didn't, right?<eos> I did.
I can show you now if you want.<eos> We can go outside.<eos> Your parents are nice people.<eos> I'm gonna try and expedite, get that cab back to your father as soon as possible.<eos> I know how important that is.<eos> We're both working men.<eos> Your lawyer tell you not to talk to me anymore?<eos> Not even casually?<eos> He ask you how it happened?<eos> He didn't?
What else? For what it's worth, he's Muslim.<eos> Nation of Islam or...<eos> Real one. As in, from Queens. Pakistani.<eos> I wanna wait on the blood.<eos> I want a house in Montauk.<eos> Come on, Helen. You sure he did it?<eos> No question.<eos> You blinked.<eos> I did not blink.<eos> Dennis, honey, you did.
Putting my stuff away.<eos> I don't want anything to wrinkle.<eos> Could you at least stay in my room?<eos> Please don't start.<eos> You know that's not happening.<eos> - I just thought...<eos> - What did you think?<eos> I work for you.<eos> How would it look if I were to stay in your room?<eos> - A lot better than if you didn't.
Why don't you take my money?<eos> It's all yours.<eos> - No.<eos> - And why don't you just finish this?<eos> Just finish it, I'm fucking telling you to fucking finish it today.<eos> I am done giving you what you want.<eos> You can finish this.<eos> I need you to finish this, please.<eos> I need you to finish this right now.<eos> Do it, do it!
Neosporin smells like maple syrup.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> At the pancake house, nothing.<eos> And if I told you it's an allergic reaction to cologne that's hastening the spread?<eos> Then that would be ironic.<eos> Taking your antihistamines?<eos> I can't.<eos> They knock me out halfway into the next day.<eos> Do you want to get better or not?<eos> I do. I just...
If you want roly-poly, Arthur, I'll give you roly-poly.<eos> And my roly-poly will knock her roly-poly into a cocked hat.<eos> 8:00, after parade, roly-poly.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Roly-poly.<eos> Oh, miss winters.<eos> I say, miss winters.<eos> We're so confused, aren't we, cissy?<eos> Our brother, Charles, told us that you're writing an article on the home guard for the lady magazine.<eos> -Yes. -But they just did one.
Oh, you guys don't know?<eos> Steve's with my associate, Dr. Kalgary, about to undergo an irreversible, fabulously risky, height-boosting procedure.<eos> What? What?<eos> Steve will be sliced into pieces, and when he's reassembled, he'll be exactly like the boy you remember, only taller and with a lot more bones... if he lives.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do? Yep.
Yes.<eos> Well, I must say, I think you're absolutely ideal.<eos> Did I mention that I also compose?<eos> - And he also composes.<eos> - Yes, I'm sure he does.<eos> Well, you know, there are some other candidates to hear, Bunny.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Some more.<eos> - Do you know any of them?<eos> - I do.
Cheddar already told y'all, we ain't here...<eos> Damn, nigga! You see that shit?<eos> He did it.<eos> He flipped it?<eos> He flipped it.<eos> Bring it in right here, homie. Whoo!<eos> All right!<eos> It's like black Jesus up in here.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Oh, my God! I just did a flip. Oh, my God!
You're just mad because they like Shark Tank more than they like Techtonic!<eos> What? No, no!<eos> I'm sorry. I just have a lot of personality.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, brother.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> First of all, I don't care if they like Shark Tank more than Techtonic.<eos> They're murderers!<eos> All right.<eos> Second of all, no, they don't!
Okay, one...<eos> I said the count of three.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> - I said the count of three.<eos> - I heard you say...<eos> - Yeah. - I heard it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We've killed people!<eos> Why "we"?<eos> Why "we"? No, you did it!
Oh, I didn't...<eos> I missed that part!<eos> You tell the story. You can tell...<eos> No, go on, please, go on.<eos> Okay, so... I mean, Joanne tells it better, but...<eos> So he pulls out this backpack... And inside is a like legit, full-on dead chicken.<eos> Not from a store, with feathers on it, newly dead.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We laughed so hard I thought I was gonna pee my pants.<eos> Joanne did.
Well, I tried...<eos> I tried shoving things up there.<eos> Er, me mum, she used to say she'd tie a knot in a bit of old flannel.<eos> I've had a go at that.<eos> I have heard of people using a bit of rolled-up cardboard.<eos> Even apples, some of them.<eos> Or a spud.<eos> So have I.<eos> - But you have to draw the line somewhere, don't you?<eos> - Yes, you do.
- I'm not.<eos> - I'm going home to Wales.<eos> - Really?<eos> There's nowhere suitable for her to live, Sister.<eos> She's been so poorly.<eos> Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
And it has been for an hour or more.<eos> Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> May he make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and grant you peace.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No. I didn't.
And it wasn't possible for us to save it.<eos> Did it die?<eos> Yes, Ruby.<eos> In my arms.<eos> Sister.<eos> Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
- It's a little girl.<eos> Oh, don't cut it yet!<eos> In a minute, then.<eos> There's worse things than being completely part of someone, being part of something bigger.<eos> Even just for a little while.<eos> But we know where we belong, don't we?<eos> - Are you coming with us? I shall be following behind, just to be on the safe side.<eos> But you don't need me -- you've got him.<eos> You really have -- and he knows how to take care of his family.<eos> Yes, I do.
Get down there.<eos> No, I need more information than that.<eos> What do we got, Chief? How many?<eos> Twenty to 40 attackers.<eos> State personnel separated in several positions.<eos> What's that?<eos> I hear AKs.<eos> RPGs.<eos> That's not good.<eos> What do I do?
Neat.<eos> Mariah?<eos> How the hell did you get in here?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Alone.<eos> So, this Luke Cage was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?<eos> Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.<eos> He was filling in for Dante that night.<eos> One man is linked to a criminal, the death of four people, the destruction of a restaurant, and you don't find him suspicious?<eos> Of course I do.
- Cornell is really good. - Mmm.<eos> Did I ask you anything, Little May?<eos> The girl's got a point.<eos> - She don't need you to defend her.<eos> - I know she don't.<eos> Because she's gonna be a lawyer, and she's gonna be able to defend her damn self.<eos> Ain't that right, baby?<eos> - Hey, Mariah.<eos> - Snap, crackle, pop!<eos> - How you doing, Henry?
Next to the dishwashing station.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.<eos> Nice sweatshirt.<eos> You box now?<eos> What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?<eos> Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black.<eos> HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!<eos> Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.<eos> He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt.<eos> Why you gotta stunt on me?<eos> No, I mean, seriously.<eos> Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me...<eos> - Right. - And I was on the run. - Why even get involved?<eos> But he did.
You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo?<eos> When it's cornered.<eos> I'm gonna rip your head off!<eos> "And behold a pale horse... and he that sat upon him, his name was Death."<eos> You really need a security system.<eos> - You waiting for me?<eos> - No.<eos> I bet he told you I was dead.<eos> Diamondback got to you, didn't he?<eos> No, he didn't.
- Ma... - Markie, you are here to be a student... and to study the Supreme Court and to prepare to go to law school.<eos> You are here so someday you will become... a person in the community that other people look up to... and that they come to for help.<eos> You are here so you don't have to be a Messner... and work in a butcher shop for the rest of your life.<eos> You are not here to look for trouble... with a girl who has taken a razor and slit her wrists.<eos> Wrist. She slit one wrist.<eos> One is enough.<eos> We have only two, and one is too much.<eos> Ma, you don't understand...<eos> - You think I don't understand?<eos> - You don't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Feel it.<eos> Isn't that fabric wonderful?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Aunt Poppy plans to spoil you rotten.<eos> These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Eureka!<eos> - This is yours, sister-in-law.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> I know where it came from.<eos> The robbery at the Chinese restaurant.<eos> I don't want a penny from the bastard who killed Antonio.<eos> What?<eos> You're a little tipsy, let's save the wine for later.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
That's Bambino, isn't it?<eos> That's Antonio.<eos> He heard us, he wants us to be okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Antonio.<eos> Antonio drove us crazy with this song.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - You have no rhythm.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
And so I've come to indulge mine.<eos> I've got to get back to Father.<eos> Dolores, no!<eos> Teddy.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> Just... just trying to look chivalrous.<eos> You're a low-down son of a bitch.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we both believe the same thing.<eos> No matter how dirty the business, do it well.
I'm handing Molly over to Andrew Cohen. - What?<eos> You've been absent lately, your paperwork is behind<eos> I know but I'm fine now - Are you?<eos> Andrew Cohen is a tosser.<eos> I'm a much better doctor than he is.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. But it's not negotiable.<eos> Thanks the vow of confidence, Tim.<eos> Anna, wait.<eos> I take it you know your patient Frank Henderson died last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm sorry, but...<eos> - Look, I'm a doctor.<eos> Just give me enough tablets until I get a prescription.<eos> Have you seen your sister today?<eos> Why don't you ask the Ferrells?<eos> She one of them now, ain't she?<eos> What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night? Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
What does that mean?<eos> Max said you were talking about Dr McKenzie.<eos> - I asked her.<eos> - What?<eos> What did you ask her?<eos> I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, no, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
There's nothing to sort out, there's nothing to try and get through. There's nothing. There's just...<eos> I used to look at you and think that that was the worst thing. The not knowing.<eos> - It is.<eos> -No, it's not.<eos> I've got nothing now.<eos> Nothing.<eos> At least you've still got hope.<eos> ♪ Over and over<eos> Anna has homework.<eos> No I don't.
My boy.<eos> - Roy!<eos> Jesus, Max, calm down.<eos> Somebody knows.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead.<eos> Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
I'll have a look around.<eos> There's something not quite right around here, Fergus.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It's the lights.<eos> - They always bring trouble.<eos> You can see here the indentation on the head, - neck and lower spine. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Weapon?<eos> - Some kind of angled iron. - Maybe part of a machine or...<eos> - So basically you don't know.<eos> No I don't.
Why would I?<eos> Were you stalking her?<eos> If this is all coming from Eliza Grayson, - I will fucking...<eos> - What?<eos> What'll you do?<eos> Sack her, 'cause she's a lying bitch.<eos> It's her you should be investigating.<eos> Look, I want to have a talk to your boss.<eos> Don't have a boss.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You never liked Travis.<eos> He's never stood up beside the likes of Max or the other men in this town.<eos> You think I don't know how you and the others talk about him?<eos> We worry about you.<eos> Don't.<eos> Be happy for me.<eos> What do you really want, Barbara?<eos> I want to know what happened to Chloe.<eos> I'm sorry. Of course you do.<eos> We all do... We all...
Never mind.<eos> He's probably at the Cygnet office.<eos> Fergus?<eos> Think we can rule out a university professor.<eos> More than half the town still thinks Anna did it, you know?<eos> So?<eos> More than half the town believes in spaceships.<eos> But you don't believe she did it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I've got Grayson in there waiting for us.<eos> Found an imprint on one of the threat letters.<eos> It's his signature.<eos> You are a man of mystery, Fergus, you know that?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Depends.<eos> Did you write these letters to Max Holloway?<eos> Yes. I did.<eos> Did you kill Chloe Holloway?<eos> No, I did not.
Dangerous.<eos> Besides, it ain't what the Heavenly Father wants for us.<eos> Come on now. Have some more of that chicken.<eos> Looks real good.<eos> Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
I think I've a notion of who you're wantin' for this.<eos> I've not seen my cousin anywhere since this whole thing started.<eos> Pains me to say it,<eos> but that's what I'm figurin'.<eos> Your own blood.<eos> He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
I want life with you.<eos> You ain't safe here.<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen.<eos> You need to run from this place, fast and as far as you can before death catches up with you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> It will.<eos> It always does.
Bring these two.<eos> I'll see to it they get home.<eos> Anyone who wants to leave here is free to go.<eos> You are not indentured to me like you were to Chang.<eos> But know this, if anyone leaves here, even for an hour, you ain't got a job when you get back.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Mr. Lee, you been with the Central Pacific since Sacramento, you got us through the desert.<eos> You're gonna want to see it finished.<eos> Chinaman need long work, Bossman.<eos> Railroad done.
You can end this.<eos> Just leave me here and make a run for it.<eos> I don't like to leave things unfinished.<eos> You're a therapist.<eos> Oh, did I give that away with "aberrant functional connectivity"?<eos> How many times have you told your patients that just because they make one mistake doesn't mean they have to make two?<eos> Hundreds of times, darling.<eos> But I talk to prisoners.<eos> They rarely listen.<eos> - And when they do?
Maura was trying to tell us about a tunnel.<eos> But not a tunnel that was exposed to temperature variations.<eos> Our paint chip had never been exposed to high temperatures.<eos> Which means car tunnels are out.<eos> Those are like ovens in the summer.<eos> Yeah, we searched the entire Asylum.<eos> There aren't any tunnels here.<eos> That's because according to the blueprints,<eos> Arkush doesn't have tunnels.<eos> Sure, it does.
Uh, don't worry.<eos> I'm... I'm fine.<eos> You went through hell.<eos> Nobody expects you to be fine.<eos> Please don't say anything to Jane.<eos> - I-I don't want her worrying about me.<eos> - Like you could ever stop her?<eos> But I, uh... I understand.<eos> You know how much I care about you, Maura?<eos> - I do.
I'm moving too fast.<eos> I-I got swept up, and I-I pushed for something that you're not ready for.<eos> No, no, that's not it.<eos> I would love to go away with you.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
That's a beauty.<eos> Yeah, a guy named McDonald.<eos> - That's clearly not the case.<eos> - So, you don't have a check for $1.35 million dollars in your pocket?<eos> Bye, Dick.<eos> - So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> - I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
He has been in touch with a police highway dispatcher, saying he wants to be taken to his mother.<eos> He wants to see her.<eos> Um, but we don't know what the resolution of all of this will be.<eos> All right, what do you want me to do, O.J.?<eos> - I should die. - No.<eos> Put the gun down, Juice.<eos> I'm tired of you drivin' me around, A.C.!<eos> Tell me what you need!<eos> - Take me to the cemetery. - No, man.<eos> We did that already.
Sorry about the Colombian necktie thing.<eos> I hadn't ever heard of it.<eos> You're kidding me, Tom.<eos> You didn't know that Mezzaluna was a cleverly-disguised front for the gatherings of cocaine kingpins?<eos> That Faye Resnick owed them money on some deal she was mixed up in?<eos> And these Scarfaces decided to scare her by killing Nicole?<eos> How could you not know there's a major drug cartel being run out of a B-minus Brentwood eatery, right under your nose?<eos> It's just desperate flailing.<eos> I hope they keep that kind of unsubstantiated bullshit up.<eos> I don't.
So, it was Bob Shapiro who made you live a double life while you were married with Barbara?<eos> I shut the press right down today, baby.<eos> You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.<eos> My pastor didn't, Johnnie. Baby, I'll find out...<eos> I'll find out what happened, I'll find out who did this...<eos> Nobody did this!
People are hungry.<eos> I was putting Charles to sleep.<eos> I'll come down, but not with you like this.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Tommy.<eos> I thought today was the reason for the way you've been acting lately.<eos> I know there's business on your mind.<eos> And I know there always will be. - Yeah.<eos> - Look. I am sorry they wore their uniforms.<eos> Yeah, they fucking did, eh? They fucking did.
There are more than three other houses in the North...<eos> Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.<eos> Two dozen more.<eos> Together they equal all the others.<eos> We can start small and build.<eos> The North remembers.<eos> They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
You're right.<eos> I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.<eos> Good.<eos> I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.<eos> And now we must fight them together.<eos> We need each other.<eos> I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.<eos> At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years.<eos> Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?<eos> I do.
Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.<eos> You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't.<eos> And you've got women.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Fight them?<eos> Kill them?<eos> It'd be you against all of them.<eos> I mean, these people don't know how to fight.<eos> You do.
The Breakline is no place for an Elf.<eos> It's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it.<eos> Diana.<eos> How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.<eos> If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
-Do I?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Okay. Well, I'm, like, so sorry to be affectionate to you.<eos> -I guess that's-- -No, it's not affection, it's pressure.<eos> Because then if I don't say it back then it becomes a thing.<eos> Well, why wouldn't you say it back?<eos> I mean, if it's true you would say it, right?<eos> 'Cause I, like, I love you.<eos> Oh, my God, please stop saying that.<eos> -Okay, well, I do.
Mostly I unclog people's toilets.<eos> Keeps me grounded.<eos> Well... you seem good.<eos> You always had that look in your eye.<eos> Like you knew something about the world that other people didn't.<eos> You're talking about me in the past tense.<eos> Look, I didn't know what to expect coming here.<eos> I mean, when I saw you the other night, you seemed different.<eos> Well, you just said I seemed good. You do, okay?<eos> You do. Just...
Near school and hospital.<eos> Ideal for learning.<eos> I want to be now you're sick you.<eos> - And I want you to get your degree.<eos> You must my son...<eos> - He will me being sausage.<eos> Consider your tone.<eos> He wants to help you.<eos> I do not need help.<eos> But I do.
Help me to the refuge.<eos> Let me stand by His Holiness as I have stood by him since his birth.<eos> We cannot take the chance.<eos> Mongols!<eos> You.<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> - We're close.<eos> - You know you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Now they say you are going to Timbuktu to study.<eos> Far, far away.<eos> Instead of serving the king or taking a wife.<eos> Jinna.<eos> Look, will you slow down?<eos> I agree.<eos> And you should only choose the right warrior.<eos> Jinna, I'm the right warrior.<eos> You know this.<eos> We both do.
These belong to people.<eos> - So did that piano.<eos> - Jasper.<eos> Jasper! Grave robbers!<eos> Get off of him!<eos> - Take it easy. Enough!<eos> We have to move it.<eos> Wait. It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
Maybe your fuckin' best isn't good enough, Tad.<eos> I need your bosom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, Tad, what does it matter, anyway?<eos> You know, just a bunch of fuckin' assholes out there just getting whatever they want while the rest of us just rot.<eos> Look at me, I'm just trying to live my life, be a good person, and the rich keep getting richer while I turn to dust on Bleecker Street, you know?<eos> Fuckin' Tad, you know, I just want to be happy.<eos> Is that w... I mean, I just want to be happy.<eos> I just want one day where I just feel good.<eos> Of course, of course you do.
Were you serious?<eos> About what?<eos> About homecoming.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure I was. I mean, we could go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.
Helene--you know, she knows what she wants.<eos> She doesn't second-guess herself.<eos> It's really sexy.<eos> See if it's safe to leave?<eos> - I want to have sex with you.<eos> - We don't need that.<eos> - I'm on the pill.<eos> - Cool.<eos> You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> - You do.
A man who wants to live a clean life, here you are signing up for the biggest robbery of all.<eos> I have to hand it to you, Tom, you're a smart man...<eos> Are you in or out, Charlie?<eos> Curly?<eos> - Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
Uh, she had informed me earlier that day that she was pregnant.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Detective Gordon, within hours of your encounter, Theo Galavan was found beaten and shot to death.<eos> Were you present at the time of his murder?<eos> Ah, well, here we are.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Do you have any information regarding the case that you have not shared with us?<eos> This is for my mother.<eos> No, I do not.
No, he wasn't.<eos> The driver wasn't drunk. He hit us on purpose.<eos> But I think you know that because you paid for his lawyer.<eos> Still think we have nothing to talk about?<eos> If you have a question for me, son... why not go ahead and ask it?<eos> Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
One way or the other, she intrigues me.<eos> Well, if you would allow us to apply rigorous dream therapy, we would know, for sure.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> We do have a very useful hammer, Ms. Peabody, but not all of our patients are nails.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What the hell happened last night?<eos> Stumbled onto a mugging.<eos> And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.<eos> Where'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
Hush, now.<eos> Life is full of uncertainty.<eos> And if something does happen, we're always here.<eos> Off you go.<eos> If you keep releasing lunatics so liberally, you're going to get a bad reputation.<eos> I'm not looking for a good reputation.<eos> We're releasing Barbara Kean into the wild to observe her behavior.<eos> She's a beautiful experiment.<eos> You know what she's going to do, don't you?<eos> I don't, actually.
But who hired him?<eos> Why?<eos> I need to find out. Sometimes we never find out. It happens.<eos> I need you to give me the Wayne files.<eos> You take this, and I'll give you the Wayne files.<eos> Call her.<eos> I'll go get 'em.<eos> It was nothing that you did or didn't do, Alfred.<eos> Why I went away. I want you to know that.<eos> I do.
We should get back to work.<eos> Or we could fall asleep for five to seven days and see how we feel.<eos> I will not rest till justice is served.<eos> There's no time to waste.<eos> This case is urgent.<eos> Oh, boy. All right, listen.<eos> The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> I did. I did.
Judy!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> No, not again!<eos> Judy!<eos> Judy!<eos> Where is Judy?<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> He has to be somewhere on this boat.<eos> Peralta!<eos> No, he doesn't.
It's only a highway holding all your body's nerves.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You guys have an extra mouse for my computer?<eos> No.<eos> But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.<eos> Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop.<eos> Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
It's not Pimento.<eos> Get out of there, Jake!<eos> Thanks, Rosa.<eos> So Detective Pimento didn't show up for work today.<eos> Any idea why?<eos> Oh, yeah, I straight up drove him off.<eos> Big screw-up on my part.<eos> I'm trying this new thing where I just own my mistakes.<eos> - I like it.<eos> Do you?
Well, the key is trust.<eos> I trust her to stay out of danger, and she trusts me not to interfere.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She just pushed Figgis into the garbage.<eos> She's in danger. I must interfere.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?<eos> Showing my unborn baby how an ass gets kicked. [growls]<eos> All right, Cortez, time for your checkup.<eos> [sighs] No, thank you, I feel fine.<eos> No, you don't.
We used to disco dance all the time.<eos> I guess you got too busy lately.<eos> Ah, well, it's a little embarrassing, but my son's having problems.<eos> What kind of problems, Big Ronnie?<eos> Between you and me, I think my son's a severe manic depressive.<eos> He should be on medication.<eos> And did I tell you he still craps the bed most nights?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> No, you did not.
And what?<eos> "And" as in it sounded as if there was more to that thought.<eos> That you might see yourself agreeing with him again... about my capacity.<eos> There wasn't any more to that thought, was there?<eos> Signal!<eos> On the flagship's mainmast!<eos> They're showing her fleet identification, asking us to verify who we are.<eos> Get my log from below.<eos> You have the proper codes to respond?<eos> I do.
Hold on.<eos> 'Iraq and Kuwait had shared a tense relationship for some time.'<eos> 'The tension was caused by what always causes tension'<eos> 'Money.'<eos> 'Iraq owed Kuwait 14 billion dollars...' '...that Iraq wanted waived.'<eos> Okay, I'll call you later. 'They were also demanding that Kuwait produce less oil...' '...so that oil prices go up...' '...and Iraq profits more.'<eos> 'Amidst these apologies and threats...' '...the Iraqis also accused the Kuwaitis of... '...stealing oil.'<eos> 'We had grown used to these threats by now.' 'And believed that the situation wouldn't change'<eos> 'But we were wrong.'<eos> 'It did.'
If I hadn't passed through that checkpoint today then you wouldn't be still alive, Mr. Ranjit.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> You didn't recognise me.<eos> A year ago...you came to Baghdad with your wife Amrita and daughter Simran for a Fundraiser.<eos> And by the grace of Allah... who was your security in-charge?<eos> I was with you for two days yet you don't recognise me.<eos> I am kind of hurt, Mr. Katiyal.<eos> I remember...<eos> - No!<eos> You don't!
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a jerk.<eos> - I just feel like a bad friend.<eos> - Hey, stop talking like that.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> The two of you will go away, have a nice time.<eos> It'll be good for you. What?<eos> I like Anna.<eos> - No you don't.<eos> - I do.
That's quite an idea.<eos> So?<eos> It might be the kind of change I'm looking for.<eos> Yeah, look, I'll... I'll think about it.<eos> Oh, that reminds me.<eos> Boris wanted me to give you this.<eos> It's probably another list of tasks he needs me to tend to in his absence.<eos> I don't know why he doesn't just e-mail me this stuff.<eos> He's old-school. - You want to hear it?<eos> - I do.
These are for you.<eos> Richard Roper was recently a guest at the Meisters Hotel.<eos> Do whatever you want with those.<eos> I don't want to be involved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
"Something to do with agricultural hardware.<eos> "Quick profits.<eos> He's my gift to you.<eos> "He's clever. He's handsome.<eos> "He's good with all the right people.<eos> "Didn't want you missing out.<eos> "The Company is called Tradepass.<eos> "Double your money in four months, max."<eos> It's trust Dicky time.<eos> And they do.
Yeah, no shit, doll-face.<eos> I was doin' the chopping'.<eos> So then... you don't wanna read that book to me?<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Shit on a biscuit!<eos> Colorful language.<eos> You've always been good with words.<eos> Don't act like you know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I'm done talking to you.<eos> I'm done... with you.<eos> - Forever.<eos> - You're not done.<eos> Sit down. You really think you're my mother, don't you, you crazy, murderous bitch?<eos> You're not. She's dead.<eos> Maybe you'll have something in common with her soon.<eos> Goodbye, Ann.<eos> It's open.<eos> How you doing?
Yeah?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> Plead insanity. You'll have no trouble convincing a jury.<eos> If you're lucky, you just might get life in prison.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You just couldn't leave it alone, could you?<eos> You were almost free and clear.<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.
They did say there was no, uh, permanent nerve damage, though.<eos> The dog was not so lucky.<eos> Well... what the hell? He was trying to kill me, so... I blew his head off.<eos> Good thing he didn't go for my shooter hand, though.<eos> I would've been gone.<eos> Scary thing about this hallway... there are no cameras.<eos> Uhh! Oh, yeah. Come on, try something.<eos> Give me the chance.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> That professor, your dog attack, the taxi... nothing to do with me.
She...<eos> She what?<eos> Look, man, I get it.<eos> You've been through a lot lately.<eos> What do you say we get out of here and get some much needed RR?<eos> We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh...<eos> Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
I have to go to London.<eos> You shut up!<eos> Killed your mother!<eos> I want to go to London!<eos> Going to London, fuckers!<eos> Open the door, Monty.<eos> - I say open the door.<eos> - Please, sir.<eos> Please, sir. Stop.<eos> - Please don't.
I'm here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I can't keep coming around. Then, don't.<eos> Maybe we should get a hotel next time.<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, it'd just be easier, that's all.<eos> You should go.<eos> Yeah, I'm going to go shower first.<eos> So, you have the money?<eos> I do.
I meant to tell you, I enjoyed your TED Talk.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> Thanks for watching. You're so successful.<eos> Well, I'm still a cop, which is not that bad.<eos> You know, it's a lot of rules now.<eos> We gotta wear body cameras and all of that.<eos> I don't know why they gave me one. It's not like I'm gonna shoot myself.<eos> But, hey, I figured if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.<eos> What are you up to, man?<eos> How you doing?
Every time I try to get out of this motherfucking place, some shit goes down and I get stuck in it.<eos> I'm getting while the getting's good.<eos> But before I do... figured I'd pay my tab.<eos> Where the hell did you get this?<eos> Now, you know better than to ask.<eos> Point is, you spent your retirement fund getting me out. Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.
To choose or be chosen.<eos> And then, that's our lives settled...for ever.<eos> It's frightening.<eos> You just have to choose right, that's all.<eos> But how will I know?<eos> You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
A hunter, what do you mean?<eos> I mean he doesn't just skin people for the hell of it.<eos> Okay, look for poachers, wildlife traffickers, black-markma smugglers, maybe even big game hunters.<eos> Seems our killer thinks I'm the ultimate trophy kill.<eos> Got tired of waiting for you to wake up, Detective Chandler.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, I think you know who I am, what I want.<eos> The creature, the beast.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
Actually, um, well, you know Free City, Laura Parks' charity?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - We understand that Mr. Noonan was incredibly devoted to that charity.<eos> - We also understand that he was... incredibly devoted to Laura Parks.<eos> Did you know the IRS was investigating Free City for misappropriation of funds?<eos> What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
Like when you... took credit for all of our work.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Prometheus?<eos> Thief of fire.<eos> Does it ring a bell, Ken?<eos> You stole my ideas and you pawned them off as your own.<eos> What ideas?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> You know just as well as I do, Ken.<eos> No, I don't.
Office hours are at 3:00.<eos> Dawes?<eos> Police. We need to talk to you.<eos> I did go by her parents' place.<eos> How come?<eos> Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
I kind of bullied him into telling me.<eos> And guess what the atmosphere of Mars consists of mostly.<eos> - Carbon...<eos> - Dioxide.<eos> Exactly. Now you said she died last Friday.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That facility was on lockdown.<eos> No one coming in, no one going out, which means if she was murdered, someone on the inside did it.<eos> And that narrows down our list of suspects.<eos> Yes, it does.
I'm gonna give it another 20 minutes.<eos> I don't wanna come home empty-handed.<eos> All right.<eos> Love you too.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want it.<eos> You're in over your head, cop.<eos> Trust me, you don't wanna do this.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
Maybe he knew about Russo framing Tendler.<eos> He was gonna give sealed testimony in front of a closed grand jury.<eos> You think Sandra Russo, a decorated police officer, our captain, murdered Shane Barton to cover a lie that she told?<eos> This is a lot to swallow, Al.<eos> We have to follow the evidence, and the evidence right now points to her as the prime suspect.<eos> I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
This is a surprise. Yeah, I know, Reverend.<eos> It's, uh, been a long time.<eos> I didn't know you were in town.<eos> Yeah, um... back about five months now.<eos> I wish we were seeing each other under different circumstances, but I'm glad you're here.<eos> Hold on, Reverend.<eos> I didn't come to see the boy. Not to help, at least.<eos> I came 'cause...<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Sure you do.
Is that why you came back to Rome?<eos> I heard you had a family.<eos> Things were going good for you.<eos> Maybe I just missed the house.<eos> I read scripture to him. It didn't do anything.<eos> Holy water irritated him severely, but had no long-term effect.<eos> Will you pray with me?<eos> You are very brave to return.<eos> He doesn't like the light.<eos> My mother didn't either.
He's got his best bow tie on and everything.<eos> I figured you could put it up with your collecti... wait a minute.<eos> What happened to all your figurines?<eos> - Just needed the space. - Yeah?<eos> It's very sweet, baby. Thank you.<eos> I mean, you don't have to have it on display or anything.<eos> No, you know what? I got the perfect spot for it.<eos> It's the trash, isn't it?<eos> There. Now you can see it every time you do the dishes.<eos> - Oh, yeah? Every time I do the dishes?
Karl seems to be settled in his new job.<eos> It was OK for the first month after Adam's death, but he's getting restless now.<eos> Missing the investigating.<eos> I'll wash up.<eos> This is how we do things when I eat with my boyfriend.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> I just didn't think you were the boyfriend type. I'm trying it out.<eos> And?<eos> Sometimes he talks when I don't want him to. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do that.
All Lutz here can do is boost your sense of humor about how fucked you are.<eos> Anything deeper than that, you need a trip to behavior, so go blackmail a couple of techs up there.<eos> Then you can be someone else's problem.<eos> I don't have time for that, so I'm going to need you to take me there.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> There's a window during shift change.<eos> No one will notice.<eos> The things I need you to change are quite sophisticated, but I'll write them down for you.<eos> And then, like you said... I can be someone else's problem.<eos> All right, we do this thing.
When were you going to tell us about this experiment?<eos> Today.<eos> This morning.<eos> I admit I got a little ahead of myself. A little exuberant and for that, I apologize. But the headline here is, I think we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls since this one airing.<eos> Cliff, since you and I spoke last night, 72 more.<eos> You hear that? Right there.<eos> - That's the sound of victory.<eos> - Jimmy, stop selling.<eos> And don't act like you don't see the problem here.<eos> - I don't.
Really?<eos> From where?<eos> Schweikart and Cokely.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off my law-school loans.<eos> That's great. Please let me be there when you tell Howard.<eos> Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, o-of course I do.
I heard they were in need of people with my skills.<eos> So, as I had time today, I went and volunteered.<eos> Mother Hildegarde, she's the matron, she's a complete force of nature.<eos> She was a musical prodigy and goddaughter of King Louis' great-grandfather.<eos> She's not going to make it easy for me, but when she saw me taste the urine, the tides began to turn.<eos> I haven't won her over yet, but I will.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Did ye now?<eos> Well, yes, I did.
You mean sleep with my husband?<eos> But my lover would be furious.<eos> Well, he's not the one that's pregnant, Louise.<eos> But how will I raise a child with a man who is not the father?<eos> All that matters is that... the child is brought up with love.<eos> Good evening, my beautiful wife.<eos> And how was the rest of your day since last we met?<eos> Not bad.<eos> I take it you had a good day.<eos> Aye, as a matter of fact, I did.
We can bring them with us.<eos> All of them?<eos> What of our tenants?<eos> Leave them to the--the mercy of the British butchers if the Culloden is lost?<eos> - Your name on that document brands you as a traitor to the British.<eos> And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
He was a bastard.<eos> Acknowledged by his father, Lord Lovat, but a bastard nonetheless.<eos> And your grandmother?<eos> Lord Lovat's kitchen maid.<eos> She raised my father at Beaufort Castle.<eos> I should've told ye before we wed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was cowardly of me. Jamie, you must know your father's parentage makes no difference to me.<eos> Hm. Well... it should.<eos> It doesn't.
Dismissed!<eos> Move it!<eos> Bloody sheep.<eos> A word with ye, Uncle.<eos> Listen, lad, I ken ye're trying to do what ye think is best, but I was teaching men to fight while you were still sucking your mother's tit, God rest her.<eos> So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I ken what these men will face, and I know how to prepare them for it.<eos> You don't.
My husband and I share everything.<eos> He knows about your offer... and he knows why I was forced to make the decision I did.<eos> And he took no issue with it?<eos> None.<eos> Well, he, uh... He is a better man than I.<eos> Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
Tell him to come back straightaway to speak with Mr. Anderson.<eos> Here, you say?<eos> Aye. Or thereabouts.<eos> I don't ken much from maps.<eos> There's no such path marked.<eos> Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?<eos> Aye, I do.
What's inside there?<eos> Oh. That opens?<eos> Yes. Maybe there's food in there.<eos> Is there food in there?<eos> Uh, no, just... Just this water gun.<eos> That's not a water gun, man, that's a flare gun, which I'll hold onto for safekeeping.<eos> Uh... Why?<eos> Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun. Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
- The sun is actually coming through the heavy cloud covers. Well, not as the sun, but just as kind of like a.. Mozzie dot out in the sky.<eos> It's not giving any heat, that's for sure.<eos> Make sure that your water, for your dog in the bowl.. It's not frozen.<eos> A terrible thing happened..<eos> Like three dogs.. It was so cold, it was like 5 degrees in the morning. Three dogs got brought to the vets..<eos> - I thought you had to be back at work.<eos> -I do.
-Okay.<eos> -Okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Eight months of telling him, and now it's okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> - I was expecting your voicemail.<eos> -Ha, you got me.<eos> - I thought you had a meeting.<eos> -I do.
She's the one I can do without.<eos> The moment I believe you are no longer necessary to this endeavor, you go on that ship, that ship turns back for London, and soon thereafter, you swing over Wapping.<eos> Except that you can't actually do any of those things.<eos> No?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you don't know that Samuel Wayne has never once paid for a drink.<eos> Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know. You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
I understand why you did it.<eos> I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.<eos> The temptation to keep something to show for it all,<eos> I understand it. But it does not change the reality we face.<eos> That you face.<eos> For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> It never does.
It was all a misunderstanding.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> You told me that that man was taken to task by her bodyguard.<eos> Was that not the case?<eos> Dobbs assaulted him.<eos> He believes him responsible for choosing the men to be interrogated by them.<eos> I didn't mention it to you because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just didn't.
Darkness.<eos> Hate.<eos> Showing indifference to the authority that you sacrificed so much to acquire, disdain for refusing to acknowledge that his actions, had you not intervened, would have led to an outcome that he would have held you responsible for reversing.<eos> Pride.<eos> Questioning what kind of man you are if you don't seek retribution for the offense.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> You saying I went too far with him?<eos> Maybe you went too far.<eos> Maybe you didn't go far enough.<eos> Maybe you did it just right.
When I realized the escort was Brazilian, I asked her to teach me how to say a few things.<eos> You've never been married.<eos> You don't know how bad it could get.<eos> Wozniak doesn't know anything.<eos> Only that we accessed his inner circle.<eos> There's a rat on my team!<eos> You're about to move a lot of illegal cash.<eos> You need to get this buttoned up.<eos> I need to know if you're still in.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- He's gonna lay low.<eos> - Best-case scenario.<eos> Worst-case scenario, he contacts Wozniak.<eos> He won't risk using his phone, which means he'll do it in person.<eos> If we surveil Wozniak and Saperstein shows up, we're not gonna have any choice but to intervene.<eos> Operation over.<eos> So, what, we go back to questioning Mom? No.<eos> We put out a federal warrant.<eos> His crew sees a Fed warrant, he might as well have a target on his back.<eos> He already does.
If that goes viral, everyone in America sees you smoking weed.<eos> If it gets those cops punished, who cares?<eos> Uh, colleges.<eos> Future employers.<eos> This is about the rest of your life.<eos> That matters to me.<eos> Good guys take down bad guys.<eos> That should also matter.<eos> It's what I thought you did.<eos> I do.
Protective custody.<eos> Is that what you guys call it?<eos> Usually the person in custody doesn't run from the protection.<eos> You can find me on my subway car in the middle of the night, but securing one police officer...<eos> I did what you asked me to do.<eos> Saperstein chose to rely on Wozniak's mercy.<eos> So you tip the scales?<eos> Issue a federal warrant?<eos> I needed to apprehend Saperstein before he got to Wozniak.<eos> Yes, you did.
No.<eos> Harlee, we can't undo what's already been done.<eos> No!<eos> Harlee, we need to move forward.<eos> He might not remember, okay?<eos> They don't even know how much brain damage he has.<eos> He might not even wake up!<eos> - I can't take that chance.<eos> - You have to.<eos> We both do, okay?
You want to help me up?<eos> It's a controlled explosion, all right?<eos> An old warehouse scheduled for demolition.<eos> Nobody gets hurt.<eos> Pick-up, delivery, security.<eos> That's what the deal was.<eos> You want to explain to me what happened with Harlee?<eos> I told you, I was wrong.<eos> Hey! I need to know if you're still in.<eos> Yeah, you do.
All right, listen up.<eos> I am bloated. I'm cramping. My shoes are killing me, and my husband's cheating on me.<eos> And I have to go apologize to the bitch that he's been screwing.<eos> I'm gonna kill someone before this day is over.<eos> Bernard did it.<eos> It wasn't right, what he said about Wozniak's daughter.<eos> My cousin committed suicide.<eos> - His father was a tough guy, loyal, and a little scary.<eos> You gonna ask me if I know any men like that?<eos> Do you?
You didn't hear, Bernard?<eos> That bitch tapped out.<eos> I'm in the ring now.<eos> You ain't stabbing people at the bodega.<eos> - You in my house.<eos> - Can't hide behind you forever.<eos> That punk's gonna have to see me on the block!<eos> In the cell block, then you're headed for the other one.<eos> Didn't your mother tell you not to stab people?<eos> My mama did.
Wow.<eos> I-- that's a dress.<eos> [chuckles] - You look great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I ordered something in French.<eos> Sounded like detergent.<eos> [laughs] That's what I get for being late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you wanted to talk about a case.<eos> I do.
That Miguel was innocent?<eos> I keep my promises, Harlee.<eos> So your partner, then?<eos> She is scared of her own shadow.<eos> She wouldn't do that.<eos> She doesn't have enough information to make something like that happen.<eos> So the prosecution just let him out?<eos> Last we argued, your boyfriend played for that team.<eos> We've argued since then, and he's not my boyfriend.<eos> He didn't do this.
If you decide to sell, we can offer your buyer very competitive rates.<eos> We were railroaded.<eos> There was no going backwards.<eos> We were trapped.<eos> We'll never get back what we paid for this.<eos> Those swamp people would buy it tomorrow if we gave 'em a holler.<eos> No way.<eos> Oh, I feel sick to my stomach.<eos> I didn't think it could get any worse.<eos> Then it did.
- Stop it. - Shoot me.<eos> - Throw it out the window.<eos> - He can't do that.<eos> He knows the answer he needs is inside.<eos> He throws it out, he has nothing, and I win.<eos> Tick-took, tick-tock, brother.<eos> Here I am, an open book with all the information right there in front of you.<eos> "If a tree falls in the park and there's no one to hear, it is silent, invisible, and nameless."<eos> - Philosophy.<eos> - Do it.
I think you didn't do it.<eos> These guys, they'll skin you alive.<eos> Make you watch in a mirror while they do it.<eos> What guys?<eos> You ever hear of Armenian Power in LA?<eos> - No.<eos> - Their top guy.<eos> No way that motherfucker was going to jail, huh?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> So, you didn't do it?
Look. Yeah, we did.<eos> But what I'm saying is I was transformed.<eos> Stephy opened up like a flower.<eos> You should have seen it.<eos> I shouldn't have seen it, but now I feel like I have.<eos> I just want your parents to know that you're living with someone who's completely devoted to you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What-ing with someone?<eos> You say you're living together?<eos> Yeah. No. We do not.
I did.<eos> How?<eos> My sling.<eos> And cleared your family's debt in the doing.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Perhaps we can find something for you here at the palace.<eos> You are a shepherd, you say?<eos> Yes, my queen.<eos> Do you play the harp?<eos> Many shepherds do.
You are not the Lord.<eos> I am the prophet.<eos> And I am the king!<eos> You do not question His will.<eos> Then, if He cannot be questioned... what is His purpose?<eos> The Lord I revere does not slaughter women and children.<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> No.<eos> No, I do not.
Used to belong to a biker gang; the feds busted 'em, and the bank foreclosed on the property.<eos> This is Hap and Leonard.<eos> They're with us.<eos> - Hey. I ain't giving my share to no whales.<eos> I read "Moby Dick." I was rooting for Ahab.<eos> This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
Sure, something to begin with.<eos> If something comes in the mail room I could let you know.<eos> There is nothing here now then?<eos> Unless...<eos> I put you on working for me.<eos> We can come up with some title...<eos> I always have some errands to run...<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> You know anybody in town?<eos> No, I don't.
I would have married him but he was a dope addict.<eos> I don't like dope.<eos> It messes you up.<eos> I tried it a few times when I was with him.<eos> We smoked weed first and I even tried opium once.<eos> Look at you!<eos> What was the effect?<eos> I didn't Ike it.<eos> I don't have an addictive personality.<eos> He did.
I think I know why that bowl was there.<eos> And it relates to the modus operandi of<eos> Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.<eos> Are you sure he killed all those girls?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
Please, Mummy.<eos> How much is a taxi?<eos> It'll be, like, a fiver.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You missed your exam.<eos> You're a fucking brunette now? Yeah, why not?<eos> Why have you been telling lies about Paul?<eos> I haven't.<eos> You said he left comments on your videos.<eos> He did.
No.<eos> That was Edgar and Ferras.<eos> I was just along for the ride.<eos> Good man, Mank.<eos> Friend of yours.<eos> Lucky he saw Captain Pounds grab you first, huh?<eos> And wasn't afraid to say so.<eos> You think maybe you over-reacted?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I don't.
Got jammed up by IA, on some petty bullshit.<eos> Had to resign.<eos> Went from working murders to working the gate for a bunch of rich people.<eos> Talk about losing what you got.<eos> - Thanks, Carl.<eos> - It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
She could have 10 kids.<eos> She could be a he. I don't care.<eos> I think you should move closer, "Chelsea".<eos> Okay, "Ryan".<eos> How was your day?<eos> Are you on the pill?<eos> Yes...<eos> But I'd like to use a condom.<eos> Yeah, I don't have any.<eos> I do.
If I don't win this vote, Rate will challenge me to single combat.<eos> - You'll win the vote.<eos> - We can't know that.<eos> Rate.<eos> You're still here?<eos> You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
Self destruct in four minutes.<eos> This whole place is gonna blow!<eos> Welcome to Project 880.<eos> Self destruct in two minutes.<eos> -Jim. -Lewis.<eos> Lewis, what happened?<eos> Who did this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We kept filming like you said.<eos> -I did?
That's just great.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Good. But until then, no footage, no proof.<eos> Look, I'm not making this up, you dick.<eos> Okay. So then tell me this. Why didn't you just stick around and find out what was going on, before you came back and started scaring everybody?<eos> Because the lab was about to explode.<eos> Somebody set the lab to self destruct.<eos> Right.<eos> We don't have a self destruct.<eos> No, actually we do.
No.<eos> You see that, right?<eos> That's recording us, and it will be used in court.<eos> How do you think that's gonna come on?<eos> "She was nice, I liked her, but I killed her anyway."<eos> Detective, what made you so sure so quickly Nasir Khan was your man?<eos> The mountain of evidence.<eos> So why bother questioning him?<eos> Sometimes a suspect wants nothing more than to confess.<eos> - Did he?
How's the hand?<eos> Y-You can't enter the private quarters.<eos> Beowulf, you have no place here.<eos> Bayen. I just want to see Hrothgar.<eos> You heard Rheda.<eos> How many years were you a Shieldman?<eos> - 30?<eos> - And Reeve for ten.<eos> Not only that, I helped him teach his son, and you, one end of a sword from another, if you remember.<eos> I do.
Beowulf...<eos> I never thanked you. You saved my life.<eos> I wasn't there for you. I was there for the beast.<eos> Still... thank you.<eos> - May I ask you a question?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Are you Slean's woman?<eos> Only, I saw him leave your home this morning.<eos> You did?<eos> I did.
I take it there are no objections from the defense?<eos> - No, Your Honor.<eos> - Motion granted.<eos> All charges are dismissed.<eos> These men are to be released from custody immediately.<eos> I am free.<eos> Home and free.<eos> Mr. Prosecutor, I'd like a word in my chambers.<eos> Hey, Bunker.<eos> How you doing?
You want to check out some of the posters or, you know, some of the DVDs?<eos> I'm gonna get us some cocktails and then we're gonna start the audition, okay?<eos> We're gonna make it vodka.<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> You got me.<eos> You got me, lady.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.<eos> Give me and Sugar a minute.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were just doing what we all wanted to.<eos> Just everybody disappeared all at once.<eos> You know?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Job knew the risks.<eos> We all did.
So how you doing?<eos> - You look better.<eos> - Yeah, I'm a real fashion plate.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - What about me?<eos> I hear you went native while I was away. - Yeah.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
- Get lost.<eos> It's over, Ayan.<eos> It's over.<eos> I lied...<eos> First to you then to myself.<eos> I lied that I don't have place for love...<eos> I'm falling in love with you, Ayan...<eos> And today, I finally understood that you can never love me the way you love Alizeh...<eos> I love you...<eos> What do I do?
No, this is...<eos> Cannot be real.<eos> This is not real.<eos> This is not real.<eos> It's the fever again.<eos> I remember playing right there.<eos> And I made this crack when I tripped chasing after Aunt Astra.<eos> Yet, even after you fell, you got right back up again.<eos> Nothing can keep you down.<eos> You did this to me!
That's nice.<eos> Allen had a jumbo first and a home equity loan.<eos> Say Veronica sells for 4.4.<eos> With commissions and capital gains, she'll be lucky to clear 200K.<eos> I wonder why he was using his house as an ATM.<eos> Let's keep an eye on probate, see how the estate settles.<eos> The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah. Maybe she does.
- Seriously?<eos> - You're stickin' with that story?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna take a murder wrap over a $200 throwaway?<eos> How stupid do you think I am?<eos> I mean, this shit's ridiculous.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I didn't kill Tony Allen.<eos> Why'd Joey Marks order the hit on him?<eos> He didn't.
The other night was a big game with a big client, and I shouldn't have just blown it off.<eos> You're tired of it, blow it all off.<eos> Quit. It's not that simple.<eos> It's our business.<eos> Look, there's plenty of bullshit in your job, but you don't just walk away.<eos> Yeah, but I put up with the bullshit because what I do is important.<eos> Oh, God, you're such a condescending asshole.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it that way.<eos> Yes, you did.
He always stayed at least a few days.<eos> But not this time.<eos> On his way back, about 6 a.m., he took a detour off highway 15 a couple miles and stopped.<eos> For nearly 90 minutes.<eos> Off road in a Bentley before dawn.<eos> Who does that?<eos> I've made this trip more times than I care to remember, and I can tell you there's absolutely nothing out there.<eos> It's completely desolate.<eos> So why'd your ex-husband give you this?<eos> He didn't.
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> Officer Arceneaux. Deputy Chief Irving.<eos> You need to come back to your house. Now.<eos> We're gonna have that talk.<eos> Yeah, you know I can't do that, right?<eos> I've seen the video from the store.<eos> I saw how upset you were. Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I know you didn't know what was going to happen to my son that night.<eos> No, I didn't.
Take their weapons.<eos> I have in my hand a letter that could save this family.<eos> A missive from Ahmad.<eos> No doubt intended for you.<eos> Well... you certainly have my attention now.<eos> If father reads this to the chieftains, it may be just enough.<eos> Enough to what?<eos> To destroy the Khan.<eos> The Arab saved us again.<eos> He does... or he doesn't.
- I don't, but I think I believe him.<eos> - Okay, so what does this mean?<eos> I'm not certain.<eos> I just thought that you guys should know.<eos> Jesus Christ, Danny was a fucking father?<eos> Listen, it doesn't seem like they had much of a relationship.<eos> Still, John...<eos> Still what, Kevin?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> It doesn't?
- But you just said, "insurance scam".<eos> I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm not a detective.<eos> - You show up at my place, bring me here... - Okay.<eos> Okay, we can stop.<eos> My brother was fucking killed!<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - Kevin...<eos> - Do you?
Yeah, Marco.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> You gonna make him stand out there all day with your pizza?<eos> All right, you're doing the dishes.<eos> Monroe County Sheriff's Department.<eos> We're executing a warranted search of this property.<eos> - Step aside, sir.<eos> - This is fucking harassment.<eos> I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> You do that.
No, no.<eos> Stay away.<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> Stay away. Stay away.<eos> What have you done?<eos> What have I done?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, I did.
Okay.<eos> So, let's focus on what's best for you.<eos> You've said all along that you wanted to understand who they are.<eos> Well, do you think you could ask them to tell you more about what they do?<eos> I guess.<eos> I could try.<eos> Good.<eos> Good. And then we'll figure out what to do next.<eos> When did you get Henry that cologne?<eos> I didn't.
I told him deodorant is fin-- He doesn't need cologne.<eos> He doesn't even shave.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's get dessert someplace else.<eos> Not now.<eos> You sure?<eos> Mm-hmm. If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
Clark?<eos> They know.<eos> They know that he's dead.<eos> Gene is...<eos> Everybody's shocked and...<eos> And running around like crazy.<eos> You're safe.<eos> We're together.<eos> Did he know?<eos> Gene, did he...
Yeah, I'm her DM.<eos> Again, we're gonna need more explanation. Yeah. To know more...<eos> Yeah. - Her Dungeon Master. Yeah.<eos> - Whoa. Tess is new to DD, but, uh, she's really improving.<eos> Mm, he's being kind.<eos> I completely shit the bed last game.<eos> - No. You... It wasn't that bad.<eos> I...<eos> - It was shit. - I have to tell you.<eos> - You don't.
These things always come in pairs.<eos> You see?<eos> Cautes and Cautopates. Day and night.<eos> - You say it was found on a building site? - Yeah.<eos> Well, there's almost certainly something very exciting underneath.<eos> A Mithraic temple.<eos> Perhaps an entire complex. I just hope they have insurance.<eos> Unexpected archaeological discovery insurance.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> Of course we do.
Don't even go there!<eos> What about Henry Williams?<eos> He's our number one suspect.<eos> He was there when one of the teachers fell to their death.<eos> I actually saw him at the station. Do you know he was being paid £20,000 a year?<eos> No, but that makes sense.<eos> He was definitely getting money from somewhere.<eos> - Who was paying it?<eos> SANDS: Why did you go to the station, Henry?<eos> I didn't.
You pushed Mark Henson off a roof...<eos> - ... Laura Jones down the escalators...<eos> - No.<eos> you ran over Steve Mullen in your car.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes,<eos> Henry. Why?<eos> Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!
- ... Laura Jones down the escalators...<eos> - No.<eos> you ran over Steve Mullen in your car.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes,<eos> Henry. Why?<eos> Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...
- No.<eos> you ran over Steve Mullen in your car.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes,<eos> Henry. Why?<eos> Was it something they did in India?<eos> Is that why you wanted to kill them?<eos> I didn't!<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...<eos> I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...
♪ Where you stay out all night long ♪<eos> ♪ I wanna tell you ♪<eos> ♪ You know your daddy's home ♪ ♪ All night long ♪<eos> You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.<eos> Outside.<eos> Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.<eos> Fucking-A right I did.
I still don't get everything that's going on here, but you do not tattoo my neck.<eos> That's creepy.<eos> Duly noted. I guess next time I'll just let you die.<eos> And it's not a tattoo.<eos> It's a rune.<eos> They have enormous power.<eos> Good for Shadowhunters.<eos> Lethal for humans.<eos> But you, you already know all about runes, don't you?<eos> Maybe you don't.
Good!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Now, I want you to go back to your bloomberg and cut bait on your losers -- you know the ones.<eos> The ones you've been defending, hoping they'll come 'round, but, secretly, you know never will.<eos> I want you to just commit that you're in it for the long haul, that you will succeed.<eos> And once you do that, the new ideas, the winners, will present themselves because you are a winner.<eos> You're in the special forces here. You are a Navy seal.<eos> And there's a reason for that.<eos> Did the s.E.A.L.S make a mistake signing you up?<eos> No. They did not.
I lost every one of my friends that day.<eos> And you've managed to make some new ones since.<eos> But like I said, they may be cheering now, but believe me, they are dying to boo.<eos> Moderator: And now from the other side, the man whose job is to ride herd over the bulls and bears,<eos> Chuck rhoades.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Denny dantone's coming in with an offer on the Norton house -- $62 million.<eos> Prepared to close in less than a week, I hear.<eos> How the fuck did he see it?<eos> He didn't.
Found a few that raised a red flag that hadn't gone all the way through the system.<eos> That's some fucking hunch.<eos> Don't hand me that card.<eos> I gave you that card.<eos> Raul.<eos> Okay, you went this far, get right to it.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> You greased some fellows in my union.<eos> If you say I did.<eos> I do.
Your mom... she won't have to work so hard, not at all, unless she wants to.<eos> Time to take your seat at the grown-ups' table.<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> I can't picture it.<eos> Oh, I think you can picture it now.<eos> The Bryan Connerty at the settlement conference... he would've stormed out of here the moment I walked in.<eos> But you stayed, and you listened.<eos> Hmm. And like you said... I stare at the lions at the zoo, too.<eos> Doesn't mean I wanna be one.<eos> Sure, it does.
- Mmm...<eos> - His name is Emery.<eos> Well, the names change, you're just using the tools at your disposal.<eos> How's Christine?<eos> Nice deflection tactic.<eos> As your intern?<eos> That's not what you were asking.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
We can't fight that without Zeke.<eos> Listen up!<eos> We say ladies first.<eos> Fuck Zeke. We don't need him.<eos> This is a DJ battle, right?<eos> Don't forget, whichever crew gets the B-boys to rock is the crew that comes out on top.<eos> Hello, South Bronx!<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -We got no hot water.<eos> How you doing?
Nick! Nick, are you all right?<eos> What is happening? What's happening?<eos> I don't know. Call a fucking ambulance.<eos> - I think he's having a heart attack.<eos> - I'll call an ambulance.<eos> - Nick. Maybe you should just let him sleep this off.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - We met at dinner.<eos> Hello. Hi, there's been an accident.<eos> - Oh, God, I don't...
You don't return my calls.<eos> You pay me hourly to save money.<eos> That's called being practical. I'm a businessman, dickhead.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm the cheapest accountant in town.<eos> I'm working out of my fucking car, for Christ's sake.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - Hey!<eos> You okay, Robert?<eos> Some free advice... stop spending money like you actually have money.<eos> 'Cause you don't.
That doesn't sound good.<eos> They also call it "40-year-old shoulder."<eos> "40-year-old shoulder"?<eos> Happens to some people around the age of 40.<eos> Ligaments tighten up for no reason.<eos> It works itself out in about a week or so.<eos> Just won't be able to raise your arm above a "heil."<eos> That's... inconvenient.<eos> They have no idea what causes it, or...<eos> Sure they do: Age.
How much would you take?<eos> - I don't think you could afford it.<eos> - Oh, try me.<eos> Okay, look. The truth is, these agent and author boycotts, they've been hitting me pretty hard.<eos> I actually haven't acquired anything in months.<eos> This would be a huge get for me.<eos> Now, how much would you take to get it off your hands?<eos> (sighs) I don't know, um... maybe...<eos> - double our advance?<eos> - Done.
Meet. You.<eos> No, that's too robot.<eos> Just say it normal. Just say it normal.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Nice to meet you!<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Junior.<eos> Hunter.<eos> You know why I built my office entirely out of glass even though birds can't see glass?<eos> I do not.
No gossip allowed!<eos> I've called you both in because I hear you've been having problems.<eos> - And it's important we have...<eos> - She's the one who started it!<eos> - How dare you!<eos> - How dare you!<eos> - How dare both of you!<eos> You're fired!<eos> - You can't fire me!<eos> - I just did!
She's reaching for you.<eos> Maybe she just wants you.<eos> No. That doesn't make sense.<eos> Technically, she should be perfectly happy.<eos> What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!<eos> What do I do with her?
I am clearing my schedule and moving in with my sister.<eos> I'm perfectly capable...<eos> You are entirely too stubborn to ask anyone for help.<eos> You do everything for everyone else.<eos> But you need me right now.<eos> And you need me.<eos> So I'm moving in, too!<eos> Kimmy, you do not need to do this.<eos> Yes, I agree with D.J. You do not need to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
If-- if you would like us to figure out what went wrong here, we need to be allowed to access it.<eos> No more second chances.<eos> QA will handle events like this from now on.<eos> Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?<eos> We've all got plenty of work on our plates.<eos> If you guys want to take this one, fine.<eos> Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> You know, I always figured you gave me this job because I speak my mind.<eos> - I did.
We're not exactly in a culture where we can just let loose.<eos> I would have thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.<eos> My artistic freedom is constrained, what, with QA breathing down my neck and behavior programming the damn things to go off script.<eos> The robots can go off script?<eos> Just little gestures.<eos> You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
Can you leave me alone?<eos> I think you're gonna want to hear this, unless, of course, you don't want to go solo.<eos> Seth is calling.<eos> You gonna pick it up?<eos> No.<eos> No? You have 11 missed calls.<eos> You have to fuckin' talk to him.<eos> Do I, Clyde?<eos> Yes, you do, Jeannie.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay, Joni, you wanna talk?<eos> - Because I've been tryin' to figure out the math, you know?<eos> I was gone one year and there's what, 600,000 people in Memphis and half of that's men.<eos> So just how, logistically, - did you manage to fuck 300,000 men... - You are a child.<eos> - I did have an affair, Mac, with one person, with Cliff.<eos> We had sex.<eos> Feel better hearing me say it?<eos> That I fucked another man while you were gone? Yeah, well, now at least we can both acknowledge you're a whore.<eos> - You didn't sleep with any Vietnamese prostitutes...<eos> - No, no, no, I didn't!
For the chosen victim it is like being called a wife beater or a pedophile.<eos> It is enough for the label to be attached for the attachee to be designated a pariah, an outcast from normal society.<eos> It is a verbal Yellow Star.<eos> So, what did you think of him?<eos> I thought he was oddly impressive.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, did you enjoy it? Look, there he is.<eos> Look, still at it.<eos> It was confusing. It was like he already knew all of our questions.<eos> Well, yes, of course he does.
I'd already forgotten about it.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> But why would you say... that he tried to turn me against you?<eos> Just a thought.<eos> I know Antoine.<eos> You do?<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...<eos> Almost never, actually.<eos> And when he does... No.
You kept pushing me!<eos> Always following me around, never leaving me alone.<eos> I warned you you would get hurt.<eos> I told you to stop.<eos> Because we're connected... bonded.<eos> And that's why I killed Cray... for you.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That... That's on you, not me.<eos> I never asked for that.<eos> Of course you did.
What are you saying?<eos> You wanna keep her here till she gives up what she knows?<eos> I'm not holding her prisoner to find out information.<eos> This poor girl is lost in the shadows, away from God's love.<eos> If we show her the light...<eos> So what's the plan? Are you praying for her to live or die?<eos> I pray for her soul.<eos> This is wrong.<eos> This is a mistake. I will not have blood on my hands.<eos> You already do.
We might could find a nigger family to sell to.<eos> But even then, you'd be getting 70, 75% of your purchase price.<eos> I think there's already some moving in across the way.<eos> Probably a good idea that y'all are cutting your losses.<eos> We're not trying to cut our losses, Lloyd.<eos> Then why you want out? Y'all looking to upgrade?<eos> Having kids?<eos> No, not any time soon.<eos> - Nothing like that. - Is that why he came to see me and asked me for money?<eos> He did?
We already seen a white man drag his friend off a bus and beat him damn near dead this week.<eos> Same white man y'all let walk free about an hour ago.<eos> A curfew's a curfew.<eos> Yeah, and I'm sure you're on your way to Germantown now to tell those folks to get inside, ain't you?<eos> You're both breaking the law, boy.<eos> "Boy" me one more time.<eos> Take your son and get back inside.<eos> You know we didn't do anything.<eos> What's that?<eos> We didn't do anything.
No, we're on a job.<eos> Well, I'm thirsty.<eos> Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> You did two tours in 'Nam, right?<eos> How many people did you kill over there?<eos> When I first started working for the Broker, I'd keep track.<eos> Not "write shit down" keep track. Nothing stupid like that, but just... remember their names.<eos> Like they were lovers or something, I don't even know what.<eos> Wasn't even something I was consciously trying to do.<eos> I just did.
Well, I'm sorry I cared about your brother.<eos> - You don't care. - I do care!<eos> - Not really. - No, I do care!<eos> You cared about him so much, you didn't call him for 15 years?<eos> Or bother to come to his funeral?<eos> If you did care, you would realize that constantly reminding me that he's gone forever isn't something I wanna think about any more than I already do, which is pretty much all the goddamn time!<eos> You're living in his fucking house.<eos> Yeah, and maybe I shouldn't be, but if I don't, then there's nothing left of him.<eos> - There's nothing. - Sandy, that doesn't even make sense.<eos> Yeah, it probably doesn't.
Sir, it's pretty hairy in there at the moment.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Those kids can't stay here.<eos> Just concentrate on the doctor stuff.<eos> Don't you patronize me.<eos> I just put my clinic on the line for you.<eos> It's under control.<eos> - They murdered a man.<eos> - They didn't.
I don't care about collateral damage.<eos> I can work with that.<eos> But three Hairy boys loose in the streets tearing people's hearts out...<eos> They didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> You killed Dickson?<eos> No, I just made the best of a bad situation.<eos> That symbol on the wall, that was you?<eos> Your approval rating went up 10 percentage points after your press release, after that image went viral.<eos> Now, did I do the wrong thing?
_<eos> It doesn't leave much to the imagination.<eos> This will destroy Matthews.<eos> - And the CA. - Not the CA.<eos> It's a private company.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, a long time ago now. The government outsourced itself to Jarrod Slade.<eos> - No one said boo. - Slade?<eos> He owns it.<eos> Well, at least one of his shell companies does.
Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Go back.<eos> Go back.<eos> Go.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die.<eos> I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
It was in the garbage, when I was looking for shutters.<eos> There's nothing wrong with it.<eos> Eat.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Astronauts share.<eos> They may need each other's forces when they come up there.<eos> - How do you know they get up there?<eos> - They do.
I can call the store.<eos> This is too stressful!<eos> I didn't send the roses!<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> Because I'm so glad we're getting along so good.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight.<eos> And if you're lucky, we'll talk about it in the morning, too.<eos> OK, if you didn't send the roses, then why did you say you got me flowers?<eos> Because I did.
Guys, can we talk?<eos> Now what do you want, a kidney?<eos> I realized something during the dance.<eos> Life is short.<eos> We must savor every moment.<eos> I will no longer boss you around.<eos> Really? Yes.<eos> Be at peace, my children.<eos> And we don't have to pay you back?<eos> Of course you do.
Who said anything about strippers?<eos> I did and I say they're fine.<eos> Get some ones, some fives, put a few girls through college, everybody wins.<eos> Just stay away from the seedy dives, yeah.<eos> The seedy dives?<eos> You know, the ones where the girls don't really want to be there.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Eva, no, I'm not into that kind of stuff.<eos> - You know me.<eos> - I do.
- You do? Okay. - She wants to go.<eos> Come on. Okay, come on.<eos> Let's go, please.<eos> - Which way?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - I thought you said you counted the doors.<eos> - It wasn't like this before.<eos> There's someone back here, Jonah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> She does.
It was our friend, Jonah.<eos> Yeah, it was... It was his bachelor party.<eos> Yeah. And the man...<eos> And the man there, he brought us here.<eos> We followed him...<eos> You bought it all with good memories, so your friend Jonah could spend some time with one of my star attractions.<eos> That's great.<eos> So why did he let her go?<eos> I don't know. I don't know, okay?<eos> I don't.
Tick tock, Jonah.<eos> Your old friend's inside and I don't wanna be here when the new one shows up.<eos> My, my!<eos> Hell is empty and the devils are all here.<eos> You look horrible.<eos> Where's Rand?<eos> No hello, no nothing.<eos> Come on. I'll take you to him.<eos> So she didn't catch you?<eos> She did.
I just want to go home. Do you?<eos> She's a killer, Jonah.<eos> You know that.<eos> Now put her back where she belongs.<eos> She belongs to me. Do it. Now.<eos> How about we go home?<eos> Both of us. To our own homes.<eos> And we just leave it at that.<eos> You're wasting time.<eos> Do it.
We've discussed this before.<eos> Not everyone can be as neutral as Sweden.<eos> I just thought you were free and independent.<eos> -Instead of acting for the Americans.<eos> -Two million German soldiers travelled through neutral Sweden. Was that noble?<eos> That's one of your old arguments.<eos> It must be a good one then, since it's used repeatedly.<eos> Will you come to the medal ceremony tomorrow?<eos> -Erling, you don't want me there.<eos> -I do.
-Alright.<eos> You? -Yeah.<eos> -She's still here, right?<eos> -Yes.<eos> She's resting.<eos> -They'll be here soon.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Intelligence wanted me to guard her for a few days.<eos> But why didn't you tell me Sharif is dead?<eos> -I didn't?
He struck February 13th through '90 and '94.<eos> He always targeted couples.<eos> And always put a groom for a wedding cake topper inside the male victim's mouth.<eos> And what about the female victims?<eos> All the women were found dead by midnight on Valentine's Day.<eos> I was in college.<eos> Trish Kellogg and I spent every Valentine's Day just hiding out, eating milk duds.<eos> I'm not sure that had anything to do with a serial killer.<eos> Didn't the police catch this lunatic?<eos> They did.
She lent me that tooth.<eos> And as for your other unfounded accusation, I have an alibi for last night.<eos> I was with a writer, getting advice on self-publishing.<eos> Self-publishing what?<eos> I am writing the completely true story of the St. Valentine murders.<eos> And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police...<eos> Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
Except the blood evidence isn't.<eos> In the old crime scenes the blood was pooled.<eos> Too much spatter here.<eos> St. Valentine was surgical.<eos> New killer is no expert with the knife.<eos> There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
Totally sappy.<eos> Got something.<eos> What you got me?<eos> Back in 1994, the hotline got an anonymous tip on a guy living in a house at 115 Conyer Street.<eos> So did they follow it up?<eos> No, because two hours later they caught Glen Baker.<eos> And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought. What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
They're there forever.<eos> Do you know -- you know -- unh-unh, no, no.<eos> Do you know... How hard it was to get you into that school?<eos> I mean, do you -- do you understand how much it takes out of this house? !<eos> And you get kicked out for doing something stupid?<eos> ! I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No. You do!
The threat is over.<eos> Now... wherever this container took Abbie, return her.<eos> I'm through being ordered around. No, no.<eos> We retrieved this Box for you.<eos> We gave you everything you asked.<eos> And now you can be the first to worship me.<eos> The Hidden One is dead.<eos> I have his power now.<eos> I won't ask much of my followers, only that they serve me, obey me, and as is fitting, fear me.<eos> What did you do to my sister?
Get the fuck out of here.<eos> I shit my pants for nothing?<eos> I didn't do this for my amusement.<eos> What happened to Steven birch...<eos> Who I am sure will be cleared of any wrongdoing...<eos> It could happen to us.<eos> So we need to be prepared.<eos> To that end, say "hello" to that end, say "hello" to our new and improved compliance department.<eos> These assholes work here now?<eos> That, they do.
Okay, then, after me. Ready?<eos> Well, they'll be back.<eos> Next time, with an army. We're low on ammo.<eos> Best get going.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What I came for. What?<eos> These are game consoles.<eos> Right, but just the last gen.<eos> We don't have time for games.<eos> No, we don't.
You asked me to run a check on a candidate a few months back.<eos> Oil for Development.<eos> Sharif Zamani's murder.<eos> Rolf Inherad was involved.<eos> We're out in the cold.<eos> The radio wants you on the six o'clock news, and some breakfast show wants to talk to you, along with the committee chair.<eos> -Why?<eos> -Same old nonsense.<eos> Two women, two different generations and viewpoints... All the crap we're supposed to be so proud of here in Norway.<eos> Why don't you do it, then?
Sounds like she has something fun in store for all of us today.<eos> The Machine made you a package delivery driver?<eos> Sadly, all of my identities can't be bears or brides.<eos> I gotta go. Don't want to be late for my first day of training.<eos> Yes, I think it's wise if perhaps we all got to work.<eos> So Anderson Rake Consulting employs over 20,000 in more than 90 countries and count among their clients the Department of Defense.<eos> I gathered as much when I saw my ID.<eos> It came with a security clearance.<eos> How'd you manage that on short notice?<eos> I didn't.
Who would've thought my latest cover didn't like paying rent?<eos> - Artist?<eos> - Meth head.<eos> I need a place to crash for a few nights.<eos> I'll make lasagna.<eos> You're welcome to stay here.<eos> You can feed Bear while I attend a wedding.<eos> Since when did you start dressing like a middle school science teacher?<eos> I don't.<eos> But Uncle Ralph does.
An officer told me that I had to leave the interrogation room.<eos> Did you find my wife?<eos> He's still got her.<eos> That means he's still got you under his thumb.<eos> What's he making you do?<eos> They were slipped under the door.<eos> - By whom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I got a text with instructions.<eos> To do what?
How 'bout you give me your full name?<eos> Harold Osprey.<eos> Good choice, Harry.<eos> They're common around here and so funny-looking.<eos> Stay right here.<eos> Officer Reed there is a good man, just not a very smart cop.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> I didn't teach you how to love.<eos> Of course you did.
What?<eos> I don't want to kill anyone.<eos> You got this all wrong.<eos> My friend caught you running out of the party.<eos> - Seem suspicious?<eos> - A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
I don't feel guilty or scared.<eos> I don't make friends, so I have nothing to lose, but you, you're just a normal guy with a normal life.<eos> - That's what I've been saying.<eos> - Good.<eos> That just means that if you don't tell me what I want to know, you have people I could go after.<eos> Are you starting to worry about them, Charlie?<eos> You should.<eos> You probably won't like what I do to them.<eos> If I could feel sympathy for you, Charlie, I would.<eos> But I don't.
There's someone I think you're gonna want to talk to.<eos> So your shield checks out.<eos> Doesn't explain why you're running an off-the-books operation outside of your jurisdiction.<eos> Maybe your chief can explain.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Agent Wickham, Homeland Security.<eos> Detective Fusco here's been working with us to infiltrate this domestic terrorist ring.<eos> Homeland Security running a joint operation with NYPD?<eos> - How do you explain that one?<eos> - I don't.
- Gloria, you got to calm down.<eos> - Does it mean 200 people?<eos> - Gloria... - What is "not many" mean?<eos> - I gotta tell someone. I gotta tell somebody.<eos> - Hey, you gotta calm down.<eos> - I gotta turn myself and I gotta... - What?<eos> No, hold on.<eos> I gotta tell how it could happen.<eos> - Yeah, but you don't know what happen.<eos> - Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
What are they called?<eos> 'Let the birds be.<eos> You know that I love you?<eos> -Yes. And I you.<eos> -I am terribly sorry.<eos> -Because we never talked about it.<eos> -About what? I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
Great.<eos> Can you take her to the lake?<eos> You ok?<eos> I wanna head back today.<eos> I'm not feeling so good.<eos> Tell me what's up.<eos> I think this place is making me worse.<eos> We'll go home after lunch.<eos> Who wants to skip some stones?<eos> I do!
Looking for you.<eos> But I'm right here.<eos> Were you singing?<eos> The fairy song.<eos> Where'd you hear it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
It's so sad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Usually after work, he goes to a small dog park in Brooklyn, even though he doesn't own a dog.<eos> Just sits there for hours.<eos> Does he write letters to the dogs?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, that would be like the home run, right?<eos> I mean, that's what we need.<eos> - Does he?
I killed her.<eos> - She is lying. - What? I humbly asked them whether they could protest for a while.<eos> They rudely said "no"!<eos> - I won't let anything happen to you.<eos> Trust me. I killed her, mother.<eos> I killed her. As you can see Srikant who was excruciated by the police..<eos> "Has lost his mental balance completely.<eos> You can see that he is vew scared.<eos> I killed her.<eos> - You didn't do anything.
Kaka Sahib is making an accusation on me.<eos> Relax Kriplani. - I did all this for you. Relax.<eos> He is just reassuring.<eos> And I trust you.<eos> And I appreciate your gesture. - Thank you.<eos> Vew shortly, you will receive a call from my accounts department.<eos> No.<eos> Why are you taking it the wrong way?<eos> Look, you are getting it all wrong.<eos> I didn't do all this for the money.
Scott, maybe we should let Rachel sleep.<eos> No, she's... She gonna be out cold for at least another day.<eos> I'll bet you he's making the gas stronger.<eos> Maybe she's got a movement inside her.<eos> Let's see, you got a bird, he's got a sea creature.<eos> I wonder what's next.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> 'Cause of some movements that you fucking hallucinated?<eos> How did you explain your NDE to people in Pittsburgh?<eos> I didn't.
Old people are annoying.<eos> Are they?<eos> I know you think I'm too conservative and old-fashioned, but I did marry a black woman.<eos> That's got to mean something.<eos> Dad, I don't see race.<eos> I see a bossy woman who you married who's always in my house.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You know, I don't agree with how you raised these girls, but I see how much they like you.<eos> That must feel kind of good.<eos> It does.
Tomorrow, I'm all yours.<eos> And the day after that.<eos> - And the day after that.<eos> - Okay. And the day after that.<eos> She gone?<eos> Uh, yes, Patrick.<eos> She... She's gone.<eos> The poor kid.<eos> She really didn't have that coming, you know?<eos> No, she didn't.
Speak plainly.<eos> If Beowulf wishes to hunt the Wyrm for the gland that can save Mara, let him. I will help him.<eos> Why?<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> If she lives she'll be mine.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Save Mara kill Beowulf, and we have a deal.<eos> Over there.<eos> - What do I do with this?
You're like your father. No sacrifice is too great for success in business!<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - He's completely smitten. - I don't get it. - He's completely smitten.<eos> It's written all over his face.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - He looks hot to trot to me!<eos> He reminds me of Mrs Lemaire's teeny dog.<eos> He wanted to mount Mrs Françu's bitch.<eos> Remember, Philippe?<eos> Of course you do.
It just... I don't know. You don't know what it's like.<eos> I, um...<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street. Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Are you sure he said Panther AR-15s?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Mr. Perales.<eos> Drew.<eos> Perales, please step down.<eos> Drew, what's wrong?<eos> Everything's wrong.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Walk.<eos> Simon, I'm not moving.<eos> You think just because I can't kill a deer that I can't kill you?<eos> No.<eos> I think you can.<eos> But you won't because if you wanted to kill me, you would have pulled that trigger already.<eos> Just like you would have done to yourself.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Actually, I do.
Word is, Bobby Axelrod is up to a 4.9% stake in YumTime.<eos> Thanks for the heads up, Purk.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Fuck! Sh...<eos> Cheryl, get in here!<eos> And you know what ATM stands for, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't wanna be the kind of person that gets off on that.<eos> I really don't.
Ass-to-mouth, by the way.<eos> Just so that we are speaking the same language.<eos> Oh, we are.<eos> Sometimes on the drive home, I'll roll it over in my mind.<eos> You know, what is it about a woman taking it into her mouth after a little raw-dogging that just seems so right? That just seems so right?<eos> And it's this... That I'm accepted as I am.<eos> Completely.<eos> For my good qualities, sure, but also for all... of my filth.<eos> And I appreciate a woman who is that giving.<eos> I truly do.
Hmm, you think? Hmm, you think?<eos> Is it a defamation case?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me.<eos> How much is true?<eos> He made some shrewd trades around 9/11.<eos> You know, he did what he had to do.<eos> My husband plays hardball.<eos> Nobody makes billions of dollars pitching underhand.<eos> But his work situation beforehand, what he did after, incendiary.
I'm just gathering up my things.<eos> You know, the most fun I ever had was breaking down all the walls you built around yourself.<eos> And now I get to do it all over again.<eos> Good night.<eos> So much is different.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I noticed... everybody's real cozy with Deacon now.<eos> I'm really not sure how all this is gonna work now that you're here, and not back in 2016.<eos> We have a mission to finish.<eos> We do.
I'm sorry, Chip.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> Martha told me that you found out about our little sex romp in the van.<eos> - Can I take your order?<eos> - And you know, you're my brother, and I wanted to come to you and let you know that I love Martha, okay?<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - I do.<eos> I love her. I do.<eos> She makes me feel alive.<eos> - No, she doesn't.

I mean, we used to go at each other hard all the time out of respect.<eos> That's the kind of friendship it was.<eos> What kind of prick would he be if he took it easy now?<eos> Hey, I'm just pointing out that while he's telling us he doesn't shoot the moon anymore, he just shot the fucking moon on us.<eos> Unless you can take this, which you can't.<eos> No. Sh...<eos> Freddy, you're the one who fucked that one up.<eos> I mean, you saw what he was up to.<eos> I mean, I caught on a little bit later, but I didn't have the cards to do anything about it.<eos> But you did.
- No! No. I'm at the whim of... of some dark force that we have absolutely no understanding of.<eos> I could vanish forever at any moment, and we'd have no idea when or what would happen next...<eos> What do we know?<eos> Your work at Isodyne was in containment research. You built a housing unit for zero matter.<eos> Perhaps you can do something similar for yourself.<eos> - That won't work.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I have no mass.<eos> I have no material form to contain.<eos> But if you did?
- Oh, good Lord.<eos> - What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I walked in and he was face down on the kitchen table.<eos> And you didn't say anything that could cause his face to land on the kitchen table?<eos> No. I came home to tell him, but I never had a chance.<eos> Grace?<eos> Is that you, sweetheart?<eos> -You didn't have to come.<eos> -Of course I did.
Of course I did.<eos> Why wouldn't I come?<eos> A heartless monster with no moral compass?<eos> Forgive me. I...<eos> It's Robert Hanson.<eos> Not Robert Handsome.<eos> That's not a name for a person.<eos> He had a heart attack, if you can search by that.<eos> OK. I-- Now you just typed in "Bobert."<eos> You did. That's-
- Dude, 4k.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Good choice.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - So you're still here.<eos> - Yep.<eos> I'm in town until harvest.<eos> Oh, you're a farmer.<eos> - What do you farm, dirt?<eos> - No, no. We do almonds, apricots, beans, cabbage, cantaloupe, carrots, citrus, cotton, and plant seed...
What was that, morse code?<eos> I was trying to let you know something.<eos> Can I just go urinate, please? Easter.<eos> Please. Give me a little break.<eos> Ohh.<eos> Actually, can I...<eos> I really need to go to the bathroom, okay?<eos> He doesn't need to go to the bathroom.<eos> - I do need to go to the...<eos> - He doesn't.
Hey, Dill, did you take someone named Muzzy to a black-tie gala last week?<eos> I'm sorry, but... but did you?<eos> I took a friend to a work event last week, yes.<eos> There are many friends, there are many work events.<eos> Is there a reason why you're asking?<eos> No, I just...<eos> - no, somebody just said that.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> They also said you keep a guy named Shane downstairs for sometimes sex.<eos> Of course they did.
Stop.<eos> Don't you do that thing where you convince yourself that you don't deserve happiness, 'cause you do.<eos> And I do, too.<eos> And we are gonna become a family tomorrow, damn it, and nothing's gonna stop us.<eos> And it looks like wedding bells are ringing today for Rayna Jaymes.<eos> She and her longtime love, Deacon Claybourne, have made no public announcement, but pair are rumored to be holding the event at a property once owned by the bride's mother.<eos> And the pressure may be taking its toll on the couple, after a scuffle with the paparazzi last night outside a restaurant in Nashville.<eos> Dad!<eos> I guess I just poured gasoline on all this.<eos> No, honey, you didn't.
I've had some writer's block.<eos> I sent you the one a few weeks ago, but, uh, it's like I said, I think I'd be better with co-writes.<eos> That's gonna be tough.<eos> Wade Cole's put the word out that you're difficult.<eos> No!<eos> He's saying I was the problem?<eos> I'd love to tell the folks it's not true, but I can't do that without knowing why you bailed on him.<eos> It just didn't work out, is all.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't working for us.<eos> How we doing in here?
That ain't funny.<eos> None of this is funny.<eos> Detective Hantz.<eos> If it's any consolation, your attacker could be in big trouble.<eos> Well, he doesn't seem too worried about it.<eos> We'll see you tomorrow, boys.<eos> Probably not his first time in handcuffs.<eos> No, but it's his first time facing a felony hate crime.<eos> I understand he shouted gay slurs at you?<eos> - Damn right he did.
He's got custody.<eos> Guess I should just be lucky that he's letting me come visit.<eos> Which is definitely progress.<eos> You're right.<eos> After everything I put that man through, I guess I should just be grateful that he and I are in an okay place.<eos> What if Riff's just sick or hung over or something?<eos> I doubt Luke would consider canceling for a hangover.<eos> But he's looking for a replacement, right?<eos> - I'm sure he's gonna find someone.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
Why'd you have to blow up on her like that last night?<eos> You have no idea what it was like in there, Rayna!<eos> All right?<eos> ! What was I supposed to say?<eos> ! "Excuse me, young man. When you're done groping my daughter's leg, can I have a little word with you over here?"<eos> - What was I supposed to do?<eos> ! - I don't know.<eos> But I do know what it is to be a 16-year-old girl and have a fight with your father and leave the house forever.<eos> And I don't want that for Maddie.<eos> I don't, either.
I don't, either.<eos> I'm just scared to death, and I don't... know our next move.<eos> I thought of one place we haven't looked yet.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Going off the deep end like that seems so unlike him.<eos> Does it?<eos> Come on.<eos> He was always like this on the road... the parties, the groupies.<eos> You must remember.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why would he be blackmailing you?<eos> Jeff was threatening to... expose some details about my personal life.<eos> - There was a woman that I was was involved with.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I never wanted you to know, but you have to understand that your mother has always had your best interests at heart.<eos> So, all my parents are liars, then.<eos> Look correct me if I'm wrong here, but didn't you originally<eos> - drop Will from your label?<eos> - Yeah, I-I did.
Even if I could...<eos> I just... I just don't really want to.<eos> - I love singing it with Maddie.<eos> - I know.<eos> Is she ever gonna play with me ever again or...<eos> - even talk to us?<eos> - Yeah, absolutely, honey.<eos> Look, we're just... your mom and I are doing everything we can to get her home right now, all right?<eos> - I don't get why she's doing this.<eos> - I don't, either.
Yeah.<eos> Everything sounds perfect for you.<eos> I'm sorry. I-I didn't...<eos> Mean it like that.<eos> I'm just frustrated.<eos> Avery has no time for me now that juliette's back in town, So I feel like my album's at a standstill.<eos> Are they, like, hanging out again or something?<eos> They're hardly talking, actually.<eos> Not everybody has a great relationship with their ex.<eos> Well, scarlett and gunnar do.
Wow. I'd be pretty mad about that.<eos> I'm more jealous than anything.<eos> I mean, not the fact that he joined the army, But just that he can make his own choices in life.<eos> Look, feeling trapped sucks.<eos> But maybe it'll make good fodder for a song.<eos> What is the point of writing any If no one will ever hear them outside of this room?<eos> Look, I thought the same way when I was your age.<eos> I wanted to get in front of people so badly That I actually snuck out and played cafés.<eos> Wait.<eos> What if I do that, too?
She's 16 years old, cash!<eos> She's a child!<eos> She's my child, all right?<eos> ! You got no right to take her anywhere, Least of all some bar where she's up onstage so she can --<eos> What?<eos> What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, how do you think it's going?<eos> Look, I know this judge.<eos> She's got kids of her own.<eos> Really think you're winning her over.<eos> Honestly, if we don't turn the dial up, she won't rule in our favor.<eos> We need to use our alternate strategy.<eos> Look, I know that you don't want to do that.<eos> - I don't.
I think I was trying to build a wall to protect myself, to protect my girls from... my feelings for him.<eos> And yet it seems you've built a door in that wall so you could let him in or shut him out as you needed.<eos> I don't know that I'd put it that way.<eos> Well, you had effectively disentangled yourself from a romantic relationship, then you hired him as your bandleader.<eos> Have you ever heard him play guitar?<eos> And the songs that we wrote together...<eos> Look, in spite of all the hell, that part was heaven.<eos> There's just something that happens.<eos> There's a magic that happens.<eos> Still does.
Deacon... unreliable, sometimes volatile.<eos> Are you trying to say I've chosen this?<eos> I'm not talking about choices... just patterns.<eos> And as a result, you've had to, as you said, build a wall.<eos> And, Deacon, to some degree, you have always seen Rayna as an unattainable ideal.<eos> So I would posit that the work now would be for you, Deacon, to find a way to be relieved of that crippling burden of guilt and for you, Rayna, to find a way to take a step towards forgiveness.<eos> You both have a deep mythology about this bond... its inevitability, the sense of yourselves as artists all tied up within it.<eos> But there's a dark side to it.<eos> I'm not questioning whether you both love each other or not.<eos> You clearly do.
I want Maddie back.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Me too.<eos> So, Mr. Big Shot.<eos> How was that?<eos> I-I still can't believe it was real.<eos> Well, believe this.<eos> Elton said that you were an absolute natural out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> He did not.
That's what I want.<eos> Me too.<eos> So, Mr. Big Shot.<eos> How was that?<eos> I-I still can't believe it was real.<eos> Well, believe this.<eos> Elton said that you were an absolute natural out there.<eos> Come on.<eos> He did not.<eos> Yes, he did!
Unbelievable! I'm a fucking nerd!<eos> You're not a fucking nerd!<eos> You can't judge a cover of a book by its look!<eos> That's what I'm saying. You're not a fucking nerd!<eos> Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Fucking Jesus Christ!<eos> What the heck's going on here?<eos> This is such a great little place that you have here!<eos> (Cough, straining) Thanks for letting us stay, fuckface.<eos> I didn't!
(Laughing) Okay, so what are you fucking saying?<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> I thought you said this guy was the best.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he is. That's why he's so damn expensive.<eos> Well, I want to meet this guy, man.<eos> Enough of this fucking middle man shit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure. No problem.<eos> I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
Queen Nia of Azgeda, who do you choose to be your champion?<eos> My son Roan, Prince of Azgeda.<eos> Heda, who will fight for you?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Best we can tell, Mount Weather was destroyed by an internal self-destruct mechanism.<eos> It worked as designed.<eos> 49 of our citizens were lost.<eos> So when do we strike back?<eos> We don't.
Everybody, back to your quarters.<eos> - It's over.<eos> - Nothing is over.<eos> We are surrounded by warriors who want us dead.<eos> - That's enough. - No.<eos> It isn't, not even close.<eos> Why don't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday?<eos> Come on, Kane.<eos> I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know.<eos> We do.
Ice Nation will bow before your Commander.<eos> The Commander should bow before Ice Nation.<eos> We know not to make treaties with our enemies.<eos> The Commander bows before no one.<eos> Stand down, Titus.<eos> She even prefers the enemy's language.<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Oh, come on.<eos> That's like setting the launch codes all zeros.<eos> And yet it's better than anything we've come up with.<eos> I'll check the president's office.<eos> We'll keep working the tech angle.<eos> Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
At least Pike understands that.<eos> Pike is the problem.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> This is who I've always been, and I let you and Octavia and Kane convince me that we could trust these people when they have shown over and over who they are, and I won't let anyone else die for that mistake.<eos> Bellamy...<eos> I need you, and we don't have much time.<eos> You need me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Don't, all right?<eos> Everyone thinks they have an idea on how to help me feel better...<eos> Stay in camp, only do jobs where I can sit down, ask every time I need something on a high shelf... but you know what?<eos> I'm not that person.<eos> People think I can just change and my pain will go away, but I can't.<eos> I can't do that, and I can't do this.<eos> What have you got to lose?<eos> Pike should be in his quarters.<eos> Bellamy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Bet you didn't think we'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark, huh?<eos> This isn't a game, Nate.<eos> If we don't find out what Pike's up to, more people will die.<eos> Then let's not get caught.<eos> Chancellor Pike, good to see you.<eos> Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
Your kill order must be fully enforced.<eos> If you care for Clarke, you will send her home.<eos> It is the only way that she will be safe.<eos> Don't make her pay the price for your mistakes as Costia did.<eos> My mistakes?<eos> Azgeda cut off Costia's head and delivered it to my bed, and still I let them into my alliance.<eos> I'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty.<eos> I'm sorry, Lexa.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> Yes, you did...
I got it on my Ascension Day, a circle for every Natblida that died<eos> 7 circles.<eos> I thought you said there were 9 novitiates at your conclave.<eos> There were.<eos> What happened to number 8?<eos> Can we talk about something else?<eos> We don't have to talk at all.<eos> Murphy?<eos> He's alive.<eos> What did you do to my friend?
I can't break the spell.<eos> Who did it then?<eos> I want the warlock's name.<eos> See, Jocelyn may be unreachable, but her daughter is still out there.<eos> You must want to help the girl, right?<eos> Maybe a little medicine... will trigger your memory, hmm?<eos> No.<eos> You have to understand, the Silent Brothers aren't like us.<eos> They lack your charm and superior people skills?<eos> Yeah, most people do.
It's the Shadowhunter creed.<eos> "Looking better in black than the widows of our enemies."<eos> My Latin's pretty rusty, but I'm almost positive that's not what that says.<eos> "For Shadowhunters, the descent into hell is easy."<eos> That should be a postcard.<eos> It's this way.<eos> I'm sorry... about what I said before about your mom. I didn't know.<eos> It's cute.<eos> You assume I have feelings.<eos> I don't.
I-I like to travel, see new places and... meet new people.<eos> But, I mean, you choose a job before you really know if you'll like it, right?<eos> I mean, when you're young, you don't... know anything... who you are, what you wanna do, be.<eos> You pick something because it fits what you like, what... what you need.<eos> But life changes things, you change, or... or something.<eos> And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You...<eos> You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
Well, do we need to have it on?<eos> It makes a lot of sense, some of the stuff they're saying.<eos> Bubbles: Yeah, 'cause your dad brainwashed you.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's, like, almost 5:30, it's a minute after 5:30.<eos> There he is.<eos> Ricky: Man, he looks fucked.<eos> Bubbles: Look at his hair.<eos> How did he grow it back?<eos> He didn't, Ricky.
There's no better feeling doing a Bamp; E, reaping' off some dumb-dumb idiot.<eos> Hit off that?<eos> No?<eos> Anyway, I'm lucky Lucy's stayed with me this long.<eos> And I can't risk losing my family again.<eos> Right now I'm doing nothing wrong.<eos> Just waiting for my pizzas to cook.<eos> Nothing illegal about that.<eos> And it's not a lie if you believe it's not happening.<eos> And I do.
Doesn't take much.<eos> Come on.<eos> Spontaneous weddings are pretty fucking romantic.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This weekend?<eos> Might as well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't...
Teeth!<eos> This is cocked beyond fuck, boys.<eos> I might have just lost my family over Sam's shit-covered cave teeth?<eos> Thanks, Julian.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> (Clang) Fuck!<eos> How's it going, Randy?<eos> Got a tip about a Bamp; E that led us here.<eos> You know anything about that, cutie pie?<eos> No, I don't.
- No!<eos> - I'm sorry!<eos> - Don't!<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> - Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> I--I know where the money is!<eos> - Nice try.<eos> - No, I do.
We're higher than a giraffe's pussy.<eos> It's dangerous up here.<eos> Dangerous, like when you fuck with the Soldados, like when you shoot one of them.<eos> I'm gonna shoot your mama in the face with my dick!<eos> - What was that? - I'm gonna...<eos> Yo, J, you see?<eos> He didn't die.<eos> I knew that shit would work.<eos> Guess I lost that bet.<eos> Nah, he did.
I hired The Bulldog!<eos> The Bulldog!<eos> Milo K. Spevacek.<eos> He's famous. Attorney at law.<eos> You may have even sat on his face at a bus stop.<eos> Look, Maddie.<eos> No one thinks that I can do this.<eos> No one thinks that I can get my little girl back.<eos> No one believes that I can raise her by myself.<eos> But The Bulldog does.
Some new kids were just about to give me a chance.<eos> Don't try anything new, son.<eos> I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.<eos> But that would've been crazy.<eos> Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do.
Your man and Rosalee, too.<eos> No.<eos> Massa Tom ain't like Massa Earl was.<eos> Blood mean something to him.<eos> When Rosalee got too old to play with Miss Mary, he ain't put her out in the field like I was.<eos> He gonna look after her.<eos> I got to look after mine.<eos> Do whatever I can to protect my daughter.<eos> I know you understand that.<eos> I do.
It's disorienting.<eos> See, that's what he needs...<eos> some of that black magic.<eos> - Go talk to him.<eos> - No, it's only been a few days.<eos> He's still processing it himself.<eos> What do the PMs know?<eos> That I need them to close down the positions, not stampede the fuck out of the corral.<eos> But they're instinctive creatures, and without knowing exactly why, they feel antsy, which leads them to feeling restless, which leads to motherfucking anarchy if we don't rein it in.<eos> What do I do about the investors?
What the hell is his strategy?<eos> He knows we're not gonna give up the hunt just because he closes.<eos> Maybe he wants to quit while he's ahead.<eos> No one quits while they're ahead.<eos> This isn't France.<eos> It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that.<eos> Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
They were offering up a chunk of change, So we didn't ask.<eos> - Must have been a nice chunk of change For you to partner up with your ex-wife's other ex-husband.<eos> - Ha, yeah, yeah, it was.<eos> - So after the car was recovered, Did you find anything special in it?<eos> - Well, there were, uh...<eos> Two metal boxes about so big.<eos> They were real secretive about them, though.<eos> - Did they pay you what they owe you?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No, sir, they didn't.
Hmm. Honeypot.<eos> They're in trouble.<eos> Stay here.<eos> - I'm going with you.<eos> - I said stay here.<eos> No.<eos> Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't. You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do.
Then I can't see myself running the piece tonight.<eos> Mmm. Yummy.<eos> This is yummy.<eos> For years, I couldn't eat tripe.<eos> I thought I could still smell the shit in it.<eos> Then I hypnotized him out of it.<eos> - Mmm. You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Huh? - It only works on him. - Ah.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
How many helpings of strawberries did you have at lunch last week?<eos> Uh, two. Two.<eos> Uh, two. Two.<eos> If they arrested you, what would you do?<eos> I'd stand up, like Dollar Bill.<eos> Would you look me in the eye and spew lies about me on the witness stand?<eos> How did you respond to the SEC letter on Rubinex? I didn't.<eos> I gave it to my lawyer.<eos> I thought you said Rubinex never raised flags with the regulators.<eos> It didn't.
- It sure is.<eos> What's the problem with that girl?<eos> Is she a taboo subject?<eos> I want to know if she works well.<eos> Who cares?<eos> You're busting my balls.<eos> Well, you could say that she's bad at her job, that she's lousy.<eos> Cheer me up.<eos> No.<eos> She does a good job.
Yeah.<eos> My parents are so proud.<eos> What about Alexandre?<eos> If I accept the job, that's not the issue.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> - We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
What are we missing?<eos> What bit of her life is not on our radar?<eos> - Work?<eos> - She didn't work.<eos> Well, it's just I'm inputting the statement of the girl who found the body.<eos> She says she went to the pub because she worked there.<eos> Withholding information is as good as lying.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> Just didn't occur to me, that's all.<eos> She did a couple of shifts now and again.
How far's this from where the body was found?<eos> It's a good half-mile.<eos> There's a connection, isn't there?<eos> Cruelty to animals, cruelty to people.<eos> So they say.<eos> And it fits with the manner of her death.<eos> That was cruel.<eos> Kicking her when she's down.<eos> I know you think I didn't see ya.<eos> But I did.
It can be intimidating and exhausting.<eos> Are you getting enough sleep?<eos> - I will make sure of it.<eos> - No, you know what's exhausting?<eos> Sleeping on a closet floor with an innocent child who was kept in a bunker for 10 years.<eos> Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
The data flow itself is uninterrupted.<eos> My bet is that Axelrod built an enclosure that blocks external electric fields, making electronic surveillance impossible.<eos> It's really smart, actually, if you think about...<eos> Just clean up the audio file best you can.<eos> Donnie wasn't right.<eos> I think he's got the yips or something.<eos> We need to make sure he's not crashing.<eos> We'll go scoop him up.<eos> DeGiulio knows about our informant.<eos> Of course he does.
Insightful.<eos> This must be how Ali felt when Angelo Dundee whispered in his ear.<eos> Do you know what the press is saying about you?<eos> Didn't bother checking.<eos> I have a general idea.<eos> Well, they are clubbing you like a baby seal.<eos> It's time that you got out in front of this.<eos> You are a target for the Attorney General now.<eos> Maybe it's time you got out of there before you get fired.<eos> And do what? Hmm?
She was probing Walter for information.<eos> Is that right?<eos> It made be wonder about her continuing value.<eos> We're vulnerable, and so are they.<eos> I trust her.<eos> Mmm. Thank you.<eos> - Your Honor.<eos> - Counselor.<eos> - Mmm. - You didn't have to come.<eos> Oh, of course I did.
What's the radius on her powers?<eos> As far as she can go in one heartbeat.<eos> You're my new best friend.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here. Two figures, not moving but alive.<eos> Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
If I could wake up one morning without thinking about Maya dying, you know, if I could only remember the good stuff, like holding her hand for the first time and listening to our favorite music, you know, like when Finn gave you that necklace.<eos> Is that how it works, you can think of your first kiss and just be happy?<eos> Of course.<eos> My first kiss.<eos> That's not important now.<eos> Our mission is to...<eos> When was my first kiss?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't you?
I'm not the one who needs to be silenced.<eos> You'll tell them nothing.<eos> Lincoln!<eos> Cover me.<eos> Kom nau!<eos> All available guards to lock-up.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
I'm not sure.<eos> We made more than we needed.<eos> It's possible there could be a few still hanging around.<eos> Find them.<eos> Why?<eos> She may have found a way to disconnect.<eos> Then we have no choice.<eos> The wrist bands, where are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I do.
Ok.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> We don't.<eos> No one does, and we can use that.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Roan. He's got you doing everything wrong.<eos> - You're hiding.<eos> - I'm not hiding.<eos> I'm waiting for him to return with the Flame.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
He's reformed.<eos> I believe everyone deserves a second chance, but taking him with us on a covert mission doesn't seem like the place to test it.<eos> It's a crazy world out there, full of powered people.<eos> I finally have one of my own.<eos> I don't leave home without him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> He doesn't go, I don't go.<eos> Fine. We'll go without you.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> Actually, we do.
Are you Protestant or Catholic?<eos> I'm Catholic.<eos> Catholic.<eos> And the rite?<eos> The Abramelin.<eos> You're not fuckin' about.<eos> No.<eos> I've done this three times.<eos> Once it worked, twice it didn't.<eos> It didn't?
That's rubbish.<eos> You need someone there, someone who knows the procedure.<eos> Who told you that, Michael Stotes?<eos> You girls, you stupid, little posh girls.<eos> Abramelin procedure just to force love.<eos> It's like getting Titian to decorate a cake.<eos> I love this person.<eos> Get over him, just go on a fucking dating website or something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, I don't.
It is.<eos> You get to ask for what you want too.<eos> How much do you want it?<eos> More than anything.<eos> I'm having the bedroom with the bed in it.<eos> You will cook and clean.<eos> You do know what we're takin' on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you know the dangers?<eos> I do.
Don't forget what I'm doing for you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You can serve yourself, I'm not fucking hungry.<eos> But I told you, didn't I?<eos> This is the way that it works.<eos> It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
Unlike many of the other mammalians, and rather remarkably, members of the vulpes genre are found on every continent, save for Antarctica.<eos> Nor is this to say that the widespread distribution of the common red fox,<eos> Vulpes vulpes, with its many sub-genera, is meant to suggest a commonality with the household dog,<eos> Canis lupus familiaris, though there are marked similarities within the taxonomy of both animals.<eos> Which brings us, in the typically roundabout way of nature, to the arachnids.<eos> Take, for example, the modest desert scorpion.<eos> Now, can any of you tell me about, say, the Omdurman scorpion?<eos> Miss?<eos> Do you mean the "Deathstalker" scorpion, Dr. Sweet?<eos> Why, yes, Miss, I do.
Alec!<eos> I think I found it!<eos> Mary Milligan!<eos> Beloved servant?<eos> Who wants that on a headstone?<eos> Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Right.<eos> I don't know what the hell you are, angel doll, but you're one tasty treat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like to help me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Prime Minister, welcome. Is that our General Inhuman right there?<eos> It is.<eos> - Gang's all here. What's the plan?<eos> May and Hunter, you secure the Prime Minister.<eos> Daisy, Bobbi, Mack, contain the General.<eos> Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
It's time.<eos> I'll have your things sent to you.<eos> And frankly, you should be more careful when making your vacation plans next time.<eos> We are so sorry, sir.<eos> - It's all yours, Inspector.<eos> So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.
Come on, this way.<eos> So, what were you doing at the fairground?<eos> I wanted to ask about Brendan.<eos> Looked like you were trying to start a fight.<eos> - I'm not wanting to press charges.<eos> - Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
I knew that there was nothing we could do for him.<eos> Harris swore that it was an accident.<eos> But I knew what it looked like... .. and what it could do for our reputation.<eos> The fairground's finances a year ago were in a pretty sorry state. So I completely understand why you wouldn't want news of a fatal accident getting out to scupper things further.<eos> So instead of calling an ambulance or the police, you wrapped this lad's body in bin bags and slung him in an unmarked grave in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Then came back as if nothing had happened.<eos> - No, it wasn't like that.<eos> - Roll up, roll up!<eos> The show must go on...<eos> and it did.
You can paint any wall, take a picture" that's it.<eos> See, even if we believe that it is the same house" "but Manohar is claming that he was locked up in some other place.<eos> The real kidnapper could have taken the child there" ..and clicked his picture.<eos> If Manohar was locked up.. "then, how can he make the ransom call?<eos> Only if Manohar is speaking the truth?<eos> What if he's telling the truth?<eos> See, the kidnapper called from a PCO.<eos> Then he wiped his own fingerprints.<eos> But he left behind the cigarette butt.<eos> So under the circumstances he did two things.
He didn't commit this crime.<eos> He was locked in the warehouse.<eos> I gave you that CD.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Who said this to you?<eos> Manohar?<eos> He wants this to happen.<eos> And the other voice on the CD could be Manohar's as well.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> He did it.
- Good.<eos> You know where we stand then.<eos> Maybe you should do some counseling, Counselor.<eos> Hopefully before I change my mind.<eos> This is not a deal you walk away from.<eos> Not alive, no.<eos> You get them Brass and they get you away from the psychopath hunting you.<eos> It ain't just him. What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?<eos> What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?<eos> They didn't.
Plus, you can drive 20 miles in any direction and find some sand when you get homesick, right?<eos> I don't get that joke, but it sounds racist, and funny.<eos> Hi, Grandma!<eos> Hey.<eos> Could you watch Tanner a minute?<eos> I have to go pee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here we go!<eos> I think you look a little like me.<eos> Yes, you do.
Grace Wesley.<eos> We are adjourned.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Grace.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So you did have a plan.<eos> No.<eos> You did.
Yeah, 'cause I don't need to see where he's buried to say hi.<eos> Okay, but you haven't seen it.<eos> And since the funeral you haven't even seen his headstone.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do it tomorrow.<eos> I promised Ali I'd be available to her all day and she really needs me, so...<eos> I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong room.<eos> I didn't order that.<eos> I did.
Thank you always for your guidance and love.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but...<eos> Aria maybe.<eos> Why would Ali think that Aria had anything to do with Charlotte's death?<eos> Maybe she did.
-for sins he doesn't even know?<eos> -You think life is that simple, child?<eos> We will find them.<eos> You're warm.<eos> Do you bleed?<eos> -No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
- Where's my villain? - Okay.<eos> Um, she is getting ready, but I want you to, um, look at this.<eos> This is Beth Ann. She's from Mississippi.<eos> And this thing got 30,000 hits on Instagram, which is terrifying.<eos> Oh, Beth Ann.<eos> Aren't those even legal?<eos> Wait till she finds out she's here to bag a black man. Uh-oh.<eos> Okay, um, I also want to introduce you to London.<eos> She is our super-sexy Pakistani woman who might have distant links to Osama bin Laden.<eos> No, now she does.
Let's try these eyelashes.<eos> Okay, no. Really. Thanks.<eos> That's enough.<eos> No, no... that's not even close to enough.<eos> Look. You want to skip the lashes?<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> But I'm telling you, they would change your life.<eos> Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
Good.<eos> Now, you have every right to be upset, but here's the deal... there is not gonna be a problem with this whole immunity thing.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Because I like you.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You are a perfect match for Darius.<eos> Tiffany's not the only one who can be a football princess... or a queen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally... someone who gets me.<eos> Aww. I do, honey.
Come on, Tiffany.<eos> You and me.<eos> Well... this is gonna be interesting.<eos> Hey, Darius, I got to say, I don't think I could have planned your return any better myself, thank you very much.<eos> Well, lucky you.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> I mean, I got to ask you... what the hell are you doing?<eos> I mean, you picked Tiffany.<eos> That's great. - But we need to have an understanding.<eos> - No, we don't.
But first, let's take a look back at Tiffany and Chantal's journeys, two journeys which each began with one simple step.<eos> Oh, this is going to be so exciting.<eos> Cue the packages.<eos> The fact that I have to watch this stuff again nauseates me.<eos> Ugh. So we got Chantal's grandma.<eos> - She's in a car, she's on her way.<eos> - Great. She has no idea what's coming, does she?<eos> Do you ever feel bad about what we do to these girls? - Oh, my God!<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
That there's someone out there who has a vested interest in all of this.<eos> They are running it.<eos> Oh stop it!<eos> What about you, hey?<eos> Why are you involved in this?<eos> Cause... this person killed my mother.<eos> And I want to see him stopped.<eos> It's why I gave you the bracelet.<eos> But you don't know me!<eos> I do!
- Hello. D.I. Clayton.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Please.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Nice seagull!<eos> It's an albatross, dummy.<eos> Mr Lermontov will be with you shortly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He has the best view... in the best city in the world.<eos> I do, don't I?
- Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
Did he tell you how we made the case?<eos> No.<eos> As I am trying to say,<eos> - Did he tell you about the clothes we found in Bloom's apartment?<eos> Your genius here took fingerprints from the white breast placket of his shirt.<eos> Quite so, Mr. Reid, fingerprints.<eos> But accredited this time, given as evidence.<eos> The victim, Rabbi Ratovski's bloody fingerprints stuck on a shirt of Isaac Bloom.<eos> And not one word of denial did he make, Mr. Reid.<eos> He did so to me.
We need to do this properly through Covert Ops.<eos> I don't feel comfortable winging it like this.<eos> Now, you know how long that's gonna take and they won't let us do it anyway.<eos> Marghai just needs to believe that you want to sell your kidney.<eos> Once I'm in there, I'm in their hands!<eos> This might be our only shot at them!<eos> Why the hell would you hurry while I've been tracking all this down by myself?<eos> I'm withholding evidence that would sink you and you're still sneaking off doing God knows what!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> Damn right, I don't!
Not a word, Jake, not a word!<eos> She just texted.<eos> She'll be here in a minute.<eos> Sandalwood, a hint of citrus...<eos> Someone's very excited to see Emma this evening.<eos> - Beer in the fridge?<eos> - Yes, please!<eos> You're a tough bitch, Audrey.<eos> I thought they broke up.<eos> They did, sorta.
-I don't need your money, Mr. Caputo.<eos> It's nothing, take it, it's--<eos> Nah, this is not to help me. This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.<eos> -Okay, Joe, let's go.<eos> -The bullshit I pulled?<eos> I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill? I heard he had kidney stones. But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
- Don't move!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> It's six in the morning.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Couldn't sleep.<eos> Remembered we had some extra paint out back, and... it matches close enough, right?<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
Then it's day.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Against regulations, Miss.<eos> You know my name.<eos> You just told me you don't have a name.<eos> Oh, I was being poetic.<eos> Don't you like poetry?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> All the men I grew up with liked poetry.<eos> I don't.
I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> There's a lot we don't understand.<eos> It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
You did.<eos> We drew her deeper with every step, and now you would blame her?<eos> But the father of lies betrayed us all.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> Seen the future that we have built in our thirst for revenge.<eos> We have brought him back only to murder our own world and ourselves with it... unless we can stop him.<eos> But it is impossible.<eos> Not all of us together have any hope of stopping him.<eos> No.<eos> She, alone, does.
Neither backward nor forward.<eos> You once told me that... that love could not be known by reason, that it required only a faith.<eos> Well, I will take that leap, and I will trust you.<eos> And you must try and trust me, too.<eos> Can you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I can try.<eos> I hope this is a new beginning for us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> Yes, we do.
My bad, sorry, go ahead, look pretty.<eos> Once... Oh!<eos> That was a good one.<eos> Stiles!<eos> You're still in the photo.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You ruined it.<eos> Why would I want to ruin your yearbook photo?<eos> Maybe because you haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
Alex is gone, just like his parents, okay?<eos> The Ghost Riders took him, so you guys, you can't be alone.<eos> You got to stick with Scott or with me because I can see them.<eos> Why the hell are you lookin' at me like that?<eos> Do we even know him?<eos> I don't even know if he goes here.<eos> Do you go to this school?<eos> What's your name?<eos> You haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
I saw you get shot point-blank.<eos> It's high-density Kevlar, now... who the hell are you?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the Green Arrow.<eos> Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
- Thank you.<eos> How long will it be?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. 'Bye.<eos> It's all sorted.<eos> I'm glad nobody got hurt.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - See you. - See you.<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
- Nor you the opposite.<eos> Let's look at it backwards.<eos> Hello.<eos> Wouldn't the pieces fit if you'd taken the initiative in all of this?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
You're fast.<eos> You're strong.<eos> People like me need people like you to save our asses.<eos> I need you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're too smart to need anyone.<eos> And it's the smart ones who always survive.<eos> Then survive with me.<eos> Look, Scott's going to have a plan.<eos> They always do.
You got someone tailing me now?<eos> Why didn't you show up for dinner last night?<eos> Couldn't make it.<eos> You tell someone you're gonna be somewhere, you show up.<eos> Guess I didn't have my dad to teach me that, huh?<eos> Is this why you came to Central City?<eos> Not to get to know me or your sister, but this nonsense?<eos> No one in Keystone will race me anymore.<eos> But I don't actually have to explain myself to you.<eos> Actually, you do.
With all the... the wolfsbane in my system, I ain't healing so well.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> When we get a chance to fight, be ready.<eos> Hayley, Hayley, listen.<eos> I don't know if I'm gonna get that chance.<eos> Stop.<eos> We are gonna get out of here, Jack.<eos> I love you.<eos> Ok? - I've... I've always loved you.<eos> - Don't.
Yep.<eos> You know, when Aiden died, there were days when I would sit in Jackson Square just daring myself to take this ring off, to give up, and I think part of me knew that I was never gonna be that happy<eos> If there was any way to bring Aiden back,<eos> I would, no matter what.<eos> If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with...<eos> You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?<eos> In point of fact, you do.
I can't stay.<eos> I actually have somewhere to be.<eos> Oh!<eos> Great!<eos> Elliott told you?<eos> Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
I didn't wanna think that's what happened...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I, uh... We were just trying to help Ezra.<eos> You and his ex-girlfriend Aria?<eos> But it's not what it looks like.<eos> There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.
No, no, no.<eos> I, uh... We were just trying to help Ezra.<eos> You and his ex-girlfriend Aria?<eos> But it's not what it looks like.<eos> There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.<eos> I do...
Did Jillian like it?<eos> Was she pleased?<eos> Kinda, yeah.<eos> On a scale of one to ten ten being very pleased, over the moon......<eos> Ezra......<eos> - I need a number.<eos> Nine, eight and a half, I....<eos> Eight and a quarter.<eos> She had notes.<eos> Did she?
They're inspiring.<eos> So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.<eos> Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?<eos> We do.<eos> Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Dad, you may kiss mom.<eos> But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.<eos> It can't be Mona.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
No, she didn't do it.<eos> I did it.<eos> I leaked it.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Caleb, why are you saying this?<eos> Do you understand what this means?<eos> They were prepared to do the same to you.<eos> I.... Sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike.<eos> That wasn't your call to make.<eos> Mom, he didn't do this.
Gifts, expensive lingerie, cake?<eos> Like, made for you.<eos> Not when we have two monsters after us.<eos> Spencer's not answering.<eos> Yeah, well, she's probably still dealing with the fallout from the Yvonne leak.<eos> There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.<eos> Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay? If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
But I--I don't think it's good.<eos> You need to go there.<eos> Back for more?<eos> Does beating up on your little brother give you a little thrill?<eos> I'm not proud of what I did, Andy.<eos> In fact, I'm ashamed of it.<eos> You, John?<eos> Mr. High and Mighty?<eos> Do you remember the last time you beat on me until your knuckles bled?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Ah, long time, no see.<eos> We didn't finish our conversation.<eos> And what, I'm supposed to be so grateful, I'm just going to give up what I know about where Darhk is?<eos> Not likely.<eos> You make sure he's dead.<eos> Have you completely lost your mind?<eos> I don't have time for a debate.<eos> Good, because there's nothing to debate.<eos> What you did--<eos> What I did?
I...<eos> I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.<eos> And I can't let you die.<eos> I won't.<eos> That's not up to you.<eos> Look, I know how you take everything on, everyone's problems.<eos> It's one of the things I love the most about you.<eos> But you can't fix this one, Ollie.<eos> I have to try.<eos> No, you don't.
A life that hasn't had a chance to fully grow and live out its purpose in this world is a life that has been taken from this earth too soon.<eos> Oliver Queen, whom I'm told is practically family, will be delivering the eulogy.<eos> Mr. Queen.<eos> Mr. Queen, are you ready?<eos> Um, I could probably say a few words.<eos> Tommy Merlyn was--was one of the greatest people that I've ever known.<eos> He was--he was so much more than just... A billionaire playboy.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I loved him in-- in every way you could possibly love someone.<eos> And so did Oliver...
Thank you for meeting me.<eos> Of course, my baby girl.<eos> Oh, my God. Ha ha ha!<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I'm always here for you as long as there's no bees around.<eos> No bees.<eos> What--are you ok?<eos> Does the word Ravenspur mean anything to you?<eos> If this is something to do with your father, honey--<eos> So it does.
Look. I get it. You're mad at Darhk because he screwed you over, and now you're trying to get payback.<eos> I'm not gonna stop you, ok?<eos> If anything, I'm gonna help you, but there are innocent people here, people that have been brainwashed, and they don't deserve to die.<eos> Lonnie, don't do this.<eos> I will help you take down Darhk, ok?<eos> We can do this together.<eos> You just need to get out of here.<eos> What the hell did you do that for?<eos> I had him.<eos> No, you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> I know. When you two were married, it was like living at the Gap.<eos> Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.<eos> We did.<eos> I had a 7-year-old daughter, and I know all about gambling, and I wasn't willing to take the bet that your father could possibly change.<eos> He let me believe that he abandoned us.<eos> Well, I don't...
Why are you here?<eos> Because I was having a technical issue with my heart.<eos> Ugh, 16 hours on a plane, and that's what you came up with?<eos> I am touched you came all this way to see me.<eos> I'm so glad I did.<eos> You're even more beautiful than I imagined.<eos> Well, I have to admit you two do make a cute couple.<eos> But then again, so did Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.<eos> Do you take this woman to lecture you about trans fats for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.
♪ ♪<eos> All right, you guys. I will now do anything for ten dollars.<eos> Who's got something for me?<eos> I got one. I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
Come on!<eos> I knew you would screw this up.<eos> I should've done this myself.<eos> Go on, look at that!<eos> Them coal boys are gonna shit when they see what we done. Yep.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> Here.<eos> They are gonna shit.<eos> Look, this was good fun and all, but seriously, Foster, you gotta stop trying to kill me all the time.<eos> I never did.
Okay. Come in, file a report, and I'll get onto it.<eos> Oh, no, we'll handle it.<eos> You have other things to deal with.<eos> I know how overwhelmed you are.<eos> Think you're pretty smart.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're pretty smart.<eos> Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> Well, yes, I do.
But you didn't stop treating others?<eos> So...how's your Juliet?<eos> Did you kiss her yet or not?<eos> - Let it be, uncle.<eos> Why should I tell her?<eos> - So what?<eos> No need to be shy.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'll be really happy if you kissed her.<eos> You did...didn't you?
Welcome to the club.<eos> Gideon, what's happening on the Acheron?<eos> Funny you should ask.<eos> I just received a message from Mr. Rory.<eos> It seems he escaped capture and is now returning to the Waverider.<eos> Told you.<eos> Those pirates picked the wrong guy to mess with.<eos> Since when does Rory even know how to fly the jump ship?<eos> How did he even find us?<eos> Actually, I did the flying.
My powers were given by the Kree... yours by S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> They're the ones who made us.<eos> Why are you worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> Because I'm curious if you can defeat what made you.<eos> The people at S.H.I.E.L.D. are my friends.<eos> Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Evelina.<eos> whatever happens you must know everything.<eos> Do you know Sparen?<eos> the one who drowned.<eos> lying by the side of the road.<eos> He would have died if I hadn't helped him.<eos> I took him home and made him coffee.<eos> but I doubt it.<eos> I get up early....<eos> I did something terrible.
An illusion, created with a little gold thread.<eos> It's clever.<eos> I daresay, if all goes well today, this may very well be how I'm remembered.<eos> After all the missions, this flag may be my greatest accomplishment.<eos> Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.<eos> And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.
We came here to do a job, Crane, so keep searching.<eos> Dead men really tell no tales.<eos> You.<eos> Zombies again?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> This is a dark magic charm, giving its wearer the curse<eos> This is surely a tactic of General Howe's.<eos> He persuaded one of his spies to sacrifice his very humanity in order to sabotage Washington.<eos> Too bad good ol' George didn't see it coming.<eos> Or perhaps he did.
Think you'll be able to circle back with the wagon over there?<eos> I got the easy part of this plan.<eos> Let's see you get out first.<eos> I'm making it out with Rosalee.<eos> You just make sure you're there when we do.<eos> You were right.<eos> That bonnet belong to someone that I cared about.<eos> My daughter.<eos> - You had a daughter?<eos> - Still do.
Said gunshot residue matched the suspect's firearm.<eos> How do you account for this?<eos> The suspect was in motion as he turned his firearm towards my team.<eos> He covered a short distance between raising the gun and firing it.<eos> There's gunshot residue on the ground where the body was found.<eos> That's where he fired the gun.<eos> Why is there gunshot residue five metres away as well?<eos> My colleague has answered the question.<eos> Did the gun ever lie in a position on the ground five metres from the suspect?<eos> No, it did not.
I'm concerned about the interpersonal dynamics on the unit.<eos> So I'm going to disband Danny's squad.<eos> - What did Danny have to say about that?<eos> - He won't be the problem.<eos> The problem will be getting AFOs to work with him.<eos> I know he's not the easiest skipper, but he's good at his job.<eos> I'm learning loads from him, so I'd rather keep at it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah. If you move us on now, ma'am, it looks like we messed up, doesn't it?<eos> And we didn't.
At home, "Did you take your meds?"<eos> At work, "You're late.<eos> Pick up the pace."<eos> If you don't like it, leave.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Good!<eos> Go!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
- "Dav"?<eos> - Dave.<eos> Uh, Ian. His name's Ian.<eos> You look young, Ian.<eos> You still in high school?<eos> No, he, uh--<eos> I dropped out.<eos> Joined the army.<eos> Since when does the US Army accept high school dropouts?<eos> They don't.
Can you confirm your name is Alec Ramsay?<eos> You obviously know fine well who I am.<eos> Alec Ramsay, I'm charging you with being concerned in the sale or supply of controlled drugs.<eos> Drugs? My arse!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We have a warrant to search these premises for evidence.<eos> That gobshite Craig Cooper.<eos> He'd say anything to save his own skin!<eos> Yeah, he told me he owed you money.<eos> Aye, he did, but not for drugs.
Release my Cheez-Its!<eos> Aw, man, she really does need her full 11 hours.<eos> OK, I got to go home, check on the house, get a change of clothes.<eos> I need to fix this insurance stuff before Robert wakes up.<eos> And get a change of clothes.<eos> Did I say that? OK, this is what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go to your house so you can stay here<eos> -and take care of everything else.<eos> -I couldn't ask you to do that.<eos> Well, you didn't.
-No.<eos> -Will you give me a hint?<eos> It's the name of their favorite television show.<eos> I don't know, Trapper John, M.D.<eos> -I'm coming in.<eos> Move over.<eos> -It was Zig and Sharko.<eos> -Well, I was close.<eos> -I would've thought you knew that.<eos> I do.
Not at all.<eos> Because, uh, you didn't call me to come help with the kids.<eos> Mom, Jean jumped on a plane.<eos> Huh, and, uh, you told your father first that you were pregnant.<eos> To cheer him up.<eos> I was dying to tell you, Mom. I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
Margot had it made for me.<eos> She certainly looks after you. I'll give her that.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> So, what happened with you two?<eos> You were raking it in, making regular payments, and then suddenly, everything stopped.<eos> Now, my sister doesn't usually make mistakes.<eos> So... what went wrong?<eos> I got unlucky.<eos> It happens.<eos> Not to you, it doesn't.
This is my debt!<eos> It's my problem!<eos> It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you.<eos> I am doing this alone.<eos> Let me help.<eos> I want to help.<eos> You want to help me steal a bracelet?<eos> I want to help you not die.<eos> You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.<eos> No, I don't.
Uh, waiter, can we have some menus, please?<eos> Do you want to know the secret to a good relationship?<eos> Oh, this'll be good, coming from the woman whose husband killed himself.<eos> Your father didn't kill himself.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> I assume you know that because you murdered him.<eos> The secret to a healthy relationship is not wanting anything.<eos> Tell her, Ben.<eos> I don't want anything from you!<eos> Of course you do, darling.
I want you to take this and go back to Cabo, Morocco, the place in Rome... just get as far away from here as you can.<eos> What is going on?<eos> The family is going down.<eos> And I'm trying to keep you out of it.<eos> What about you?<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> Reggie, please.<eos> You are getting rid of the one person you can trust in all this.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do.
She was too scared to.<eos> She still is.<eos> - But no contact information for Margot?<eos> - No. And no record of a Margot Bishop entering the country.<eos> And the only alias we have is Jessie Philips.<eos> Even the QR19 software couldn't find a match.<eos> So we don't know anything.<eos> We don't know where she is, what she's doing.<eos> We have no way to find her.<eos> We actually do.
- I can't, either.<eos> - I really can't.<eos> - I know.<eos> No, no. You can't promise that.<eos> What you can promise is that you will grow tired of each other.<eos> Wow. Sweetie.<eos> You will have an affair with your personal trainer.<eos> You know, who knows?<eos> We just don't know.<eos> We don't, do we?
Rhys got a little too empathetic with Morgan's Mommy issues.<eos> Does Sybil know?<eos> She'll find out.<eos> And then kill you.<eos> She won't have to.<eos> Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
And child exploitation with intent to distribute, which is 5 to 20 years in jail.<eos> - Who are you calling?<eos> - Our friend at the FBI.<eos> Nathan Ashmore's about to discover there is such a thing as bad press.<eos> With Nathan on trial as a sex offender,<eos> PMG will have no choice but to sever ties with Ashmore Records, and you'll be free.<eos> The thing is, Nathan was right.<eos> People know who I am.<eos> They're buying the record.<eos> So what do I do?
-did you see that?<eos> -yes.<eos> Everybody saw those.<eos> Yeah, everybody saw those. Everybody saw That he's a dumbass, And his life is ruined.<eos> -he got drunk. That's all. -$55.54.<eos> well, i don't know What he was doing,<eos> But that's out there Forever, all right? And once it's out there, There's not anything Anybody can do about it, so -- So don't be him.<eos> Well, i'm not him, Nor do i even know him.<eos> So, i don't know why You have to assume I'm gonna do Something wrong.<eos> I don't.
If Valentine gets his hands on the Cup...<eos> We know.<eos> If Valentine started creating Shadowhunters or gained control of demons, it'd be like Beyonce riding on a dinosaur through Times Square.<eos> People would notice.<eos> But he can control demons. I've seen it.<eos> Mmm, paying off a few demons is easy, especially since they rarely survive long enough to collect.<eos> Still waiting on Valentine's thank-you card.<eos> Opening the gates of hell... that's a little more tricky.<eos> Valentine doesn't have the cards.<eos> I do.
It goes here.<eos> And when we get a gaming system, we're gonna need to get a second HDMI cord, and you're gonna have to change the input from HDMI1 to HDMI2 every time...<eos> Babe, who cares about her?<eos> She's a crazy old bitch.<eos> No, no, no, she hates me. Okay?<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Mrs. McBride is a big bully and a big perv.<eos> Probably hasn't been laid since VCRs were invented.<eos> And if she doesn't like us, who gives a shit?<eos> Well, I do.
Regular mail? I don't send mail.<eos> Most of the mail I do get, I don't read.<eos> Never had an e-mail account.<eos> Warden can verify all this, if you don't believe me.<eos> Then, who is behind this?<eos> Who? I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is:<eos> Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
I want my mama.<eos> I know, I know, but this is what they want.<eos> What happened to Willa? Did--<eos> She got sick, all right?<eos> Come on, let's go inside.<eos> Madison, what have you done now?<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> We have room.<eos> - Put him back where you found him. - We have room.<eos> We do not.
Say something, Esther.<eos> I love you.<eos> Say something else.<eos> No.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't want it. Patty can't get hurt over this. Tachyons!<eos> 87th and Avenue J.<eos> Must be one of Mercury Labs' off-site facilities.<eos> Hack into their se...<eos> I've hacked in the security feed.<eos> - And once that...<eos> It's charged.<eos> You can go now.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did.
D-Did I ruin this?<eos> Us?<eos> I just think... we need to work on ourselves before we can talk about us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The stuff that I did, Lincoln, I can't live with it.<eos> I remember that pain -- sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I --
I've hit bottom.<eos> I know what it's like to be so addicted to something that you'd do anything to get her back.<eos> Hive and his worker bees will be down here any second.<eos> And then?<eos> Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now, timed with their ascent.<eos> I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but --<eos> I do.
You... you should have killed me when you had the ch... You owe us an explanation.<eos> Yes, it's quite remarkable Mr. Rory is working for the Time Masters, considering you killed him.<eos> If you think back, I never actually said I killed him.<eos> No, you just let us think that you did.<eos> I didn't have to try too hard, did I?<eos> Well, maybe I should have.<eos> And at least he wouldn't have would up a chew toy for the Time Masters.<eos> But if you did, we wouldn't have this opportunity.<eos> An opportunity?<eos> To do what?
I'm glad.<eos> Did something happen today?<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> What?<eos> Our neighbour, Mr. Nishino.<eos> He gave me the creeps.<eos> Yeah? How come?<eos> He wouldn't talk to me properly.<eos> He's odd, like he has no social skills.<eos> Some people don't.
Yeah, you did.<eos> You did it.<eos> - All right, well, show's yours, brother.<eos> - Let's go. Enjoy.<eos> Man of the hour.<eos> - Big day, man.<eos> - Congrats. Thank you. This place looks great.<eos> When you address the crowd today, make sure that you thank the mayor because he pulled a lot of strings putting this entire deal together.<eos> Um, I don't have to do any speeches, do I?<eos> - He doesn't do speeches.
I'm very sorry, Father, but if I had known that today was...<eos> Father, why don't you take Thomas?<eos> Yes, that's a wonderful idea.<eos> Why don't you take Thomas?<eos> "Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arm, quite vanquished him, then burst his mighty heart."<eos> Get him dressed.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Did you bring me breakfast?<eos> - Christ!<eos> Did you?
Should I have left him there in the street to die?<eos> The last thing I wanted to do is get you caught up in this.<eos> What are you doing here so early?<eos> I came in to do inventory.<eos> That's dead.<eos> The Authority never switched it back on.<eos> - Did you talk to Lagarza?<eos> - Phone's dead.<eos> No, landlines are all supposed to work.<eos> - Well, they don't.
Just listen to me, alright?<eos> Good lookin'.<eos> You a hooker?<eos> Are you?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing...<eos> You called the cops?<eos> No way...<eos> - This car...<eos> - Did you?
Elijah thinks I should return home and heal him.<eos> Ease his pain.<eos> Klaus, you should go.<eos> As soon as these last few recover, I'll get them home, gather what I can and torch this place.<eos> No.<eos> Finn can purge it himself.<eos> He's earned the agony.<eos> Besides, you know how much I love burning things to the ground.<eos> Klaus, when you said that you wanted to work together for Hope's sake, I wanted to see what that looked like.<eos> And now I do.
So what's the problem?<eos> Everything comes with a price.<eos> In order to take power from the Ancestors, you have to steal it.<eos> Which means, to make Lucien killable, I'll have to draw through Davina, while she's in the Ancestral Well.<eos> And to do that, I will have to break the circle that protects her.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> - Freya, that will destroy her.<eos> - I know what's at stake, Elijah.<eos> I know.<eos> What the hell do we do?
Oh, please, Cami.<eos> Have you not learned?<eos> If you try to fight me, you will always lose.<eos> Enough.<eos> If you insist on making things difficult...<eos> - Klaus?<eos> - What is it?<eos> Something happened and you're gonna be angry, but Lucien wants you to be angry.<eos> He's trying to lure you into a trap.<eos> What did he do?
How about a magical miracle baby?<eos> You are going to wake them, aren't you?<eos> I've got a party to finish.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> Ah. Still smarting over the whole Cami thing?<eos> Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I can.<eos> If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.<eos> Of course I do!
- Yeah, do it already, man, yeah. Yeah? Yeah?<eos> Where's that hammer?<eos> Where's the hammer, huh?<eos> Can't you just smash it on the floor?<eos> Oh, you don't think I'll do it?<eos> No, I'm gonna do it!<eos> - Do it. You bought it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Fine! - No, I didn't!<eos> - Yeah, actually, you did.
They need a car for the thing. Get dressed.<eos> We'll go get it.<eos> - Baz said I should... - What?<eos> Baz said I should go with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He said get a car.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Hey, kid!<eos> You don't remember our faces. Say it.<eos> I don't, I don't.
That's a beautiful thing.<eos> Say, Sally-Ann, tell me.<eos> H-how do you get your hair to go like that, like it does?<eos> Looks like you got a light coming off of it.<eos> You got a boyfriend?<eos> Hasil, come on!<eos> What prithee said Ruckus tonight?<eos> Went on a run is all, lady Ray.<eos> I didn't give no order.<eos> I did.
When you fell in the mine?<eos> See, whatever happens up there, we know about it one way or the other.<eos> The fate of Shay Mountain rests with us, Wade.<eos> You and me.<eos> So before you go and kill our paradise, that mountain wanted you to know what it felt like to die, and now you do.<eos> You think on that.<eos> My guy doesn't know anything.<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
Did you see if the store was open earlier when you came home?<eos> Was it open?<eos> No, it wasn't?<eos> Jake, talk to me.<eos> Audrey, hi.<eos> No, no, I haven't heard from her.<eos> Today I got home early and the store was closed.<eos> I feel responsible. We are responsible.<eos> Audrey will tell you if she thinks you owe her money. - Don't worry about it.<eos> - Well, she sort of did already.
A 30% service fee?<eos> That's not legal.<eos> That's standard...<eos> I-I've heard.<eos> ♪ I'm the one who makes you feel alive ♪ Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me, Miss?<eos> Are one of you girls using the toilet stall as a babysitter again?<eos> 'Cause if so, Donnie's gonna flip.<eos> I just really need my mom.<eos> Baby, girl, we all do.
- How do you feel?<eos> - It's embarrassing.<eos> Is the action team here yet?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - Are you all right? - It looks like I did that to you.<eos> People would think we were bullying you.<eos> Go ahead and wipe it off.<eos> We should wipe your body.<eos> - Do you want me to do it?<eos> - Please do it.
You too, Professor.<eos> I'm not sanctimonious.<eos> You're just a hypocritical prick then?<eos> You slept with him.<eos> And?<eos> "And?"<eos> I don't want to fight with you. It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now. Haha!<eos> But I do, too.
This way. Leave us alone.<eos> I hope you brought me a Transit Pass.<eos> Snyder cancelled the deal.<eos> Can you disappear in this bloc?<eos> I could hide in your house for six months. You'd never even know I was there.<eos> But here's the play:<eos> you claim that these idiots didn't search me in the right way.<eos> You walked in here, I got the jump on you, and you had to help me out the back door.<eos> And I never see you again.<eos> No one does.
Perhaps.<eos> But more than likely, your mother paid<eos> Magnus handsomely for his magic.<eos> Warlocks usually require payment before they help anyone with anything.<eos> Word from the Clave is that most of the warlocks have gone into hiding since Valentine began hunting them.<eos> Valentine must be searching for the warlock, where did Jocelyn...<eos> Hodge, your rune.<eos> You okay?<eos> - So how do we find Magnus?<eos> - We don't.
You're the only other person she would have trusted with the location of the Cup.<eos> If she trusted me so much, why didn't she tell me any of this?<eos> She didn't think this was gonna happen.<eos> She made provisions just in case it did.<eos> The potion, Dot...<eos> Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past.<eos> - That it would unlock you.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> I don't know!<eos> But you do.
You can understand that.<eos> Yeah I do, Nina.<eos> I do.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Clifton: Nina.<eos> What?<eos> You have a daughter, right?<eos> From your first marriage?<eos> Yes I do.
My bad.<eos> It's almost sunrise.<eos> Simon must be turned into a vampire tonight or staked through the heart.<eos> And if I do neither?<eos> His soul will be trapped for eternity.<eos> You have till sunset to decide.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Remember what you said to me the morning of our wedding?<eos> We weren't supposed to see each other until the ceremony, but you... you wouldn't listen to rules.<eos> You never did.
What else?<eos> Oh. Babysitting Jace.<eos> And dealing with our parents who are trying to find him a wife.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's quite all right.<eos> I suppose Alec is just following his duty.<eos> Not everyone gets the luxury of following their heart.<eos> I'm gonna go deliver the preliminary findings.<eos> It seems like you have everything under control here.<eos> Luke, what do I do?
- ♪ Dr. Lawson<eos> - Hank.<eos> ♪ You're gonna be okay ♪<eos> - ♪ Dr. Hank ♪<eos> - Just Hank.<eos> ♪ You always save the day ♪<eos> ♪ Thank you, Hank ♪<eos> ♪ That's what we came here to say ♪<eos> ♪ I had hypertensive nephropathy ♪<eos> Yeah, you did.
Perfect, Julio, thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Last night...<eos> I burst into tears.<eos> I was tucking in Lucas and thought what a shitty world I brought him into.<eos> What would become of him if something happened to his mother or me?<eos> He looked at me and asked me if I was hurt.<eos> The poor kid was scared, of course.<eos> - Do you guys have kids?<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Whose was it?<eos> Well, the apartment was hers.<eos> But she rented it out.<eos> That's why it was almost empty.<eos> She lived in another apartment of hers in the Salamanca district.<eos> What was the rape like?<eos> Brutal.<eos> The poor lady was a wreck.<eos> And if you're going to ask me if we have her fucking DNA,<eos> - we don't.
Close all the exits and stop all the trains.<eos> Exits and trains!<eos> Now!<eos> Come on, move it!<eos> Everyone in the left corner.<eos> Sesmillo, read.<eos> 96 civil lawsuits against the police, 21 treated by paramedics, 2 cervical injuries.<eos> 567,000 euros in losses, complaints from 7 embassies and a man with a fractured hip.<eos> - We'll take responsibility but we got him.<eos> - No, Alfaro, we don't.
Six?<eos> Cut like that and then nailed like that.<eos> Hello, Mom.<eos> Somethin' happened a couple of days ago.<eos> I think, uh...<eos> I think I might have helped save a little boy.<eos> Reverend says that I saved you too.<eos> All I know is I put you here.<eos> I made you like this.<eos> After what you did to me...
How did things go with Prudence?<eos> She seems determined to marry Cyrus.<eos> So maybe it's a sign.<eos> Have Alistair's blood tested.<eos> Be with your true love.<eos> Find... life outside of these walls.<eos> I was listening to Liam's speech, watching him these last few days.<eos> He's so clearly Simon's son.<eos> - But you don't know that.<eos> - I do.
She acts like her entire life has been one big sacrifice for this family.<eos> It hasn't been.<eos> She poisoned that horse because she wanted to be someone.<eos> Not for you, for her.<eos> It's despicable.<eos> - How's Eleanor?<eos> - I don't know, Mum.<eos> How's Violet?<eos> Tell me now if you had anything to do with the fact she's missing.<eos> - I didn't!
- Or Grand Duchess.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You just said some words, Mom.<eos> I'd rather you shout at me than stab me twice and leave me for dead.<eos> I'm with Liam.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's something else.<eos> Tomorrow, if we fail and they succeed, remember that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
You're the only person I can trust.<eos> Well, sweetheart, you don't break into my house and then talk to me about trust.<eos> Don't overthink it.<eos> It's just a bunch of guys in business suits.<eos> They won't know what hit them.<eos> Would be fun, like old times.<eos> Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you... - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, not anymore.
But you and I, we've seen it.<eos> The Hand is very real.<eos> And they know we're onto them.<eos> The battle has begun, Matthew.<eos> There's nothing we can do about it now but fight.<eos> Look...<eos> I wish I could tell you that I'm not going to pull my sword...<eos> - but I will if I have to.<eos> - You said you wanted to be good.<eos> - I do.

I doubled the cut that Dutton was paying them.<eos> But that didn't work out, did it?<eos> No, I was wrong.<eos> That's difficult to admit, but... you have a gift, Mr. Castle.<eos> I assumed that the stories that I read in the paper about your attacks on the criminal world were apocryphal.<eos> How could one man be capable of such... violence?<eos> But then I saw it... with my own two eyes.<eos> And when one comes across someone with such talent... with such a gift... well... you don't let that go to waste.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
We were together only for moments.<eos> That was all.<eos> Orchids.<eos> She likes orchids.<eos> And, yeah, Stick... it was worth it.<eos> Matt, you are the toughest son of a bitch I have ever met.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> I came to New York thinking there's no way I could feel lonely in a city of millions.<eos> But you do.
The enemy had set up an ambush at the only LZ that would accommodate one of our birds.<eos> Sorry, Colonel?<eos> LZ is a landing zone that can accommodate a helicopter.<eos> So the enemy, they block this landing zone, knowing it was the only shot the team had to get out alive.<eos> All they had to do was wait.<eos> They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
Kid... pulls the knife from the breast of his dead mother and goes to work.<eos> He cuts down some of the Hand's finest warriors.<eos> They're lying dead... kid's standing.<eos> They give him a name.<eos> The Chaste.<eos> And he's just one kid?<eos> Alone?<eos> Kid grows up, rounds up every warrior he can.<eos> Men, women, young, old, doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.<eos> And they do.
As I'd hoped, you've provided me with a solution to my problem.<eos> I don't get it, Grey.<eos> What's in here that's gonna fix me?<eos> Well, nothing inside the Jumpship, Jefferson, but rather the craft itself.<eos> You see, this ship is pre-programmed to return to 2016.<eos> I've made some additional adjustments according to the theory of quantum-retro causality, and if my math is correct, the trip through the Time Stream should reverse your condition.<eos> No. No.<eos> I'm not leaving you or the team.<eos> Which is why I'm not giving you a choice.<eos> What did you do?
I'm healed.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yes. Yes, back to my normal, devilish self.<eos> No pesky empathy to be found.<eos> I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.<eos> I'm joking.<eos> Puppies don't waltz.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> I don't have insecurities. Mm.<eos> Everyone does.
Right, on you go, then.<eos> Go on, fetch away.<eos> Well, go on, then.<eos> Uh, is this too advanced for her?<eos> You're funny.<eos> Trixie, babe, come on.<eos> Get ready.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> I had no idea that Hot Tub High School paid so well.<eos> It didn't.
See what happens.<eos> And there's that angelic ego I was talking about.<eos> I'm sorry, uh...<eos> You were saying?<eos> Gentlemen, please...<eos> Don't mind my brother.<eos> He's just a bit... simple.<eos> We meant no disrespect, truly.<eos> I thought you told me you wanted your wings back.<eos> I do.
No one could've shot Malcolm and fled without me seeing them.<eos> - Now you're making my point.<eos> - Because there was no obvious exit.<eos> But maybe, just maybe... hear me out... there was a secret one.<eos> Chloe, you are stabbing hard at something<eos> - that's just not there.<eos> - There's got to be an explanation for what I saw, Dan!<eos> There has to be.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> I don't...
Uh... don't.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I realized a few things.<eos> As I said, we made a breakthrough.<eos> And I think, with that in mind, we should keep our relationship professional from now on. Oh.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well. If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
Have you seen him?<eos> !<eos> He was down here on his phone. Heard him talking to someone named Connor.<eos> - He left to go meet him. - He left?<eos> Where to?<eos> Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in. No.<eos> He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant.<eos> Put his faith in God, not the police.<eos> Why do you care about a priest?<eos> I don't.
- Then it's a frame job.<eos> Who would want to set him up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Detective, we may have found the murder weapon. Okay.<eos> Test it for prints and DNA.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Sorry, pal.<eos> One use only.<eos> Come out, honey!<eos> Mommy, is it over?<eos> Yeah, baby, it's over.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hi. Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.<eos> Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.<eos> I thought he killed you.<eos> Oh, he did.
Afraid.<eos> I know.<eos> I once went to sleep for a long time, too.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> But when I woke up, I wasn't alone.<eos> You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
No! The others went to the furnace.<eos> My wife and daughters burned.<eos> I escaped.<eos> I survived. To my great shame.<eos> I will hear my family's screams until the day I die.<eos> Look at me.<eos> J'onn, look at me.<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
My race gone.<eos> If I'm all that's left, let it have me.<eos> No, this murderer does not get to win. And you don't get to give up.<eos> It will save Alex.<eos> We don't choose.<eos> We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
You taste like vagina.<eos> So, did you figure it out yet, you piece of shit?<eos> Rub my nose in it.<eos> What happened?<eos> -I went to visit her. -Mmm-hmm.<eos> Made it worse.<eos> Well, did you make it about her? Or did you make it about yourself?<eos> I apologized to her.<eos> I thought you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Yeah. Well, I didn't.
Want to keep you apprised of what's happening.<eos> Mostly I wanted you to hear it from me.<eos> Man-to-man.<eos> I hear you loud and clear.<eos> - Thanks for stopping by.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, market penetration is only as good as the guys in the field.<eos> So I talked to Zak.<eos> He's okayed two full-time reps.<eos> - Zak did?
You're lucky you're not in the trunk of one of them.<eos> An entire file drawer of phony registrations, fake plates, VIN numbers...<eos> the whole magilla.<eos> Galasso's number two.<eos> Fucking feds are gonna shit.<eos> - Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
Emile Fisher?<eos> He's in prison.<eos> Not as of two weeks ago.<eos> He just finished doing every single day of his time, so no probation officers to keep tabs on him.<eos> Emile gets out two weeks ago, and the gun comes back.<eos> - Where is he? Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey.<eos> Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
And are you aware that at the time of her death,<eos> Rachel and Mark had been having... sleeping together.<eos> I believe that's the, uh, socially accepted euphemism.<eos> Only it was more than that.<eos> She wasn't just some one off in the back of a Crown Vic.<eos> Mark was in love with her.<eos> Thought about Rachel night and day.<eos> Obsessed.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, she did before the Price trial.
Guess it doesn't matter now.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's right. Tamika was with him, and she was concerned about getting arrested.<eos> Daniel was already in jail and the cops were looking for Emile.<eos> And he and Tamika were arguing.<eos> About what?<eos> Your head ain't right.<eos> I threw it after we crossed the overpass.<eos> E, we wasn't even on the freeway.<eos> How do you know where I threw it, huh?<eos> E. Huh? You don't.
E. Huh? You don't.<eos> That's right, 'cause you crying in the backseat.<eos> Come on, E.<eos> You was tripping, doing hits.<eos> This is why you all turned around now.<eos> What's your Pretty Boy talking about, huh?<eos> Easy over here don't remember where he ditched the gun.<eos> Don't listen to her, dawg.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I do.
Are you nervous?<eos> It's only boys.<eos> Once you get the blood rushing to their dicks, they're like your servants.<eos> All I gotta do is convince the one guy who always watches me to go inside and party with the others.<eos> Then there's ten minutes before I drive the day shift up.<eos> Ten minutes for Alonso to grab that shit from the wheel well.<eos> Shit.<eos> -Go now.<eos> -What?<eos> Do it!
Here, I just got this.<eos> - A ransom demand for $2 million?<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - We don't have that kind of money. - Unfortunately, the kidnappers think you do, but the good news is,<eos> - it means he is still okay.<eos> - Wait, but why? I mean, if they're working for Voynov, wouldn't they want to kill him?<eos> - What?<eos> - Really?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, but she doesn't.
We have to move on.<eos> I can't.<eos> Sorry, Mum. But we were part of something.<eos> We saved them.<eos> I can't "move on" from that.<eos> And why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does...
Master, forgive me!<eos> I won't steal the Boots of Iron again.<eos> There is no room for a scoundrel like you here.<eos> Leave.<eos> Master!<eos> I really want to learn Kung Fu of the Iron Kick.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't deserve it?<eos> And Wu does?
I'll make sure I get one for him when we catch that girl.<eos> 12-year-old boy and she just stabs him.<eos> Think I'm gonna let that pass?<eos> You plan on killing that girl all of a sudden?<eos> No. I plan on killing her slow.<eos> That ain't gonna happen.<eos> Patty's all about her numbers, and we took a big hit here today.<eos> The only way to recoup that balance sheet is to catch Rosalee alive and get her reward.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
Rafael, I know exactly what it feels like to be angry with God.<eos> My husband, Brad, he was... he was the love of my life, and God ripped him away from me.<eos> Afterwards, I was just consumed with rage.<eos> I was his most faithful servant.<eos> Why take my Matthew?<eos> I asked myself the exact same question when I lost Brad.<eos> All of that pain, it is... it is overwhelming, isn't it?<eos> It burns.<eos> And that's why you felt the need to take the lives of those boys because each time you took one from this world, you thought that it would stop that pain.<eos> But it didn't, did it?
I hated my mom, too.<eos> I miss her like hell now though.<eos> That's all I'm gon' say about that.<eos> What's a faggot?<eos> A faggot is... a word used to make gay people feel bad.<eos> - Am I a faggot?<eos> You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.<eos> I mean, unless...<eos> How do I know?<eos> You just do.
After what I just did, what I just became?<eos> Hill didn't give you much of a choice.<eos> Maybe if I had been there...<eos> No, don't.<eos> You couldn't have stopped me.<eos> I couldn't stop myself. That wasn't you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Vincent, what are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
I mean, it's not like there's some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.<eos> I just wish there was something else I could think about, you know?<eos> Hey, what about our senior project?<eos> - Maybe we could do something together?<eos> - You know what I need?<eos> I need to meet someone new.<eos> I need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
These are not your friends.<eos> These are not your friends.<eos> The whole prison's been compromised.<eos> Compromised.<eos> She has an earpiece.<eos> You can see it.<eos> Look at them!<eos> They're all in it together.<eos> Good, beautiful morning, guys.<eos> How you doing?
Well, then why are you acting like you do?<eos> Because he knew I could forgive almost anything but this, with her.<eos> Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
Oh, yeah.<eos> But he's got medical training, so they let him do his work detail in here.<eos> Lucky bastard.<eos> You held your own against Nyx.<eos> Not bad.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - Solitary.<eos> Can't have fighting in my prison.<eos> She was attacking my friend.<eos> Yeah, she does that.
Maybe there's something to it.<eos> Or maybe you've just spent too much time on that ship.<eos> It's made you paranoid. No.<eos> If anything, it's woken me up.<eos> Made me realize the dangers of being too trusting.<eos> I brought you something.<eos> When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> You manage to crack the file? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You were on sick leave. I came to visit you.<eos> I thought you deserved to know, so I told you.<eos> You told me the truth?<eos> About the bomb? Yeah, you were pissed off.<eos> Hell, you nearly broke my jaw.<eos> But I... I went back to work.<eos> Of course you did, because you realized there was no other choice.<eos> This is their game, and we are just their soldiers.<eos> We don't push back.<eos> Like hell we don't.
My entire life.<eos> So I never married... till you...<eos> Because I believed in you.<eos> I was trying to help you.<eos> No. You were killin' me.<eos> Killin' me.<eos> And I couldn't see it.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I do.
Out loud.<eos> Always the technicalities with you.<eos> If they're talking, we will hear them.<eos> The question is, will we hear the Master talking back?<eos> We just need to look for anomalies, anything that breaks the established communication patterns.<eos> You never rendered your opinion on Captain Rogers.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You know,<eos> Fet's new comrade-in-arms.<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
Shall I tell him you're headed in to see him?<eos> No, but let me know if he leaves.<eos> You need to let me deal with this.<eos> Mary, that thing that I fought, that thing that killed eight people, it could only have been created by one person.<eos> We need to find Albert Lin before he does it again, so if you're afraid of how I might question your brother,<eos> - you should just stay home.<eos> - I'm afraid for you.<eos> You need to be back in the tank in just over an hour, so let me deal with Otto.<eos> You protected him your whole life.<eos> If Otto did this...
You need to let me explain.<eos> No, you need to meet me downstairs, both of you.<eos> These agents will make sure you don't get into anymore trouble.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr. Graff, I want to assure you none of this was approved by the Bureau.<eos> Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.<eos> None of the agents did, just me.
That only makes me love you more.<eos> We are gonna be so happy together.<eos> - You were there, behind the light. - Yeah.<eos> You were the man behind the light.<eos> My friend Mr. Widowmaker around?<eos> No, not since you beat the crap out of him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, uh... I'll take a cutter.<eos> Cutter? Don't know what that is.<eos> Sure you do.
Yeah. Good eye.<eos> You really think Duke Davis had something to do with an axe murder?<eos> No, I'm suggesting that he took the video footage to cover up whoever he had do it.<eos> I knew this guy back when he was starting up.<eos> The union tried to squeeze him out of a contract. He had the organizer dumped in the bay.<eos> What do you mean, "Dumped in the bay?"<eos> I mean he was alive and then he wasn't and he was dumped in the bay.<eos> And guess what, security footage was missing.<eos> So now you think he needs a visit from the Sheriff.<eos> Damn right he does.
There will be some soreness, but the tank healed the fractured ribs.<eos> You think my son's just gonna walk away 'cause you gave him a spanking in your office?<eos> I think I made it clear he has no choice. Why?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think Duval is an honest-to-God good person.<eos> I think that's probably something he got from his mother.<eos> I think with lives on the line, my son will ruin his career.<eos> When he's gone to jail, he could tell the FBI about me and the bridge, about the car tracing back to Lookinglass.<eos> Duval will expose it all if it helps catch those killers.<eos> So, what do we do?
It smells of history, you know, old Seattle.<eos> Pritchard, wait!<eos> Three passports have been requested from a forger Emma knows.<eos> Three?<eos> There are two cons.<eos> One's for Stax, one's for Hume, and one's for a little girl.<eos> I'll find out if Stax or Hume has a daughter.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> - Why do we have to leave?<eos> - We just do.
Wally Luskin.<eos> Wally the weasel?<eos> ! He dealt weed and... and he drove a molester van.<eos> I bet he got the full sheriff.<eos> Look, she hadn't seen him in years.<eos> They ran into each other a few months ago, and they hit it off.<eos> She says that Wally has changed.<eos> She needs this to work. Do you understand?<eos> Uh, Duval, you remember Wally.<eos> - I do.
Yeah, this first, then that.<eos> Something you said on this might help us find Albert Lin... Magic Land?<eos> We used to go there as kids. It was a lot smaller then.<eos> In the summer, we went every day when we could scrape enough money together.<eos> We called it our home away from home.<eos> Home away from home.<eos> Not that I don't think you're good at your job, but... I was hoping they'd send other agents.<eos> They're mounting up.<eos> I knew you wouldn't wait for backup.<eos> No. I don't.
- We've established I'm unlucky.<eos> There's a lot of that luck going around.<eos> Oh, it's healing well.<eos> - Still sensitive?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well... Keep doing whatever you are doing, you don't need me.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Do you treat a lot of Nazis?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Because I do.
Oh, you can skip the performance.<eos> They've written a book about you, you've been immortalized.<eos> We don't need the whole child-killer routine.<eos> Charmer.<eos> Is he like this with you?<eos> You confessed to murdering him.<eos> That's because I did it.<eos> Yeah, you know... new evidence suggests that's highly unlikely.<eos> New evidence?<eos> OK then, I didn't.
And my very expensive iPad isn't good enough for him?<eos> - It was on the side, you can't miss it.<eos> - You can't know that.<eos> It was Jesse.<eos> He was in his old room, looking for photos.<eos> I know it was...<eos> I felt something, still do.<eos> No, you just wanted it to be him.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Or maybe I do.
-Is that what gets you off?<eos> You're being mean to me.<eos> Because I just realized how much better off I was without you.<eos> How can you say that to me?<eos> -Because you're a bully.<eos> -How am I a bully?<eos> You bullied me into Phil.<eos> You bully me into feelings.<eos> I don't want to feel!<eos> Then don't.
It won't happen again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Bet.<eos> I won't make any moves without talking to you first, but you got to let me help.<eos> If we're gonna be partners, then let's be partners.<eos> What you want to do, partner? I don't know.<eos> I thought maybe you could teach me how to move the money around.<eos> Then I could do it.<eos> How did you set this all up?<eos> Tasha did all that for me.
But we'll figure this out together, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> But together.<eos> Together.<eos> I was thinking about something.<eos> If I had found the location on Lobos, you had a plan in place?<eos> I did.<eos> That's a loose end.<eos> He doesn't know who I am.<eos> He never did.
The show's not changing.<eos> That guy doesn't know anything.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be fine, everybody.<eos> Uh, come on, Piggy.<eos> Let's go call my friends who worked with this guy.<eos> Well, this bird will never tweet.<eos> Tweets are to signal danger - or request nourishment from mother bird.<eos> - Mm. Call home! Pache?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he d... he did some work on the show.
All right, everybody.<eos> Let's get to work!<eos> - You want us... you want us in there?<eos> - Yep? Want us in there?<eos> 'Cause we'd be more than happy to... contribute.<eos> - Kermit! - Huh? - Oh!<eos> - Denise!<eos> Uh... oh, no.<eos> I missed your 5k run!<eos> - No, no, yes, you did!
Huh?<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Uh, everybody?<eos> I just got off the phone with the network, and they loved our new take on the show!<eos> Hey, what do you know about that?<eos> ! Cheers, mon capitán!<eos> I think we'd all like to see more of you on the show.<eos> - Aw. - And the rest of you, too.<eos> If I knew your names, I'd praise you all individually.<eos> But since I don't, cheers!
- Mm. But as a network president, I have to slap that pig down.<eos> - What?<eos> - Told him that, too.<eos> - Well... - Look, a pig tail is short<eos> - and curly and ick. - Well, I d...<eos> Plus, if she shows it, it will open the floodgates.<eos> I mean, for years, George Stephanopoulos has lobbied to wear a crop top.<eos> Do you want to see Greek belly?<eos> - Well, if George feels more comf...<eos> - No, you do not!
- And they are. When this device detonates, it will collapse the event horizon on this side of the breach, thereby shutting off any connection to Earth-2 permanently.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm just a little tired. I don't feel like myself.<eos> I'm good though.<eos> Yeah. - It's gonna work, Harry.<eos> - Yep, yep.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it!
_<eos> No, no!<eos> Halt.<eos> You don't get to do this.<eos> You don't get to turn away.<eos> You want to make the tough decisions, then you have to know what it costs.<eos> - You're gonna have to live with this.<eos> - Please, don't do this.<eos> Please, I am begging you.<eos> Please, don't do this.
I'm sorry, I didn't think you'd be home.<eos> I took the day off, if you must know. Which you mustn't.<eos> You should have told me you were coming so I could have told you not to.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> What were you gonna do with that?<eos> Bludgeon.<eos> I thought it was a break-in.<eos> I did tell you I was coming.<eos> Didn't you get my messages?<eos> Yes, Sol. I did.
I like whiskey.<eos> Sheriff, they want a picture with you.<eos> Oh, okay. All right.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay, big shot.<eos> Norma Bates?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
400 to 1, huh?<eos> Is that an official comment?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna walk outta here and try to do my civic and moral duty to help...<eos> - Your moral duty?<eos> - To help the people on the inside!<eos> - You actually believe...<eos> - I expect you to do the same!<eos> - Do you believe in the cordon?<eos> - I do.
- No?<eos> You have something good... and beautiful hidden inside of you.<eos> Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me.<eos> We're perfect for each other.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
You were 8.<eos> You told me she was stuck in Cuba.<eos> I said, "She sent me over on a life raft<eos> "but got caught before she could climb in behind me."<eos> And as soon as she could escape, she'd be coming for you.<eos> I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
If you want to know what Xander's been up to, log on to the drone footage at sunset.<eos> Maybe you'll rethink which side of this you want to be on.<eos> Wait. Ha ha!<eos> How does this even grab on?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> That is pure class right there.<eos> Oh. This is... this is very much me.<eos> Now you have to take up ceramics.<eos> You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?
You saw him, right?<eos> Yeah, when he came to pick up the payment, which now belongs to the Houston PD.<eos> I got to... cover that now.<eos> We can't miss that drop tomorrow.<eos> You guys know the runner?<eos> The air marshal? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tagged along with Darryl a few times.<eos> You go in his place,<eos> - take Eddie with you. - T... what about who killed Darryl?<eos> I thought we took care of that with the, uh, Dooley hit in the jailhouse.<eos> Yeah, so did I, Eddie.
I'm just trying to help.<eos> Okay, Liz, you want to help?<eos> Then you find out who killed my client in jail and get your damn car out of my driveway, please.<eos> So, how you holding up?<eos> Must have been pretty tough yesterday.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> This Jackson guy.<eos> He wasn't at our wedding, never even heard his name before last week, and then, all of a sudden, he's Boots' lawyer?<eos> How do you guys all know him so well?<eos> We don't really.
You accept hundreds?<eos> You don't look like the trust fund kids I normally work with.<eos> Are you a rapper?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> They call me White Chocolate.<eos> Well, you would need a parent to co-sign.<eos> Even then I'm afraid that you would never make board approval.<eos> What, black folk money ain't no good here?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Nah, you don't.
What do you think?<eos> People say hands are the hardest thing to draw, but I think it's tits.<eos> How the fuck could you send out that picture of Helene?<eos> I just saw your phone there and the idea popped into my head like divine intervention.<eos> You know, my therapist says that revenge doesn't give you any real satisfaction, but clearly she's an idiot because this feels really, really good.<eos> Amanda, it's all over the goddamn school.<eos> Yeah, social media's fast, huh?<eos> You shouldn't have screwed me over.<eos> I never made any fucking promises to you!<eos> Yes, you fucking well did!
Today, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> I can't do it to Elaine.<eos> Oh, Grace.<eos> You know... when I went back to Robert after you... I just shut down.<eos> After he left, I tried dating someone, but... he wasn't you.<eos> God, I wish things were different.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Who the hell is that?<eos> I'm trying to tell you that Kenny Loggins never bought your painting.<eos> I made the whole thing up.<eos> What?<eos> You were having such a hard time with your art.<eos> Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
I never understood our marriage until right now.<eos> For God sakes, Grace, we're divorced.<eos> Aren't we past this?<eos> -Well, I'm not.<eos> -Where is this coming from?<eos> I am still being treated the way I was for 40 years, and I am not gonna settle for it anymore.<eos> Neither am I. I've got a belly full of rage and martini.<eos> Sol lied to me about Kenny Loggins.<eos> He never bought my painting.<eos> Yes! Yes, he did.
What's the matter, - Bobby?<eos> Not happy to see me? - I told you I'm sorry.<eos> I know, I know, I know, I know, you're sorry.<eos> So you feel better now you cleared your conscience?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> ! I want the truth, Bobby!<eos> All of it!<eos> I told you everything on the tape yesterday.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, you didn't.
No, they just kept coming.<eos> First time, these guys cornered me in my bunk and I was just defending myself.<eos> Second time, they tried stealing my chits and I fought back and boom, I got four weeks for that, so then I-I was done.<eos> That's it... then I just...<eos> What?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, the third and fourth times I started the fight.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do, Troy.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. OK.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> We got to go.<eos> I have a briefing.<eos> For what?<eos> Some Health Department thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> _<eos> How you doing, Lex?
- When this is all over...<eos> - It's been two days.<eos> What?<eos> She hasn't been out in two days.<eos> Well, with this heat, could you blame her?<eos> Just because you haven't seen her, that doesn't mean...<eos> You know exactly what that means.<eos> I know you're probably gonna tell me that me being up here, being able to look in, has absolutely no effect on whether she's still alive.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
I don't know how she is, actually.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Make sure she stays strong for the baby.<eos> I got kids, too.<eos> Outside.<eos> Come on, let me in!<eos> That one's 65 seconds, which is good.<eos> When contractions are longer than a minute, it means you're getting close. Okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Uh, I-I don't.
You can lie.<eos> You can lie. - All right.<eos> - Just go.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> No, not again.<eos> - Hey, is she...?<eos> - Yes. - Right now?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Just tell me they train cops to...<eos> - Yes, they do.
All right, so we continue on.<eos> _<eos> Lex Carnahan, I never expected to see you under investigation.<eos> And yet you called me in.<eos> I don't remember getting your name.<eos> And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes. Yes, they do.
Kate always gave me a hard time when I thought about giving up.<eos> She always saw me as... more of hero than I saw myself.<eos> She had a way of seeing the good in people.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We're gonna figure out a way to fix this mistake.<eos> This wasn't a mistake.<eos> You're sitting there acting like you don't know who this was.<eos> It was Darryl.<eos> I saw him in the street, and I recognized him, and I just...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just snapped.<eos> And I'm not sorry about it, either.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, he had it coming.<eos> They all do.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.<eos> You could be relocated before it's ready.<eos> But if it works, we can get everybody out.<eos> Two hundred of you, running around the forest?<eos> No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?<eos> You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
Aurora has the keys.<eos> Good.<eos> Gun.<eos> - Why would I give you a gun?<eos> - You need help.<eos> I can help. (scoffing)<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, assuming we can get him face to face, why doesn't he just arrest us?<eos> Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos<eos> - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
Vulnerable.<eos> Good.<eos> That's the man we have to target.<eos> We've got to find the scrap of a soul that's left in there after everything he's done.<eos> What else?<eos> He loved his child.<eos> He loves his wife.<eos> Sabine once told me she thinks the only reason he joined the party was to make a good impression on her father.<eos> Good. That's good,<eos> - if he did it for her.
He said he was scared.<eos> Let's just bury our dead.<eos> You must think I'm a monster.<eos> You're not a monster.<eos> Doing that to our own son...<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no. Sabine,<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
My gardener?<eos> Forgive me, ma'am.<eos> I am a thief, but I am also the principal agent in the jewels' return.<eos> - Hang him! - I could double your money for you.<eos> - Hang him now!<eos> - Double your money.<eos> Surely if he could accomplish that, ma'am.<eos> Don't trust him, every breath is a lie.<eos> He must have the money he made from the sales.<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
Shut up!<eos> No!<eos> Stop it.<eos> - We can be together.<eos> - Never.<eos> Listen to yourself, Mary Ann.<eos> You're wishing a woman who's done no wrong into the next world.<eos> But you don't love her<eos> - or why are you here?<eos> - Don't!
Stop!<eos> What's the meaning of this?<eos> We have orders to stay these executions and take charge of the prisoners.<eos> Take charge and let them live?<eos> They want to release the murderous Spanish scum.<eos> What are you doing, Marcheaux?<eos> Let's see who the orders are from?<eos> No royal assent?<eos> Minister Treville needs no royal assent.<eos> Yes, he does.
I... Why... why would you want to do something like this?<eos> - That's not like you. - I know.<eos> It's not.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I mean, I've been with Brian for 10 years.<eos> I mean, I don't even know what "like me" means anymore.<eos> Well, having an affair a month before your wedding seems like a really weird way to figure it out.<eos> It's not an affair.<eos> I've been with. - Do you not want to get married?<eos> - Of course I do.
That's harsh.<eos> Yeah, that... that sounds harsh.<eos> Were you the one who leaked them?<eos> That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
Everything she said is a lie.<eos> She makes it seem like I tricked Spence into loving me.<eos> But why else would he leave her?<eos> She's America's Sweetheart, and you're... you.<eos> It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> They're getting remarried, and Spence still doesn't even remember me.<eos> Rosie, may I give you some advice?<eos> Stop whining.<eos> I don't whine.<eos> Yes, you do.
Honestly, I think she'd be fine with it, but Kyle asked me not to tell her.<eos> Maybe she can find out by accident.<eos> You know, that's not the worst idea.<eos> I always like it when I don't have the worst idea.<eos> Here's a decaf, triple-shot, skinny latte for Carmen and whatever these are for you guys.<eos> Mmm! They always get my order wrong.<eos> What is so hard about black?<eos> Why do we even come to this place?<eos> Because that barista thinks I'm hot, and I never have to pay for my drinks.<eos> But we do.
You need to find out who really killed Peri.<eos> I killed Peri.<eos> Ben is washing Spence's brain.<eos> That's why he confessed.<eos> She's not asking questions about Spence?<eos> She doesn't have a clue.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Circle?<eos> The Circle?<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
So, you're really just a nice guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Boy, you're all worked up about this, aren't you?<eos> No, no. No sexy hand massage.<eos> Doug, this has been fun.<eos> The sex was surprisingly great, and my hands have never been more relaxed.<eos> But I don't have feelings for you.<eos> It was just a fling.<eos> I don't mean anything to you?<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Come on, man.<eos> I already started building the set, and you're a bona fide movie star.<eos> Mostly just TV and one really well-reviewed indie. Can we talk about this later?<eos> Miguel's been getting into trouble at school, and I'm trying to knock some sense into him.<eos> Ah, a little scared-straight action, huh?<eos> Got it.<eos> What you got there, kid? Gummy bears.<eos> You brought gummy bears into my house?<eos> Want one?<eos> I do kind of.
Frances!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> [Chuckles nervously] I found this sexy maid costume from Halloween.<eos> I thought I'd come by and surprise you.<eos> I didn't realize you'd be together.<eos> I am so embarrassed. [Chuckles]<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
- You do? - Yes.<eos> Oh!<eos> Just because I live here, I can't take you for granted.<eos> That's not exactly what I meant. No.<eos> You deserve romance.<eos> I got to step up my game.<eos> Dinners, bubble baths, flowers...<eos> whatever it takes to make you happy.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh. Figured it was the universe giving me a kick in the pants.<eos> What?<eos> I've been acting like a big baby.<eos> But I was hurt.<eos> See, when I was in New York, I bought a ring.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> And then I came back and found out that you didn't feel the same way.<eos> But I did.<eos> I do.
You happy with her?<eos> Sometimes I am.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Just see how it goes.<eos> Give it some time.<eos> You going to be all right tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gemma is coming round with Keira.<eos> I don't really want to be alone.<eos> Who does, Agatha?
Want to hang out later?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I... I would like that.<eos> Okay.<eos> And look at that.<eos> I thought this was going to be hard, but it turns out ning up a date is easy.<eos> Don't I need your number or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, yeah, definitely you do.
Thank you, Mrs Hedley.<eos> You be a good lad for your mam now.<eos> So Tommy Riley will sell me to the workhouse for the sin of losing my husband. Don't be daft.<eos> You're not going to the workhouse.<eos> You're just asking him for help you're entitled to.<eos> Taking poor relief off the Board of Guardians is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> You don't believe that, and neither do I.<eos> Oh, I don't know why you have to be so proud.<eos> You didn't wish the poor man dead.<eos> No, I didn't.
Said we wake any more ghosts from Quitman, it all comes out.<eos> So that's it.<eos> We're out.<eos> We're done. We ain't letting you go down for murder.<eos> Nothing's worth any of us gettin' locked up again.<eos> You telling me you've been hauling this secret around for 18 years?<eos> Never said anything to anybody?<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't believe me, Gil?<eos> No, I do.
Hell, Willie Nelson's the one that messed up Roy Orbison's eyes, threw cocaine right in them.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> - Martha, shh.<eos> - That's how a dirty fighter does it.<eos> They throw cocaine in your eyes.<eos> Poor Roy.<eos> God.<eos> Now don't you worry about Roy Orbison.<eos> Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.
- Martha, shh.<eos> - That's how a dirty fighter does it.<eos> They throw cocaine in your eyes.<eos> Poor Roy.<eos> God.<eos> Now don't you worry about Roy Orbison.<eos> Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.<eos> - He got his, didn't he?<eos> - He did.
- That's how a dirty fighter does it.<eos> They throw cocaine in your eyes.<eos> Poor Roy.<eos> God.<eos> Now don't you worry about Roy Orbison.<eos> Roy got his own.<eos> - He did.<eos> - He got his, didn't he?<eos> - He did.<eos> - Yes, he did.
Thank you, Theo.<eos> Theo.<eos> I've finished my first major work.<eos> Excellent!<eos> Is it a work of genius?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - Who wants to hear my writing?<eos> - No, too rude.<eos> - I'd rather die.<eos> - Good, Theo does.
No, you've got me there.<eos> No.<eos> What is homosexuality?<eos> Where have you been all your life?<eos> - Outside, mainly, shooting.<eos> - Is it sex in a home?<eos> - No.<eos> - I give up, then.<eos> - I think I might know.<eos> - Of course you do.
Four times?<eos> - That's as...<eos> - Fast as Zoom.<eos> Well, faster actually.<eos> Hey... do we think that... we can get this thing smaller?<eos> If it sucks, then, yeah.<eos> All right, so now all we have to do is figure out how to get back to Zoom.<eos> Yes... just a minor issue.<eos> We closed all the breaches and have no idea how to reopen them.<eos> We don't... Wells?
We could weaponize the goggles...<eos> Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.<eos> Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle to emit a low-level EMF?<eos> We don't have the equipment to modify the pulse rifles now.<eos> Then we do another snatch and grab mission.<eos> By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute!<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but...<eos> I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
Whatever one sees, they all see.<eos> Whatever one hears, they all hear.<eos> I get it.<eos> So when do we leave?<eos> Knockout gas, Mount Weather's finest.<eos> As soon as they bring Ontari out, we put them to sleep.<eos> Nice.<eos> Because she's chipped, you'll have to EMP her like you did me before you give her the Flame.<eos> I thought Jaha destroyed all the wristbands.<eos> So did he.
I'm so sorry I left you.<eos> I had to run after him.<eos> - Rile's waiting outside.<eos> - Why?<eos> I need to end this.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> I shouldn't have put you in this position.<eos> I wanted it.<eos> I still do.
I want you to understand that, okay?<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> Is Momma going to be like that?<eos> Maybe that would be okay.<eos> No, baby.<eos> She's not ever gonna hurt us again, okay?<eos> She loves both of us more than anything.<eos> Why don't you go put them pretty flowers in a vase for your grandma?<eos> Then we can give her a funny hairdo.<eos> What do I do with these?
I got to get back to the station.<eos> You okay?<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, you were the first person I saved after I got my powers?<eos> We were out on a walk and we were talking about Eddie and how you were with him, and I was thinking to myself how I missed a lot while I was in that coma.<eos> And then all of a sudden, those cars came at us.<eos> And it was like the world froze.<eos> Like... you and I were the only two people in the world.<eos> I didn't even know what I could do yet, but I knew that I could save you.<eos> And I did.
But I was drugged by someone and I remember who that is now.<eos> It was Philip Jessup.<eos> Please strike what my client just said and let the record note that she was not under oath for any of that.<eos> This has been an inadmissible statement.<eos> Your honor, I demand that we recess so that I can properly confer with my client, who is... Clearly she is mentally incompetent right now.<eos> The D.A. is going to offer Catherine a deal.<eos> Five years, minimum security if she testifies against Philip.<eos> Okay. Please, Annalise... No.<eos> It's not your job to worry about me.<eos> Yeah, I do, though.
You know, for you.<eos> Well, do it somewhere else.<eos> I want my house back.<eos> You still want to pretend like everything's fine?<eos> Empathy doesn't even cover it. This mother's a miracle.<eos> I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.
- He's got nothing.<eos> Hey, BonBon.<eos> - This isn't right. - What isn't?<eos> Everyone taking the heat for this when I'm the one that started it all.<eos> You want to take the rap, relax. You'll get plenty of chances.<eos> - Frank... - Dude's not wrong.<eos> We wouldn't be here if not for his lead foot.<eos> Wow. Thanks for the support, Beard-o.<eos> - Asher didn't start this.<eos> - Yeah... I did.
We'll see each other again.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, Oliver's gone rogue.<eos> He's hacking the po-po for A.K.'s warrant.<eos> Oh. Good.<eos> Could've told me that downstairs. Yeah, I-I know.<eos> I just thought maybe we should talk about... you know.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.
Only thinking about yourself, worrying about what you want.<eos> Hey, I'm paging my baby sister to the dance floor right now!<eos> Come on, Annalise, what's up?<eos> You too sedated to pop that thing?<eos> You got to pop it!<eos> Pop, pop! Come on, now.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
I dunno, Dad. You know.<eos> I haven't found the right woman.<eos> Rocco.<eos> Rocco.<eos> DOG BARKS Oh, thank God.<eos> Hey, where have you been?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Daddy.<eos> He was stuck in the pond at the edge of the cricket pitch, so I hauled him out.<eos> And how did you...?
They were putting it on ice.<eos> You love it, don't you?<eos> The roll of the dice.<eos> The highs are great, but the lows...<eos> Sometimes I think it's only the pain of the lows that lets me actually feel something.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't think I ever have.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Harry!<eos> Jimmy does.
- Yeah.<eos> - Maybe, we should move on, if we wait for the simpleton, we'll be here all night.<eos> Okay, if you understand, then explain it.<eos> It's a healing spell.<eos> I've seen that welwitsch-whatever in the infirmary.<eos> Actually, trick question.<eos> It's a welwitschia mirabilis, the leaves are used for both, healing spells and for doing exotic curses.<eos> I thought it was a fern.<eos> Which is why I brought flash cards.<eos> Of course you did.
Livable weather, edible food, cable TV, but you know what it did have?<eos> Windows.<eos> So if you don't know and saw your little... little extracurricular activities, you'd be very mistaken foxes.<eos> I was above average for a fox.<eos> Okay, I've studied enough for one day.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> It ain't my fault, or my problem.<eos> For the record, you do see that you're doing wrong, though?<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> But if I hypothetically did...
Someplace with money?<eos> Well, um, we did have money.<eos> Until grandmama gambled it all away and now, all we have is titles.<eos> Sorry. Um, that was a joke.<eos> I was... born in Indiana... on a farm.<eos> My parents are farmers.<eos> Indiana?<eos> I...<eos> I thought you...<eos> Of course you did.
I just missed my plane for you.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Sit down.<eos> God.<eos> I'm sorry you missed your plane.<eos> You like your new job?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah?<eos> It's good to be away, I bet, huh?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No, I don't.
"I'm thinking about coming to Portland..."<eos> My God, I don't want to deal with this!<eos> Hang on a second. This guy is obviously contacting you for a reason.<eos> Don't you think we got to figure out why?<eos> I mean, he just said he's thinking of coming to Portland.<eos> What does this guy want from you?<eos> After all this time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He thinks we had a relationship.<eos> We didn't.
That's a nightmare.<eos> Mother?<eos> Why do you hate me?<eos> I hate you because when I look into your eyes, I see the woman I used to be, before magic, before the coven, when I was nothing but Rowena, the Tanner's daughter.<eos> A pale, scared, little girl who smelled of filth and death.<eos> I hate you...<eos> Because when you were born, your father said he loved me.<eos> Then he went back to his grand wife and his grand house whilst I lay pathetic and half-dead on a straw mat, my thighs slick with blood.<eos> I hate you...<eos> Because if I didn't...
You know what?<eos> Hey, how about this? how about this?<eos> You head out to the car, and I'm gonna bring this stuff out to you.<eos> Oh, I still got to pay for it, so...<eos> - It's on me.<eos> - What?<eos> I would like to pay for this... all of it.<eos> What, you mean you want to, like, invest?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Ungrateful child.<eos> You could have been immortal, like me.<eos> Give up.<eos> You're too weak to stop me, Raven.<eos> You always have been.<eos> Just like your mother.<eos> No, my only weakness was loving you, hoping I'd be loved in return.<eos> But all you were capable of giving is pain, so I ran away and found friends,<eos> friends I would give my life for, friends who give me love<eos> and the strength to do this.
It's 3:00 a.m.<eos> I know this is a lot to handle.<eos> Barry, come to bed.<eos> We can talk about it.<eos> You know who I wish was here right now?<eos> My mother.<eos> She's the one in my head.<eos> She always wanted this for me.<eos> And I broke her heart because I didn't.<eos> I still don't.
What about your image?<eos> I want it off those fucking trucks and billboards.<eos> Okay, I... all right, you know what, I do not have time for this drama today.<eos> You sold me out!<eos> You sold yourself out.<eos> You wanted this.<eos> You signed with us.<eos> You wanted this.<eos> - No, I never agreed to...<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
Dr. Death's with them now.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It was a Hack.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Well, it couldn't have been a Quantum.<eos> He had some kind of tech.<eos> Maybe he's a shape shifter.<eos> It looked like Laser, but it wasn't him.<eos> Yeah, we don't know that.<eos> I do.
Great. Well, it's better than Grace Rose exposing you, which is exactly what's gonna happen if you go back now.<eos> So we stay here and do nothing?<eos> You know, hope everything just goes away, hope magically we get our lives back?<eos> We're never gonna get our lives back, Vincent, don't you see that?<eos> Whatever we had, whatever we thought we could get back, it's gone.<eos> Who are we even kidding?<eos> Even if all of this goes perfectly-- we find the beast buyer, you get exonerated,<eos> Grace Rose goes away-- we can't get back what we had.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. Yes, I do.
You don't think I could find out your son was murdered just about the time you came calling me for help.<eos> I can't believe you actually lying, to me of all people.<eos> You ain't black no more.<eos> You blue. Which is why I can help.<eos> I got access to every fucking thing.<eos> Motherfucker, I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> My son's a greater danger to himself than you know.<eos> - I'm on a rescue mission.<eos> - Who are you trying to rescue?<eos> Ross Edwards.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
I'm not trying to outrun you, I'm trying to get away from you.<eos> [Laughs] Always with a comeback.<eos> Speaking of comebacks...<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Someone's in a good mood.<eos> Well, she likes peeing in cups.<eos> - She's into that kind of thing. - [Laughs]<eos> No.<eos> I got a letter this morning from you-know-who.<eos> Oh, my God, you did?
And with Ryan and your sister breathing down my neck, I can't find out on my own.<eos> Raina: I can't leave now.<eos> It took them so long to take me back.<eos> If I tell them I'm leaving again...<eos> Alex: Raina.<eos> Simon's life is in real danger.<eos> His life is his own.<eos> And even if I wanted to help you, I don't know what I can do.<eos> I don't have security clearance.<eos> No, but your sister does.
My advisor was a retired federal judge...<eos> Alan Handler.<eos> A real liberal lion.<eos> He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.<eos> Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff.<eos> But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
Can you talk later in person, maybe after you meet with Morgan?<eos> Yeah, but at the café in case you're right and they're watching me.<eos> All right.<eos> Are JT and Heather okay?<eos> Yeah, they're fine, and don't worry.<eos> They didn't say anything.<eos> Well, they don't know anything.<eos> Well, they know about beasts, so...<eos> But DHS doesn't.<eos> Only Hill did.
Ah, sounds like Tess.<eos> I thought JT was gonna punch me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And Heather, with her one good arm.<eos> It's a lot to give up, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> More than we ever wanted to.<eos> But, you know, I still believe it's gonna work out.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Fucking batshit.<eos> Who, then?<eos> Who did Retro Girl?<eos> Besides you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe half the Hero League for all I know.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Remember the question?<eos> ! I had no idea that shit was gonna go down!<eos> I didn't.
Are you rolling?<eos> I'm not getting any closer.<eos> But we need to get this. Yeah.<eos> You get it.<eos> No!<eos> I'm the fuck out.<eos> I was able to track the MAC address to a laptop purchased eight months ago in Santa Monica.<eos> Do you have a buyer?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.
Is Vincent all right?<eos> - I don't know, um...<eos> Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Uh, hi, how's it going?<eos> JT.<eos> Kyle.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No, uh, I, uh, need your help.<eos> Uh, actually, uh, Cat does.
Happened today, time-stamped an hour ago.<eos> Look, I-I don't really care about Erik Lee, but I do care about Keller.<eos> You got any idea what the connection is?<eos> No.<eos> No? L-Lee was your case, wasn't he?<eos> Yours and Chandler's?<eos> Yes, we busted him.<eos> He's out on bail, but he's about to go to trial.<eos> Yeah, only if you still have the evidence against him.<eos> Do you?
You've got to tell him stuff, Frances. You have got to make sure he knows stuff.<eos> If you don't, nobody else will. - I can't. - I will.<eos> Obviously, I will eventually...<eos> And all the other stuff, all the lies I got convicted over.<eos> I did not rape Ann Gallagher.<eos> That were Lewis.<eos> It were me that used to bring her Mars bars and let her use t'bucket.<eos> I did not kill that little police girl up on t'moor either. That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife! - I know. - But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
You will get caught, you know, Daryl.<eos> And who's going to pay for that getting fixed?<eos> It's reight, it still goes.<eos> It won't pass its MOT, love, not like that.<eos> And what if you'd hit someone?<eos> - What've you got for me?<eos> - I think you'll be pleased.<eos> I didn't, and I told you I wouldn't, do anything illegal.<eos> You're not going to tell me you didn't do owt.<eos> I did do something.
It's a shame.<eos> And now you've issued death warrants for the four of us.<eos> Go tell your Taliban... Tell us the place and time.<eos> This Sikhni will be there!<eos> All you know is to stab in the back.<eos> But we Indians never learned to turn our backs!<eos> I am right here.<eos> If you have the courage, then shoot me now.<eos> Do you have the courage?<eos> Do you?
We said things...<eos> Felt things...<eos> Was that me?<eos> Was it... was it you?<eos> Was it... was it even real?<eos> This is real, Clary.<eos> This is you... and me.<eos> Here and now.<eos> But why would Valentine tell a prisoner what he was planning to do?<eos> He didn't.
Did you have better luck?<eos> If anything, I've made it worse.<eos> What did you hope to achieve?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anything!<eos> Verity, I lost my child.<eos> How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?<eos> Ask me, Enys.<eos> Am I cleaning it to put away or do I intend to use it again?<eos> Do you?
Tell her to let go of this feud.<eos> She doesn't need to let it go. She needs to finish it.<eos> If Regina won't be happy until she crushes Snow White's heart, then we must help her do just that.<eos> This was a terrible idea.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> To talk to Snow White.<eos> Goodbye, Cora.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> No.<eos> But Regina does.
Maybe children are the line hitmen won't cross?<eos> The chemist and the sniper both performed jobs that involved families.<eos> Theoretically, if the price is high enough, a hitman shouldn't have morals.<eos> I think these kills are personal to her.<eos> Personal enough to risk double-crossing her contract.<eos> Maybe something similar happened to her.<eos> And that's how we get her to come to the table.<eos> I pretend to be that kind of client.<eos> How do we know that's gonna work?<eos> We don't.
You can go now.<eos> That's it?<eos> You already did what we needed.<eos> We?<eos> You're helping her? You're the easiest way to get to Stefan.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
You really weren't, hon.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> I unpicked your ward.<eos> I would go with Koyosegi next time.<eos> Thank you for the advice.<eos> Now, can you please leave?<eos> We already agreed that we're not partners, okay?<eos> Well, it didn't work.<eos> Because you need ten extra digits.<eos> Actually, I don't.
I don't know.<eos> Titanium alloy, custom-made.<eos> That's right, Keller, we know all about you.<eos> We know all about the super soldier program.<eos> So no matter how much they juiced you up, you're never breaking out of those.<eos> All right.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> I can't ask you to do this.<eos> Well, you didn't.
She's dead.<eos> Well, yeah. What'd you expect?<eos> She's a vampire.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.<eos> We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?
She's a vampire.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.<eos> We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
- Dr. Grey.<eos> - And Trauma 3.<eos> Dr. Hunt.<eos> Both urgent, not critical.<eos> Do want Hunt first or Grey?<eos> - Dr. Grey told me to come find you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Meredith actually asked for me, or did she just want Neuro in general?<eos> I... I don't remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Who was that guy?<eos> He seemed to know you.<eos> Did he? I don't know. I've never seen him before in my life.<eos> What, are you jealous?<eos> No, I'm upset, all right?<eos> I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
Don't you see?<eos> I may come and go as I please.<eos> Our chancellor.<eos> Our emperor.<eos> Do you feel no shame?<eos> Do you find no tragedy in their deaths?<eos> I find any loss of life tragic.<eos> Including my own, the day you died.<eos> You asked if I see in you the man I loved.<eos> I do not.
In China.<eos> A place I knew his supporters would not travel to.<eos> I took the throne from under him.<eos> They say I cheated.<eos> I don't think it's wholly the election Kaidu's after, but humiliation.<eos> He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
But was Ana ever a cross-dressing cruise ship director?<eos> [both gasp] Does this mean the stalker is...<eos> Kelly, what are you doing here?<eos> I heard you were looking for Javi.<eos> Well, I found him.<eos> [grunting] Yes, bound and gagged.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you find him like that? Or did you do that to him?<eos> Oh, no, my bad. Yeah, I totally did that to him.
It seems you have already decided what she is.<eos> It's the money, isn't it?<eos> You thought, "Here's some poor rich woman I can play."<eos> You leap to so many conclusions, it would be dishonourable<eos> - for me to contradict you. - Because you cannot contradict me.<eos> - You are a fraud.<eos> - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
A tiger's head - the one that mauled its keeper up at the zoo.<eos> I shall restore its majesty.<eos> Ugh! Don't hold your breath, sir.<eos> You get a feeling for your beasts, Mr Venus?<eos> I do, Inspector.<eos> The bird's flight, the hare's dash, the leap of the salmon before the trap, the poison, the gun, the gaff.<eos> I get a feeling for their freedom afore it's robbed.<eos> And breathe.<eos> Animals don't lie, I suppose.<eos> Oh, they do.
Yes, Ross.<eos> Yes, Ross.<eos> I know that you don't want it and I know it's just another burden to you, but there's no preventing it now, so all we can do is...<eos> How long have you known?<eos> Since the trial.<eos> Good God!<eos> And not to tell me.<eos> You said you didn't want another, not after Julia.<eos> Nor did I.<eos> Nor do I.
I could jump out of the way.<eos> __<eos> Not bad.<eos> But what if the bullet just grazes me?<eos> __<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'll do.<eos> They need you upstairs right now.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> Of course I did.
I don't have a lot of time.<eos> Here's the deal, Mr. Matthews.<eos> You are the CEO of CaroBank, and I happen to have a unique problem that involves one of your branches.<eos> Just take whatever you want.<eos> I'm not gonna rob you, man.<eos> I just need access to the Midtown branch before banking hours so I can open a safe deposit box using this perfectly legitimate key.<eos> Like I said, I'm not gonna take anything,<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone, but if I don't get what I want, well, I did peruse your personal computer over there, and you, Mr. Matthews, have a penchant for high-priced escorts.<eos> A lot of 'em.<eos> Hi. How you doing, ma'ams?
So, thanks for that.<eos> Things may get a little crazy for a while.<eos> I know I haven't given back as much as you've given me.<eos> There's probably no way I ever could.<eos> But starting now, I'm going to try.<eos> And in order to try, I've got to do a few things.<eos> So you may not hear from me for a minute.<eos> I think I have a way to make some of this okay.<eos> And if it all works out, I'll see you in a few days.<eos> And if it doesn't?
You can understand how this doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mr. Finch, are you formally acting as Rachel's legal counsel?<eos> Because I'm not here to interrogate anyone.<eos> I'm simply trying to get to the bottom of what happened in that apartment.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly... I'm pissed.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
No.<eos> I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly... I'm pissed.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> The last time I saw you here, you were standing just about where you're standing now and you called my son a murderer.<eos> He did save your life, Dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
Never on purpose, though.<eos> I tried to protect you.<eos> Go on.<eos> I went to Russia to help Piper.<eos> She knows how to make the immunity shot now, but Sands has her.<eos> He's teamed up with a group of people that used to work with Morra.<eos> And now they're creating some kind of Legion of Doom.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Did you say "Legion of Doom?"<eos> I did.
If they're wrong, then, The Executioner's still out there.<eos> You would not recognize Gail if you passed her on the street.<eos> Big as a house.<eos> A retired teacher, never married.<eos> Well, guess she loved food too much to ever let a man in her life. Wow.<eos> Who's next?<eos> What about that boy that you had a crush on in Bio?<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why The Executioner's targeting us.<eos> Because...<eos> It's my fault.<eos> You know, I gave up.<eos> I tried to kill myself and that's... a sin. No...<eos> Baby.<eos> It's true, though.<eos> I destroy everything.<eos> No...<eos> No, you don't.
- Moving on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tom Winston.<eos> Well, he's crazy enough, but he's behind bars.<eos> So what?<eos> Serial killers have groupies.<eos> What if Tom is the brains, and he's got someone on the outside being the brawn?<eos> Yeah, but he doesn't see anyone.<eos> I mean, except for me.<eos> Yes, he does.
- Of course, Mr Crabb.<eos> - Madame Rennard, can you sign these order sheets?<eos> I'm concerned about all these additional machinists.<eos> I'm concerned about feeding customer demand.<eos> - You missed one.<eos> - Did you speak to the press?<eos> - Oh, will you all just go away? - (SHOCKED GASPS)<eos> That was unforgiveable, Harry.<eos> I-I apologise.<eos> Don't.
I will be right back, okay?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Who died?<eos> What?<eos> The tie.<eos> I was filling in for someone.<eos> It's okay, happens to all of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does.
I didn't want any of you to visit me in there.<eos> House arrest is much more dignified.<eos> I was thinking, I'll come by every couple of days brief you, keep you in the loop.<eos> That way, when you come back to work, you can hit the ground running.<eos> The director paid me a visit yesterday.<eos> Apparently, I'm bad for optics.<eos> He suggests I stop talking about frame jobs and faked deaths and take a plea.<eos> So no one else believes that Sofia's alive?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes. I do.
I think that's great, really.<eos> Because I'm... I'm kinda interested in someone too.<eos> - Oh really?<eos> Who?<eos> - Wes. Mmm.<eos> I kind of thought that was happening.<eos> He's pretty great, huh?<eos> He's a very... interesting young man.<eos> - You don't like him. - No, no.<eos> I do. I do.
But tell her about the recovery time.<eos> 6 to 8 weeks, barring complications.<eos> See?<eos> There's no way I can be on the shelf that long, right?<eos> Davey.<eos> Honey, this is your health, okay?<eos> I take it he has a pretty full schedule?<eos> Well, our business is day to day so you never know when it's,<eos> - you know, about to get busy.<eos> - I do.
I wanna talk to my mom.<eos> She can't talk to you right now, honey.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, she's talking to someone that might be able to help her out.<eos> You don't think my mom did any of this, d-do you?<eos> The most important thing is for you to get some rest.<eos> No. My mom didn't do anything.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just... I do.
You must hate me.<eos> I've tried forgetting'.<eos> Maybe I should try forgiving.<eos> - Come here, old friend.<eos> - Hey, good to see you too, bro.<eos> Now let's get out of here, huh?<eos> Listen, Uncle Ford, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> Remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew Bill's weakness?<eos> - Yeah, a secret way to defeat him?<eos> - I... I do!
He's not coming.<eos> I'm sure he's coming, lynda.<eos> I'll try his office again.<eos> director's line.<eos> Doctor huffnagel here.<eos> I'm sorry to call again, but i'm here with lynda,<eos> And she's wondering if peter is on his way.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The director got to your office two minutes ago. No.<eos> He didn't.
But on a personal note -- please.<eos> I just wanna say, When i think of the horrifying nightmare That elizabeth keen has endured --<eos> Well, there are no words.<eos> There is no apology i can give on behalf of the government That could ever be sufficient.<eos> I only hope that she can take some solace In the knowledge that in the end, The system worked.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know who you really are, raymond.<eos> Who you are to her.<eos> And i know why you did this.<eos> Does she?
Emilio.<eos> It's official.<eos> Calavera was one of the captured.<eos> We sentenced him to the labyrinth centuries ago.<eos> Inside the temple of the eternal feast.<eos> The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.
Oh, those damn radar eyes.<eos> Do I save her 'cause I should?<eos> Or cause she's hot?<eos> Mamma.<eos> Alright, you naked assholes, time to pick on someone your own size.<eos> You want some?<eos> !<eos> You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?
Or cause she's hot?<eos> Mamma.<eos> Alright, you naked assholes, time to pick on someone your own size.<eos> You want some?<eos> !<eos> You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?<eos> You feel that?<eos> Do you?
Can I have it, please?<eos> You took notes on my wife?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Look at this shit.<eos> You got all this...<eos> Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
- Now this one.<eos> Take a good, long look.<eos> It takes a moment to see it.<eos> See what?<eos> Superman and Clark Kent are one and the same person.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I drew specs on Superman.<eos> Everyone knows they're the same person.<eos> Well, Lois Lane doesn't.
Not such a long shot after all.<eos> All right, gents, change of plans.<eos> Scott, you and I will take out the cult monkeys and surround the redhead.<eos> Professor, you create a diversion.<eos> [Amaru] On your feet.<eos> My Queen... we did not expect you.<eos> Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course we do.
Do you have, uh... (whispers) Ilhicamina?<eos> I might've caught that once in the '70s.<eos> In those days, we didn't think twice about goin' bareback, you know?<eos> (chuckles) Actually, it's been around for centuries.<eos> OK, just buy an eighth and let's get outta here, Richard.<eos> Come on. I'm sorry I don't stock your ganja, but, um...<eos> Free samples.<eos> In the back.<eos> Hmm... We love free samples.<eos> We do?
It shall be done.<eos> Time to go.<eos> - What?<eos> - Get up.<eos> This is destiny, you know.<eos> Bringing us back together.<eos> Yeah, well, destiny's about to kick our ass.<eos> Shall we dance?<eos> - We still got it.<eos> - I do.
♪ Killing all the time ♪<eos> ♪ We're the same with new intentions ♪<eos> ♪ We're the same with bad intentions ♪ [inmates shouting] ♪ Love ♪<eos> ♪ Is your gun ♪<eos> ♪ Love is your gun ♪<eos> ♪ Love is your gun ♪<eos> Mira que lindo.<eos> Who told you you could come up here... and ask for a sit-down?<eos> She cleared this, didn't she?<eos> She did.
"They are demon warriors who hunt their prey by the rhythms of their heart, reading it like a fingerprint to their souls."<eos> Oh my God, who writes this shit?<eos> We still have no idea how to kill these things.<eos> First, we gotta find 'em.<eos> If Scott leads them back to the band, I've got the license plate number to their tour bus.<eos> I can call it in.<eos> Well, what the fuck are you waitin' for?<eos> I don't think he likes taking orders from me.<eos> Little secret?<eos> Nobody does.
The Ranger was your inside man this whole time.<eos> When you took me aside in the prison, you were letting him stage the kidnapping.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Yeah, we trucked in a few other surprises, too.<eos> For now, the Ranger's gonna distract them while we get into position.<eos> Then he's gonna open the tunnel access to the church, we can ambush from the inside.<eos> That's a lot of trust to put in one man.<eos> Yep.<eos> And you still don't trust me.<eos> I do not.
Amaru did something to her.<eos> I'm gonna need you to wait here.<eos> Ah, fuck.<eos> Any sign of him?<eos> No.<eos> He could still be alive... With her.<eos> Do we really have to go through that town?<eos> The only way to get to the mine.<eos> You know, you don't have to do this alone.<eos> Yes, I do.
She'll never sign up.<eos> Well, there's only one way we're gonna find out.<eos> Unless you wanna keep mopin' around here about your ex-girlfriend.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> - Then, what is it about, Richard?<eos> The wheels are coming off the goddamn world here.<eos> We're just a couple of... punks from K.C.<eos> If we're gonna survive this, we need all the help we can get.<eos> - You're not gonna regret this.<eos> - I already do.
Russ has always had an unorthodox approach to farming.<eos> But it's served us well over the years.<eos> You know, we've been clearing six figures when everybody else around us has been closing up shop.<eos> Wow. That kind of thing's unheard of in farming.<eos> But lately, his eccentricities... they're out of control.<eos> You know, he thinks he can predict the weather by how the cows are moving.<eos> Can I see him now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Russ, how you doing?
Where's all this new blood coming from?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Wait.<eos> Stop suctioning.<eos> We got to figure out the new source.<eos> Ohh. Looks like the spleen's been punctured twice.<eos> Could that have been caused when the screw dropped when we were plating?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> The hole is way too small for the screw to have caused this kind of damage.<eos> So then what did?
You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Dawn.<eos> Don't let me die out here all by myself.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Reba, do you remember in third year when you got that really nasty eye infection and I had to read to you?<eos> You were doing that paper on "pride and prejudice: Gender and role reversal"<eos> "in 19th century literature."<eos> How did I even remember that, right?<eos> I do.
What?<eos> That thing that I think you were suggesting during our impromptu debate club this morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I, uh... I spent the day without them.<eos> And?<eos> And it didn't go off without its hiccups, but, um... I got it done.<eos> No one died.<eos> So you'll talk to Shahir?<eos> You'll book the surgery.<eos> I already did.
What about Dmitri?<eos> Is there any news? The fact that they're on the hunt for his sister means he's still alive.<eos> And if he's still alive, there's hope.<eos> One good thing about the Maria Ostrov situation is it throws a lot of cards up in the air.<eos> Dmitri could be one of 'em.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
- Good shit, fellas.<eos> Good shit, man.<eos> Hey, man, uh, what's that little spin thing you did at the end?<eos> - Frontside 180?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, that shit was fly, man. That was nice.<eos> - I worked my ass off trying... - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, man, hard work pays off, bro.<eos> - Do we know you?<eos> - Nah. But your mans do.
- I got it. - I can do it.<eos> - No, I got it, okay?<eos> You can go home.<eos> - Cisco, I said I got it. - I... I...<eos> I can do it. - Go, Cisco!<eos> Get the fuck out of my house already!<eos> I don't need your help, okay?<eos> I don't need you next to my family.<eos> I don't need you around me.<eos> I don't your fucking help, Cisco.
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> - Those bikers work for you?<eos> - Shit.<eos> Look, son, I didn't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> I just wanted my pills.<eos> So now what?<eos> You're gonna shoot me in front of all these witnesses?<eos> You're smarter than that, Cisco.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - But I do.
Of course he did.<eos> You believe him?<eos> No. Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
No. Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.<eos> Yeah. I don't know how you got through that.<eos> I didn't.
Tinned food.<eos> I ate from the can.<eos> No spoon.<eos> We had to earn the right to a spoon.<eos> I never did.<eos> Did he... ever give you... anything?<eos> So, what did you do all day?<eos> There was no light so I didn't know if it was day or night.<eos> How did you keep track, then?<eos> I didn't.
It creeps up on you.<eos> He was just nice to me.<eos> It was nice to have someone be nice.<eos> And Mum liked him, which was... Well, it made a difference.<eos> Did Dad?<eos> He didn't come into it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> Your face says it does.<eos> It really doesn't.
I've got to check that she didn't end up sleeping rough in some doorway.<eos> You're behaving like a child.<eos> What?<eos> Have you called Christina?<eos> We need to go to the station, then.<eos> I'll come and get you.<eos> Ivy's been arrested.<eos> She's not your responsibility.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you really don't.
Dylan was a 30-year-old man when he was killed.<eos> Phoebe... doesn't stand a chance.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I do, actually.<eos> Right.<eos> I believe you're in love with Ivy.<eos> Just not this version.<eos> 13-year-old Ivy.<eos> But that girl, she doesn't exist any more.<eos> She does.
Yes, well, that may be.<eos> Speaking of which, the Pretend Pretenders are playing again this weekend.<eos> Uh, much like the real band, we have been described as "meh."<eos> Still, I'm really sorry.<eos> Can you find it in yourself to forgive me, and maybe we can just go back to being friends?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.<eos> Oh, the strike ended a month ago.<eos> What? ! Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I did.
See, she was playing a character there that was...<eos> Oh, I'm not playing a character.<eos> This is me, Dina, talking to you, union buster Steve.<eos> I'm in a dark place right now, and quite frankly, I have nothing left to lose.<eos> So you will sign this card, or I will be waiting for you in the parking lot at the end of the night, where I will wrap my hands around that tiny chicken neck of yours and stare deep into your eyes while I watch the lights go out.<eos> Let's take a break.<eos> You want some of mine?<eos> - Hey. - Hey, man.<eos> Just want to let you know, I know names besides Steve.<eos> Of course you do.
I can't... look, she's all over the place.<eos> I don't even know why she let me back in the house.<eos> We barely talk, which is probably good because it's fewer chances I'll piss her off again.<eos> - That's pathetic.<eos> - What's her problem?<eos> - She's in a mood.<eos> - Still?<eos> I said to tell her that I needed a minute.<eos> - You didn't tell me that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Oh, h-honey, I...<eos> We'll need to go in a few times, but I assure you.<eos> It's the safest, best option.<eos> I figured out how to do it all on a leg and a half, and now you want to limit everything I do for my entire childhood?<eos> This is how you get. The rest of your childhood.<eos> I'm trying to save your life, Maya.<eos> Sweetheart, we should consider this.<eos> Maybe... I went to three different hospitals before I came here, and they all said the same thing.<eos> They said, "go to Grey-Sloan.<eos> Do to Dr. Karev."
I'm okay.<eos> Uh, I should...<eos> I didn't screw them up.<eos> I was nice.<eos> Penny killed my husband.<eos> I took her in, I'm teaching her.<eos> I am trying to make something good out of it.<eos> That was very cool of me.<eos> I didn't have to do that.<eos> No, you didn't, but why did you?
On site, same as you.<eos> - You're gonna place those 16 inches apart on the ground.<eos> We're gonna build a wall on the ground?<eos> That's easier. You'll see.<eos> Did you... you grow up around here?<eos> Near here.<eos> Where'd you go to high school?<eos> Jefferson for a while.<eos> What year did you graduate?<eos> I didn't.
And she doesn't know it was Joe's.<eos> So what's the question?<eos> It's customary when a number is retired for the family to rule on any request to return that number to active duty.<eos> What we should ask ourselves is:<eos> what would Joe do?<eos> That, too.<eos> First he'd ask why you didn't want it.<eos> I thought long and hard about that.<eos> And you never really said.<eos> No, I didn't.
Yes.<eos> No.<eos> You're not sure.<eos> Don't cold read me.<eos> - Where's that girl?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> We all are.<eos> I don't have anything to hide.<eos> Yes, you do.
Arthur, what you felt was real.<eos> Why did you say Adelaide would be no more by midnight?<eos> Did you really believe she was in danger?<eos> Or were you just trying to distract us?<eos> The facts might be met speciously enough.<eos> Edith... how did you know my wife's nickname?<eos> It just came to me.<eos> I saw you at the restaurant.<eos> You don't want me to see him.<eos> I don't.

Tikku!<eos> Yes, well, I have given my share of the store to my son, Jamshed.<eos> He will rebuild while you recuperate.<eos> Little Jamshed.<eos> Oh, how he's grown.<eos> Indeed, first in his class with a business degree from Wharton, and he is ready to take my place de-gunking the cheese warmer.<eos> All right, my brother.<eos> I will especially miss looking into your tired, sunken eyes during our wordless shift changes. Hm.<eos> Remember when we used to nod?<eos> I do, I do.
I'd like to get paid.<eos> In corn cob pipes, right?<eos> Because in 1967, you and...<eos> Just get going.<eos> Dad, check out this "A" I got in citizenship.<eos> Sorry, boy, late for dinner.<eos> I know exactly how you feel, Bart.<eos> This family isn't the greatest at recognizing achievement.<eos> Wow, now I understand why you're so mad all the time.<eos> I really do.
How dare you? This has nothing to do with that.<eos> You have a blind spot when it comes to him.<eos> I'm trying to protect you. Well, you're not. You're being an asshole.<eos> And for your information, keeping me from being there for my father isn't protecting me.<eos> It's pissing me the hell off.<eos> Good, Donna, you're here.<eos> Look, I need you to...<eos> The only thing I need is for you to tell me what you did, because I just found out that they're formally charging my father with bank fraud tomorrow.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What did you do?
GIBBS: How exactly did that conversation go?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You know exactly what I'm doing here. You said you would not testify.<eos> Yeah, well, that was before Anita Gibbs dragged me in and told me she was going to put me away for 10 years.<eos> I don't give a shit what she told you.<eos> You said you were going to call a lawyer. Well, before I had a chance to do that, they showed me what they had.<eos> Which is names, dates, witnesses, and everything else they need to put me away for as long as they want.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> How would they... You think I want to do this?<eos> I don't.
Your Honor.<eos> HARVEY: Let me rephrase.<eos> Is Miss Griffith going to be perjuring herself or are you?<eos> Yeah, I was jealous of him.<eos> And if he lied about all of that, what's to make us believe that he wasn't lying about everything else?<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, the prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules, but we know he does because, ladies and gentleman of the jury,<eos> Mike Ross... Is a fraud.<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike. She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
Mike...<eos> Mike...<eos> Mike. She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.<eos> Look, ever since the day I met you, you have always seen the good in people, and we only need one person on the jury to feel that way about you.<eos> - And what if they don't?
I don't have to give you anything.<eos> You're not his attorney.<eos> Mr. Diaz, my name is Mike Ross.<eos> Now, do you want me to represent you or do you want to stick with this asshole Perkins who didn't even show up to your hearing?<eos> He's my lawyer.<eos> Donna, I need your help and I need it right now.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is the jury back?<eos> No, I need to know if Stephanie Liston still works - at the U .S. Attorney's Office.<eos> - She does, why?
I'm interested in the data he's looking for, about me and my relationship with this task force.<eos> The manhunt exposed your relationship to Liz.<eos> Yes, people are talking about whether I'm cooperating with the FBI.<eos> Rumors are swirling.<eos> And whoever he is, he was sent to determine whether those rumors are true.<eos> Has our friend arrived yet?<eos> I'm excited to speak with him.<eos> I know you're there, and I know you told them about Shell Island.<eos> But since you're not me, you didn't receive an invitation, and you don't know when and where the meeting is taking place.<eos> I do.
He has me hold his phone.<eos> He says it messes up the lines in his suit.<eos> I have nothing to confess to you.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> I wasn't really interested in hearing it.<eos> Although I suppose life in the abbey must be full of intrigue.<eos> What I am interested in is a proposition.<eos> Care to hear it?<eos> You have a job for the Vehm?<eos> I do.
Josephine, no.<eos> I bought this flat four years ago.<eos> So that some day I could bring you here to the scene of your crime.<eos> Josephine Molire.<eos> Now, listen...<eos> Josephine's father was the most prolific criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe.<eos> But for all his success, he had a problem, an enemy.<eos> An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl--<eos> Yes, you did.
It really is. Um...<eos> We've got great schools, a lot of outdoor activities.<eos> Oh, there's this-- this tall ship in-- it looks like a pirate ship.<eos> It's in the harbor.<eos> Uh, we take my niece.<eos> She is obsessed with it.<eos> Can I be honest?<eos> I like you guys a lot, and you're probably too polite to ask about it, but you do know about my past?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Torch it.<eos> Call me when it's done.<eos> I want him gone.<eos> He's here for your protection.<eos> I don't want his protection any more than I want your money.<eos> The money isn't for you.<eos> It's very generous.<eos> I can appreciate that it comes from a place of concern, but it's dirty money, and I just don't want it.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> No, but your child does.
So, here's what you do.<eos> Apologize to Agent Navabi. What?<eos> Aram, we don't have time for this.<eos> We have 30 seconds.<eos> "I'm sorry" takes less than one.<eos> 28 seconds.<eos> Look, I'm not sorry for firing her.<eos> You called her the "B" word.<eos> I didn't call her a bitch.<eos> Actually, you did.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I know that I shouldn't have, but I just didn't know what to do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This was the one thing...<eos> The one thing that you couldn't do.<eos> I know.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, do you not understand?<eos> Do you not understand what this means?<eos> I do. I just...
Why were Mateo and his friends expelled?<eos> That's not your business.<eos> If it affects us, then we have a right to know.<eos> Mateo was defending us.<eos> No, he wasn't.<eos> He was defending one of us.<eos> Evy was being harassed.<eos> Mateo was protecting her.<eos> S-she doesn't deserve suspension.<eos> Those black boys do.
Right? Talking about them is hard.<eos> And you don't have hard conversations.<eos> You... you... you know, you always lead with trust and with honesty and... Oh, and that's...<eos> That's wrong, huh? - That's wrong?<eos> - And you tell your boys to be good, right?<eos> You tell them to do right.<eos> And that's always worked, you know, because... because nobody ever had to put it to the test.<eos> But... but the first chance they get to lie... To really, really lie...<eos> I mean, they could... They could have come to you. - Yeah.<eos> - But they didn't.
Okay... it's nothing...<eos> Bye.<eos> He said, he'll call when he's alone.<eos> Say, what do you do yourself?<eos> I work with this car of Majid's.<eos> His pickup.<eos> I sell clothes from the back of the pickup, at nights.<eos> And I don't come out during the day, on account of my heart.<eos> And, how come you don't have your son-in-law's number?<eos> Well, I just don't.
What happened to you?<eos> Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?<eos> See what you're doing to me and yourself?<eos> Oh, God. Thank you so much, God!<eos> God knows, on our way here I vowed to give away a hundred different charities, just to hear his voice one more time.<eos> Thank God.<eos> How many times did I tell you not to go?<eos> My dear!<eos> I don't want you to work.<eos> I don't.
You can wait.<eos> Are you thinking about coming back to Leyland? No.<eos> Everything going all right for you at Marshall?<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> It's just, I heard they were having a lot of problems at that school.<eos> Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
How are you?<eos> Are you... Are things okay in here?<eos> Taylor, I need to know that you're okay.<eos> They keep me separated.<eos> I'm okay. Can you tell me what happened?<eos> I was told I should confront things.<eos> But, um... that wasn't really working out.<eos> I was... I got in this space where I wanted to hurt myself, and then I went to this other space.<eos> Why should I be hurting me?<eos> They did this to me.

needs her... needs her to stand front and center and be a leader... nothing.<eos> You know, if there's a donor who's got money, she's right there.<eos> She can't even cry in public.<eos> Eric... my player...<eos> He never touched that kid.<eos> He never forced himself on him, and then that kid comes back and kills Wes?<eos> Yeah. Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
Those are your boys.<eos> They do as you say.<eos> Now Wes is dead.<eos> Look, if they're acting out, that has nothing to do with me.<eos> All right?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Something happens, and you never got anything to do with it!<eos> First time the police came... after the Captains' party, I could've told them about all the liquor you bought, all the drugs, all the girls you got to come around and get screwed.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Nobody did.
Nah.<eos> I ain't hitting' no retard.<eos> But she laughed at you.<eos> You're gonna let some black retard laugh at you like that, in front of all these people?<eos> Back off, man.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> I don't care whether you're interested. I'm tellin' you...<eos> I wanna see a fight.<eos> -I don't wanna fight.<eos> -I do.
Give me a reason to hold them off.<eos> You work with us, earn your freedom.<eos> Help us bring down the people who put you here.<eos> We've been watching you since you were found in Times Square, but we're missing some pieces.<eos> When did the operative known as Oscar first approach you?<eos> After Tom Carter kidnapped me.<eos> He abducted me and tortured me.<eos> Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.<eos> He showed me a video. It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.

Damn it.<eos> DUI checkpoint.<eos> We're boxed in.<eos> We're gonna have to talk our way through.<eos> Are you up for this?<eos> Cover your wound with this.<eos> We really have to do this?<eos> Work with Jane and pretend that everything is normal?<eos> No!<eos> You don't.
- Step back! - Man, help 'em out!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - I said do something!<eos> - Step back!<eos> - Do something! He's crashing.<eos> Hey, Corey, stay with me.<eos> - Step back, mind your business.<eos> - No, you step back, man.<eos> - We got you. - Help 'em out!<eos> - Do something!
Tay.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> 2113 Squad...<eos> Hey.<eos> How's everything going?<eos> Good.<eos> You can talk to me about anything.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Olive, please don't do this...<eos> Not right now.<eos> Just, please...<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's my ride.<eos> Hey, I tried you last night.<eos> I feel a little, um... Handcuffed here, because I want to be there for you. But I don't know what you're going through.<eos> Crowley thinks I know about Voight and that guy who killed Justin.<eos> Do you?
I mean, for a bunch of mud bunnies and spics.<eos> So? It's a no go?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Those hillbillies aren't trustworthy.<eos> No way are we working with them.<eos> We don't need them.<eos> Hey! We got enough people, let's do it ourselves.<eos> You want to put your ass on the line?<eos> Fine. Be my guest.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
But I hate being here.<eos> It's awful.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> It's not safe. It'll get me all...<eos> I might... You can't do that.<eos> Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> -Are you--<eos> -Shut up.<eos> You know I'm attracted to you.<eos> No, I don't.
Because he was home sleeping.<eos> With you?<eos> On the sofa.<eos> I know you have a lot on your plate right now, and you don't need...<eos> - This is John we're talking about.<eos> - My hands are tied. We're just gonna have to let it play out.<eos> The man takes a spider outside.<eos> How can he be capable...<eos> All due respect I'm not sure you know what he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but you do?
What the hell is this place?<eos> I was hoping one of you could tell me.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Ed Clark.<eos> Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
You are a woman who pays people to do your dirty work for you.<eos> You're in here.<eos> Your lawyer's out there.<eos> You could have easily had him lure Jon to the lab.<eos> You don't actually believe I was afraid of this twit?<eos> - Have you met me? - Jon wanted to protect his father's legacy, which you would have tainted with a release of Exhale.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> We'll write six-figure checks to a handful of eggshell plaintiffs, and meanwhile, we're making over 200 million bucks profit.<eos> - No one will care.<eos> - Jon did.
Your mother has chosen to... recuse herself from the situation.<eos> She finds this whole thing a bit unpalatable.<eos> - So, we're supposed to take care of you?<eos> - Unpalatable?<eos> It's fine. It's all taken care of. I've made certain arrangements.<eos> I'll be euthanizing myself this evening.<eos> So, Valerie, did you have a nice birthday?<eos> What the fuck, Alex? What the fuck?<eos> She just left?<eos> He did everything.
Charles Cole.<eos> And you are?<eos> Cecilia. From PostMates!<eos> ID?<eos> I'm fucked up.<eos> And not, like garden-variety teenage girl fucked up.<eos> I mean actually fucked up.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> 'Cause I wanted him to die.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Previously on Tyrant...<eos> The Al Fayeed dynasty must end.<eos> I don't want a hair touched on his head, but this can't be allowed to continue.<eos> Arrest him.<eos> Fauzi Nidal is missing.<eos> I'll take Ghani and I'll go.<eos> And then when things are better, we'll find each other again.<eos> - Do you need me to be brave?<eos> - I really do.
You killed me.<eos> You killed me.<eos> You killed me.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> It's nice out here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> You know what today is?<eos> Or... would have been?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm not asking you to love me.<eos> I'm asking you to provide me with a child.<eos> It's a physical act, that's all.<eos> There is no way...<eos> You owe me this.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> You could've let me die.<eos> You should've let me die, but you chose me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
No more secrets and no more lies!<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> You're not FBI.<eos> You hate the FBI!<eos> This entire government betrayed you.<eos> I... am bringing you in.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> Put it down.<eos> - Doesn't have to be this way.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Brave FBI man, huh?<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> You don't answer, they pay.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> Is there anyone else with you?<eos> What do you know about our mission, hmm?<eos> Who knows you're here, huh?<eos> !<eos> You do.
But they hate that U.S. is meddling in the Middle East.<eos> They vowed to burn us down.<eos> Whatever it is they have planned, it's not gonna be good for us.<eos> - We've gotta to stop them.<eos> - Sure, let's get right on that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The passengers.<eos> They're still alive.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> I do.
So I need you to send a team to the island to make sure that they're all right.<eos> Just do it.<eos> I'm suspending Agent Patterson, effective immediately.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Her actions resulted in a man's death.<eos> She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
We're getting dangerously close to 60,000 feet.<eos> We got to do something.<eos> All right.<eos> One shot in the fuel tank.<eos> That'll cause an explosion big enough to bring this plane down.<eos> Jane...<eos> I'm sorry that I brought you here, all right?<eos> I chose this life, you didn't.<eos> You never had a choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
It's coming in way too steep.<eos> Not yet.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Okay, now, pull up.<eos> I don't think we're gonna make it.<eos> Break, break, break.<eos> Good job.<eos> No one does what she does.
Please.<eos> I'm gonna put this down.<eos> Please, I don't want to hurt you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Charlie, please don't.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Come on! Charlie, I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Charlie, stop!<eos> You didn't have to...<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'm dropping it.<eos> Matthew Weitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Whoever's listening to me right now, I know you're there.<eos> Call me.<eos> You want to tell me why a federal prosecutor's bugging my apartment?<eos> Is it better or worse when you thought I was CIA?<eos> - No, no.<eos> You have no right...<eos> - Actually, I do.
Okay, does Invidia have any gates in the radius?<eos> Ah, okay.<eos> No current properties.<eos> But there was an old gated community that was purchased by developers in 2008 that employed them.<eos> Looks like the project's been in limbo since the economy crashed, but all the houses are still there unoccupied.<eos> All right, give us the address. No one likes a tattletale.<eos> I didn't tell Camila, I swear.<eos> - This time, I won't leave a mark.<eos> - I swear!<eos> Please don't!
I shot him in the stomach.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> You can't just disappear like that!<eos> I was trying to protect...<eos> It was reckless!<eos> You can't take those risks.<eos> It is not your call.<eos> You're right.<eos> How did you trace the team to the power plant?<eos> I didn't...
Take it up with the sensors.<eos> Activating fire suppression system.<eos> Go! Go, go, go, go!<eos> Run! Run!<eos> We're in.<eos> Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
I see a lot of myself in you.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You know, you once told me that women get judged more harshly than men, so I don't want what Caleb's been up to to get out and blindside you.<eos> What's Caleb been up to?<eos> I thought you went out.<eos> What are you eating?<eos> Bacon, tomato, lettuce sandwich.<eos> - Don't judge.<eos> - I don't.
I'd like that.<eos> You know, you once told me that women get judged more harshly than men, so I don't want what Caleb's been up to to get out and blindside you.<eos> What's Caleb been up to?<eos> I thought you went out.<eos> What are you eating?<eos> Bacon, tomato, lettuce sandwich.<eos> - Don't judge.<eos> - I don't.<eos> I-I didn't know you liked bacon.<eos> I don't.
I'm not writing you off.<eos> I'm forgetting you ever existed, which is convenient, since that's what the FBI will be doing, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah, I just can't believe all this is over. Yeah, me, too.<eos> I start at the D.C. field office tomorrow.<eos> Oh, so it's like your graduation, too.<eos> Well, I better get up there, or nobody's going anywhere.<eos> And here I thought you didn't want me to make it to this day.<eos> I didn't.
They died to save millions, to kill the cancer that is the FBI before it takes the country with it.<eos> Are you really proud to wear that badge?<eos> Of course I'm proud.<eos> You're proud of the organization that tried to blackmail Martin Luther King into killing himself, put the Japanese in internment camps, botched Waco, instigated Omaha, let flawed DNA put innocent people behind bars?<eos> You're proud of that?<eos> You want to defend that?<eos> Alex, you were so busy at Quantico trying to get redemption for killing your father that you never saw me making you into a scapegoat.<eos> And you make a great scapegoat, Alex, because you believe in this country even after it thought you were a terrorist.<eos> You still love America, and you think it loves you back, but it doesn't.<eos> Never did.
Appearances can be deceiving, given the fact that radiation damage is almost entirely internal.<eos> Well, almost.<eos> Aside from the superficial scarring and the lifelong elevated risk of rare mutation-based cancers, I'm surprisingly healthy.<eos> And what about your previous situation?<eos> Oh, "The Company" has not come knocking.<eos> Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
Scott Walker was investigated for possession of child pornography 10 years ago, but there were no charges made.<eos> So your instincts were right.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> 14 more names off the list.<eos> That's everyone in the office.<eos> Did you look hard, really look for their tells?<eos> How about you?<eos> You maybe missed some signs while flirting with Garnett.<eos> He asked me out... you out.<eos> He did?
If I move to Europe,<eos> - I can live in the same city as...<eos> - You can't quit.<eos> I knew you were gonna say that.<eos> They lied to you.<eos> Yeah, they did, but they're not anymore.<eos> They only met up with you for one final cash infusion before disappearing for good.<eos> Caleb was too afraid to tell you.<eos> Caleb said that?<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
What is Caleb Brown's weakness?<eos> This is gonna be the easiest case I have ever tried.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> The defendant has a history of arrest for robbing high-end houses while working as a cater waiter.<eos> Sadie Beakman caught her in the act and the defendant killed her in order to get away.<eos> Isn't that all circumstantial?<eos> Yes, which is why it's a good thing I have you...<eos> An eyewitness.<eos> The defendant really should've taken that plea deal I offered.<eos> Yeah. Why didn't she?
Hell, the mailman probably knows it, given how much Roger talks about it.<eos> It was a very traumatic experience.<eos> As is this. I'd like you to leave.<eos> Sorry, Roger. No can do.<eos> Sadie wanted your glass.<eos> - If not for DNA, then why?<eos> - Perhaps a fingerprint.<eos> Why would Sadie need his fingerprint?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Your wife does.
Well, it's kind of my life's dream, but if you want me to stop, I'll do it for you.<eos> I had a bad dream last night.<eos> I think that this retirement thing<eos> - is making me very scared.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Join the club.<eos> Just not my country club.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
- Hey. M.K. didn't show.<eos> If M.K. shut you down, I'm sure she had good cause.<eos> I'm out of options, Dizzy.<eos> I need you to help me find her.<eos> You keep banging on my door, asking for favours.<eos> You ever think about what I might want?<eos> - Alright, what?<eos> - I need to know exactly what's going on between you and this twin of yours.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Holy shit. Sarah, talk some sense into her, please.<eos> What are you doing, Mika?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - There's a bomb under my chair.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I need him.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
You raised a Castor clone instead. Please be kind to Ira.<eos> Castor was never completely under my control to be raised homogeneously like that.<eos> I wanted him to be different.<eos> And me?<eos> Raised by Aldous Leekie.<eos> Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside.<eos> Helsinki.<eos> You weren't supposed to know about... Helsinki.<eos> Well I do.
We may have been raised without familiar bonds, but... you, Ira, are my brother.<eos> And I'm beginning to believe that means something.<eos> You just stood without your crutches.<eos> And your aphasia completely cleared.<eos> Apparently, passion helps.<eos> No coffee, but I made chai.<eos> You still feeling it? Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
So, you just have a little think about it, Ok?<eos> Where would you find Sarah?<eos> The location.<eos> I'm gonna get back in touch with you... real soon.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Alison!<eos> Are you, uh... Are you alright?<eos> Let me help with this.<eos> I don't know what came over me, heh!<eos> Oh, I do.
I'm really sorry.<eos> Okay. Hmm. Okay, um,<eos> I'm gonna leave you with your real family for a while.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> We spoke to Trina.<eos> Um, I knew her from before.<eos> I was just coming back with lunch.<eos> They killed Tabitha, didn't they?<eos> Well, if they did, they...
We're back on top, Susan.<eos> We hope.<eos> The board will make its recommendations.<eos> Recommendations to whom?<eos> I will see you in the morning.<eos> Took me a while to realize what the cell regeneration rates mean to you.<eos> You knew this was on the table, Cosima.<eos> It was there when you gave us Kendall's cancer cells.<eos> You don't even care about a cure, do you?<eos> Of course I do!
Uh, wrap the frames in it.<eos> Is that Sean's shirt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're supposed to be packing it.<eos> Meeting my girlfriend for breakfast.<eos> I didn't know you two were official.<eos> She told her dad.<eos> He flipped out.<eos> Dads can be protective sometimes, but he'll be all right when he meets you.<eos> He already did.
I can't be here.<eos> Look, Carol, these people found -- no, I can't, Morgan.<eos> I won't. I'll wait. And when you're not there to stop me, when nobody else is, I'll go.<eos> You know i can't let you. No. I'll -- you'll what?<eos> Tie me up like that wolf?<eos> Is that it?<eos> It isn't up to you.<eos> It wasn't before in the basement, it wasn't at the library, and it isn't now.<eos> I don't give a shit if you think you've found the secret to life.<eos> I -- no, I don't. I don't.
It's good we're here.<eos> How's that?<eos> 10 more minutes, and I might start to regret all the times i tried to shoot and stab you.<eos> I think you're my favorite person I ever knocked out.<eos> Definitely top two or three.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> Always watching, always ready, remember?<eos> I do.
I think you should jump out the window to save me the trouble of killing you.<eos> Oh! Now, there is the kid that impressed the hell out of me.<eos> I think you're not saying what you're gonna do to me because you're not going to do anything.<eos> If you knew us, if you knew anything, you would kill us.<eos> But you can't.<eos> Maybe you're right. Maybe I can't.<eos> Let's go for a ride, kid.<eos> Daryl!<eos> You seem worried, so I'm taking the kid home.<eos> If you do anything to him... Dwight!
We're not the rabbit.<eos> We're the boy!<eos> Wow. That must have been some ceremony.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't you even want to know if you got in?<eos> Nope, didn't get in.<eos> Come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.<eos> Honestly, I didn't.
First of all, I love you with all of my heart, and I love us.<eos> That's good to know, baby.<eos> I love you too. Mm. Wow, you smell fantastic.<eos> I'm in a situation.<eos> Svetlana.<eos> We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
I manage to get this woman and her mother and the frickin' dog out into the street.<eos> I run back inside.<eos> What do I see? I see Frank coming down the stairs, through the flames, carrying a baby.<eos> Now, he's almost out the door of the building when we hear somebody else screaming.<eos> Well, yeah. So I hand Lenny the kid and I head back upstairs.<eos> I head out the door, and all of a sudden, there's all these photographers outside, snapping photographs of this white cop cradling a black baby.<eos> The crowd is cheering, Lenny's taking bows...<eos> Two minutes later, Frank comes stumbling out, covered in soot, helping this old man in his underwear.<eos> Now, nobody wants to see a picture of an old man in his underwear with a cop holding him.<eos> Well, maybe now they do, but...
Thank you, Frank.<eos> What'd you name your sports bar in Florida?<eos> Well, I-I decided to keep it humble. I called it The Hero's Den.<eos> And what did you use as the logo?<eos> Well, the picture of me and the baby. Iconic.<eos> You know, somebody really should write all this down.<eos> Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.

You have rights, Frank.<eos> You never gave consent, you never sat down for an on-the-record interview.<eos> They're portraying you as the lead actor in stories that are all but impossible to fact-check.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> He was my partner.<eos> I do not want to go all legal on him.<eos> And I hope you don't have to.<eos> Hopefully, he'll listen to reason.<eos> You don't know Lenny. No.<eos> I don't.
Throwing ourselves in our work at a time when this city might as well have been the Wild West.<eos> That has a nice ring to it.<eos> The book has a different ring.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Broadway Frank Reagan and his merry band of head-knocking, hard-drinking, stewardess-banging mad dogs.<eos> There'd be no high moral ground left to you.<eos> There'd be no coming back.<eos> I know that.<eos> I know you know.<eos> What do I do?
Hey. You made a deal?<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> It's a year's license suspension...<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Five years probation,<eos> - $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Improper opinion.<eos> Sustained.<eos> What about any other witnesses who...<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Yes, Ms. Shelby, move on.<eos> Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
Stop the car, Teresa.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> - This is crazy.<eos> - Look at me.<eos> I was running from Epifanio and stumbled into Camila's mule route.<eos> She could've killed me.<eos> She didn't.<eos> We saw them kill Chino.<eos> They killed Guero, and you're working for that puta?<eos> Epifanio did, not her.
I don't care how long it takes,<eos> I'm not abandoning my post until the CO tells me to.<eos> What mission?<eos> What mission?<eos> Sleeping Beauty!<eos> Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
Hey, that's ok for you but who do the rest of us count on?<eos> Relapsed vampires?<eos> The asshole that killed my wife?<eos> You see what's happening.<eos> - They're scared, I get that.<eos> - They're rats in a cage.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they turn on each other.<eos> Or you.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> Maybe we all do.
She made it out.<eos> She made it out.<eos> See?<eos> Never give up.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We all saw her hanging there.<eos> It was murder.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
The blood bank or whatever it is.<eos> Well you ought to teach her to read because I put a sign on the door that clearly says "keep out".<eos> You asshole!<eos> I got this.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of every gadget you've stashed around this place.<eos> Why would I do something stupid like that?<eos> Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives.<eos> That is why.<eos> You got a pencil?<eos> I do.
That ain't happening.<eos> He's in here! He's in here!<eos> Oh, shit! Shit!<eos> What have you done, huh?<eos> What the hell have you done? !<eos> Christ!<eos> I'm gonna need those keys.<eos> It didn't have to be like this, man.<eos> - Not like this!<eos> - No, it didn't.
You're killing us.<eos> You realize that, right?<eos> You're basically sending us out there to die.<eos> You mean exactly what you were about to do to us?<eos> And what you already did to Mohamad.<eos> This is-he was a murderer.<eos> Liar!<eos> We never said we were gonna kill you!<eos> Liar.<eos> We didn't.
You don't think these people look like they could use a rest?<eos> I'm just saying maybe that's not what everybody wants right now.<eos> Maybe some of us have other ideas as to what we wanna do with our lives right now.<eos> Such as?<eos> I don't-I'm just saying!<eos> Look, I'm just trying to keep you people safe, and that includes you, Doc.<eos> Until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah. Maybe I do.
- You were right.<eos> - Welcome home, son.<eos> You have the Oval.<eos> This is what power looks like.<eos> Guess what...<eos> I am a big dog.<eos> I was trying to save us!<eos> There is no us!<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
You want a target?<eos> I'll give you a fucking target.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So, you know, once we're rolling, I'll ask any question I want.<eos> Hope you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> What I'm about to say, I'm not sure you're ready.<eos> Ready to go in five... four...<eos> Come on, Trip, I don't need this shit.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's the most un-Dolls thing you've ever said to me.<eos> Pardner, they're looking to settle up the tab.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> What a shit.<eos> Waverly, I can explain.<eos> There is a face that I didn't want to see again.<eos> Jay Novak, my probation officer.<eos> Why would your friend Henry kill him?<eos> - He didn't.
So, when he was after you the first time, where'd you see him next, after Jitters?<eos> Home. He came to our house when he took you.<eos> Wally's there now.<eos> No, no, Dad, this is good.<eos> We know where he is, and we know what he wants. That means we know how to beat him.<eos> How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.
What are you saying?<eos> Look,<eos> I know that you had an experience in the Speed Force.<eos> And I'm happy that you think we're gonna win the day.<eos> But I think a little fear can be a healthy thing.<eos> It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> T+U+S+U+B+T+I+T+U+L+O I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
- The warden was smart. He's not in any of these pictures, and we can't even prove that he took 'em.<eos> Now, we leak it, it just gives him a chance to cover his tracks.<eos> We need to... think about this.<eos> We need some time. We ain't got time, Jackie.<eos> Nurse Amy said she found something, then, an hour later, she winds up dead.<eos> And it wasn't from no damn suicide, and you know it!<eos> - I know, Shawn. I know.<eos> - Then do something about it! I don't have the answers, Sean!<eos> Look, this is complicated.<eos> Between Terry, the warden, what you did to Bobby Marks.
Oh, my God, maybe you had nothing to do with it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> In that case, China would be blamed for your messages going public, maybe.<eos> So is that what I think happened?<eos> That China tweeted this?<eos> Oh, no, ma'am, no.<eos> You have no idea what happened.<eos> And neither does Mike, who would be outraged by this.<eos> Actually, ma'am, I have a better idea.<eos> No, you don't, Mike.
You gonna start lying now?<eos> You leave her alone.<eos> Hey, that guy you shot, genius, was the one with the key.<eos> You shot our captain.<eos> That true?<eos> - Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One. - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
No further questions.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> Ben, this is real. The whole room was sniffing around Cuntgate.<eos> - It's not a gate, Mike.<eos> - No kidding!<eos> It isn't a gate. I agree. I said that.<eos> She's becoming seriously unhinged.<eos> She has gone full metal Nixon.<eos> Who do you think said it?<eos> Well, we did.
No.<eos> I haven't slept in a box in years.<eos> Stop. Now that Pied Piper's funded, I have enough money to move back into my condo.<eos> Oh.<eos> Congratulations. I thought you sold it.<eos> No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out to cover the mortgage.<eos> But it'll be good to get home.<eos> I've been missing my tub a lot, and Noah's been using a lot of hate speech with me lately, so moving will be a good thing.<eos> All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off unless you need me to stick around, help you transition.<eos> - I... - By doing what?
Me?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, the occupant of a residence in California has almost unlimited rights.<eos> I have to get his permission to enter my property.<eos> I can't turn off the power or the gas, and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction.<eos> That won't be cheap. Jeez, man.<eos> I'm sorry. That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
Get it through your heads. Both of you.<eos> This place is dangerous.<eos> That woman is dangerous.<eos> She's just upset.<eos> I can talk to her.<eos> You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
She wanted her son back.<eos> You can understand that!<eos> Right?<eos> So that's what I did, Mom. I just brought him back.<eos> And now we get to stay.<eos> You know, I'd do the same for you. What?<eos> I can bring Travis back.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
- We have no place to go, Papa.<eos> Wait!<eos> Papa!<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I know what he meant to you.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Nick.<eos> - He's just-- - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that- - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
A lot of asses in your face.<eos> Thankyou so much, Senator James.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's going very well, thanks.<eos> - And Bob's your uncle.<eos> - Knock, knock, future calling.<eos> Cheese, please, Louise.<eos> Gentlemen, you know the first daughter.<eos> We do.
I trust the American people to make the right decision.<eos> What if you think they're gonna make a certain decision and they make a different decision and then it completely derails what you thought was gonna happen?<eos> - And then your plans are different.<eos> - Oh, honey, don't cry.<eos> Mommy's gonna get elected, honey.<eos> Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
Cut the shit, Big Head.<eos> I see exactly what you're doing.<eos> Poaching my tenants?<eos> You stole my business model. What?<eos> No.<eos> Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
Everybody dies.<eos> Yeah, easy for you to say.<eos> Pablo's entire lifespan measured about a second, compared to yours.<eos> Didn't he make that second count?<eos> In defeating Baal, he achieved more than I did in thousands of years.<eos> Man, you can really taste the angel dust.<eos> But no matter how baked I get, you're still gone, buddy.<eos> Man, I wish I could just go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> So just do it.<eos> "Do it?" Do what?
The lesson was to play along, to act as if, not to become one of them.<eos> You don't fit in with these guys.<eos> We all know that. But what you did, saving James today, that was huge.<eos> You proved your worth.<eos> Shoot, you could come out of this a hero.<eos> I don't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you.<eos> Look, just be careful how you play this, Dad.<eos> We need them.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I do.
Gracias.<eos> _<eos> Is he okay? He'll be okay.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Mom?<eos> There's something I didn't say last night.<eos> Something I need you to understand.<eos> You don't need to say anything.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Travis, what the hell, man?<eos> Travis?<eos> Travis!<eos> - Travis!<eos> Travis!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - No, Travis!<eos> - Stop! What did you do?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> What did you do?
Well, I can't imagine that would matter to Dinesh one iota.<eos> Right. Cause she's nice, and... very talented, and has a great laugh.<eos> And with any luck, she's not a dogface.<eos> How was your date with Winnie?<eos> Well, pretty good, considering she's still in the other room.<eos> Baller, you got lucky on the first date. Yeah, did a little bit... not everything.<eos> I mean, I slept in my jeans.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Hunger is the best sauce.<eos> We did a little bit of under the shirts and, like, finger banging.
I want you to break into hell with me and rob the gods blind.<eos> Why would I do anything with you?<eos> Because of what's in that safe.<eos> I have the combination.<eos> May I?<eos> I could simply change you, make you follow me.<eos> But that's not my way.<eos> I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you.<eos> Because when you do, you won't have the faintest idea what to do with yourself.<eos> And I do.
- Yeah.<eos> Dr. Mirani worked overnight. She's almost at her 30-hour max.<eos> We need to get her into the O.R. while she's still fresh.<eos> What about me?<eos> You're always fresh.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> Shahir, look, my brain can wait.<eos> It's her first lead surgery.<eos> Come on. You remember your first time.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm feeling really sad too, Dad.<eos> Nothing cheers people up like a baby.<eos> Boy, we each have to do our part, and I'm gonna make dinner.<eos> And I'm gonna start with...<eos> Ice cream!<eos> Come back!<eos> Don't make me jog.<eos> Why is your father chasing after the spay and neuter van?<eos> You got me.<eos> What do I do with you?
What? Cathy, what's wrong?<eos> I... ah-ah-ah... ah... Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy, when we got married, you used to speak for hours.<eos> But since we moved to New York City, nothing!<eos> Wow. It all magically fits.<eos> Come on, Cathy, say something!<eos> Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did.
Specifically beckett, I'm assuming?<eos> Still a wee bit upset, huh?<eos> The anger flares up from time to time, yes.<eos> She did it out of love.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> At the end of the day,<eos> She's worth it. I'm glad I met you, richard.<eos> I'm glad I met you, too.<eos> But you didn't.
Previously on iZombie...<eos> Major is a zombie. I'm a zombie, too.<eos> Those 322 people are suspected zombies.<eos> - Kill them?<eos> - I'm a fan of submarine movies.<eos> Cut to the sailor who receives that order closing that hatch on his comrades.<eos> The man that closes that hatch is a hero, isn't he?<eos> If this doesn't work... If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
I killed Elena.<eos> What do you... what do you mean, you killed Elena?<eos> It was all Henry's idea.<eos> Told me I needed to free my true self so I kidnapped Tyler and made him take me to her coffin.<eos> And then I burned her to ashes.<eos> So go ahead.<eos> Stand by me.<eos> Tell me you'll never walk away.<eos> Go ahead, Stefan, come on.<eos> Do it. Do it!
Thank you very much.<eos> Okay, I will, uh... I will see all of you tomorrow.<eos> So, where are those Cubanos?<eos> I think I might've found something out.<eos> - You heard?<eos> - You know?<eos> - She told me this morning.<eos> - She who? Wait, what did you find out?<eos> I think Michael has a girlfriend.<eos> He does?
Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> He tried, but I stopped him.<eos> Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?<eos> It was Arnold's key insight, the thing that led the hosts to their awakening... suffering.<eos> The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.<eos> It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
You shouldn't torture yourself, Mum.<eos> Morning.<eos> Bill.<eos> Set to be a good one.<eos> Well, they often start out that way, pal.<eos> True, that's true.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> What are you doing here, Alastair?<eos> Sal not give you my message?<eos> She did, aye.
I would spend 100 years in there if I thought it would help Herrmann right now.<eos> You're a good chief, but you're an even better friend.<eos> The love around here for that guy is overwhelming, and that's what's gonna get him through this.<eos> Trudy.<eos> Herrmann is gonna pull through this.<eos> I just know it.<eos> I sure hope so.<eos> I'm sorry about that... God-awful proposal.<eos> Having Herrmann down and out like this... The guy's my best friend, you know?<eos> I do.
Here's what I know.<eos> We see heartbreak every day.<eos> And we live our lives imperfectly as a result of that.<eos> You're a human being, Randy, and there is no shame in that.<eos> I should've told her.<eos> Next time you will.<eos> Hey, Leon.<eos> It's your big bro.<eos> Just wanted to hear your voice, man, see how you're doing.<eos> Hey, you guys. How you doing?
Yeah. Bye.<eos> He blamed it on Red and Bobby.<eos> So, what? They're not gonna arrest him now?<eos> Well, they can't.<eos> It's his word against Red, Bobby and Amy.<eos> They're all dead, so they got nothing to go on.<eos> What about the human bones all over his property?<eos> What do you want me to say, Gil?<eos> We know he did it. We just can't prove it.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Hello?<eos> Hi, Ms. Nagle, it's Janey calling from Dr. Parson's office.<eos> How are you? Hi, Janey.<eos> I'm good, thank you.<eos> So, we got the labs back from your 12-week visit, and everything looks great.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you want to know what you're having?<eos> Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound, so I can tell you if it's a boy or a girl.<eos> If you want to know.<eos> Actually, I do.
So, he sliced up Velez, stuffed a bomb inside him, and then dumped him at the same site.<eos> He assumed the body of his second victim would go to the same morgue as the first.<eos> The bomb would destroy, or contaminate, any evidence that led back to him.<eos> Whatever remained would be inadmissible.<eos> He inadvertently calculated correctly.<eos> Omar Velez was a dead end, but if we can figure out who wanted her dead, we'll have our bomber.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Okay, so who was she?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
The restraints are for your own good.<eos> See?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> So you don't hurt yourself.<eos> Or, heaven forbid, your baby.<eos> My son. Yes.<eos> Your son.<eos> It was her.<eos> She tied you up, not me.<eos> She did it, she did it, she did it, she did it, she did it, she did it...
Well, I can tell you, there is a large segment of people who live here who do not agree.<eos> Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.<eos> Concerns that have been resolved through hours of conversation and reviewing the data.<eos> President Shwe got on board for a very good reason.<eos> If Conrad would call me back...<eos> President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.<eos> And I promise you that this is an agreement that you can represent to the people of Myanmar proudly.<eos> See you then.<eos> I don't know how we missed this.<eos> We didn't.
Yes, Mr. President, I am as surprised as...<eos> Well, I-I spoke with an aide from President Shwe's office and there has been no change in schedule.<eos> As soon as the agreement is signed, I'll call.<eos> Sir, it is a good deal.<eos> In all fairness, sir, I-I don't think anyone could have anticipated a U.S. ambassador leading a demonstration against his own country.<eos> With that said, I'm gonna do everything I can to...<eos> Sir? Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
- It was just a temporary fix.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> Trying to one up all of us like usual.<eos> You know what we call her.<eos> Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth...<eos> like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> - We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that. - I didn't!<eos> I didn't!
No.<eos> No towels, sí.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ready? ♪ When the forest burns along the road ♪ ♪ Like God's eyes in my headlights ♪<eos> On to Plan B.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get away from him now, you filthy, little gobshites.<eos> It's me you're lookin' for, right?<eos> And honestly, boys, I don't know how you keep finding me.<eos> Truly, I don't.
No idea what's coming for him.<eos> Where shall we put John Baugh?<eos> Here, with Bowie.<eos> Not with Travis?<eos> No. Fell back with Jim Bowie.<eos> Met his end manning that 12-pounder in the chapel there.<eos> But Bowie died in the barracks, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> - I had an idea, Mr. Quincannon.<eos> - Did you?
I work here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're his Tulip?<eos> Of course.<eos> I should have known that.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> What you doing?<eos> Putting stuff away.<eos> Emily asked me to help out, so, uh... I'm helping out.<eos> Emily did?
All right.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I will get out of your hair.<eos> When I saw him this morning before church, he said he was gonna come by to find you.<eos> Before church...<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I-I didn't see him.<eos> It's the darndest thing.<eos> Actually, you did see him.<eos> I did?
What's this for?<eos> It's for me, Padre. Or will you let me burn, too?<eos> Where'd Cassidy go?<eos> Jesse?<eos> Where's Cassidy?<eos> Jesse? You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> Jesus.<eos> That's right.<eos> You did.
Yes, I am!<eos> Jesus. Where is God?<eos> I am the Resurrection!<eos> I am the way and the truth!<eos> Where is God? !<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
Water.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Water.<eos> I was born on Star Haven.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, my father took me there when I was younger.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> The air smelled like cinnamon.<eos> It did, didn't it?
She was a great woman.<eos> Fort Rozz was the paradise of Alura's design.<eos> And I'm carrying on her great work.<eos> All you've done is dishonor her memory.<eos> What I have done is protect this city.<eos> This world.<eos> Humans understand little about justice.<eos> Justice must be absolute.<eos> I'd hoped that you'd see justice the same way your mother did.<eos> The way I do.
It wasn't...<eos> It was just something between us.<eos> Not you and I. Between me and Lucy.<eos> So, it didn't have anything to do with you.<eos> Or Supergirl.<eos> It had nothing to do with you or Supergirl.<eos> It's just obvious how much she loves you and...<eos> I think, she knows<eos> - how much you love her...<eos> - Maybe I didn't.
Amputated.<eos> Skinned.<eos> Drained.<eos> Injected with experimental drugs.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No.<eos> No one does.
Afraid I'll win?<eos> You've already lost.<eos> Accept it and the glorious fulfillment of Astra's vision.<eos> In the end, she defeated you.<eos> This doesn't look like victory to me.<eos> And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.<eos> Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah, him.<eos> - With the... the hairy arms?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ugh, they were so hairy.<eos> When he would put his arms around me, he would tickle my ears.<eos> How long were you guys together?<eos> Couple months.<eos> I think you're better off anyway.<eos> I didn't see you guys together.<eos> Apparently, he didn't either.
It won't come off! It won't come off!<eos> I warned you not to wear that mask outside the ring.<eos> Get it off me.<eos> Get it off. What have you done?<eos> Gah, cut it off.<eos> Burn it off.<eos> Do whatever you have to do.<eos> Just get it off me! I told you it can only be removed with the Ceremonia de Desgracias.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just do it!
- Got it.<eos> - Check the incoming calls.<eos> I know this number.<eos> - Dano's.<eos> - Hey, it's Fisher.<eos> Did you make a phone call a couple hours ago<eos> - to a Dr. Kukra?<eos> - Is that a real name?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And did you?
- Yeah, 'kay, bye.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cameron, the way you've been acting, like charging right into things and you're so impulsive,<eos> I don't know if you're overcompensating, or trying to impress me...<eos> No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
Certain issues have arisen which will lead to a delay in wages being paid.<eos> Just for today, that's all.<eos> Just a day... or so.<eos> But I can assure you that it is temporary and will be rectified as soon as possible.<eos> It's no use looking to me.<eos> - I know as much as all you do.<eos> - So you'd say?<eos> - If you knew something?<eos> - Aye.<eos> But I don't.
This whole town is to pack up and move on?<eos> There's the family house.<eos> If I borrow money against that, we can pay the men.<eos> It might give Jericho a chance at least.<eos> Well, then do it.<eos> It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
My brother will need to be found.<eos> Are you really sure, sir?<eos> If it was any other man, I'd be expected to send a search party.<eos> It'll be no different for him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You're not the first and you won't be the last, love.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The world is full of men like Rory.<eos> Promise the earth to get what they want.<eos> Well, he did.
Aren't we going to the airlock?<eos> Already sealed.<eos> You ok?<eos> I'm fine. Yeah.<eos> I-I...<eos> I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know. But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
I've never even been off this rig.<eos> Trust me, that's a good thing. Heh.<eos> I'm Jasper.<eos> - Shay.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Jasper's actually smiling.<eos> Clarke. Let it go.<eos> We can't just leave.<eos> It's not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
The one black kid had a blade, the other was backing him up.<eos> I shot in self-defense.<eos> That's for a grand jury to decide.<eos> You would have done the same thing-- any cop would have.<eos> You will have your day in court, you have my word.<eos> Your word?<eos> I served your father with distinction for 20 years.<eos> You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.<eos> This has got nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course it does.
What? What's the emergency?<eos> Veronica Mars here wants to stitch into Sandy.<eos> Maggie gave the go-ahead?<eos> Okay, then we're going behind Maggie's back.<eos> Intriguing, tell me more.<eos> I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does?
- It was nothing.<eos> I... I went outside to check on a noise and I forgot to wipe the dirt off my feet.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I thought you meant hobbit feet as in hairy.<eos> Yeah, you've seen my feet.<eos> - Did they suddenly sprout?<eos> Mm. Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why'd you tell him?<eos> Why didn't you?
Trust me, it helps.<eos> That's not just tea.<eos> No. Some situations require more than just tea.<eos> Like when you shoot your first person?<eos> You didn't have a choice.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
It would help you get closer to finding your father.<eos> Hey. How you feeling?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Well, your brain scan came back clean.<eos> There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
Where were you Friday night?<eos> One of my kids was sick.<eos> I spent the night in the emergency room.<eos> And I got no idea how I'm gonna pay for it.<eos> Guess what I've got.<eos> Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.<eos> Hodgins did.
Well, I never saw her use drugs.<eos> That wasn't my question.<eos> Look, are you willing to swear that you didn't know?<eos> 'Cause we got her e-mails.<eos> She said it was only once in a while.<eos> So, you let a known drug user work in your office defending clients.<eos> It wasn't right, but I understood.<eos> If she lost a case, a family got broken up or a child's hopes for the future destroyed.<eos> She needed an outlet.<eos> We all do.
I'm sorry that I'm yawning.<eos> Today's been really exciting and I guess it's just kinda catching up to me.<eos> Say no more. I'm gonna grab the sleeping bag.<eos> Bag-a? Or bag-zzza?<eos> Thought we could share. Is that cool?<eos> That's cool.<eos> And it should be cool. And I want it to be cool.<eos> But it's not cool yet.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, I don't.
- Big ones. All right, so, ah, I was thinking martinis.<eos> Uh, I also have some tequila.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I know you likey.<eos> I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
Look, it was dark.<eos> I don't know where I was going.<eos> I just know that I was trying to get the hell out of there.<eos> Not to mention the fact that I had just driven my car into a tree, so please, forgive me if I wasn't exactly thinking straight.<eos> Well, you might have a concussion, you know. Yes.<eos> And I will get myself checked out, I swear, but right now, I just need to get to my mother.<eos> She's probably worried sick about me.<eos> Do you remember what kind of dog it was?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't.
You remember Meisner?<eos> I've seen him.<eos> I know he's here.<eos> Wait, you've seen him, and he hasn't told you?<eos> Told me what?<eos> He was in the helicopter that night.<eos> He killed the king and got Diana.<eos> Meisner has Diana?<eos> I said he got her, not that he has her.<eos> - Then who does?
It's time.<eos> Thanksgiving has always meant sharing the bounty of our rich land, especially turkey.<eos> But the one thing we will not be sharing this holiday is Drumstick or Cranberry.<eos> Catherine actually personally chose those names, didn't you, honey?<eos> - Um, yes, I did.<eos> - Yes, she did.
This the sacrifice you were talking about?<eos> - You knew this was gonna happen?<eos> - Ticky-tock, those eyes.<eos> Left, right, swaying like a granddaddy clock.<eos> Can't take 'em off me.<eos> God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
These people were starving.<eos> Like us. We should get the bodies down and burn them before we go.<eos> How far did you get?<eos> - How far did you...<eos> I used the tracker and the coordinates.<eos> Nothing is there.<eos> I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse. Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
Attention Night Room shoppers...<eos> Almost there.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> Oh, my God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.
Almost there.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> Oh, my God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then I did.
In her hand.<eos> In her goddamned hand!<eos> A little piece of plastic.<eos> It was an action figure, wasn't it?<eos> One of those things you make so much money off of.<eos> She grabbed it just before she fucking died!<eos> She knew I would figure it out, and it would lead me<eos> - back to you, Craig!<eos> - I didn't kill her.<eos> I didn't...
Sorry.<eos> Uh, hi, excuse me, how long is this flight delayed?<eos> It's just, I'm supposed to be meeting my husband in New York.<eos> - Is-is that a good oof - or a bad oof?<eos> - There is no good oof.<eos> I have one seat on Flight 47 that's leaving right now.<eos> - If you hurry, I can... - Oh, no, I can't do that flight.<eos> I strongly encourage you to get on the earlier flight unless you want to spend the night next to that guy.<eos> Why did he fall asleep on that wet spot?<eos> He didn't.
- Just be his wingman for a few hours. - Uh...<eos> I know a pretty good place where lots of older women go when they got nothing left to live for.<eos> - A craft store?<eos> - Yeah. I buy all my art supplies here.<eos> Okay, the knitters are sweet.<eos> The quilters can be a little antisocial.<eos> But I'd steer clear of that scrapbooking aisle.<eos> Those women will murder you while humming to themselves.<eos> You know, I appreciate the gesture, guys, but you really don't have to do this.<eos> No, I do.
Look, I just want to meet someone who I can talk to, someone who understands me.<eos> You know, someone like you.<eos> A good listener.<eos> You.<eos> I want to kiss you. - Someone like me.<eos> - I do want to kiss you.<eos> - No, no. - Yes, I do. - No.<eos> Please sit down. - You want to, too. - You must...<eos> - Oh. - I can tell.<eos> - I don't!
We bought it.<eos> We can have the life we always dreamed of.<eos> And I'm just supposed to forget about - all the crap that you put me through?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look, forget the last two years.<eos> Remember the first four.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Tell me you don't want to say "I love you."<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
- Ready, mama?<eos> These, uh, these scans are devastating.<eos> His liver's obliterated. He needs a transplant.<eos> There's no time to get him on the donor list. Uh, let's check the family for a match.<eos> They don't seem like the donating type.<eos> Well, might be his only option. I'll go and talk to them.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why is dad really here? I don't know.<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> No, you don't.
- The law says...<eos> - I know what the law says.<eos> I also know what Tia's father said and, frankly, what Dr. Perello said, which was, "stay out of it."<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I don't care. We did the right thing.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And you can call my attending and get me fired, but that girl is gonna keep her leg because I had the balls - to stand up for her!<eos> - Heather. I'm not gonna stand here and get scolded like I'm in high school.<eos> We did the right thing.
Beau's the one who's marked; Why doesn't he just go?<eos> And leave him to be hunted alone?<eos> We have to protect each other.<eos> We stay together.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave.<eos> Look, you love Caroline and you don't want her to die.<eos> I understand, because that is the way I feel about Nora and she will, we all will, if you do not get out of our way!<eos> Stay and I'll do everything I can to protect you from this woman.<eos> You don't stand a chance against her!<eos> - None of us do!
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not gonna leave her. I'll stay and help Valerie.<eos> Damon needs you.<eos> I don't care what Damon needs.<eos> I don't know what he did to make you hate him, but he is so determined to make things right, he's gonna get himself killed.<eos> Do you honestly think i would do anything to put Caroline at risk?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Stefan, go.<eos> We can take it from here.<eos> How we doing?
Okay.<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> We need to find where they keep the tests.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Steal the answers for next year?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You know, for your little side business.<eos> Where you sell the answers to desperate kids for money.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No, I do.
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you!<eos> Cut me loose.<eos> Tell me first!<eos> I traded her!<eos> - You traded my daughter? - That's right, I traded her.<eos> - Traded her for what?<eos> - I traded her for that fucking bell!<eos> You traded my daughter for a goddamn bell?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
France is in Europe.<eos> Know what I made outta this here silk?<eos> A dress?<eos> Why would I waste it on that?<eos> I made this fine table covering.<eos> For fancy company.<eos> Well, with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress,<eos> I bet you'd look real pretty in it.<eos> You got a wife Mr. Clay?<eos> Yes, I do.
Somewhere dark.<eos> Mozart?<eos> Debussy.<eos> So close.<eos> Come on, Blaine.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> I never forget a face.<eos> I'm surprised you remember me.<eos> The owner of a major league team usually doesn't remember the batboy.<eos> The good owners do.
Michelle?<eos> Okay, Michelle?<eos> It's okay, kiddo.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Daddy's right here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> You still want to convince yourselves there's nothing wrong with her?<eos> I'm guessing, by your expression, it doesn't look good.<eos> It doesn't.
You know, I'm, um... just ten minutes away.<eos> I'll call you in a little bit, okay?<eos> Give Owen a kiss for me.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> That feel okay?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> No, water's fine.<eos> Notice how normal she is with April, and then... and then her dad walks in.<eos> Hey. How you doing, kiddo?
No, but she's still on the island.<eos> Kirk's preparing her exit plan.<eos> I don't know what the preparations are, but I know who can find out-- Manuel Esteban.<eos> The Chilean Spymaster?<eos> - Who's Esteban?<eos> - Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.<eos> Esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer for a series of authoritarian regimes.<eos> Assuming what you say is true and Esteban is alive, what makes you think he can help locate Keen?<eos> Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
I came here to get Keen. I'm not leaving without her.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you tag along so you can inform the people who kidnapped Elizabeth they have the right to remain silent?<eos> I appreciate your assistance, but I'm not interested in having an ethical debate with you about whether they have the right to consult with an attorney before I put a bullet in their head.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What about that dirtball?<eos> I suppose you think, uh, I should be okay with letting him walk.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> You made a deal with him.<eos> Yes, in order to save Elizabeth, I made a deal with the devil of the day.<eos> I did.
I'm not saying what Agent Keen did was right, but as long as her life is in danger, as long as Agnes's life is in danger, I think we have to put our feelings aside.<eos> What's happening to Liz is her own fault.<eos> I know that sounds harsh, but it's true.<eos> She made decisions that have consequences, and now she has to live with them.<eos> - She's in trouble.<eos> - I know, and I'm angry about that.<eos> because if she'd behaved differently, she wouldn't be in this position.<eos> But she is.<eos> And no matter how we feel, I think we have to do something about it.<eos> I don't.
You cry all the time.<eos> I'm really ready for this to build into a compliment.<eos> The point is that you are comfortable with yourself, and you make people around you feel comfortable.<eos> They feel that they can talk to you.<eos> That's your superpower!<eos> Pool's drained, leaks are fixed, generator's running, and I'm meeting my buddies.<eos> Why, Jay?<eos> Why you have to go out?<eos> It's a hurricane outside!<eos> I just do.
Come on, Kirsty.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Kirsty?<eos> You'll stand by me, won't you?<eos> Erm...<eos> Sorry...<eos> Jess.<eos> That's what's wrong with you people.<eos> You think you own the bloody<eos> Actually, I do.
My brother.<eos> I thought you were an only child.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh.<eos> "Oh"?<eos> It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
Copy that.<eos> What have you got?<eos> Found a fresh print on that old pistol you guys recovered.<eos> Pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid.<eos> Ran it through AFIS, came up snake eyes.<eos> But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets inside the magazine.<eos> Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.<eos> I was able to lift them during a process called cyanoacrylate fuming, ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.<eos> Eric... did you get a hit?<eos> Indeed I did.
That's what Pilcher says, right?<eos> Dr. Yedlin.<eos> That was, uh, very impressive, what you did in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, segmental recession of saphenous vein interposition graft?<eos> That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't?
They should be here soon.<eos> Well, they'll be so happy to see the baby.<eos> They must miss you terribly.<eos> Yeah, they complain about it all the time.<eos> Always asking when I'm gonna move back to Seattle.<eos> - Do you ever think about that?<eos> - Oh, yeah, but I want to finish my fellowship.<eos> Oh. Well, you met Jeff here.<eos> You must have a lot of good memories here.<eos> Of course I do.
The end.<eos> Mr. Solloway?<eos> Yeah, th... thanks. Thanks, audrey.<eos> Questions, comments, concerns?<eos> Charlette?<eos> I thought it was really elegant, audrey.<eos> I liked the wind imagery.<eos> I felt your narrator's excitement. When the weather patterns changed unexpectedly.<eos> You don't agree, mr. Solloway?<eos> No, charlette, I don't.
Professor le gall is my adviser.<eos> Is she?<eos> For god's sakes, audrey, Nobody is condoning rape.<eos> We're just saying that the term "sexual assault".<eos> Is so expansively used now. That it dilutes public outrage. For the very crime you're trying to prosecute.<eos> Really, mike?<eos> Because a woman who cries sexual assault. Might just be looking for attention?<eos> Or... or maybe she was confused.<eos> Maybe she really did want it. Maybe she did.<eos> Maybe she did,
She loves you two very much.<eos> What do you got? - Blood pressure dropping.<eos> - Talk to me, Jesse.<eos> You clamped the chest tube.<eos> She must still be bleeding internally.<eos> Okay, hang another, mama. All lines wide open.<eos> Risa, call O.R. again. Tell them we need a room now!<eos> - Is she dying? !<eos> - She's in distress. She's not dying.<eos> You people did this to her.
I put you in a terrible situation, and... I'm sorry.<eos> But you should know that you didn't fail her at all.<eos> As to whether I was right to go find Connie...<eos> I keep asking myself... If I would have gone after her if I hadn't have met her little boy, and the hard answer is...<eos> No.<eos> So the decision I made was, in fact, an emotional one.<eos> And if Jocelyn had died...<eos> She didn't die.<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
Are you really not interested in my daughter?<eos> Dad.<eos> Lieutenant Yoon is a beloved colleague.<eos> But... during the seven years that I have known her, I never had any feelings towards her.<eos> That's a pity.<eos> All right.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Why are you out so soon?<eos> I thought you had something serious to talk about.<eos> We did.
Yes, you're right.<eos> Will she die? Or will she live?<eos> There is no 100 percent in medical science.<eos> But... for young and healthy patients like Myeong Ju, the fatality rate decreases sharply.<eos> Since they have a high level of immunity.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A cytokine storm?<eos> Isn't it a good thing to be young and healthy, since you have a high level of immunity?<eos> It's ironic, but having a high level of immunity can cause a problem, too.<eos> Then what do we do?
I mean, if it helps, I could give you a list of facilities around here that do that kind of work.<eos> Welcome.<eos> If I can help you with anything, let me know.<eos> Um, actually, I was hoping I could talk to you about the building you turned into an AwayKay.<eos> I remember you.<eos> You're the girlfriend-- Sherlock's.<eos> Yeah, you moved in with him about a year before I left.<eos> Uh, I'm not his girlfriend.<eos> And I didn't realize you two knew each other.<eos> We don't.
"Park is dedicated to empowering students "by encouraging autonomy and the development of personal responsibility"?<eos> - It does.<eos> - And did the student body demonstrate this responsibility in their reaction to Ms. Stowe's editorial?<eos> Oh, yes, they're the ones who petitioned the student council to have Ms. Stowe removed and the paper defunded.<eos> This was entirely a student body move?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thank you, Dean.<eos> Do you agree with the way the students handled Imogen's op-ed?<eos> I do.<eos> And if you didn't?
No, because I didn't want to make it seem like it was about us yesterday.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> Well, you should do what's best for you.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes I can't tell what that is.<eos> Well, it usually involves seeing which number is higher.<eos> Yes.<eos> So that didn't end well, did it?<eos> No.<eos> I heard from Lucca, they don't want to settle.<eos> They don't.
I would've said yes.<eos> Yes to what?<eos> There was a young man... in love with me.<eos> Um, why don't we go on the bus, Alicia?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> ♪ Than you. ♪<eos> Did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with FEPA?<eos> - Did you file a discriminatory hiring claim with FEPA?<eos> You know you can't ask me that.<eos> You did, didn't you?
I killed him.<eos> Paul Durrell committed suicide?<eos> I knew he was unstable... he threatened suicide but I left him nonetheless.<eos> But there was no suicide note in the coroner's file.<eos> It was nobody else's business.<eos> I didn't want to shame his memory any further.<eos> I didn't kill the other four.<eos> I swear.<eos> Elizabeth, do you still have the note that he left you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Kitchen.<eos> When was the last time you saw your roommate?<eos> Last night, right here.<eos> That her purse?<eos> Yes. Her wallet, her id, everything is still in it.<eos> Nothing was taken?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Does she have a boyfriend?<eos> - Not right now.<eos> - But she did?
The tears that filled her eyes when you held her down, when you forced yourself into her.<eos> No, please.<eos> Please, no. I'll do anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought no meant yes.<eos> My bad.<eos> You didn't stop when she said no, did you, Will?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't stop.<eos> I didn't.
Never let her go.<eos> The maid or Kensi? Both.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I got it.<eos> Oh, I see you're playing cards.<eos> We're not gonna talk about that.<eos> Listen, so I was thinking maybe, uh, Jack should stay with us tonight.<eos> That is a good idea.<eos> I mean, 'cause our couch doesn't have bullet holes in it.<eos> It does not.

You can't have this two ways here.<eos> I just need to talk to him.<eos> I can tell by the look on your face this is not a social call, Francis.<eos> Good news.<eos> We found out who stole the money. A Mason Reyes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe you know him. And his family.<eos> Well, he's 20, so we can charge him as an adult.<eos> The question is, how do you know him?<eos> I don't, personally.
I'm sorry. If you don't like Korean food, you know...<eos> The other thing is, I'm not into guys.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> Okay.

The first time I was taken from her, I was two-years-old and I was placed in several foster homes until I was around seven when I was finally placed with a loving couple whom weren't able to have children of their own, and I made my first best friend there.<eos> She gave me her Mrs. Beasley doll.<eos> But one night, social workers came and they took me away.<eos> They didn't even let me take my doll.<eos> Wait, so...<eos> Justina's a foster kid?<eos> Justina is Lizzie.<eos> The friend that she told me about was her.<eos> ♪ There is no controlling this ♪ Thanks a lot for telling Zoey that I cheated on you.<eos> I didn't.

I'm with Galavant, fighting for true love and all that?<eos> Galavant, the undead army is turning on us!<eos> I know. They're doing it here, too!<eos> - You can control the dead? - Oh, yes.<eos> Not only control, but make them stronger.<eos> Ha!<eos> Seems Galavant has brought the wrong covered dish to the potluck dinner.<eos> Ha! They're kind of attacking everyone, our men included.<eos> Well, you make a cake, you break a few eggs.<eos> So, how do we do this?

Yeah, sure.<eos> Well, well, well.

If a child lives with ridicule, he learns to hate.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Remember how I was telling you about that guy, whose life you ruined?<eos> You know, how you turned his fiance into a zombie, then cost him his job, killed a bunch of kids that were close to him, kidnapped him, locked him in a freezer and tortured him, before finally stabbing him to death?<eos> Yeah, this is him.<eos> I thought the worst part about this whole thing was forgetting the people I loved, or the people that loved me.<eos> But maybe nobody did.
I was like a praise-oholic.<eos> I thought I was past that, but apparently not.<eos> He made it sound like by not telling you about Drake I was somehow protecting him.<eos> But I don't think that that's really the case.<eos> Do I not praise you enough?<eos> Temporary insanity, that's all it was.<eos> I'm done with old me.<eos> You can trust me with almost anything.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.

- It's good this time.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> You want me to make you a plate?<eos> - I already ate.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> Hey, wait. Before you go...<eos> Aunt Meg called.<eos> We're going to dinner at the inn tomorrow night.<eos> Do we have to go?<eos> Yes, we do.
- Yes.<eos> You would physically be there? Yes.<eos> Can it... be nice?<eos> Well, that's on you.<eos> Let me know by 9:00.<eos> - What if we die before then?<eos> - There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
You said you're roommates.<eos> Damn.<eos> Bitten by my own snake.<eos> So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss. Is that correct?<eos> - That's true.<eos> - Yes. - Chicago.<eos> So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.<eos> I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.<eos> I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.<eos> Who does?
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.<eos> - Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no...<eos> - Uh, it's right in my room. Right here, in the first door.<eos> - Right there.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> - WINSTON: Oh, no, no. - NICK:<eos> Telling the truth works.<eos> SCHMIDT: Yeah, it did.
What is it, Morgan?<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm scared, Pop.<eos> I can't feel anything.<eos> Pop, I'm scared.<eos> Dying is easy.<eos> You know what's hard?<eos> Not being there for your son.<eos> I want to.<eos> I do.
Either they don't want to talk or can't.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> My eyes in the sky.<eos> Two Hornets on the horizon.<eos> Should have visual in less than five.<eos> Private jet is outside restricted airspace, but not for long.<eos> Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn. Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.<eos> We gotta get you to safety.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
Against who?<eos> Those guys. They have a boss.<eos> Yes, of course. Meng Zhou.<eos> Came to see you last night, didn't he?<eos> How... how did you know that?<eos> Meng Zhou was in our police station earlier this morning.<eos> He was pretty ticked to find out about the scam his dead buddies had been running at Willowbrook.<eos> Guess they never told him.<eos> No.<eos> They did.
Yes, I'm sure it will.<eos> _<eos> The Crown's case hinges on the testimony of Nils Jesper. Your former associate.<eos> Alleged associate.<eos> Please don't waste my time with repetition. I asked you here for an update.<eos> Well, they're being vague with details, stalling information.<eos> Which, in your professional opinion means what?<eos> I think they're trying to pull a surprise witness. Someone whose testimony will support Jesper's alleged activities.<eos> I don't know who it is.<eos> I do.
- He's in New Orleans.<eos> - Doubtful.<eos> We only go to New Orleans for crappy booze and Klaus blood.<eos> There's a bar there.<eos> The St. James Infirmary.<eos> It's considered a safe house for supernatural travelers.<eos> Oscar came upon it when he was looking for the Phoenix Stone.<eos> Fine. Just tell him to pack it up, huff it back to Virginia to a pile of bricks called the Armory.<eos> - Did you just say the Armory?<eos> - Yes, I did.
This is what the Armory can provide me.<eos> So will I do whatever it takes for answers?<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> Flag on the play.<eos> Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone.<eos> We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon.<eos> I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
I can't do that, sir.<eos> You can't?<eos> I'd like to resign.<eos> You don't get to resign, Joe.<eos> - You got your film. - Yes.<eos> A film of great importance to the Führer.<eos> Think about what that means, Joe.<eos> Think how proud your father will be.<eos> My father doesn't even know I work for you.<eos> Of course he does.
Wait.<eos> Was this the man you saw?<eos> In the film, he was shot by the Nazis.<eos> He was one of the partisans, but here he's...<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> So this was the man.<eos> You recognize him.<eos> I think so.<eos> I don't know. You don't know.<eos> You don't...
This is pointless, Belle.<eos> Where is Rumplestiltskin?<eos> Look, Gaston, please stop this.<eos> I can't!<eos> Seeing him dead is the only thing I care about anymore.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> You broke into my locker?<eos> Gaston, I want to help you move on.<eos> If you still have this book, it must mean something to you.<eos> Of course it does.
Some dad, huh?<eos> Calista, we need your help.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> You're gonna walk in calmly and talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> Calista and I will go in together.<eos> I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> He wants to talk to you, alone.<eos> 'Course he does.
Kids inhaling it to get high.<eos> Might be where this came from.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> - Thanks, Doc.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
I rather think it was your presence that brightened our days.<eos> Might we join you, ladies?<eos> Oh, I must be going, I'm afraid. I have a business meeting to prepare for.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I seen the same thing with old Mr Wemmick.<eos> Grey, it was, like death.<eos> He lost the leg, of course.<eos> Well, I warned him, did he listen?<eos> They never do, do they?
Go for it.<eos> Watch my hips.<eos> Wow! Yeah!<eos> As pinch hitter, you have to swing the bat.<eos> You can't lose that chance.<eos> You'll try harder next time, right?<eos> I was trying to draw a walk.<eos> You can't be a hero if you get on base like that.<eos> I don't need to be a hero.<eos> You don't?
The real question is, where are you with Emily?<eos> Uh, it's hard to say.<eos> I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.<eos> I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?<eos> No. Never.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine. I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.

I'll have to get back to you.<eos> Okay, fine. Be sure to call me back.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I don't know why I'm fucking surprised.<eos> What's the problem, Tommy?<eos> Milan knows that you followed me to his warehouse the other night.<eos> You just gonna stand there and look stupid or are you gonna be real for a change?<eos> Look, man, you don't understand what I'm trying to...<eos> No, you don't.
You willing to risk my life to get yourself out?<eos> I chose you over Holly.<eos> This time, motherfucker, you need to choose me.<eos> I do.<eos> I choose you, all right?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Ruiz hit me up about that payment.<eos> He ain't never gonna reach his full potential unless we set up a meet, you know, between he and Milan.<eos> You know how that motherfucker is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Tommy...<eos> Ghost...<eos> If we're gonna do this...<eos> Kill Milan... I call the shots.<eos> I'll come up with a plan.<eos> Call you in the morning.<eos> Tommy, I didn't expect to see you back tonight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A few days ago, you asked me if I was one of you.<eos> I did.
What if I took blood from our inmates?<eos> Is there a law that says I cannot?<eos> No.<eos> - I am a public servant.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> You are an accessory to murder.<eos> You have no option but to release me, and you know it.<eos> Well, let me, uh, patch you up at least before you go, huh?<eos> [Gasp] No. Uh, they do not improve your health, I believe.<eos> Shit, Probyn. What does?
Envigado, Olvidos, Los Rastrados... but it was a dead end.<eos> Olvidos.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - A dead junkie turned up about a week ago with Olvidos heroin in her system.<eos> And a hole in her back?<eos> There's been a string of those murders, gory, like some homemade spinal tap voodoo shit.<eos> What's all that got to do with Abby?<eos> Bitch thinks I'm the mole.<eos> Since when have you cared about what Finnerman thinks of you?<eos> - I don't.
And whatever they look like on the surface... they're monsters underneath.<eos> CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 2012<eos> You're ruthless.<eos> World domination cometh.<eos> You get the killer instinct from your parents?<eos> My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
You've killed for the ETU.<eos> Jackson told me we had to, to save people.<eos> - That we needed to stop you.<eos> - What did your parents tell you?<eos> Not much.<eos> Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
Jules' replacement can scour his financials to find out what he's been hiding.<eos> Stephanie Le Guin, meet Agent Briggs, Agent Carroll.<eos> The muscle.<eos> Oh, Miss Congeniality.<eos> Steph's a cryptographer,<eos> Finnerman brought her in to continue working on decoding the Hunter language.<eos> The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez.<eos> This is coming from Regan.<eos> How do we know it's not compromised?<eos> We don't.
You okay?<eos> I can't talk about this on the phone.<eos> Can you please get down here?<eos> It's important I see you now.<eos> Emme, I'm really sorry.<eos> I gotta take care of something.<eos> Just a quick work trip.<eos> I'll see you as soon as I get back.<eos> - Flynn, you don't understand.<eos> - I do.
Hunters molt.<eos> They click.<eos> They have shells.<eos> And they have nuclear weapons.<eos> I think that you,<eos> Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
I called to talk to Max, but I got Caroline's<eos> "my life doesn't suck anymore" podcast.<eos> Well, Sophie, Max isn't here.<eos> She met this really cute guy...<eos> Max already got laid!<eos> That's why I love LA.<eos> Hey, way back in the day, I was all up and down the Strip.<eos> Now I'm excited if I get up and down the step.<eos> Sophie, Max didn't come home last night, but we don't know that she got laid.<eos> Oh, she did...
I went outside in the daytime.<eos> Nina's on her way in.<eos> You know, she's the executive who discovered me at that storytelling show.<eos> I'm running behind, so you need to order me lunch.<eos> I want a kale salad with a side of kale and a kale shake, and tomorrow better book me a kale-onic.<eos> Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Hello.<eos> Hey. How'd you do?<eos> Hey, I fucking won.<eos> I-I-I beat her.<eos> I-I fucking knocked her out.<eos> Ah, damn right you did.<eos> I fucking knew it.<eos> - [Laughs] - I knew you would.<eos> I knew you would do it.<eos> I did.
I'll be fine.<eos> I love boys. I love you boys.<eos> You know that.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Are you ready for your big fight?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You have been on another planet for the entire day.<eos> Ryan is my friend.<eos> I do not like to fight with my friends.<eos> I do not.
Nature-- videogame God.<eos> Hey, Bob. What's happening?<eos> But I made a fucking Miami.<eos> To be honest, it's just porn Eurotrash and at this point, Or at least, that's how I got approached .<eos> It was bloody annoying.<eos> Have you been to Italy?<eos> Yes, I was, but it was-- it was full, too I finished firing their agency, and...<eos> I'll be here.<eos> I'm going to take some meetings.<eos> I kinda sort of-- done.
No, it's not.<eos> See, I train a lot, to treat it like a job.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> You make any money?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> No. But if I get better and I keep winning fights, Then it gets better.<eos> Just fucking say.<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> Good.<eos> Do not.
Well, maybe Dwight just hated Calderon.<eos> He yelled at him when we were in court, ma'am.<eos> What if Calderon was targeted, too?<eos> Marco Calderon is the only outside person besides Simms who had regular contact with Dwight.<eos> [Clears throat] Uh, Detective Sanchez, do you have a second?<eos> Oh. Sure.<eos> Uh, excuse me, Captain, Lieutenant.<eos> So, Calderon might have been one of the loose ends.<eos> Do you believe there are more?<eos> Yes, I do.
You want to leave me?<eos> No.<eos> But I have to. No.<eos> You don't.<eos> Let's go together.<eos> Let me drink first.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Is it strong enough for both of us?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I do.
He was a financier in the City, Teddy Ballard.<eos> He hanged himself when she was 21.<eos> Oh, poor girl.<eos> It's sad how often suicides run in families.<eos> I know.<eos> On that note, shall we head out to the garden?<eos> Come on, James.<eos> James.<eos> James, we need to investigate this death.<eos> No. No, we don't.
So, is that what you were looking for when you went to her house, the accounts?<eos> No, I was looking for the file that she said she had on me from the orphanage.<eos> But if you were responsible for the accounts, she could've denied all knowledge and let you take the blame.<eos> She had your secret.<eos> Perhaps the shame of being found out for who she really was was too much.<eos> No.<eos> She had Jez by the short and curlies.<eos> She would've let him take the fall.<eos> Agatha, not now. You didn't know her, Agatha.<eos> I did.
They are sleeping.<eos> Just shut up<eos> Give me a smooch What...<eos> A smooch... give me a kiss<eos> They'll all wake up!<eos> Shut up you coward<eos> Archie... they'll wake up...<eos> We'll wake them...<eos> They'll wake up!<eos> Please don't
Are you chewing Gutkha?<eos> What no? Your mouth looks full of that shite<eos> You swallowed it or what?<eos> Don't eat shit like that<eos> No, no...<eos> You chew it too? No, of course not<eos> Go spit it out!<eos> For real?<eos> I swear I don't<eos> No... he doesn't... both of us...
Whatever you're involved in, it's not too late.<eos> We can stop it.<eos> We're gonna stay here.<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> The scar is not from Bashir.<eos> I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped?<eos> Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
And your son.<eos> He came early.<eos> He's healthy and strong.<eos> Like his father.<eos> Here, hold him.<eos> I was right about Nolan.<eos> First time for everything, right?<eos> Ah, I'm glad you were.<eos> I like a storybook ending.<eos> Who doesn't?
Follow me.<eos> Come on!<eos> You.<eos> The spare who would be heir.<eos> 'Did you really think you would be king of England?<eos> ' 'you will find that taking a life is an unbearable weight'.<eos> Every second. Every minute.<eos> Every hour. Every day.<eos> ♪ The sickness lies and waits a constant reminder of what you did.<eos> And how you did it.
It's good.<eos> It's so dirty, but...<eos> I... I liked it.<eos> Made me really think about you.<eos> - It did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This woman, she had to explore the world and bang a bunch of dudes to finally find her perfect O.<eos> See, I read it that she had it all along.<eos> She didn't need to go anywhere.<eos> No, she did.

I tell all my patients over 35 to wake up and smell the biological clock.<eos> Want a hit?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> There you are.<eos> I was scared you were hiding from me.<eos> Were you hiding from me?<eos> What is it?<eos> If it's something I did or said...<eos> No, oh... oh, my God, you... you didn't do anything.
I know I just blurted it out.<eos> It's like a got EW-titis or something.<eos> Well, sometimes you need to stretch the truth a little to get what you want.<eos> So I took your advice, left the office, and struck up a conversation with an attractive man. Wonderful.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> How did it go?<eos> We went out for drinks, and he introduced me to the Moscow Mule.<eos> It's a delightful cocktail.<eos> Sounds like you had a nice time.<eos> Yes, I did.
That's not true.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think it is.<eos> I'm never gonna be your first time for anything.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Coffee's ready.<eos> Scrambled okay?<eos> Yes, that would be nice.<eos> I can't believe I slept so late, but then I remembered that we had quite a workout.<eos> Yes, we did.
Thanks.<eos> Can you cover my phone?<eos> I'm gonna go over to his place to celebrate.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Awesome.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you see EW?<eos> I just did.
Yeah, and I bet you were the one that blabbed about Jelly Bean too.<eos> We're just worried about you, that's all.<eos> Yeah, you got a hell of a way of showing it.<eos> Hey. Knock it off.<eos> Look, it sucks to lose somebody, okay?<eos> Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music] I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine.<eos> You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
Didn't we do this once already?<eos> Well, this time, we have a search warrant.<eos> Which way is your laundry room?<eos> Who said I had a laundry room?<eos> I'll find it myself.<eos> And what possible reason would he have to do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Maybe these, uh, these shirts, these shoes here, oh, look at that, these magazines.<eos> I like to read the articles.<eos> Right, don't we all?
Or, what I mean is, I could stay at least until Sebastian is able to join you.<eos> Well, that may be a while, 'cause I've decided I'm not going to be seeing him anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> So... are you ready?<eos> Is Christine okay?<eos> Yeah, she's sleeping like a baby.<eos> Whew, turns out that Aubrey's advice did the trick.<eos> What exactly did you say?<eos> Well, I told her, you know, if she's scared, you just go right up to the closet, and you tell the monster, "If you don't stop, my Dad is gonna put a cap in your butt."<eos> No, you did not, Booth.
We won't know whether the gunshot wound was fatal.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Wow. Oh, my God.<eos> These are incredible.<eos> Each is a piece of my soul.<eos> That's what photography is, Angela.<eos> It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.<eos> Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?<eos> You don't.
He who?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Ms. Warren.<eos> Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.<eos> Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?<eos> Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.<eos> It's a polyester and polyolefin blend, like what you'd find in the trunk of a car.<eos> Angela, now place the victim inside the trunk of a car.<eos> The amount of damage caused by the beating suggests the killer presumed Lola was dead when he placed her in the vehicle.<eos> You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.<eos> Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.<eos> The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?<eos> Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.<eos> I need you.<eos> See you at home.<eos> It's a beautiful thing you've done for them, Booth.<eos> Kenny's done bad things.<eos> He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
FRANCE, THE BATTLE OF THE ARGONNE FOREST 14 OCTOBER, 1918<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> Victory... is right over there.<eos> It's yours for the taking.<eos> Take it from those murdering sons of German bitches.<eos> That nest of vipers is all that stands between you and your loved ones.<eos> You're the murdering son of a bitch.<eos> Patrick, no.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Did you?
Your head is buzzing.<eos> You're probably scared.<eos> My name is Janice.<eos> And I'm not really a nurse.<eos> You have the doctors mystified.<eos> A lot of people don't understand how you did what you did.<eos> It was wrong.<eos> It was necessary.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
Help with what?<eos> I don't know, you tell me.<eos> Nothing to tell.<eos> Look, Deena, I'm not here to lecture you or demand the truth<eos> - of whatever the hell went down...<eos> - Went down with what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just here if you want to talk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't.
Okay.<eos> Rain check.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A few hours ago, the world learned of the atomic bomb and its use against the city of Hiroshima in Japan.<eos> The descriptions of this new weapon's devastating and awesome power stagger the imagination.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> If Truman's hand was forced, then he had to.<eos> He did it.
Yes, but it's what we agreed to do, to help your sister.<eos> Then we shall be free.<eos> Well, that's it. That's me off.<eos> See you when you're back from the tour in... 23 weeks.<eos> - Well, call me if you need anything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You won't, of course.<eos> - You don't need me anymore at all. - Yes, of course I do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Neither of you does.
'cause there were so many bones in there.<eos> Wait, did -- did you also have a --<eos> Oh, don't tell me you didn't feel mine, bro.<eos> That's bullshit, man.<eos> Ugh. Soggy.<eos> I can't get a single fry in my mouth!<eos> Aah! I didn't ask for a beer!<eos> Throwing beers is the only thing that breaks up the monotony.<eos> Owning a boat sucks.<eos> It does.
Jeff Fischer broke into the aquarium and brutally killed a seal, but not just any seal.<eos> This was harpy...<eos> The cutest seal.<eos> I can't hear you!<eos> The prosecution rests, but not before a quick round of high five with this awesome jury!<eos> What's happening, daddy?<eos> That man is on trial because he did a bad thing to a seal.<eos> I like seals.<eos> I don't like that man.<eos> No one does.
I just thought it would be more fun to spend 20 minutes trying to open it with a freaking hammer.<eos> All right, don't sass me.<eos> Give me the hammer.<eos> What's in here, anyway?<eos> Ugh, who can remember?<eos> Old savings bonds?<eos> Insurance policy?<eos> It's just one stupid piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is my life.<eos> Well, you don't have to sort through all this stuff now.<eos> Yes, I do.
You're out of options, Laurent.<eos> It's over.<eos> Your prison sentence goes to life if Elmslie dies.<eos> I can get you a deal if you testify against the former members of Karume's army.<eos> What are you offering?<eos> I'll get you five years, out in two.<eos> It's a good deal.<eos> I would take it.<eos> I'd put the gun down. Put it down.<eos> Do it!
It's a good deal.<eos> I would take it.<eos> I'd put the gun down. Put it down.<eos> Do it!<eos> Put it down.<eos> Oh, I thought you were smarter than that. What are you talking about?<eos> You aided and abetted a known terrorist and mass murderer.<eos> Not to mention fraud charges.<eos> I have no authority to cut you a deal.<eos> I do.
I had to... convince him that I believed every crazy word coming out of his mouth, just to get him to fly me back.<eos> He is dangerous, okay?<eos> He's like a fucking nuclear bomb, bouncing all over the Earth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Without Janice, it's only a matter of time before he blows.<eos> - We got to stop him.<eos> - No, Walker, Morrison.<eos> No, Morrison doesn't exist.<eos> - I've looked...<eos> - The fuck he doesn't!
It is Morrison.<eos> It is not Supershock.<eos> It is Morrison.<eos> Supershock?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seizure boy here... thinks that...<eos> - Is sure.<eos> - Is sure, is sure that Supershock is insane, and he killed the Senator, because someone wrote a... "To whom it may concern" letter.<eos> Because Janice wrote it.<eos> She did.
but two domes.<eos> The inner dome will serve as support for the outer dome.<eos> Ingenious<eos> The first 46 feet will be constructed in stone.<eos> Then we will use lighter materials either brick or sponge-stone laid in a herringbone pattern.<eos> So each brick supports the others.<eos> A flying buttress imbedded in the dome itself.<eos> Precisely.<eos> How do you know it will hold?<eos> I don't.
You can keep her.<eos> She's not worth it.<eos> It's just a scratch.<eos> It will heal.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You have nothing to be sorry for.<eos> I knew why you were sent here.<eos> It wasn't your choice. What else could you do?<eos> How did you know I wouldn't betray you?<eos> I didn't.
You have to dig her up.<eos> No way!<eos> She'll flame to life underground, suffocate... poof.<eos> Final life over.<eos> Hunter's problem solved.<eos> Rayna can't die again.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> The wounds from her sword... It's linked her to her victims.<eos> If Rayna dies one last time...<eos> So does Stefan.
Looking for a bottle to celebrate?<eos> I gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Got your text.<eos> I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.<eos> Actually, my exact message read:<eos> "She's taken care of."<eos> Yeah, she's taken care of.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, so you didn't kill her?<eos> I did.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You like beating up women, Bug?<eos> Girl you put in the hospital last week...<eos> She seems to think you do.<eos> Thought you enjoyed it.<eos> She should've gave it up.<eos> Blood on the shotgun we found in your stolen squad is a match for Franklin Haynes.<eos> Sounds like you know everything.<eos> I don't.
I don't understand.<eos> I'm going on alone.<eos> You need to go home and sort out your life.<eos> No, I'm coming with you.<eos> I can't be responsible for you, OK?<eos> It's too bloody dangerous.<eos> But...<eos> You're not cut out for it, OK?<eos> You've got no idea what it's like being on the run.<eos> What, and you do?
That'll be 10 grand. Deposit.<eos> Another 50K at the other end, in Mossman.<eos> 60K?<eos> Laurie only charged me three 20 years ago.<eos> Blame 9/11.<eos> It's a different world.<eos> I can do them on the cheap for you.<eos> 10K apiece. But they won't get you through Immigration.<eos> Oh, that's OK. We don't need to get through Immigration.<eos> Actually, we do.
Um, If I win...<eos> When you win.<eos> I want to know who's behind all of this.<eos> This has never happened to me before.<eos> Ripped Corrected By mstoll<eos> We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
You get enough sleep?<eos> Not really. Why not?<eos> Rosalee told me that Adalind is a Hexenbiest again.<eos> What? It happened when I was in Germany with Monroe.<eos> Rosalee told Adalind to tell me, but she did not.<eos> Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dixon was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
Mr. Johnson told us you threatened his son in court.<eos> I'm sure you can understand the emotional state of Jin at that time.<eos> Just as you understand Dennis Johnson's state today.<eos> We still need to follow up.<eos> Now, one of the boys you threatened was murdered.<eos> Okay. This is crazy.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Losing our son destroyed our life.<eos> You don't feel the same after that.<eos> Nothing does.
- I don't care.<eos> - You will.<eos> Get away from my daughter.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> You okay?<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Not for Jack.<eos> Not in time.<eos> Sorry I ruined your birthday.<eos> You didn't.
Callie, do you have any proof Justina Marks is employed by Arbiter?<eos> No comment.<eos> Is it true you made these false allegations because she found out you were having sex with your foster brother, Brandon Foster?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> Yours.<eos> Or it will be after you sign the lease.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> I do.
addicts afraid to believe the truth... that there is no order, there's no power, that all religions are just metastasizing mind worms meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that want to run us.<eos> All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly written sci-fi franchise.<eos> If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours?<eos> People think their worship's some key to happiness.<eos> That's just how he owns you.<eos> Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality.<eos> So fuck God.<eos> He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.<eos> Please tell me I didn't say all of that out loud.<eos> Shit. I did.
Okay, well, find him.<eos> We need to know how he fits into all this.<eos> You got it.<eos> Our, uh, presence is requested.<eos> We found a Deep Web URL buried in the code on the tablet.<eos> NowTheGamesBegin.mist.<eos> This is where it led us.<eos> We have no idea what the answer is.<eos> We don't even have a question.<eos> I do.
Now my phone is tapped.<eos> Anytime I make phone calls, I hear interference, voices.<eos> I mean, who are we protecting?<eos> Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?<eos> Part of our agreement was that you would not ask any questions.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> I know someone is watching me. I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.<eos> You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days...<eos> Me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.<eos> We had that.<eos> But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.<eos> When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?<eos> Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,<eos> Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.<eos> I really don't.
"Oh, we kind of all slept with each other<eos> "and hate each other right now.<eos> And that is largely my fault."<eos> Really good to see you again, Q, but, um, why am I looking at the Hedgebitch who tried to kill you?<eos> We worked it out.<eos> I wouldn't be here without her, so...<eos> I'm here.<eos> You don't have to like me.<eos> Oh, don't you worry.<eos> We don't.
In real life, for every one guy, there are a billion people who aren't.<eos> Almost none of us are the one.<eos> Ember said--<eos> Ember is a little out of touch, I think.<eos> You're a better Magician.<eos> And you're a better person.<eos> And I think that if he'd met you, he wouldn't be so sure that it's me.<eos> But you're the one that they say shows up every single time, it's you.<eos> I want to be the one.<eos> I do.
She was a grown-ass woman.<eos> Twenty-five.<eos> She started with me right after my priest got sent away.<eos> She did the same shit to me that he did.<eos> I'd only known a man.<eos> You know what that is.<eos> I thought I was all fucked up in the head.<eos> I did not want to be gay.<eos> Do you get that, Ray?<eos> Do you?
We'll be at the harbor in an hour.<eos> Yeah. His office.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> - Hey, Abs.<eos> - Hey. Remember when we went out to the hot springs in Indio?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> We got caught fucking in the hot tub, and that guy got really mad.<eos> I do.
Belikov runs your whole operation.<eos> Look, I didn't even know.<eos> Cops don't know anything either.<eos> Muncie's gone.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit? - Do they?<eos> - My son did.
I'm sorry, Abs.<eos> I'm so fucking sorry.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't care about any of it... not the house or the money.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
Even in ugly things, I think you see beauty.<eos> Am I beautiful to you?<eos> No, don't look away.<eos> Am I ugly?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.
No, don't look away.<eos> Am I ugly?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was born of the virgin Mary, suffered death and was buried, rose again from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
That's standard. Ask anybody.<eos> It's all right if you don't have it on you.<eos> I know you're good for it.<eos> Hey, Ray?<eos> You think there's a reason that we're working together?<eos> No.<eos> I do.<eos> I think we're the instruments for each other's enlightenment, man.<eos> In here. Fifteen minutes, Donovan.<eos> How you doing?
It's jail...<eos> A record.<eos> Dad went to juvie.<eos> Didn't hurt him.<eos> Don't be a smartass.<eos> He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do. - No, we don't.
You want your cut or not?<eos> Give it to Bunch.<eos> He's gonna need it for his fucking lawyers.<eos> Ray.<eos> It was just a situation, you know.<eos> I stole the money from him.<eos> He stole it back from us.<eos> He got his four million from the insurance, and I just wanted mine.<eos> No one needed to get hurt.<eos> But they always do, don't they, Mick?
You know it's true.<eos> We should go... me, you, and Maria.<eos> Once Ray's back... once I know Abby and the kids are safe...<eos> Once I know... we'll fucking leave.<eos> For good?<eos> It ain't pretty.<eos> She climbed into the bathtub fucking high on drugs and passed out.<eos> There but for the grace of God, you know?<eos> She didn't mean to kill herself, you know?<eos> But she did.
All right.<eos> You're too big to spar with Hector.<eos> Terry, that's garbage.<eos> I did Ray's dirty work for y'all.<eos> I took out Joxy Maguire. Got Hector that rematch.<eos> I deserve to be more than just a janitor.<eos> I don't wanna hear that shit.<eos> You know what, Terry, I don't think you want to know<eos> - what's really going on.<eos> - No, I don't.
What's that for? For impersonating an NYPD officer.<eos> All cell carriers have a law enforcement hotline.<eos> Instead of hacking the carrier, if the situation's urgent enough, you can just ask them to track a blocked call for you.<eos> [tense music]<eos> Is it done?<eos> Not yet... need a few minutes for the spoof fax to go through.<eos> It needs to propagate through their system.<eos> No one in the world uses fax anymore except cops.<eos> Half of me wants it to be him.<eos> Half of me doesn't.
It's hard to be a savior when no on wants you to save them.<eos> I gave the vial of powder to Dorothy.<eos> We attack at first light.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> That doesn't sound like a very convincing battle cry.<eos> Ruby, what's going on?<eos> When we were on our trek, Dorothy asked me what I've been looking for this whole time.<eos> And I told her that didn't know.<eos> Well, do you?
Ruby, you can do this.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wolfie?<eos> Kansas.<eos> You left without saying anything.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.
- Crazy.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go on.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Seven to three.<eos> - What's that?<eos> That's how many times you've talked about Henry and how many times you've talked about me or us during dinner.<eos> What are you doing counting?<eos> It's just that I really made an effort tonight.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Mm.<eos> What happened?<eos> Witness saw it parked here last night.<eos> It was still here this morning so he had a look.<eos> Driver's shot.<eos> - Hassan El-Sayed?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That's why we got it.<eos> - You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.
And it is not only Simcoe.<eos> This business with Abraham Woodhull...<eos> I feel like I'm besieged on two sides, like Odysseus trying to steer between Scylla and Charybdis.<eos> That's from Homer, isn't it?<eos> Indeed.<eos> They were a pair of sea monsters, one a six-headed giant and the other a massive whirlpool.<eos> They guarded two sides of a narrow strait.<eos> To avoid one, sailors would have to sail too close by the other.<eos> So how did Odysseus prevail?<eos> He didn't.
You better get that bloody thing open.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Okay. Front door.<eos> Good.<eos> Wait.<eos> Get into the reception right now. Hide in the reception.<eos> We have no control over it all.<eos> So whatever destiny that you think or believe you have or have led...<eos> Mike.<eos> What do we do?
And by "anyone" you mean Paul, I take it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So now that we've bonded, do you want to tell me what's been troubling Rebecca?<eos> I thought you had to get to work.<eos> Respect her wishes?<eos> What?<eos> Hey! If my daughter is having sex, I should be the first to know!<eos> Have you any idea how dodgy that sounds?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - No. I don't.
She's very happy in her new lodgings.<eos> She asked me to tell you how grateful she is.<eos> How's the baby?<eos> Still has a cough but Mrs Ashdown thinks now they are out of the city, it will get better.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I used to fancy myself a good judge of men, but I can't think of many people who would do what you did for a stranger.<eos> I didn't do it for her.<eos> I suppose you want something in return.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Miss Skerrett, I do.
Until I saw what was on it.<eos> I know that's me, but I swear it wasn't me.<eos> I would never hurt Staci.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I was at a dinner the entire time.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.

I can see inside your heart.<eos> Feel the love you feel, except...<eos> It's cloaked in shame.<eos> When it comes to this...<eos> You can't help yourself.<eos> So why fight it?<eos> Just give in.<eos> Why hurt Melissa?<eos> She only wanted to save her marriage.<eos> They all do.
You've done a great job getting us to here, but it's only a matter of time before the cops put an ID to that.<eos> You go home.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll be in touch.<eos> Can I open the window?<eos> No.<eos> Do you have Ventolin?<eos> No.<eos> I get asthma... when I get too hot.<eos> No, you don't, Chelsea.
David, look.<eos> I've found Harry.<eos> I thought we'd left you behind.<eos> We did leave him behind, Mum.<eos> No, no, I've... I've found...<eos> Mum?<eos> Where's Harry?<eos> He was... he was just here.<eos> We lost Harry, Mum.<eos> We did.
Do you even want to know what's on the chip?<eos> - No.<eos> - All of the faces Sin Rostro changed.<eos> But I gave that to Nadine to give to Rose.<eos> My mother says Rose doesn't have it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Nadine must not have given it to her.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you, away from your partner.<eos> 'Cause we probably broke some laws trying to get Mateo back.<eos> You didn't. I did.
- Mrs. Baker...<eos> - You know how I feel.<eos> But this is very promising.<eos> A new radioimmunotherapy drug.<eos> Very similar to Tositumomab, which you've done before, but this works by...<eos> Dr. Halstead, you're not listening to me.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I've tried everything.<eos> You have nothing to lose.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not the one auditioning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's something that represents my unique brand of thinking.<eos> When I fly, I like luggage fees.<eos> Me too.<eos> Why should us carry-on folk have to foot the bill for those morons who don't know how to pack? !<eos> Three weeks, I went from Edinburgh to Warsaw on two pairs of pants and a tam-o'-shanter.<eos> I'm falling asleep.<eos> - I love naps!<eos> - Who doesn't?
Well, your husband, who couldn't plan anything romantic with a gun to his head, may have pulled off two promposals at once.<eos> - Hey. Do you have any idea who put that note in my locker asking me to be a part of this thing?<eos> Oh, yeah, it was my uncle.<eos> It's pretty clever how he turned out the lights.<eos> I said, "Turned out the lights"!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh! That's so sweet.<eos> I... And I can't believe I'm finally going to prom.<eos> I can't believe I finally have a happy memory in a high-school gym.<eos> - Joe did that to you?
I don't know these people, either.<eos> Let's go. Excuse me.<eos> Pardon us.<eos> I'm Haley.<eos> Pleasure. I'm a massive fraud.<eos> Sounds like you need a drink.<eos> I'm not sure that's a good idea.<eos> I used to have something of a --<eos> Oh, come on. I feel weird drinking alone.<eos> I don't.
If I'm being honest, I skimmed that part.<eos> Again!<eos> You ready for me?<eos> I believe I've Googled everything I need to know.<eos> So, let's get started.<eos> This is California.<eos> Lake Superior is here, all the way across --<eos> Are you trying to take off my shoe?<eos> I thought you wanted to show me things.<eos> I do.
Very nice to meet you.<eos> We are both local entrepreneurs, as you are.<eos> Uh, we co-own the bar up the street, and there is a business situation that we would like<eos> - Yeah, your stupid valet is taking all the spots in front of our bar, and it's time for it to come to an end.<eos> It's not sittin' well with us folks over at the Griffin.<eos> What's a griffin?<eos> What is... wait, what is the Griffin?<eos> The Griffin is the name of the bar that we own together, you buffoon.<eos> - You don't know the name of our bar?<eos> - Why don't we...
If you like, you could watch me as I walk away. - Huh?<eos> - I'll pass.<eos> Admit it, you miss being my partner.<eos> Carter, this is Agent Murray and Agent Weiss.<eos> - They're here regarding...<eos> - The airport heist. I'm way ahead of you, already read the reports.<eos> The crime took place on US soil so we're not obligated to include the Chinese in our investigation.<eos> But as a courtesy, the bureau is allowing a detective from Hong Kong to... consult.<eos> We don't have time to look after a Chinese cop.<eos> - But you do.
And now you want back in his life?<eos> - I need to see him.<eos> - I can't help you.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> He's being hunted by the NSA.<eos> Because he's brilliant.<eos> And they want to exploit his work.<eos> No, because he's a killer.<eos> He killed three people.<eos> Actually, I do.
You knew!<eos> "Only your shadow's left with me."<eos> "All you left for me is loneliness."<eos> "There's nothing..<eos> "Where do I go.."<eos> ".. I see no destination."<eos> "You don't ask my condition."<eos> "I think about you."<eos> "I can't forget the past moments, listen to me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"
"All you left for me is loneliness."<eos> "There's nothing..<eos> "Where do I go.."<eos> ".. I see no destination."<eos> "You don't ask my condition."<eos> "I think about you."<eos> "I can't forget the past moments, listen to me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"<eos> "My tears prick me."<eos> "What do I do?" "What do I do?"
- than it is.<eos> - I'd feel more comfortable with a greenlight<eos> - from her doctor.<eos> - Sheriff.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - OK?<eos> I want to help.<eos> - Well, I'll swing by and make sure that cat of yours is fed.<eos> She doesn't really like men.<eos> Well, who does?
I'll answer whatever, OK?<eos> Just put my necklace back on me, please.<eos> On second thought, you're not really in a position to do any bargaining, are you?<eos> OK, look, we just need the entrance to your old bootlegging tunnels, that's it.<eos> Let's say I was willing to help you.<eos> And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
- from working so hard.<eos> - After party at Rowlf's. No plus-ones.<eos> This is my time.<eos> Ooh, that sounds like fun, Uncle Kermit!<eos> Uh, listen, how about we go play laser tag instead?<eos> - Oh, that sounds great!<eos> - Good. Hey, guys, you want to come play laser tag?<eos> No, no, no, Robin.<eos> Uh, they're all busy and have fulfilling lives!<eos> Well, I don't.
Ooh. Maybe it's that knob to the clock on the stove?<eos> No.<eos> Is it that thing from the other time?<eos> Mm, might be.<eos> I'd hate to think there were two of them.<eos> Remember when we used to talk about movies and politics?<eos> Mm. Well, the Ax-man is rockin' it on all cylinders.<eos> My boss loves me.<eos> I thought you said he hated you.<eos> He did.
The piece!<eos> I know what it goes to.<eos> It's the rubber-gaskety-thing that holds the dryer door shut.<eos> See?<eos> It goes right there.<eos> Ah! Now we don't have to use that stupid broomstick.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> We always have so many random pieces.<eos> We never know what they go to.<eos> But this time, we did it.
No more questions.<eos> - Okay, next.<eos> - Um, Agent Dunst, you're technically with the FBI but also serve on TAPS... the Technology Allied Protection Service task force,<eos> - is that correct?<eos> - It is, although I would not call myself technically with the FBI.<eos> Does the FBI have a steering committee, sir?<eos> - A...<eos> - Steering committee.<eos> - No.<eos> - Does the
What, do you have some kind of list?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> No.<eos> Where do you want me to start?<eos> I think you've already started. A homeless program that produces nothing but statistics and leaves it to the police to play the villain...<eos> Commissioner, that's enough.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, Frank, do you remember why I invited you up here?<eos> You know,<eos> I don't.
I saw you three days ago.<eos> I saw you three days ago at a bungalow.<eos> - Do you remember the bungalow?<eos> - None of it matters.<eos> Do you remember what you said at the bungalow?<eos> - None of that matters.<eos> - Said there was a storm - and something hit my head. - It was a long time ago for me.<eos> How severe was that injury?<eos> Did they induce a coma?<eos> - No, they did not.
E-plus.<eos> E-plus!<eos> Actually, she got perfect grades across the board.<eos> This calls for a celebration.<eos> Taking her out for ice cream after dinner.<eos> What is it?<eos> A body was found in the Potomac.<eos> It's being brought to the lab.<eos> Well, that's not good, because that means the local PD moved the victim from the crime scene, and I know how much you hate that.<eos> I do.
Oh, give it to me.<eos> Just tell me where I need to poke.<eos> Go down.<eos> The femoral artery runs down the inside of his leg, from the kneecap to the groin.<eos> Time out.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
This wasn't a hit, it was a robbery.<eos> The question is: what was this guy carrying inside of his body... that was worth taking out a whole room full of people?<eos> We weren't supposed to meet for another 72 hours.<eos> Yeah, well, couldn't wait.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
I hate them.<eos> They are ruining my life.<eos> I wish that they would both just die.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Don't they see?<eos> Don't they even see what they're doing to me?<eos> They don't see it.<eos> They never have.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I really do.
Now, follow me.<eos> I want to leave one set of footprints.<eos> That is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.<eos> Oh, hello, old friend.<eos> Funny seeing you here.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Almost audition time.<eos> - Huh? You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?<eos> You didn't mean that, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
All right, get 'em out of here.<eos> We'll secure the area.<eos> Uh, you sure you two can handle an empty apartment?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You heard him, Ramirez.<eos> Housekeeping will take it from here.<eos> Put some mints on the pillow.<eos> You know, I am getting a little sick of Seely always acting like he's better than us.<eos> I mean, just 'cause you get a commendation from the mayor and back-to-back marksmanship awards doesn't mean you're a better cop.<eos> It kind of does.
I don't know.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> That'll be all, Baker.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm just saying, that's sort of what you signed up for.<eos> Babysitting punks like Marcus?<eos> Mentoring rookies, like me, and yeah, some like Marcus.<eos> Most rookies have a sense of respect for the job.<eos> You did.<eos> Well... maybe Marcus does, too, in his own way.
What are we supposed to do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is our baby is calling on the other side of that door.<eos> Don't hang up! Don't hang up! Don't hang up!<eos> Hello? Hello?<eos> No, Vince, we do not need anything from Costco.<eos> Ten years on the job.<eos> I never had to kick in a door until it was my own.<eos> Does that ankle look swollen to you?<eos> They both do.
And I'm still gonna get my future.<eos> So you're not taking the scar?<eos> Relax, I have a good plan.<eos> Answer the question, Damon.<eos> Stefan, listen...<eos> Say it!<eos> I want to hear you say it.<eos> You're not taking the scar.<eos> I have a plan!<eos> You always do.
Hey, Brad, honey, get ready to grab a screenshot.<eos> You're gonna want this.<eos> Bonnie, wait.<eos> Wait?<eos> Do you have any idea how long it took to me to find the right angle?<eos> Bonnie, you know how I... that it just wasn't...<eos> I met someone.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It sounded like you said you met someone.<eos> I did.
That's it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Got it.<eos> Oh, we kissed.<eos> Did he mention that?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Well, we did.<eos> Wait, is that what this is about?<eos> Do you think that I want to be with him?<eos> Well, do you?
We don't have much time, so listen to me carefully.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> I'm picking up the anomaly again.<eos> Find the source.<eos> You have a sister.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> Um, Cameron, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, any one of them could have wanted Anna out of their way.<eos> My parents had another daughter?<eos> Your father did with his first wife, Elizabeth.
So, you really did need them.<eos> It wasn't just an excuse to see me?<eos> Is there a good answer to that question?<eos> Yes, I signed them out.<eos> That would be agency protocol.<eos> But it was just your name in the log, not mine.<eos> Is this going where I think it's going?<eos> Look, I... I don't want you to feel compromised.<eos> Good.<eos> Neither do I.
Somebody like Steven Frost.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I'm afraid that's a bit above my pay grade, Robert.<eos> No, he fits the profile, you know?<eos> - Long career. - Uh-huh.<eos> Brought us out of the Cold War, strong ties to the China, managed to stay friends with Germany even after the NSA shit.<eos> Now the Shaw leaks.<eos> Well, sounds to me like someone sees an opening.<eos> Yeah, Chris.<eos> I do.
Time of death... 14:21.<eos> Balloon valvuloplasty will stabilize the valve and allow us to do the transplant.<eos> It's only a stopgap.<eos> In a month we're back at square one needing to replace the valve, only now the patient's fresh off a transplant.<eos> Then we open him up, replace the aortic valve, and do the transplant afterwards.<eos> I don't want him open that long.<eos> Invites a whole host of complications.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about this?<eos> We do the valve replacement and the lung transplant at the same time.
It was cutting off the oxygen to his brain.<eos> It's why he fell.<eos> Wow. But they did an angioplasty, and it sounds like it went well.<eos> He got out about an hour ago.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
Look, if you don't... If you want to leave, I get it.<eos> But if you want to help me...<eos> I'm looking for pretty much anything with "barbital" in the name.<eos> Yeah. This will work?<eos> It has to.<eos> Okay. After I do this, go get the doc and tell her to, um...<eos> Tell her to bring me back, if she can.<eos> If not... no hard feelings, okay?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
We need to find out when Oswald starts talking about General Walker and who he starts talking about him to.<eos> Lee is back.<eos> That's George de Mohrenschildt.<eos> He's CIA.<eos> This might be the start of the whole thing.<eos> General Walker. I have something to say!<eos> Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas?<eos> I didn't really take to the city.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does.
I remember you.<eos> I knew I'd see you again.<eos> I thought you'd be fucking old.<eos> You an angel?<eos> No.<eos> I just... when did... When did everything change?<eos> Just answer me... answer me one thing. What...<eos> Was John F. Kennedy reelected in 1964?<eos> What the fuck you want to know about Kennedy for?<eos> I just do.
For a studio?<eos> - That's insane... if buyers aren't lining up.<eos> That is why I have you.<eos> All those contacts and famous names you mentioned during your interview?<eos> You should have no problem.<eos> So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
- Takes?<eos> - Yeah, he just goes- He takes out of the register at the end of the day, he keeps what he needs and then he takes the rest to the bank.<eos> - Okay. How much did he take this week?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Excuse me. - Excuse you what?<eos> - I've just been informed that you help yourself to the company profits at your own discretion.<eos> So would you mind telling me how much you paid yourself this week?<eos> - Yes, I would mind, very much.<eos> - Okay, well, I need to know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Have a seat, please!<eos> Uh, we'll just come back another time.<eos> See? There's no one out here.<eos> Ready?<eos> How often do our parents smoke pot?<eos> All the time.<eos> When did that start?<eos> I don't think it ever really stopped.<eos> Um, maybe they cut back when we were born, but ever since you left, they just totally don't care, and with all my stuff and Tricia...<eos> Well, you don't, do you?
If my kid ran away after I tried to off myself...<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Can you see anything behind those things?<eos> Barely, but yeah.<eos> Why don't you take them off?<eos> It's nighttime, anyway.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather not.<eos> I dare you to take them off.<eos> You don't wanna see it. It's not...<eos> Maybe I do.
_<eos> Oh, yeah, well, you know what?<eos> I'll take it. Yeah.<eos> Oh, be right back. It's Rafael.<eos> He was meeting his brother.<eos> Sorry. Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
- The new Angelique Harper?<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> And a hardcover, how decadent!<eos> Υou know me... Living large.<eos> And this is good. I can look at her without cringing.<eos> Ah, yes, you'll recall this happened last year.<eos> Even my masseuse has a manuscript.<eos> - Oh, no, no, I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> Well, I-I do...
Rafael realized it wasn't in fact all out of his control.<eos> There was one thing he could do.<eos> I want to help you find my mother.<eos> - You guys are working together.<eos> - Yes, but... look, that's obviously privileged.<eos> I didn't want you to go chasing after him.<eos> I wasn't gonna go chasing after him.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> I know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
We're having family dinner. Are you in?<eos> I've got some time.<eos> You had me at Tequila.<eos> Yes!<eos> Vamanos!<eos> This is happening.<eos> You can tell us everything about Mark.<eos> By everything, I mean everything about Mark.<eos> I want all the details.<eos> I, however, do not.
- Today it's just me and you.<eos> Mom and Luca are at grandma's for a bit.<eos> She did it to give you some breathing space.<eos> - To help you.<eos> - She could've stayed.<eos> It makes no difference.<eos> You're still a kid, things are more complicated for adults.<eos> Maybe mom thinks I'm a failure.<eos> Maybe you do too.<eos> I don't, dad.
Refreshing.<eos> Where were you this morning between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m.?<eos> At my house.<eos> Why?<eos> What's this all about?<eos> The Secretary of the Navy's daughter has been abducted.<eos> My God.<eos> That's awful.<eos> And you think I had something to do with it?<eos> Did you?
He was in New York. Meg lied.<eos> Why do you think she lied?<eos> You know what?<eos> To me, it sounds personal.<eos> I think you'd better talk to her.<eos> I think there was somebody in that house, not Alec Moros, somebody else.<eos> Danny.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I thought you didn't know where Danny was.<eos> I didn't.
Look, not for nothing, Sarge, but we're on the clock here.<eos> We're talking about a missing kid. Yeah?<eos> Yeah. You think I should be taking notes?<eos> No offense, okay?<eos> Just keep us posted on the interviews, Sarge.<eos> Stepping out of line isn't gonna bring Matthew back any faster.<eos> I didn't want anything to do with this case to begin with.<eos> Oh, now it's my fault?<eos> I didn't say it was your fault.<eos> No, actually, you just kind of did.
Wow.<eos> Are you okay, Seol?<eos> I ended up recording it so if I show this file and the pictures, he won't be able to do anything.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> You are finally free.<eos> It could become a problem that I put up those posts.<eos> Now we'll both go down together.<eos> Anyway, I have all the evidence, so it's done.<eos> Young Gon is the one who started stalking and writing posts first.<eos> He did it all first.
A chambermaid of Anne's claimed to have seen<eos> Anne and her brother George... together.<eos> Wait, a chambermaid said this?<eos> Anne's night maid.<eos> But he knew that no one would believe it unless it came from someone like me, a close friend to Anne.<eos> And so he turned the screws on my family.<eos> Threats... and promises.<eos> After the trial, Henry awarded me the Boleyn family lands.<eos> And Henry knew the chambermaid's story was a lie.<eos> Of course he did.
I know I can't imagine what prison must do to one's soul.<eos> But I do know this, the love you felt for Greer, a love like that doesn't just disappear.<eos> Not completely.<eos> There is always an ember remaining.<eos> Look deep in your heart for that ember, I beg you.<eos> For her sake and yours. I'm sorry for my behavior just now.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> That's quite all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.

- Fuck your mother.<eos> - Whoa, oh, oh, in other words,<eos> - fuck your grandmother?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Fuck my grandmother.<eos> - Is this all right?<eos> - Um, yeah.<eos> I don't usually go to bars.<eos> - Oh? Well, I do.<eos> So... Yeah, whatever, I do.
- Well, I had a good time there, so...<eos> - Good.<eos> Hey, uh, if I tell you something, can you keep it to yourself?<eos> - Yeah, from who?<eos> - Particularly your cousin Brenda, who I know you're close to.<eos> - Okay, sure.<eos> - So your Aunt Sylvia, um...<eos> - she has breast cancer.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - You do?
- Oh, of course I was drinking at work.<eos> But ever since they put in the new rules, I bring my own booze.<eos> I can't lose my job, Jane.<eos> Busboy Ben will definitely go back to his girlfriend if I'm not around.<eos> Okay. Calm down.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> If you didn't do it, then you're not losing your job.<eos> I have to go to work.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.
From one angry baby mama to another.<eos> Yup, this is gonna be fun.<eos> Hey, Mr. Sweetface, do you like your first swim lesson?<eos> Okay, swim parents, so for the first five minutes, we're just gonna get our babies - used to the water, all right?<eos> - Five minutes... that's certainly a lot longer than you lasted at lunch.<eos> Are we seriously gonna do this now?<eos> We were supposed to do it yesterday but you didn't even try.<eos> So if you want, you can blow bubbles...<eos> I did try. I showed up.<eos> You didn't.
You do know that a defendant who escaped from prison is probably gonna be somebody that a jury finds hard to trust, you know? Kind of, kind of destroys his credibility a bit.<eos> Yeah, so that's why it's really important you make sure it doesn't get brought up while we're in court.<eos> Only way for that to happen is keep him off the stand.<eos> Can you do me a favor and tell him that, please?<eos> look, i-if you don't testify, the jury will only hear facts pertaining to this case.<eos> As far as the court of law is concerned, any crime you committed in the past has no relevance.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I have to testify.<eos> No, you don't. No.<eos> Yes, I do!
These misfortunes have absolutely nothing to do with you.<eos> There is no curse.<eos> You're quite convincing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now go and get dry before you catch your death.<eos> - Peter's not here.<eos> - It's you I've come to see.<eos> Do you remember Clarity Winlove?<eos> No.<eos> - No, I don't.
Let us in!<eos> Wait here. Please!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - Really?<eos> There's no-one there.<eos> Help me!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Harriet!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Do something!
She's pretty amazing.<eos> Look, Norman, there's something that I need to tell you.<eos> You and Emma.<eos> Something happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dylan, I'm... I'm glad.<eos> You are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I get it, the... the two of you.<eos> I-I really do.
I'm sorry, Norman.<eos> You know I love you, don't you?<eos> I know, Daddy.<eos> I know, Daddy.<eos> It's okay, Norman.<eos> Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
We're not gonna get tired of investigating this and shove it in some drawer.<eos> Now, who else is involved?<eos> Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You can do that.<eos> You can keep clicking your heels, hoping this goes away.<eos> But we already got enough to ring you and Jesse up for the murder of Noah Johnson.<eos> "We"?<eos> What's up with this "we"?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The hell you don't.
- You remembered all that?<eos> - Hey, I was the one awake in criminal procedure.<eos> - I was awake.<eos> - No, you were not.<eos> You were always... drunk, lolling around.<eos> That is so not true.<eos> And I've never lolled in my life.<eos> Okay. Tell me the name of our professor.<eos> Oh, come on, you don't remember his name.<eos> I do.
You take the plea, you don't spend one day in jail.<eos> My career will be over.<eos> I think it's over anyway, isn't it?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna take the deal.<eos> But I need one more favor.<eos> I'll announce tomorrow.<eos> Stand by my side.<eos> Sure.<eos> What do I do now?
- Guys, hey.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Pierce.<eos> - Deal with it.<eos> - Morning, Mom. - Yes!<eos> - Okay, I'm a memory.<eos> Make your lunches!<eos> Have a good day at school, and I love... all of you.<eos> I didn't have the heart to tell her it was Saturday.<eos> I never did.
- Another one there.<eos> - What? You need a vertical mattress stitch with an incision like that.<eos> Don't get sloppy on me.<eos> I'm on hour 27.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No one cares, freshman.<eos> We're not gonna talk about last night?<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Oh, you're acting like I attacked you.<eos> Because you did.
Don't hold it against me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I'm sorry that I did before.<eos> Some things take a little time.<eos> Well, part of it was your friend. - Nick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's a Grimm.<eos> We're not exactly taught to trust them.<eos> Does he know what's going on between us?<eos> He does.
So fast.<eos> They are coming at me so fast. They're like a bullet.<eos> And all of sudden, I realize,<eos> "If I jump on them, I will kill them."<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> So, I jump out of the way.<eos> And lucky there was no cars coming. But Don, oh!<eos> He said a funny, funny thing.<eos> You remember it? No.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
I suppose I do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What if we couldn't get in this way?<eos> You've already done the hard part.<eos> No.<eos> The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
I got it!<eos> Do they know where their son is?<eos> No idea.<eos> Jake's cell phone's off.<eos> They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
Hack the Department of Corrections?<eos> That's a good look for you.<eos> Abby...<eos> I told you to go home.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> And miss an all-nighter?<eos> I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay. You said you had something.<eos> I do.
You have to let me talk to Kayla. Please.<eos> Kayla, you're not safe.<eos> Her life is in danger.<eos> You have to listen to me right now.<eos> Kayla!<eos> You're in danger!<eos> Ma'am, I need to talk to Kayla.<eos> You need to talk to me, Brandon.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
My generals will never accept this.<eos> Well, this is the only deal India will accept.<eos> I suggest you convince your generals to get on board before the Indians change their minds and take your weapon to their labs to be dissected.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> It would make me a traitor to my people.<eos> You would take a hit politically.<eos> The alternative is war with India.<eos> Do you think your people would prefer that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Oh. Right.<eos> Dear God, I'm falling apart.<eos> All right, Genuine Thought... it's big business in the fight against student plagiarism.<eos> The software designers have acknowledged they're having problems with false positives, which is why the company has settled a few lawsuits last year.<eos> Wait, false positives how?<eos> It might tag a section as plagiarism when, in fact, it's just a phrase in common usage.<eos> For example, in one paper they flagged, "there's not enough money to go around," or "according to conventional wisdom"<eos> as plagiarized, when in fact they're just sort of clichés.<eos> Unoriginal, but not plagiarized.<eos> - So, what do I do?
Mrs. Florrick.<eos> Hello.<eos> Thank you so much for being here today.<eos> It's not by choice, Mr. Fox.<eos> I was subpoenaed.<eos> Well, thank you anyway.<eos> I don't want to make this any more confrontational than it has to be.<eos> So, please, just have a seat right here.<eos> I have several questions I think the grand jury would like to hear the answers to, um, but I understand that you have a right to invoke spousal privilege.<eos> - I do.
- Everything all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Pretty fast for an associate to get an office, isn't it?<eos> Lucca's good.<eos> Seems like yesterday when we were.<eos> So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
I escaped into the night.<eos> Before he caught up with me, I've... I found a barn full of horses.<eos> [Sighing] I tore apart every single one.<eos> Nothing I could do to stop it.<eos> And so why are we here?<eos> We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
I'm COO of St. Matthew's, and you can direct your questions to me.<eos> I have no comment at this time.<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> You know what? I think it's great that you've made this gesture of donating your work, and thank you, but you shouldn't be talking to the press on our behalf.<eos> Apologies.<eos> They shoved a mic in my face.<eos> You know, if you were a work of art... and I'm not saying you aren't... you would be a study in...<eos> Oh, please, don't try to define me, okay?<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> - No, but I do.
- That's a surprise.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> Well, when Laura was 17, her dad had an affair with a paralegal.<eos> Oh! So half-sister, not in Laura's life.<eos> Laura tried for years, but Lucy was...<eos> Let's just say, she's Laura without the moral compass.<eos> Jeez. At our wedding she took off with a case of whiskey and a valet parker.<eos> She was 16!<eos> Mmm. How did she come up?<eos> She didn't.
It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.<eos> Oh. Born and raised in L.A.<eos> Former Army Special Forces.<eos> Says here he's working overseas.<eos> He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.<eos> We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything.<eos> Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine. But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
Are you going to kill me?<eos> What?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.<eos> Alexis, I would never hurt you.<eos> This isn't what you think.<eos> What the hell is your game, Hayley?<eos> Believe me, you don't want to know.<eos> Neither does your father.
Good-bye.<eos> Eli Gold, bless his heart...<eos> Now is the time to put it in the...<eos> No, no, can't.<eos> All right, so put it over there, huh?<eos> Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.<eos> How many of these things do we got to do...?<eos> We got to fix that...<eos> Might have acquired a quick infusion of cash.<eos> He did.
I don't like that I can't remember.<eos> I don't like that I go away.<eos> But I am also glad... Glad that I'm taking the medication...<eos> I hope it helps... and mostly, above everything else,<eos> I am so glad that I have you.<eos> I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better.<eos> I... I really, really do.
There's something I got to tell you.<eos> I'm actually magical.<eos> I'm a unicorn.<eos> - You're a unicorn? - What?<eos> Y... Is that what you said?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
What else is there?<eos> Oh, I've, uh, already looked up a couple of part-time jobs that'll allow me to pay for my own insurance.<eos> - That's not necessary.<eos> - It is to me.<eos> I'm an adult.<eos> I don't need to be on my step-daddy's insurance.<eos> You know, actually, I think that's great.<eos> I think it's great that y-you want to be independent, Norman.<eos> I think that shows character.<eos> Oh, really? Do you, Alex?
You always loved new beginnings, Mother.<eos> Fresh starts.<eos> I don't think I can start over, Norman.<eos> I think you can, Mother.<eos> You will.<eos> We'll just do it together.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - You really want to do it? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do. I really do.
A bit of a local history nut myself.<eos> So, this guy that you're looking for...<eos> - It's a woman.<eos> Um... Ooh! Here we go!<eos> Look familiar?<eos> "Big Nose Kate."<eos> Long-time companion of a famous gunslinger... _<eos> Not the filly I'm looking for.<eos> Think blonde. Think striking.<eos> Men always do.
"When I think that truth alone "will never beat faulty logic, I bleed twice."<eos> now, if you count the letters in each word, you get a hexadecimal code which can then be translated into characters.<eos> Kid, just tell us what it says.<eos> "Atone full moon."<eos> Atone on the full moon?<eos> The full moon is tonight.<eos> At exactly 10:36 pm, which means we have less than 5 hours.<eos> The unsub's gonna kill those kids.<eos> We have no idea where he is.<eos> Antonia does.
! Yeah, Mom, like a million times that I am your biggest, stupidest mistake!<eos> Sorry I messed up your life so bad!<eos> Jennifer, that is not what I meant!<eos> And I'm sorry I'm screwing my life up, too!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not. You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
Sorry I messed up your life so bad!<eos> Jennifer, that is not what I meant!<eos> And I'm sorry I'm screwing my life up, too!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not. You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Oh. God bless your heart.<eos> Mm. I'm glad you told me... about Jackson's father.<eos> Now you understand why I'm doing this.<eos> Not a bit.<eos> Ah. It was an awfully sad story.<eos> But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
RANDY: If you're not gonna let me in, at least...<eos> Max!<eos> Wait up!<eos> You don't have to be embarrassed in front of me.<eos> I've seen worse.<eos> Okay, no I haven't.<eos> Just go away!<eos> I can't take that sad look. It's the same look you gave Chestnut that time he crapped on the couch.<eos> I'm fine alone; you didn't have to leave.<eos> No, I did.
Just like that?<eos> Do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is?<eos> How long?<eos> !<eos> How long have I been sitting on a couch discussing my marriage with someone who has already checked out?<eos> - That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I'm heading to the on-call room...<eos> Take a little nap.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah. Too bad you won't be getting any sleep.<eos> I don't want to talk, because you know what?<eos> I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do. - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
Callie, you and Arizona, before you guys split, you did the counseling thing, right?<eos> I mean, an hour wait for a table?<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> I'm hungry now.<eos> - Oh. - This was such a better idea.<eos> Place looks nice.<eos> Changed some things around, huh?<eos> Some new pillows.<eos> I like those.<eos> No, you don't.
Adrian, what's up?<eos> Three armed suspects inside, about 20 hostages, and they beat up a security guard pretty bad.<eos> - Anybody talk to them yet?<eos> - They said something about<eos> - wanting a helicopter. - Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> - Let me get you... - We should probably get the element of surprise.<eos> - Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, right?<eos> I'm just saying it's not exactly Ocean's Eleven in there.<eos> Hey, could you get this guy out of here?<eos> Sorry, I didn't...
- All right.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> I will see you tomorrow, right?<eos> You're not gonna go home and, like...<eos> No. Not tonight.<eos> But you want to.<eos> For real.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Dad!<eos> I'm trying to get a time guesstimate here, sweetie.<eos> -Make sure you wash your hands!<eos> -Dad! [Claire] His character in Taste of Love is totally my favorite.<eos> I mean, I definitely liked him in Leaves in the Fall.<eos> He was a lot more, like, sensitive?<eos> Oh, and then there was An Arrow Through My Heart. He was a lot more manly.<eos> Oh, and then there was a time he played an alien -who didn't think he'd ever fall in love.<eos> -I love you.<eos> And then he did.
Seo-yeon, how's the entrée for my mother?<eos> Sorry, Chef, but there's no ticket.<eos> [sighs] I verbalized it!<eos> Fire it now!<eos> Do you have anything else I can serve her?<eos> Oh, um, I have three portions of rotelle that I can make into four.<eos> That's enough. I got this.<eos> Just clean that up.<eos> Seth, they've never had an off night like this before.<eos> What do I do?
Well, since she's been gone it's been different.<eos> -Did she...<eos> -Yeah.<eos> He's changed a lot since it happened.<eos> He doesn't smile much anymore...<eos> I guess she was the one that always brought the happy to the relationship?<eos> You know, she, she was a lot like your dad.<eos> Just... full of joy.<eos> How do you know about my father?<eos> I don't!
I quit.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You can't go back on something that's been decided.<eos> Take some responsibility!<eos> Joon, please slow down!<eos> I'm a... television character!<eos> And kind of a jerk!<eos> Yeah, but, like, the total fan favorite.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Do?
Oh shoot, I'm all outta nails.<eos> Oh, here you go.<eos> Pinky, don't!<eos> What?<eos> Ooh, did you think the nails would explode like the sprinkles?<eos> Wow, glad that didn't happen, huh?<eos> Sorry girls, I didn't mean to.<eos> I don't know how to control this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> None of us do.
Because I like to make a point of telling my blackmailer everything. Come now.<eos> I'm more than your blackmailer.<eos> Yes, you're a man who murders for pleasure, as you've just reminded me.<eos> A killer with a contingency letter hanging over my head, in case anything should happen to you.<eos> You know my secrets.<eos> And I know yours.<eos> You had your own daughter beaten to reclaim the regency.<eos> And I've gone so long without a kill.<eos> I don't know why you rule out a future for us.<eos> I don't.
She's postictal and protecting her airway.<eos> Let's get another head CT and page pediatric neurology.<eos> This is what you were talking about, huh?<eos> Yes, seizures can be a part of her condition.<eos> How long will she have 'em?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Her whole life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That woman has a long road ahead of her.<eos> They both do.
I guess you best be on your way.<eos> You take care, Megan.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Let me clean you up a little, Theo.<eos> Pam Pilcher.<eos> What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Obviously, there'll be some failures, such as yours.<eos> Which is why we need to encourage the First Generation to bear children as quickly as possible.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But you can preserve humanity and try to hold on to some, at the same time.<eos> You do realize you're asking children to bear children.<eos> Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
And Adam's the only one who's ever returned.<eos> They're gone.<eos> This is a rare opportunity.<eos> With the Abbies retreated, we can work without fear.<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> Let me find my son.<eos> But every time one thing here seems almost rational, two things pop up that make absolutely no sense at all.<eos> Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
This experiment ends now.<eos> No!<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
I'm past that.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You can invite me to your, uh... anniversary party.<eos> Baby shower.<eos> Look, I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> It could be days. It could be hours.<eos> But whatever it is, I'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge.<eos> So what I need to know is where you stand.<eos> I don't matter.<eos> No you don't.
That happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labors."<eos> "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but it was already impossible to say which was which."<eos> Well, yes, but it's actually quite idealistic.<eos> At the beginning.<eos> Did you finish it?<eos> Sometimes rules are good.<eos> Essential, even.<eos> It's... an allegory.<eos> So it doesn't mean anything.<eos> Maybe 20 years ago it did.
I know.<eos> Well, I thought I did a pretty good job for you, but I guess I was wrong.<eos> So, you say hello to the future for me, okay?<eos> Arlene.<eos> You're taking his pod.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still don't know why you did that.<eos> And I don't, either.
'They finally let me make a call.'<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> This will be all straightened out.<eos> I didn't do what they accuse me of.<eos> 'You know that. Don't you? '<eos> The girl identified you, Kristian.<eos> 'My love... I would never...'<eos> It's not in my nature, you know that.<eos> Don't you?
The DNA results are back on the remains in the shed.<eos> We ran them against your husband.<eos> It's a confirmed match with your daughter.<eos> It's really Alice?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She asked me.<eos> She begged me.<eos> It's not Matthew's fault that this happened.<eos> He knows what he's done.<eos> You both do.
Give us the pass.<eos> What are they going to do to you?<eos> Dad, you can't...<eos> Give me the pass.<eos> And just keep your mum out of this cos she doesn't need this worry right now, OK?<eos> OK. - OK, I won't tell her.<eos> - What I said to you in the hospital, I don't know how many times I have to apologise for that.<eos> How many times I have to tell you I don't blame you for what happened to Alice.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - But I do.
The secretary was a spy.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> I guess it was really hard for Mr. Beeman to talk to her father.<eos> I-I just went over there looking for Henry, and he... he started telling me this stuff.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
We have to go.<eos> Come.<eos> I need you to be my big boy.<eos> Drek!<eos> Shh. A new world awaits us.<eos> And out there, we will be gods.<eos> Then I tossed my badge and said, "Have fun with your girlfriend".<eos> 'Cause he loves work so much.<eos> - But it didn't really land, you know?<eos> - I do not.
Your will specifies that your second heir is your sister's eldest child.<eos> Only if Louis dies before he is 30, which he will not.<eos> I'm sure, but the point is... .. I know your sister's eldest child.<eos> What?<eos> You remember my late brother?<eos> I'll remember him to my dying day.<eos> Then you must also know that your sister's eldest child was his child, too.<eos> - But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.
I knew it'd be empty for the winter. So.<eos> I thought it'd be safe.<eos> I understand the desire to protect your son, believe me.<eos> But what were you so worried about?<eos> A cop gets shot out of the blue.<eos> You never know why.<eos> You never know if they're gonna come after the family.<eos> Vince, Nancy being shot is an unbelievable tragedy, but to think your family is in danger, that's a bit of a stretch.<eos> Unless, you know something you're not sharing with me.<eos> I don't.
There's a camera inside.<eos> Someone screwed it in right over your poker table.<eos> What?<eos> The warning shots the thieves fired almost hit it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> Before the last open house, I put 27-watt bulbs in everywhere.<eos> It's a staging thing-- makes the space more inviting.<eos> I thought you said no one knew where or when the game was being played until the day of.<eos> They didn't.
Are you worried?<eos> But, I can promise you, they'll sleep well tonight.<eos> I ordered a high dose of Zofran in their IVs with an Ativan chaser.<eos> Wow. That's a party I wish I was at.<eos> Oh, my God, are you guys freaking kidding me?<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> For real?<eos> You got a beautiful voice, man.<eos> I do.
- You know?<eos> - You went for a walk.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yeah, two days ago.<eos> - Oh. And I've been looking for you, checking the hospitals. Oh.<eos> And then I found out from this nice doctor that you were looking for me.<eos> I was.<eos> - He gets a little confused.<eos> - Yeah. But she still loves me.<eos> Yes, I do.
But the truth is, I had to come home sometime.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I miss her every day.<eos> Fauzi, I'm so sorry.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> I changed my number.<eos> I didn't want to be found.<eos> But it'll be good to see you now.<eos> We have so much to catch up on.<eos> Yes, we do.
18 years old.<eos> My goodness, she's lovely.<eos> Fauzi.<eos> What?<eos> A daughter's a blessing.<eos> And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
The Caliphate took responsibility for the attack in Ma'an City and Emma Al Fayeed's abduction on their Web site late this evening.<eos> They're not gonna leave us alone, are they, the Caliphate?<eos> There's no living side by side.<eos> They're gonna push us and push us until it's like, "Either you kill us or we kill you."<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope not.<eos> It's not enough to hope though, is it?<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is the last time I'm gonna say this to you.<eos> Hey, guys. What's going on?<eos> Nothing. It's over.<eos> Is this about the H-VAD?<eos> Oh, is that what everybody's talking about...<eos> How idiot Angus almost killed Anne Stringer?<eos> No one thinks you almost killed her.<eos> Wouldn't matter if I did.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Did what?
Did I send these to you? Or should I just post it?<eos> What?<eos> I mean, who am I to say no to someone like you?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Senator, I really need you to sit.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> Gas leak.<eos> My wife, Hank Wesley, all those good people hurt because of a rusty valve.<eos> This doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Remember when I told you you were good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're still good, Angus.<eos> You're still good.<eos> First time in 20 hours we're out of code black.<eos> What are you grinning about?<eos> You got your money, Jesse. What money?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> You got your nurses, Mama. You did it.<eos> No, you did it, Daddy.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
- Now, the Greshamsbury title deeds.<eos> - You mustn't worry about that.<eos> Your lawyers know all there is to know.<eos> It's what my lawyers tell me that brings me here.<eos> See, I gather I've more £90,000 tied up in the Greshamsbury estate.<eos> Something of that kind.<eos> The estate is a fine one.<eos> There is no risk.<eos> - What if I need the money?<eos> - But you don't.
I feel so high up, here.<eos> Will you help me down?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mary... .. do you remember when we were last together?<eos> I remember you were very foolish.<eos> Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.<eos> Sheldon.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- Later, Leslie.<eos> So what now?<eos> We wait for the Constable from Station House Number Five to collect, and we follow wherever he leads.<eos> How do we prove where the money came from?<eos> I can't see a bloody thing.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But... under the ultra violet light...<eos> You're to use these bills to make the payment.<eos> - Why "these" bills?<eos> - Just do it.
Someday you'll walk into a mall and shoot everyone?<eos> - Never mind me.<eos> I'm saying this isn't about me.<eos> I'm saying I'm not the reason to keep this place open and neither is Marsha.<eos> If you want to kick her out, kick her out.<eos> She's had her run here.<eos> She was your dad's pleasure chest, and then my dad honored him by keeping her here.<eos> But, yeah, I mean, we don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, we don't owe you anything, Marsha.<eos> Nobody does.
Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.<eos> It doesn't matter who tipped them off.<eos> What matters is, if we lose this suit, we can't handle the money.<eos> How much are they suing us for?<eos> - $100 million.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
Does Missy Dietler know you couldn't hold your mud?<eos> Oh, heavens no.<eos> The Turkish silt was thick enough to prevent her from feeling it, so...<eos> Was it thick enough to hide you wanting to go sleep after?<eos> My God, she knew. I got news for you, Louis. They always know.<eos> Oh, you're so right.<eos> She... I need 15 minutes to myself.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I cut a deal, and now I'm here. Wait a second. If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance to turn on someone to get out of it.<eos> They did.
Excuse me, ladies. Sorry to interrupt, but I think we might have a problem.<eos> What is it, Benjamin?<eos> We're being hacked<eos> Oh, that's a tidy little sum you got there.<eos> You're not doing so bad yourself.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> Not bad for two people that came from nothing.<eos> I didn't come from nothing, and you know it.<eos> Bet it still feels pretty good to write that number down.<eos> Oh, it sure does.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you get a chance to finish that sketch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did a really great job on this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.<eos> Why would you ever want to go back?<eos> I don't.
Another $300 ‭I could have spent drinking.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought all this bullshit was over.<eos> It is.<eos> You're under arrest for I-don't-know-how-many counts of rape.<eos> - Excuse me? - Rape? What?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Women submit applications to sleep with me.<eos> You've made that very clear to us, and also that you don't use drugs.<eos> He doesn't.
- What?<eos> Let's pill punch!<eos> All right, fella? Thursday night, do you know what I mean?<eos> I don't know what this is.<eos> I'm supposed to meet a girl, I'm supposed to give her some money.<eos> Don't mention the money! - Fucking hell, man.<eos> - Be discreet, all right?<eos> This is not the place you want people to know you're carrying around?<eos> 3,000. - Three grand?<eos> - What do I do?
My boy idolised that man. Mrs Allman...<eos> He trusted you!<eos> He trusted you!<eos> Mrs Allman, please, sit down.<eos> MAN: Ma'am?<eos> Major Hamilton, would you agree Corporal Allman was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did the Army do anything to help that condition?<eos> We have considerable resources available to those who need help.<eos> Steve didn't.
Won't we also get asked who took it?<eos> Probably. And the answer is...<eos> A Royal Commission officer.<eos> Who was on his own, unauthorised, snooping through a girl's bedroom we're about to call as a witness.<eos> It is still reasonable grounds.<eos> On the public record, we'd look like idiotic sleazebags.<eos> It's a mildly embarrassing footnote!<eos> Some people would kill for that story.<eos> Some would kill for half a million.<eos> Yeah, someone did.
Heather O'Connor.<eos> O-apostrophe-C-O-N-N-O-R.<eos> This is an electronically recorded interview with ourselves and Hassan Nobakht, otherwise known as Sam Nobakht, being conducted in State Crime Command, Parramatta.<eos> Sam, could you please state your full name and date of birth?<eos> Hassan Nobakht, 5th November 1994.<eos> And you agree that no-one else is in this room? Yes.<eos> 'What if he comes back? ' Your words to Amil.<eos> Who were you talking about?<eos> No-one. You know who shot up your house.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't know, he wouldn't show me.<eos> I told him to put it back.<eos> But that car alarm was waking up Rookwood Cemetery. I had to get him out of there.<eos> You say Todd was your mate.<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> Any idea why someone would want to kill him?<eos> My best guess, he's done something dumb.<eos> Tried to rip off the wrong person, they've come after him.<eos> The world's full of arseholes, people who deserve what they get.<eos> Todd didn't.
Iran, yes.<eos> This is the view from our holiday apartment by the Caspian Sea.<eos> The water is very beautiful and warm, although in Iran no-one goes in the water, we just walk on the sand.<eos> The boys don't want to go in without the girls, and we have to stay fully clothed.<eos> Someone's always watching.<eos> Government informers are everywhere.<eos> It's better now.<eos> Ten years ago you would just be taken off the street.<eos> At least in this country, we thought we would know who are enemies are.<eos> But we often don't, do we?
Great. Let me know when he's here.<eos> Any news?<eos> Nothing tangible.<eos> If we don't already have phone taps on the Nobakht boys, can you make sure we do from now on?<eos> Oh, Bianca left that for you.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> So, what'd Elaheh say?<eos> Did she tell you her husband was a car thief and a drug dealer?<eos> Well, we're not sure Elaheh knows anything, but Amil does.<eos> So, Amil does and Bahman does.
Ferrari-stealing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It turns out high-performance vehicles like that only really get stolen on order, when the stealer knows he has a buyer.<eos> There's no point otherwise. They attract far too much attention.<eos> Where does that get you?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> You go, I'll be right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You alright?<eos> So, what do I do?
I don't know, I... Well, earlier than I would have said a few weeks ago.<eos> Examining the case law has challenged my preconceptions too.<eos> You're not, are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What?<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I... I thought you couldn't, 'cause you had...<eos> Idiopathic infertility. So did I.
- Got her.<eos> They're heading north on the 9.<eos> Got it.<eos> César, sit.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sure you know I'm very interested in what you have to say.<eos> I come here with mutual interests in mind.<eos> I see, so this is like a goodwill visit.<eos> But you have nothing to offer. Oh.<eos> But I do.
No, I quit, okay?<eos> No, forget it.<eos> Man, Dion, you're on parole.<eos> You get caught ripping off a wine warehouse, they'll put you away for 10 years.<eos> You know what?<eos> Your wine is that important to me, T.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> - All right, fine.<eos> - Look, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do...
I flagged every similar crime in the database<eos> Which occurred four months on either side of the attack, And within a 30-mile radius.<eos> This is what came back.<eos> And, buzz, uh look, i -- i saw the tape.<eos> The guys who killed your father, these were not beginners.<eos> They probably had a pattern of atm robberies.<eos> How do i approach this?<eos> One page at a time.<eos> Tao.<eos> Hey, buddy, how you doing?
Why not just say what you want to say in the text?<eos> No opinions at all.<eos> That is not an opinion.<eos> That is a question.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Gus, you are very patient.<eos> With him, it's necessary.<eos> But it pays off.<eos> - Don't you think?<eos> - I do.
No opinions at all.<eos> That is not an opinion.<eos> That is a question.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Gus, you are very patient.<eos> With him, it's necessary.<eos> But it pays off.<eos> - Don't you think?<eos> - I do.<eos> I most definitely do.
He never left the country.<eos> Pizzas for everybody.<eos> Let's wait for the dna.<eos> And doctors and lawyers and psychologist.<eos> Yeah, we manage all their upgrades, too.<eos> You mean the ones that come automatically online?<eos> Hey, it's not fraud.<eos> It's time-saving.<eos> And we use our own cybersecurity program ourselves.<eos> Yes, we do.
Well, since he's a man, You need to figure out if his actions on the job Make him less stable.<eos> If a woman had done what julio did, Wouldn't you think she was super tough?<eos> I make co-worker inquiries about women, too, And i treat everyone the same.<eos> I'm just --<eos> And i don't want kids, at all -- mine or other people's<eos> Or yours -- so maybe some of your gender assumptions Need an update. Okay, let's just talk about<eos> Detective sanchez's behavior last week.<eos> Yes, let's, because julio would take a bullet for me Or anyone else who worked here without thinking.<eos> And what does that count for in your analysis, A willingness to sacrifice for others?<eos> A lot, but so does self-control.
We've been married now for three years and I've seen you, maybe, 98 days over that time.<eos> Well, you're at trials.<eos> I mean, I'm... I run a law firm.<eos> That's just who we are.<eos> Diane, I'm selling my business.<eos> I want to move in together... full-time.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You had me so worried.<eos> I thought you wanted a divorce!<eos> I don't.
What are you thinking?<eos> I'm thinking our client is guilty.<eos> We've represented guilty clients before.<eos> Not like this.<eos> He went to WikiLeaks about a military action.<eos> That, to me, is treason.<eos> Is it not to you?<eos> Now, then... I have thought long and hard about this issue, and based on what I have heard, I find there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the espionage charge; therefore, Mr. Dellinger's extradition is hereby approved.<eos> Ma'am, we have one more motion to be considered.<eos> We do?
But, for your daughter's sake, we will search everything in Chris' house... just to prove I'm right.<eos> Sharon B.: Ooh. ‭That's a little cold, Doctor.<eos> I know, but don't move because...<eos> - [Beep] - There we go.<eos> Wow.<eos> Is that like a halo?<eos> No.<eos> That was the baby's hair.<eos> It already has hair?<eos> Sure does.
Stop, okay?<eos> Just stop.<eos> We know you bought the oxycodone to put in Chris Walker's protein powder.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Oxy?<eos> - In the vanilla powder?<eos> - Very Vanilla.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I made him that shake.<eos> Yeah, you did.
How is any of this my fault?<eos> What did I do to you?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You were born.<eos> Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
- I had to re...<eos> I had to resect the wider margins to get to healthy bone, okay?<eos> The fibular grafts will be too small to hold everything in place.<eos> I've got no way to dock the leg.<eos> We don't have a fallback plan here.<eos> Okay, I need you to hear me.<eos> This is not a matter of confidence, okay?<eos> It's not me. It is the bone.<eos> I am saying that, with the pelvis that I have left, I literally cannot do it.<eos> Well, you better do something.
So, did you find something new or...<eos> Warren, we need you to tell us why.<eos> Why what?<eos> Why, when the elevator doors opened, you chose to ignore it...<eos> I have told you and told you and cut open Gretchen McKay anyway.<eos> ...that I did not make a choice.<eos> I wasn't given one.<eos> I-I was forced to use the knowledge and resources I had to fulfill the oath I took to save her life...<eos> Because the door didn't open.<eos> No, it did.
I'm saying I didn't see it happen.<eos> I just don't understand how you didn't see it happen.<eos> You do.<eos> You know. Y-You should know.<eos> Y-You're surgeons.<eos> You know what it's like.<eos> You... When you operate, when you control if a person breathes another breath, when... when you hold their beating heart in your hand, when you are responsible for that life, you don't see or hear or feel anything else.<eos> The rest of the world just disappears.<eos> You know that.<eos> You all do.
How do you...<eos> D-Do you have any idea how far behind I'll fall?<eos> I'll never get caught up.<eos> What am I supposed to learn from this?<eos> Do you feel even the slightest remorse?<eos> Yes. Yes!<eos> H-How can you ask me that?<eos> Of course I do!<eos> All I do is play it over again in my mind, trying to figure out how I could change it.<eos> Of course I do.
Pressure's 60 over 40.<eos> Edwards, let's prep for a thoracotomy.<eos> Oh, my G...<eos> Uh, o-okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Edwards, what if we did a balloon catheter?<eos> Robbins was in there.<eos> I saw her.<eos> You saw her?<eos> I did.
I wanted to prove that you were put in a position that...<eos> No, I wanted to know that you made the right call.<eos> Right.<eos> There was no other call to make.<eos> I believed that.<eos> I wanted to believe that.<eos> The patient was dying.<eos> I made the decision to save her life.<eos> You made a decision that you didn't have to make.<eos> Yes, I did.
His legs will be stretched. And broken on the rack once our Dark Lord catches up to him.<eos> But, Dear Sister... the Dark Lord told us to look after one another.<eos> And I can help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Tell me what happened to Mary.<eos> You were there.<eos> He wrenched from her all the powers he had granted her, as if he was turning her inside out.<eos> I do not know how she survived it.<eos> But she did?
Those exact words.<eos> They're playing on a loop in my head.<eos> Put a pin in Minister Avdonin and find me Dean Ward.<eos> Get her on the phone?<eos> No, find out where she is.<eos> Right now?<eos> Dean Ward, what a coincidence.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I didn't know you went here.<eos> I don't.
"I'll keep Grandpa safe." He's 5, Angela.<eos> He's not supposed to be thinking about things like that.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I'm so sorry, Joann.<eos> I mean, my dad could've been shot.<eos> He... or... or... or worse.<eos> My God.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I don't know why I came here.<eos> I-I don't...
- Says you.<eos> - Why don't we let the courts decide whether she's a saint or a sinner?<eos> We just wanna know how to find her.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - When was the last time you saw her?<eos> It's been a while.<eos> The officers that found you two in the tunnels said you were pretty well set up.<eos> I'm sure you don't want us to be bothering you all the time.<eos> - Don't you guys have better things to do?<eos> - We do.
His neck was snapped, likely from behind.<eos> - Same M.O. as our victim.<eos> - Somebody followed him to New York to kill him.<eos> They really didn't want any loose ends.<eos> What the hell were these guys into?<eos> Is this the stuff from the gym bag?<eos> Uh, yes. I haven't processed it all yet.<eos> But Kent didn't find any prints other than the victim's.<eos> Didn't his medical records say that he had a peanut allergy?<eos> Yes, it did.
It was the two of you at the beach, remember?<eos> It doesn't look like he has any clothes. - Oh!<eos> - Oh! - Really?<eos> - No.<eos> So, whatever happened to Johnny?<eos> - He pulled a real disappearing act.<eos> - Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act? - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> You really don't.
You never come in here and hug me whenever you want.<eos> Until now.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No! What... Just...<eos> Well, she ruled out the sister.<eos> Based on what?<eos> The sister was left-handed.<eos> That means she had a completely different embalming technique.<eos> Sam did the embalming.
Just... dinner.<eos> You know, a-a chance to talk about things.<eos> - What things? !<eos> - Important things.<eos> It's nothing bad.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on. We had fun over drinks.<eos> Right? I mean, didn't we?<eos> We ... Yeah, we did.<eos> - 'Cause I did.
- Okay.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Bye, hon.<eos> - See ya.<eos> Yeah, I think he wants me to be the one to push him to retire, but I know it's got to be his decision.<eos> Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay for me to be away from my parents, because I am an adult, but Mateo isn't... and he should be close to his father.<eos> Uh, lady, what?<eos> Need I remind you of my built-in dishwasher and the fact that there are jets in the master bath?<eos> I don't care about the dishwasher and the jets<eos> - in the bath, okay? - I'm not gonna change my mind!<eos> Whoa, whoa. Why are you yelling at me?<eos> I get it.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes. I do.
It's what we're going to use to defeat the Warden.<eos> Well, how?<eos> I didn't exactly see any good in him.<eos> Uh, it... it's there.<eos> And the good has been fighting to get out for a long time, but it never could.<eos> Till now.<eos> The flower... it's from the vine you were trimming back in the garden.<eos> Yes. The final ingredient.<eos> If only he knew I was growing it right under his nose.<eos> Actually, he did.
And if I am?<eos> Then I get you a job.<eos> And if I'm not?<eos> Then you never see me again.<eos> And the next time you have an incident, you will go to solitary confinement for a month.<eos> So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
I make the rules.<eos> And no one will stop me.<eos> Not Bobo, not Black Badge, and certainly not a useless son of a goddamned bitch like you.<eos> Willa, no...<eos> He wasn't giving us anything.<eos> He wasn't ours to kill.<eos> - Dolls...<eos> - ...has nothing to do with this curse and certainly has a serious attitude problem.<eos> I don't like him, Wynonna.<eos> Well, who does?
- No.<eos> OK.<eos> OK, go.<eos> Shit.<eos> Willa?<eos> WILLA!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Do you remember me now?<eos> Yes, Robert.<eos> I do.
I'm not waiting to get her.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> She's our sister.<eos> As long as I get to kick someone's ass.<eos> That can be arranged.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Right initials, wrong fella.<eos> Robert,<eos> - you don't want to do this.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Hokk 9's illegal on this moon.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Westhole's a pile of bricks.<eos> I can set you up.<eos> First one's free.<eos> You gave me acid?<eos> That's just rude.<eos> Screw you, Killjoy.<eos> Hey, dumbass, you didn't read the whole warrant did you?<eos> Of course I did.
Romwell's dead. Lucy, time to go.<eos> If you ever find it, you'll still have to trade for it.<eos> Fair is fair. And dead is dead!<eos> Of course you've got the plasma.<eos> You're a Level VI!<eos> Those trouble-makers your RAC sends around the J?<eos> Please.<eos> Call it what you want, but those "visitors" who came to your planet pumped you full of that green shit.<eos> That's why you're still alive.<eos> They did no such thing.
Do you?<eos> Hey, Sam, two seconds.<eos> So, about that little conversation you just had with Danny, he was wrong to ask you out.<eos> He's with Riley.<eos> He is?<eos> What a jerk.<eos> Yeah, he sure can be.<eos> I'm annoyed with him, too.<eos> Did he at least tell you that I wanted to have some one-on-one time with you?<eos> No, he did not.
I can't be the only one, right?<eos> Super sorry to interrupt, but what the hell did you think was going on?<eos> Tucker said you hit on him.<eos> She did.<eos> She was lurking around our door looking for something.<eos> I mean, what else is a young, confident man to assume?<eos> Ben!<eos> I was talking about Ben.<eos> I thought we had a connection.<eos> We did!
And 30?<eos> It sounds better, a rounder figure.<eos> Thirty is a number...<eos> If you leave the firm, yes.<eos> Marcel, would you leave?<eos> -Me?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -No. -No.<eos> But I do have to leave.<eos> I do.
Buttercup has a clock in his head.<eos> He can do the course in perfect time.<eos> Don't forget how he runs across the pasture whenever he sees me.<eos> He's an angel on this earth.<eos> And he moves like a cat.<eos> The way he transitions into a canter, it's like... like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Politically and emotionally.<eos> I doubt she has the sophistication<eos> - to run a game that deep.<eos> - All the same, maybe it's time to start treating her like an enemy combatant, and less like our nation's favorite houseguest.<eos> You want to take a terrified young woman to a black site for enhanced interrogation.<eos> - Yeah, hello.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - 'Cause this approach does not.
God, it feels like you don't know even know me.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's frustrating.<eos> You were there when Hizb al-Shahid set off that dirty bomb.<eos> - Our children were there!<eos> - I know!<eos> Well, HS still has nuclear material in their possession.<eos> Stopping them has to be our first priority.<eos> I get it, Elizabeth!<eos> Well, I...<eos> I do.
Wants to experience it like a local.<eos> And he thinks you're just gonna let him take off like that?<eos> He wants me to retire with him.<eos> What?<eos> Ms. Goodwin?<eos> Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
Eric will be in the hospital for four to five days, maybe a week.<eos> So I guess I'll be seeing you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got to get back to work.<eos> Sure.<eos> He's a young kid, he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> Now be honest, you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
I'm trying, man.<eos> For my family.<eos> Well, then you got to be strong for them.<eos> Right?<eos> Man, you're Nick Kovac.<eos> They can't tell you shit.<eos> Right? Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> He's got to show me something first.<eos> If he does, who knows?<eos> Emma Harris?<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.
You're being ridiculous.<eos> The whole conspiracy with this is absurd.<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, I just stopped by to see how you are doing.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Can you talk some sense into my brother?<eos> I don't know if you remember my brother, David.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Red velvet.<eos> I know it's not your favorite, boss, but Sherrie wanted it for her birthday.<eos> - Hi. Zoning board is on my ass.<eos> Where is that, uh, environmental impact study for the redevelopment project?<eos> - Which one? - The west side.<eos> I'll call Fitz, tell him we need it ASAP.<eos> Oh, and this one. She works at that shithole over on Franklin.<eos> - Patsy's.<eos> - Yeah, she wants to quit.<eos> - You do?
He can't be one with one eye.<eos> Okay?<eos> It doesn't mean that I love him or I miss him or I'm pining.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> No, he's not a friend because the breakup was a train wreck, and he probably hates me, but he is a person, or was a person, that I was personal with.<eos> I mean, you had feelings.<eos> You had huge feelings, and you can't be expected just to turn those feelings off like some robot.<eos> Especially if you've been through something horrible together.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Trying to what?<eos> Trying to figure out a way to justify the beating he gave to Andrew?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I poured my heart out to you all day.<eos> And you knew this.<eos> It wasn't about you, Maggie.<eos> I am your sister.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?
Everyone wins.<eos> What about the daughter?<eos> I can make her cry on the stand.<eos> Or she'll end up telling the truth.<eos> Ms. Winterbottom, either call your next witness or I'm making my decision.<eos> We'd like to call Faiza Assaf, Your Honor.<eos> I told Annalise she can't testify.<eos> It'll buy us time.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
M.E. is sending DNA from the bomb blast to the FBI crime lab.<eos> The Zahavis also sent their son's DNA, and it's being processed now.<eos> And how long till we get the results?<eos> You don't have time to wait, Agent Callen.<eos> Proceed as if we're right on this, for your own sake.<eos> Nadir, I need you to listen to me.<eos> You were not abandoned.<eos> Your parents did not give you up.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, actually, I do.
It should be okay to remove the sensor.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get you both out of here.<eos> Let's get you up the ladder.<eos> Let's get you out.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
Do you really want to die? You know the prophet, alayhi as-salam. said a person who commits suicide is doomed to all eternity to repeat his death over and over.<eos> Don't listen to him!<eos> Americans lie.<eos> Sam, using images from your body cam and their entrance visas, we've matched three...<eos> Make that four.<eos> Sorry, four children, using their birthdays, to the same clinic where Nadir was born.<eos> Means they have parents.<eos> Use it.<eos> You have a family out there.<eos> No, we don't.
He knows we won't do anything with humans around.<eos> That's it?<eos> He's a liability to all of us, he needs to be put down before he kills anyone else.<eos> More bodies to bury.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest.<eos> For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
A bit.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This fallen woman is dragging you down.<eos> You know what's weird?<eos> I'm more judgmental about my daughter's Christianity than yours.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And yet you have two top partners at your table.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> I haven't even gotten to my question yet.<eos> Why don't we wait till she gets to her question, then I'll sustain.<eos> I used to work for their firm, Your Honor.<eos> And this case wouldn't even be considered<eos> - unless there was an ulterior motive.<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - That has nothing to do with this case.<eos> - But it does, Your Honor.
It is well-established that a person has a reasonable expectation to privacy in his own home.<eos> No, it is a clear case of Reese Dipple trying<eos> - to create law.<eos> Look! - Your Honor!<eos> The expectation of privacy is in relation to government surveillance.<eos> If Dr. Nachmann simply uses some discretion<eos> - by pulling his blinds...<eos> - He shouldn't have to.<eos> Your Honor, we have to weigh the minor inconvenience to Dr. Nachmann against the significant public interest in preventing crime.<eos> - So we do.
Oh, well, then perhaps we should talk to someone from the FAA.<eos> If Peter sent you...<eos> He didn't.<eos> Well, what do you need?<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Privately?<eos> Uh, certainly.<eos> I need a lawyer.<eos> You do?<eos> Or Peter does?
'Cause trust me, no one has logged more hours.<eos> Okay, you know what? I'm coming with you.<eos> No, Booth, I am a full-grown adult.<eos> I don't need you to babysit me.<eos> Okay, all I'm asking, is that you keep your phone on you so I can reach you at any time.<eos> My father will be back shortly, when he is, you can leave for work.<eos> Bones, why are you even doing this?<eos> You don't even believe in psychology.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
I didn't-I didn't-I...<eos> What did he look like?<eos> I couldn't see his face.<eos> It was too dark.<eos> He was wearing a sweatshirt with, um, a-a hood on it and he had... he had gloves.<eos> What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't see anything else, I swear.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I don't.
It's got to be something else.<eos> Okay, so, uh, in the-in the basement, there were the photos of all of us.<eos> No, no, I'm not buying that, all right?<eos> The photos, they're just a smokescreen.<eos> Well, I agree.<eos> Everything else points to Dr. Brennan.<eos> The way the victim was clothed.<eos> The way her hair was cut.<eos> The question is, how does killing Melissa get him closer to Bones?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
But, in my opinion, feelings are malleable and easily manipulated.<eos> Booth has formed a connection with the victim's father because he, too, has an addiction to gambling. It's... it's a struggle Booth knows all too well.<eos> And because Booth can now see himself in the victim's father, he no longer feels the man would be capable of killing his own son.<eos> This is why I trust science over heart.<eos> Science cannot be swayed.<eos> And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie.<eos> I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
Well, speaking of things we can get rid of...<eos> - No way!<eos> Are you kid...<eos> - This beer hat.<eos> - Now, that's not happening.<eos> - Booth, Booth!<eos> We're not making any progress,<eos> Hank and Christine are getting big fast, and we agreed to make space.<eos> Beer hat stays, and the Cocky belt buckle, - Ugh. - and you can keep those weird stones.<eos> Fine, as long as we do something with that pile of socks.
... then I will have him swab the fracture.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Am I, uh, interrupting a date?<eos> Maybe a drug deal?<eos> Excuse me for a minute.<eos> Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
So you flew Halfway around the world to tell her your suspicions.<eos> I knew that she could not look me in the eye And not know that i was speaking the truth.<eos> All right, let's pretend you are telling the truth.<eos> All right, you dropped this bombshell on her, She confronts her husband, He kills her.<eos> Either way, there's still blood on your hands.<eos> Don't you think i realize that?<eos> This man has money and power.<eos> And in my experience, people with money and power Will do anything to keep it.<eos> Why would i trust you?<eos> Hmm? Your boss didn't.
He was a friend.<eos> Do you know who killed him?<eos> No.<eos> But if it's someone he crossed paths with before, the name will be in his war journals.<eos> They're a log of everything he did as the Midnight Ranger.<eos> You'll find them at his headquarters.<eos> I imagine this is what it feels like the first time one steps into the Batcave.<eos> This must be Mike Stratton's war journals.<eos> Last night, you asked if I had a problem with you assisting my father.<eos> I do.
She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.<eos> The only thing I ever wanted to be is the one thing no woman is allowed to be...<eos> A warrior.<eos> To take revenge for my family.<eos> Just sorry I failed.<eos> You didn't fail.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
And when the chips fall, it's important you know who your friends are.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Stop the cart.<eos> What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
Be my guest.<eos> I am to be granted private interview, am I?<eos> Perhaps you'll begin by telling me on what evidence you named the man Croker.<eos> And if, as it now seems likely, it was not he performed these savage acts, you will now be reopening the investigation into the murder of Inspector Bennet Drake.<eos> I shall not be taking questions on this matter until autopsy is made.<eos> Then why bring me here?<eos> Why not simply make your denial and cast me out?<eos> You believe yourself a good journalist, I am sure.<eos> Good, I mean, in that you understand the moral imperative of the truth.<eos> I do.
Oh! Lily, we were gonna open Grams' gifts together!<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> Grams left you a watch. Oh!<eos> The note says,<eos> "Your grandpa tore it right off of a dead kraut's wrist."<eos> Oh, that's so sweet!<eos> And I got these.<eos> "Enjoy all my old lipstick, you big sissy."<eos> Why did she call me a sissy?<eos> - She doesn't -- Oh!
That makes sense. It's the Internal Affairs of the parent agency of the Bureau.<eos> They probably heard what we heard.<eos> They should be defending him, not charging him.<eos> Whoever's doing this wants me here instead of investigating.<eos> There has to be a bigger plan because they want my team distracted.<eos> Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
Ok, warden, we're 5 minutes out.<eos> Guys, the swatting, the reference to Asher-- this is exactly the larger plan we profiled.<eos> It worked.<eos> Rawdon has another group he's been working from the inside.<eos> By the time we clear Hotch, they'll be gone.<eos> Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
- What did you do now? Karma and Amy are dying to get back together,<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> but they're both too stubborn to back down. - What did you do now? I knew I just had to get them in the same room and, voila!<eos> - And you think they're just gonna make up?<eos> - What did you do now? - What show have you been watching? - What did you do now?<eos> Those two can't stay mad at each other. - What did you do now? It's only a matter of time before their teary reunion.<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> Oh, here we go. - What did you do now?<eos> [playful music] - What did you do now? Grab your Kleenex.<eos> - What did you do now? ♪ ♪ - What did you do now?
I've seen her and 20 more girls just like her.<eos> Don't be a jagoff, all right?<eos> We think she was abducted from here.<eos> I'm saying a lot of girls her age come and go.<eos> I don't keep track.<eos> You have surveillance cameras here?<eos> Think the guy who owns this place cares about his employees?<eos> Does he?<eos> I haven't met the guy.<eos> He doesn't.
Justin?<eos> Mm? Ah, yeah.<eos> I'm fine. I'm absolutely fucking dandy.<eos> How was the hunting trip?<eos> Great, yeah.<eos> We caught a bloody big bear.<eos> Wow! With your little stick?<eos> Yeah. I just grabbed him by the 'orns and stuck it in.<eos> Right. Not sure bears have horns.<eos> This one did.
I hope you weren't waiting up for me.<eos> Your father never really liked the tire business.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, it wasn't in his blood or anything like that.<eos> But why would anyone have tires in their blood... stinky tires, for God's sake?<eos> It was just a business he could support his family with.<eos> Your dad was in the family business.<eos> What brought all of this on?<eos> I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist.<eos> I really didn't, Amantha.
I know that.<eos> I can't not be upset sometimes.<eos> I know that, too, Teddy.<eos> It just frightens me, your anger.<eos> I'm not angry, I'm upset!<eos> You don't need a husband.<eos> You need a saint.<eos> Okay, we probably went too far.<eos> They want me to see somebody.<eos> Who does?
That right?<eos> Do you want one?<eos> No, I'm fine, thanks.<eos> Fresh and hot.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it weird being here?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Remember that big ol' picture we used to have up here?<eos> I do.
Figuring things out, aren't we?<eos> What things?<eos> Our lives.<eos> Don't we have some things already figured out?<eos> If we're being honest.<eos> Some things.<eos> Not everything.<eos> I don't want to corner you, Tawney.<eos> Hem you in, put you on the spot anymore.<eos> I really don't. I...
Oh, she may already be here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You gonna go back and see her?<eos> At the fun house?<eos> She traveled a long way.<eos> Trey went back where?<eos> That's what I asked Bobby.<eos> He said that's all George said.<eos> He asked me to pass a message on to Daniel, too.<eos> Bobby did.
Nothing to worry about here," and then it's pineapples in Paris.<eos> - Please stop saying that.<eos> - I take one step forward and, bam, land mine, just like I suspected.<eos> You're full of intuition, Ted.<eos> What can I say?<eos> God, you resent me, don't you?<eos> What?<eos> You're filled with resentment for me.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> I do.
So, what did you sign up for?<eos> The car wash or the pancake breakfast?<eos> I actually didn't sign up for anything yet.<eos> Maybe I should.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> And by that you mean...?<eos> Do you go to school here?<eos> No, Emma, but I'm thinking about it.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Doesn't everyone?
Whatever you're thinking, just stop.<eos> Nothing good happens in Burbank.<eos> If I don't come back, you know where to find me.<eos> Well, this is a pleasant surprise.<eos> Nobody's home?<eos> Come on.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Well, you know how your mother is.<eos> No, I don't.
You know, sometimes you turn into the most serious person I've ever known.<eos> Okay, I didn't come here to be insulted.<eos> Not all the time.<eos> Just lately.<eos> Since you've been spending time in Rosewood.<eos> Yeah, well, it can have that effect on you.<eos> Then why do you keep going back there?<eos> - Do you know what I wanna do? - What do you wanna do?<eos> Do you remember that bar off Columbus where we first met?<eos> Yes, I do.
We both know that.<eos> How's Hanna?<eos> I haven't talked to her.<eos> Emily said she got a text that she was going to New York.<eos> I guess she wanted to see Jordan.<eos> I am afraid to ask you this, but I really have to.<eos> Did we make a mistake?<eos> You and I?<eos> No.<eos> No, we didn't.
Look, Spencer is right.<eos> Just come on.<eos> What are we gonna do with them?<eos> She's in shock.<eos> It will wear off.<eos> Hanna...<eos> Maybe you should go wait in the car with Alison.<eos> Seriously, we got it. Just go sit in the car.<eos> No, I need to help.<eos> Okay, because if I don't do something, then...

Wh-What's going on?<eos> What's going on is that Mr. Gardner has an abdominal tumor the size of a grapefruit.<eos> We need to get this thing out immediately.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Wes, when did the stomach pains begin?<eos> When you left me, Cathy.<eos> When you broke my heart.<eos> That's sort of when the pain started.<eos> Wait. You guys used to go out?<eos> Um, yes, we did. As a matter of fact.
The only regret I have is that I don't get to see your face when you finally die, Chanel.<eos> Good-bye, Chanels.<eos> Have fun in hell.<eos> Oh, by the way, I heard there are no dinosaurs!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I guess we should take this moment, perhaps, to let go of some old grudges.<eos> Screw that, I am going out guns blazing!<eos> Wait! Wait a minute!<eos> You're alive, that means my cryo-chamber worked!<eos> Damn right it did, crunchy Munsch.
Careful, quicksand.<eos> Somebody! Drop me a rope!<eos> Come on!<eos> This is a horrible way to die.<eos> Look, in my experience, costumed serial killers are never adequately punished by the law.<eos> Sometimes vigilante justice is the only way.<eos> I'm with Chanel.<eos> She killed my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, so I suppose no one cares that your boyfriend murdered my boyfriend? !<eos> No! No one does. All right.
If we want to talk to someone, we ask them to come and see us voluntarily.<eos> - He's involved in this, Laura.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - The murders began when he got in touch with the outside world.<eos> - He's supervised.<eos> He's been seeing a psychologist for several years.<eos> I've read his report.<eos> He's file a complaint for harassment. His lawyers are involved.<eos> - We have no grounds to continue inv<eos> - Yes, we do.
No, we should do it together.<eos> Our daughter's taking drugs.<eos> She's reacting to our breakup.<eos> - You told them?<eos> - Well, someone had to.<eos> - She's 13, Marcella.<eos> - She blames me, she listens to you.<eos> - And it is your fault.<eos> - If that makes you feel better then...<eos> No, it doesn't.
Women and children, huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> You did it, didn't you? You did it!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
- 12. Give me 12 hours, Laura.<eos> Please.<eos> Laura.<eos> You've got until tomorrow morning.<eos> Then we've got to let him go.<eos> - Coffee.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You were right.<eos> All his alibis held up.<eos> Of course they do.
Do you think we can use it against Amara?<eos> What is this?<eos> The Rod of Aaron.<eos> A Hand of God.<eos> If we're gonna fight her, what better way to arm up than with an actual dose of His power?<eos> It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.<eos> Noel, I came when you asked.<eos> You're looking a trifle peaky.<eos> Do you truly have it?<eos> And it's yours... if you hold up your end of the bargain.<eos> I've had a good life... thanks to you.<eos> Very few of the world's secrets I haven't cracked.<eos> It seemed worth a soul... at the time.<eos> It always does.
When we sprung Lucifer from the Cage, we had Rowena and the Book of the Damned.<eos> Both of which we will need to put him back in the Cage, both of which are gone.<eos> Guys.<eos> Guys. Look at this.<eos> I hate this.<eos> And, by the way, where the hell is Crowley?<eos> I mean, we're essentially all set up.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he's the one that boxed us into doing this.<eos> You'd think he'd have the decency to -- Show up?<eos> He does.
See, isn't this better than some boring dinner party?<eos> Uh, I thought you said we were just stopping by.<eos> For five scrumptious courses prepared by my personal chef.<eos> Now sit, sit, everyone, sit.<eos> Open your swag bags.<eos> They contain all the essentials for an epic bachelor party.<eos> (quietly):<eos> What the hell's happening?<eos> Rogelio, you really didn't have to do this.<eos> Of course I did.
This is our chance to be like the Olsen twins. But less depressing.<eos> And without Mary-Kate's weird old French guy.<eos> Fine, let's go! Yes!<eos> Awesome!<eos> Break out the booze!<eos> We're doing shots!<eos> No, no shots. MEN: Shot!<eos> Shot! LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Truth be told, if Derek knew his boat was being searched, he probably wouldn't feel so buoyed.<eos> But alas, he doesn't.
Okay, then I'll cut to the chase.<eos> I want to work at MacMillan Utility.<eos> Want is very different than need.<eos> - Okay, I need to work here.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I'm fascinated by antivirus software. I'm not. It bores me.<eos> Okay, um, because you set the gold standard and you're looking for your next challenge.<eos> I am, too.<eos> What makes you think you know what I'm looking for?<eos> I don't.
Could be.<eos> Or it could be that all the guys that were out there when I was a kid are too busy running companies to have time for hams.<eos> Yeah, or they moved online.<eos> There must be some new kids out there.<eos> I'll be out in a sec.<eos> CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Do you love your wife?<eos> You've had sex with her twice.<eos> At least.<eos> I do love her.<eos> The sex... not so much.<eos> She know?<eos> About you?<eos> About you.<eos> I hide all the time.<eos> All of us do, in this culture.
I thought losing my...<eos> Emma... was the worst thing ever... ever... but all those children...<eos> I killed them.<eos> No.<eos> They made me into a murderer... and she's still gone.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> You haven't slept for days.<eos> I want to sleep forever.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
You think you scare me?<eos> You collaborating piece of shit!<eos> Take another step.<eos> Take one more step!<eos> Stand down.<eos> We have every right to be here!<eos> I said stand down.<eos> You want to shoot me?<eos> Shoot me!<eos> Do it!
This is going to be a long war.<eos> Every war is longer than you think it's going to be.<eos> You'll be strongest on your first day, And every day after that, you'll get weaker And they'll get stronger.<eos> You're going to be mired in Syria, which is their territory.<eos> You think you know fervor, General?<eos> This is an end-of-days cult.<eos> You have no idea what real fervor is.<eos> Unless you overwhelm them from the start, you're gonna fight them to a draw at best, Which means they win.<eos> And you've got one chance to get it right.<eos> So until then, he does nothing?
Nothing else.<eos> I understand.<eos> What is going on In Abuddin makes it even more important for us To put the pressure on.<eos> This American is not going to be President forever, and before he steps aside, We need to encourage him to make a war he's going to regret.<eos> Your plan for Al-Qadi Backfired.<eos> Instead of making the American more powerful, It created an alliance against him.<eos> Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab, Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
No, thanks.<eos> I thought you weren't hungry.<eos> Did you ever imagine when you were, I don't know, getting stoned every morning, that you'd end up a soldier in my dad's army?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Our dad's army.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Has anyone told my mom?<eos> Given what she's gone through, it seems a little soon.<eos> She deserves to know.<eos> She does.
You're not safe, either.<eos> You can't stay... but someone has to, otherwise it looks like we've given up.<eos> I can take the risk.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> I'm his best friend and he's having me arrested.<eos> What makes you think...<eos> He's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with you.<eos> I-I didn't know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
Not it!<eos> Not it!<eos> Not it!<eos> I'm it.<eos> All right, let's all go, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, yogi bear.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Hurry up, guys. We don't have all night.<eos> Maybe we do.
The friend I was working with...<eos> We were in MI6 together. He just phoned.<eos> It turns out that the job wasn't legit.<eos> Something bigger is going on, something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.<eos> Uh, what does Code 44 mean?<eos> It means abandon everything and everyone.<eos> It means run for your life and don't look back.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - I have no choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Sounds healthy.<eos> The point is this. There was no book club.<eos> Turns out, she'd park her car down by the river so she could cry, alone.<eos> And then something happened.<eos> She stopped making excuses to be somewhere else.<eos> And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
She failed to mention that by giving Bonnie her life, she was actually giving Bonnie her lifestyle.<eos> So now when Bonnie wakes up, she's gonna be Rayna 2.0.<eos> And does that gift begin with a very long nap?<eos> I didn't get a chance to ask as she burst into flames.<eos> And before you ask, no, I did not get a chance to interrogate her little shaman friend, because he vanished at the same time.<eos> Damon, did the spell work or not? !<eos> I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
He got drunk and enlisted so he wouldn't lose his job or get killed on account of being a Serb.<eos> Come on, he wouldn't have been killed.<eos> That used to happen, professor.<eos> Maybe. occasionally.<eos> Not just occasionally.<eos> Innocent people got hurt.<eos> I went nuts.<eos> Him with a machine gun in Banija and me 4 months pregnant.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you had a child.<eos> We don't.
Something wrong? - - What.. no...<eos> You look baffled.<eos> You're not how I pictured you. When you hear someone on the phone you make your own image of him...<eos> How did you picture me?<eos> Did you bring the brooch? - - Yes.<eos> You see the hair?<eos> Why didn't you give this to the police?<eos> I was... 8 years old.<eos> I thought this belonged to my little girlfriend.<eos> - - But it didn't.
No it is too late to move anything.<eos> Black claw will be watching.<eos> Hide it the best you can.<eos> What about the opening to the old sewer line?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't think anybody would look down there.<eos> I know i wouldn't.<eos> Okay then get back to the loft.<eos> Hopefully we'll have nick by then.<eos> And if you don't?
This is me.<eos> Really?<eos> This -- This pile of self-doubt and nebbishness flooded the Earth?<eos> Followed up Sodom with a blockbuster Gomorrah?<eos> Created as much as he punished?<eos> Unh-unh! The guy I worked for -- total badass!<eos> And yes, he could be a dick.<eos> Now, that guy... had some stories to tell.<eos> And he has a lot to answer for.<eos> Okay, so what do I do?
♪ But don't forget that love's a game ♪ I know.<eos> ♪ And it can always come again ♪ I'm gonna go get you some water.<eos> Chuck?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought --<eos> I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
"Bandy legs".<eos> "As I was going to sell my eggs,<eos> I met the man with bandy legs.<eos> Bandy legs and crooked toes..."<eos> "bandy legs and crooked toes, I tripped us heels and he fell on..."<eos> show yourself!<eos> Don't come any closer!<eos> - Steady.<eos> He means me no harm.<eos> - Yes, I do!
As-salamu alayki, Sharbat.<eos> Wa'alikum asalaam.<eos> Thank you both.<eos> There you go.<eos> Let's go, boys!<eos> So, they found a safe house in Kabul?<eos> Then they got to walk across the Pakistan border, take a bus to Karachi, fly to Jakarta, and sail to Christmas Island.<eos> Wow. Think they'll make it?<eos> They have a chance.<eos> They didn't before.
A conspiracy theory?<eos> That's why we're all here?<eos> Excuse me, Master Bruce.<eos> Pardon me, sir, might I have your name, please?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your name... please, sir.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Mr. Crowley, did your parents ever teach you any manners?<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Oh, but you do, sir!
- Had a kid Odell's age.<eos> Didn't want to risk her identifying with him.<eos> - Used a preempt. - Mm.<eos> You didn't preempt Keith Johnson.<eos> He had a 17-year-old child, as well, but he was white.<eos> Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
You know, the fact that so much time has passed now, you don't even have to disclose those deaths when you sell.<eos> Wait, is that true?<eos> Abby?<eos> Ready when you are, Abbs.<eos> Abbs?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Whew. Did you think I was in the coffin?<eos> Uh...<eos> If the shoe fits.<eos> It didn't.
One -- put aside your personal feelings when assessing a client.<eos> Two -- he was bankrupted by this case.<eos> Because he fired like 10 of his attorneys when they told him to take a plea deal.<eos> Five of his attorneys, and don't speak unless called on.<eos> Now, we're joining this mid-trial.<eos> The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
What can I say? I'm used to working with women who get paid by the hour.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Ms. Pratt.<eos> She's just joining our team.<eos> You hit on her... and I'll cut off your balls.<eos> - Ms. Perez, what type of information were you able to gather about the defendant, his Internet activity in particular?<eos> On average, Mr. Solomon procured an escort three times a week.<eos> He also had a blog where he graded the women based on factors such as breast size, pubic hair, and vocal enthusiasm.<eos> I was young.<eos> I don't do that anymore.
You protect me.<eos> And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's... How's Meggy?<eos> Huh? Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Oh. Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
You're the owner and manager of Duvall's Kitchen. Edith poisoned herself.<eos> That's insane.<eos> She must've known about Karen's secret e-mails - and did it to herself.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> Let's just say I can understand why a mother would want to punish her ungrateful children.<eos> Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
Any questions for me, Wes?<eos> Did I pass?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I've been cleared to testify.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
As a mother, I feel helpless watching my son be persecuted for a crime he did not commit.<eos> As a citizen, I feel anger towards the system that allows innocent people...<eos> What you reading?<eos> To be wrongfully imprisoned.<eos> Just the news.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> What?<eos> If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?<eos> Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- and not like him.<eos> - You do know me.<eos> Parts of you, but guess what, Connor...<eos> I want to know everything about the guy that I'm with...<eos> The good and the bad...<eos> That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
And you said nothing.<eos> Sam wouldn't let me.<eos> You had all those months to apologize, and all you can do is blame Sam.<eos> You killed my son. That was you.<eos> And you had the nerve...<eos> The nerve to stay in my life.<eos> Make me trust you, take care of you.<eos> I just want to fix this.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> How do you do that, Frank?
You made your point!<eos> - Pull that trigger!<eos> - She can't survive this.<eos> - Pull it! Do it!<eos> - I can't survive this.<eos> - Pull the trigger!<eos> - Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it! Pull it!<eos> - Please don't do it!<eos> - Do it!
- Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it! Pull it!<eos> - Please don't do it!<eos> - Do it!<eos> Do it for me! - Don't, please!<eos> Don't!<eos> - Don't do it!<eos> - Pull it!<eos> Do it!<eos> - Do it! Do it!
But it would be perfectly normal behavior for a friend.<eos> I appreciate you, everyone looking out for me.<eos> But I can't just stand by and do nothing.<eos> Look, I know that my current state makes me a liability, but I'm wondering if there's anything that you can do for me.<eos> I wish I could too, but...<eos> I know you can't solve this.<eos> So all I'm asking for is a temporary fix.<eos> Something that'll let me do more than just sit back on this ship while the others risk their lives for me.<eos> I don't believe the others have a problem with that.<eos> Maybe not, but I sure as hell do.
But I know it was important.<eos> Then why didn't you just ask him what he said?<eos> He walks up. He looks at me.<eos> He practically screws me with his eyes... and whispers something that I know was amazing in my ear, and I'm supposed to say...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe you didn't want to know what he said.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm gonna have to live the rest of my life never knowing what he said tonight.<eos> I mean, what if he said he loved me?<eos> What if he did?
If your father was a gangster, would you want to find out by e-mail?<eos> My father was a gangster and I found out when I was 13.<eos> Your father's a gangster?<eos> Well, a bookie.<eos> Tony "The Bat."<eos> And guess what he liked to use on people who didn't pay up.<eos> Anyway, the point is that I got over it, and I even became a cop, but-but we don't know how this guy is gonna react to that, and the fact that his dad is still alive?<eos> I say we don't find out.<eos> No, I-I... I have to tell him to his face.<eos> Of course you do.
You ever hear of Edmund Kemper, the Co-Ed Killer?<eos> Sure, why?<eos> He killed his mother, and shortly after that, he turned himself in.<eos> He said that killing her allowed him to surrender.<eos> I get it now.<eos> You think he's gonna turn himself in.<eos> He may have.<eos> But now his actions have become more erratic, more intensified since he killed his mother on that boat.<eos> Good, 'cause I don't want him to stain his routine.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
I said stop right there!<eos> I said stop!<eos> This is foot post 11-02, in pursuit of a bag-snatch suspect.<eos> Headed west on Sullivan and Ferris.<eos> There you go.<eos> Smart move, man. I didn't do it.<eos> Yeah, you can save that for the judge, man.<eos> I saw you snatch that bag.<eos> No, that's not what I mean.<eos> I didn't do that.
Well, we're not entirely sure that's what happened.<eos> There's a good chance that, uh, both men were killed by the same person.<eos> No.<eos> Nope, I've never seen this man before.<eos> Um... is this Jared's desk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Don't interfere... give Minal the phone<eos> Yeah, but I had already spoken to Vishwa, we'll<eos> Falak, where is that ***** Minal, I want her to apologise.<eos> Rajvir, please...<eos> Please don't talk like that.<eos> Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
She stopped or tried to stop you you forced her so she hit you back.<eos> That's a possibility?<eos> - Yes<eos> But that's not what happened that night.<eos> Ohh...sorry.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> You're getting married.<eos> To MLA Janki Ram's daughter.<eos> What does my personal life have to do with this case?<eos> Nothing but neither did the personal lives of my clients.
- What is it, Mr. Prashant?<eos> His clients have admitted to solici... - Alright, sit down.<eos> Carry on, Mr. Deepak.<eos> Okay, let me ask you another question?<eos> Once you saw that Minal is making a drink for herself Didn't you feel that she might be one of 'those' girls and you should leave!<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink. Your mother?<eos> Your sister? Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
They beat me, Dad.<eos> Calm down, I'm here now.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here. I'm here.<eos> It was I who took the photo.<eos> Why did you do that? He wanted reactions. But I did not think I would go so far.<eos> - Are you in love with him?<eos> So why did you kiss? I did not do it. It was he who wanted.<eos> Since coming to school, he fell in love with me. He kept following me at that party. The only way to get rid of it was to kiss him.<eos> So I did.
Stop it. Stop!<eos> Jin-young.<eos> Why?<eos> Why'd you lie to me?<eos> Why'd you play me like you didn't know me?<eos> You stop it, Suk-won.<eos> You remember everything now, don't you? Yeah, I do.<eos> But.<eos> Why'd you hide everything from me?<eos> I didn't.
A lot of people are saying this is why.<eos> District Attorney Wallace came to the rescue.<eos> I can understand why people would think that, but that's not true.<eos> I'm very lucky that the district attorney thought enough of my legal skills to put me in charge of the Conviction Integrity Unit.<eos> It's my second chance, much like the second chances my team and I are giving people whose convictions we really want to investigate.<eos> But there's a real difference here.<eos> The people whose cases you're reviewing...<eos> They went through the system.<eos> They faced a jury of their peers.<eos> You did no such thing.
They're gone.<eos> So your friends were unsuccessful?<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> They're still on board.<eos> What about Lin and Boone?<eos> We have them.<eos> Far from ideal.<eos> Okay, Emperor... coming to you.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Okay, look... Yeah, I've had a bad day, and maybe we can just... pick it up again tomorrow, all right?<eos> Can't believe you still fall for that.<eos> Later, loser.<eos> You tested the device without making the proper adjustments.<eos> You didn't account for temporal displacement.<eos> That's why you and the rest of your crew are here.<eos> Instead of going from point A to point B in your reality, you punched a hole through space-time and ended up here, where our Ishida reclaimed his throne.<eos> Something you obviously haven't done... not yet.<eos> Mind you, I don't know how you're gonna do that without the Blink Drive.<eos> Well, how did he do it?
This is just not how I expected things to go.<eos> I mean, we lose patients all the time.<eos> It's just, sometimes there's...<eos> Yeah, sometimes you just find one that really gets to you.<eos> Yeah. I understand.<eos> You know, she wasn't afraid of dying.<eos> She just faced it head on.<eos> I mean, I wish I had that kind of strength.<eos> Hey.<eos> You do.
Yo, I got to make up for lost time.<eos> Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He doesn't.
Yeah, sh-- she said that a mother knows these things.<eos> Oh, well, if a mother knows.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, just out of curiosity, how does a secret meet-up like that end? Huh?<eos> With a sad but loving farewell blowjob?<eos> Look, I- - I don't know what else to say to you.<eos> Look, I came here hoping to, I don't know, make some kind of amends.<eos> Yeah, so when you're ready for that, you know, let me know.<eos> T.J.! Hi.<eos> How you doing?
I'm saying if you do something and you don't ask me why I'll come home.<eos> This is it.<eos> That's where he works.<eos> Wait here.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I want to see this.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
She should know where she came from.<eos> You remember what else we agreed to?<eos> - No? - Mnh-mnh.<eos> One girl, one boy.<eos> We can't afford another kid.<eos> Well, I'm workin 'on that.<eos> What do you say after this next job, we take off to the mountains?<eos> Get a cabin like we used to?<eos> You want a baby brother?<eos> You do?
Just a guy you call when you need something up north?<eos> No.<eos> You're an old friend who's doing me a favor... because I paid you.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> How's Craig?<eos> Fine.<eos> That's all I get?<eos> Look, my boys don't know about this, and I don't want 'em to.<eos> He still look like me?<eos> He never did.
I don't give a shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Remember when he wasn't an asshole?<eos> Okay. Ready?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um...<eos> I started taking Oxy.<eos> And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
I've loved Baz since I was 16.<eos> I can't turn on him.<eos> What would that make me?<eos> Think carefully, Catherine.<eos> Walk away now, next time you see me, I'm cuffing you.<eos> I'll take that chance.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I figured I'd scared you off.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Ray.
And you would have me leave my Mathilda here?<eos> She lit her candle<eos> Can you trust her, Reid?<eos> She is my daughter.<eos> And I must say goodbye.<eos> Your advice, Captain, was a conclusion I had already reached unaided.<eos> We tried.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> We can see that, at least.<eos> We did.
September the 20th, 2010.<eos> You were not yet in the habit of using taxis.<eos> You were driving home from a bar when you struck and killed a pedestrian.<eos> Your blood alcohol content was measured at .13.<eos> You were arrested for vehicular homicide in the second degree and sentenced to four years at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility.<eos> On the plus side, your prints landed in AFIS.<eos> When you were in prison, there was not one single bombing in New York. You got out July 2015.<eos> 13 months later, the Bensonhurst Bomber starts blowing things up again.<eos> You have to admit, that's a little strange.<eos> No, I don't.
Now, don't worry, after your interviews and your polygraphs, most of you will keep your jobs, but it just probably won't be here.<eos> I realize this is a lot to process, so we're going to try and make this transition as quick and painless as possible.<eos> It's obviously going to take a few days to complete the handover, during which time<eos> I ask for your continued cooperation and patience.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
We got drone approval.<eos> Move!<eos> G, up here!<eos> Come, come, come!<eos> Drone footage coming online now.<eos> And I'm being told an osprey is heading towards our guys.<eos> It'll never make it in time.<eos> Beale, is that drone armed?<eos> Yes, sir, but we have no authority to order a strike.<eos> But Duggan does.
'Cause the Corbett's being controlled by a satellite that's above them.<eos> It's top-down...<eos> I'm gonna clean up some more confetti.<eos> Top-down?<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> We can't destroy the satellite because the missiles are grounded, but if we can disrupt the satellite's signal before it gets to the ship, then we can regain control of the destroyer.<eos> But even if we disrupt the signal, you can't reprogram the Corbett's computers without physically being on the boat.<eos> You try to go out to that destroyer, Walt, I guarantee you the hackers will use the ship's weaponry to turn you into Swiss cheese.<eos> And it's moot, anyway, because we have no way to disrupt the hackers' sat signal to the ship.<eos> Yes, we do.
Not good.<eos> He's gonna need surgery as soon as he gets in.<eos> He's just a kid.<eos> He only joined the force about three months ago.<eos> Guy... guy barely shaves.<eos> Yeah, I don't think the other kid does, either.<eos> Well, that kid fired on us.<eos> We didn't have a choice.<eos> You think I feel good about that?<eos> Nobody does!
It wasn't just them.<eos> That guy, the dispatch, these are his mission orders.<eos> From General Ulysses S. Grant.<eos> My God.<eos> He was supposed to infiltrate the Collins Plantation and steal Confederate troop movement orders.<eos> They named a high school after him?<eos> That's because in the original version of history, the plans Scott stole helped Grant win the Battle of Champion Hill.<eos> And I'm guessing none of that happened because Scott was bayonetted by a Confederate turned into a zombie by a future virus.<eos> Okay, so... how do we fix it?<eos> We don't.

You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.<eos> The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Of course.<eos> This isn't my first rodeo.<eos> @ ~ I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.
At least you're not throwing up.<eos> - What's it doing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Either our food's ready or this guy's trying to call us.<eos> Hey, how... how do... How do I answer?<eos> Oh, my God. It's him.<eos> He's even uglier than the last time we saw him.<eos> 65 of your years ago, you saved me from capture.<eos> Listen, you don't need to thank us.<eos> Yeah, he does.
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?<eos> Where is he?<eos> My dear, that information comes at a cost.<eos> Don't look so glum, professor.<eos> You'll be in good company at the bottom of this here river.<eos> Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops, they've all run afoul in my organization, but you...<eos> I've never had to whack a professor before.<eos> Guess I'm moving up in the world, hey, boys?<eos> The speedster, how did you manage to defeat him?<eos> I didn't.
- Stop! - Me?<eos> - You did it, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> The lamppost. You did it, didn't you?<eos> What? No, no, no, stop.<eos> - You're a liar! - Julian!<eos> - You're a meta-human.<eos> - Stop, no, stop!<eos> You put your foster father in the hospital, didn't you?<eos> - Didn't you?
After Dad died.<eos> I did everything I could to save your father.<eos> Well, you lost your daughter at the same time.<eos> You're the one who went away, Caitlin.<eos> Because I had to. You realize you never acted like my mother again after Dad got sick?<eos> You would barely even look at me.<eos> I... couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.<eos> Power... yes, the monster.<eos> That's... ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R. - Can't be it... - 'Cause we would have detected<eos> - a surge in the power grid.<eos> - We did not.
Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Caitlin. Come on... gah!<eos> - How much does it hurt?<eos> - As much as I deserve.<eos> Okay. Let me know.<eos> They took Julian to County General.<eos> He's still out cold.<eos> How hard did you hit him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't mean to knock him out.<eos> Or maybe I did.
Barr, it's the hospital.<eos> Julian's awake.<eos> He knows it was me.<eos> He knows what I did.<eos> Don't worry. I'll talk to him.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
No, man.<eos> That's on you.<eos> Because you don't trust us, because you don't want us.<eos> Ok, this is a setback, but we can salvage this.<eos> They'll listen to you.<eos> Can you just tell them how Oliver usually approaches things and--<eos> I tried that.<eos> I told them all about how you and Speedy and Spartan were a family, and even though you were tough and scary and even a little abusive, they clearly trusted you because they stood by you.<eos> But then it hit me.<eos> No, they didn't.
It's over.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Your offer sounded intriguing.<eos> Why did you make it?<eos> Why'd you give up your vengeance to save my life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think it's what my father would have wanted me to do.<eos> He saved my life.<eos> On Genesis day, he... wrapped me in these rags, said they were ancient, from the time of Devarim, that they would protect me from the fire.<eos> And they did.
Such as looking for anagrams in case Prometheus was sending a message in the names of the victims he's been choosing.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Ahh. First 4 victims--<eos> Tobias Church, Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, and Gay Eked.<eos> Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
What makes you so sure?<eos> Because that guy with the list wouldn't have even thought to ask the question.<eos> I need a cleanup on aisle 12, and also, I got a list of potential victims.<eos> I know you're all upset with me, so thank you for showing up despite that.<eos> Well, we were afraid you would kill us if we didn't.<eos> Heh. Too soon?<eos> Probably.<eos> I was able to cross-reference the list with the city census, nailing it down to 6 potential targets.<eos> How do we know who he'll hit?<eos> We don't.
My fiancée's name is Anna... or was.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're remembering.<eos> Son, don't you think you should be getting your tuxedo on?<eos> Are you all right, Oliver?<eos> I just need to speak with Thea.<eos> I think I saw her talking to Malcolm over by the ice sculpture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Son... I think you need to clam down.<eos> We both do.
Help!<eos> Somebody, help us!<eos> Please!<eos> Help!<eos> - Hey. - How you feeling?<eos> Like someone threw a throwing star at me, kicked me down a flight of steps, and knocked me out.<eos> The doctor said you're not supposed to sit up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the doc doesn't know me that well.<eos> Not sure I do anymore either.
He went out to track down a lead, didn't come back, his missed his last 3 call-ins,<eos> GPS on his phone's been switched off.<eos> Do you think he's dead?<eos> I think that every cop that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.<eos> Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions.<eos> Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
Well, I don't want to risk interrupting you two love birds in the middle of you know what, and it looks like I have interrupted you in the middle of you know... what and with a melon.<eos> My, my. Not judging, but room temperature.<eos> - Mother. - I...<eos> What... What is it you want?<eos> I want for my son to grant me a very simple wish.<eos> Now, it seems that my publisher says that for my self-help book to make the best-seller list, I need a celebrity endorsement and not just any celebrity endorsement... the endorsement of endorsements.<eos> Mother, I would be happy to write something for your book.<eos> I need Oprah.<eos> Uh, do you even know Oprah?<eos> No, I do not.
No, Lars did not double-cross me.<eos> He got double-crossed by the shipper.<eos> Okay, well, really, the smuggler.<eos> You can't just walk past customs with priceless relics and expect no one to notice, right?<eos> So, Lars hired a guy back in Turkey to ship the items back?<eos> What was his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do know.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I do...
- You're sitting in the dark,<eos> - your truck's nowhere to be seen.<eos> - 'Cause I don't want to be seen.<eos> - It's basically the definition...<eos> - It's about your boss.<eos> - It's a little hard to believe.<eos> - Is it?<eos> How much did Sheriff Wilkins receive in, uh, campaign donations from Newett Energy last election?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Bring it here. I can't help but wonder how this is going to play...<eos> You gave me the knife, buddy, and I gutted them from belly to chin.<eos> - All right, here it comes. - Mm-hmm. The coup de grâce.<eos> Senator Healy offered me anything I wanted to cross the aisle... appointments, PAC money, even the gavel.<eos> He needs to stop using the shutdown to play games, and make no mistake...<eos> She swallowed it, hook, line and sinker.<eos> ...appointments, PAC money, even the gavel...<eos> Wait, you said he called Barneki.<eos> Barneki was the odd man out.<eos> He did.
Not if I can help it.<eos> Have you ever heard the name aaron kim? Yeah.<eos> He's one of the people hobbs helped smuggle into the u.S.<eos> Okay, he was killed this morning.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> I'd met him.<eos> They sent a version of me to kill everyone on the hobbs list, And now you want my help.<eos> Jennifer, it has nothing...<eos> Jennifer? She never told you<eos> No, she didn't.
It was, it was easier.<eos> It helped me reconcile not being a part of your life.<eos> I'm So sorry...<eos> It's not a sad story.<eos> I mean, some kids never know the love that I had with my mother.<eos> Well, I missed the opportunity to be your father.<eos> So maybe someday...<eos> I'm suspected of being a north korean spy.<eos> Are those the friends you tend to keep?<eos> I don't...
This surveillence video is from the western annex of the bottling facility.<eos> The fire was nowhere near this location, and yet...<eos> Do we know who this guy is?<eos> Well, firefighters generally have their names printed on the bottom of their turnout jackets, but this bag is blocking it, and happens to be the perfect size for two stolen hard drives.<eos> After this, we lose him.<eos> We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
You cleared me.<eos> Look, I'm out of here, man.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Look, I need your help.<eos> I don't think I can solve Greene's murder without it.<eos> My memory, it...<eos> I get confused.<eos> I... you don't know what's it's like in my head.<eos> No, no, you're right.<eos> I-I-I don't but...
Well, give me a second.<eos> Are you sure you can do this?<eos> Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?<eos> I buried it there, so we could go home.<eos> Wait, that's it. Wow.<eos> Isn't that the best?<eos> You guys made a person.<eos> We did.<eos> And I like to think I helped.<eos> You didn't.
Somebody was trying to rescue the animal from the circus.<eos> I did get a pretty good screen-grab of one of the people involved.<eos> That's great.<eos> But why are we whispering?<eos> Because.<eos> It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.<eos> They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.<eos> Until the part where the elephant got away.<eos> Great, but I thought you said you got a clear picture of him.<eos> I did.
Stockman's anxious to get moving.<eos> He needs to relax.<eos> I'm not done here.<eos> All right, let me help.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> What's taking them so long?<eos> Asking that every minute ain't gonna get them here any faster.<eos> Oh, I'd shut up if I were you.<eos> You got a problem with me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Anyways, the food fest was amazing.<eos> I made so much tips, and, uh, Kamekona, he, uh... yeah, he won best original dish for, uh, that, uh, that, uh, three-alarm chili shrimp dog.<eos> Yeah, that was so good.<eos> So, uh, what... what'd you want to talk to me about?<eos> Sit down for a sec.<eos> Uh, I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> He wasn't really a good person.<eos> Yeah, he was still your father.<eos> I got no more family left.<eos> Yeah, you do, pal.
You?<eos> You created Poopie Penguin?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What's Poopie Penguin?<eos> That's right.<eos> What's Poopie Penguin?<eos> What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?<eos> Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points. Penguins don't fly.<eos> No.<eos> They do in my universe.
Just a couple spoonfuls.<eos> Yeah, Kelly, come on.<eos> All right.<eos> How awesome is this?<eos> I love having roomies.<eos> It's all yours, Hirsch.<eos> Hey-o. Second responder.<eos> Yo, dude, you didn't carry that all the way up the stairs, did you?<eos> You know there's a dumbwaiter, right?<eos> No, I did not.
Worked well for both of us last time, right?<eos> They're in the car?<eos> These cats are shot callers for 18th Street.<eos> They ain't got a lot of love for people who help the police.<eos> Step lightly.<eos> Tony, Julio.<eos> Alderman Matt Casey.<eos> Appreciate y'all hearing him out.<eos> The reason that I ran for alderman is folks were tired of hearing half truths from politicians who didn't give a damn about this ward.<eos> I do.
Okay, yeah, you're right.<eos> But you did mess this up, Sarah.<eos> You really did.<eos> This is Silas.<eos> Send a pigeon.<eos> Silas, this is Cal.<eos> Call me back A-S-A-fucking-P.<eos> I don't care what Sarah told you.<eos> Do not give Freddie Ridge the medicine.<eos> We did it...
No.<eos> Yeah, I mean, they ended up not being there, but what if they were?<eos> I mean, what were... what were we gonna do?<eos> What, like, threaten them for the money or hurt them?<eos> We don't hurt people.<eos> Because it sure seemed like something serious was gonna go down if someone was there.<eos> Eddie, that's insane.<eos> Because I don't know.<eos> Maybe that's what we do, hurt people, now that Cal's in charge.<eos> No, we don't.
You hadn't spoken to your son in years when he died.<eos> Strangely, he called a month bef...<eos> He asked for a colleague's phone number, Dr. Alan Rothstein.<eos> He's a researcher at Stanford.<eos> And what did your son want with Dr. Rothstein?<eos> I didn't ask questions.<eos> I don't know, somewhere I had this hope, this stupid hope that the call was a sign that he wanted out, that... to come back, to be a real doctor, and I didn't want to push.<eos> Next thing I knew, he was dead.<eos> I have something to say to you.<eos> Apparently, the whole Lane family does.
'Cause the girls need you more than ever.<eos> They need their queen.<eos> And that's you.<eos> So what base did you get to?<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> I don't know what<eos> - Come on!<eos> - the bases are.<eos> - Just tell me.<eos> Of course you do.
He's in respiratory distress. Mollie, we need a bed in here!<eos> Okay. We can't.<eos> Just keep him on the gurney!<eos> Let's go. Take it, take it, take it!<eos> We got you, we got you.<eos> You paged me?<eos> It's... 2:00 A.M.<eos> Bri, you should be sleeping. I heard the nurses talking.<eos> They said I'm gonna get the transplant.<eos> Hmm. Of course, you did.
It just happened.<eos> - Come on, what do you think-- - Don't fucking touch me.<eos> Now, just tell me how you did it.<eos> Horace: Hey, it's a trick. Horace Sr:<eos> - I don't know any tricks.<eos> I just watch nature happen.<eos> - Nature?<eos> You fucking freak!<eos> What? My eyes didn't see that, all right?<eos> What did you do?
- Why not?<eos> - Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back.<eos> - He's- - Horace, he is not coming back. Horace.<eos> Pete is dead, Horace.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> You know, Horace, it's time.<eos> It's time for you to claim a fucking life.<eos> You sat out the first half, now it's time of you to make something of whatever time you fucking have left.<eos> - I didn't sit out my life.<eos> - No, no, you most certainly did.
Told you it'd be all right.<eos> Jehovah lit the path.<eos> It was His will.<eos> These doctors, maybe you should do every surgery this way.<eos> Mr. McCormick, you should know that there were complications with the surgery.<eos> What kind of complications?<eos> We had to use the bypass machine after all.<eos> I thought we made our wishes clear.<eos> Did they tell you they were doing this?<eos> They did.
Turn that up a little, will you?<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'd hoped to make it to the islands one more time.<eos> Flying's such a hassle these days.<eos> As soon as we can, we'll get you out of the ICU and into a room... one with a view.<eos> Hey, easy there.<eos> Dr. Rhodes...<eos> You know what I'm facing.<eos> I do.
Didi's a rad chalk artist.<eos> Could tag stuff around town, take selfies.<eos> #speakeasy2016.<eos> Guerilla marketing. I love it.<eos> Anybody seen the screwdriver?<eos> I want to go to military school.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Dom's dad went.<eos> I thought you and Dom broke up.<eos> We did.
Is she gonna be okay?<eos> We got our top doctors working on her.<eos> So as soon as I know more, I'll let you know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now, in the meantime, Nina, your social worker, is gonna come hang out with you.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> What's that?<eos> What...<eos> You don't like her?<eos> No, I do.
Adios. Adios. All right.<eos> You're both expected to make a full recovery thanks to the quick thinking and actions of doctors Alister and Jennings.<eos> Thank you so much for everything.<eos> I don't know how I can ever repay you.<eos> Well, the first one, you don't have to. And the second one, we've contacted some vet charities that are gonna step in and help out.<eos> Yeah, and, Riley, I believe you have some good news for Darika.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My dad's going to do Darika's repair for free at his surgery center.<eos> Oh, my god. You must have the greatest dad ever.<eos> I do.
Is that so unreasonable?<eos> The more you're dishonest with her, the worse it's gonna get.<eos> I thought it would be easier with a girl.<eos> Why would you ever think that?<eos> Mm? Get up.<eos> Let me sleep.<eos> I heard Alex in the garage.<eos> I think he got the shotgun.<eos> You don't have a shotgun.<eos> Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.
I was doing, like, a '20s thing, there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Your father's sleeping with Dina.<eos> Writer Dina?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He did the sex sniff.<eos> Okay, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to.<eos> Too late, I do.
- No.<eos> - The moon landing.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Fine, you're right.<eos> It's a completely random number.<eos> Look, the feds are useless.<eos> They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.<eos> I want to get home and see Amy.<eos> Don't you want to see Kevin?<eos> Of course I do.
The only thing I need you to do is...<eos> I'm not gonna show you my tattoo.<eos> Come on, just give me a hint.<eos> Is it an antique boat?<eos> Is it a musket?<eos> Is it me on a dragon?<eos> Sir, is it me on a dragon?<eos> Boom. $15,000 cash. Wow.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> Oh, you didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You really think it's necessary to take their phones and computers?<eos> What if Nick tries to get in touch with Mariana or Jesus?<eos> You don't think they would tell us?<eos> I'm not gonna risk it.<eos> Plus, with everything that's going around on Fost and Found.<eos> - How did Justina even find out about...<eos> - She didn't.
- He was embarrassed.<eos> - He should have been.<eos> - (knock on door) - I hope it's Brandon.<eos> He has a key.<eos> Hey, look, look, look, I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I...<eos> I don't.
Okay.<eos> We're friends of Kyle Snow.<eos> Do you remember him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He killed that lady, right?<eos> He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered.<eos> And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe he's the one that handles the finances.<eos> That's what Kelly did.<eos> Right before she left me.<eos> She started moving money around and hiding it.<eos> If I were paying more attention, I would have known she was gonna divorce me.<eos> Hey, why aren't you dancing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just too dumb, I guess.<eos> So, how could Molloy forget giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
What, you mean before I made us eligible and saved the day?<eos> Again.<eos> Oh, you call making complete fools of ourselves saving the day?<eos> Guys!<eos> It's probably just a loose wire.<eos> - Great!<eos> There's like 50 wires!<eos> - Jesus: Okay, I don't need this.<eos> - Mariana: Fine! Well, we don't need you.<eos> - Yes, we do.
It's tradition, but it's not a rule.<eos> And we've got a hanging arm, which you need to beat Palomar Alliance.<eos> Mariana.<eos> - Okay, deal.<eos> - Great.<eos> There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work. - Wait.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
- Emcee:<eos> - Can they do it in time?<eos> - two... - two...<eos> Anchor Beach did it! Anchor Beach did it!<eos> For the first time in four years, we have a new champion, Southern California.<eos> For the first time in four years, we have a new champion, Southern California.<eos> Brant Country Day, Anchor Beach, and High Tech LA came from defeat<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> So, the strategy that we used was to tell everybody that the arm worked.<eos> - Uh, because it did?
Are you crazy?<eos> - I can't believe you're still seeing Nick!<eos> - What does it matter if he thinks that I'm his girlfriend as long as he's locked up?<eos> Callie's caused Brandon a lot of trouble from the time she showed up. And what about this Aaron kid?<eos> Is she yanking his chain too?<eos> Hey, anybody home?<eos> Police.<eos> You were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> - Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Now where were we?<eos> Where were we? Yes, where were we?<eos> Um... Hey, hey, wait a minute!<eos> You only got one kit?<eos> Yeah, it's one kit per room.<eos> Yeah, but, uh, what if something happens to that kit?<eos> Don't we... don't we need a backup kit?<eos> Go get a backup kit.<eos> Gabi, you didn't even want a kit.<eos> Of course I did!
Fine. I'll be back in an hour.<eos> Thanks for pressing the button for me.<eos> My hands are so tired from... hand stuff.<eos> Since when do your hands get tired from hand stuff?<eos> I knew it!<eos> You're not wearing your wedding ring!<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> I know why.<eos> - You do?
Okay.<eos> So, your dad was an admiral?<eos> Yeah, four-star.<eos> Did he deploy a lot?<eos> Mm, all the time.<eos> I remember this one day, before he was gonna leave, I accidentally fell out of a tree, broke my arm.<eos> I was, uh, I was six years old and, uh, I remember my arm was killing me, but, uh, I was smiling all the way to the E.R.<eos> 'Cause you didn't think he'd leave if you were hurt.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Did he?
The Russians would rather have her dead than captured.<eos> That was our assumption, too.<eos> But since the target was neutralized, the mission was deemed a success.<eos> And the conveniently-timed sniper hit was just written off.<eos> Clearly someone on the inside leaked the details of the op.<eos> Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared.<eos> The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to Morrow?<eos> I did.
Happy unburdening.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hello, Mr. Pickens.<eos> Ms. Person.<eos> Well, here we all are.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Here we all are.<eos> Are you ready to do this?<eos> No, ma'am, but, uh, I always figured this day was coming.<eos> Maybe I did, too.
And George?<eos> Did you question him any further about his possible sexual involvement with Hanna?<eos> I mean, given Daniel's assertion that it was the other boys and not Daniel himself who had sex with her that night.<eos> I fully intended to, Ms. Person.<eos> But?<eos> Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.
It's not fair for you to have to sit on this.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> If somebody else finds out, though, you know?<eos> I just gotta go on and do it.<eos> Get it over with.<eos> He's in the backyard, mulching.<eos> Do you mind being back there with us?<eos> I think it might help.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I do.
God...<eos> Safe travels, sir.<eos> And hug my brother for me, will you?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> See you around sometime.<eos> See you around.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got you.<eos> You did.
Tell Jared I said hi.<eos> I will.<eos> That's tough, Dan.<eos> That really is.<eos> Women... they're what makes this world go around.<eos> They can sure make the world feel like it's got some kind of direction, yes.<eos> Sounds like you cared a lot about this lady, Dan.<eos> I did, Tyrus.<eos> I still do.<eos> 'Course you do, Dan.
And that's what I'm going with today, Mr. Stern.<eos> No promises beyond that.<eos> Words to live by, Mr. Holden, for today.<eos> Double Dee?<eos> Don't play hard to get now.<eos> For real, Dee, you gonna do me that way?<eos> What?<eos> You ever dream of being somewhere else?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Cardigan or no cardigan?<eos> - Cardigan?<eos> - That's a good choice.<eos> Jake Fitzgerald!<eos> It's Sheriff Acosta.<eos> I need to speak with you.<eos> - Oh, I'm good.<eos> - Why?<eos> You didn't like the last one?<eos> No, I did, too much.
It's $1,200.<eos> Is there a store in the mall that sells $1,200 for, like, $50?<eos> How is this thing so expensive?<eos> Aly!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Seriously? We just had this conversation outside the mall.<eos> - Aly! What are you doing here?<eos> You don't... remember that?<eos> No, no, I do, I do.<eos> - You don't, do you?
Hi.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, did you want to order?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And you have a consult, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> I left the room for just a few minutes.<eos> Were the boys out front?<eos> Did they find the person who did it?<eos> No.<eos> The boys found your gun.<eos> They were playing with it.<eos> Your gun?<eos> You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.
Your gun?<eos> You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But it's locked.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We were just playing. It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
I just mean you're in the Army.<eos> I imagine...<eos> Well, you need one in the Army.<eos> You don't need one here.<eos> Well, every day, someone's kid is in an O.R. with a gunshot wound.<eos> Every single day.<eos> When are people gonna learn?<eos> It just makes things worse.<eos> And people always say they need one for protection.<eos> - They don't.
Well, every day, someone's kid is in an O.R. with a gunshot wound.<eos> Every single day.<eos> When are people gonna learn?<eos> It just makes things worse.<eos> And people always say they need one for protection.<eos> - They don't.<eos> - Unless they do.<eos> I have a gun.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I do.
They're family.<eos> Family messes you up.<eos> That part's new for me.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Ben.<eos> What are you...<eos> I just came by to, uh...<eos> You know, I-I had a nice conversation<eos> - with Don Heller just now.<eos> - You did?
The gun was locked up.<eos> It was supposed to be locked in a drawer.<eos> It was.<eos> - I don't know how they...<eos> - Kids watch.<eos> You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> In my dreams I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
- I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.<eos> - They love you, too.<eos> - No, I love them like...<eos> If something happened to them, I would die.<eos> Like, my heart is so wide open, and they're so fragile.<eos> I don't know how you live like this.<eos> I don't.
"Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.<eos> And that was the last thing I ever said to her.<eos> You didn't mean to.<eos> Hey.<eos> Got a late one, huh?<eos> I do.
Let me have a look there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Getting fluid in her abdomen. This pregnancy has just become non-viable.<eos> This baby's barely viable outside that womb.<eos> It's only 24 weeks.<eos> - You can repair it, can't you?<eos> - I can try. Throw in a plasma patch, hope for the best.<eos> - "Hope for the best?"<eos> - It's experimental, but if we want to prolong this pregnancy...<eos> - Of course we do.
- Professionally.<eos> - We have. Yes.<eos> Are you a trivia buff?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, you and Dr. Robbins have enjoyed trivia nights together.<eos> That's correct, yes.<eos> You go and play, drink, and flirt with women... is that correct?<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - I'm married and I don't drink.<eos> So Dr. Robbins did all the drinking and flirting.
We're all on the same page, Grey.<eos> You're not more interested in saving a life than the rest of us.<eos> Antibiotic irrigation.<eos> What'd you have?<eos> Young kid with advanced nec fasc. I just hope I got it all.<eos> I hear you. I've got a ventricular washout on a massive brain abscess.<eos> Sounds last-ditch. Sorry.<eos> Well, not necessarily. I... feel pretty good about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do.
Stephanie, stop.<eos> We tried everything we could.<eos> His brain had already infarcted from herniation.<eos> It was too far gone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Amelia, stuff your feelings in!<eos> What?<eos> It's not my love day. I have things to do.<eos> Where is she? - Oh, thank God.<eos> Amelia, open the door.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> If they don't want to be here, then... they shouldn't be.<eos> We don't want them.<eos> They don't get it, and they don't have to.<eos> I do.
Dad was... well, Dad, and Mum...<eos> Well, Mum was rather lovely in the beginning.<eos> But things change, don't they?<eos> Dad started going into the garage and tinkering with a little project he called humanity.<eos> Mum grew cold... distant.<eos> And pretty soon, they were both neglecting their family.<eos> And then one of his children started to act out?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Yeah... so Dad got pissed off and tossed me out of the house.<eos> And what did your mother do?
- She used to score big from some other guy before she got clean.<eos> But then Gillian cut him off completely, and the guy, he was super pissed.<eos> Right, and where can I find this other dealer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Oh... - No, I-I-I swear<eos> I've never met him.<eos> Look, he goes by the name of... of Bobby B.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I thought you said this case doesn't have anything to do with your mom anymore.<eos> It doesn't.
It's not pretty.<eos> All right. Here we go.<eos> You got to stop beating yourself up over this.<eos> What you did to Andrew?<eos> After everything he did to you? The only thing you should feel bad about is that you didn't do it sooner.<eos> He's right.<eos> And it appears you're in the clear.<eos> No one's investigating Andrew's death.<eos> Jake and the president took care of that.<eos> How you doing?
So if I had to endorse somebody right now, it would have to be Senator Grant.<eos> I'm confused. You want me to pass that message on to Susan?<eos> 'Cause I really don't want to give her that kind of news.<eos> Tamarac Sugar. I believe you're familiar with them?<eos> They're currently under investigation by my office, so, yes.<eos> I'd like you to drop your investigation.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because there's still time before the primary, which means there's still time for me to change my mind and endorse someone other than Senator Grant. Say, Susan, for instance.<eos> Do you realize what you're suggesting, Governor?<eos> Because maybe you don't.
Okay.<eos> We're here.<eos> - I'm just saying that you seem to think you know better than me at all times, sir.<eos> You clearly think your judgement supercedes mine, so why should I use my brain for ridiculous things like thinking when you're gonna do it for me anyway.<eos> I put a plane in the air.<eos> You did my job for me.<eos> You overruled me. You called my play.<eos> You were making mistakes. You were off the rails.<eos> When that happens, I have the right to make...<eos> No, no. You do not.
Anything else you want to tell us about what happened, Emma?<eos> No, Sheriff, that's it.<eos> Okay. You're free to go.<eos> Hey! You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I... I told him about the phone.<eos> Uh, yeah, I guess you thought that was the best way to handle it?<eos> Someone's messing with us, and our choices matter, and I would like to think that you trust me enough to make my own.<eos> Of course I do.
Hold on just one second.<eos> I just want to get this over with, okay?<eos> He's gonna be in his old classroom.<eos> Listen, we don't know what you're walking into right now.<eos> We have no idea.<eos> True?<eos> I'm about to "convince" sleazy Branson to keep his mouth shut.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> You came to me because you said that I'm dark and I understand this stuff.<eos> Well, I do!
Awesome. Okay.<eos> On my three.<eos> Ready?<eos> One... two... three.<eos> Raid!<eos> [Indistinct conversations] Cricket: Whatever you're doing's not working.<eos> Alex didn't even show up.<eos> Brought you something, Cricket.<eos> Blotter, I don't want any herbal whatevers.<eos> I do.
You dosed me.<eos> You were the only one who knew about the acid.<eos> All right, look. I understand you're upset.<eos> Yo, Newbie.<eos> You think he actually cares about?<eos> He'll do anything to get what he wants.<eos> But, hey. You... You got the girl.<eos> Congrats, bro.<eos> ♪ Can die without a dream ♪ You don't actually believe him, do you?<eos> Actually, I do.
Let him off with a warning?<eos> No.<eos> He should not be killed, he should be made to testify.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, Watson and I have got some...<eos> Against whom? What?<eos> You said he should be made to testify.<eos> Against whom?<eos> Against whoever hired him, obviously.<eos> You already know who it is.<eos> I do not.
A ghost.<eos> She's safe as long as you don't interfere!<eos> I've seen some bizarre things on my journey, but this... takes the cakes and all the candles.<eos> Why are they here?<eos> Why not sleep at home?<eos> They can't.<eos> According to the kid and his mom, those bugs have been making that noise for two weeks.<eos> That must be torture.<eos> If it has been going on that long, why haven't they left?<eos> Some did.
Fuck, Dan!<eos> I mean, fuck!<eos> Doc Chance.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Is Carl around?<eos> At home.<eos> A little under the weather.<eos> I guess maybe you're the guy I need to talk to anyway, to begin.<eos> Uh, do you remember that furniture we looked at about a month or so ago, that French Art Deco stuff?<eos> I do.
We stick to the plan.<eos> In four hours, they'll bring Jeremy out.<eos> We hide in the woods, and we rescue him.<eos> You're my Alpha.<eos> What you ask, I do.<eos> And weapons?<eos> Just knives.<eos> I'm good with that.<eos> You jumped to Sasha's defence pretty quickly after he ran away.<eos> Unless he didn't.
- Speak when spoken to.<eos> Where are your scrips?<eos> No need to rush, Brother.<eos> Let's eat first.<eos> - We shouldn't linger.<eos> - We haven't eaten in two days.<eos> This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.<eos> He's got apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
Those guys hurt my back.<eos> There's a bag up there.<eos> Can you reach it?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.<eos> I couldn't really blame them, though.<eos> Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
Then... what?<eos> Give me five minutes alone with Renton.<eos> Leave you two alone together?<eos> Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.<eos> Just go to the kitchen and eat.<eos> That's believable.<eos> We're not here to eat.<eos> He has apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
You all right?<eos> - Just déjà vu.<eos> All right, change of plans?<eos> This is it.<eos> What about the target?<eos> Is he here?<eos> We gotta disable that before we take him down.<eos> Why?<eos> How well do you know that Cuz guy?<eos> I don't.
Not just Agnes.<eos> Oh, you made it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Just like her mother.<eos> Are we okay?<eos> Liz, it's over.<eos> There's nobody coming after us.<eos> It's just you and me. And her.<eos> We did it.
You got at least three good seasons left in you.<eos> What you think, Spence?<eos> Well, I think you already got four 100-catch seasons.<eos> No one's ever had seven.<eos> That could be you.<eos> You win a championship, you got a right to be in that Canton conversation.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Don't say you ain't dreamt of having that beautiful beard in bronze.<eos> Yeah, but I don't wanna get ahead of myself.<eos> Shit, well, you do it with everything else.
Well, your grandmother loves you, and she's concerned about you, and we can understand...<eos> And we will respectfully disagree with her.<eos> A lot of good will come of this.<eos> Dontrell Tariq will go to prison because of this.<eos> Yeah, well, it won't bring my cousin back.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> But it will bring justice to his memory, and likely prevent another innocent life from being taken by this sociopath.<eos> He killed your cousin right in front of you.<eos> Why do you want to do him the favor of shutting up about it?<eos> I don't.
You and I both know you cannot open that bag without my consent or a search warrant.<eos> Warrant?<eos> Thought we're on the same side here, Joe.<eos> We are.<eos> But please put the bag down.<eos> You remember, Joe, when you told me that you'd do anything possible to find the animal who did this?<eos> Yeah. Well, so would I.<eos> He did it, Erin.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
No, does it mean out of hand?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Well, then I don't want to know about it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because if I know about it, I got to do something about it.<eos> Think, Garrett.<eos> I'm on to you, you know.<eos> There's no way you were ever gonna cancel that party.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
We're just worried that, untreated, this condition can result in serious injury, even death.<eos> It'll only take 15 minutes.<eos> What if I say no?<eos> Then I will have to impel your cooperation.<eos> You're doing this for Laurel, aren't you?<eos> No, I'm doing it for the safety of the populace.<eos> Please, come with me.<eos> I'm gonna get my phone and my jacket, okay?<eos> I'm gonna record every step of this.<eos> Please do, ma'am.
You think, uh, we're covering something up?<eos> Maybe it's just due to negligence on the part of your security team, Jacob.<eos> Malachi, please keep reviewing the video, every single thing from the last 48 hours.<eos> [Walt] Vincent Parr had his wallet.<eos> None of his winnings were in it.<eos> Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
You cut your hair?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well, it looks good.<eos> Remember that one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Scotch?<eos> Uh, no, thank you.<eos> Well, I'm going to have one.<eos> I thought you quit drinking.<eos> I did.
Or at least I used to be.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> How did I get here?<eos> JC, I used your shower and now I'm all sticky.<eos> It's coconut water.<eos> Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
How... how?<eos> Oh good, they brought rope.<eos> I hope they brought some for me too.<eos> And they did not bring deodorant.<eos> Ladies, what is this and how can we make it stop?<eos> You got a front row seat to New York City's elite underground ladies' arm wrestling.<eos> One, two, three, wrestle!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I own an arm wrestling bar.<eos> No, you don't.
My freedom is at hand.<eos> You will feel my wrath.<eos> The wrath of Savitar!<eos> Did it work?<eos> That was so scary.<eos> was it not truly frightening, what the voice and the prophesies and the... it was... I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
When I learned the truth about what my sister had done for me,<eos> I did the only thing a decent person could do.<eos> I threw myself off the cliffs.<eos> As I lay dying, I prayed.<eos> For mercy.<eos> For love.<eos> For forgiveness.<eos> Oh... help... somebody help...<eos> But God never answered me.<eos> Instead, he did.
"I guess I gambled and cheated on account of my dishonesty."<eos> I was a kid.<eos> Well, unless your last name is Pan, you haven't been a kid for a long time.<eos> So, explain to me the last 20-plus years.<eos> None of your business, Damon.<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> This has gone way too far.<eos> You do not need to answer him.<eos> Yes you do.
I know, right?<eos> You want to hop on?<eos> Okay, if we're gonna live together, we need to have some house rules.<eos> Rule number one, and I can't believe I'm saying this, no sex swing.<eos> You said I could bring my furniture.<eos> A sex swing is not furniture.<eos> We have to agree on what's gonna be in the common area, Maze.<eos> Fine, I don't agree with your cheesy decorations.<eos> You don't like Halloween?<eos> Of course I do.
What murder are we solving today?<eos> I mean, everyone here looks dead.<eos> We've have an injured groom and a deceased bride.<eos> Oh, they got to that "till death do us part" nonsense quickly, didn't they?<eos> The bride suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.<eos> Chest?<eos> Shooter didn't go for the head?<eos> First rule of zombie killing.<eos> Do you want to work this case with me or not?<eos> Of course I do.
I can't keep track of all these elaborate metaphors.<eos> But it's not a metaphor, Doctor.<eos> You need to take me seriously.<eos> You need to believe what I'm saying.<eos> Otherwise, you'll never understand...<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
Someone... better, more helpful.<eos> - More boring.<eos> - Okay... got you a hot, soy latte, extra foam.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You okay, Chloe?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> All good. Just on my way out.<eos> Something's seriously bothering her.<eos> Oh, I hadn't noticed.<eos> But you did.
Deal with it, Mother!<eos> Sunshine.<eos> Beautiful people.<eos> Expensive cars.<eos> The glamorous life.<eos> Get ready to see the real Los Angeles on this thrill ride tour.<eos> Well, it appears I've been misled.<eos> Whoever put together this brochure should get special treatment in Hell.<eos> I don't need you to show me around the city.<eos> Well, of course you do.
I got to rush back.<eos> Where's Lucifer?<eos> Something came up at his club.<eos> I don't think he's coming back.<eos> Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.<eos> He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
You have any idea where she could be hiding?<eos> Hiding?<eos> What for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well... if she does show up, let her know I'd like to speak with her about pressing charges.<eos> She won't be pressing charges.<eos> But we have their faces.<eos> Yeah, she wants to move past this.<eos> Did she tell you that, David?<eos> Yeah, she did.
You don't get it. I don't...<eos> I don't want to be that guy.<eos> And my dad... he doesn't want me to be that guy. And Rose...<eos> No one wants me to be that guy. What if you are?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I know that you're just some... some spoiled-ass rich kid.<eos> But you know everything 'cause your mom's a junkie?<eos> Okay, you didn't have to say that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Neither did you.
Yeah. It's not an important job, but it's an... honest job.<eos> It doesn't matter to you that you could do important things here.<eos> Why not take advantage of your father's position?<eos> Of his power?<eos> Or did you come all this way just to tell him how hurt you were?<eos> The only reason that I came to Berlin is because he ordered me to.<eos> I know you don't want to hear this, but your father is trying to do right by the Reich and now by you if you would give him a chance.<eos> He doesn't deserve another chance.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But maybe you do.
- Angel, stop. Stop. Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Sita... just listen.<eos> You got to help me help you, okay? - Think.<eos> Think!<eos> - I don't know. I tried.<eos> He must've said something.<eos> I don't know. I've tried everything, okay?<eos> I don't know where he put it, I don't...<eos> I don't...
Why me?<eos> I've never shot anyone before.<eos> Yeah, I know, but I figured out a way we can ink you back into the club if you do.<eos> And about the deal?<eos> I have that taken care of, but I need you to step up and do this, Sita.<eos> Morning, Helen.<eos> Hi.<eos> Maybe it's time you and I sit down, talk about this killer you're looking for.<eos> - I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - We did.
Let's go, Dad.<eos> So, Ryan's got me in the penalty box for back channeling with you.<eos> It's better than jail.<eos> What could you have possibly done that pissed Sita off that bad?<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> I think I'm gonna take out my 401(k) and help her get a new start.<eos> Really, after she got you arrested?<eos> Yeah, I'm guessing you don't have a sister.<eos> I got Gabe and this case I want off my desk.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure you do.
What?<eos> Lie, like you did.<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think... because I wanted to get close to people.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You don't need to do that with me... or with Helen.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> No.<eos> I don't... no.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her much of anything.<eos> I mean, I talked, but I didn't really say anything.<eos> What did she do to deserve to hear about my nightmares, right?<eos> And then I just wanted to be with her and for her to remain exactly how she was in that first moment that I saw her... innocent, beautiful, and young.<eos> How did it end?<eos> Badly.<eos> After Buffalo, I couldn't go on anymore.<eos> I just wanted to end it all.<eos> - Who hasn't?<eos> - No, I really did.
Call you later.<eos> Go on, get this boy out of here.<eos> - Easy, Bo.<eos> - Now.<eos> He has every right to be here.<eos> They're friends.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that ever since Philip showed up...<eos> You're going to go there?<eos> - Tell me I don't have a point.<eos> - You don't.
- Mm-mmm.<eos> - But maybe it was déjà vu, 'cause you were running down this road with my bike, and then we went to this crazy party in Red Hook, and I kissed you in front of everyone.<eos> Oh, all that happened in your déjà vu?<eos> Yeah, it did.<eos> No, Lukas, déjà vu is about something that already happened, not about the future.<eos> - Oh, my God, you're an idiot. - Mmm.<eos> - Mm-mmm. - Yes.<eos> You just completely made that up, right?<eos> Maybe, but it got you laughing.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Green for bonded, blue for unbonded.<eos> Yes, but how did you get your eyes like that?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Are your primary users out?<eos> Mr Barber resides here, but is in Barbados on holiday with Marissa.<eos> Marissa's your sister?<eos> Marissa's Mr Barber's lover.<eos> She is 27 years old.<eos> She occasionally stays here when Mr Barber does.<eos> When he does?
With 32% saying they'd view it "extremely unfavorably."<eos> And how would they view President Dalton for making such a trade?<eos> Ah, that came in at 78%:<eos> "What are you, nuts?"<eos> Figured as much.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> Wha...?<eos> I have no idea what's going on.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Who does?
- How many?<eos> - 400.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> And, Matt, you're not gonna be a disappointment.<eos> You're gonna crush it.<eos> Elise.<eos> Russell...<eos> Now that I'm on the other side of this, it is pretty rude.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Sailor.<eos> Sailor.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> I have to be judicious with the antimalarial treatment because of her pregnancy. - Did you test her blood?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down,<eos> I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
I keep an extra one in my car, just in case I get interviewed on television.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Put on the bird shirt, Sam.<eos> I will.<eos> When?<eos> When I don't have to take my other shirt off in a bar full of people.<eos> - Ten years? !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You didn't tell him for ten years?<eos> I did.
Here.<eos> I can't throw it away, but I can't give it to him.<eos> Don't worry, Jess, you... you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I'm not the one for Sam.<eos> You are.<eos> I'm gonna be really honest.<eos> Um, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.<eos> That was the most romantic story I've ever heard.<eos> And I don't want to get between them.<eos> Or do I?
Wow. Broke as fuck, my nigga.<eos> Yes.<eos> Please, y'all. Come on.<eos> Did you check your shoes?<eos> Why the fuck would the key be in my shoes?<eos> Stop being scary, nigga. Figure it out.<eos> You know what, Marcus?<eos> I'ma let you go.<eos> You know my son, man.<eos> - Please don't, man.
Shit.<eos> Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.<eos> Did you check your jacket?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I just think we need a chance as humans to... fail in order to discover what actually works, you know?<eos> People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
Hmm. How'd it feel?<eos> Empowering?<eos> I just have something I need to tell you before you go.<eos> How do you know I'm going?<eos> Because I'm Abby Sciuto, and I know things.<eos> Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
I don't know why I'm crying in here.<eos> Jess' room is meant for sex.<eos> So, Just-just hit lobby and let technology do its thing.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> When-when I get in there, I'll just hit lobby.<eos> Cool.<eos> Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess. You know.<eos> No, I don't.

One hundred percent.<eos> No matter what I do.<eos> Mrs. Bligh, too.<eos> Sometimes the bad ones leave us no choice.<eos> Ooh-ooh! - Quick. Hide.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Mrs. Collins!<eos> The joys of breakfast al fresco.<eos> That's Italian, you know.<eos> Oh. Well, of course you do.
We'll see.<eos> All right. One more day.<eos> Anna.<eos> Which at least gives us some time.<eos> It gives me time to deal with my antiquated attitudes.<eos> Anna, for heaven's sake, stop!<eos> Yes?<eos> I love your idea of bringing Gino around.<eos> But please, James should remember in his own time.<eos> And if he doesn't?
- I'll keep you informed.<eos> She will be lashing out.<eos> They frequently do.<eos> (ENGINE STARTS) - You all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll pour us a jar.<eos> - It's over.<eos> - For now.<eos> - If anything had happened...<eos> - It didn't.
Perhaps give her time.<eos> She's with Olivia today.<eos> Jack's seeing Gino.<eos> Well, let me know if there's anything I can do.<eos> I will.<eos> I bear a portion of the blame.<eos> For Anna. Rose is simply the tip of the iceberg.<eos> She's what brought it to a head.<eos> Do you see no hope?<eos> Anna doesn't, more to the point.
We're not surrendering for a garden and some oranges.<eos> The Commander asks you to read these.<eos> They're newspapers from Manila.<eos> The Commander wants peace.<eos> Aren't his men enough? Now he sends in his whores?<eos> You're a good man, Lieutenant.<eos> I told my people what you did for me.<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - You saved my life.<eos> Do the same for your soldiers.
Looking for love in the wrong place.<eos> We're doing our job.<eos> Yeah, well, Russell and Hayes were doing just that, their jobs, and now they're looking at losing those jobs.<eos> Santana has to pay for shooting a cop.<eos> All hands should be on that deck.<eos> Okay, but that's not the way it works, and you all know that.<eos> Search of his apartment came up empty.<eos> The guy's good at covering his tracks.<eos> That's because a snake never leaves tracks.<eos> Actually, they do. What?

What?<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> Well, don't.
- And thank you very much...<eos> - No! I'm not done.<eos> And you know what I saw? Nothing!<eos> No white light.<eos> Just big, black, empty nothing.<eos> And that's where Jake is right now!<eos> Instead of up here, with me, where he belonged.<eos> Unless we wake up and stop acting like this isn't Murderville, we're all gonna end up like Jake.<eos> And we'll deserve it.<eos> But he didn't.
- Are you gonna get that?<eos> - No, no. I am... I'm in this right now.<eos> - You should probably get that.<eos> - I'm just not even gonna look at it.<eos> Is it Audrey?<eos> I mean, yeah, but she's just... she's been going through a lot tonight, so...<eos> Okay, you know, maybe we should just wait.<eos> - A lot has been going on...<eos> - Zoe, we don't have to worry about anybody else, right?<eos> But we do and you do.
But... I never knew how to talk about it.<eos> But then I came to camp, and I met someone.<eos> I didn't have to tell her I was gay.<eos> She just understood that I was different.<eos> And her response was to give me that tape.<eos> Bowie lives how he wants to live.<eos> He does what he wants, and he doesn't care what people think.<eos> Listening to Bowie gave me the courage to come out.<eos> And everyone just accepted you?<eos> Of course not. But Cricket did.
Um, I got to...<eos> Hey, we're approaching the rendezvous location Devon's black market contacts gave us.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> He is flying the "Marauder" over to the ship with the drug dealers on it to make the trade.<eos> And you're going with him as backup.<eos> I can fly the "Marauder". Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
We're not pregaming a takedown.<eos> All right, Mom, I'm just trying to have a little fun.<eos> Oh, you think what we're doing is fun?<eos> No.<eos> But yes.<eos> So I don't know Max personally, but apparently he attacked this girl that he met on Mate.<eos> Way to ruin a good thing, Max.<eos> Why the ghost treatment?<eos> I thought you liked Tyler.<eos> I do.
So what should we do about Jessie?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> _<eos> Got your text.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
EMTs are on the way.<eos> Well, how long?<eos> They're just busy with other calls at the moment.<eos> 45 minutes or so.<eos> Oh, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> What?<eos> What did she say?<eos> No, don't worry. We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> No, no, what did she...?
Your office is coordinating gerrymandering with the Maryland State House.<eos> One of our constituents complained.<eos> Okay...<eos> Let's back up.<eos> I think we should talk about last night.<eos> I've had good nights, I've had bad nights, but I've never had...<eos> Yes, it was odd.<eos> I don't know what it was.<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - What did I...
Okay.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Why can't we do that?<eos> Because you were yelling at me to go faster while you ate chocolate and salami.<eos> I just need some time to think.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Oh, um... what did you need when you came by the office?<eos> I need your list of gerrymander districts.<eos> We have a bug.<eos> You do?
Uh, a constituent gave it to me.<eos> I thought it was funny.<eos> But then, uh, then I realized who put it out.<eos> It's our very own Centers for Disease Control.<eos> The real one; the one we're discussing right now.<eos> They put out a comic book about how to repel a zombie attack.<eos> This was merely a way to get people who usually don't care about disease to read about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I thought I had five minutes.<eos> You do.
Would you do me the honor of getting my item for me?"<eos> So she went and got them, and after that, I paid for the hose.<eos> Just so you know.<eos> Oh, I need to use the loo.<eos> You know, you're are really nice fimily. Thank you.<eos> They love you, and I am sorry about my mom.<eos> No, no, no. Don't be sorry about your mom. Never be sorry about your mom.<eos> I'm very sorry about my shitty mother.<eos> Okay, well, I don't know her.<eos> No, you don't.
Funny hobby.<eos> Next, we have a little Syrah from McLaren Vale.<eos> Some beautiful black fruits mixed with black pepper and some baking spices.<eos> Absolutely stunning with the very happy duck coming next.<eos> - Thank you, Dan.<eos> - Thanks, Dan.<eos> What are black fruits?<eos> Black fruits are like, you know, blackberries or blackcurrants, just dark berries.<eos> And how do they get them into the wine?<eos> No, they don't...
Good.<eos> You know, when you said that you were living in a caravan, you know...<eos> I kind of thought you were joking.<eos> Well, it's both true and a joke, isn't it?<eos> It's like... this is a joke.<eos> My life is a joke. - No, it's not.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Methinks you might want to make your exit now.<eos> No, I don't want to leave, actually, as it happens.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It's not personal.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that you were coming back to Med?<eos> I didn't know until this morning.<eos> So you'll be back in the E.D.?<eos> Uh, not exactly.<eos> Dr. Charles wants me to be a psych resident.<eos> You?<eos> Is that such a shock?<eos> I just didn't realize that you had an interest in that.<eos> I didn't.
Ah, because I should flag up that I do have a basket weaving class starting imminently.<eos> Yeah, it should be here any sec.<eos> Er... have you been in any other natural disasters?<eos> Erm...<eos> let me think... not a disaster as such, but we were snowed in when I was a child and...<eos> We couldn't open the door because of all the snow. - Wow.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - It melted, presumably.<eos> Er... stay out of this, please.<eos> Did it? It did, yes.
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
It's a segment we are calling Conversation Street.<eos> - Well...<eos> - What?<eos> We put a lot of work into that!<eos> It was really, really hard doing that.<eos> Better than that, rather brilliantly, we have made a bespoke version of that sting for every single episode we're gonna make for the next three years.<eos> How about that?<eos> But hold on.<eos> The slight problem with that is that we were so busy doing that we didn't think actually of anything to talk about.<eos> - We did.
The slight problem with that is that we were so busy doing that we didn't think actually of anything to talk about.<eos> - We did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - You'll love this.<eos> James May, the world's slowest moving human being, has been caught speeding.<eos> Actually charged by the police.<eos> Criminal.<eos> He's actually quite proud of it.<eos> He did it on a Honda CBR 600RR sports bike.
I'm with CatCo magazine.<eos> Sort of.<eos> It's a publication not known for its hard-hitting journalism.<eos> More like "High-waisted Jeans, Yes or No?"<eos> - I'm just tagging along today.<eos> - Right.<eos> Can we just speed this interview along?<eos> Just ask me what you want to ask, Mr. Kent.<eos> Did I have anything to do with the Venture explosion?<eos> Did you?
This is a great honor.<eos> Inside.<eos> This space station is in danger.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Who else is here with you?<eos> Boone, Lin?<eos> We're not the problem. It's Ferrous Corp.<eos> They brought a bomb on board.<eos> Now, I don't know how they got it past your scans, but you have to believe me.<eos> No. I don't.
Shutting down won't make a difference.<eos> You have to leave now.<eos> What about all the other people on this station?<eos> There's nothing I can do for them.<eos> That upgrade didn't just change the way you talk.<eos> It changed the way you think and feel.<eos> You tried to help me before you knew I could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Blair.<eos> What's Cricket's favorite song?<eos> Why?<eos> What do you care why?<eos> Is this that thing that straight guys do when girls reject them?<eos> Come on, favorite song... easy answer.<eos> Blotter already made her a mix tape.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I was hoping maybe he'd forgotten a track.<eos> He did, actually.
Alex said you might be able to help get my family out of the country.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What's it gonna take?<eos> For the hero of Russia?<eos> 100,000 even.<eos> That's the hero rate?<eos> I've had expenses.<eos> I think Swagger just sent me a message.<eos> You think?<eos> Either he did or he didn't.
Animals are drawn to me.<eos> I'm a target.<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll keep bringing heat to the team.<eos> No.<eos> We can handle it.<eos> What about what you said? About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
We can handle it.<eos> What about what you said? About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> You can't answer that quickly.<eos> Before, I was wrong.<eos> But now I have something to fight for.<eos> Unless you don't want to.<eos> I do.
I'll see if there are any other drug candidates that may help mitigate the symptoms.<eos> How are they doing in there?<eos> They're working as fast as they can.<eos> How are you?<eos> I feel like, uh... there's a dam inside me about to crack wide open... and there's nothing I can do to stop it.<eos> Mitch, your father, and the Shepherds... they're working on a solution.<eos> I don't know, Abe.<eos> Even if they do figure it out, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.<eos> It will work.<eos> Yeah, well, what if it doesn't?
I know how to get out.<eos> How?<eos> Make a distraction.<eos> Uh... ahem. Excuse me, can I get a glass of water, please, sir?<eos> Swallow your spit, boy.<eos> I'm not a boy, actually.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have eyes, right? You can tell I'm not a child, and I am definitely not your son, so don't call me "boy."<eos> I'm not sure you realize where you are, boy.<eos> Actually, I do.
Got a sec, boss?<eos> Yeah. What's up?<eos> Yeah...<eos> - We love your show.<eos> Do you want to dance? Uh-uh.<eos> No. But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- That's ridiculous.<eos> I'd like to say I remember that day, but... I barely do.<eos> I'm clean now, finally, but... I was on the streets then.<eos> I remember her dying, your mom, remember the baby.<eos> I'd like to say I remember leaving you at a fire station, but I don't. Not an excuse.<eos> In fact, it probably tells you something about me that I don't remember.<eos> I do like fire stations, though, so that sounds like something I'd do if I had to do something, you know?<eos> Anyway, I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but either way, you can be sure this life of mine is punishment enough for the things I've done.<eos> - If you think I'm gonna forgive you...<eos> - I don't.
William.<eos> This is William.<eos> William Hill.<eos> I'm Beth. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm Beth.<eos> - It's a pleasure meeting you, Beth. - Mm.<eos> You have a hole in your pants.<eos> Annie!<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> I actually do.
Okay. You can come inside for a water. - All right.<eos> - A water. Uh-huh.<eos> We have already had our six ounces of wine. I know.<eos> 150 calories per six ounce.<eos> You keep counting calories, and you're gonna really turn me on. - Yeah.<eos> You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal? No.<eos> Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.

Because we're undercover.<eos> Because it's a secret.<eos> Raimy... I know what kind of father I've been, okay?<eos> And I know what I've lost.<eos> I lost your mother... and I lost you.<eos> I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
If you're going, I'll go.<eos> Dr. Shepherd. I-I just want to say thank you for letting me work on your service.<eos> I know that you...<eos> Stop thanking me.<eos> We got work to do.<eos> Wilma is waiting.<eos> Wilma?<eos> Nasty, annoying Wilma.<eos> It says here Patricia.<eos> Hello. So, how we doing?
After I stopped screaming from the pain, we fucked like rabbits.<eos> And from that night on, I knew I would give up everything for that woman.<eos> My God, we had fun.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I sound like I'm still stuck on her.<eos> She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
Especially given the circumstances.<eos> How many of them have you infected?<eos> With bugs?<eos> That's the wonderful thing.<eos> It's just me.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> No, that's the great thing about this country. Everybody here is just doing their job.<eos> I don't have to do anything.<eos> What if I tell them?<eos> Yes. Do.
- Oh, God.<eos> No, you dense flower.<eos> Answer by saying nothing.<eos> Type nothing.<eos> No, I see now how that sounds confusing.<eos> Just give me the phone.<eos> _<eos> Is that "Infinite Jest?"<eos> There's no way he's read that whole book.<eos> - Yes, he did.

Just unlock it.<eos> I can't believe you're a vigilante.<eos> It's stuck on this side.<eos> Don't do anything stupid today.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Do you?
You have a machete!<eos> Why didn't you just say "I'm not Dirk Gently?"<eos> Because I don't know who that is!<eos> Hi!<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I live here.<eos> Right, but where are you going?<eos> Didn't you say you lost your job? No, I didn't say that, actually.<eos> - How did you...
It was a steal.<eos> You're hungry for cars?<eos> I went hungry as a kid.<eos> I have a surprise for you too.<eos> Step up.<eos> - Ready?<eos> You're crazy!<eos> - I'm crazy about you.<eos> She's yours.<eos> - Mine? What do I do with her?
Well, he didn't say anything to me...<eos> Stavo doesn't talk about it.<eos> He draws it.<eos> But, if you really want to know who has the largest obsession with Piper...<eos> I would have to say it's Emma Duval.<eos> She was already dealing with hallucinations, fits of rage, violent, recurring nightmares.<eos> There's no telling how this new round of violence could be impacting her.<eos> _<eos> Coming home doesn't mean you have to forgive him.<eos> I never do... really.
Emma and Audrey are on their way to the James farm.<eos> The pig farm?<eos> Did Kieran say why?<eos> No, and Emma won't answer my calls.<eos> Stevens, let's move.<eos> Fabulous.<eos> It's a crumbling, creepy house.<eos> Yeah, there's also a crumbling, creepy barn to match.<eos> It used to belong to the James family.<eos> Or it still does.
Make it stop.<eos> Why isn't it working? Push another milligram.<eos> Since when do you smoke?<eos> Nervous habit.<eos> Trying not to start again.<eos> T.C.'s not answering any of my messages.<eos> I-I'm worried.<eos> Is that all this is about?<eos> Not our moving-in conversation? I feel like I opened my big mouth, and I scared you off.<eos> No, you didn't.
You little bastard. That thing is huge.<eos> 7-0 chromic.<eos> Removing cross clamps.<eos> His heart's beating again.<eos> Good job. Send a blood gas.<eos> We're gonna get closed up here.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?<eos> Just between us?<eos> Yeah. You know about the missing Norco?<eos> I do.
But I know that she didn't take it, and it's really pissing me off that nobody believes her.<eos> Scott, come on.<eos> You can't blame people for being suspicious.<eos> - She's an addict.<eos> - Yeah, I know she's an addict.<eos> I'm an addict, too, but you trust me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I trust you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you are not her.<eos> She didn't do it.
- Yes. I'm afraid the whole topic is still not taken seriously.<eos> Oui?<eos> C'est bon.<eos> You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake.<eos> Professor.<eos> It's curious, though.<eos> In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.<eos> She gave him a blowjob.<eos> He didn't force her to.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Solloway?<eos> Sorry it took me a while to get here.<eos> They never let us know who's coming through.<eos> I hope that Warden Hagan wasn't too much of a hard-ass.<eos> He can really lay down the law, but, he's actually a good guy, once you get to know him.<eos> He was fine. Thanks.<eos> - Good.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> You... you look... you look familiar.<eos> - I... - No, I don't.
I thought Luisa was dropping her off today.<eos> She got stuck at work.<eos> We're short a hostess, so...<eos> Well, it's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you too.<eos> Okay, do you want to go to the playground today? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, Joanie.<eos> Mama, does she have to come?<eos> Yes, baby, she does.
You did it!<eos> My brave girl. Hey.<eos> My brave girl.<eos> All right, so, what shall we do now?<eos> - Swings.<eos> - Swings.<eos> God, you're so big now.<eos> Look at you..<eos> Do you remember when I was born?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
I don't want to ride the pony.<eos> I want more cake.<eos> Okay, you can have another piece of cake after you ride the pony.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Look, I can take her for cake.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I can. Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
You can have the restaurant, Cole, the house, but please, please, don't take her away from me.<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here? Do you really think that I would stab Noah Solloway?<eos> No!<eos> What?<eos> I... no, of course not.<eos> Then why did you send the police to me?<eos> - I didn't.
We need to find out who this pervert is.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Danny, you're not packing "The Jackhammer," unless you mean business.<eos> This guy could be a full-on sexual deviant.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> - We don't.
You see, the thing about monogamy is nature doesn't wire us that way.<eos> Exactly!<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Guy like this, a lot of options.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Meat, stay back.<eos> All right, listen, we're gonna keep you out of sight, all right?<eos> 'Cause if they knew you were down here... they'd eat you.<eos> And you don't want to be eaten, do you?<eos> No, you don't.
That is some grade-A, 100% flank steak.<eos> Put a little bitty pat of butter on that.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I don't care if I'm starving or going insane.<eos> I am not eating a person.<eos> That's a bridge you can't uncross.<eos> Okay, so just... Aah!<eos> - Yo, Gary. - Uh-oh.<eos> I don't even think this dude wants to live.<eos> He doesn't.
Yes.<eos> Molly needs me to see this through.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You think more death is what she'd want?<eos> No, she'd want you just to get on with your life.<eos> You go after the prince and what?<eos> Maybe... maybe you get him, but then what, hmm?<eos> What happens to you?<eos> I don't matter.<eos> Yes, you do.
His back is to me, but his clothes are covered in blood.<eos> I didn't kill Molly.<eos> Put me on the stand.<eos> I want to testify against Prince Theo.<eos> Dr. Caldwell said that I-I-I disassociated when I saw her body like that.<eos> That's why I couldn't remember.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> I'm just sorry you had to go back there.<eos> At least now I know.<eos> We all do.
Get me off of here!<eos> You're a shit!<eos> You're a shit!<eos> Leave him alone! Do something!<eos> Do something!<eos> - Help me...<eos> - Alessio!<eos> Turn the water on!<eos> Alessio! Leave him alone!<eos> Do something, Patrizia!
What is happening now?<eos> I suggested she be friendlier; she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality.<eos> I got something you can slip into.<eos> - Oh... - Janet, no!<eos> No, Janet.<eos> Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?<eos> That nod meant no, apparently.<eos> Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors.<eos> They all truly belong here.<eos> Oh, yes they do, cutie-pants.
What do you think that means?<eos> You stole Tahani's diary.<eos> I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason.<eos> Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things.<eos> And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule.<eos> I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?<eos> First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire. Why would you even know that?<eos> Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.<eos> - She wrote that note.<eos> - No she didn't!
Yes. Okay.<eos> This is nice. It is nice.<eos> You're right..<eos> Cheers.<eos> What if I moved to Montauk?<eos> Why?<eos> To be with you.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on. - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.
This is nice. It is nice.<eos> You're right..<eos> Cheers.<eos> What if I moved to Montauk?<eos> Why?<eos> To be with you.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on. - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - Yeah. I do.
You haven't become her, Alison.<eos> Haven't I?<eos> Fires, oceans, and babies.<eos> Those are the things I could watch forever.<eos> Fires, oceans, babies.<eos> I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Good morning, I was hoping I could have a word with you.<eos> I don't remember seeing your name on my calendar.<eos> I just want to say I know the pressure you're under with such a high profile case.<eos> I'm sure you just want to get this right.<eos> That's why it'd be a shame if... with everyone's eyes on you, you got this all wrong because of your bias against my sister.<eos> Bias.<eos> What could I possibly have against your sister?<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> No, you don't.
Not this.<eos> That's something else.<eos> Me in this chair.<eos> I knew it was gonna happen.<eos> Don't think that way.<eos> I messed everything up in my life, and this is the result.<eos> We all mess things up.<eos> You can't even imagine the things I've messed up.<eos> I was saved by an angel, you know.<eos> I don't...
I'd... get out of bed.<eos> And come to your door. And look inside and...<eos> And I'd ask, "what are you doing, puddle?"<eos> And I wouldn't say anything.<eos> But you knew.<eos> You knew.<eos> You were making sure we hadn't gone anywhere in the night.<eos> Because.<eos> How could something so good ever last?<eos> And it didn't.
No, it's not.<eos> No, it's not! This...<eos> This is a great deal of blood!<eos> How...<eos> How do you not...<eos> How do you not recognize this?<eos> I mean...<eos> Come on! I can't...<eos> I can't keep doing this.<eos> Doing what?
Perfectly stable.<eos> How close did we come?<eos> I already told you, there's no way of knowing.<eos> It was pretty close, though.<eos> Doctor, I can't emphasize enough how important...<eos> FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20.<eos> And the technology beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
- Shut up. He's one of the FBI agents.<eos> Yeah. Who you shot at.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> Whatever happened to Protocol 3?<eos> I'm Traveler 3468.<eos> I received a message to come to these coordinates and give support.<eos> Who delivered the message?<eos> One of the Russians.<eos> Well, that's bullshit, 'cause that would... that would kill an adult.<eos> It did.
I know I'm a bit early.<eos> I figured I'd get a head start on...<eos> Carly, um...<eos> Our needs have actually changed, so I'm afraid we don't have a job to offer you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, if you wouldn't mind keeping me in mind for the future...<eos> Um, we're never gonna be able to offer you a job here, darling.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know why.<eos> No, I don't, actually.
I know what she's going through.<eos> Do you?<eos> What happened to "the mission comes first"?<eos> She just needs a little time.<eos> I'm sure she'll make the right decision.<eos> You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
I didn't feel any different.<eos> Neither will she.<eos> "She"?<eos> You'll be the same person, Marcy.<eos> So everyone keeps saying.<eos> My perspective is entirely selfish.<eos> I just don't want to lose you.<eos> All I know is... I just need to talk to David first.<eos> I didn't realize you had someone that important to you in your life.<eos> Neither did I.
I dub thee Annoying.<eos> Begone!<eos> Hey, Mom, can I talk to you about...<eos> Hey, did you hear?<eos> Danny is being inducted into the Westmore High School Hall of Athletes.<eos> I am so proud.<eos> I made everybody T-shirts!<eos> (shrieks gleefully) So, what'd you want to tell me?<eos> I didn't actually graduate from high school.<eos> Oh, yes, you did!
- Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Look, I appreciate that you both want to do the right thing, so I will let you retake the test.<eos> By the way, it's tomorrow.<eos> Do you happen to know if that was ever made into a movie?<eos> Dude, this is impossible.<eos> I'm never going to pass.<eos> What does biology have to do with life anyway?<eos> Look, man, I'd help you out, but I met the lovely Miss Jimenez in the teacher's lounge, and I offered to help grade some of her students' Spanish homework.<eos> - I didn't know you spoke Spanish.<eos> - I don't.
He was looking for death.<eos> He wanted someone guiltier than him to end his suffering.<eos> And you stopped him?<eos> Yes. Because I'm not innocent.<eos> Not in my heart.<eos> For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
She's alive.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause I know.<eos> You got to believe, okay?<eos> You got to believe.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What is that?<eos> It sounds like...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Just don't.
They've taken her.<eos> No, don't even think about it.<eos> They'll call us. You have to let me talk to the police now.<eos> Tramacca's gonna have people in there.<eos> They'll be tipped off!<eos> They'll shoot your mother and dump her on the side of the road.<eos> I cannot just sit here and do nothing! If you do anything to her, you won't...<eos> Mr Tramacca, I apologize.<eos> The woman behaved badly.<eos> Yes, she did.
You and Eddie made it up.<eos> And you were the kings, both of you.<eos> And the card game that never ended.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, me and Eddie started playing cards one day...<eos> Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on.<eos> There was no winner.<eos> So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next.<eos> And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on.<eos> How long did it?
'Cause he doesn't love you?<eos> Rather have no dad than one like yours.<eos> - Hit him, Gene!<eos> - Yeah, get him!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Stop, Gene!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Gary!<eos> Get over here and get his arm!<eos> Do it!
What do you want a 30-year-old gun for?<eos> Just in case.<eos> I got rid of that gun years ago.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> There's no time.<eos> It could already be too late.<eos> Gary called.<eos> He said you're sick, Mike.<eos> They didn't understand in 1988, and they don't understand now.<eos> And you do?
Make you feel good, right?<eos> Special hook.<eos> Make you want to live in that world.<eos> That's what "Candle Cove" is all about.<eos> You made this.<eos> Had you, didn't I?<eos> It's fan-fic.<eos> It's a love letter.<eos> You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.
Just wait. You'll understand.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - Hi, Daddy.<eos> How was your horseback riding lesson?<eos> Good.<eos> I rode Gypsy.<eos> I gave her an apple.<eos> Yeah? Did she have bad breath?<eos> That's because horses don't brush their teeth.<eos> But little girls do, don't they?
I don't understand.<eos> Now that we have the technique perfected, this next one should be much easier.<eos> Prep the patient for a bi-cranial trans-orbital resection and lobotomy.<eos> Now hold on!<eos> This is my patient. And I accept full responsibility for him.<eos> He can't just do that, can he?<eos> Can he?<eos> Well I have the cure for 10K fever right here.<eos> Well then, if you have this under control<eos> I do.
Grace Day was a lovely human being.<eos> She didn't deserve to die, that's all it was.<eos> I'd prefer if you'd refer to me in the present tense.<eos> You know, if you're gonna go on pretending to be her, you've got a lot of work to do.<eos> Look who's talking.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Your school record says your previous self was a recalcitrant bully whose only redeeming quality was a gift for something called... football.<eos> Trevor Holden wouldn't have given Grace the time of day...<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> Oh, but Trevor Holden did?
We're gonna give you some time to think.<eos> Seriously, I'm fine.<eos> Sir, a man was shot in the head in your apartment, and you're obviously holding back information, including the nature of your two cell phone calls prior to your calling 911.<eos> Head on downstairs, please.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Stop the car.<eos> I need to do something.<eos> What?<eos> We gotta stop doing this.<eos> - Doing what?
I sent them.<eos> I was just trying to protect you from her.<eos> And you did.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> You deserve a great mom, because you've always been one to us.<eos> And don't worry about Nana Lyle.<eos> We don't need her.<eos> Look... I know I'm not perfect, but I did the best that I could.<eos> I didn't know how to raise kids.<eos> Yeah, well... I didn't either.
She's alive.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm...<eos> You know that's not even her real hair color?<eos> Like, she's probably, like, mousy brown or something.<eos> So?<eos> So I'm just saying what else is she hiding?<eos> Why don't you like her?<eos> You don't like Devyn.<eos> I do now.
I'd like a pony too.<eos> You know I always wanted a pony?<eos> Hey, check it out.<eos> Help me.<eos> What, we gonna drive a bush?<eos> A bush with wheels there, smart-ass.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Next you're gonna tell me that you've got the keys, right?<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
Quiet, quiet.<eos> Do you hear anything?<eos> No.<eos> It probably left the tower. It's gone. It's gone.<eos> Shit! Shit!<eos> It left the tower, and it came in here!<eos> Dana, it's inside!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What do I do?
Who is that?<eos> That's my boy.<eos> - He's cute.<eos> - Aww, that's sweet.<eos> He passed away about a year ago, before all this started.<eos> - Jane, I'm so sorry.<eos> - We didn't know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He was supposed to be getting better, so I took a deployment.<eos> And then he didn't.
If you extrapolate the death rate around here, then we all die.<eos> I was in firefights in Afghanistan.<eos> You know who dies?<eos> People who think they're gonna die.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Anyone who thought they were coming back... came back.<eos> You think you're gonna die anytime soon?<eos> Honestly?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Like an animal or something, you know?<eos> Like, it was instinctual and...<eos> Dad, the one in that Reverend could fool people.<eos> Like he knew what he was doing, and he had a plan to kill me, and it should've worked.<eos> So if you put something smart inside of something else that already wants to eat your face off...<eos> - I get it, honey.<eos> - Yeah. I get it. I get it.<eos> Listen...<eos> How did it feel to kill him?<eos> I don't...
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, Jesus. Do you even have a license?<eos> Why, I have an English one.<eos> Uh, does that count?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> Listen. Now we have the chance.<eos> Shall we just blow out of here and go to Sag Harbor for the weekend?<eos> You don't want to meet them.<eos> Of course I do.
- Hai Lai.<eos> - Yes, what?<eos> Do you want to have a child with me?<eos> What?<eos> Let's have a child, you and me.<eos> Uh, I'll be right there.<eos> I'm doing something that's really important to me, and I would really appreciate it if you would give me the space to do that.<eos> - I give you the space.<eos> - Sorry. Do you want to do this or not?<eos> I really, really do.
Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'll die before I do any real harm, remember? Remember that?<eos> !<eos> A punishment from his people who were destroyed?<eos> A punishment given to only my people who were also destroyed.<eos> That's billions of people gone, murdered, and you... you, all this time to take your revenge and you said nothing?<eos> The choice isn't yours.<eos> God! If I didn't have this thing in my head...<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
Yeah, but that's what war is, though, isn't it?<eos> You're always waiting to die.<eos> You have no idea what war is.<eos> Sorry, what was that, April?<eos> We sit here and talk about war like we have the first clue.<eos> The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
- He'll find my brothers.<eos> - And then you'll be alone.<eos> Yeah, well, you have a choice then, don't you?<eos> Let it consume you and die yourself, or face your future with spite, with defiance.<eos> I do all of this for you.<eos> - If I lost you...<eos> - If I lost you...<eos> Six days, I thought of nothing but you.<eos> Six days thinking of how you smell and how your skin is soft on your neck and you don't understand football.<eos> I really don't.
Their heads together.<eos> Such an odd way to die.<eos> Not like eating an ice cream sundae, somebody sneaking up behind you, pulling a bag over your head.<eos> That's a whole different kind of death.<eos> Your friends in the house, that was something sacred.<eos> Cops I work with think they were deluded, but I know they're wrong.<eos> Problem is I can't explain why they're wrong.<eos> Who cares?<eos> The police don't matter.<eos> Who does?
I don't have my jacket anymore.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> That dude's wearing it.<eos> Okay, it doesn't even fit him!<eos> And I can't get it back because he doesn't know English.<eos> So whatever it is that has you all chill and totally okay with dying here, I want in.<eos> I want to do your drugs.<eos> Buddy, drugs are for expansion, not escapesion.<eos> You do not want drugs.<eos> Yes... I... do.
What?<eos> So we decided to form this furious four.<eos> Bob, seriously, man, one suggestion?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I mean, the baby is already asleep.<eos> Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
You're a good dreamer.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I guess.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So I guess you found the guy you were looking for?<eos> In the dream?<eos> You said, "He's here."<eos> Did I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you?
And I went to get them back, and she goes, "You're not having them."<eos> And I went, "But I...<eos> I always have them."<eos> And she went, "You're getting fat."<eos> So I did my drop-the-mic moment.<eos> I picked up the Coco Pops and went...<eos> And she snapped and went,<eos> "Do you want me to lose this baby?"<eos> And I went, "Um, fuck, that was quick!<eos> Of course I do.
The quality... - Of theater is just gone.<eos> - Of theater is just not there.<eos> - It's just not there.<eos> - Anymore.<eos> It's just not there.<eos> Well, let me tell you something.<eos> Black Americans have to keep fighting for good art.<eos> - A-men! Come...<eos> - We have to.<eos> We really do.
Fine.<eos> You go to sleep, but I'm taking you to the hospital first thing in the morning.<eos> Good night.<eos> Any sign of Malachi?<eos> No.<eos> But I think our Malachi problem is not quite the Malachi problem we have been imagining.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I believe he's alive.<eos> Well, if that's true, we don't have a Malachi problem at all.<eos> But we do.
That's why you lied about it when we looked into those rooms earlier.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> By, uh, your logic, if an oil executive books a room in my hotel, that makes me responsible for global warming.<eos> I want this murderer, I want his boss, and I want his heroin out of my county.<eos> Is there no crime anywhere you won't try to blame on me?<eos> Who do you work with at Manifest Destinations, Jacob?<eos> And where can I find him?<eos> Well, you know, I can't answer those questions, but here are a couple of questions and answers I can provide.<eos> Did I invite Manifest Destinations here?<eos> No, I did not.

Did I invite Manifest Destinations here?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Did I know about or have anything to do with a heroin operation?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> And if you have any other baseless accusations you need to level against me, I suggest you save them for the deposition.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> It's a Department of Transportation I.D.<eos> I thought Walt gave you the day off.<eos> He did.
And I want to be safe.<eos> I think there's a way we can do that.<eos> Manifest Destinations doesn't have a website or a single Yelp review.<eos> So, uh... how'd the deposition go?<eos> Not great.<eos> Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
He never answered. Never called back.<eos> Do you know if your daughter still has that letter that Tony sent?<eos> It might help shed some light on this.<eos> I shredded it for her own good.<eos> Two years, and she's still mooning over him.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is A-Asha with you?<eos> Um, no. She's not.<eos> - But you got my message.<eos> - Uh, yes, I did.
Jake, what the hell is going on?<eos> I haven't talked to Oscar, but I can assure you this is just one giant misunderstanding.<eos> Don't let him off the hook, Lou.<eos> What kind of misunderstanding leads a client to evade law enforcement?<eos> If Oscar were guilty, I wouldn't be here.<eos> - I'd be with him.<eos> - Ask him about the traffic cam.<eos> If he's innocent, how do you explain the video footage that places Oscar's car at the scene?<eos> Does this video footage capture the image of the driver?<eos> No, it does not.
Your daughter was blown up, Mrs. Valera.<eos> I'm saying she lost more than her legs.<eos> Stuff you don't see.<eos> If I hear from her, I'll tell her that you stopped by.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I know where she is.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I wanted to understand a few things.<eos> You think her father and I gave up on her?<eos> We didn't.
I appreciate what you did for me, but I don't want to be your personal full-time reclamation project.<eos> Do you know what your problem is?<eos> Well, off the top of my head,<eos> I got no home and no legs.<eos> You have too much pride.<eos> Come to my place.<eos> I may not get back on a board ever again, but I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I just got to do this part on my own. That's just it.<eos> You don't have to do this on your own.<eos> Yes, I do.
We all do.<eos> We see her in our dreams.<eos> She told us about you.<eos> How you'd wake up early and make breakfast so she could sneak out and make her sculptures.<eos> How, after your father left, she told you to go with him.<eos> She said, "Go be the hero of your own life."<eos> And you said to her, "A hero doesn't leave."<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I see her in my dreams.<eos> We all do.
It's not fair to you to ask you to have to settle for someone you'd have to hide from the world.<eos> Who says I'd be settling?<eos> So what happened to this queen and her bodyguard?<eos> They got married.<eos> They had two sons, who both did great things.<eos> One of them was called Jasper.<eos> Jasper Tudor.<eos> You may have heard of them, the Tudors.<eos> You take my breath away, you know that?<eos> Of course I do.
Luke told you about the CIA briefing, and that was illegal. And Lawrence Boch can compel you to testify, Laurel, if he thinks you have something to contribute.<eos> Does he think I have something to contribute?<eos> I would've said no, but he keeps... throwing your name out there.<eos> So... we need to give him something.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, he's a good man. And he wants the truth, n-not just a-a leak.<eos> And what's the truth?<eos> - Mr. Boch.<eos> - My guess is you have some information for me.<eos> - I do.
I'm dead, too.<eos> Alive, dead, we're just specks of dust.<eos> We blow away in the wind.<eos> But it makes no difference. We make no difference.<eos> Dead or alive is all the same.<eos> That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
If it was up to me, I'd let you starve.<eos> Let me guess: you're here to tell me how much time they're tacking onto my sentence.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how much.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna get to him, and I'm gonna get to you.<eos> Sorry, Frank, but you're not getting anything tacked onto your sentence.<eos> Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
And what inspires me is to be a lawyer.<eos> - You go to that school, you're gonna get infected with their lawyer mind-set and when you come out, you're not gonna give a shit about your fellow man.<eos> - If you think that, then you should've spent more time with me.<eos> Because you don't know me at all.<eos> Ms. Pearson, are you ready?<eos> - Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> - Is there a question?<eos> - Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> - Yeah, they sure as hell did.
That's not funny.<eos> It's Vladimir and Estragon.<eos> "Waiting for Godot."<eos> You know, when they brought "Godot" to America, it opened in Miami in this dinner theater.<eos> It was billed as the laugh riot of two continents, and it bombed.<eos> So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work.<eos> They wouldn't get it.<eos> It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
You're quite the catch these days, Romeo.<eos> I'm actually not.<eos> She was supposed to be someone else.<eos> I thought she left me a note, but afraid I'll never find out who sent it.<eos> It was me, you idiot!<eos> It was me!<eos> It was me!<eos> It was me!<eos> I wrote the note!<eos> You did?
Oh, just open the frickin' cage! Right. Right.<eos> Aha! Ha!<eos> All right, let's get you out here... Get away!<eos> Get away!<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're fired!<eos> What, what?<eos> No. Look, I realize you're upset, but<eos> - you have to give me another chance.<eos> - No, I don't.
I could. For a fee.<eos> All right.<eos> Guess I'll take you to him.<eos> Besides, this is a proposition that Escorpion will want to see in person.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
I don't care about that.<eos> You asked me to take a chance on you, and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?<eos> No, no, Mr. Bailey--<eos> You said you would fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you.<eos> Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Uh... I'm sorry.<eos> - Wha... the, uh...<eos> - Could he... Could Dr. Kushel have stopped himself from writing prescriptions?<eos> Uh, in my opinion, no.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he...<eos> - Fucking right I do.
- You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you know what's going on?<eos> What's the deal with them?<eos> No, I... I don't know.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'm gonna get you some water.<eos> Did he see you?<eos> Did he?
No criminal record, but the last few weeks, he suddenly appears all over Tyler's social media profile.<eos> Mouse, you dump his phone records?<eos> Yeah, there's dozens of calls between Tyler and Tony Chin, all less than two minutes in duration and at all sorts of crazy hours.<eos> Have Atwater and Ruzek take a run at this guy.<eos> You know, Tyler... he was 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine.<eos> - When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
I thought the page we were on was pretty damn good, but...<eos> Whatever, man, I'm over it.<eos> You know her?<eos> Just from the news.<eos> Aw, come on, Freddy.<eos> You used to bring all the girls around.<eos> Definitely not her.<eos> You still have access to McCoy's house?<eos> Now I'm starting to feel like your partner here thinks that I had something to do with this.<eos> Did you?
Oh, and, Mrs. Wheeler, I... uh...<eos> I know shouldn't have to say this, but please don't sleep with my Dad.<eos> Again.<eos> Okay.<eos> But only because I'm married.<eos> Not because you asked me.<eos> Wow, you're cleaning.<eos> You really do like Sam.<eos> More like shoving and hiding.<eos> But, yeah, I really do.
To her?<eos> Hey, Missy, you better watch your tone.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not to her, not to anyone.<eos> This is not real.<eos> But that hickey is gonna be.<eos> I thought that we had something special.<eos> No!<eos> We do!
Hey, Missy, you better watch your tone.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not to her, not to anyone.<eos> This is not real.<eos> But that hickey is gonna be.<eos> I thought that we had something special.<eos> No!<eos> We do!<eos> We do!
Coming from you?<eos> So, come on, who was that heartbreaker, hmm?<eos> He used to go out with Boo.<eos> Then he slept with someone else, and then she...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know, OK.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I've never really said how sorry I was.<eos> You should get the trainers.<eos> She'll say I don't know her.<eos> You don't.
It's simply a journey through my physical and sexual life, climaxing in a few pieces inspired by and moulded on your father.<eos> And there are photos.<eos> I've taken a photo of my naked body every year for the past 30 years.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I think it's important for women of all ages to see how my body has changed over the years.<eos> I think they have to have a healthy perspective on my body.<eos> - Don't they?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I mean, I don't need to tell you, but your father is a deeply sexual man.<eos> No, you don't.
No, no, she'll do it.<eos> - What the fuck was that?<eos> - What is he doing here?<eos> You're not going to Finland.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm helping.<eos> - He is...<eos> - He didn't try to kiss you.<eos> - He did.
Oh yeah, thanks.<eos> You know, she... She was sick for a little bit, so it was, you know, we were prepared for it<eos> -but thanks, you know.<eos> But... We've been clearing out her house a little bit and I think would have fix it up and...<eos> Maybe sell it, so...<eos> Fix it up yourself? Yeah.<eos> That's kind of what I do.<eos> Work on houses and stuff.<eos> You build them? You do all the...<eos> I do... I mostly do the dry wall stuff.
I carry around those hand warmer pads just in case my eyelids freeze shut.<eos> - I hate the cold.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - Phoenix. - Oh, okay.<eos> - I have a sister named Sarah.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> Uh-huh, yes, and have Monica call every patient that's been to the infusion center since Monday.<eos> Mm-hmm, yes, anyone with fever, chills, headaches, or nausea gets a blood draw.<eos> - How you doing?
1949.<eos> - Told you.<eos> - Uh, one interesting fact...<eos> Peggy Carter herself oversaw construction of this base.<eos> Most people know the legend of Peggy Carter, but there's so many stories that were never recorded.<eos> I remember one time...<eos> You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else... what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
Hey, stop.<eos> Fitz, we could really use that exit.<eos> If I release the door, all the doors in cellblock A open.<eos> - The s-security wings, the exterior exits...<eos> - Just do it!<eos> Go, go!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
I hate that the media's calling it that.<eos> Burrows says it's terrible branding.<eos> But either way, this is a battle for hearts and minds.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Facts, Simmons.<eos> I need cold, hard, scientific facts to back up our case during this debate.<eos> I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing. I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
"A team that trusts is a team --"<eos> don't.<eos> Gabe: Robbie.<eos> Hey, what's up, man?<eos> Look, uh, sorry about all the drama.<eos> I'm just glad to see you're safe.<eos> Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> I thought you trusted me.<eos> Well, I do.
Eli Morrow just wiped out an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. Tac Team with a few shards of carbon that he created out of thin air.<eos> And that's just what we've seen.<eos> What else is he capable of?<eos> We need the big guns on this one, and Yo-Yo, Daisy, and Reyes are the biggest guns we have.<eos> What about the science team?<eos> And I'm talking about Aida, specifically.<eos> I mean, she did, after all, bring you and Agent Fitz back from ... well, wherever the hell you were.<eos> If a similar technology is in play, she could have a solve.<eos> What? You disagree?<eos> - I don't, actually.
Quake was here the entire time.<eos> But she was not responsible for the danger here today.<eos> Agent Johnson... saved us all.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> You'll thank me later.<eos> We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
I'm going to meet my dad.<eos> I'm going to meet my dad.<eos> I'm going to meet my dad.<eos> I know Lucy's got her heart set on this, but I still have my misgivings.<eos> We only want what's best for her.<eos> Hey, I helped bring little Lucy into this world.<eos> I ain't about to let anything happen to her.<eos> Believe me.<eos> So you knew my mommy?<eos> Well I sure did, sweetheart.

Elizabeth, someone is stalking our family.<eos> How could a former student who is obsessed with you not be relevant?<eos> He just wanted me to be his thesis advisor.<eos> He wanted you to be a lot more than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.

Just like we didn't think they were in Rome.<eos> Let's check with DEA.<eos> See if we can trace this back to the seller.<eos> Susan.<eos> I'm sorry to disrupt your schedule, Madam Secretary.<eos> N-No, no, no.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The...fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.<eos> - You know how that goes.<eos> - I do.
Everything's fake!<eos> I quit.<eos> We lost the third baby, Jack.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I like to think that you took the sourest lemon that life has to offer and turned it into something resembling lemonade.<eos> Guys, breakfast!<eos> Mom, Webster told me to shut up.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Do not call him that.<eos> Everyone else always does.
I'll get her.<eos> Mum?<eos> Mum...<eos> We need to go soon, we can't be late.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I was... trying to decide what to wear, and then I realised it doesn't bloody matter.<eos> Adam doesn't give a damn whether I wear the stupid dress or the skirt or the...<eos> He doesn't give a damn whether I go to his funeral at all.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I do.
Don't make the mistake of underestimating this person, Detective.<eos> He doesn't just have people killing for him, he has them sending him pictures, evidence of his work.<eos> That is a highly sophisticated form of manipulation.<eos> The government of Hawaii has empowered us to do whatever is necessary to, uh, to catch whoever's responsible.<eos> So I need you to tell me what it's gonna take for you to come and work for us, temporarily, of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm... I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
Oh, no.<eos> What's wrong, Jaimie?<eos> I think my mom might've said a bad thing, Officer Bucky.<eos> Like a bad word?<eos> No.<eos> Much worse than a bad word.<eos> Uh, but I don't know if I should tell anybody.<eos> Was it about the company, Jaimie?<eos> Mm-hmm. I don't want to get my mom in trouble.<eos> Of course you don't.
It's just this promotion.<eos> You know, they need to see I really want it.<eos> You don't have to want it.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Think we're doing pretty well for ourselves.<eos> Who is this adorable little munchkin?<eos> Hi, my name is Hazel.<eos> I'm a Spiga Scout Leader, and I have a question for you today.<eos> Do you like chocolate?<eos> Well, yes, I do.
You strike me as the type who doesn't have time for bullshit.<eos> - You're direct.<eos> - Really?<eos> What else do you see in your crystal ball?<eos> You work hard.<eos> You're tough as nails.<eos> And your father would cut my balls off if he saw me talking to his little girl.<eos> Mm, I'm sure he wouldn't be the first to try.<eos> - See, you know me, too.<eos> - I don't.

And they just need to believe it's Diana Walters.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Let go!<eos> Stop.<eos> Ah! Stop! Pull over!<eos> Please!<eos> Ow! No, please!<eos> Hey! Hey! What's going on here?<eos> This woman works for you, ma'am?<eos> She does.
Do we have any quick thinkers in the room?<eos> Now is your moment to shine.<eos> The kill switch and its trigger, they're connected wirelessly.<eos> If we find the frequency, we can hack the Kusari and disarm it.<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> We don't know what kind of firewall it has.<eos> It could kill her as soon as we try to break in.<eos> Share your wisdom with us, then.<eos> How do you propose we disarm it?<eos> We don't.
And what about before that, when you were on your break?<eos> Were you seeing other people? - No.<eos> - Did she?<eos> No.<eos> You sure?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What if you were having a dream, and in that dream she was married to another man?<eos> I'd know it was a dream.<eos> What if it was actually true? That she had a husband?<eos> She didn't.
You see, the same clever discovery that set you free is also the detail that will put you back behind bars.<eos> Who took it?<eos> Who took what?<eos> The cocoa.<eos> Someone stole it, I presume to protect me.<eos> And I guess you found them out.<eos> Who was it?<eos> - Why would he say that?<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> - Maybe he didn't do it.
Take the kick!<eos> We won!<eos> We won!<eos> We're going to the Olympic bloody Games!<eos> God!<eos> You'll deserve any medal they win as if you were right there with them.<eos> McNabb!<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> Being here for this match means the world to me.<eos> Just what old friends do.
Yes, but you were interrupted by a murder.<eos> Oh yes, that.<eos> Of all mornings for Rex Grey to act upon his murderous impulses.<eos> I'm surprised you're so dismissive, Newsome.<eos> All the reasons why your fellow birdwatchers were killed. They're equally as applicable to you.<eos> I suppose I am in danger, aren't I?<eos> You'll be safe with us.<eos> Let's get to the hotel.<eos> But if the constabulary had more evidence, you wouldn't require my testimony?<eos> Well, we don't.
You could moonlight as a mortician, Miss James.<eos> Between this and my studies, I'm doing more than enough Moonlighting.<eos> I should think, I can almost see the life returning to his cheeks, Miss James.<eos> William, where do you get your hair cut?<eos> I don't believe you have ever mentioned going to the barber.<eos> Oh, it's nowhere special.<eos> Surely the barber shop has a name.<eos> I can't recall.<eos> You, William Murdoch, the man who remembers everything, can not recall where he has his hair cut?<eos> No, I don't.
But the evidence is damning and the alternative explanation is preposterous.<eos> Yes. Well, gentlemen, are you ready to hear my findings?<eos> - Go on then.<eos> - This sword might be the murder weapon.<eos> - Might be?<eos> I wish I could answer more conclusively.<eos> But the attack was made in a frenzy.<eos> The stab wounds are not clean, so I can't determine exactly the width of the blade.<eos> If only Mr. Pendrick had some memory of the night in question.<eos> - Maybe he does.
Seth is working on my eulogy for your father's service later today.<eos> We were hoping you might have something personal to share.<eos> Um, my dad was... He was a great man...<eos> I had tremendous respect for him.<eos> ...as a president, but, um, you know, to me, he was just...<eos> Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
- Don't act like I'm some kind of dick.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> I gave you a compliment.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> Look at that!<eos> I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do. You do.
William Faulkner once said... "The past is never dead, in fact it's not even the past"<eos> What?<eos> Your 'BU taught you "is?<eos> Hey I want to go to this 'BD'<eos> Raguu!<eos> Take it take it...<eos> No I don't need it<eos> Stop acting pricey...<eos> 1 know you like Raguu<eos> No, I don't
You could've mentioned this technique 15 minutes ago.<eos> Screen six. There it was.<eos> There what was?<eos> You used to be such a patient person.<eos> So, pay no attention to the young man attempting the free throw.<eos> There's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
Can you back up your theory?<eos> Well, my theories were good enough for you in '09 in Iraq.<eos> This is different, Hannah, and you know it.<eos> Besides, I've already talked to General Cochrane and the Joint Chiefs.<eos> But you're still gonna brief the President later, right?<eos> Best to give them all the theories, don't you think?<eos> So if it wasn't Al-Sakar, who blew up the Capitol Building?<eos> I don't know, yet, and that's what scares me.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> Okay, w-what do I do?
Want to be the first to peep my badass movie monster and epic CGI skills?<eos> It's just CG, computer graphics.<eos> What could the "I" possibly stand for?<eos> Incredible.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Watch this, watch this.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> That's not even remotely how this program is supposed to work.<eos> Oh, I like it when a woman takes charge.<eos> Yes, I do.
A man with him was murdered.<eos> Was they, - Was this guy a cop?<eos> No.<eos> He was a bouncer at some place that they were.<eos> A massage parlor in Oakland.<eos> I think maybe Raymond has an interest in it. I --<eos> Do you think that, or do you know that?<eos> Well, I hear things.<eos> I don't know anything for sure when it comes to him.<eos> No one does.
Well then, what is?<eos> The bad guys are running around everywhere with these high-tech weapons.<eos> I just think it's about time the good guys got some of our own.<eos> Alien guns are bad no matter who controls them.<eos> The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms.<eos> Even if those arms are ray guns.<eos> That's what Cadmus wants.<eos> They're the ones handing out these weapons, They want us to be afraid of each other. to not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I just do.
And you came.<eos> I should let you get some rest.<eos> No, stay.<eos> Stay.<eos> Until you fall asleep.<eos> - Danvers! Hey, I was hoping you'd turn up.<eos> Any interest in a game?<eos> Well, actually, I was wondering if you were still good for that drink you promised me.<eos> You told Kara?<eos> Yeah, you did!
How could you?<eos> You were eight.<eos> I remember that dinner.<eos> Alligators in the sewer.<eos> She was funny, right? She is.<eos> Look, you and I, we... we... we don't know each other that well yet, kiddo.<eos> Not really, but... but I want you to know that I'm gonna do everything in my power to save her.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> After that, I don't really care what happens to me.<eos> I do.
What are you doing?<eos> Illinois Compiled Statutes.<eos> Emergency Admission by Certification,<eos> Section 3.610, right here.<eos> "Not later than 24 hours, the respondent," that's Casey, "shall be examined a second time by a psychiatrist,"<eos> and that didn't happen.<eos> - Mom, it did.<eos> - No. Not the way the law states.<eos> Look, "The psychiatrist shall not be the person who executed the first certificate."<eos> They didn't do that.
What about you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably look for Lyle's parents, I guess.<eos> Walk with me?<eos> 20 more minutes in this place.<eos> Longest minutes of my life.<eos> Hey, can I tell you something?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You want to know what I did to get into detention?<eos> Do I?
Don't listen to him, Father.<eos> Jafar is controlling you.<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> So, I can do what I want to you.<eos> You stay away from me.<eos> The Savior will be here soon.<eos> Oh, do you mean Aladdin?<eos> The thief with a heart of gold, or is it the heart that desires gold?<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Who are you? !<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I could have listened to Mac.<eos> I could have had field ops open the box.<eos> And now I have to tell parents that their daughter is dead because of a decision I made.<eos> It's a decision that saved millions of lives.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But it doesn't make knocking on that door any easier.<eos> No. No, it doesn't.
He has a daughter?<eos> Granddaughters.<eos> Twin teenagers.<eos> - He dotes on him. - BULL:<eos> He's in.<eos> Tell me about this ray of sunshine,<eos> Tom. MARISSA: 64.<eos> Divorced.<eos> Three times.<eos> We did a motivational matrix on Tom.
Turns out Mike was about to blow the whistle on the team using steroids, so the coach had motive to kill Mike and Ellen.<eos> You were right.<eos> Mm. You came all the way here to tell us this?<eos> Actually, I came to talk to you.<eos> Mm, I haven't had a sip of this yet.<eos> I'm gonna go play guitar.<eos> I was impressed.<eos> That passion... that's what I first remember about you when you started at the D.A.'s office.<eos> Look, Amanda, you don't have to.<eos> No, I do.
I'd like to observe how things work when you guys are not in the parking lot screaming like lunatics and then we can go from there.<eos> Think we can handle that?<eos> - I guess we'll see.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'm sorry, we're the ones who need to change?<eos> How about they stop limiting our hours or docking our pay for bathroom breaks?<eos> We are not the ones who need to improve here.<eos> Yeah, we're pretty perfect.<eos> But, look, he wants to hear our complaints.<eos> Yeah, and then not do anything about them.
You hate me?<eos> - No, I love you.<eos> I... why is this so complicated?<eos> - Oh, ah, hey, Jeff. I was just telling this employee how lazy I think he is.<eos> - You think I'm lazy?<eos> - Yes...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, I-I try really, really hard.<eos> I always thought you liked me.<eos> I don't.
We got to get proof, something solid that -- so it's not his word against ours, like you said.<eos> Yeah, well, he's running a business, so there's got to be data somewhere.<eos> Laptop would be my guess.<eos> That, or some kind of device, anyway, something that he wouldn't risk going anywhere without.<eos> Crown Vic's an easy car to break into.<eos> Pop the taillight with a screwdriver gets you access to the trunk.<eos> Hand drill gets you into the back seat.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got -- records, money transfers, pictures, videos.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> When? When do we do this?
I know he's not perfect.<eos> I know he's broken inside, but I can fix all that.<eos> He's not just broken, Celia.<eos> He's dying.<eos> He's got a congenital defect in his aorta.<eos> It's inoperable.<eos> One of these days, his heart's just going to explode.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know about that.<eos> Everybody does.
Your Holiness, don't you feel well?<eos> No, no.<eos> Just a passing discomfort.<eos> - Should I call the doctor?<eos> - No, no, no, it's nothing serious.<eos> It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
I've counted.<eos> But all the world leaders from the summit are in Federal Hall.<eos> They don't want them. Why?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Sit down.<eos> All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
Yesterday when you gave me the shears.<eos> But... but you got rid of them.<eos> I told my family I was worried somebody would use them as a weapon against me.<eos> That's not true?<eos> I was... worried that I might use them.<eos> Every time I think about the vision of my future, and I think about my trembling hand and... imagine my family having to watch me die.<eos> And I wish I never became the Savior.<eos> So I knew I could not have that thing anywhere near me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What do I do now?
Well, you know I can't say no to booze.<eos> If I could, I'd still be in The Temptations.<eos> No, no, no, it's very little booze, okay?<eos> See, you drink it for the raw cacao.<eos> Yeah, it releases serotonin and boosts your energy and your mood.<eos> I'm pretty much a genius.<eos> And I'm pretty much gonna pass.<eos> You want to try a Cacao Storm?<eos> Huh, buddy?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Wow, Sophie got her sexy back.<eos> Yeah, and front and under.<eos> Sophie, you deserve a flan-tini.<eos> And so do I.<eos> Oh, you know what, I did what you told me to do and I dropped baby Barbara off at the trainer/babysitter, and I had a bunch of Korean ladies go to town on me.<eos> Hey, where's Oleg?<eos> I told him to meet me here.<eos> Sophie?<eos> You look as beautiful as the day we first did it on the sink.<eos> Damn straight, I do!
Hang on a second.<eos> Where did this come from?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> There's no return address.<eos> But I must've picked it up on my route.<eos> What's the route?<eos> Uh, Kahala primarily. Uh, Diamond Head to Kealaolu.<eos> That's got to be three square miles.<eos> You you like... everything... perfect.<eos> Don't you?
I mean, hot girls always stick together.<eos> And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.<eos> You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.<eos> Well, it's not exactly like it.<eos> We're all extremely smart.<eos> Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee.<eos> You want some? Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.

Good luck.<eos> I should have never let you talk me into this.<eos> Rog, come on, it was the only way.<eos> I mean, I love the man, but he stole 150 bricks of cold hard cash.<eos> 149.<eos> - No, it was 150. - Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
See, no reason you can't be stylish and covered.<eos> There you go.<eos> What is this?<eos> That's called a medieval torture device.<eos> What's a medieval torture device?<eos> Umm, it's when you want to hurt somebody really really badly.<eos> What's it doing in here?<eos> We'll go over sarcasm later.<eos> That's a thing that women used to wear.<eos> Some probably do actually still.
Digital tomography of the pillar will show exactly where interior instability lies.<eos> I'll calculate its load-bearing capacity.<eos> And a software we designed will let me engineer a rebuild.<eos> And I'll use six specialized biochemicals I mixed myself to pinpoint what molds, bacteria, or polysaccharides are causing the problem.<eos> Thousands of years ago, fungi was used to adhere concrete, and those spores could've been reactivated from L.A. pollution, Pacific salt air, or something else.<eos> We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
Why so far from home?<eos> There's plenty to steal in South America.<eos> Yeah, and why would they steal a few million in gems when this place has a lot more valuable stuff?<eos> Because it's not about money-- it's about a bomb.<eos> There's an asteroid in this exhibit.<eos> Its core contains an extremely rare substance called tantalum-181.<eos> That's what they came here for.<eos> Peralta.<eos> How do asteroid guts make a bomb?<eos> They don't.
Much worse.<eos> I need to tell you what I've been up to this last week.<eos> I've had your DNA tested again.<eos> We were able to get hold of Cyrus's DNA from his...<eos> Well, it doesn't matter where we got it, but it's done.<eos> That tests have proven, without a doubt... that Simon is your biological father... and I'm your mother, but you know that.<eos> I always knew he was our father.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> - She doesn't?

One of these days, you'll find someone like that to love again and that'll fix everything.<eos> I'll keep that in mind, fish lady.<eos> Your mom just told me the good news.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I mean, congratulations, Your Majesty. Stop.<eos> Stop. Thank you.<eos> You believed I could be King before anyone else.<eos> Before even I did.<eos> It meant the world to me.<eos> It still does.
You got someplace you can stay tonight, so you won't be alone?<eos> She could stay with me.<eos> Better whiskey there, anyway.<eos> It might be better to get her into an FBI safe house, you know?<eos> You're adorable, but I can handle myself just fine, thank you.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> She's tough.<eos> Trust me, you do not want to mess with Miss Loretta.<eos> No, I don't.
I wanted to pay my respects to Commander Clarkson.<eos> Thank you for your incredible bravery.<eos> Just doing my job, sir.<eos> You know, Max wasn't even supposed to be in the raid.<eos> He was supposed to coordinate the mission off site.<eos> But when Denton got injured in the chopper crash, Max took his place to ensure the operation would go as planned.<eos> It's because of him none of those kids were hurt... and I get to see the birth of my first child.<eos> I should've waited for a better window of opportunity.<eos> Don't, sir. Feel guilty?<eos> A little part of me does, as well.
We'll have about two seconds to make it before we hit the tracks at 100 miles an hour.<eos> That sounds awesome!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now we, uh... We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Speaking of order...<eos> I need to know more about what my team is doing.<eos> I think I know how we can find out.<eos> But, I will need a partner.<eos> Are you game?<eos> I'm your man.<eos> Perfect.<eos> First, we'll need some supplies for your science project.<eos> I don't have a science project due.<eos> Well, you do now.
She must be activating the bug software that's messing with the Penter server!<eos> Penter server?<eos> Something's messing with the election.<eos> Well, things just got a lot more complicated, because that woman is Sophia Vasquez...<eos> It's the president's chief of staff.<eos> All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
Thanks?<eos> Hold up.<eos> I present to you the mother of L.A. sporting events, and you're doing paperwork?<eos> Paperwork's not gonna do itself.<eos> You don't want to go.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
He and his lady friend were victims of a home invasion this morning.<eos> Owens specializes in nuclear propulsion system designs.<eos> That's a long list of enemies that would like that technology.<eos> We got an I.D. on the attacker? Mm-hmm.<eos> Robert Collier. He's a repeat felon.<eos> He was killed during the attack.<eos> Odd to have a common criminal target naval technology.<eos> Unless someone hired him.<eos> How did Commander Owens kill the intruder?<eos> He didn't.
"What's time to a pig?"<eos> That's a riddle.<eos> Or what is it?<eos> No, I hate riddles.<eos> It asks you to consider whether the baggage you carry is really necessary, or if it could just be set aside, if only you'd try.<eos> That girl you stalked.<eos> Was she a patient?<eos> He wanted me to see it.<eos> Thought it would scare me off.<eos> But it didn't.
Give or take.<eos> My memory of it's not the best.<eos> Did you see her after, ever, seen her since?<eos> No.<eos> And, between her and me, there was no one else?<eos> Not like that.<eos> Not like you.<eos> There was my wife.<eos> She didn't know what she was getting into.<eos> Still doesn't.

Venga, pues, pásele.<eos> Cuídate, Jackie.<eos> It's all here.<eos> How much he makes, how he cleans it, where it goes.<eos> Your cop friend will understand it, even if you don't.<eos> She said you weren't coming back.<eos> She just wanted to be the one with you.<eos> I think she gets tired, being the strong one.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
Yeah, but she's not a suspect, she's FBI.<eos> If she makes us, we lose our only lead on Elvis.<eos> Probably our jobs.<eos> Yeah, so be quiet.<eos> Oh, you be quiet.<eos> I got this.<eos> Dad-gummit.<eos> Ugh, I told you.<eos> She made us.<eos> She did not.
Only if you talk to the prosecutor about reducing my sentence.<eos> I don't like this place.<eos> Real criminals in here.<eos> Fine.<eos> Deal.<eos> Was that your plan?<eos> Just to agree to whatever I wanted?<eos> And then screw me over, because as desperate as you are, you and I both know that you would never let me out of here.<eos> Do you like Batman?<eos> I don't.
Gather round. - Yes, yes. Yes, indeed.<eos> - What's the plan?<eos> - We're gonna show 'em our talent.<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Who wants to see what he's gonna do?<eos> - I do!
- We good? - Mm-hmm.<eos> We fly.<eos> "The malicious have a dark happiness."<eos> Victor Hugo.<eos> Bridget and Scott Bergstrom grew up in Winona and have deep ties to the community.<eos> Scott was a local distributor of farm equipment. Bridget cut hair at a salon in the mall.<eos> Yet they were murdered by a family annihilator.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> The Bergstrom family had their share of dirty laundry.<eos> Though who of us does not?
- It appears that way, sir.<eos> - But we have a location for them.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> This ELT signal's an older model.<eos> Analog frequency. No digital signal to carry GPS coordinates.<eos> ELTs are notoriously unreliable, especially if they're... submerged underwater.<eos> We've narrowed the search field to 220 square miles.<eos> SAR teams are gearing up now.<eos> I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen, but I don't know if I have the strength to lose her again.<eos> None of us do.
That train-- you're telling me it just disappeared?<eos> Tom, Tom!<eos> If you can hear us, say something.<eos> Singleton Freight Station, mile marker 272.<eos> That's where you said and we're here, but, look, nothing's come through.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> There's only one rail line in the area.<eos> The train was going at least 40.<eos> It should've passed you two minutes ago.<eos> No, it didn't.
You should be able to access the system from a utility module in the fire panel.<eos> All right, Aram. Talk to me.<eos> There should be a circuit board on the lower right corner.<eos> Aram, what the hell is going on?<eos> Uh, yeah, hold on.<eos> W-We're working on it.<eos> Hold on?<eos> We have less than a minute.<eos> All right, I found the circuit board.<eos> - What do I do?
You picked up Hammers.<eos> You had evidence. You did nothing!<eos> We had nothing!<eos> There was no body. There was no complaint.<eos> Jesus, come on. It was Christmas Eve.<eos> I thought the boys got in a bit of a scrap.<eos> "Bit of a scrap"?<eos> My father trusted you!<eos> Did you even read Shane's autopsy report?<eos> You did!
Step two, uh... sandpaper his back?<eos> I have the weirdest job.<eos> The rough surface will ensure his circuit-board backpack stays glued in place.<eos> Push down. He's good.<eos> All right, perfect.<eos> Next, I have to trim his antennae... and, I kid you not, attach a teeny-tiny electrode wire to each one.<eos> Go in the hole.<eos> And all the while keeping him on ice to make sure he doesn't wake up.<eos> -How do you know it's a him?<eos> -Actually, I don't.
Bring Lenny up on the monitor please.<eos> How's Eugene doing?<eos> The uremia causing his confusion has cleared up, but his white cells are still elevated, and he still has active hemolysis and toxin production.<eos> His infection isn't going away.<eos> If we can't clear this infection, his kidneys will be permanently damaged and more of his organs will begin to fail.<eos> Look at the E. Coli in Nora's blood sample.<eos> They're covered in antibodies.<eos> No antibodies in Eugene's sample.<eos> So Nora's white blood cells produce antibodies, that can fight the bacteria and stop the toxin.<eos> Eugene's don't.
- Unfortunately, no.<eos> We're working as fast as we can, but may take at least a few hours to get all systems back online.<eos> He's been having symptoms since yesterday, he may not have too long<eos> - before his appendix ruptures.<eos> - Is there some kind of lifeboat to get him back to Earth?<eos> - The Russian Soyuz capsule.<eos> - Even if he could get to it, the force of gravity alone on the journey could burst his appendix.<eos> Lenny, we're gonna try to override that lockdown.<eos> But in the meantime, do you have a pulse oximeter there?<eos> - I do.

So, how's it going?<eos> Weird.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It started with the I'm gonna hurl first day jitters, but now there's this.<eos> I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.
Scandal? Enter, or rather re-enter, the father.<eos> He's distraught that his children are feuding.<eos> He want them to patch things up so they can be a family again, and, today, Gabriel is flying in. Him and Tara have agreed to meet at a coffee shop.<eos> They're going to swallow their pride and maybe, just maybe, they will put the past behind them.<eos> Sweet, right?<eos> Yeah, it's really...<eos> No, it's terrible, because what if he asks for money? What if she can't say no?<eos> What if she gets caught up in his whirlwind of manipulation?<eos> Did she put it that way?<eos> No, I did.
Where were you born?<eos> Army base, Fort Rucker.<eos> Right.<eos> In, uh, Georgia?<eos> No.<eos> Alabama.<eos> With stops in Okinawa and Hamburg?<eos> Other way around. Hamburg first.<eos> What did you major in at Yale?<eos> I didn't.
He needed something different.<eos> Something I... That I just couldn't give him.<eos> Daddy, you did your best.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> Pause the video.<eos> Zoom in on the wrist, Garcia.<eos> That rope, it's called shibari.<eos> It's an intricate form of BDSM bondage.<eos> The last time Mr. Scratch needed BDSM gear, he used a fake name. My name, actually. My name, actually, to buy it.<eos> Well, maybe he did the same thing with Carl Brubaker.
Blood.<eos> That must be where Bryce and Jody got attacked by the bats.<eos> And that's got to be the chute Jody fell in.<eos> Jody?<eos> Jody?<eos> She could be unconscious by now.<eos> We are not alone.<eos> It's just like The Birds.<eos> Probably didn't see that film.<eos> I did.
Take your pick.<eos> That punk had problems with everyone in the school.<eos> How many had problems with him?<eos> What, you're looking for a list or something?<eos> His death wasn't accidental.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> Abbs, McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
I'm not a prince.<eos> I'm just a middle schooler wearing Grandpa's tie.<eos> Now, don't sell yourself short, Henry.<eos> Never do that.<eos> You will always be royalty no matter what world you live in.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Someday we might go back to my castle.<eos> And you might be king.<eos> I kind of think I need to finish high school first.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Anybody would like to have some jet in their car.<eos> Actually, we've been doing a little bit of experimenting, Hammond.<eos> I've made a prototype. This is a gearstick with a jet knob on the top.<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> I mean, it's not polished yet, but you change gear.<eos> It does make your hand a bit dirty.<eos> But, no, that's a handy reminder. It is.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No, you're absolutely right 'cause you know, sometimes you drive an unfamiliar car, you're on the motorway and you think, "Oh, did I change into sixth?<eos> Yeah, I did."
Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> And welcome to The Grand Tour, which, once again, is in Whitby.<eos> There is actually a very good reason for that.<eos> It is because these two last week blew up my house, and I literally have nowhere else to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Plus-<eos> - Plus, James May lost the tent bag.<eos> - Soz.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
You know, it's a very good point, because a racing car on the road is a bit like trying to play tennis with a cricket bat.<eos> It's technically possible...<eos> Two totally different disciplines.<eos> The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> Mm.<eos> You erm...<eos> You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
But there's no danger of that happening this week, because our guest is actually starting in the harbour.<eos> He is one of Britain's top comedians and a jet-ski enthusiast.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jimmy Carr!<eos> Here he comes now, look, on the screen... and he's looking good!<eos> He is.<eos> What are we going to ask him when he gets here?<eos> I'm gonna ask him, actually, about erm... that story he told me once when we were on holiday.<eos> No, you can't ask him about that on air.<eos> Ofcom, they won't like it.<eos> Why does Ofcom...
- In an Alfa Romeo--<eos> - This is tremendous!<eos> In an Alfa Romeo looking good is more important than looking where you're going.<eos> -That's a shame.<eos> -When are you gonna do that?<eos> It was now time to get down to business.<eos> But first, we went out for some sighting laps. Whoa!<eos> It's all skiddy!<eos> - Oh, this is very narrow.<eos> - James did this.
He's ruined it!<eos> Anyway, erm...<eos> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the greatest battle in motorsport history.<eos> The story begins in the 1960s, when Ford realised that they could sell a lot more cars if they were a lot more successful on the racetrack.<eos> So they formulated a brilliant plan, but unfortunately it went disastrously wrong, didn't it, Bob?<eos> Ford knew that if you wanted to rule in motorsport, there was only one race that mattered.<eos> The toughest and most dangerous of them all - the 24 Hours of Le Mans.<eos> Levegh's Mercedes collides and blows up.<eos> The problem was, for all its might, Ford didn't have a clue how to win at Le Mans.<eos> However, over in Italy, someone did.
Just so you know, this is stupid.<eos> What's stupid?<eos> How would you recognise a poacher when you saw one?<eos> - And when you find one, what are you gonna do?<eos> - Shoot him.<eos> All we're doing on our journey is driving three beach buggies to the Angolan border.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Which doesn't further the cause of humanity.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And this does, does it?
She gave us food.<eos> And you stole from her.<eos> And what?<eos> Young.<eos> Much younger then you, Corporal.<eos> Why would I need an old one?<eos> I was drafted right after the wedding.<eos> So you didn't have a chance to dip, sir.<eos> You snot.<eos> I did.
No.<eos> I'm not that loud squawky person that's like,<eos> "Hey, here's what we need to do."<eos> Sounds like a personal boundary that needs some crossing.<eos> No way.<eos> Deirdre doesn't like anyone else talking in Morning Meeting.<eos> She's so in love with the sound of her own...<eos> Voice!<eos> I mean, it's got powers.<eos> It does something to me.
How does it feel to be dying?<eos> It feels... like all these beautiful pieces of life are flying around me and... I'm trying to catch them.<eos> When my granddaughter falls asleep in my lap, I try to catch the feeling of her breathing against me.<eos> And when I make my son laugh, I try to catch the sound of him laughing.<eos> How it rolls up from his chest.<eos> But the pieces are moving faster now, and I can't catch them all.<eos> I can feel them slipping through my fingertips.<eos> And soon where there used to be my granddaughter breathing and my son laughing, there will be... nothing.<eos> I know it feels like you have all the time in the world.<eos> But you don't.
I love American cheese..<eos> - English cheese is so blue, it's angry.<eos> - Yeah. American cheese is like a... a bed you can just fall into.<eos> So, whose good-bye party is this anyway?<eos> Frank Pendergrass... tree branch fell on him three days ago when he was jogging through Central Park.<eos> Bang.<eos> Dead.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> You knew him how?<eos> I didn't.
That's pretty cool, buddy.<eos> Didn't know you were so good with numbers.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What about this wall right here?<eos> How many... how many do I need for that?<eos> I don't know that one.<eos> You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?<eos> I don't know it, Dad.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I don't.
I have a daughter.<eos> Lucy.<eos> She's 9 years old.<eos> They just want to know about the drives.<eos> Please don't let me die in here.<eos> Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
If Miranda's wrong and Owen and the AIC haven't tapped any recruits yet, who do you think he's gonna be looking for?<eos> Someone who can go too far or someone who doesn't go far enough?<eos> Well, I know what I'm capable of.<eos> What worries me is what this experience is doing to you.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> I'm the man I've always been...<eos> Or is that what you're worried about?<eos> Feel good?<eos> Like you proved something to me today?<eos> Because you didn't.
Not one word until you talk to a lawyer.<eos> You found a laptop and six phones, but took none of it?<eos> I couldn't risk getting caught by Lydia.<eos> I had to get out of there.<eos> You could've taken a phone or a photo, or... or memorized call logs.<eos> I can still get them, Shelby.<eos> What if they're not there when you go back?<eos> Do you think I'm not cut out for this?<eos> - I just wish you'd taken the risk.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
I'm from...<eos> Jeez, how do I explain this?<eos> Report.<eos> Garcia Flynn stole the tape from the White House.<eos> We didn't have a chance to stop him.<eos> Nixon was on it. He sounded terrified about Rittenhouse, mentioned something about a document.<eos> Destroy the doc. How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
Then put her out of her misery.<eos> How do you know so much about it?<eos> Because I've been on both sides of that phone.<eos> I've ducked my share of calls...<eos> And you boiled your share of bunnies?<eos> No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two.<eos> I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
5:30 a.m.<eos> Manhattan.<eos> BMT Nassau Street Line.<eos> Delancey Street and Bowery.<eos> Of course.<eos> That station's been abandoned for years.<eos> I'll call FBI S.W.A.T. New York.<eos> I'll be handling Kirk on my own, Harold.<eos> If you expect us to stand down...<eos> I do.
I did try knocking, like, a lot, but you didn't answer.<eos> And this is kind of important.<eos> Okay, well, you're here, so... what's up?<eos> I want you and Jesse to bond.<eos> Okay?<eos> If you're ever gonna get comfortable with this situation...<eos> No, I don't have time.<eos> - Then just listen.<eos> - I don't have time.<eos> No, none of us do.
She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.

So, you're telling me the hostages, this attack, the bio weapons, the First Lady is all for computer drives?<eos> Those drives contain decades worth of intelligence gathered through surveillance systems the leaders were here to dismantle.<eos> Classified intercepts, clandestine operations, millions of e-mails, text messages.<eos> You want to get to them before the terrorists do.<eos> The terrorists already have them.<eos> They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
No!<eos> Harry!<eos> Dayana!<eos> So, that's why you were late this morning.<eos> That's what you've been doing the whole week.<eos> Sleeping with the man who could get you fired.<eos> Why?<eos> Why compromise the entire mission for sex?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I don't.
She's right.<eos> She's an ass, but she's right.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> She's gonna be okay, right?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I think you'll have your secret weapon locked and loaded before the regionals.<eos> Dr. Webber, do you think I would push her to get surgery for some silly tournament?<eos> She's tried to drop out of the team six times, and that team is the only thing that keeps the lot of us from sitting around, watching TV in the common room, and moldering away like all the other old, wet sponges.<eos> She needs to stay in the game.<eos> We all do.
I have let it go.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I mean, you don't...<eos> All day, it's been... Can we just set a reset button and move forward?<eos> I am moving forward...<eos> by myself, apparently, because you can't be bothered to sleep at home.<eos> I've had patients.<eos> Every night for the past two weeks?<eos> - You didn't have to stay here.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Okay. So, now I know.<eos> No hanging out on Sundays during football season. - I got it.<eos> - But it's not just about football.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. So, growing up, I used to watch the Steelers with my dad.<eos> Every single Sunday, until I grew up and...<eos> It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship when they played the Broncos.<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Anyway, I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.<eos> And I did.
Some people think the scariest part is coming to the hospital to have the baby. Nah.<eos> The scariest part is leaving the hospital with the baby.<eos> Babies.<eos> Babies, of course.<eos> Doc, these two, they only fall asleep if they're next to each other.<eos> Is that unusual?<eos> Well, they've been sharing the same hot tub the last nine months; you can't bust them up right away.<eos> No, I'm not concerned.<eos> Did she tell you what we named them?<eos> No, actually, she didn't.
Um... yeah.<eos> That was... that was-- God bless her, that was my mom.<eos> Ah, wonderful woman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a good talk with her at the hospital.<eos> Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> You know, but I'm also a realist, and I understand there's a possibility that she doesn't wake up.<eos> Or what if she does...
Yeah, you know, I'm, um... journeying.<eos> - So, um...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What should we do until the museum closes?<eos> Busted.<eos> You're not the first couple to go for a home run in that locker.<eos> I'm gonna have to take you in.<eos> No, come on, mate.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> I don't?
- You can't. Stop!<eos> The only people we can help now is ourselves.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> We can't get out of here.<eos> We can't sit in here.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> We should go out and find help.<eos> If you want to leave, so be it.<eos> I'd rather not be trapped in here with fools.<eos> Don't do it, dude.
I feel so used.<eos> Am I just a piece of meat to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, put on a smile, Pork Chop.<eos> So what are you planning for the heist?<eos> The only thing I'm planning is getting my work done.<eos> Sure, you are.<eos> Come clean, or we'll tell everybody about your mistress.<eos> I don't have a mistress.<eos> You don't?
Wait, what's going on?<eos> He's unconscious!<eos> Let him hear your voice.<eos> Walter!<eos> Remember, you promised to come back to the garage with me!<eos> Walter!<eos> It's no use.<eos> He's out.<eos> All right, so if he's out cold, how we gonna get the oxygen to him?<eos> We don't.
I had jump training in the Corps, and this plane is already chasing after the capsule.<eos> It's the only hope he's got.<eos> Elia, you got to have emergency chutes on this rig.<eos> Back closet, on the top.<eos> All right.<eos> Timing has to be perfect.<eos> Sly?<eos> Do you have any idea how many variables need to be computed in order to make Cabe and Walter intersect?<eos> No!<eos> But you do.
They never found them.<eos> Then it froze over that winter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Appreciate your help.<eos> That was the quietest car ride we've ever had.<eos> I can't stop thinking about that guy, you know?<eos> I don't know what I would have done if I was him.<eos> All that guilt.<eos> How do you deal with that?<eos> He obviously never did.
- He is to us.<eos> Your prisoner's in the end stages of aplastic anemia.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> An average person has between 150 to 400,000 platelets per microliter of blood.<eos> Mr. Kirk's is under 10,000.<eos> I'd expect to see intracranial bleeding within hours.<eos> Treatment?<eos> He's been receiving transfusions for many years.<eos> If I give him another at this point, he's liable to suffer autoimmune shock.<eos> - And if you don't?
What don't I get? You don't live in my world, okay? !<eos> - Your life's perfect! - What do you...<eos> You have no idea.<eos> What are you talking about, Andy?<eos> You don't have a monopoly on pain, man.<eos> My father left me at a fire station the day I was born.<eos> He just took off.<eos> But this year, Andy, this year I found him.<eos> It took me 36 years, but I found him, and I forgave him.<eos> And my mother... She did some things, too.
Dismissed.<eos> And the bull-dicky just keeps piling on.<eos> So now I'm learning that they make lieutenants go through "sensitivity training."<eos> Why do you want this anyway?<eos> 'Cause I always thought I was supposed to.<eos> And 'cause I'm an idiot.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Christopher Herrmann.<eos> He does?
Um, I'm gonna get us some extra sheets.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna finish the report.<eos> Hey, how's Matt doing?<eos> - He's fine. - Why?<eos> Seems like he took that little boy's death hard.<eos> Sorry, what are we talking about?<eos> The little boy, from the warehouse accident. He didn't make it.<eos> Matt came by and brought some "get well" flowers, but the kid was gone.<eos> I figured he told you.<eos> N... no. He didn't.
Ah, behold the power of non-biodegradable polyethylene.<eos> Bit of a future environmental catastrophe, but, today, it could save our asses.<eos> - How's that gonna work?<eos> - Connor will fly to this spot with a team of archaeologists and dig this up.<eos> We're standing in what's going to be a suburb of Pittsburgh.<eos> I mean, who knows what could happen to this patch of land over 260 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know. No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
The middle of Fallujah would be an amazing result right now.<eos> Needless to say, it is very complicated, and we need Jiya and Mason to help us land.<eos> That is, provided they got my note.<eos> Let's say they didn't.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
Um, maybe... Well, I don't know.<eos> Would you like to call me Nana?<eos> Or maybe together we could come up with something cute.<eos> I'll think about that.<eos> You know who you look like?<eos> Me.<eos> Do people ever say that to you?<eos> That you look like a young Chris MacNeil?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Well, you do.
I was angry.<eos> I called my dad, told him everything.<eos> Said I could solve the whole thing with a pair of scissors and a trip to Bennett's storage shed.<eos> I'm guessing that's why he tried to take the blame.<eos> He realized I'd really done it.<eos> The night of the jump, something changed.<eos> I didn't want Bennett to die.<eos> I tried to get him to call off the jump.<eos> But he wouldn't listen.<eos> He never did.
Okay, well, do you know what would happen to you if a parole officer knew that you were hanging out with Tall Boy?<eos> Tall Boy is not your problem.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Not no more.<eos> Okay, but you asked me for my help.<eos> And now I know better.<eos> You can't help me.<eos> Really?<eos> You think you know everything.<eos> You don't.
You don't want this, George.<eos> Put the gun down. Let's talk.<eos> It was an accident, I swear.<eos> I know.<eos> You were scared.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> George, it's not.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
I know how we can get that tape back.<eos> We go in as FBI.<eos> And what, we just show up following up a tattoo case?<eos> You have a better idea?<eos> - Yeah, the truth. - No!<eos> We can do this.<eos> NYPD's gonna start upstairs with the body, They got no reason to look in the VCR.<eos> We can put the tape back in the closet before anybody notices it's missing.<eos> We just have to wait until they make it an official crime scene.<eos> What do we do until then?
I wouldn't say "gun aficionado"" 'cause an aficionado, to me, refers to, like, people who collect cars, and cigars and fine wine.<eos> Gun nuts are gun nuts. Let's call them what they are.<eos> They're gun nuts.<eos> That's being nice.<eos> And now that you're the arbiter of fine living?<eos> Is that, is that right?<eos> Hey, whatever. I respectfully disagree.<eos> - Okay? - So, Norm. Mm-hmm.<eos> He give you any names that maybe we should get in contact with?<eos> He did.
Listen, Raimes, I appreciate the help, but just... why don't you just let your parents be the parents, all right?<eos> I got to handle it.<eos> Hey, I got to go.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Come in.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> What's up?<eos> Roommate not home?<eos> Look, you don't got to worry about Miracella anymore, all right?<eos> But you do.
Yeah, I can have a look.<eos> We appreciate that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> This is the, uh, third time in two years you've tried to hurt yourself.<eos> You want to talk about why you're back in here?<eos> You know, we can't help you unless you decide to help yourself.<eos> You people can't help me.<eos> You'll only make it worse.<eos> You always do.
But I'd be lying if I said there weren't times when I thought about... what my life could've been if had taken a different path.<eos> But anytime I'm with Raimy, even the hard times, I'm so grateful for the life that I have.<eos> I'm so grateful for her.<eos> Me too.<eos> I think I thought when, uh... when I went undercover, you know, it's gonna mean another promotion, more money.<eos> I thought it was best for her, you know?<eos> For all of us.<eos> Somewhere along the way, I... it became what was best for me.<eos> I-I don't think I wanted to admit it, but I changed.<eos> We both did.
The FBI just handed in their report, and it concludes that Jason Atwood did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on as a White House correspondent to keep us honest.<eos> She kept up her end of the bargain.<eos> We need to do the same.<eos> Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
I need to see for myself what's happening in Houston, and, you know, talk to the doctors, try to figure out what's next.<eos> As you should.<eos> Listen, we'll be fine.<eos> You take as long as you need.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have one condition.<eos> I need you to check in every day, no matter what.<eos> I need to know you're ok.<eos> It's understood.<eos> I don't...
Law school, the D.A.'s office.<eos> That was all your idea.<eos> What you thought was best for me.<eos> It was just... just time I went out on my own.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> You ended up working for him.<eos> My ex-husband.<eos> Do you think it was just a coincidence that he offered you the job right after we got divorced?<eos> He wanted to win.<eos> And he did.
It's not just enough to know that an asteroid is there.<eos> We need to know which ones are the big ones.<eos> So that, what, Bruce Willis can go nuke it?<eos> Surprisingly, yes.<eos> We've been reading up on this stuff today-- there are proposals in the works to send rockets to asteroids, to nudge them or even blow them up.<eos> So was Cole right?<eos> Are we measuring them wrong?<eos> No idea.<eos> Do we have any idea why a Wall Street guy was studying this stuff in the first place?<eos> We don't.
Ask me no questions, Ma, I'll tell you no lies.<eos> What is it, Bill?<eos> Do you remember Jane up at View Park?<eos> Got on at me, got on at me to make the fence stronger around about the hen house.<eos> Yes. Me being too busy, and then of course the fox getting amongst the hens and she wouldn't speak to me for a week...<eos> You can't build a fence around every house in the country, Bill.<eos> I know.<eos> If, heaven forbid, that monster does strike again, you will catch him.<eos> They will put him away for years.<eos> What if this time he does something worse?
It's okay.<eos> Look, Commander, our son's been through a lot today.<eos> Of course.<eos> You guys should go home, get some rest.<eos> I'll show them out.<eos> Folks, this way.<eos> How's the kid holding up?<eos> He's pretty shaken.<eos> Tell me you got something.<eos> Yeah. I do.
How deep down the rabbit hole are you?<eos> I'm the Mad Hatter, Danny.<eos> I'm in Wonderland.<eos> She's the perfect client.<eos> The hospital won't press charges.<eos> Too many people worshipping at the altar of the Angel of Sacred Heart.<eos> Who would besmirch an angel?<eos> It's blasphemy.<eos> The hospital wants her hemophilia B cure.<eos> A lot of hospitals do...
Callisto is a litigation speed trap.<eos> They've made a cottage industry out of patent cases.<eos> - How? - Well, the jury always sides with the plaintiffs, and they hand out the biggest cash verdicts in all the country.<eos> These plaintiffs, they hire the local law firm. And the juries well, they know, and they like these local lawyers.<eos> And so, if they represent the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs must be right.<eos> That sounds wildly unfair.<eos> It's called the Halo Effect.<eos> Juries apply their love of local lawyers to whoever they represent.<eos> So how did you beat them the last time?<eos> I didn't.
She's a liar.<eos> To broken wings.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> I'm not allowed to talk about my sister and Windemere's research project. It's all... it's all confidential.<eos> Under a nondisclosure agreement.<eos> You were a kid.<eos> You signed a binding legal document?<eos> - Benny, easy.<eos> - No, that man promised me he would find a cure for my sister.<eos> And he didn't.
Your, your suit, claims that you patented all the elements contained in Ms. Ketchum's product.<eos> Is-is that right?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> You had all the pieces, but you haven't put them together this way yet?<eos> That's a simplified way of expressing it, but yes.<eos> Like you had a-a-a toaster and a clock, and hadn't squished 'em into one.<eos> Sure.<eos> If that helps you.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> It-it kind of does.
All right. All right, okay. Wait until you see what I got planned next.<eos> Hello?<eos> Let's just leave the money on the counter.<eos> Yeah, but I-I don't have any change.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, we just want to pay for the...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Hello?<eos> How you girls doing?
Okay, got him.<eos> Jankowski is outside the Moonbrite Motel on Wells Avenue in D.C. Thanks, Abbs.<eos> All right.<eos> The winner of the best apartment of anyone we know is...<eos> Torres.<eos> What?<eos> ! Who the heck is Torres?<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I ran from you guys.<eos> But do I look like the kind of person that would shoot someone?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Get him up.<eos> Give me the contract.<eos> If you give me a minute to check the contract, I'll take you through the terms.<eos> Contracts?<eos> I don't get involved in anything without a legally-binding contract.<eos> See what you can do for Burton.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> It was two white kids.<eos> She didn't mean it.<eos> They never do.
No, but...<eos> Then why are you calling me?<eos> And why are you still standing there?<eos> - Go break up with...<eos> - Scott? Look, I know things haven't been great with us, but I have to ask you a favor.<eos> - Oh. - Sorry.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> You don't have to act like you care.<eos> No, but I do.
_<eos> _<eos> I got to say, you put on one hell of an act.<eos> Did you really think you could go on national television and no one would dig into your story?<eos> I know about you and Miguel Ortiz.<eos> Your daughter worked? She made the money so you wouldn't have to?<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> I swear, I don't know what happened to her.<eos> - I don't know who took her.<eos> - I do.
You know he still doesn't talk to his sister because of her toast?<eos> That was rough.<eos> Anyway, what's your poison?<eos> I got a full bar.<eos> I'm easy. Whatever you're having.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Now, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Listen, I am not here trying to cause any problems.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how you knew Sarah Keaton.<eos> I don't.
What's that?<eos> The day Sarah was murdered, you told me that she called you.<eos> Sarah called me.<eos> She told me to come over here.<eos> Just... get over here, okay?<eos> Now. And I just... for the life of me can't figure out why she would've done that.<eos> I mean, you guys were having marital problems.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Well, my point is that Sarah never called you.<eos> But someone did. Her brother.
You're gonna have my back today, right?<eos> I-I don't know what you mean.<eos> Look, listen.<eos> I'm all for diversity.<eos> I think it's great.<eos> This whole international thing you're doing here. But...<eos> I don't want a kidney from just anyone.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> You sound winded.<eos> You just go for a run?<eos> No, I...<eos> I slept in.<eos> - Did you take my advice?<eos> - What advice?<eos> You know, about living your life.<eos> Are you asking me if I have a guy here? I don't know.<eos> Do you?
Uh, a little bit, yeah.<eos> Okay, we're sort of racing to the end here.<eos> And with that, I shall step slightly out of range.<eos> All right, I'm just gonna take a quick swim.<eos> Oh, my God! Where are the stairs?<eos> There's no stairs!<eos> I'm never gonna make it!<eos> You were standing earlier in the day next to the car that hit my wife.<eos> I would soon return to New York a changed man, because, for me, that will always be the summer that I finally put my head underwater.<eos> I did it!
It's been hemorrhaging money for years now.<eos> The congregation has shrunk.<eos> Father, we've been growing recently. I...<eos> I can't abandon my parish.<eos> Your parishioners will be absorbed into nearby congregations.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> Tomas, St. Anthony's will be shuttered, whether you accept this promotion or not.<eos> And, believe me, it is a promotion.<eos> You don't want me here.<eos> Of course we do.
Yes. It's very romantic, waiting for his body to heal before I destroy his soul.<eos> Cling, clung, I got a robot dong.<eos> I got a robot dong goes cling, cling, cling...<eos> - You got to love Robby.<eos> - He's been singing that a lot.<eos> - Hmm? You've done a great job, but I'm gonna have to demote you.<eos> - Shouldn't be a manager, because you should be a manager.<eos> Are you just saying words in no particular order?<eos> We asked Donovan to bring in a couple of his "hottest friends."<eos> And he sure did.
Clear?<eos> Ampicillin.<eos> Atticus's quarterly software update caused an error in one of the arm's calibrations.<eos> It wasn't much.<eos> Less than 100 nanometers off of what Robeson commanded.<eos> But impossible for the human eye to detect.<eos> It was already a bloody surgery, making it difficult to see clearly.<eos> But when Robeson commanded Atticus to cut into one of the hard-to-reach fibroids, it nicked one of Erica's blood vessels.<eos> Terry didn't make a mistake.<eos> Atticus did.
I did.<eos> I offered him to wait in here, but he claimed to prefer the stoop.<eos> I don't think he likes me.<eos> I have a feeling it has more to do with the... pervert family tree.<eos> So, did you get everything you needed at TrueRomantix?<eos> Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
Well, tradesmen need to be taught their trades.<eos> And finding a willing teacher might be just as difficult as finding a willing employer.<eos> Well, I thought I could be his teacher.<eos> I mean, what we do is a trade, right?<eos> You want to teach him to be a detective?<eos> We've done it before.<eos> You're referring to Kitty.<eos> Kitty, who never graduated, burned a man's face off and fled the country.<eos> She had a lot of baggage.<eos> He doesn't?
At Mossy Green Realty.<eos> Jason Bull.<eos> Hi.<eos> Benny Colón.<eos> Jason Bull. Wow.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would remember that smile anywhere.<eos> I-I used to be Joyce Devlin.<eos> You probably wouldn't remember me.<eos> Of course I do, Joyce.
And you're not an exorcist.<eos> Do you remember what I told you?<eos> That I had too much to lose.<eos> Yeah, and then what happened?<eos> You lost the Rance girl, you lost the love of your life, you betrayed everything you held dear and for what?<eos> What did it get you?<eos> You're gonna die in here.<eos> Unless you wake up right now.<eos> But I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm not a liar.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You lied about Jessica, you lied about hearing God's voice... that was a personal favorite.<eos> "Look at this family.<eos> See how they are suffering."<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did. The first Mexican Pope.
Get him, Robby.<eos> You-you tried to make Jess the seventh woman you're dating, and you don't even know the first thing about her.<eos> I mean, did-did you know that when she was six she tried to eat a lightning bug so that her heart would glow like E.T.?<eos> Did you know that she tried to give herself Lyme disease out of solidarity to her fourth grade classmate?<eos> Or-or that she never lets any of her electronics go below 25%, just in case someone else needs to use them?<eos> I mean, did you know... did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?<eos> It's so cute, man.<eos> It would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess...<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you don't.
Have you successfully changed everything about yourself as planned?<eos> Oh, yeah, you wouldn't recognize me.<eos> I'm wearing a sweater, I bought new shoes,<eos> I put something on my face called "moisturizer."<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> - Did you clean your car?<eos> I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part:<eos> I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.<eos> Who has a favorite font?<eos> The Santiagos do.
What is that strange book you're holding?<eos> I've never seen it before.<eos> "Jake Peralta's Guide to Tricking Amy's Dad."<eos> What?<eos> Who put that there?<eos> Why did I use a title page?<eos> Relax, Jake, it's okay.<eos> Actually, I'm quite impressed.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Yeah, you did a ton of research here.
It's all about work.<eos> So I hacked her calendar, and I found out she has an appointment at 7:30.<eos> Tonight.<eos> In blue.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Work appointments are in Cybermart green, and personal appointments are in blue.<eos> It's a blue!<eos> It's a personal!<eos> She's going on a date.<eos> What do I do?
You arrange for a ship, for sailors.<eos> You just make sure my son gets home safely.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And... In return?<eos> I will tell my son ivar to tell his brothers that you did everything you could to save me.<eos> That you and I, we are sworn friends and that king aelle was solely responsible for my death.<eos> That way, when my sons come back... And they will... They will spare you, my friend...<eos> And they will take out all of their revenge on king aelle.<eos> Then do it.
Oh, is that true?<eos> Is that really true?<eos> So, do I just wash my hands of him?<eos> Like Pontius Pilate?<eos> Well, I have no doubt Aelle will enjoy the sight of your death.<eos> I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the Gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.

I'm fine.<eos> Where you been?<eos> At home.<eos> Playing cornhole.<eos> Melissa, you've been gone for two days now.<eos> Don't leave, I'm in the elevator!<eos> Where's my bullets?<eos> Where'd I put 'em?<eos> Well, why were you shooting off your gun?<eos> I didn't.
Please, sit.<eos> Can I get you a drink?<eos> It's a little bit early for us.<eos> Aw, this used to be more fun.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry for all the theatrics, but meeting with this young man in public has proved detrimental to one's health lately.<eos> So Susie contacted you?<eos> We never met in person, but somehow she got the word that I was the man to see about decoding an encrypted message from 1963.<eos> Breaking old ciphers is something of a hobby of mine.<eos> Well, I politely declined, hoping she would drop the investigation.<eos> She obviously didn't.
That's probably enough about my fashion choices.<eos> I take it we wouldn't want a detective on our jury.<eos> No.<eos> On this one we need people who only think of the big picture.<eos> Intuitive thinkers.<eos> Jury selection is never perfect.<eos> That's why we have a head start.<eos> This is tomorrow's jury pool.<eos> How did you get... I mean, nobody gets this in advance.<eos> We do.
you were getting out Of your car to go pee.<eos> - No!<eos> There was a spider in the car, and I panicked.<eos> - Damn it, how did I not guess that?<eos> - You gotta see this spider.<eos> It's gigantic.<eos> Charles, this is amazing.<eos> - I know, when's the last time you cried like that?<eos> You cried?<eos> - Damn right, I did.
We'll wait.<eos> 'Cause we've got all...<eos> Night...<eos> Long.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but...<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
- I'm being set up!<eos> - So you're saying your car wasn't<eos> - at Heather's house? - No, it was. I played in that band for two years.<eos> I earned first chair.<eos> We can see him, but he can't see us.<eos> I kind of need your help here.<eos> Okay, do you...<eos> do you recognize him? Look close, okay?<eos> Why did you break into her house?<eos> I didn't.
- Huh?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Recently there have been accidents near Tunnel construction site.<eos> Explosions have caused dangerous things to happen such as collapsed pigsties or flying stones.<eos> So keep away from the site. That out-of-body experience on her blog. I did it.<eos> - Go to hell. - Don't lie.<eos> Really!<eos> When I opened my eyes, I saw myself sleeping.<eos> Then what did you do?
We're not investigating the fraud case.<eos> Well, maybe we should be.<eos> Nina told me that there's an internal memo that proves that the person who actually committed fraud is Earl's boss, Sean Rasmullen.<eos> No memo like that was introduced at trial.<eos> Probably because it didn't exist.<eos> There's no proof that memo wasn't just made up.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Nina kept a copy.<eos> Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?<eos> She did.
We did it.<eos> We got Earl a reprieve.<eos> We have time to figure out the truth now.<eos> - We did it. - We did!<eos> You and me!<eos> We're awesome!<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why aren't we really?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
It was a couple of weeks ago.<eos> He was older than me.<eos> 20s, maybe.<eos> He was in real bad shape.<eos> Shaking, sweating.<eos> Hunched over, like he had a stomachache.<eos> I just thought he was sick.<eos> So now you're wondering if this was an addict who was in withdrawal?<eos> Well, Dr. Krieg told him to leave.<eos> And he did.
"You really need to pay ransoms, because I want my uncle and aunt back."<eos> If you love somebody, you'd do anything you can.<eos> [Collett on recording] Hello?<eos> - [Ali on recording] Hello.<eos> - Hello, Ali?<eos> You cut the line on me again yesterday.<eos> Hello?<eos> [narrating] This became a 24-hour job.<eos> If Ali wanted to answer, he would.<eos> If he didn't, he didn't.
Haven't the foggiest.<eos> It could be anywhere.<eos> Great Gronka Morka!<eos> What is the gnome doing in this dollhouse?<eos> Toby-pie?<eos> I don't recognize that voice.<eos> Who is that?<eos> It's a friend, Nana!<eos> I do have more than one!<eos> No, you don't.
- Does that make sense?<eos> - Is it supposed to?<eos> Nah.<eos> That's why it's called algebra.<eos> Hey, thanks again for this.<eos> I-I feel...<eos> I feel really bad about what's happening with the play.<eos> I know it means a lot to you.<eos> You know, I was super mad at you, but then, I realized you've got a lot more going on than people think.<eos> - I do.
- Is it supposed to?<eos> Nah.<eos> That's why it's called algebra.<eos> Hey, thanks again for this.<eos> I-I feel...<eos> I feel really bad about what's happening with the play.<eos> I know it means a lot to you.<eos> You know, I was super mad at you, but then, I realized you've got a lot more going on than people think.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do?
If need be.<eos> Well, need not be!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I am better than fine.<eos> And if you want the Grit-Shaka, you're gonna have to take it from me.<eos> Come on, Jimbo.<eos> We don't have to go there.<eos> For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command!<eos> Holla!<eos> Or maybe we do.
Go Moles!<eos> Go, Moles.<eos> Before we begin, I have a few announcements.<eos> And his eye is glowing.<eos> And then, the dream just keeps reminding me that I'm completely way out of my league.<eos> Right? Tobes.<eos> Who is that masked mole?<eos> You ever wonder?<eos> You didn't hear a word I said just then, did you?<eos> Sure, I did.
- You bring news?<eos> - They're going to Gatto's Keep.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> I wasn't close enough to see, but they seek one of his treasures.<eos> I know of Gatto.<eos> If the hunter is foolish enough to deal with him, I doubt they will return.<eos> Did you bring the charm I require?<eos> Do you know what to do with it?<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Of course I do.
I think my stomach is trying to communicate with me.<eos> That ain't your stomach, pal.<eos> After eating a buffet like that, that fleshy inner tube of a body is about to spring a leak.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> How can you function with only two eyes?<eos> Ooh! You didn't happen to overhear who Strickler brought back with him, did you?<eos> Some troll with big horns and a weird staff, maybe?<eos> - Sorry, I do not know.<eos> - Yeah, well, neither do we.
Eli's gone.<eos> Looks like it's just you and me now, buttsnack!<eos> I really do not like the decaf.<eos> Guys, guys!<eos> There's a fight outside!<eos> Come on!<eos> - What in the heck is going on? - Kids today.<eos> - Steve, stop this!<eos> - Why couldn't you let me win this?<eos> - But then you never do, do you?
I need to call 911, though.<eos> Let me see your goddamn hands!<eos> Get your hands in the air!<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> What, are you gonna shoot everybody? - What the hell is happening?<eos> - Who the hell knows?<eos> - Quick, let's go.<eos> - Don't use your cell phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They did.
Happy hour start yet?<eos> Ooh, company.<eos> You're cute. You're cute.<eos> You, sir, are very cute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you, my love, are to die for.<eos> No phoners come through here.<eos> Phoners don't like English food.<eos> English people don't like English food.<eos> - Hey, I do, mister.
No.<eos> They must have had some kind of aircraft.<eos> How'd they find us?<eos> Who cares? We have to get her back.<eos> Where are they taking her?<eos> The school.<eos> No.<eos> We have to go back there.<eos> We don't even know where that is.<eos> Jeb did.
When I saw jora, he had the same cuts and marks as this child.<eos> Whoever killed this little boy, killed alexei's child, too.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Just have to prove it.<eos> I must.<eos> I have to.<eos> I have to prove it.<eos> Leo, do you know what people get around here when they demand the truth?<eos> Do you?
Then take the weight that comes with it.<eos> Alexei, tell me why Leo was arrested.<eos> See, the bosses believe that he was working for the west, but I believe he was working on this.<eos> Series of child murders, you see?<eos> Your son, may he rest in peace, he was murdered, yes?<eos> No.<eos> He was killed in an accident.<eos> But at first you believed he was murdered, right?<eos> Sit down.<eos> At first, yes, I did.
We'd have to wear masks.<eos> If I lose to Candy now, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear to God.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> You're connected, Nell.<eos> And now is the time for us to call upon those contacts, those creatures of the political underbelly that make things happen.<eos> So, what do you want? You want to take a hit out on Rivera?<eos> Oh, God damn it, you people drive me crazy.<eos> You pretend like you're this normal person, this lovable mother, this working wife and shit, and that's what makes you so dangerous.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about. - Of course you do.<eos> Of course you do.
You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> I saw Castillo.<eos> - Hmm. Yeah.<eos> - He was talking to the IMF.<eos> I heard.<eos> He said a referendum.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - He promised.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did.
They are trapped and they are desperate.<eos> And your daughter is their ticket out of this purgatory.<eos> What do they want with her?<eos> They want her to be their lantern in the darkness.<eos> To lead them into the light.<eos> What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
He didn't laugh at any of my jokes, but I felt like there was something there.<eos> I don't know. Not like I even care.<eos> It's like, whatever. I should listen to my psychic.<eos> She says, "stop dating losers, and never go on a plane."<eos> I knew it.<eos> Oh, so you think he's playing hard to get?<eos> Or the more likely scenario:<eos> He lost his phone in, like, a fire.<eos> Yeah, I think he lost his phone.<eos> I do too.
Can you pass the salt?<eos> I was thinking about what you said about how I'm not using the f-word properly.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What'd you come up with?<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Fuck is a great word.<eos> Fuck is a great word.<eos> Fuck... Ahh!<eos> Oh, man, that don't look good at all.<eos> No, it don't.
- Oh.<eos> No kidding, they're called books? - Yeah, they're like TV for smart people.<eos> See, what we're talking about here, Katz, is time.<eos> Geologic time.<eos> Hundreds of thousands of years of enormous, shifting tectonic plates.<eos> It's like the world being reborn from below while it's being eroded from above.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, when we get back I'm gonna buy you a TV.<eos> Because nobody gives a fuck about shifting tectonic plates.<eos> Well, I do.
- Right side clear.<eos> Room clear!<eos> - Whoa! - Do you live here, sir?<eos> - Do you live here?<eos> - This is my studio.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No...<eos> No one does.
I don't know the model.<eos> T-1000.<eos> Liquid metal.<eos> Shape-changer. It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You can do this.<eos> A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
and that you would understand.<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> That thing won't hold him for long.<eos> Come on!<eos> Reese!<eos> Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
I said no.<eos> That part was actually a lie, obviously.<eos> Obviously.<eos> So, what did they want to know about Stevie and I?<eos> If I'd seen you commit any crimes.<eos> And drugs. They think you're selling a lot of drugs.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And what did you tell them?<eos> That you didn't.
A new married couple tolerate each other, Mr. Melville, but a new married couple can also bring down a ship.<eos> - You married, Mr. Melville?<eos> - I am.<eos> The Lord have mercy on ya.<eos> First child on the way, too.<eos> So, does your good wife know that you brought all you have in the world here tonight, and givin' it to a stranger?<eos> - No, Sir.<eos> - You're full of surprises, aren't you?<eos> So... the Essex did not return to port.<eos> - She did not.
Jerry, you're my friend, but Compton?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Queens, maybe.<eos> Listen, if you find the next Bon Jovi, call me, okay?<eos> - Good luck. - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Sure thing. - Yeah. Somebody say "Do that shit Do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it<eos> Say, "Do that shit, do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it Say, "Do that shit, do that shit, do it"<eos> Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Hey, don't even worry about it.<eos> It was just a thought.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Oh, whoa, whoa! Really? Good night?<eos> You okay to drive? No.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Good night, Andre. Nah.<eos> See, I can't help thinking, maybe you want me to come inside.<eos> Of course I do.
All right.<eos> Shit! It's 'cause you ain't got them damn gloves on.<eos> Man, whatever. But I hear you.<eos> Ar'ight. These invoices haven't been paid.<eos> They're two or three years outdated.<eos> These are cancelled checks.<eos> They all bounced. And these are past due.<eos> Jerry took advantage of you.<eos> I know it's a lot, but you had to know the truth sometime.<eos> Now you do.
What happened?<eos> Did we abort?<eos> Uh...<eos> God damn it.<eos> Johnny?<eos> Guys, can you hear me?<eos> I made it.<eos> Ben, look at this place.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We did it.
Move, let's move!<eos> Move your ass, Reed!<eos> Move it! Keep moving!<eos> Oh, my God. Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> Reed, let's go!<eos> Reed, come on!<eos> The re-entry's not working!<eos> I don't know what to do!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Reed! Do something!
He works for the government.<eos> Okay. But they didn't see us.<eos> It's 10, 15 years in jail.<eos> What if they woke up?<eos> Look, they didn't see...<eos> They had a kid!<eos> We're fine. We're totally fine. What if one of the neighbors saw my license plate?<eos> No one saw you.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> - They didn't.
Still, they definitely know we're here.<eos> No, it's a fly-over. They would've flown down on us.<eos> We're fine.<eos> They do it all the time.<eos> It's right over that ridge.<eos> There it is.<eos> Look. We fucking did it.<eos> - I told you we could do it.<eos> - We made it.<eos> We did it. We fucking did it.
I WAS, LIKE, CRAZY BACK THEN.<eos> I WAS COMPLETELY IMMATURE AND ACTING OUT<eos> AND JUST REALLY, LIKE, FREE WITH MY BODY,<eos> AND THAT'S JUST NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE.<eos> THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.<eos> WELL... WE'RE PRETTY FREE WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> BUT, Y-YOU HAVE TO ADMIT I-I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN...<eos> LIKE, LESS FREE WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> BUT WE HAVE SEX EVERY WEEK WITH OUR BODIES.<eos> WE DO.
No, no. We thought your daughter was a boy.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, what he means is that<eos> Dylan told us that a fourth grader was picking on him, but he didn't tell us it was a girl.<eos> Yeah, and if you had, we'd have told you it's never okay to hit a girl.<eos> And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
There are various levels of usefulness and quality, but this is the most pure and most valuable solution made by the House of Abrasax.<eos> Kalique came out of a bath...<eos> Naturally, my sister didn't explain what it is or where it comes from.<eos> It comes from people.<eos> Each unit is refined from approximately a hundred human beings.<eos> What?<eos> Your planet is a farm Jupiter.<eos> There are thousands of planets like yours set up by families like mine to supply an ever increasing demand for more time.<eos> Are you saying you killed a hundred people to make this?<eos> Not me, but yes, someone did.
You're all right.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> My family?<eos> They're safe.<eos> Medic!<eos> We can't hold much longer.<eos> Set a portal.<eos> Now.<eos> I don't need to tell you how dangerous...<eos> Then don't!
The man who came to see me has an odor on his skin. A whiff of garlic that was not garlic.<eos> Arsenic.<eos> Anything else?<eos> And moldering crabapples.<eos> Thank you, Max.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Not in the habit.<eos> Not you. Him.<eos> So, all that made sense to you?<eos> It didn't to you?
I don't think you do, but I think you know someone who does.<eos> Uncle Rudi.<eos> I've also been told that your father was never... Actually a Nazi.<eos> He was forced to work for them.<eos> So I'm here to help him.<eos> - Why don't you help me.<eos> - With what?<eos> If I had 15 minutes, we'd drink tea, eat biscuits,<eos> I'd talk, you'd laugh, and we'd be on our way.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't.
They counted the prescribed 5 seconds before administering 750 volts of electricity.<eos> How is she?<eos> We've just run a series of tests and don't see any long term damage.<eos> It's quite remarkable, in fact.<eos> Is she awake?<eos> Can I go see her?<eos> She's exhausted but you might be able to get in a few words.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> I know why you ran away.<eos> You do?
Listen, I can't talk right now.<eos> Go right ahead, we're not doing anything important.<eos> Just your run of the mill double homicide investigation.<eos> Shut up, I can't hear.<eos> Maybe I should get out of the car, give you some privacy.<eos> When?<eos> Can I call you later?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> You got a date?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You do good.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I know I'm the type of guy who scares you.<eos> I'm a big, loud, gay Jew.<eos> You don't scare me.<eos> Laurel Hester gave the citizens of Ocean County justice for 23 years, and now she's asking you to give her justice in return!<eos> - You have the power!<eos> - We don't have that option.<eos> You do!
I'm straight, by the way.<eos> I also happen to be Laurel Hester's partner on the force.<eos> We've worked together for many, many years now and I can tell you from firsthand experience that she is about as fine an officer as Ocean County could hope to have.<eos> Now, Laurel, Stacie, and I could solve this problem real quick, okay?<eos> I could go get a justice of the peace, take them to Laurel, and we could get married.<eos> And then when she dies, I'd get her pension, no questions asked.<eos> I could pass it along to Stacie, no problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical hard ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system, or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
There you are.<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> Hello, my strangely orange vegetable friend.<eos> A quick snip for you.<eos> Ah, lovely!<eos> Ooh, heavy pumpkin!<eos> Look out, mices!<eos> Oh, well. Never mind.<eos> Let's do it here.<eos> Do what here?
I got him trapped.<eos> He just doesn't know it yet.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> 'Cause he has everything to lose.<eos> All I had was that boy.<eos> And he took him away from me.<eos> I can't let you go back out there.<eos> Not again.<eos> I ain't afraid to die anymore.<eos> I done it already.
I mean, not to me.<eos> I never went to a dance when I was a kid.<eos> - Kind of a nerd.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Arthur, heh, but, um, with all due respect, I'm...<eos> You're honored and thrilled to lend that Bianca Piper magic? You wanna do your thing and put some stuff in the words and make it pop?<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> "No, you didn't. I didn't say..."<eos> Yes, you did. And thank...<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.
Did any of these people know where they stood in the social hierarchy?<eos> Cool socks.<eos> Really dig them.<eos> I wanna make out with your face.<eos> Good, because my face wants you to make out with it.<eos> Socks?<eos> They...<eos> What the...?<eos> I never knew why I couldn't talk to Toby.<eos> Now I did.
I'm taking you off this movie.<eos> Dana Gordon is in charge now.<eos> We made a great movie that this idiot is trying to fuck up.<eos> This idiot's father owns half the fucking negative, and you know it.<eos> He can toss it in the garbage if he decides to.<eos> - You have the...<eos> - Dana has this covered.<eos> You stay the fuck out of it.<eos> Hey, John. You can't do this.<eos> Ari, I just did.
Bear. Rowan, O-K.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You sure you're OK?<eos> Mind moving from there?<eos> Makin' me nervous.<eos> So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.<eos> Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.<eos> 'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.<eos> - You remember.<eos> - Of course, I do.
Give me a slap then!<eos> Maybe you won't feel like such a coward!<eos> Owl - Bad parrot!<eos> No! Back In your cage.<eos> Be good!<eos> Cut!<eos> Super!<eos> - Good! It's good, Martin.<eos> - That can't work.<eos> No, it does work.
How are we getting on?<eos> We have about 40% of the film, all the French motifs are missing, and parts of some Czech scenes.<eos> The question is whether the French would mind if we added a new storyline.<eos> - Boys, forget the French.<eos> - Wait, what about the French co-producer?<eos> - There is none.<eos> - What do you mean there is none?<eos> I have the phone number for the French co-producer.<eos> - Leave it be.<eos> - But I do!
- Yeah?<eos> You sure you're ready to part ways with that?<eos> - Thought it'd make you happy.<eos> - Yeah, it did.<eos> You could give it to Jax.<eos> It belonged to my grandmother.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> You gave it to me the night after I overdosed.<eos> Remember you said it would protect me?<eos> I sure don't.
- Was it broken into?<eos> - No.<eos> It's just-- we're talking about--<eos> it's just impossible.<eos> We're talking about Carolyn.<eos> Um...<eos> There's a lot of-- stuff in the-- in the garage to pack.<eos> She made some beautiful things, didn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Surprise!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No way!<eos> You did this.<eos> You guys should know better, you know, you don't surprise a guy my age.<eos> You'll give me a heart attack.<eos> She looks like a young Jackie O.<eos> - I look absurd with her. - Yes, you do.<eos> We have to make her sign a prenup, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
- You're a good grandpa.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> - Thank you so much for... Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, now that the educational portion of the day is over, let's get to the fun stuff.<eos> What fun stuff? Like...<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> Right? - No, you said a day.<eos> Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Ten years ago I could not have pictured myself dragging my family the other side of the world to start over in some mid-management job.<eos> At least you're making a good living.<eos> And... doing good.<eos> I know the bill of goods those Cardiff boys sell you.<eos> You got something against clean drinking water?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Maybe I do need a shot.<eos> No, you don't. No, you don't.<eos> You got the kids upstairs.<eos> So what did you do, anyway? In your better days.
some scumbag killed my wife.<eos> What do you think you did...<eos> to be sitting here?<eos> - did your wife get killed?<eos> - Look, man, all due respect, you know,<eos> I haven't really gotten much sleep, man.<eos> - What are you try to ask me...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I don't fucking... I just told you...<eos> What did you do?
Yeah, she can't save you now.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Stick to the plan!<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> Stick to the plan!<eos> Tony Weeks... is caught between two monsters,<eos> - as they fire away... - What is he doing?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - What is he doing?<eos> What did he do to my dad?
- Hardly.<eos> All I know about you is that you grew six inches one month.<eos> Yeah, that hurt my knees.<eos> - Are you a stoner? - Not really.<eos> That was Lorelei's thing.<eos> Because it must have been so tough for her to get through the day with her mermaid hair and her gumdrop ass.<eos> Lay off her. You killed her.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> - You really cared about Lorelei?<eos> - Yeah, I did, actually.
Just let him be.<eos> Daddy told me about you, Deon about how you made me in a body that will die.<eos> What do you mean, Chappie?<eos> Is it true that I will die in a few days, Deon?<eos> That this battery will die?<eos> Is it true, Deon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you my maker.<eos> Why'd you just make me so I could die?<eos> I didn't...
Hey, buddy!<eos> Buddy!<eos> Come on up here!<eos> - We got a load of liberated champagne!<eos> - ELIZABETH:<eos> There's so many.<eos> - BURRIDGE:<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> How you doing, huh?
- Put it away. - Sure.<eos> I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> - Not on paper, not on tape, nothing. - Ok.<eos> In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you. So...<eos> Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's... things, you cannot tell me, but...<eos> I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
And the Church has a lot of friends.<eos> Like Eric Macleish?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's just say... he's not part of the solution.<eos> - You follow what I'm saying?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You work hard, Mr. Rezendes. Are you married?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And your wife doesn't mind you working all the time?<eos> Yeah, she does.
Don't you have a job to go to?<eos> It's my day of rest.<eos> Animals don't get sick on Sunday?<eos> It's the Lord's day.<eos> He's got them covered.<eos> Play nice, you two.<eos> I'm not playing anything. She can't mind her own business.<eos> Only because I care.<eos> You just have nothing better to do.<eos> -Yes, I do.
Fuck me! Oh... God.<eos> What if we use holy water? Huh.<eos> Shit!<eos> - I forgot about that.<eos> - I got a bottle of water.<eos> - It's gonna know, okay.<eos> - I can put it in a cup.<eos> - It's got to be blessed by a priest.<eos> - Not going to make a difference.<eos> - Not doing this without the holy water, guys.
My child.<eos> He cared more about those spoiled, pathetic drunks than his own flesh and blood.<eos> And you were his favorite, right up until you killed him.<eos> No, you made me do it.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> You're just like everyone else, Patrick.<eos> You don't give a fuck who hurts as long as it is not you.<eos> She's lying! Patrick! Patrick!<eos> Bitch deserved it.<eos> No, she didn't.
Where is that?<eos> That's us.<eos> That's the City Circle.<eos> It's at least 70, 75 blocks north.<eos> - Seventy-five blocks?<eos> - Uh-huh. Nobody knows we're alive.<eos> This is our chance.<eos> These buildings. Do these look over Snow's gardens?<eos> - I...<eos> - They do.
I'm here to win the $50. Is that so?<eos> I took it apart because of the nitrogen compartment.<eos> Seeing as how the bus ride was kind of bumpy and you know nitro.<eos> I could've used a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.<eos> Bell Labs tested that with their Rocket Belt and I guess there were some issues with maneuverability, flight duration, and stuff.<eos> It's a jet pack.<eos> Obviously.<eos> You made this yourself?<eos> Athena, what are you doing here?<eos> Did you or didn't you?
Mr. Walker, please tell me you can do better than "fun."<eos> Anything's possible.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> If I was walking down the street, and I saw some kid with a jet pack fly over me,<eos> I'd believe anything's possible.<eos> I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
How did you do that?<eos> - What?<eos> - That.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> In a car. How did you get here?<eos> You didn't just walk through a wormhole?<eos> You're making me feel like I did.<eos> I just met you.<eos> Then why are you acting like you know me?<eos> I don't.
Mm-hmm. Hit me again, Mike.<eos> Or maybe not, I don't know.<eos> Right now it's just a theory.<eos> So, what's all this fuss about my dahlia?<eos> How do I know I can really trust you?<eos> The truth will set you free.<eos> The ID number matches the one that came through the wormhole.<eos> But that's probably just a coincidence.<eos> You people don't believe in coincidences.<eos> Sure we do. Yeah.
Just lay low, keep your mouth shut.<eos> You know, don't take a camera.<eos> Go empty-handed, seriously.<eos> You'll humiliate yourself any other way, trust me.<eos> I know everything about it.<eos> All right. I'm not afraid of that.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> - No. I don't smoke.<eos> - Doesn't mean you don't want some.<eos> Yes, it does.
$100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo, when we didn't even know what our company made.<eos> A $650,000 mold for the Cube because God forbid the angles be 90.1 instead of 90.<eos> I forbid the angles to be 90.1 instead of 90.<eos> That box could be on display at the Guggenheim.<eos> Don't give them reason to say to the press you have a chip on your shoulder.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I don't have a chip on my shoulder.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But don't give them a reason to say you do.<eos> I don't.
By living off of them.<eos> By not letting myself be imprisoned and degraded by them.<eos> Imprisoned?<eos> I can't get rid of you.<eos> I need a doctor, and I need a dentist.<eos> I dropped out of college after a semester, but, okay, let's have a look.<eos> You will support your daughter and her mother.<eos> Did you pay someone $1,500 to bless your house?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Did you?
And it appears to be two strikes in a row for Steve Jobs.<eos> Students and educators are finding it difficult to justify the machine's high cost.<eos> So much for the Black Cube.<eos> NeXT just sold its factory to Canon, and laid off half its employees.<eos> In the world of computers, it's kill or be killed.<eos> Apple Computer has fallen on hard times.<eos> It is laying off about 2,500 people.<eos> Apple is continuing to lose market share with no new innovations in the pipeline except the Newton, a pet project of CEO John Sculley.<eos> If you really want to be mobile, you want a Newton PDA.<eos> But, then again, maybe you don't.
I would say Steve was the big-picture guy and I liked a solid workbench.<eos> When people ask me what the difference is now, I say<eos> Steve's an asshole.<eos> Your products are better than you are, brother.<eos> That's the idea, "brother."<eos> And knowing that, that's the difference.<eos> It's not binary.<eos> You can be decent and gifted at the same time.<eos> He didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Somewhere between 500 and 1,000 songs, right in your pocket, because I can't stand looking at that inexplicable Walkman anymore.<eos> You're carrying around a brick playing a cassette tape.<eos> We're not savages.<eos> So I'm gonna put 1,000 songs in your pocket.<eos> You can do that?<eos> You want to watch from backstage?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go, Cue 1.<eos> You remember that painting you did on the original Mac?<eos> I do.
One tank between the two of us.<eos> All your problems solved.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> It's my tank!<eos> I was supposed to be in there!<eos> But you insisted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Yes, you did, remember?<eos> Remember?<eos> I did.
My God, Bauer.<eos> There's no network.<eos> No connection to other facilities.<eos> Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone.<eos> You're not alone, my love.<eos> It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer,areyouthere?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> Ifthesystemisa lie, automated, how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Cartwright?<eos> Did I get you?<eos> Vincent Bauer, you don't have to do this.<eos> We might be the only ones left alive.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is that what you were thinking when I was laying there dying?<eos> When you were looking at your little photo?<eos> I'm sorry, I made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
And we'd have a baby. A girl.<eos> And if she ever needed me, I would do anything for her. Anything.<eos> I would've made a really great mom.<eos> The best.<eos> God, this totally sucks!<eos> It's so bogus!<eos> I should have known something was up with this place.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> What the hell kind of summer camp has waterbeds?<eos> What do we do now?
Are you kidding me?<eos> Blake.<eos> I want you to know that I respect what you and your dad have.<eos> And I know that your mom moving in has to feel like a pretty big step.<eos> But I'm never gonna try to change what you have with him, or take his place.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
There's no way I'm actually standing on an armed mine.<eos> You are now, Jagoff.<eos> That right there is an east German model<eos> SMI-35 landmine.<eos> And it ain't no dud.<eos> If you ever loved me, stop.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I can't.<eos> I couldn't even if I wanted to,<eos> But I really, really don't.
No, no, please!<eos> Look at... look at daddy, look at daddy.<eos> You see him?<eos> Look at this, look at it.<eos> He loves it, he gets off on it, don't you?<eos> Get the fuck down!<eos> Back up! He loves it, he gets off on this, he loves seeing the fear In his victims' eyes, look at your daddy.<eos> You love it?<eos> You like seeing this?<eos> Oh you don't?
Strip.<eos> Hey, do it to me, do it to me, okay?<eos> - Do it to you?<eos> - Yes! Please. Why would I do it to you you fat fuck?<eos> Do it to me.<eos> You want to eat panties? I have Alicia's panties!<eos> You remember...<eos> You done?<eos> Are you gonna shut the fuck up now? You remember her, Alicia!<eos> - You done?
And he better fucking hurry.<eos> Yeah, it's very funny.<eos> Hm, hey, excuse me, do you know where... is there a...<eos> Erin.<eos> -Jonah.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, I...<eos> I thought you moved to Brooklyn.<eos> Yeah, no, I did, I umm...
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.<eos> I am thinking the Boov should never have come to Smekland.<eos> To Earthland.<eos> So I am saying the sorry to you...<eos> Gratuity Tucci.<eos> Call me Tip.<eos> It was a new home, a new country.<eos> I tried to make friends at school... but I was this nerd from Barbados.<eos> But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.<eos> Yeah, I did.
How does he get fucked every time? What is that?<eos> Hey, he wants it that much.<eos> Well, I don't have anything like that. Do you?<eos> Sure. Never ever to rest my head on the same pillow twice.<eos> - Well, travel costs.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> I need $500,000 to buy me five years.<eos> Right now, I'm only short $499,500.<eos> - Well, luck will find you then. - I know.<eos> When it does,
- Some.<eos> Which?<eos> You better speak, Nicholas.<eos> And I suggest you begin right now.<eos> I'll ask just two questions, Baby.<eos> If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
- Yes.<eos> With Mum?<eos> No, not with Mum.<eos> Mum?<eos> I'm in the bath.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> What?<eos> The deer.<eos> Where you got out, it's where we hit something when we arrived.<eos> - Did you?
A more aggressive story about the corruption within these aid agencies.<eos> But we felt it was too broad.<eos> Don't imply this has anything to do with anyone other than you, Mike.<eos> You said write about one boy.<eos> Suggest the issues through one boy's story.<eos> A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right.<eos> You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> - I did, just not all in one place.
- In like a... corporate-loving, government-trusting, gung-ho kind of way.<eos> They haven't seen me since I looked like... this.<eos> - Right.<eos> How does your family feel about you leaving?<eos> They're happy I'm finally getting my life together.<eos> That's an extreme transformation!<eos> That's incredible.<eos> Can I keep this? I'm going to need to keep this.<eos> How long have you felt robotic?<eos> I don't.
Uh.<eos> We... going to...<eos> - I just.<eos> - What?<eos> I-We came to-to-to practice.<eos> Pull all night, you know.<eos> 'Cause tomorrow's the show and I don't... feel confident.<eos> I don't want to let you down.<eos> Pfeifer.<eos> I really don't
I'm not sure this is a good idea.<eos> EGBOK.<eos> "Everything's going to be okay."<eos> You know it.<eos> Do you think she's pretty?<eos> Her hair is nice.<eos> Good facial symmetry.<eos> Delicate features.<eos> Nice fashion sense.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm curious to know more about her.<eos> So, just ask her.<eos> I did.<eos> - And how'd that go?<eos> - Not as anticipated.<eos> On some level, she regrets abandoning her graduate study.<eos> She's proud of her achievement in the field of entertainment gaming. But this does not supplant some imagined ideologized future in which she is a successful roboticist.<eos> Well, that's good info.<eos> She also doesn't like to be touched unexpectedly.<eos> Yeah, most people don't.
She didn't say goodbye to me.<eos> I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> I do not however understand the complete abandonment of manners.<eos> Manners?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Only that I find it amusing to hear proper manners invoked by someone who tries to bust in on young ladies while they're pissing.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Rectangular, yes.<eos> But vending machines are square.<eos> That's square?<eos> Kind of square.<eos> That shape there?<eos> Mike, did you go to college?<eos> I did not.<eos> On your resume, it said that you went to Ithaca College.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I booked her with a vendor at 5:15.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Yes, hello?<eos> Hi. I'm Ben whittaker.<eos> I have a 3:55 appointment with Ms. ostin.<eos> 3:55?<eos> I thought she was meeting with her new intern.<eos> That's me.<eos> How you doing?
- It is.<eos> I never fall asleep in the car, so that was actually amazing.<eos> Apologize for the racket.<eos> Barely noticed.<eos> I'll pretend i believe you.<eos> I love this house.<eos> It just looks happy to me.<eos> Like, if it was in a kid's book, it would make you feel good when you turned the page and saw it.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
You will reach your destination in300yards.<eos> Little does GPS lady know she is an accomplice to a crime.<eos> The woman has a heart condition.<eos> Think of it as a good deed.<eos> I never thought you'd be a bad influence on me, whittaker.<eos> Oh, relax, fellas. This is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> The key is under a flowerpot.<eos> We go in, we delete, we disappear.<eos> She doesn't have an alarm, right? Nope.<eos> She does not.
Ben. Ben, you there?<eos> Becky, don't screw around.<eos> Put Jules on.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> -She's in a meeting.<eos> -Interrupt her.<eos> Ben, what's up?<eos> Jules, your mother has an alarm.<eos> -No, she doesn't.<eos> -Yes, she does.
- And why is that?<eos> - I kill people.<eos> Small world?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Your father's dead. - Two days ago.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I was there.<eos> - Did you kill him?<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> He did it himself.
- Clinton Street.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> That's on my way home.<eos> Can I walk you?<eos> I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.<eos> So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> - You don't know her?<eos> - (Chuckles) I do.
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.<eos> - I need to say something to you.<eos> - Can you... Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?<eos> - It's not...<eos> - Please.<eos> So...<eos> Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.<eos> - Yeah. - (Chuckles) Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,<eos> I'd have to say no for your sake. So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?<eos> I didn't.
You, Janik.<eos> We've never met before, right?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> - What're you doing?<eos> - I can't leave.<eos> Look. You can't stay.<eos> We just killed those men.<eos> We didn't kill them.<eos> You did.
He couldn't possibly be talking about that "Syndicate"?<eos> 'Cause you assured me that, that "Syndicate" was merely an exercise?<eos> And it was, Prime Minister.<eos> I can assure you.<eos> And yet, here we have the Central Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Prime Minister, your life is in danger.<eos> I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location.<eos> Sir. Does the name, Solomon Lane, ring a bell?<eos> Yes. Unfortunately, it does.
- I want to know how!<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How, how, how?<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How?<eos> - It was her.<eos> Was she right?<eos> Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
By whom?<eos> Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me just makes me stronger.<eos> This framework is not compatible.<eos> The genetic coding tower is at 97%.<eos> You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.<eos> - I'm gonna say this once.<eos> - How about "none-ce"?<eos> - Shut it down!<eos> - Nope, not gonna happen.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> And you do?
That's why nobody cares what you think.<eos> Um...<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> She fucking gored me, man.<eos> That was loud.<eos> - Oh, it's not-- - for the vegetarians.<eos> Has she been acting like this all night?<eos> Yeah. David, too.<eos> Look, I'm all for whatever you gotta do to get by, especially you two, with what you went through, but you didn't lose your mind.<eos> Oh, I didn't?
Have you?<eos> Heard anything?<eos> From therese?<eos> No.<eos> She must have started her job at the times, though.<eos> I should have said: Therese. Wait.<eos> Who the hell is turning around in my drive?<eos> I should go.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I do.
- No?<eos> You have something good... and beautiful hidden inside of you.<eos> Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me.<eos> We're perfect for each other.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
- Yeah, why didn't you call me?<eos> - We all called you, David.<eos> - Really?<eos> - The guys are right behind me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - What did you do to the machine?<eos> You know, I'm just making some modifications.<eos> Modifications?<eos> Why?<eos> We did a full systems check yesterday.
Hello?<eos> Your girlfriend's on the phone.<eos> - Hello? - Hey, Chuck.<eos> This is Peppermint Patty. - How have you been?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> Listen, I have some great news for you, Chuck.<eos> The Winter Dance is in a few weeks and I'm saving a dance for you.<eos> Anyway, Marcie put me in charge of the refreshment committee.<eos> I took it upon myself and signed you up to make the cupcakes.<eos> You did what?
Mostly.<eos> Oh, some weren't braves?<eos> Some weren't men.<eos> An Indian woman is still an Indian.<eos> She knows how to use a bow and a spear, and so do her children.<eos> Why do you hate them so much?<eos> You should ask my mother and my sisters.<eos> - I never met 'em.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> You never did.
It's good.<eos> I know.<eos> The Michelin men came last night.<eos> - And?<eos> - We fucked it up.<eos> I fucked it up.<eos> Fucked it up a long time ago.<eos> Why'd you take care of me?<eos> 'Cause I need you.<eos> We all do.
Okay, just...<eos> Eugene, stop.<eos> - Are there any more?<eos> - No.<eos> Are you okay? Eugene, are you okay?<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, Eugene, listen to me, you did the right thing.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You did the right thing.
The private sector can no longer think only vertically, and the aid sector can no longer exist with solely horizontal humanitarianism.<eos> What we need, what we really need here...<eos> Is money.<eos> I was going to say... sir, is balance.<eos> When our mission... is of greater... service to ourselves than to our clients or beneficiaries, then we're destined to failure.<eos> - You're in Spain.<eos> - And you're in a swanky suit.<eos> Jim, why are you here?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> - No, I don't.
He was originally Endel Keller.<eos> Your right leg starts moving.<eos> See how I'm doing it.<eos> One more time.<eos> Lower your shoulder.<eos> Hand up.<eos> Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found! - Well?<eos> - My grandfather did.
You better not drop me!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Excuse me, sir. I hate to bother you, but I need to fight you.<eos> I was in Nam!<eos> And I fucking loved it!<eos> James, you gotta throw something back!<eos> Darnell!<eos> Save me!<eos> Attention inmates, lockdown in five minutes.<eos> What did they do to my yard?
This sexy pillow here.<eos> Oh, my God, can you just...<eos> Ooh, Greg, this pillow's name is Francesca.<eos> Don't joke, I can't deal with that.<eos> She's a filthy Italian woman.<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> Just, to hell with college, to hell with growing up?<eos> Greg, don't.
I've been clean two years today.<eos> I hope it stays that way.<eos> I've fought hard for this.<eos> Each and every day, even now.<eos> You know, my mom... she always said that in life you can be whatever you want if you want it hard enough.<eos> What bullshit.<eos> It's bullshit and she knows it.<eos> She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.
This isn't Social Services.<eos> Nico, I'd like to help, but like I said, times are hard.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Penalty!<eos> It's a sure thing, it's gonna be OK.<eos> Don't mess up!<eos> Robert, if he scores, I'll double up your 600.<eos> - I'll go to the bank right now.<eos> - Kid, it's not worth it.<eos> And if he doesn't?
We can still do this.<eos> You're on your own Danny.<eos> I can't be implicated in any of this.<eos> Wait, who are you?<eos> I am working for Mattel.<eos> You piece of shit!<eos> Killing my family pup wasn't enough for you huh?<eos> What are you gonna do now?<eos> You don't deserve him Johnny, you never did.<eos> - You never did!
Walk away or I'll scream.<eos> He won't care.<eos> He's here to kill you, Katia.<eos> And I'm here to stop him.<eos> I know you don't have any reason to trust me but look at him.<eos> Look at how he moves. Look at the shadows on his coat. Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
It's flexible, extremely strong<eos> He had his nervous system heightened. Wired for speed.<eos> I've heard of these Syndicate experiments..<eos> If they can do this with him...<eos> Now, will you tell me where Litvenko is?<eos> Swear to me that you're not going to hurt him.<eos> Swear it.<eos> Alright, I swear it.<eos> Diana, did you hear that?<eos> I did.
Just one more thing.<eos> The two of you, you're out here alone, are you not?<eos> Yeah, just us.<eos> I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.<eos> Service will be up in 20.<eos> Finn's preparing the feeds now.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
I will not put my children through that! I will not put myself through that.<eos> What would our friends think?<eos> What would the community think?<eos> We'd be the laughingstock of this entire city.<eos> I can't just shoot someone like an animal.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've taken it, but the more I think about it I don't think he has more.<eos> Oh, he does.
We're so remote. But you made it.<eos> Welcome to my new hospital.<eos> Yeah, it's very new.<eos> We're still settling in.<eos> They haven't woken up yet?<eos> Not a single one.<eos> They don't even move in their sleep.<eos> How is your leg?<eos> Didn't you use my herbal cream?<eos> I did.
- I have been hand plucked to be put on a waiting list, to put on a very well known TV singing competition.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep! I know what you're thinking...<eos> Oh! Bumper! You shut your face and kiss me, Bumper<eos> Bumper, please, just...<eos> That is not even how I talk.<eos> You talk exactly like this.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
We don't want... hey, we don't want that.<eos> Hey, Becs, let's go meet the Green Bay Packers.<eos> I'm just kidding, would you like to have sex later?<eos> No.<eos> So, that's a "no" then?<eos> Because of the wink and...<eos> It's a hundred percent "no".<eos> Dax, I swear, if this kid was not my nephew.<eos> Hey, I know you're crazy busy, but have you had a chance to check-out those demos?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.
Uh, actually, we're busy.<eos> Oh, really, because I wouldjust...<eos> I would love to just get together with you and Marco and hear about what you guys are doing.<eos> You know, just clear the air.<eos> - I don't know, Mom...<eos> - Honey, I really...<eos> I really want to work things out. I do. I just...<eos> I don't want to not see you because of this.<eos> You know, I don't want to lose you for stupid reasons.<eos> Neither do I.
What's the opportunity?<eos> - It's a good one.<eos> - We're having dinner at the Baskins.<eos> So I'm sorry to say it, but you guys will have to leave now.<eos> - Can I have this Chipwich?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Marty and Jiselle can wait.<eos> - Didn't you park over at Harold's?<eos> - How do you know Harold?<eos> - They don't.
- Brooke, this is uncomfortable.<eos> - Dylan doesn't want to do this.<eos> - You don't know what I want.<eos> I know you see me a certain way, but I'm not just some square.<eos> I saw Nirvana live and this is way before Nevermind.<eos> You seem really cool to me.<eos> I DJ'ed at my college radio station, the 2:00 am slot.<eos> We played Mudhoney, Superchunk, Trip Shakespeare, I mean...<eos> No one wants to hear about your glory days in college radio, Dylan. Okay?<eos> I do.
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.<eos> I have words that would be howled in the desert air<eos> where hearing should not latch them.<eos> My ever gentle cousin.<eos> Stands Scotland where it did?<eos> Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.<eos> How does my wife?
I'm sorry, but you can't help but think...<eos> You can't help... but look at kids,<eos> I mean, people your age, and not think... why are they still there, and she isn't?<eos> Like that bloody child you paraded at us like some fucking ghost of our girl.<eos> Well, you can do that, Rob.<eos> You can find someone else. We can't.<eos> So don't sit there... thinking that we've not been doing anything for you... because we bloody have.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hold on, Josh, one sec.<eos> What, did I do something wrong?
Anything new<eos> The Matoviés have sold their house.<eos> They're moving to Mitrovica.<eos> Bu! they don't know what to do about grandma.<eos> How's your grandfather?<eos> - Voja says he won'! be going soon.<eos> Does he drink?<eos> -Who?<eos> Voja!<eos> - He does...
You have any [note weapons'?<eos> Search the place!<eos> Why the harassment'?<eos> Can't you see that our father died?<eos> We", we have to respond.<eos> We received a report...<eos> I see you, Bashkiml.!<eos> I got here first!<eos> No you didn't!<eos> -I did!
Who shot you'?<eos> We were playing...<eos> Who shot you'?<eos> Tell grandfather who shot you.<eos> Te" us!<eos> Tell us who shot you.<eos> A Serb.<eos> Where is the gun'?<eos> I don't know...<eos> - You don't?
A life!<eos> You have a life.<eos> It's not mine!<eos> Yeah. Sure, mate. I'll be your best man.<eos> You'll need a suit.<eos> I'll pay.<eos> That could be awkward.<eos> Don't talk to me about awkward.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> The others do!
So how much do your parents pay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
So how much do your parents pay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> I don't.
- Seriously?<eos> Nope. Can't drink, I can't smoke.<eos> I'm really boring.<eos> - I bought it back in pieces from France.<eos> - Right.<eos> One of these babies can go right through a man.<eos> - Mark!<eos> - You wanna see it work?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Just take a seat, OK?<eos> All right.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Shouldn't we be going to the hospital?<eos> Look, we have all the same equipment here, and there's nobody more qualified to take care of you than me.<eos> They don't understand this.<eos> Just gonna get you stable first, OK?<eos> You're gonna be OK.<eos> - I thought I lost you.<eos> - You did.
No, the professor flunked me.<eos> So I shot him.<eos> Look I rather just pay criminals like yourself to drive the super car.<eos> Whenever I have to move it's location, okay?<eos> - Make sense to me.<eos> - But the math doesn't add up!<eos> You are offering us $ 100,000 in a down economy.<eos> What was your best bid from Aflac?<eos> Look! Do you want the job or not?<eos> Yes, he does.
No. It's a simple gesture. to show how special you are to us.<eos> Giving your sweeten loving present to him.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Mom was right.<eos> I should have joined an ordinary motorcycle gang instead!<eos> What a baby ...<eos> I still need to talk to you.<eos> Before you do. There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> - You do?

What for?<eos> I need it.<eos> If you continue to gamble, we will lose the farm.<eos> It's not for gambling.<eos> What's it for?<eos> Why should it matter what it's for?<eos> It's my money.<eos> I work for it, don't I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
You may run your farm, if you wish. Without risk.<eos> I'll pay your departed husband's debts and guarantee its financial stability.<eos> It can be your pastime.<eos> Of course, we'd need to wait, for propriety's sake.<eos> But when you're ready, I'm offering you shelter.<eos> Comfort.<eos> A safe harbor.<eos> As my wife.<eos> You must at least admire my persistence.<eos> I do.
Any of you speak English? No, no, no.<eos> Any of you want to make a thousand euros? Yeah.<eos> Sure!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hi.<eos> How about a drink?<eos> How about your room?<eos> How the hell did they rob a bank?<eos> They'd have to have his... He did. They did.<eos> Someone did.
I didn't mean anything by it, what I meant was...<eos> You're just a goddamn actor so full of his own bullshit you wouldn't know if your ass was on fire.<eos> All right?<eos> I got real problems! I was...<eos> I was working at 16, I was married at 17, we'd already split up by the time she found out she was pregnant.<eos> - I got a seven-year-old son in New York...<eos> - You have a son?<eos> Of course I have a son!<eos> I told you about him.<eos> - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did.
So, you're living with him now, right?<eos> Yeah, and no.<eos> No, he wasn't around.<eos> He left before I was born.<eos> Oh, that's gotta suck.<eos> You gotta totally be loving living with him then, huh?<eos> Hey, you smoke, right?<eos> What do you mean, like, cigarettes?<eos> No, no, like...<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What?<eos> We had a little fight but I'm sure you know whose fault it was.<eos> It was not my fault.<eos> You never accept that it's your fault.<eos> You never talk about your feelings.<eos> It's like being in love with some tiny little brick wall.<eos> How the hell you understand her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's really hard.<eos> - I don't.
Where is Misty?<eos> Bo._._ i._ not in the office.<eos> Let him oo. Jimmy.<eos> What you sent me there for i._n't there.<eos> I run a paper, Ro._ie..<eos> if it's news. I print it.<eos> Misty!<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I do.
But I think he's got a cylinder.<eos> Jones, he's got a cylinder. He's got a cylinder.<eos> Come on. I'm at the end of my umbilical.<eos> Can't rea...<eos> I got him. I got him.<eos> Mitch, how much further?<eos> We're ten feet from the bell. Get ready to haul him in.<eos> Mitch, hurry up!<eos> Let's go. I need you to do the cylinders.<eos> Do the fucking cylinder!
- What should I do now?<eos> - Run, sir! - Again?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Run, I shall, like a bloody gazelle!<eos> The Mortdecai men have always been in tip-top shape, don't you know?<eos> Fit as a fiddle!<eos> Oh, it's burning...<eos> I... I can't go on...<eos> Want to die...<eos> No, I don't.
It's not that bad.<eos> "It's not that bad."<eos> I ought to knock you out myself.<eos> You know how many times I had to carry your father up these stairs...<eos> - because he couldn't walk?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How many times I had to wipe his ass because he couldn't use his hands?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No. You want brain damage.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It's getting harder to walk up this hill.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Anyway, it's a good day today.<eos> It's a good day, got no problems.<eos> Bills are paid.<eos> Only thing is, it's tough to sleep at night sometimes. My back.<eos> No matter what you do, it catches up to you.<eos> Anyway, shall we see what's new in the world today?<eos> - Hey, Rocky!<eos> - Hey, how you doing?

- Get in the ring.<eos> - Hurry up and get ready.<eos> - I've been ready.<eos> Good.<eos> I've been waiting on you.<eos> Come on, just put your gloves on and stop talking so much.<eos> We got a few things to do.<eos> It's all about you.<eos> I already had my career.<eos> I did okay.
But it can't be any of you.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> I go into the face-off machine.<eos> Get a whole new face.<eos> I turned up. They'll never know it's me.<eos> Do you have quarters?<eos> 'Cause it cost 50 cents.<eos> What, I've got to pay?<eos> No, because it doesn't exist.<eos> Yes, it does!
I cried. Peed, I think.<eos> Having a heart attack.<eos> I can't do this, Nancy.<eos> Fine was the real spy, not me.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm here for you, okay.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> I'm gonna talk you through this, alright.<eos> Put your camera in. I want to see your room.<eos> Ewf. No, you don't.
- Amber!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know the police were here.<eos> This is my colleague. Detective<eos> The one I fucking told you about.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did, Helen Keller!
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Francis Mays is an unemployed telemarketer living off her disability cheques.<eos> Oh, sweet Jesus!<eos> Any who wears reading glasses in their passport photo?<eos> She's only kidding.<eos> Oh my god. It was a good one.<eos> Yeah, actually I'm not.<eos> I don't have a sense of humor.<eos> - No, you don't.
Any man of honor who finds the lost throne and dons the crown will unlock all of the magic and ascends to the throne as king of the world!<eos> Of course, it's all made up.<eos> The man that attacked me is dangerous.<eos> If he gets his hands on the crown, he will use its powers for evil and personal gain.<eos> Well, with the right amount of power, every man is dangerous.<eos> Do you see that, Father?<eos> Those are words of a king.<eos> - I don't want to be king!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not.

Oh, and then, one time, this fly went down my throat, and it was buzzing all the way down.<eos> It... It tickled. How long have the McCluskeys been stealing from you?<eos> How long?<eos> I don't know. Since Mama died. Your old man ain't doing nothing?<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Pop says they're just desperate, like all folk.<eos> Well, they can catch their own goddamn food.<eos> They don't know how to trap.<eos> They don't know the spots, how to catch 'em.<eos> Not like Pop does.
I'm not fucking dying in here.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going home to them.<eos> Don't worry... I'm not voting for you.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Yeah, We're... We're gonna get out of here, man.<eos> - Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man. No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
Yeah, and I'm sure it's great for business.<eos> - I don't do porn!<eos> - Who paid for them?<eos> Tell them. Go ahead.<eos> Oh, it's okay, sweetheart.<eos> Who paid for them?<eos> - Was it your employer?<eos> - No?<eos> - I-I mean, he did, but it's not like that.<eos> He did? No?
He's talking about getting r-I-d of the k-I-d sooner rather than later.<eos> I think she can spell.<eos> We just need to get this over with.<eos> Rip the band-aid off.<eos> Why drag it out?<eos> - You're outnumbered, man.<eos> - He's right.<eos> It's over.<eos> Hey. You want to live, right? Yeah.<eos> But I don't...
What?<eos> What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right. He did.<eos> When?<eos> The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.

- You shouldn't have lied to us.<eos> - I didn't lie.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You said you were married.<eos> Iam married.<eos> Just not to him, and I do have a daughter, Emily.<eos> I didn't lie about that. How many people in here do you think were married? Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.

Aziz, stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Aziz, they'll come back.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> They'll come back.<eos> Celal!<eos> Did you let her know?<eos> A slim waist and a good set of teeth.<eos> Celal, did you tell her that you don't want a moustache?<eos> I did.
Rascal...<eos> What happened? He isn't fit to talk to.<eos> No need to keep any relation with him. Should I come? The time has come tell him.<eos> Tell him what?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> Are you small kids? Tell him... Get lost.<eos> What's wrong? Did..<eos> Marbles? - Marbles?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> - I didn't either.
- It should've been you!<eos> - The bees were not to blame.<eos> They're all you care about! No!<eos> I care about Roger.<eos> I care about him very much.<eos> The bees... Didn't do it.<eos> The bees were not to blame.<eos> It was the wasps!<eos> Roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees.<eos> And he did.
Even if I wanted to, it's impossible.<eos> The branch doesn't have the liquidity and I can't do transfer it unless I'm in the office.<eos> You can't work from outside precisely to avoid situations like this.<eos> Don't try to trick me.<eos> I've been working on this for quite some time.<eos> Today's Friday and the end of the month.<eos> There's plenty of payroll and pension money at the bank.<eos> 67,547 from your account, without arousing any suspicion.<eos> I don't have that much money in my account.<eos> You don't?
So Jack, anything recognizably?<eos> Jack, anything?<eos> Your room, Jack.<eos> What's outside the room?<eos> - Space.<eos> No.<eos> - The world.<eos> - You think the kid's on something?<eos> - Ok, listen, when you step out the door...<eos> - No, no, you don't?
Got something in the kitchen I think.<eos> Oh yes, I got something very tasty in the kitchen, I think.<eos> Let me see...what's here.<eos> Hello.<eos> I didn't know you were up.<eos> Pretty good, am I right?<eos> I like this kind, too.<eos> Kind of sweet, but pretty good.<eos> You really have a dog?<eos> I do.
Pascal needs to have the fucking shit kicked out of him.<eos> Why do you think he would say something like that?<eos> Because he doesn't want you to be happy.<eos> He can't deal with the fact that you've moved on, and he hasn't.<eos> You are so full of shit, Monroe!<eos> I've seen you staring at her tits!<eos> My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No. I don't.

You don't love me.<eos> I...<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, you don't love me. I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Sa!<eos> Daddy, he sent me a picture.<eos> I'm sending it to you now.<eos> It's Me!<eos> I won't make it.<eos> Without a doctor, your heart is useless to me.<eos> If you were not my brother,<eos> I would have done this over 10 years ago.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> But you do.
But anything good could be better, don't you think?<eos> Is Mom a communist?<eos> No.<eos> Am I?<eos> Well, why don't we give you the official test?<eos> Mom makes your favorite lunch.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> And at school, you see someone with no lunch at all.<eos> What do you do?
We gotta use it.<eos> Well.<eos> So, you had five jobs.<eos> Mmm-hmm. And now we got them and now you got none?<eos> Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers.<eos> And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
Thank you for finally saying something truthful.<eos> Where's that guy been? Huh?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> You've been completely aloof and totally remote and distant.<eos> It's like I don't even know you anymore.<eos> I feel like you're just silently judging me.<eos> What do you even want anymore?<eos> Do you even want this wedding?<eos> Do you even want to marry me?<eos> Maybe I don't!
Just 'cause Ed's retiring doesn't mean I can't get along with his replacement.<eos> I know Greg from metals.<eos> I don't care if you know a girl from Kalamazoo.<eos> We don't want you on the business because we don't want you on any business.<eos> Look, Ferg, you're not still mad at me for leaving?<eos> That was six years ago.<eos> And you never hired me anyway.<eos> When you bought Putnam, Powell Lowe, I came with the furniture.<eos> People come in and out of our doors all the time, Ken, but they don't walk out with $4 million of Birds Eye products.<eos> Of course they do.
So he could have followed you here.<eos> Give me your ID.<eos> We don't need anybody else tracking you.<eos> You think he's tracked me all this time?<eos> Sam, who is he?<eos> His code name is the Watchmaker.<eos> He's one of the most wanted assassins in the world.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> How did you know I would come here?<eos> I didn't.
Please hold on.<eos> Miss Smith, this is Sergeant Evans.<eos> We have your location.<eos> Stay where you are, we're sending a...<eos> There is a man she is identifying as Nichols as being inside her house.<eos> Now, once again, we do not have independent confirmation... is talking about a woman in Duluth, Georgia, who has called the local police to say...<eos> Visual on them, give me 20 feet.<eos> You two, the second team.<eos> So you're saying you didn't know him at all.<eos> No. I didn't.
Not after...<eos> He transferred to Boise, right?<eos> Theresa, I can't...<eos> You can't disclose any details.<eos> I know, I know. I heard it a million times from Ethan to the point where we barely talked.<eos> Theresa. I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
I try, but...<eos> And even when I'm with my family, I feel it.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> I'm afraid of what might happen to them.<eos> But, yes, I am taking the new medication.<eos> The story was that when the KGB learned about Nina Kulagina's ability, they performed a test with a living frog.<eos> This was back in 1970.<eos> The Soviets wanted to see if Nina could telekinetically affect the bioelectrical impulses in living tissue.<eos> To speed up and slow down its heartbeat.<eos> And allegedly, she did.
DROP THE KNIFE!<eos> I have Satan...<eos> I have Satan...<eos> I SAID DROP THE KNIFE!<eos> Did you tell her?<eos> Did you tell her all about it?<eos> I told her.<eos> When you meet these people, do you say to them... do you say that she was murdered?<eos> Please!<eos> No, you don't.
We have two days. We have to recruit more members and put together some sort of performance that doesn't totally humiliate us as a team.<eos> Uh, I have an idea that you are not gonna like, but you need to consider.<eos> We need to recruit Kitty.<eos> - No, Kurt! No!<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> She's talented.<eos> She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Okay. Come here.<eos> Give me your hands. Give me your hands.<eos> There's blood.<eos> What were those things on the other side of the wall?<eos> Wolves.<eos> This is wolf country.<eos> Here. Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
No, it's only a joke, Mick. I mean it...<eos> You know, it wasn't like that...<eos> Don't joke about these things, Fred.<eos> The prostate is serious. You are always fall for my jokes, Mick.<eos> You've been believing my every word for sixty years.<eos> I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah.<eos> When she left us... she killed herself.<eos> I just know what it said in the report - a car accident. A lapse at the wheel.<eos> My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.<eos> He's a drunk, you know, it's probably not in the report.<eos> He got us all involved in that Evangelical stuff, like that would make things better.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that.<eos> What was he like when he drank?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Why?<eos> No, I was just going through the slip logs and... I noticed something small, real small... like a couple of minutes missing.<eos> Now to most, that don't mean much, but to me... well, it kinda looks like someone might've borrowed time they didn't have.<eos> Probably just an error, something that small, you know.<eos> Or a dirty jump.<eos> Who am I talking to here?<eos> My captain... or my friend?<eos> Both.<eos> - Maybe you don't wanna hear this?<eos> - Sure he does.
My justice is divine.<eos> My laws are so simple you could write them on a pig's ear.<eos> In fact, I have.<eos> Law number one, "Those who work with bright, honest vigor<eos> "will be rewarded with prizes "and trophies "and confectionery!"<eos> Law number two,<eos> "Those who fail to work hard, "those who skive or malinger, "will hereby know the brooding majesty of my disapproval."<eos> Mark me well. I know no pity.<eos> No second chances.<eos> I don't do mercy.
Call, call on.<eos> - He's from the police.<eos> Put the damn door.<eos> Beware.<eos> My son.<eos> - Open the door, whore.<eos> Dirty whore, put that door.<eos> Damn.<eos> Zooi sucks.<eos> Now do the damn door, whore.
Not exactly the best way to send you off.<eos> Well, so, you're sending me off, huh?<eos> I've been thinking about what you said, about us both deserving to have our lives just be a little easier, a little less burdened, and it really hit home with me tonight.<eos> And not because I have feelings for the chef or anything, but I couldn't help but think, what if I did?<eos> It wouldn't be hard to tell the girls.<eos> There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do. You deserve that.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> We both do.
And even though I'm awake now, I'm not the guy you knew.<eos> I don't have any balance.<eos> I can barely walk on my own.<eos> And I do appreciate you being here, but everything's changed.<eos> I guess I just thought that... Since we were friends before, even if things are a little different now, we're still...<eos> That was then.<eos> And this new version of me doesn't feel like being friends.<eos> With anyone.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> How you doing?
(Scoffs) Between golf games and dinner parties, I highly doubt it.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> - What? - I think you're gonna love it.<eos> It's the same one you saw at that duty-free store in Florida, the one I had to like drag you away from.<eos> The one that cost like $300.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Yeah, I love it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Full disclosure, I've been stalking it online to see if it ever went on sale.<eos> - It didn't.
Just come on.<eos> - George, George, George. - Don't worry about it.<eos> Sorry. Excuse us.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Excuse us. I'm sorry. - George.<eos> It's all right. Hi. Sorry, excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We have to get to Boston as soon as possible, but your machines aren't being very helpful.<eos> Um, I'm a triple-bonus platinum flier, so you need to wait in the back of the line.<eos> No, I don't.
Half?<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you know what, there's still no excuse.<eos> You don't show up for work like this.<eos> I have been in this business for almost fourt... forever.<eos> And I have never seen this kind of behavior.<eos> I'll tell you, if an actor showed up like this on Kelly Girl...<eos> On what?<eos> Does no one remember my fucking show?<eos> I do.
- No, why would I throw it overboard?<eos> If you can't have the credit, no one can. - Is that it? - That's bullshit.<eos> You think she carried a man's corpse up those stairs?<eos> Maybe you helped her.<eos> You're the brawns, she's the brains.<eos> You conniving bitch!<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> If she said she didn't move it, she didn't move it.<eos> Maybe he did it.
No!<eos> Hi. Mmm.<eos> - You're OK?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Just cold and wet, but we'll be alright.<eos> Um, listen, Bradley about New York, I...<eos> I can't.<eos> This is my home.<eos> I kinda figured.<eos> - You did?
The worst thing about getting a lot of attention paid to you... is that you're afraid of bad attention.<eos> And if bad attention hurts you, the caliber of the weapon pointing at you has gone way up. Like from a .22 to a .45.<eos> Look, there are parts of me that want a lot of attention and think I'm really great... and want other people to see it.<eos> I think that's one of the ways you and I are sort of alike, you know?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, uh-- All right.<eos> Fuck.<eos> David.<eos> I'm not so sure you want to be me.<eos> I don't.
And I was in labour.<eos> I thought we'd hit a deer.<eos> Why couldn't you just apologise straight away - and then get out of my life?<eos> What now then?<eos> What am [supposed to do?<eos> Hit you?<eos> Would that make you feel better?<eos> What can we do to make you feel better?<eos> - I understand...<eos> - No, you don't!
Well, that's from whoever he works for.<eos> So, if we go this Saturday at the same time Donelle was there, we might find the one who killed Stephon.<eos> Off.<eos> Shit.<eos> You have a moment, ma'am?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you have company?<eos> I just haven't picked up.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Doing some work on the house?
You listen to me, Doctor.<eos> That ain't gonna stop these men.<eos> They got a job to do, and they mean to do it.<eos> They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight.<eos> W... what... what do you... What do you want from me?<eos> What you think I want?<eos> I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.
That ain't gonna stop these men.<eos> They got a job to do, and they mean to do it.<eos> They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight.<eos> W... what... what do you... What do you want from me?<eos> What you think I want?<eos> I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.<eos> You do that.
Are you with anyone?<eos> Are you with anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have to find it.<eos> Okay, it must be this way.<eos> I walked that direction.<eos> I could not find any trail.<eos> You don't want to leave.<eos> I do.
A job?<eos> That's why you're doing this?<eos> You do not get real work.<eos> Nobody speaks to you.<eos> You are there, but you are not.<eos> Without job i cannot take care of my family.<eos> So you come here instead...<eos> You do not understand my culture.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
What's your name?<eos> Takumi.<eos> That your whole name?<eos> Nakamura takumi.<eos> Tell me about your family.<eos> My wife kiiro she's so smart charming.<eos> We have one daughter, fuyu.<eos> Sorry I yelled at you, earlier.<eos> Maybe I deserved. No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Uh, okay, there we are at the lake house.<eos> I loved that lake.<eos> Yeah, you did. Just being near the water.<eos> It's my paradise.<eos> You know what your favorite thing to do was?<eos> At least from my eye, you used to love to go down there and walk.<eos> Those orchids.<eos> You'd be down there for hours, then you'd walk back up the stairs and you'd line 'em up right across that windowsill.<eos> You remember that.<eos> Of course I do.
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.<eos> Here, last piece.<eos> Does he know how famous you once was?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Black eye.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the confederacy put on the head of major marquis?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?<eos> No they didn't.
He's the fella - who shot the fella' - who was sheriff 'fore me.<eos> Precisely.<eos> What did she mean when she said, bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable?<eos> He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable.<eos> But all that just to guard her?<eos> I don't think that was the original idea, but... That's the idea now.<eos> - Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy? - Yeah.<eos> Five of you?<eos> Well, well, well, looks like minnie's haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.<eos> Yes it does.
General Sandy "don't give a damn" smithers!<eos> Captain Chris mannix, mannix marauders.<eos> - Erskine's boy?<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> May I sit down, sir?<eos> According to the Yankees, it's a free country.<eos> Genaral Sandy smithers... Boy... Oh boy.<eos> Did my daddy talk about you.<eos> I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell.<eos> Me and my boys did our part.
- Erskine's boy?<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> May I sit down, sir?<eos> According to the Yankees, it's a free country.<eos> Genaral Sandy smithers... Boy... Oh boy.<eos> Did my daddy talk about you.<eos> I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell.<eos> Me and my boys did our part.<eos> Just like erskine and his boys did their part.<eos> Hell yeah, we did.
That's nice.<eos> So...<eos> How you doin', black major?<eos> I ain't in the mood, Chris mannix.<eos> Leave me be from your horseshit.<eos> John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter?<eos> I tole' you jackass to hee-haw somewhere else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> - You did say, didn't ya'?<eos> - Yeah I did.
Him shakin', him cryin' me laughin' and him not understandin' but you understand, doncha' Sandy?<eos> I never did give your boy that blanket.<eos> Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked.<eos> No blanket.<eos> That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise.<eos> Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers, that you chose not to acknowledge.<eos> So what you gonna' do old man?<eos> You gonna' spend the next two or three days, ignore the nigger that killed your boy, ignoring how I made him suffer?<eos> Ignoring how I made him... Lick, all over my Johnson?<eos> The dumbest thing your boy ever did...
And about the men standing' next ta' ya' would be responsible.<eos> And I know who I got my money on.<eos> Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you.<eos> Not so fast Chris.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?
And I know who I got my money on.<eos> Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you.<eos> Not so fast Chris.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he?
Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay - maybe.<eos> But when you tell me minnie mink took the habadashery, the most precious thing to her in the whole world,<eos> and left it in hands of a goddamn Mexican?<eos> Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like minnie".<eos> Now I am calling you a liar, senior Bob.<eos> And if you lyin, which you are, then you killed minnie - and sweet Dave.<eos> Four measly bulltes and there goes senior, Bob.<eos> That still don't get us no closer... To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though.<eos> - Does it Chris?<eos> - No it sure don't.
No deal, tramp.<eos> Chris you're makin' the biggest mistake of your life!<eos> When our boys get here in a coupla' days, their gonna cut your nuts off!<eos> And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt.<eos> Well I guess I should be plum scared right now, huh?<eos> If you had any brains, you would be.<eos> You see... Here's the problem Daisy.<eos> In order for me to be scared of your threats, I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waiting' it out in red rock.<eos> And boy, oh boy...<eos> I sure don't.
And of course we'd have to do it in our flat. Hers is a hellhole.<eos> THAT was my idea.<eos> Well, that could work.<eos> I had a great time tonight, and even though it hasn't been long,<eos> I feel like I know you really well, Jessica.<eos> My name's not Jessica. It's Jess.<eos> Oh, I thought it was short for Jessica.<eos> It's not.<eos> Well, aside from not knowing your name, I feel like we've got really close.<eos> I do, too.
Aster, we have to go! They're gonna kill us!<eos> Unfortunately, my survival instincts outweigh my loyalty.<eos> And the world only believes the last man standing.<eos> Don't worry, though, you'll look great in the papers.<eos> Just tell me you did it.<eos> Tell me you killed Aster. Just say it.<eos> Probably didn't even pull the trigger.<eos> Just tell me who did.<eos> I just need to know.<eos> You did, honey.
Did you fake your orgasm?<eos> No!<eos> I didn't fake it.<eos> I... may have embellished it a little.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't want to hurt your feelings, love, and I had an emotional... one.<eos> An emotional orgasm?<eos> Why does sex have to be so goal oriented?<eos> It doesn't.
F.<eos> What other letters make the sound "F"?<eos> - P-H?<eos> - Very good.<eos> Patrick Thornton here... broadcasting out of Harmony on 109.9.<eos> Can anybody read me?<eos> Now, that is a real shame. Because we've got a very special show... in store for you today on Radio Harmony.<eos> Chock-full of contests, interviews... fantastic musical numbers.<eos> So let's begin with today's guests.<eos> How you doing, John Doe?
"ls there a connection between these two deaths?" "Mr."<eos> "There's a very clear connection."<eos> "Gas explosion for a gas explosion."<eos> "Rajan Sampat's death is revenge killing."<eos> "You mean to say that the Indian Government.." "is behind the assassination of the ISI agent."<eos> [MUSIC]... did your people kill Sajid Mir?<eos> No, sir.<eos> There's no question of our men being involved.<eos> Sir, we don't have permission to do all this.<eos> Of course you don't, Roy.
Husbands discipline them when they don't.<eos> Now, that's how it was with my father and his father on and on and on, back.<eos> But maybe for you and me it has to go a different way.<eos> I swear on the cross of my Lord Jesus, and by the holy iron which I hold, that I give you my fealty and pledge you my loyalty.<eos> If ever my hand is raised in rebellion against you again, then I ask that this holy iron may pierce my heart.<eos> Is that not enough, Claire?<eos> Do you not want me anymore?<eos> Do ye wish to live separately?<eos> I feel that's what I should want.<eos> But I don't.
That thought doesna pain me as much as it once might have.<eos> You are my home now.<eos> I want ye, Claire.<eos> I want ye so much, I can scarcely breathe.<eos> Will ye have me?<eos> Yes. Yes, I'll have you.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If you ever raise a hand to me again, James Fraser, I will cut your heart out and have it for breakfast.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you?
We were together five years, broke up three years ago.<eos> She's a bit strange.<eos> She's not well, on antidepressants.<eos> I've become a kind of brother. Or mother, I don't know.<eos> She sensed someone new in my life and she came to stir shit.<eos> It's the first time there's someone new since you broke up?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> You don't meet someone new every five minutes.<eos> Or I don't.
Do you know if she's on antidepressants or anything?<eos> Abilify, 5 mg. Three times a day.<eos> - l'll pack a bag for her.<eos> - Her doctor prescribed it?<eos> - Dr. Ménes.<eos> Various narcotics, happy pills.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - Cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy. Amphetamines.<eos> You know why she did it?<eos> Do you?
- You got an ulterior motive?<eos> I don't need one.<eos> I like you guys. You're fun.<eos> You're real clowns.<eos> Who's your favorite?<eos> Out of all of you?<eos> Not counting Arabs and Blacks.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> - We don't have an appointment.<eos> - Sure we do.
The time is now 11:45 P.M.<eos> Curfew will be enforced in 15 minutes.<eos> All citizens are to get off the streets...<eos> The time is now 11:45 P.M.<eos> Curfew will be enforced...<eos> Whenever there's an attack on that place... martial law.<eos> - I've never liked that place anyway.<eos> - Like you could afford to be inside.<eos> Hell, you don't know of anybody who's ever been in there.<eos> Like you do.
- Jesus, look at that.<eos> - Alan, do you hear me?<eos> - Scramble the S.R.T.<eos> - They're still holding at pier 62.<eos> Make it happen.<eos> I want every officer we have in the area<eos> - diverted to that facility right now.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You did it.
This is it.<eos> - That's the one.<eos> - This is the one. I can feel it. - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Yes!<eos> Identify yourself, soldier.<eos> I'm Jack, the new intern.<eos> I'm just taking out the trash.<eos> - Don't we have a janitor for that?<eos> - You do.
Shit. Mike's computer's password protected.<eos> That's probably a good thing. There's an insane amount of porn on that.<eos> How the hell am I gonna get those sales figures?<eos> You mean, you want all the numbers, like...<eos> Yeah, yeah. The spreadsheets are on Mike's computer and that's locked, so...<eos> - Oh, you don't have the password?<eos> - No, no.<eos> I don't wanna know the password, so I'm gonna have to rebuild the excel files from scratch.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can totally help, you know.<eos> Especially after what Ted did to you.
He's a perfect match.<eos> Deacon's a match and you are not?<eos> That's the situation.<eos> No wonder you two aren't close.<eos> There is the question of money.<eos> My doctor friend has a price of $20,000 American.<eos> Look Deacon I don't have that kind of cash on hand. Do you?<eos> George, what about you?<eos> For God's sakes, no.<eos> I do.
- I did.<eos> Look. Can we do this?<eos> - I can do it.<eos> But I worry about what you might think about me breaking my promise to Jesus, my saviour.<eos> My daughter Isabella, she's on the recipient list.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> George. I owe you.<eos> So listen to me.<eos> You don't really want the list.<eos> - Yes I do.
You don't belong here at all.<eos> Do you...<eos> Philippe?<eos> I knew it!<eos> Philippe Petit.<eos> Daredevil wire walker.<eos> I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes! -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
And I'll show you how, together, we can change things for the better.<eos> Or if you prefer, you can discover for yourself what is out here.<eos> It's your choice, Ethan.<eos> What you learn today is for your eyes and ears only.<eos> You do not tell your parents.<eos> You do not tell any adults for one simple reason.<eos> The future of this great town lies not with the adults but with you.<eos> Now, you may think what I'm asking is unfair.<eos> You may feel like your parents deserve to know.<eos> So did Chris.
We picked the right person.<eos> Let's go.<eos> "Japanese Consulate, Shanghai"<eos> Korean clans never work together.<eos> But Kim Koo and Kim Won-bong plan a joint assassination in Seoul?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> I didn't hear it. I'm their messenger.<eos> I deliver the money.<eos> Kim Koo thinks I skimmed off the top.<eos> So did you?
How about Japanese civilians?<eos> All civilians are innocent.<eos> Act like the bullets have eyes.<eos> Then, how about taking a photo?<eos> For the historical record.<eos> Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay. We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
What happens when you get hurt?<eos> Will you run to Mom, like you always do?<eos> You've never won a fight with me your whole life!<eos> Idiot!<eos> Not the hair!<eos> Not the hair!<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Relax, it's a brother-sister fight.<eos> - You know what it's like.<eos> - No, I don't.
You can get your flight to India. Damn it!<eos> I'm 30, I haven't had time to do anything.<eos> All day on the sofa, no trips, no wild stuff...<eos> - Now you think of that?<eos> - Travel is overrated.<eos> Well, you were never home.<eos> All your life out saving the world, you forgot about me.<eos> Since I'm going to die, I'll get it off my chest:<eos> Secret agents don't have kids.<eos> James Bond didn't, or Jason Bourne.
- Sure.<eos> Can you give me a lift?<eos> All this has opened my eyes, I have to make the leap.<eos> You know what I did today?<eos> You'll freak.<eos> I signed up for driving lessons.<eos> And I'm coming to India with you. Or wherever.<eos> You want to travel?<eos> Let's travel.<eos> Or do skydiving?
How's Remy working out?<eos> Well, we'd much rather have you there, but he's doing a fine job.<eos> Doug, do you... recall anything?<eos> - About what happened?<eos> - Why?<eos> Did the police find something?<eos> Not that we're aware of. And we've asked them to hold off questioning you until you're feeling more like yourself.<eos> Rachel, she...<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's what I do best.<eos> I kill people.<eos> Now I have three bartering chips.<eos> Don't forget about me.<eos> This salad sucks.<eos> Who made this shit'?<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't be sorry, man.<eos> Just do.
Keep running!<eos> We need to get that hostage.<eos> We're fucked.<eos> Got it'?<eos> Copy that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Lance, you see that shut, you take it, copy.<eos> Cutter, I'm hit.<eos> He shot my scope.<eos> How you doing?
Whew.<eos> - Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv?<eos> le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv?<eos> le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't.
Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv?<eos> le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I don't.
He got stabbed in the knee.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> It probably cut a tendon, but if you see Christos's face you won't believe it.<eos> Nikolaou left in tears, the rest are down in their cabins.<eos> An ambulance is on its way.<eos> Christos lost a lot of blood.<eos> You believed it.<eos> No I didn't.<eos> You did.
Yeah.<eos> The Weed of Christmas Present.<eos> I'm an athlete, so drug-free body. Drug-free zone. No smoking.<eos> You buying that for somebody and you're not gonna test it?<eos> That could be oregano.<eos> - Orega-what?<eos> - Oregano.<eos> So....<eos> Something special supposed to happen?<eos> It just did.
She wanted to get serious, but he wouldn't meet her parents.<eos> She wanted to move in... and you said you weren't in the right head place for her to move in.<eos> That's some straight-up bullshit.<eos> Give me some, Ma.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What, are you guys ganging up on me now?<eos> You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- Yes, boss.<eos> - Why past tense?<eos> Because he has escaped.<eos> You had no food yesterday.<eos> You have some today.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> The blacksmith left it for me, boss.<eos> When a man escapes, he takes as much food with him as he can.<eos> - He leaves nothing behind.<eos> - But he did, boss.
Yes, I realise that.<eos> BELL RINGS Ah.<eos> Come in.<eos> You wish to see...<eos> Oh, hello, Deborah.<eos> Hello, Reverend.<eos> You wish to see me?<eos> Yes, yes - about the church.<eos> I know what you are about to say.<eos> ~ You do?
Would you like some?<eos> He does not love you.<eos> He might lust after you, yes, but that is all - lust.<eos> Sharing you cannot possibly hurt him, for you are a whore - and men always share a whore.<eos> This is rather silly, Katherine, because I know how much you like to get it over with and get back to him and sadly, I will not start until you have spoken.<eos> We could be here till morning.<eos> What would you like me to say?<eos> Something truthful.<eos> You think I hate you... .. and you are right.<eos> I do.
Thou art Peter and upon this rock I shall build my church!<eos> The drought of March has pierced unto the root.<eos> And bathed each vein with liquor that has power to generate therein and sire the flower...<eos> ~ Four.<eos> ~ Four.<eos> Where's the other one?<eos> ~ You have it.<eos> ~ No, I do not.<eos> ~ You have it.<eos> You do.
There you go.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> What?<eos> Not drinking, and you did a totally selfless act today?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I won't tell Quinn, I promise.<eos> Covering it up feels weird.<eos> Not as weird as outing someone who's not ready yet, Rach.<eos> No, if you think that I wanted this just for the show, I...<eos> I don't... no, no, no.
You wouldn't be here if you didn't like the taste of blood.<eos> Rachel, it's mom again.<eos> Call me back, please.<eos> This is the fourth message I've left for you.<eos> A nap, really?<eos> Oh, lunch was just too exhausting?<eos> You know that girl's father was two years older than me?<eos> He drops dead.<eos> Yeah, he had a history.<eos> You don't.
What do you even know about it?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that you can eat whatever you want.<eos> You have your... your Greek omelet for breakfast, your cheeseburger for lunch... you don't even exercise, so you're barfing, too?<eos> Or you just have some freak metabolism?<eos> "Barfing, too"?<eos> No.<eos> I would never.<eos> And how do you know what I eat, anyway?<eos> I-I just do.
Well what was that about?<eos> You literally held me prisoner.<eos> You suck at poker, Shia, so I didn't want to put you in the position of having to bluff.<eos> Listen, the police... they ruled Mary's death a suicide, so there's not gonna be any more questions.<eos> Shia: Really?<eos> Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
We're engaged.<eos> I caught you getting your knob polished by a teenager.<eos> Whatever.<eos> She's a mouth.<eos> Yes, maybe I could have been a little more prudent.<eos> Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
I cannot live through another year of bulimia and side-boob covered in glitter.<eos> You and me both.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - You want me to try?<eos> I mean, 'cause it's not like he's taking girlfriend advice from you at this point.<eos> You know what?<eos> I finally found myself a ringer.<eos> If anyone can turn him, it's her.<eos> How we doing?
"Maybe," yeah.<eos> Go, then.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go.<eos> Do it.<eos> Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
This week, it is spa dates, all right?<eos> We've got four girls left...<eos> Anna, Faith, Grace, and Shamiqua.<eos> Let's heat things up.<eos> Let's keep America guessing.<eos> Come on, nobody is guessing.<eos> That boy is going for Grace.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, you don't...
That her?<eos> That's Dr. Wells?<eos> Yep.<eos> She's hot.<eos> Yep.<eos> So you and her were...<eos> For a summer.<eos> A neurosurgeon and a cop.<eos> How did that work out?<eos> It didn't.
They're in the foreign service in Nigeria.<eos> This is friendly, okay?<eos> No lawyer in tow.<eos> Find something to jog his memory.<eos> This is all their social media, isn't it?<eos> All their texts, photos, posts.<eos> You're rebuilding the night from everything they posted on the Internet.<eos> This is what we do here.<eos> People have no idea the trail of information they expose to the world.<eos> Some of us do.
What?<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> I'll take the floor.<eos> You can't sleep on the floor.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
I need you to save Sophia.<eos> You need to do this for me.<eos> Too many people have died because of me.<eos> It has to be this way.<eos> No.<eos> The only way I can forgive you for what you did is to save Sophia.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone with him.<eos> Sounds like you're left without a choice.<eos> I love him, Tommy.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, I...<eos> I guess, I...<eos> It's just gonna take some time.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Kent is out.<eos> It's not him we want to see.<eos> We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
And your point?<eos> Then you pretended to have information about her sister so she'd actually go through with it.<eos> Who said I was pretending?<eos> - You know about this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, so much for never letting anything happen to her, Tommy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So much for staying neutral.<eos> For God's sake, Catherine, if you have information about that girl's sister, you have to let her know.<eos> Do I?
Fuck you!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> What else did you do in afterschool?<eos> I drew a cat and a magic banjo.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is that cat playing the magic banjo? No!<eos> She's eating pasghetti.<eos> - Why didn't you bring it home?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Of course you do.
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really wanted you to have this opportunity.<eos> And yet I have received no "Thank you" Card, No tickets to ballet, no invitation to any gala.<eos> I know it's not ideal, but your donation has to remain anonymous.<eos> I'm left out in cold, like shabby child with nose pressed up against glass of bakery, longing for single bite.<eos> I'm sorry, Sergei.<eos> It's just for now.<eos> I know you understand that.<eos> I do, but...
Just tell me, 'cause I'll stop.<eos> I-I'll get out of here and leave you alone.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> So, tell me...<eos> What do you do?<eos> I dance.<eos> What else do you do?<eos> That's it, really.<eos> There's got to be more to you than this place.<eos> What do you...
That is very special, yummy, Thanksgiving cranberry sauce.<eos> Very yummy.<eos> It's smelly pig butt.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Let's talk about tomorrow, okay?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.

So, after the first penchÃ in the second pas, if you could really help me get some lift on those low leg crosses, that'd be great.<eos> Can do.<eos> Must you wriggle?<eos> And on your mincy promenade thing, do you want my hand here?<eos> No.<eos> Palm to palm, fingers on my wrist.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Right.<eos> I know that.<eos> I do.
Ed, I'm sure he's fine.<eos> We just need to get up there.<eos> He might not wanna come with us.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> Then what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't thought of that yet.<eos> Look, I just know when we get there you don't talk about doctors, or clinics, or anything like that.<eos> Do you understand? - Why?<eos> - Because just don't!
Alan is sitting on the world's biggest firecracker and they're about to light the match, so I really wouldn't... turn up my nose at a little human kindness right now.<eos> If you want to be kind... You'll respect my privacy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Party at my place?<eos> Are you sure you want to send them away?<eos> The last thing I need in my house is six giddy women and their deviled eggs.<eos> I'm assuming that's off the record.<eos> The gantry is moving away from the rocket as we anticipate the countdown at any moment now.<eos> - You don't smoke.<eos> - Today I do.
In a way.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Not really.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, what were you actually doing?<eos> You're just climbing up some bloody mountain.<eos> Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.<eos> I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> No. I didn't.
And you?<eos> And we're all good guys, too.<eos> Put it down, Ricky! Put it down!<eos> You know what, don't.<eos> Seriously?<eos> He has a gun,<eos> - a pointed gun. - He's not a killer.<eos> Well, you know, he has... killed.<eos> So technically... Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> It sort of does.
Okay, promise you'll take care of me if I have a heart attack or get gang-raped or something.<eos> Of course. I'm a nurse.<eos> I'll take care of you, and I'll be gang-raping you. I'll be the one doing it.<eos> - Okay. - You're in a safe place.<eos> As long as we're doing something together, right?<eos> Yes. Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.<eos> Mmm! I just did Molly.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You didn't actually swallow it, did you?<eos> I did.
Reggie, he knows too many things about us.<eos> He knows too many things about us? Right.<eos> Albie, do you know things about us, mate?<eos> Do you know things?<eos> About Ron, about me, about the firm, right?<eos> You know about payments, right?<eos> You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?<eos> D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em look fucking favourably upon us, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
- What are you trying to say?<eos> - Nothing...<eos> No, you just said it. You just fucking said it.<eos> You come in here with your fucking nose, right, and your tea.<eos> Your fucking exotic tea.<eos> Right?<eos> And you say that.<eos> I'm not very good at my job.<eos> - I didn't mean it like that.<eos> - You fucking did!
This matter of yours...<eos> - I'll deal with it for you. All right?<eos> - All right.<eos> You go with Teddy, right, and you bring me £2,000, OK?<eos> And in return, I promise that I will have George Cornell killed.<eos> All right?<eos> - I didn't say...<eos> - All right?<eos> I didn't say anything about killing, Ron.<eos> You fucking did.
He'll still be your brother in prison.<eos> No.<eos> No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right? He belongs with us.<eos> He belongs with you, me and his family, this is his home, all right?<eos> I've been looking after Ron since we were little boys, it's just the way it is.<eos> You can still look after him in prison.<eos> And he doesn't belong here and you know it.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
No.<eos> No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?

He would tell Katya he wants to... hey, Katya...<eos> What is it that you do now exactly, Katya?<eos> Conflict evaluation and analysis.<eos> Forget that.<eos> He don't wanna tell anyone he wants to do that.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Is he hitting on you? Watch out.<eos> He always hits on the new ones.<eos> I know that.<eos> We all do.
Ask her.<eos> Maybe she's got a photo of him in her wallet.<eos> Have you got one of Sarah's?<eos> - What do you care?<eos> - You didn't before.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - You didn't. - Did you look in my wallet?<eos> That's not the point right now.<eos> The point is whether or not you had one.<eos> - And you didn't.
You hid that you had a girlfriend from me.<eos> I never hid anything from you.<eos> It just never came up.<eos> I never said I didn't have a girlfriend.<eos> - I talked to you about my boyfriend.<eos> - Non-stop.<eos> - I left him for you.<eos> - Nobody asked you to.<eos> Did I ask you to leave him?<eos> Did I?
Here.<eos> Here is a picture of my girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, I have a girlfriend.<eos> Here.<eos> Go ahead and tell the world I have a girlfriend.<eos> Who wants to see a picture of my girlfriend?<eos> - Is she naked?<eos> - No, she's not naked.<eos> Normal people don't carry naked photos of their girlfriend.<eos> Damir does.
B, tell Damir to get over here.<eos> Oprostite.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's our fault.<eos> Tell him the road was closed.<eos> We couldn't make it back last night.<eos> And Nikola behaved very well.<eos> Tell him... that Nikola took us to his house in Dukovo.<eos> He asks if boy went into the house.<eos> No, he didn't.
Don't call me that.<eos> - What happened to your eye?<eos> Oh, that.<eos> I was attacked by a figgy pudding whilst having spontaneous sexual intercourse.<eos> What?<eos> (CYRUS) Ho, ho, ho!<eos> Cyrus, you need to sleep it off.<eos> I don't need to do dick, Muhammad Ali.<eos> - You're ruining Christmas.<eos> - Liam already did that.
They're so mistrustful of male authority figures. It'll take some time before they report these things to you and not me.<eos> Come.<eos> Mr. Featherstone.<eos> Been a regular for months now.<eos> The navigator on the Colonial Dawn.<eos> Finest on the island, so he says.<eos> He's all right.<eos> Go on.<eos> Put my tongue in his bum, he'd tell me anything.<eos> So I did and he did.
Had you gotten to this before us I don't think we'd be having this conversation.<eos> And you wouldn't do the same?<eos> I'm not like you, Evan.<eos> I don't own a gun, I don't shoot people.<eos> I sure as hell don't bend the rules for my own convenience.<eos> Untie him, Belly.<eos> I don't want him to kick me.<eos> He won't. He kicks, I shoot.<eos> He knows that.<eos> Don't you, Evan?
No one reads books anymore.<eos> - I like them.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> I just wish we weren't the only ones.<eos> If your aunt had a mustache, she'd be your uncle.<eos> Come again.<eos> It's just something my mom says.<eos> "Understanding Your Dreams." That's a good book.<eos> - I get nightmares.<eos> - So does my daughter.
If you can't see that I might as well be banging my head against a brick wall.<eos> David, what do you want from me?<eos> If you told me not to go, that you'd leave Jane...<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> And there lies the problem.<eos> You can, you just won't.<eos> It's Jane.<eos> - Here's fine. - David...<eos> I said here's fine.<eos> - David, I do...
Who chose those teams? Who chose them?<eos> Oh, you little rat.<eos> Oh, you little dickens, you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been coming here.<eos> Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
I'll head inland, take a look around.<eos> Do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> This what it was like when you came for me at Arctic Biosystems?<eos> They'd cleaned up most of the mess by the time we got there.<eos> No, not the mess.<eos> This... feeling.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Oh, more brilliance from your brilliant professor?<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you found someone so brilliant.<eos> Oh, go like that. You've got a little sarcasm.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Anyway,<eos> Evita would like to interview you. Really?<eos> She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?<eos> - Well, of course she does.

Not only are Lennox and I on good terms, but she canceled that stupid trip to Colombia.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Tell me how.<eos> Well...<eos> First...<eos> You're gonna rinse... Your dishes off every time before you put them in the dishwasher.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Come here. - You want to go upstairs?<eos> - I do.
What an idiot.<eos> Shit, man. The Blue Star.<eos> - What?<eos> -The Blue Star, you know.<eos> What about it?<eos> I can'! get it out of my head.<eos> That arsehole running it into the ground.<eos> You could make good money with that place.<eos> People don't have money.<eos> Sure they do.
Right now?<eos> I've been thinking that this place could do with a shop like that.<eos> There's lots of kids looking to clean out their dads' wallets.<eos> And?<eos> I don'!<eos> have the time to look after a store like that.<eos> I need a partner. This place is full of half-wits.<eos> But you're smart. I respect you.<eos> Your old man was from East Germany. You know German.<eos> No I don't.
You got him into it.<eos> Remember what I said? I said: cobra you're an idiot.<eos> Everything has its limits, but you don't know any limits.<eos> Don't tell me you don't remember.<eos> Cobra, tell me you remember how I gave you a good hiding.<eos> That's right. I remember.<eos> He gave me a proper hiding.<eos> Then it was your drinking mates who got him into it.<eos> - I don't have any "mates".<eos> -Yes you do!
-Hi.<eos> You upset? What's it look like?<eos> - What? -What's it look like?<eos> - Come with us. -come with us.<eos> Come have a drink. We're going to a dance. - No.<eos> -come on.<eos> - I'm in my (racksuit.<eos> -Doesn't matter.<eos> - I don't have any money.<eos> -I do.
Vaccines are on their way.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll do that.<eos> You go home and rest.<eos> You're the one who should be resting.<eos> ~ I left you in a terrible position.<eos> ~ No, you didn't.<eos> You were ill.<eos> ~ You may not understand that, but...<eos> ~ I do.
Who is it? You don't recognize it?<eos> Once in a bad mood I painted this monster.<eos> As a self-portrait.<eos> But no one could figure out what it is.<eos> Marek... Let's see you look at it! Who is it?<eos> Daddy!<eos> Don't underestimate the kids.<eos> It's dangerous to lie to them.<eos> - You had children so early?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- It was probably you, John.<eos> - Yes, you go through it.<eos> - Hurts my lungs to laugh.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> And the boy videos - your family would enjoy Frisky Pool Party 7.<eos> That's right!<eos> Tim, the car isn't yours.<eos> No, but I need it.<eos> John told Lois that you had to have a scan.<eos> Did he, now?
Yet I hired him to do the job.<eos> Well, Ava, I figure what's mine is yours, what's yours is mine, so I... thought I'd just do it myself.<eos> Besides, all that's left is to paint.<eos> - I can get to that tomorrow.<eos> - Then what?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - I got to wake up.<eos> Do you want a coke or a coffee?<eos> - Well, you got a cold beer?<eos> - I do.
I know we don't want to rush things, but we don't have a couple of years to let things unfold in their natural course.<eos> Reagan wants to turn Afghanistan into our Vietnam, and if that happens...<eos> About Paige...<eos> The Centre takes very seriously what you said to them about staying away from her.<eos> Good.<eos> But if that's the plan, they also want to know, this isn't just, uh, sitting still, is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is very difficult.<eos> Do they not understand that she is 14 years old?<eos> Of course they do.
Apparently nobody under 30 looks a day over 12 down there.<eos> I've got someone that can help you with that.<eos> I know this girl--well, technically she's a man now, But he's great.<eos> Oh, god, this is insane.<eos> So keep the bush.<eos> I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
But I agree.<eos> I agree.<eos> Don't take any chances.<eos> The exterminator comes in one hour.<eos> I am going to stay at my cousin's in Riverdale.<eos> When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
Of course not.<eos> [sighs] That's good.<eos> You know what? I... I'm actually...<eos> I'm just gonna tell you some things about me because I'm not really sure you've been paying attention.<eos> So I am the type of guy that likes to play bad music with his buddies at the bar around the corner.<eos> I'm someone who actually enjoys listening to the J Train as it's rattling outside my window because I know that it's filled with all kinds of wonderful people that are just living their lives.<eos> I like smoggy sunsets, I like smoking pot, and I would much rather experience the world than read about it in some book.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know that.<eos> Do you?
Well, isn't East Berlin getting rather...<eos> Oh, yes, the place is getting complicated.<eos> Yeah, complicated.<eos> The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors, and it hasn't worked.<eos> We have intelligence to suggest that they may go one step further and wall off the entire Eastern sector.<eos> Okay, that's it in a nutshell.<eos> The decision is entirely yours.<eos> You need time to kick it around.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't. Well, fine.
- There's my favorite guy.<eos> -(GASPS) Patty!<eos> My favorite White House social secretary!<eos> (CHUCKLES) - Did you hear about the centerpieces?<eos> - I did. I heard you sent them back to centerpiece hell.<eos> I know. We felt they weren't right.<eos> So this is coming from the President?<eos> It's coming from us.<eos> And the painting, she wants that swapped out, too?<eos> Yes, we do.
- When's Catherine's birthday?<eos> - June 8th.<eos> -9th.<eos> -9th.<eos> - Which senator's daughter is in rehab?<eos> - You're out of line, missy.<eos> - Geldray.<eos> - What are you wearing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do.
It's the only time I can think straight, you know, without the phones and screens pestering me.<eos> You okay, ma'am?<eos> You look a little flushed.<eos> - I mentioned the moment in the car.<eos> -(GASPS) - And? - He had no idea what I was talking about.<eos> - No, you're kidding me.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?<eos> - I'm so humiliated.<eos> - Okay, I understand. I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.

- Are you having fun?<eos> - So much fun.<eos> - What kind of wood is this table?<eos> - I don't know. Let me check.<eos> - I think it's ash.<eos> Uh-uh. - I'm gonna redo my kitchen.<eos> Ma'am, you think you want to think about this right now?<eos> Yeah, sure. I mean, we've got time.<eos> - We've got an hour.<eos> - Do we?
They're bringing the journalist out.<eos> - Is he a friend of yours?<eos> - Leon?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> He is the asshole of an asshole's asshole.<eos> I feel bad for the guys who had to guard him.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Leon.<eos> A face I never thought I'd want to kiss.<eos> - I still don't.
Jonah, we need to talk.<eos> We are just in the car with Leon West's mother.<eos> Do you need anything, ma'am?<eos> No, I'm good. Thank you.<eos> Great.<eos> Jonah, I know something's happening at the VP's office.<eos> Oh. Okay, you do.<eos> I need you to tell me what's going on.<eos> And, uh, do I have to tell you that right now?<eos> Yes, you do.
- Shh. Pennsylvania called for O'Brien.<eos> Oh, no way!<eos> - I said we should have gone back there.<eos> - And you were right.<eos> - Why did you ever resign?<eos> - It's hard to understand.<eos> I think Pennsylvania is the real significant call tonight.<eos> Pennsylvania, you had that as a Meyer win, is that right, Matty?<eos> ( stammering ) Yeah, uh... yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
How do you lose a whole person?<eos> A cuff link I get, but not a person.<eos> Okay. She said she's losing her voice.<eos> Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> She said you fucked up, Ben.<eos> And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit. You need to get him out.<eos> - She didn't say that, Gary.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Are you sure we're ready for this?<eos> Completely, yeah.<eos> Hurry, let's get in there.<eos> Hi, hi, we're really late.<eos> It should be under One Up Him, but if it's not...<eos> Matheson or Murray.<eos> Hey, did you remember to put the new build on the iPads?<eos> Uh, yeah, did I?<eos> Fuck, did I?<eos> Did you?
If I weren't married, I suppose... but, Russ, as your business manager,<eos> I need to tell you something, and you're not going to like it. At all.<eos> ♪ ♪ Dinesh: So, what's the plan here, Richard?<eos> We're not gonna, like, fight them, right?<eos> Uh... No, no. I don't...<eos> I just... I mean, we got to do something.<eos> Even if it's just yelling at them... telling them that they're not gonna get away with this.<eos> But you know they are, right?<eos> Well, not if I have anything to do about it.<eos> But you sort of don't.
No, no, no. He's confused.<eos> He's Chinese. He's talking about this crack-addict prostitute we saw at the gas station. She was smoking cigarettes.<eos> So sad.<eos> Jian-Yang, what're you doing?<eos> This is Palo Alto. People are lunatics about smoking here.<eos> We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
No.<eos> No more pain.<eos> That's right.<eos> Very sleepy, Ivar.<eos> You're getting very sleepy.<eos> There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
If she needs me, she will tell me.<eos> She is a woman, not a child.<eos> Good night.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> I'm not a fool, Helga.<eos> Something happened here when we were away.<eos> Something happened that led to the death of Siggy.<eos> Even Ragnar knows that.<eos> But he doesn't know what happened.<eos> And you do, don't you, Helga?
We are going to fight together, even though he took away all that was mine.<eos> All that was ours.<eos> Perhaps it was fated?<eos> And perhaps it is fated that I shall win it back some day.<eos> Lagertha.<eos> I see you are making yourself comfortable here as well.<eos> I have come to join with King Ragnar and you in the attack on Paris.<eos> Whatever else divides us, that simple fact unites us all.<eos> We will fight and perhaps, who knows, we will die together.<eos> And if we don't?
Let's get this thing going. Whoo-hoo!<eos> Why did you say "great"?<eos> - Well, you said "great." - only because you said it.<eos> If i don't say "great" after you say "great," Suddenly i'm the bad guy.<eos> And may i just point out-- not in a judgmental way-- None of this would have happened If you hadn't forced him to read the bloody thing.<eos> This is all of your making.<eos> - We don't want him in it, do we?<eos> - You're really asking me that?<eos> No.<eos> Do you?
Give me some credit.<eos> I swear on my little swastika tattoo, this is nothing personal.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Merc Lapidus?<eos> I'm telling you, he said he can't do it without you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - I talked to the man myself.<eos> Well, I don't care. No fucking way.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Obviously, you don't, 'cause if you did...
Why would you do that?<eos> What were you thinking, Lucy?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Terrence knows about us.<eos> He came home drunk last night talking all sorts of shit, and I don't know.<eos> But don't worry, he ain't going to say nothing.<eos> I think you've had enough.<eos> Don't you think you've fucking had enough?<eos> - No.<eos> - I do.
Maybe you're right. But we need to stay cool.<eos> Think about Owens and the prostitution scandal.<eos> That was less than a year ago.<eos> This is Louisiana.<eos> Owens was re-elected.<eos> We're not going to be in November.<eos> Colin is a white congressman in a black district.<eos> He can barely win here with nothing hanging over him.<eos> That's why the Senate made sense, where there are at least white voters.<eos> Still does.
And listen to this holly jolly classic.<eos> Little shit.<eos> Will, where are you?<eos> Hey, whoa, what is it?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where is he, Will!<eos> There you are.<eos> Baby, don't, don't!<eos> Did you open those presents?<eos> Did you?
- Well, we're as good as.<eos> The only reason we're not is because the sheriff's busy.<eos> If he wasn't busy, he'd probably drag us right out onto Main Street, slit our throats.<eos> - Ethan is not Pope.<eos> He's not gonna do that.<eos> - You're probably right.<eos> - He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> - Franklin! You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid.<eos> You think this guy's going to let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- how's my park doing?<eos> - Great.<eos> We're up two and a half percent over last year.<eos> A bit lower than our initial prediction.<eos> No, no, no, how's it doing?<eos> Are the guests having fun?<eos> Are the animals enjoying life?<eos> Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.<eos> We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.<eos> Sure you do.
Can she see us?<eos> They say it can sense thermal radiation.<eos> Like snakes.<eos> I thought there were two of them.<eos> There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.<eos> Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
- Man, I can't, I can't.<eos> - You have to do it.<eos> There's no other way.<eos> Send him back to Hell.<eos> Do it!<eos> - Brotherhood of Steel, dude.<eos> Brotherhood of Steel forever.<eos> - I don't know, I just...<eos> I can't stand mic cupping.<eos> - Cannibal Corpse do it.
I know what she felt.<eos> I understand the entire psychological situation.<eos> She shouldn't have talked to me that way.<eos> She shouldn't have kids.<eos> That's not for you to say.<eos> Ah, Jesus, I can't even agree with you.<eos> I don't hate kids.<eos> Look, you got to a certain point in your life and it didn't happen.<eos> I understand you're angry about it, but you've got a lot of other things.<eos> - Don't do that.
I think you're lovely, and I hope your life turns out just as you imagine.<eos> Wanna go for a drive?<eos> I thought we agreed we weren't going anywhere until you wrote.<eos> The rate I'm going...<eos> Let's go for a drive.<eos> I'd like to stop at a church.<eos> Okay.<eos> I prayed that God might forgive me for all the horrible things I said when we knew.<eos> And I prayed for the strength to mean it.<eos> Because I don't.
This was the meaningful act I was searching for.<eos> You can't just take it upon yourself to take someone's life.<eos> Well, I thought it was a very reasonable thing to do.<eos> She hoped he'd get cancer!<eos> But what the hell is hoping?<eos> Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
It's the girls.<eos> Stay with me. Come on, come on, wake up, darling.<eos> Come on, come on. Can you hear me, darling? Can you hear me?<eos> Come on, please, please... Wake up, open your eyes.<eos> Open your eyes, please, darling. Please, come on...<eos> Please, open your eyes, darling, come on, come on...<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> ~ Please, come on... ~ No. ~ Please...<eos> Mercy, mercy, mercy...<eos> Don't.
Hello. Only to find it is their own doom they have pronounced...<eos> King's Cross, please.<eos> Because my mother is much closer to being put in a home...<eos> - Got your purse?<eos> - Yes.<eos> .-.Than Miss Shepherd.<eos> I do miss your dad.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> I asked our Gordon, when he was a pilot, did he go behind the clouds?<eos> - Did he?
She just liked their company.<eos> Felt more herself, I think.<eos> Get drunk with teenage lads, go skinny-dipping, whatever.<eos> Anyway, one of the mums found out, thought it were inappropriate, complained.<eos> How did your dad feel about it all?<eos> Honestly?<eos> It were all too much for him.<eos> He tried to kill himself.<eos> He thinks I don't know that.<eos> But I do.
Be he fat or be he lean.<eos> With my last leg standing next to me, I should still wrestle with the urges to fight or flee.<eos> It's called "terminal restlessness".<eos> The body fills with adrenaline and feels compelled to go-go-go.<eos> "Go-go-go"?<eos> I've already got up and gone.<eos> This is posthumous.<eos> You're not dead yet, Abel.<eos> You still have to eat.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, yes.<eos> And you are making them tastier.<eos> And I you.<eos> Imagine what you must taste like.<eos> Won't be long until someone's taking a bite out of you.<eos> You're becoming brighter, Abel.<eos> Dying hasn't dulled you one bit.<eos> The snails are certainly having a lovely experience, fattened on me in a red-wine marinade.<eos> They have no idea they're going to be eaten.<eos> We do.
What else is happening in our relationship together,<eos> I can't do it anymore.<eos> You're talking about the intimacy.<eos> Yes, I'm talking about the intimacy.<eos> I can't do it anymore, Desi.<eos> It's not working for me.<eos> I'm not supposed to be someone's mistress.<eos> Nobody thinks of you as a mistress, Marn.<eos> But because nobody thinks about me at all, like, in relation to you.<eos> I do.
I had sympathy because I knew you had a problem, but you're sober and you're still pulling this shit.<eos> What are you trying to provoke?<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't even want to-<eos> - I don't want to know.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I don't need any more friends.<eos> Oh, so none is enough for you?<eos> Adam, I do.
We're about to know whether you're the real deal or a one-trick pony.<eos> Oh, what? You're gonna say, my psychic friend here says you're a murderer.<eos> Sign this confession? Nope.<eos> Won't need to.<eos> When he sees this photo, his reaction will let us know how psychic you really are.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Frost.<eos> Oh. Happy to! Who do I make it out to?<eos> Seattle Police Department.<eos> I take it you know her.<eos> I don't.
That you have already eaten.<eos> Here's your paan.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> Kashi, there's someone else...<eos> So the rumours are true.<eos> What rumours?<eos> That the Peshwa's caught the evil eye.<eos> Never mind the rumours...<eos> I don't believe in superstitions.<eos> But I do...
You knew?<eos> Dr. Jordan, I'm sorry, but we live on an island that's 400 miles from the nearest fast food joint.<eos> We've got no convenience stores, no antidepressants, no World Wide Web.<eos> We're completely self-sufficient and we take care of our own, which is why I'm not very good at asking for help. But... I'm doing that now.<eos> Dr. Farragut, if we give you our complete cooperation, do you think you can find this disease, get rid of it?<eos> We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
Could he have passed the illness on to Soren, or vice versa?<eos> Children are never alone with the adults.<eos> The children are never alone.<eos> Come. I want to show you something.<eos> What, uh... What did you want to show me?<eos> What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
Soren, he, uh... he must have liked something sweet every in while? Candy?<eos> We don't allow that here.<eos> 'Cause he had something sweet<eos> - right before he got sick.<eos> - You must be mistaken.<eos> - The blood tests prove it.<eos> - I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
Please, I need to talk to you.<eos> You're trying to judge me, trying to blind me to my path.<eos> - Please, just hear me out.<eos> - I used to know people like you, people who thought they were better than me.<eos> But Michael's opened my eyes so I can be free of your judgment.<eos> I just thought you deserved to know the truth.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's Soren's bear.<eos> You said he took it with him.<eos> He did.
I heard screaming.<eos> What's going on up there?<eos> There are a lot more sick people now.<eos> The CDC doctors are locking everyone in the refectory.<eos> Monsters.<eos> I just hope they don't do to them what they did to my Soren.<eos> Truth is no one knows what they're doing.<eos> You may be in the safest place - They had no right to punish me.<eos> Doesn't Michael say that the true path - is always righteous?<eos> - That, he does.
It's the only explanation.<eos> Half the bowls were spiked, probably with contaminated honey.<eos> The only question is who had access?<eos> Hello, Peter.<eos> Are you ready to talk?<eos> There's been a new outbreak, and I know you'd like to help your friends.<eos> They're struggling without their leader.<eos> Then let me out so I can help them.<eos> In good time, provided you help me.<eos> And how do I do that?
They're not looking to profit in the short term.<eos> It's about restoring balance for the future.<eos> The board believes that-<eos> The board!<eos> Julia, do you hear yourself?<eos> I'm doing everything in my power to change this, Sarah.<eos> Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization?<eos> Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate, just until resources are replenished.<eos> You think you know better, but you don't have the right to make that choice.<eos> No one does.
He also said that no politician should ever let his picture be taken in a bathing suit.<eos> Well, that's what he said.<eos> And if I tell you, Carlos... that what I want, sincerely... is to help the poor people of this country... do you believe me or what?<eos> Pablo held most of his campaign rallies in the poorest neighborhoods of his electoral district.<eos> He placed himself on the side of the poor and the weak in the fight against the oligarchs, "The Men of Always."<eos> And just like any politician, he made plenty of promises.<eos> Only difference was Pablo had the men and the money to back them up.<eos> It was becoming clear to everyone that Pablo was gonna win.<eos> Pablo! The only question remaining was...<eos> what to do about that.
He was going to kill them, one by one, until he got Marta Ochoa back.<eos> Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could hide in the jungle and wait it out.<eos> Sooner or later, he figured the narcos would cave in.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> M-19 didn't stand a chance.<eos> "Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound... or your family is next."<eos> Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please! Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
Tell her to stop.<eos> His reverie shattered,<eos> Hector took solace in the clarity of his life's limits and in knowing that his few transgressions existed only in his dreams.<eos> Hey.<eos> You asleep?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stay right there. I'll be right back.<eos> You said 30 minutes.<eos> Adam, let me play. Look, you turned it off.<eos> No, you did.
He's gonna go to jail.<eos> You know what, Hugo?<eos> People should never ever let their feelings get out of control.<eos> Yeah, for example, when you were struck out in the game, yeah, normally that's when another player is allowed to...<eos> Harry, I explained the rules to him. - You don't have to.<eos> - Yeah, that's not your place.<eos> I don't think Harry is trying...<eos> Let him speak for himself.<eos> I had no right to hit you, Hugo.<eos> - No, you didn't.
And what's this about worst birthday ever?<eos> I mean, your birthday doesn't officially start until 11:48 PM, which it happens to be right now.<eos> Hey, Tom, hit it.<eos> You didn't leave?<eos> There's nothing wrong with Stan's school.<eos> She'd never let me move.<eos> Who's gonna invest in a broken-down ambulance that serves wine?<eos> Hey. Oh, come on, babe, you know it's true.<eos> Junebug, we don't have a cousin named Pootie.<eos> No one does.
It is fact.<eos> Our Packs are a reflection of our leadership.<eos> And your leadership is weak.<eos> You want to make an example of Malcolm?<eos> We need to make an example of you.<eos> An Alpha cannot show his throat like this.<eos> Is not personal, is politics.<eos> There's nothing more personal than politics.<eos> You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death.<eos> And if I don't?
You're not fine.<eos> It's only been three days since...<eos> You can't ignore your grief.<eos> You have to deal with Philip's death.<eos> Jorge dealt with it.<eos> Jorge dealt with covering it up.<eos> And that's done.<eos> But Phillip's sister has been texting me ever since.<eos> As far as his family knows, his car crashed on the way to the airport and they assume I have nothing to do with it.<eos> You didn't.
You are off the clock, my friend.<eos> You find him.<eos> You find Malcolm and you kill him.<eos> For our fathers.<eos> Logan: You find Rachel?<eos> No, and I shouldn't be calling you without Jeremy knowing, but we've got a possible lead on Malcolm.<eos> Where?<eos> Look, there's no guarantee that Malcolm has Rachel, okay?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course he does.
You... you heard those witches.<eos> That guy that came after Malcolm...<eos> She-she was in that house.<eos> I mean, if he wanted a werewolf, maybe, maybe... maybe he took her.<eos> If we're going to believe the witches, we have to believe what they say, that he wants Malcolm.<eos> You're asking me to give up hope.<eos> I'm asking you to brace yourself for the worst.<eos> You would've made a great dad, Logan.<eos> You need to heal.<eos> We all do.
No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> It's a couple hundred miles between the two possible locations.<eos> We have no choice but to split up.<eos> Clay, you and Paige go in one car, the rest of us will go in the other.<eos> When are you going to tell Paige the truth?<eos> That Aleister is your son.<eos> I've hardly been able to admit that to myself.<eos> He shouldn't have survived.<eos> But he did.
I can just... feel her.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> I don't want anything bad to happen to her.<eos> Elena has no influence on you.<eos> You will forget what she said.<eos> She is no longer in your mind.<eos> They want to control me.<eos> If you tear your bed apart, you'll just have to sleep on the floor.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
Where can I take you for breakfast?<eos> I want fried chicken.<eos> Fried chicken it is.<eos> I saw London just before she left for the party.<eos> What time was that?<eos> Around 8:00 P.M.<eos> She was so excited.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to wish her a Happy Birthday.<eos> I thought I'd see her at the party.<eos> Did you?
I don't hate her.<eos> Is that all you heard?<eos> You're cheating yourself.<eos> That tiny apartment.<eos> I don't want to make plans, but we could get a place in the mountains or the country, or a place in the mountains and the country.<eos> Have you been looking for a place?<eos> It's a hobby.<eos> I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you to let yourself have a future with me.<eos> Do you want to get married? Sure.<eos> If you do.
All right, Willy. Let's go get our family.<eos> Do you want a hit off that first?<eos> Nice.<eos> Let's go, little buddy.<eos> I know it's good hash.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't fucking think so.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Ricky, we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did.
We can't drink back at the park.<eos> I know, but Jim's got something planned, and I said I would... okay.<eos> All right.<eos> But before I go, a toast to us.<eos> Whatever you've been doing at the spa, just keep it up.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - [electronic chimes]<eos> - Oh, my sweet tits! I won!<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
I'm not retired.<eos> A good soldier never deserts on a mission and this mission is not over.<eos> What exactly is the mission, bud?<eos> If you don't know, I can't tell you.<eos> You drunken sot.<eos> Ricky, aren't you afraid someone's going to find all these weeds plants out here?<eos> No one's going to be out this fucking way any time soon.<eos> This is where people say they saw the Saskatchawaunch.<eos> Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did.
If you don't know, I can't tell you.<eos> You drunken sot.<eos> Ricky, aren't you afraid someone's going to find all these weeds plants out here?<eos> No one's going to be out this fucking way any time soon.<eos> This is where people say they saw the Saskatchawaunch.<eos> Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did.<eos> It's probably a stupid bear or a dumb gorillna.<eos> Saskatchawaunches don't exist.<eos> Yeah, but what if they do?
And then my mom, she said that grief is like a suitcase that sits at the bottom of your bed.<eos> And no matter what, without fail, you have it pick it up every day, take it with you.<eos> Some days, it will be filled with rocks, and you won't think you can carry it.<eos> And then other days... Light as a feather.<eos> That, she said, is "getting through it."<eos> It made sense to me.<eos> My husband was killed three months ago in a plane crash.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said I knew what you were going through.<eos> I don't.
- You attacked him. - Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> If Danny stays, what is he going to do here?<eos> I don't know. We'll have to figure something out.<eos> We are, or you'll just decide?<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
Oh that place is famous for its sweets get us a Kilo or two when you go there next time.<eos> so you are going to take us...where is your license<eos> What license? driving license/P - ya I have...<eos> Check if the taxi has a carrier or not.<eos> And keep both the suitcase in the front seat if there is no place... Where is it?<eos> L-lad I known there'll be so much of luggage, I would've got a mini bus.<eos> Do you have any medical issue?<eos> eye sight..?<eos> night b_BAR_indness..? day blindness? Glassesf?<eos> - Dad. do all this later.
First discovered on the moon.<eos> Apollo 11 mission.<eos> You sure? - Yeah.<eos> I couldn't believe it, so I ran it again.<eos> The same results.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> They sprinkled that stuff around the ship because they knew we would test it.<eos> I'm seriously impressed.<eos> - Guys, we have no answers.<eos> So, what do we do?
But these things happen.<eos> Not in my family.<eos> Yeah, that'll be good.<eos> Eight o'clock's good.<eos> - Sally, it'll wait till morning.<eos> - Okay. Talk to you then.<eos> Bungalow 3's got that leak again.<eos> We're gonna have to replace some floorboards.<eos> I thought we fixed the AC in that unit.<eos> Oh, we did.
I'm done with him.<eos> Maybe it'll be better this way.<eos> Maybe it will.<eos> What happens tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow? You meet me at 10 a.m. Sharp, okay?<eos> I can't do this thing in my boat.<eos> I can't be seen doing that. Gotta borrow one.<eos> Okay? So we have, like, a very small window. Are you listening?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - To do this thing, all right?
What do you got in there?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Empty it. It --<eos> Now.<eos> Looks like a burner.<eos> Phone you don't want to be traced.<eos> Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I-I-I don't know. I mean, I-I --<eos> Answer the question. Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I don't -
Okay.<eos> Look, you know I have to make the call.<eos> Vega's file says that her next-of-kin is an aunt in Tampa.<eos> Did she ever mention anyone else?<eos> It's her father's sister.<eos> She's the only living relative as far as I know. Okay.<eos> All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is Kimball Cho.<eos> I'm with the FBI in Austin.<eos> Yes, uh, it's about Michelle.<eos> Is there any more coffee?<eos> Uh, actually, I think we're out. I'll -<eos> - I'll make some more tea.<eos> No. No, that's okay. I'm fine.<eos> You don't believe in the afterlife at all, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.

Have you been?<eos> No. I hear it's big.<eos> Huge. Yeah.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
I get tired but I'm okay.<eos> There's something different about you from the last time we talked.<eos> You look lighter... less conflicted.<eos> Number three -- you saw it, found an answer, huh?<eos> The number three is incredibly common, Gabriel.<eos> We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
It has never reoccurred.<eos> And doctors say, with the medication I take, It never will.<eos> But it wasn't on your medical records when you applied For search and rescue here, was it?<eos> Look, there is no connection between me leaving the army And Stoddart getting killed.<eos> None.<eos> Well, the DNA test will give us a result, And either it will be your son's blood<eos> And you'll be released to pursue a, uh, wrongful arrest And assault charge against sheriff Anderssen, Or it will be stoddart's blood<eos> And you'll be charged with his murder. Well, DNA doesn't lie, does it?<eos> You're right.<eos> It never does.
I don't know what's in the sheriff's mind.<eos> Are you afraid to talk about this?<eos> No.<eos> Are you frightened to talk to me?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship With sheriff Anderssen.<eos> So, she doesn't.
What the fuck is this thing, Jules?<eos> Where the fuck did he get it?<eos> I've changed my mind. I don't want you here.<eos> You think he killed Stoddart.<eos> You can't accept what he did because you know it's your fault.<eos> It's a receipt for something he shot on the glacier that he wanted prepared.<eos> It's here somewhere.<eos> Did Pettigrew ever talk about why he was here?<eos> He might've done.<eos> Well, did he or didn't he?
You listen carefully.<eos> If you don't cooperate, you'll be charged for confinement and assault on Moon.<eos> What'll it be?<eos> I just got in.<eos> See the light on the ceiling?<eos> - The light.<eos> - Pardon?<eos> Okay!<eos> Got it!<eos> You did?
May I see Miss Angelique?<eos> But of course.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> I trust you shan't be disappointed.<eos> I'm sure not.<eos> Be firm with her.<eos> She is willful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you bought.<eos> I do.
Mr. Chandler?<eos> Lupus Dei. He shall be your challenge, daughter.<eos> I want to know who did this to you.<eos> Get better, Mr. Roper.<eos> We have much to talk about.<eos> My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Mr. Chandler felt you needed to know.<eos> "For thee are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies... but against mighty powers in this dark realm."<eos> "And against evil spirits in heavenly places."<eos> So these Nightcomers practice a form of black magic, while you practice a form of...<eos> Practicing any form of magic is unbelievable enough, do we need to parse it?<eos> We need to know what these things are.<eos> Yes, they're witches, understood.<eos> Witchcraft has a long history in many cultures, Doctor, as well you know.<eos> As do fairies and sprites, but they don't walk about - Greater London, do they?<eos> - These do.
He took... "<eos> Took what?<eos> Aren't you all dying to know?<eos> It's a story.<eos> A narrative that continues.<eos> Language to language.<eos> Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic to 10 other obscure languages and pictographs, changing language from relic to relic. Is it the story of Lucifer, then? The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
Go on, my dear.<eos> "He took us by our winged backs and raised us over His head.<eos> Thence did he fling us from his Heavenly Throne and... and cast us down, to Earth and to Hell.<eos> So we were..."<eos> Damned?<eos> At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Thank you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Oh, it's fantastic, Malcolm.<eos> I wanted her to succeed here tonight. I...<eos> Be still your heart, Doctor.<eos> This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
Sneak up and cut his throat? Is that what you're gonna do?<eos> You do that and you won't be able to stop.<eos> So stop now!<eos> I'll stop when his soul is burning, like hers was.<eos> Go on, then. Do what you fucking want.<eos> I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
When you have seen that of which you are capable when you have stood in blood long enough what is there left but to wade to a desolate shore away from all others?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you?<eos> Where is your shore?<eos> There is no place far enough.<eos> I have lost the immortal part of myself, you see.<eos> No, I've thrown it away.<eos> No matter how far you have walked from God he is still waiting ahead.<eos> You don't believe in God.<eos> But you do.
No need to impress me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not here.<eos> This will just take a moment, Sarah.<eos> You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
Oh... What's happening?<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't run any more, I'm so sleepy.<eos> Oh, no, please, I have to rest for just a minute.<eos> Toto? Where's Toto?<eos> "Look at this. I'm overwhelmed.<eos> "All these kind words. "They've made up for what has been a truly rubbish day, so thank you,<eos> "and there's to be an election to take my place.<eos> "Now, come on, Pagford, "did you think I wouldn't have something to say about this?<eos> "Of course I do.
♪ I drop more rhymes than... ♪ ♪ gonorrhea ♪<eos> I don't know.<eos> Rap is really hard.<eos> Seeing my dad look lonely makes me realize how good people are in pairs.<eos> Feels like I'm about to hear your latest, totally unnecessary obsession.<eos> My dad needs a best buddy.<eos> And there it is.<eos> Look, Jules, not everybody needs to have people around - all the time.<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Everyone does, except for maybe serial killers.
I wondered where this had gone.<eos> Half this stuff is mine.<eos> There's more.<eos> You want to trust me with this?<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> After the anointing of the alphas will be the final seal of our...<eos> Gia, you don't have to do this.<eos> Sorry, but I do.
Who was that?<eos> - Someone I met once.<eos> - Cute.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's your pager, dumbo.<eos> I can't...<eos> It's Sean.<eos> He wants you to meet him.<eos> He says you know where?<eos> I do.
Making a master suite with our bare hands.<eos> And now it's here and I have nothing to do with it.<eos> Okay, Hannah, I understand this is about your pain and your devastation, totally, and I'm gonna get you a hot cup of tea for that like in just a mo, but am I the only one who doesn't know about this?<eos> We loved each other, Shosh.<eos> We loved each other, and nothing has changed, okay?<eos> I'm the same person I was when he loved me.<eos> In fact, I'm an arguably better person because I went away and figured out what I want.<eos> Hannah, we are going to get through this.<eos> - I want to die.<eos> - No, you don't.
I couldn't be...<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, um... is Adam here, or...?<eos> No,it'sjustus.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, Ray.<eos> So I guess you know what's going on.<eos> I do.
I really am.<eos> Uh, yeah, that's 'cause you completely disappeared.<eos> No, I've just...<eos> I've been juggling a lot.<eos> Desi moved in, which is exciting, and we've had a lot of nibbles from this label, but, honestly, I think I've actually just been avoiding you because I have no idea how to say what I need to say to you.<eos> Great, are you, uh, breaking up with me, too?<eos> No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause you completely disappeared.<eos> No, I've just...<eos> I've been juggling a lot.<eos> Desi moved in, which is exciting, and we've had a lot of nibbles from this label, but, honestly, I think I've actually just been avoiding you because I have no idea how to say what I need to say to you.<eos> Great, are you, uh, breaking up with me, too?<eos> No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'll handle it.<eos> When do you think you can move in?<eos> I know we need to get a bigger place so your kids have somewhere to sleep when they visit.<eos> I know that's what we talked about.<eos> _ _<eos> - Because of the club?<eos> - Because of everything.<eos> Angie, the club being closed means my money is tight.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> Yeah, but Tasha does.
'Cause it's really a long time.<eos> I know.<eos> Wait, does that mean that she is the only girl you've ever had sex with?<eos> What?<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Wait, uh, can I ask you a personal question?<eos> When you've been seeing somebody for that many years, is the sex still any good or is it, like, pretty boring?<eos> Don't even ask me that, please. I...<eos> There's no way to...<eos> Just don't.
- Do you straighten it?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> This one's for you, Dan.<eos> Oh, yes. Whoo!<eos> I don't know this song at all.<eos> I don't.
- You know the Bible, I see.<eos> - The opiate of the masses?<eos> You know what happens next after that verse you cited?<eos> "There was nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine.<eos> And forthwith, Jesus sent the demons into the swine.<eos> And the herd ran violently into the sea, and they drowned in the waters."<eos> (CACKLES) Yeah.<eos> Poor little piggies.<eos> But I like that very much.<eos> - You do?
Hardly ever see her anymore!<eos> Christina.<eos> Christina got some decent mommy skills.<eos> Maybe she can take care of the baby for a little while.<eos> She's in junior high. So what?<eos> Junior high will still be there!<eos> Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good. It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
Oh, no! Oh, my God!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Leanne.<eos> I didn't... Keep my name out of your fucking mouth, you fucking half-breed.<eos> Hope you enjoy hell.<eos> Yeah, she no good at apologies.<eos> I thought you might be hungry.<eos> What if someone sees?<eos> The elders are already out of line.<eos> Shunning is for guiding people back to the church. But you didn't turn your back on the church.<eos> I did worse.
- Yeah. Uh, hey, I'm Charlie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> New here. So, uh... They told me to tell you that we need to take the van into town to the hardware store, and I'm gonna go with you, if that's okay.<eos> I mean, obviously, it's all right, because I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not used to giving orders.<eos> All right. I can help you through that.<eos> You got the keys to the van?<eos> - The keys?<eos> No. - You don't?
No one calls me that.<eos> And Danny in the Lion's Den sounds like the name of a picture book for slow home-schooled kids.<eos> Joe, he's my dad.<eos> And he's wrong.<eos> You need to stand up to him, tell him that. He's gonna respect you for it.<eos> If he doesn't, he's your dad, he's still gonna love you.<eos> Man, you know nothing about wasps.<eos> Maybe you need to bust out the eggs again, like in the old days.<eos> Norma doesn't need that voodoo shit.<eos> Well, maybe she does.
Now, hang up and do nothing!<eos> - Sam Keating was first reported missing...<eos> - God!<eos> Can you knock next time?<eos> I just talked to Frank.<eos> He said we're being watched,<eos> - so it's important we don't freak out.<eos> - Too late for this one.<eos> - What did he say about Annalise?<eos> - Uh, he didn't.
Do you have a forwarding address?<eos> No, thankfully, or I'd have to mail back his security deposit.<eos> He didn't try to get it back?<eos> No, not after the cops carted him off.<eos> - He was arrested?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ask your girlfriend.<eos> She's the one who called the police that night.<eos> - You said you didn't know him.<eos> - Because I didn't.
You're still talking.<eos> And you both have your heads up your asses.<eos> She's telling us to act normal when she's the one who needs to act...<eos> Will you two stop?<eos> Her husband was just found murdered.<eos> She should be grieving instead of blowing off the cops and taking on mobster drug dealers who she cares more about than saving us.<eos> Mr. Walsh.<eos> My office.<eos> I-I didn't mean any of that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Look.<eos> - Why's it doing that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I know.<eos> You jump out and run around, and I'll scoot over and be like, "Hurry, get in!"<eos> Okay.<eos> One, two, three, go!<eos> That was awesome!<eos> There's a lot of stuff back here.<eos> - What do I do? - What?
Evacuate everyone.<eos> No.<eos> Those 27 kids... They're linked by magic.<eos> The rule of three can find them anywhere.<eos> So we got to protect them from here.<eos> A Faraday cage.<eos> It's, like, a container that energy can't get into or out of. Right.<eos> It protects everything inside from an electrical charge.<eos> We don't have time to construct something like that.<eos> Somebody already did.
Alcohol has its own rules.<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> What do you think is so important that we had to have dinner tonight?<eos> I'm getting something.<eos> I have a very strong sense that this is the night they announce their retirement.<eos> I've been wondering the same thing.<eos> Of course, I'm not psychic.<eos> Oh, honey, you don't know that.<eos> No. I do.
What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - No, what are you doing here?<eos> - You mean in my house?<eos> - This is my house, too.<eos> Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but when Robert told me we were going in on this place together, I made him promise we would never have to be here at the same time.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because I had Sol actually write that into the contract.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Where is he?<eos> - Welcome.<eos> There he is.<eos> See those two birds?<eos> Behind Jesus?<eos> I don't see Jesus.<eos> But that's the general direction.<eos> They look like they really love each other, don't they?<eos> - Do birds mate for life?<eos> - No one does.
It'd be a crazy coincidence otherwise.<eos> I can see what you're thinking right now, but please don't freak out about this.<eos> I'd just love to know what's what, and what you're doing on a hook-up site.<eos> If Rompford is on Grindr, that means Rompford was on Grindr within the last few hours.<eos> I went on because I wanted to know who else was in the building.<eos> - Why? - Why?<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Because I was bored waiting for you.<eos> Who doesn't want to know what other homos are lurking in the shadows?<eos> You don't do that?
- Hey. Are you... Are you ready to go?<eos> Yeah, just... Just give me a minute.<eos> Patrick, I don't want what Jon and I had.<eos> Ever. I don't want to go back there again.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Good. It's just... it's just all the lying and the feeling guilty and shitty.<eos> Yeah. That's just so not what I want.<eos> - Good. We want the same thing. - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Yes, that's it. That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - What the fuck is this thing?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> When Jake and Milo came by earlier, did they give you the skinny on the sex party?<eos> Is that why you wanted to go down there?<eos> Can you put little Ted down, please?<eos> He's very fragile.<eos> He's already lost an eye.<eos> No, they didn't.
- You know?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And I want to get through this now.<eos> Okay, can we?<eos> Because I cannot do this.<eos> - I can't handle it. I really can't. - Yeah.<eos> This has been like going through the worst fucking break-up that I've ever been through.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> But we do kind of need to break up, Dor.<eos> We do.
I think...<eos> In fact I don't accept this.<eos> Accept what?<eos> Never seeing you.<eos> You're the busy one.<eos> No...<eos> I'm free.<eos> I work like a madwoman but I find time.<eos> - Both of us have to want it.<eos> - I do.
The less I understand her, the more I love her.<eos> And the more I think of you.<eos> Don't feel like talking?<eos> Let's get some fresh air.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Dancing.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> What?<eos> - Don't want to go?<eos> - I do.
Hey, dykes!<eos> You don't like my bush?<eos> What's his beef?<eos> What's your problem, asshole?<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Asshole.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't see a thing.<eos> I think he killed me.<eos> - He didn't.
Walking in here looking like a little bitch?<eos> Get over here.<eos> Lucious, no! Lucious!<eos> Lucious!<eos> Take your pills.<eos> He's always loved them more than me.<eos> Even Jamal, who he hates.<eos> You know he's gonna leave it all to Hakeem, don't you?<eos> And Jamal won't object, because he's too passive.<eos> But what if he did?
You want a fucking name?<eos> How about a fucking name?<eos> You know what you're going to get from me?<eos> Me, you and him are gonna have a little sit down, a little chit-chat about what's really fucking going on.<eos> Who the fuck is him?<eos> I got eight dates a day!<eos> Just tell me...<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> You didn't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Just relax.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> A lot of assumptions are being made that I'm here to clear up.<eos> Mr. Lexington and I were on a working retreat when the photos published in this tabloid were taken.<eos> My sexual orientation has no bearing on his.<eos> There is no relationship of any kind other than professional.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How you doing?
Well, if my man said that to me, I'd be angry, too.<eos> We don't fight that much anymore.<eos> After 31 years of stalemates, girl, it just is not worth it.<eos> I wouldn't put up with it.<eos> His money became your money the minute he said, "I do."<eos> So I'd give it to my sister anyway.<eos> I don't even like my sister.<eos> Just be careful, Elizabeth.<eos> You do not want World War III to break out in your home.<eos> No. No, I don't.
So, what does a normal week in your life look like?<eos> Well, my son drops in for an hour or two during the week.<eos> I go grocery shopping, an occasional doctor's visit, and my girlfriends and I get together on Friday afternoons for coffee.<eos> Other than that, I read a lot and I spend time with Jesus.<eos> I used to spend so much time with my girlfriends before my job...<eos> Give me your money right now.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Both of you, give it to me now.<eos> Okay. Okay, we will. Just please, put the knife down.<eos> Do it, and do it now!
Squatting some with Jeremy and those kids.<eos> All right.<eos> Yo, wait.<eos> He ain't allowed inside.<eos> Relax, Dais, neither am I.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So where's Coke at?<eos> I thought you got her again.<eos> Shit.<eos> I did. But then my damn probation officer...
What happened to you?<eos> What happened?<eos> Hey, baby...<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> -Later.<eos> -Wait, wait.<eos> What was that?<eos> Annoying is what it was, I mean, Princeton, Yale, who gives a shit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who does?
It's...<eos> It's true...<eos> Glory is losing her one on one, and...<eos> They...<eos> They...<eos> They made strides.<eos> She can be a lot more than she is if you give her a chance.<eos> If Glory isn't enrolled in your school this fall, do you wanna be wondering a year from now what happened to this little girl?<eos> Don't you wanna make a difference in her life?<eos> Yes, I do.
She was just a mate I lost touch with.<eos> Did she like that Michael, then?<eos> Only, she never said.<eos> And you're gonna put all this in a statement for me, aren't you?<eos> - On paper.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Might even bring my driving licence down, huh?<eos> Do we believe him?<eos> He didn't take advantage of her fancying him?<eos> I do, actually.
So am I.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> Promise.<eos> I shouldn't have to take 15 phone calls in the middle of the night because you approve an E.C.M.O. in the field!<eos> - Wait.<eos> It needed to be done.<eos> - I don't even know what to say.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that costs?<eos> Yes.<eos> And yet you did it anyway!
- I do know that, too.<eos> - And I'm in with these wonderful people.<eos> And why not say I have a body issue?<eos> I just say...<eos> You just say the words, you know?<eos> - What's the issue? - Yeah.<eos> I have an abnormally small dick.<eos> - I have an abnormally small dick!<eos> - Okay, uh-huh. - Sweetheart...<eos> - I do.
Indeed.<eos> Gentlemen, please.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We are getting away with this.<eos> Are you trying to get caught?<eos> I'm doing what we set out to do.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to keep making money, don't you?<eos> You want to keep living that privileged life of yours.<eos> Yes, of course I do.
And all of you will be treated however I see fit until you learn to submit to your king.<eos> Where I come from, bloodlines matter.<eos> Convince your cousin to come to his senses.<eos> You have a lot at stake.<eos> Berthold.<eos> I believe our business here is done.<eos> Good evening, Mr. Adams.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Didn't mean to startle you.<eos> You didn't.
You!<eos> I'm talking to you!<eos> Get up, come on.<eos> Get up!<eos> Please spare me.<eos> Rajiv, do you have a clear shot?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Check carefully.<eos> Do you have a clear shot?<eos> I do, sir.
Those you talked to don't know me well.<eos> 10 years, Siya!<eos> It's been 10 years!<eos> Can't you forget the past and forgive me?<eos> 10 years!<eos> ls that enough time to forgive my mother's murderer?<eos> For God's sake, Siya.<eos> I didn't kill your mother!<eos> And you know the truth.<eos> - Of course I do.
Anna writes for magazines and Tricia is dedicated to caring for children.<eos> We do not have to talk.<eos> List?<eos> We'll be back in an hour.<eos> He is making his second cycle of chemotherapy.<eos> It is very weak.<eos> Do you think it will get better?<eos> At the moment I do not think so.<eos> At first he said he did not want to study medicine.<eos> Well, I did but I did not.
If it were now, I wouldn't make us stop.<eos> We'd run right by.<eos> And I would have shot that woman dead.<eos> Right or wrong.<eos> We need to stop.<eos> You can be out here too long.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> This is my house.<eos> You don't want to go in there.<eos> Yes, I do.
- No.<eos> Okay. How about you just talk to me?<eos> I never thought she was alive.<eos> I just didn't. After Daddy, I don't know if I couldn't.<eos> And after what Daryl said, I hoped she was out there, alive.<eos> And then finding out that she was and then she wasn't in the same day...<eos> Seeing her like that, it-- made it feel like none of it was ever really there.<eos> Before... this was just the dark part and...<eos> I don't know if I want to fight it anymore.<eos> You do.
Glenn, Tara, Noah?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Aiden. You met Nicholas pulling gate duty.<eos> - Hey. - You're Deanna's son?<eos> That's right. I hear you got experience making supply runs.<eos> I saw your pantry.<eos> You guys seem to do pretty well.<eos> Yeah, well, had some training before this.<eos> Rotc. Was nearing lieutenant when this shit blew in.<eos> - My dad did rotc.
I'm gonna try.<eos> You're Rick.<eos> Rick, this is my husband reg.<eos> You're a pretty remarkable guy.<eos> How's that?<eos> I watched the tapes. All of them.<eos> The things those people said about you.<eos> The things you did for them.<eos> Didn't you build that wall out there?<eos> Yeah, I did, with help.
Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bless her heart. I don't get what takes her so long.<eos> I mean, we only have one copy and the point of book club is that we all read the book.<eos> I just keep hoping that a dentist shows up at our gates. - It's his teeth.<eos> - I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.<eos> Sasha, honey, what's your favorite meal?<eos> I'd love to cook it for you sometime.<eos> I'm doing it for all the new arrivals. - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
Give it another second.<eos> It's a big place.<eos> There could be some inside.<eos> So let's say they are.<eos> Let's move. Let's be safe. All right.<eos> Okay, let's move.<eos> - Yeah? - You got it? - I got this aisle.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Dad, get off!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it right now.<eos> You touch them again and i'll kill you.<eos> Damn it, rick! I said stop.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
Thoughts?<eos> Everything gets a return.<eos> - Are you shitting me? - No, I shit you not.<eos> I like this.<eos> Just talking.<eos> I don't get to meet new people very often.<eos> Maybe once every two weeks.<eos> - That's a lot.<eos> - Oh, I work at it.<eos> We do.
You've sent people away?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was early on.<eos> It was three people.<eos> Two men and a woman.<eos> Davidson was their leader.<eos> Smart as hell, strong.<eos> I thought they'd work out.<eos> They didn't.
Why's that?<eos> Because you believe me.<eos> That family kidnapped themselves.<eos> All right, I believe you.<eos> I knew it. I knew it.<eos> Finally, someone believes me.<eos> - Why do you believe me?<eos> - I heard the details.<eos> - Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.
I knew it. I knew it.<eos> Finally, someone believes me.<eos> - Why do you believe me?<eos> - I heard the details.<eos> - Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving.<eos> How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
I've seen all the coverage. And I have to say I think these memos are fake.<eos> You...?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I do not believe Jerry Killian wrote those memos.<eos> Sir, when we spoke on... September 6th... I'm sorry, I'm just going through my notes.<eos> When we spoke, you said the content of the memos was familiar to you.<eos> - Is that correct?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And that they reflected Colonel Killian's mind-set at the time.<eos> And they do.
You didn't prove Ben Barnes got the president into the Guard. You didn't prove the memos are real.<eos> The burden of proof is on you.<eos> By that standard, The Times would never have run the Pentagon Papers.<eos> The Post wouldn't have listened to Deep Throat...<eos> - Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat.<eos> - He's confessed to abusing his power... to keep some of the richest, privileged sons of Texas... from getting their asses blown off in Vietnam.<eos> Ms. Mapes.<eos> Don't you think it's possible, just possible... that some of those fine, young... "privileged men, as you call them... got into the National Guard on their own merit?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, I do not.
I mean, I get a few of these letters every once in a while, but so does everybody.<eos> Is there anyone else you can think of?<eos> There's this guy who works at my coffee shop, letterhead coffee, right across the street from me.<eos> He's this tall, hipster-nerd type.<eos> He's always asking me a bunch of questions, but he seems pretty harmless.<eos> Corey something.<eos> I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I don't know yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, um, I...<eos> I'll see you around, Collins.<eos> Yeah, see you around, whatever your name is.<eos> Jamie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - ♪ Gravity gets us... ♪ - You know I'm a cop, right?<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> Equally fun.<eos> Yeah. [ chuckles ] so, i'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-i've never done that ever, and i'm very sorry.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> It was close. It was really close.<eos> You know, i almost couldn't explain it away.<eos> But you did it.
Yeah.<eos> Apparently, it went viral.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> Does Steve know you're here?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
they're safe.<eos> You know I had to do it.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> I know that.<eos> Gail, he was right here.<eos> We could have put that guy away, but now... now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
Get over here.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - It's actually tradition.<eos> It's a superstition.<eos> Look, I'm gonna take boo for a walk and then take him to the sitter's, okay?<eos> Uh, you have like 40 minutes to get ready and get out of here.<eos> Also, don't forget that Oliver's taking you, all right?<eos> Traci's gonna take me.<eos> Uh, do you have the music on your phone?<eos> I do.
You know, one time, I had a bride show up on a Saturday when the wedding was actually on a Sunday.<eos> That's pretty weird.<eos> Mm-hmm. She's gonna be here.<eos> Uh, the wedding's in, uh, 10... 10 minutes.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know the girl.<eos> She's probably working on one of her lists.<eos> She wants everything to be perfect before she walks through the door.<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Plus, I'll be there with you, so people will already assume you're cool.<eos> What do cool people do?<eos> They have a secret handshake.<eos> Does that mean we're gonna have a secret handshake?<eos> Fuck yeah, we are.<eos> The decision was decided by me earlier today.<eos> Do it.<eos> Go.<eos> - No.<eos> - Do it.
- I'd like to question her.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> It is...<eos> Necessary. Whatever you need.<eos> After you, Rachel.<eos> Holy doodle, here we go.<eos> Oi, oi, Rachel.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Never gets old, does it?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Wonderful.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> There's plenty of food for everyone.<eos> You got to form a line.<eos> Please, don't push.<eos> I'm Dr. Gallinger from the Knickerbocker Hospital.<eos> Here to see Dr. John Thackery.<eos> Patient.<eos> I'm sorry, we have no patient here by that name.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.<eos> But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.<eos> When I first moved to America,<eos> Howard was my only friend.<eos> She made me feel so welcome in her home.<eos> Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.<eos> Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.<eos> (chuckles) She did that to me, too.
Well, however much money your father was giving you, I'll give you more.<eos> Thank you, Mummy, I love you!<eos> (quietly): Helicopters for everybody!<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> LEONARD: I don't think this is gonna work.<eos> Just let me see.<eos> Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.<eos> A: surprised you know that. B:<eos> I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you. Oh.<eos> Well, you do. Oh.
Like this.<eos> And I...<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> If it takes them longer, then eat that apple.<eos> Don't stay hungry.<eos> Stop the bus!<eos> No, no, no, no! You can't leave this child here.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Her parents will come here to file a complaint, right?<eos> And what if they don't?
Did anybody here say "arrest"? No.<eos> You wanna walk, walk.<eos> But I gotta say, I expected more cooperation from you on this.<eos> Cop to cop.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Fine.<eos> What lawyer?<eos> Ehrmantraut, who's got him and where?<eos> That way.<eos> Hey, fellas, how you doing?
He's not my prisoner.<eos> No?<eos> What is he?<eos> We're allies.<eos> You fucking traitor.<eos> You fight for the crows now?<eos> I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
and says, "Ignore that.<eos> It was a long time ago"?<eos> I got nothing to show her.<eos> Who cares about her?<eos> You should see what she does.<eos> It's so sensual.<eos> Get your camera.<eos> Why?<eos> I want you to take my picture.<eos> No, you don't.
So, piggy bank, you getting mad yet?<eos> You getting mad?<eos> Do your thing. - Ooh! - Oh!<eos> Oh, really. That's a little hard, Mr. Policeman.<eos> Mr. Tough guy, huh?<eos> I don't want to play that.<eos> ♪There's a time for living ♪ ♪Time keeps on flying ♪<eos> ♪Think you're loving, baby ♪ ♪But all you're doing is crying ♪<eos> ♪Can you feel ♪ ♪Are those feelings real?<eos> How you doing?
Is Freddie that boy who works in the canteen?<eos> Oh, I know. Oh, my God!<eos> Way out of my league.<eos> And he lives with me now.<eos> I lived with Karl, but he moved out, and Freddie got thrown out of India House, so he moved in.<eos> Just when I've got a chastity belt.<eos> I'm lickin' the walls.<eos> He looks nice, though, he looks really nice. Hashtag, get naked!<eos> Yeah, no-one says ' "hashtag'" out loud, not any more.<eos> They do.
The essay?<eos> - Just as comparison.<eos> Could I?<eos> - I've got to go, she's been sick all down herself. Haven't you?<eos> Erm... yeah, OK.<eos> Look at you, all down your nice clean top.<eos> - Molly, would it kill you to help? - I sort of need it now. Oh...<eos> Look, Cleo... if there's something I need to know, then you should tell me.<eos> Now, tell your Uncle Henry, that tone doesn't work with me, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
The whole street was bent.<eos> The boy next door, he's a woman called Gala now.<eos> - Like gala pie? - That's what I said.<eos> But does she listen?<eos> Gala Pie Jones.<eos> Scotty works for Vanessa.<eos> I run a cleaner's. We do all the city centre flats. High-end, Coronation Street and all that.<eos> Scrubbers to the stars, that's us. Thanks.<eos> I've got the Sunday morning shift.<eos> We do police work too, all the deep-cleaning at murder scenes.
I was scared of the man.<eos> All my life I've been scared of the man.<eos> Send it.<eos> Oh, you little fucking...<eos> CAMERA CLICKS What's that for?<eos> I'd better head off.<eos> There's this bloke at work. I think he's interested.<eos> - I might give it a go.<eos> - You don't need to tell me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Early days.<eos> Might be nothing.<eos> But he's mad, he's completely mad.<eos> God, I'd forgotten how mad men can be. And...<eos> I mean, he's insane.<eos> But I think there's a chance.<eos> Are... Are you actually going out?<eos> We're sort of... circling.<eos> But he wants more, I think.<eos> I do.
Temporary shelter I can offer ye, but I'll no put my family or myself in jeopardy.<eos> I can pay you.<eos> I wouldn't ask your men to risk their lives for nothing.<eos> A half dozen or so would give us a fighting chance.<eos> A dozen would give us an even better chance.<eos> Where did you get these, woman?<eos> Fraser, ye say your name was?<eos> That's right.<eos> My husband gave them to me on our wedding night, they're yours, if you'll help us.<eos> Did he indeed?
They're cutting me loose.<eos> The judge gave you probation, and when you break it, you're gonna be right back here.<eos> You're an addict and a punk.<eos> When you get in trouble, you're gonna need help.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> 'Cause your boy raped and killed.<eos> He's going away. You want me?<eos> Is that why you keep coming after me?<eos> I can look like a boy if you want. I can let you call me Greg.<eos> He didn't do it.
How do you create a formula to be 100 percent sure that the armies attack at the same time?<eos> Uh, you can't.<eos> Well, there's always be some uncertainty, it's a trick question, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna walk the rest of you...<eos> - Wow, never woulda thought Jesus' sister would turn out to be a math whiz.<eos> Was that even a math question?<eos> And please tell me you know I'm nothing like my brother.<eos> No,<eos> I do.
- I respect that, you know that I do.<eos> But we have to demonstrate that we're academically on par with the other schools in the system.<eos> So we're meant to teach to the test now?<eos> Is that it?<eos> And where does it stop?<eos> Are we about to get a list of banned books?<eos> Don't be hyperbolic.<eos> This doesn't sound like you at all, Lena.<eos> I thought you had final say when it came to academics here.<eos> - I do.
- No, I think you're awesome.<eos> It's me I wonder about sometimes.<eos> Come on, nerd, walk me to band practice.<eos> So how'd it go?<eos> With Timothy?<eos> Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
It can't just stop there.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> There must be more.<eos> We're still brothers.<eos> We still have the same father.<eos> Right, Gabriel?<eos> It makes complete sense.<eos> I've always said that we couldn't be brothers.<eos> We look nothing like each other.<eos> Yes, we do.
- You have room for me?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - What about Gabriel?<eos> - He never liked storytime.<eos> He prefers to read alone.<eos> - Start the interpretation now, Joseph.<eos> - Thank you, Franz.<eos> If we could travel back in time and let the ice age descend upon us the outcome would probably be different.<eos> Species, genus, breeds die out not for a reason.<eos> They just do.
Motherfucker don't suspect a thing, man.<eos> Ghost think he got that white boy in pocket like he always does.<eos> Tommy'll bring him to the spot.<eos> We'll take him out just like they did Breeze back in the day.<eos> You'll get rid of the body.<eos> We'll have the whole crew meet, tell 'em how everything gonna roll with Lobos.<eos> So I ain't comin' to the meeting?<eos> Sure, we'll still be there when you get back.<eos> I need you to reach out to the Serb, Ruiz, and Drifty, and explain to 'em Tommy on our side now.<eos> Ghost did him just like he did me.
You dinna ken what you're saying.<eos> But I do.<eos> That day... That day when Randall came here, when he took me upstairs...<eos> If I hadn't mocked him that way, if I... if I'd given him what he wanted he wouldn't have treated you like he did.<eos> And then father... mo chridhe, no.<eos> Don't.<eos> I did anger Randall at Fort William, and I've spent the past four years of my life blaming myself for father's death because of it.<eos> But now ye know better?<eos> Aye.<eos> Hmm. Aye, I do.
And then i get -- you guys have to come and tell me this.<eos> That's what i get.<eos> Are they gonna arrest me?<eos> Brother, they're gonna bury you.<eos> [ voice breaking ] they're gonna try.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I want you to give this to jarvis for me.<eos> No!<eos> Oliver, don't, okay?
You got to believe me.<eos> I didn't... I didn't want to hurt anybody.<eos> I was gonna come cl... come clean after.<eos> But then... then I found out what Alonso did to Ted, and this just...<eos> Alonso killed Ted McDonald?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.
Yeah, well, me too.<eos> [ rock music playing ] You thought about where you'd go if you had a choice?<eos> Yeah, back in time 9 1/2 months.<eos> You?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I kind of liked working intelligence with mario.<eos> Sorry to bring her up.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, i really don't.
I wanted to be part of the family.<eos> But i had a job to do.<eos> So, after everything that it cost you, You're okay with the choices you made?<eos> Here's what i do know --<eos> I can live with myself.<eos> I can look in the mirror and still see me.<eos> And sometimes that's all you can hope for.<eos> [ footsteps depart ] [ door opens ] bill: Gail. They're ready for you.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, And nothing but the truth, so help you god?<eos> I do.
Murder isn't part of the pattern, Andy.<eos> Nor was killing people across the street.<eos> Something bad happened this morning.<eos> Maybe our home invaders are looking to do... another robbery right away and close up shop.<eos> - Mike may be right.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> Jim Norton just left a florist carrying a vase and two dozen roses.<eos> You don't buy roses two weeks<eos> - before you're going to deliver them, either.<eos> - No, you don't.
Hotels over here.<eos> Woodrow Wilson High School.<eos> Shopping mall. ‭ - Wait a second.<eos> What? What was it?<eos> Got a Woodrow Wilson High School.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Woodrow Wilson High School. That's where he's hiding.<eos> All due respect, professor, how you know that?<eos> I just do.
Told you I'd win our bet.<eos> John is already so hammered.<eos> He had way too much champagne.<eos> No, no.<eos> Thanks again. I thought a Batman-themed Bar Mitzvah was tacky, but this really can't compare.<eos> It was his idea.<eos> Well, we were gonna have it at the strip club, but that food is terrible.<eos> Yeah, well, congratulations to you.<eos> I hope you'll both be very happy and have a good lawyer.<eos> - But we do.
I'm sorry that I walked out of dinner, but you should know the reason why.<eos> I'm having your baby.<eos> I'm gonna do this on my own, and I don't expect anything from you. Zoe!<eos> Please open up!<eos> Can-can we talk?<eos> Have you, uh, seen Zoe?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She's upstairs sleeping, if you want to wait.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wait, shrimp?<eos> Shoot.<eos> Uh, hold on a second.<eos> So, a baby, huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, that is... wonderful news.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry if I got caught off guard before.<eos> I didn't realize that you and Wade had gotten back together.<eos> We didn't.
I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Honey, I know that this is a difficult time, but it is so important that you know, from the bottom of my heart,<eos> I will never, ever be called Grandma.<eos> Hey. Nice ruffles.<eos> Yeah, the things we do for love.<eos> Yep!<eos> The things we do.<eos> So how'd it go last night?<eos> Well, it didn't.
If he thinks he can stop us, he's going to need a lot more men.<eos> This area is off-limits.<eos> Riley. It's me.<eos> Will...<eos> Are you real?<eos> Left. Go left.<eos> I'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here.<eos> - We have to wake her up.<eos> - How? I don't know.<eos> I do.

Yeah, thanks.<eos> Didn't hear you come in.<eos> Yeah, it was late, and I didn't want to wake you.<eos> What did Cornell want this time?<eos> Just... More questions, and...<eos> I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
- Well, cheers, mate.<eos> I'm touched. - Weapons down!<eos> Get in!<eos> Les anglais.<eos> What did she say, Julia?<eos> Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
That's hardcore, but this is really good.<eos> Yeah, I have.<eos> Do you remember how much fun it was, like, a few seconds ago... and now that you said that, it's all tight in the chest and scary?<eos> So are you glad that you said that now, about moving in together?<eos> Okay, so what, are we supposed to never say anything scary?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Why?<eos> Because scary is fun-ruining, and I like fun.<eos> Do you like fun?<eos> No, I don't.
- Hey, how you doing, man?<eos> Good. Good.<eos> So Howard's got you looking after Chuck, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a few extra bucks, you know?<eos> - How's he doing?<eos> Seems okay, like usual.<eos> I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're waiting on paperwork at the office.<eos> - You know how it is.<eos> - Don't I though?
- Thank you.<eos> - After you.<eos> So... we start over.<eos> As though we meet for the first time. Hm?<eos> Please.<eos> - Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
- I feel really good, like we cracked it. - I guess so.<eos> Oh, I was feeling so angry at you, but I feel like you're really supporting my tenure now.<eos> I am, I do, of course.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Of us, even.<eos> Get a load of those two, the dread on their faces?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do? - Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?<eos> My dad would kill me, okay?<eos> I'll see you at school tomorrow.<eos> Sorry, Miss Gallagher.<eos> Don't embarrass me like that.<eos> Embarrass you? Hey.<eos> Go.<eos> Brush your teeth, now. You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> Why not?<eos> You do.
In case you didn't notice, my place is crawling with cops.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> You better protect yourself.<eos> I am protecting all of us.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> How's Layla?<eos> She O.D.'d on pills, Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I saw you give them to her.<eos> Yeah. I did.
When you don't have that in your life [Inhales deeply] It can make a person pretty crazy.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> Well, I can't tell you that, but personally, I do tend to lean towards the devil I know.<eos> ♪ been about 20 days check, please.<eos> ♪ Since you said to me, "no, I ain't in love" ♪ ♪ No, I ain't in love tough man to get ahold of.<eos> I've been busy putting my life back together after your ex-wife got me fired.<eos> Sorry if returning your calls isn't a priority.<eos> Look, look, I was backed into a corner.<eos> I didn't know what she was gonna do.<eos> So, how you doing?
And I got it bad, all right?<eos> I got it real bad.<eos> Fact is, I got me a daughter who says she hates not seeing me, and she's about to get a whole lot of that.<eos> - No...<eos> - And I'm not gonna see her either, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
I don't have time to fight, Rayna.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Just wanted to let you know that my lawyers are preparing to file an emergency injunction against you tomorrow, stripping you of your parental rights, seeing as how Deacon is Maddie's biological father.<eos> You... you can't do this.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> I want that contract nullified.<eos> Yeah, but Maddie is my daughter.<eos> You think I want to explode our family?<eos> You think I want to break her heart into a million pieces?<eos> I do not.
What?<eos> Ever since you left, you've been calling me every hour, on the hour, asking me if I'm okay.<eos> I'm good.<eos> My god, when did you get so paranoid?<eos> Juliette, I'm not paranoid.<eos> I... I just... I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Sorry I've been so short with you today.<eos> I just didn't want you to think I was the whiny, needy wife at home.<eos> I don't.

- 'Cause I'm so tired.<eos> After all that talking last night with the girls, and I'm throwing Juliette's baby shower today.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Well, at least the girls finally dozed off.<eos> You want me to move 'em upstairs into their room?<eos> No, no, no, no, that'll wake 'em up.<eos> This way, they'll sleep for hours.<eos> I knew it's gonna be tough telling' them, but...<eos> God, Maddie took it hard.<eos> They both did.
- The Triple Exes!<eos> - This is ridiculous. We...<eos> Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are the Triple Exes, and usually there are three of us here, but the third party is about to become a daddy any second now, so he couldn't be here.<eos> So I guess that makes us just a couple of exes, right?<eos> Actually, before we were in a band,<eos> Scarlett and I used to perform together as a duo.<eos> I was pretty lost back then, couldn't write a song to save my life.<eos> But when the two of us got together, that all changed.<eos> Guess you could say she inspired me.<eos> Still does.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure. Uh, will is a hell of a singer.<eos> You two get to know each other.<eos> Excuse me one second.<eos> Hey, listen, I know this is last-minute, but Rayna had to bow out unexpectedly, and I was hoping you might fill in.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh... I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
It's really not fair, you know? [Chuckles]<eos> I mean, I didn't get that on-the-job trainin' that most dads get.<eos> I wasn't there for your first skinned knee or... [inhales deeply] Day you come home from school crying' 'cause... somebody said something mean to ya.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Much as we both hate this moment, I gotta admit, I love being here to have it with you.<eos> That was pretty perfect, Dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So does this mean you're not gonna tell mom?<eos> No.<eos> No, it does not.
Saw you were playin', thought I'd stop by.<eos> - Really?<eos> After all these years...<eos> - Who we got here?<eos> Oh, yeah, this is, uh, this is my father.<eos> Friends call me Bill.<eos> I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> Oh, no, call me Luke.<eos> Uh, your son tell you he's the first artist I signed to my label?<eos> No, he did not.
Now, he never once said that when I was a kid.<eos> I always knew he did until...<eos> Well, he didn't.<eos> But to hear him say it out loud...<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> How... how could you say that?<eos> He doesn't know the real you.<eos> He just knows the Will Lexington who's a rising country star, the Will Lexington who's straight now.<eos> - Nah, you don't understand.<eos> - No, I do.
George spotted one of the Welds on the property.<eos> I checked the perimeter; he's double-checking the garage.<eos> No sign of them? - No. Maybe he was mistaken.<eos> He wasn't mistaken. (loud slamming)<eos> - I'll check it.<eos> I think someone is down there.<eos> Hello, Jackson.<eos> (indistinct radio police) That's my brother. - Where have you been?<eos> I figured if I wasn't here, it'd make it easier to catch him.<eos> Which... it did.
That's how you know it's the truth.<eos> Neverett!<eos> Neverett!<eos> Lieutenant, firefighter's calling you.<eos> Neverett!<eos> What brings you slummin' around a fire?<eos> Take these back to the truck, probie.<eos> Nick D'Agostino.<eos> My brother Sam.<eos> - How you doing?
Idealistic.<eos> I feel like buying girl scout cookies from her.<eos> She's got a theory on the crime?<eos> Yeah, and I agree with her.<eos> We all think you're half right.<eos> Your childhood enemies are thieves.<eos> And arsonists.<eos> No, just thieves.<eos> And Gravely wants to catch this firebug before it kills someone.<eos> We all do.
I don't mind playing house, but as long as your mother and Kevin are away, why don't you call in sick?<eos> Let me take you to Bermuda.<eos> No.<eos> Cape Cod?<eos> I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to go.<eos> Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
- Four? What four?<eos> - Gwen... Gwen would want this.<eos> You don't know your own kids, but you know what a woman in a coma wants?<eos> There's us, Barb, and then there's you.<eos> How do you think that's gonna look to people?<eos> How do you think it's gonna look?<eos> People are already trying to blame the victim, blame our son.<eos> Do you care about that?<eos> Do you... do you care about that?<eos> No, of course you don't, b-because you never did.
~ You are a little lost.<eos> ~ If you say so. Well, when you tire of pretending to look at dresses,<eos> ~ I will buy you a drink. ~ (SIGHS) I can tell you about my plane journeys.<eos> Where I've been.<eos> Where I'm going.<eos> Perhaps you will feel a little less lost.<eos> Mademoiselle. Jacques was asking me about you.<eos> Well, I do hope you told him all about my shameful history.<eos> ~ That should put him off.<eos> ~ Actually, it didn't.
~ I'm no longer needed. ~ When?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Not that it was a real job.<eos> Working for my father's mistress.<eos> ~ She's not my mistress. ~ You could have fooled me.<eos> Nancy means a lot more to me than that.<eos> Well, I hope you told her.<eos> You used to have quite a reputation.<eos> She must know.<eos> Everyone else does.
I'd like to talk to him as well, make sure that he's happy with the excavation.<eos> ~ Can you bring him into the store?<eos> Hello.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> £15,000 into the Selfridge Estate bank account.<eos> We got our full budget.<eos> ~ That's such wonderful news.<eos> ~ I'm so happy.<eos> You and Miss Webb have a good working relationship.<eos> We do.
Previously on "Lost Girl"... Couldn't help but notice you didn't let her in on your little situation.<eos> Is this really happening?<eos> Lauren: I'm starving.<eos> Does chi-sucking always give a bad case of the munchies?<eos> You want pizza?<eos> You called for pizza half an hour ago.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Of course I do.
Don't worry, they're not gonna kill you.<eos> They think you're like fucking crime scenes' Picasso.<eos> more useful to found out about them.<eos> Why?<eos> "Know your opponent", The Art of War, Sun Tzu, chapter 3.<eos> - What the fuck you're talking about?<eos> - I'm talking about what I bring to the table.<eos> - She doesn't give up. - JULIE:<eos> You better be on your way!<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Have a seat, please.<eos> Henri came to see me this morning.<eos> Er... I've been so worried about him.<eos> He hasn't been home for three days.<eos> Why is he avoiding me?<eos> I think... because he lost control in the window, he feels ashamed.<eos> But more than that, he...<eos> he survived and his men died and he feels responsible.<eos> ~ That makes no sense.<eos> ~ But it does to him.
We have to talk.<eos> It's too late.<eos> When we argued in the window, I could have done anything - even hurt you.<eos> You must not be with me.<eos> We made a vow.<eos> In sickness and in health.<eos> So you are here out of duty.<eos> I'm here because I know what happened in Verdun.<eos> ~ I don't want to discuss it.<eos> ~ Well, I do.
Try this one.<eos> ~ Ooh! ~ I have another one you can try.<eos> Er, I... I'm so sorry.<eos> I've... ~ I've changed my mind.<eos> ~ Oh! All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> I know everyone's a bit shaken up.<eos> Oh. I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> Then don't.
Work the ER at Metro-General.<eos> A few weeks ago, cops bring in three men.<eos> Said they were robbing tourists, beating them up pretty bad.<eos> Apparently, a man in a black mask took issue with their activities and decided to step in.<eos> I counted nine broken bones between them.<eos> A few days after that, EMTs bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said... some guy she knew waited for her after work in the parking lot, attacked her...<eos> tried to drag her in the alley. She said she screamed and screamed, and a man in a black mask heard her... and he saved her life.<eos> So, yeah, word's getting around.<eos> And I want to believe in what you're doing.<eos> I really do.
It's cause it's against type.<eos> No emotions on a battlefield.<eos> Yes ma'am. No ma'am.<eos> Doubt.<eos> Kill.<eos> Repeat. You'd think by my last life I'd have this figured out.<eos> Word of advice:<eos> Sometimes it can take centuries to figure it out.<eos> When did people stop hurting you?<eos> They didn't.
I read your first article that you ever wrote. The one that made people hate you.<eos> And, like, it's so comforting to me.<eos> "Dear Beaver's Ridge, the following article has been formatted to fit your narrow and oppressed view of the universe." It is a great opening line.<eos> It's so epic.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Well, my mom died, so...<eos> Fuck and shit.<eos> Hey, you wouldn't happen to know who the wills and estates lawyer is?<eos> I do.
Please don't be mad, Hermie.<eos> You know how special you are to me.<eos> And to the judge and to that fat fellow before him and to the Spaniard before him.<eos> Yes, I have been waiting that long.<eos> Ever since you obtained a new boss, it seems harder than ever to see you. Why is that?<eos> Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"?<eos> Hmm? Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> After the swelling goes down, try to... keep it elevated and then you can go home.<eos> Excuse me one moment.<eos> Lucy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure that must have been a surprise.<eos> A pleasant one.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I know I felt more than you at one point, but I won't pretend my treatment towards you after our falling out wasn't intended to hurt you.<eos> It did.
Excellent.<eos> Well, let's get started.<eos> If you'd like to come with me, please.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Where are you taking them?<eos> The X-ray room.<eos> I want to see what bones and organs they might share.<eos> If you want them to take their clothes off, that'll cost more if that's what you want them for.<eos> No, that is not what I want them for.<eos> Many men do.
Walk away.<eos> Hope 4 U. From the airport.<eos> It's a hell of a way to solve the refugee crisis.<eos> Who's to say the living won't be next?<eos> Something that Sadie said.<eos> They are making more to keep the island running.<eos> But they'd all be fresh.<eos> The heaters are for ageing them.<eos> They could never get away with it.<eos> They did.
But, boys, next time you decide to go mud-dogging, try not to use a judge's car.<eos> More good advice.<eos> You're a genius, bro.<eos> Freaking genius.<eos> Let's give him the bumps! Oh, no. No, no, no.<eos> No bumps.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You are not giving George Tucker the bumps.<eos> Whew. Thank you.<eos> Thanks for doing this.
None taken.<eos> I'm telling you, she wants something.<eos> Oh, I just think she wants us to be happy.<eos> I mean, she knows what a hard time I've been having getting over Lavon.<eos> What's that face?<eos> What face?<eos> I didn't make a face.<eos> You made a "I know something" face.<eos> You know something!<eos> No, I don't.
I saw him at the Save Our City demo.<eos> If Greg Mathieson gets his way, this community will be demolished to make way for his high-rise monstrosity and ordinary people will not be able to afford to live here!<eos> Yeah!<eos> But today we draw a line.<eos> Scumbag!<eos> You can't keep him here.<eos> I've told you repeatedly...<eos> What are you charging him with?<eos> I'm asking you to leave quietly.<eos> He didn't do anything.
Robert - out.<eos> The girls have had a long day.<eos> And, Pattie, here's something for you.<eos> I don't need to tell you what's in this box.<eos> Oh.. it's arrived!<eos> Take a look.<eos> Oh, Robert, come on. Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
I mean look at cholera.<eos> The Black Death.<eos> Not just the disease but the social implications of the disease have literally changed the course of mankind.<eos> Think about the diversity of life on the planet.<eos> Disease in a way has formed a kind of cycle which helps to create life and uh, obviously some cases, to destroy it.<eos> Perhaps there is so much diversity in life simply for disease to exist.<eos> What if mankind's purpose is simply to exist as a host?<eos> Just a vessel. Nothing more than that.<eos> - You shouldn't let him get to you.<eos> - He doesn't.
I reach 10 and you're gone... you're not fucked.<eos> Do you understand your options, Jacob?<eos> Yeah, here's your option, asshole.<eos> All right, then. Here we go.<eos> That was like a group mugging.<eos> - People in New York are fucking nuts.<eos> Oh, fuck this.<eos> I need a real smoke.<eos> I think I hurt this guy and he's gonna come here looking for me.<eos> He already did.
What? You got her number?<eos> No, she called me.<eos> Oh, she asked for your number?<eos> No, she didn't have to.<eos> You gave it to her.<eos> It was on that subpoena.<eos> I know what's gonna be on your subpoena.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> - You know what it means.<eos> Sure as hell do.
Angela.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> You don't get to ask me that.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Oh, fuck you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> No.<eos> Liar.<eos> I don't.
I thought the gods had brought us together to try to stop my vision of the apocalypse, but now it seems we're actually making it happen.<eos> You have to get us in there so we can try and stop him.<eos> Only if I can have the ring when we do. Look at you... in your peasant's tunic.<eos> You're no son of a King.<eos> Take him the ring!<eos> He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
What do you make of it?<eos> It's the temple on Mount Pelion.<eos> Its wings are said to touch the sky.<eos> The next full moon is in four days, and he wants to meet at sunset.<eos> Tell me she isn't useful.<eos> How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
I need a new cloak and Verity must help me choose.<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ The choosing of cloaks.<eos> May that always be the worst of your worries!<eos> Now, don't delay me, I have a party to attend. Jud!<eos> Bring the horses.<eos> You spoil me.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I like to be appreciated.<eos> Who doesn't?
These are strange times, Elizabeth.<eos> We should no longer stand on ceremony.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Sooner or later, we must all declare... for one side or another.<eos> For which side do you declare?<eos> For no side.<eos> At least... for no man.<eos> You must not say this to me, George.<eos> Oh, I must.<eos> And I do.
- The victim's sister.<eos> - Oh, did the victim give you her number?<eos> No.<eos> Then how exactly did you know where to reach her?<eos> What the fuck was that all about?<eos> Is it really your business?<eos> Did you spend the night with that asshole?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Well, I care, because Captain Fucking Rayburn is the douchiest shit bag in that whole fucking family.<eos> You did.
That's not even the most interesting thing about me.<eos> I had a red-haired Chinese student once.<eos> Do you know what the odds of that are?<eos> I'd imagine pretty small.<eos> Maybe one in 100,000 people.<eos> It requires a genetic mutation.<eos> Never seen it before or since.<eos> The reason I have red hair is completely different.<eos> Hm. Do you know what the gene that causes red hair is called?<eos> I do.
Her husband didn't know anything about it, and she'd like to keep it that way.<eos> She only told me because I'm a minister.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.<eos> And I'd appreciate you not using my sacred calling in this way in the future.<eos> What, god doesn't want you solving crimes?<eos> Well, of course he does.
Hey.<eos> [Sighs] I'm really glad that you caught Jason's murderer.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> And girl.<eos> You can show your gratitude by giving me my share of that thing when you sell it.<eos> And what if I don't want to sell it?<eos> I'm you.<eos> Eventually, I get tired of everything and everybody and sell it out for a profit.<eos> You have the same disease.<eos> Everybody does.
I think I might've liked it better when it was just you, my mom, and a genetically modified cucumber.<eos> I mean, now it's... it's what?<eos> It's you, my mom, and a cucumber in love?<eos> We never really used the...<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Not important.<eos> All right, the point is we're not in love.<eos> No, of course you're not in love.<eos> You don't know what love is!<eos> Oh, and you do?
What are you doing here?<eos> Confession.<eos> Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sunday afternoons.<eos> I came here to see you.<eos> Julie thinks you're out drinking.<eos> Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
You didn't deposit any bodily fluids inside her?<eos> No.<eos> - In her mouth?<eos> - Are you getting off on that.<eos> A woman died here.<eos> And listen, I don't like this any more than you.<eos> But I need to know exactly what happened, every detail.<eos> Did she suck your cock?<eos> - Fucking hell!<eos> - Did she?
He took him to the racing, to restaurants, his wife and family.<eos> - You pulled the trigger. - Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> And you see how he treats me now.<eos> I'm making plans.<eos> You should too.<eos> Oh, fucking students, always leave the place in a state.<eos> Well, it's probably good that they get to practice though, before they start slicing up live people.<eos> - I thought they cleaned this shit up as they go.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
Some parents believe that a good education is the best gift a parent can give a child.<eos> Do you?<eos> Well, better to have it than not.<eos> And changing schools, It's a... an opportunity, you know, you can reinvent yourself.<eos> You can be anything you want to be.<eos> - Do I have to go back to St. Bart's.<eos> - No.<eos> I think you're done with St. Bart's.<eos> I told your form teacher she needed to get laid.<eos> She really does.
So, grief-stricken, he carries her up to the marital bed...<eos> Jeez.<eos> ... And tries to<eos> "love" her back to life.<eos> It was 7 days before I went looking for him.<eos> He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Who's running this circus?<eos> I am, sir.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Would you mind telling me what in the hell is going on?<eos> Detective John Shaw.<eos> - He's had a few problems.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Shaw was shot in the line of duty seven months ago, along with his rookie partner, Ray Jones, who lost his life.<eos> A lot of cops around here blamed him for his death.<eos> They still do.
No, better make it all night.<eos> Then maybe I can offer your milk to Athena as proof of your manhood.<eos> You want me to bed the priestess?<eos> A sacred tribute.<eos> Are you sure this will work?<eos> So long as we postpone the battle until the next full moon to give Athena time to convince Ares of your bravery.<eos> Very well.<eos> Tell my generals of the delay.<eos> Where did he find this man?<eos> He did it on his own.
I think Tyler took it.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> I took it. What?<eos> Red card, dude.<eos> Took it where?<eos> Oh, you should be thanking me that I got to the cash<eos> - Not your decision. We're partners.<eos> Well, you promised to shut down our little operation, partner.<eos> And I know you haven't.<eos> I did!
It's a message.<eos> What's it saying?<eos> Run.<eos> They're gone.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Please, I just have a few questions. You must leave.<eos> If he catches you...<eos> Just tell me... What is this?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
There, there. Take it.<eos> Right again. Again.<eos> I feel it.<eos> How about I ask you a question?<eos> Why did you ever caught in your house?<eos> Are you afraid of somebody?<eos> The only person I scared off right now is holding that gun at me.<eos> Minx, I'm Claire.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
Loser.<eos> [ chuckles ] Black hoodies.<eos> H-hey!<eos> Bad touching. Gravely:<eos> Portland police.<eos> Those are just vitamins.<eos> They aren't even mine. Should we check all of you for vitamins?<eos> If we tell you we know talia lennox, will you go away?<eos> That's gonna be your best chance. Talia ran away to her dad's.<eos> No, she didn't.
You're being emotional, little bird.<eos> - I didn't want this!<eos> - That's why you're here.<eos> You tried to refuse the gift. Sadly, the only way out of here now is if you reach the gift first.<eos> It's him or you.<eos> Please, Khlyen.<eos> I don't want to kill him!<eos> From where I'm standing, little bird, it doesn't look like you can.<eos> I thought you were special. I thought you wanted to make me proud.<eos> - I do.
- You remember. Don't pretend like you don't remember.<eos> Just- - I don't-- I don't know.<eos> I actually just can't... Do this.<eos> Like I get this is a big deal for you, And you have a big, complicated brain,<eos> Sometimes my feelings need to be thought of.<eos> No, I am- - I'm not going to be pressured into saying it. I'm just not going to be, okay?<eos> I need- - I need you to go home.<eos> No, I don't-- I don't want to go.<eos> I... I just--<eos> I- - I do.
That's a line from The Price of Life is Death.<eos> And you were so great in it.<eos> The world is inspired by your movies, Lito, and I want you to continue making them, OK?<eos> Dani...<eos> Hernando, I'll be fine.<eos> If life has taught me anything, it's that... I can take a punch.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't have too much fun without me.<eos> - What am I going to do? I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
Lito, you're beautiful.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - It's great, we're fine.<eos> We have it, OK?<eos> And your, uh... friend is here.<eos> Oh, yeah. My bodyguard. Yeah.<eos> - Hello, Kala.<eos> - Papa-ji.<eos> - I had no idea you came to the temple.<eos> - I don't.
- Done.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Stiles says he can't find anything on the author.<eos> He thinks it's a pen name.<eos> "In a small New England town, teenagers are taken in the night and buried alive.<eos> "Days later they emerge transformed, wreaking havoc and spreading terror, "commanded by an ancient order of parascientists known only as<eos> "the Dread Doctors."<eos> Sounds vaguely familiar.<eos> How does it end?<eos> It doesn't.
You have been chosen.<eos> Zack.<eos> Ahhh... There. You talk.<eos> It has begun.<eos> Come.<eos> This place is a maze.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's, uh, here.<eos> You don't remember which unit?<eos> Of course I do.
My daughter's been missing for four hours.<eos> Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to share that information.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> This is a federal case now, Miss Wilson.<eos> Detective Wilson.<eos> We appreciate all the information that you've given us.<eos> But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter.<eos> Which is why you're no longer on the case.<eos> You don't have the authority to do that.<eos> Actually, I do.
- We need to deal with them.<eos> - He didn't have a lifestyle.<eos> Just please know we will.<eos> The bail hearing is Friday.<eos> I assure you... we'll be ready.<eos> Well, I don't trust him anymore.<eos> What the hell is he talking about...<eos> "Matt's lifestyle"?<eos> Oh, I think you know exactly what he's talking about.<eos> No, Tom, I don't.
That doesn't play.<eos> You're done.<eos> I swear to you on my mother's life...<eos> Your mother!<eos> Shame on you.<eos> You prey on parents.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> You're going to confess, or else.<eos> Okay, I made a mistake.<eos> You sure did.
Yes, that's right.<eos> Me, baking.<eos> Don't worry, I'm your co-pilot.<eos> We'll rally together this weekend.<eos> Oh, no, no, no. This carnival goes down in 48 hours.<eos> There is no weekend.<eos> Oops.<eos> Damn right, oops.<eos> How are we supposed to get this thing done?<eos> We don't.
This is Laura Laura?<eos> - Funny, Laura was just saying...<eos> - That's me.<eos> I have heard so much about you.<eos> Well, then maybe she told you she's out the door.<eos> Vacation.<eos> Bad timing.<eos> - Yup. - I'm gonna need the glue gun back.<eos> I have a sideline bedazzling jeans at Barneys.<eos> Of course you do.
That must be Shawn.<eos> Do you usually bring him to work?<eos> Just when I work days.<eos> It's cheaper than after-school care, or a babysitter and it's usually quiet here after lunch.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> If anyone knew how many times my boys napped in a holding cell, I'd be locked up.<eos> It's hard being a working mom.<eos> Work a full day.<eos> You make lunchboxes at 3:00 am just so you can get another five minutes of sleep.<eos> Do laundry at midnight.
Or you make a mistake somehow, let someone down.<eos> Epic mom fail.<eos> I've had those.<eos> Don't even ask me about the disaster in my living room right now.<eos> So I get why you did it.<eos> Did what?<eos> Left your son home alone.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I would never...<eos> You did.
Yes, ma'am. I feel blessed.<eos> All right, then. You too.<eos> Well, I guess I better be getting back.<eos> Well, let me fix Tawney a plate.<eos> Sure. Why not?<eos> Maybe she's got her appetite back.<eos> Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> Sure, Ted.<eos> You know where my wife is?<eos> I don't, Ted.
You'll have a support system there. That's what they do... Help manage.<eos> And I'm a phone call away, always.<eos> And, speaking of money...<eos> Here is your checkbook.<eos> And... your ATM card.<eos> Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
Maybe I can inspire you.<eos> After you have to go to this gorditos place, and across the street is this fabulous boutique.<eos> I'd take some of my other girlfriends there, but they don't have the body for the place.<eos> I said it. -Stop.<eos> -I just said it. -You said it.<eos> -There it goes. You just said it.<eos> I gotta take you to taco bell sometime, they've got this fabulous new gordita.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. -Do I have the body for it?<eos> -You do.
Man, no doubt my ex will lie her ass off to win custody.<eos> And who will suffer?<eos> My kids, my reputation.<eos> Guilty whether you did it or not.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why I'm going to court... fight the good fight.<eos> Look, you should go to the press, set the record straight.<eos> The press don't want the truth. They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
Bipolar.<eos> Are you bipolar?<eos> How do you know your mother was?<eos> Shit she... Stuff she did.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like she tried to kill herself.<eos> And then would take us on a shopping spree. She would sleep depressed for months. And then would throw us a big party for one of our birthdays.<eos> Should I go on? - Have you done any of those things?<eos> Police report says you stole your lover's baby and took him...<eos> I didn't.
Yeah!<eos> Just peachy.<eos> Oh, do not ask.<eos> I am just having a bad day.<eos> Okay, well, it's about to get worse.<eos> Look, I... I...<eos> I need to go kiss Gainey's bottom, try to convince him to co-host this game with us.<eos> And I just can't do it alone.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, of course you do!
I'm all choked up.<eos> Have I answered all your questions, Detective?<eos> You haven't answered any of my questions.<eos> You took a young, naive, rich girl - with daddy issues.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - And got inside her head... - Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah. But you did.
bent you, twisted you and trimmed you, head, hands, arms, and legs.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
Well, his tastes are very specific.<eos> And that's how you'll find him.<eos> The wine, the truffles,<eos> taste in all things will be a constant between Dr. Lecter's lives.<eos> His name will change, but his taste will not.<eos> Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't. And if they don't...<eos> Well, you didn't.
Did he say something?<eos> No...<eos> But his blood did.<eos> Jackson found genetic marker anomalies that can only come from someone who was born on the Ark.<eos> It didn't come from the blood transfusion that we gave him?<eos> No.<eos> I took the sample before that.<eos> They're bleeding my friends.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
She's next.<eos> No. No.<eos> Take me.<eos> Don't touch her! - Don't touch her!<eos> Don't touch her! Don't touch her!<eos> Please.<eos> No. Oh!<eos> All right. Get a strap.<eos> Let's go. Please.<eos> Please don't.
- What are you doing?<eos> - What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Biology class?<eos> I'm filleting.<eos> - You know anything about cooking?<eos> - I suck at cooking.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one's ever taught you. That's all that means.<eos> Didn't you go to cooking school?<eos> Yeah. I did.
And you have to make eye contact, or it won't come true. Oh, okay.<eos> - Well, let's try it again. - Okay. - Cheers.<eos> Uh, oh. That was a stop sign.<eos> Y-yeah, it was.<eos> You just went right through it.<eos> Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
Fine.<eos> So, if I was a shrink, I would say, go to the source.<eos> I would say, talk to Matt.<eos> He's nonverbal.<eos> That is not true, man... the whole... that computer-y thing that he does.<eos> He's, like, a super genius, man.<eos> We talk. We have long talks.<eos> He gets me.<eos> You know very well what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't!
Hey! Hey!<eos> What the hell are you - Hey! Hey!<eos> Police! Police!<eos> - Police.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> A young lady was attacked yesterday evening.<eos> I've also got a witness says he saw some men leaving this club drunk as lords.<eos> - I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> - Then don't.
I have some news that I want to share with the family.<eos> - I'm glad you're here, Marie.<eos> I intend to bid for a field in West London.<eos> For Serge's aerodrome?<eos> Something far more important.<eos> A lasting tribute to your mother's memory.<eos> To build houses for heroes returning from war.<eos> Rose would approve entirely, son.<eos> - Does Serge know about this?<eos> - He does.
It's not the room, Castiel. It's you.<eos> This isn't going to work.<eos> I mean, come on. You look like my father.<eos> It is his body, but he's dead.<eos> And I get it, you feel bad, but you... whoever you are...<eos> are nothing to me.<eos> Claire, that's not true.<eos> I'm in large part responsible for the way your life has unfolded.<eos> I-I have a responsibility to help you.<eos> No. You don't.
Do it, do it.<eos> I guess I can do this.<eos> Do it, do it, do it, do it...<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh! Whoa!<eos> Hang in there, man!<eos> All right, Roderick, do this for the team.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Keep going. Just a little further.<eos> You did it.
Make it quick.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Um, well, I understand you don't want me at your wedding and of course that is your prerogative, but for the record, I would just like to say that I'm very hurt by that.<eos> And I fully realize that, over the years, uh, you and I have had a few minor... differences.<eos> But weddings are the time to put all those differences aside.<eos> That's a steaming load of crap.<eos> I want to be surrounded by the people who love me and the people that I love.<eos> The only person that you know how to love is yourself.<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
Yeah.<eos> How about next time we skip the part with the eel?<eos> Deal.<eos> Hey, what do you think about getting a sign on the door?<eos> - Well, you got a sign.<eos> - A real one. You should get some clients first.<eos> Just one little sign.<eos> What could it cost? Frank, you can barely afford to pay me.<eos> I thought you were working for free.<eos> I... I did... for a day.
Ah, look at me.<eos> My first international summit, and I am a nervous wreck.<eos> Have we done the right thing coming here?<eos> Wanting a better life for your people is always the right thing.<eos> You know what I'm up against, Helen.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
Our way in.<eos> You are now an official employee of Galveston Oil, Miss...<eos> Dottie Frome.<eos> What?<eos> I'm an undercover agent.<eos> This is what I do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Raul, we are both wanted by the law, okay?<eos> We need to be careful about drawing attention to ourselves.<eos> Yeah, we really do.
Lena?<eos> Come here a minute.<eos> I know it's awfully difficult at the beginning.<eos> Everyone struggles at first, but it's just a test.<eos> And you're doing very well, I must say.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Will you tell her?<eos> What was that last night?<eos> Men's gathering.<eos> What do you have to do to be taken there?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Ursel!<eos> One... more?<eos> One... more?<eos> Okay, do one more!
Eva Sinclair has ever done.<eos> Well, you ask me, it's a good thing you took over her body.<eos> Anyone who does this kind of stuff to kids has it coming.<eos> Marcel, it doesn't matter what she's done.<eos> I've still appropriated her body without her consent.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you, Rebekah.<eos> I'm just saying maybe it's a public service, but I get why it's complicated.<eos> I mean, it makes sense why you won't kiss me.<eos> It's why I wouldn't kiss you if I wanted to, which I don't.<eos> I don't, Marcel.
We're out of time.<eos> I've located hayley, and i strongly advise, Do not attempt to stand in my way.<eos> Niklaus' paintings contain Mikael's ashes in the soil.<eos> Go to the compound.<eos> You cannot stop me from getting that baby.<eos> You begin this spell.<eos> Prepare the battlefield.<eos> I'll bring hope to you.<eos> Your daughter will need my guidance...<eos> Just as freya did.
And what do you think?<eos> I think I want to get as far away from Malcolm Merlyn as I possibly can.<eos> Well, there's your answer right there.<eos> Sorry.<eos> May I borrow him for a second?<eos> Apparently, he's been more yours than mine lately, so...<eos> What happened?<eos> One of our trackers sent a signal from the Starling City docks.<eos> Except we don't have any tracking devices in the field.<eos> Unless we do.
I'm going somewhere where I can learn how to make sure that no one will ever hurt us again.<eos> Come here.<eos> How'd Merlyn take it?<eos> I think he just felt inconvenienced.<eos> We made the right choice, right, by refusing Merlyn's help?<eos> I don't know if we made the right choice, Laurel, but we definitely did the right thing.<eos> And how many people are gonna die tonight because of it?<eos> We made a decision, Roy.<eos> I know, and I know that I was outvoted, but that doesn't change the fact that we're outmanned.<eos> What if it doesn't?
And you'll see her again again.<eos> This is different.<eos> Just been thinking about the person I was the brother that I was and how he probably died when that boat went down.<eos> All this time, I've been struggling with who I am.<eos> You think who you're supposed to be is the next Ra's al Ghul?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The only thing I can know for sure is that everything that I've done everything that happened it led me right here to this moment.<eos> And, Felicity, if that's true then I don't know what it was all for.<eos> I do.
I didn't know what I was doing, ok?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I'm so sorry, Laurel.<eos> If Merlyn drugged you... then it wasn't your fault.<eos> But how could you work with him?<eos> How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.<eos> In 1854, I encountered an illusionist in Vienna, and he was dazzling, magnificent, powerful, and then nearly half a century later,<eos> He was withered, broken, dying.<eos> You see, a magician can cheat many things except one.<eos> Please. I was your horseman.<eos> Let me hunt for you once more.<eos> Allow me to prove to you my reborn loyalty.<eos> Al Sa-Her, face your death with honor.<eos> Or at least dignity.<eos> Please don't do this.
Ok.<eos> But after, we go to my lab, get the nano-tech, inject it in me, and publish the results in the "New England Journal of Medicine."<eos> Ah, I'm sorry, but that's simply not possible.<eos> Uh, I invented the tech, it's possible.<eos> Starling General has a very strict policy against experimental procedures.<eos> Wait, there is a procedure that could save his life, and you're saying you won't perform it?<eos> I'm saying I can't perform it.<eos> The hospital won't permit the use of an experimental or untested technology.<eos> How do you know your invention won't kill you?<eos> I don't.
We're just going to negotiate with him now?<eos> Are we just going to give in?<eos> Turn over an innocent person?<eos> She's not innocent!<eos> She's the daughter of the Demon.<eos> She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
The door was open.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your staring into nothingness.<eos> He should have let me die.<eos> That was never an option.<eos> That's why I love him.<eos> I didn't know... about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> It was complicated.<eos> But I did love him.<eos> Despite everything, I still do.
I'd say you have the right to remain silent, but I'm not a cop.<eos> It's over.<eos> That's it.<eos> Nice and easy.<eos> The man you think I am, he'd kill you here and now.<eos> I told you to back off, and you didn't listen!<eos> So kill me, go ahead.<eos> Show Felicity the kind of man you really are.<eos> I have nothing to prove to her.<eos> But you do.
You think you're the last guy on the planet?<eos> I just came by to apologize.<eos> I should have known it was a waste of time.<eos> A guy your age, and single, can only be a bastard.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Never mind.<eos> - Calm down. - Let me go.<eos> - Sorry, calm down.<eos> - I want to go. - I made a mistake coming here.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Scuba.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, It's an acronym.<eos> - What if firestorm isn't a word?<eos> Fusion ignition research experiment and science Of transmutation originating rna and molecular structures.<eos> It's 800 pages.<eos> There's a lot of stuff in there, But it mostly focuses on transmutation, Which is the process of altering the structure of an element<eos> By unzipping the atoms... - And rebuilding it to create an entirely new element.<eos> - Well, the article was co-written by jason rush, Who's a grad student here at hudson university. So if anybody knows what happened to ronnie...<eos> - Maybe he does.
Well... right back at you, sir.<eos> Happy birthday, Brick.<eos> Hey. It is.<eos> And the best gift... is you and Lemon.<eos> Couldn't ask for a better man for my girl to end up with.<eos> W-Well, that means a lot.<eos> But... how on earth did you two end up an item out of nowhere like this?<eos> I... Wait, seriously, you really don't know?<eos> No, on second thought, uh, I don't want to know.<eos> No, no, I don't.
You served. You do too.<eos> And every day on this job, we get to see what other people would kill and die for and I used to think it was different, but it's not.<eos> It's the same. Love, hate. With a side of stupid.<eos> You seem...<eos> Old?<eos> You okay?<eos> Go home and kiss your wife.<eos> You can count on that.<eos> Thought you punched out.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I have a pile of evidence that says otherwise. Someone else had the murder weapon.<eos> The gambling angle was never fully investigated.<eos> You read my files, didn't you?<eos> My confidential file.<eos> You want me to feel bad?<eos> You would've sent an innocent man to jail.<eos> No. (stuttering) you've been a slug for months, And this... This is the thing<eos> That gets you off of your ass? Not your family, not your fiance, Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!
My confidential file.<eos> You want me to feel bad?<eos> You would've sent an innocent man to jail.<eos> No. (stuttering) you've been a slug for months, And this... This is the thing<eos> That gets you off of your ass? Not your family, not your fiance, Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!<eos> (scoffs) I get that you had to do what you think is right, But you could at least feel bad about it.<eos> You just massively derailed my career And you don't even care, do you?<eos> Yeah, you don't.
But being chased by angry bulls, no. Pbht!<eos> The museum of antiquities in leiden.<eos> I am not spending my vacation in some dust-filled old muse-- oh!<eos> Zip-lining in coast rica.<eos> [ sighs ] [ gasps ] I have an idea.<eos> This is something that neither one of us have done And could be appealing to both of us.<eos> An archaeological dig in egypt.<eos> See? I-I-I'm fascinated with ancient culture, And you love adventures.<eos> Do I get to wear the indiana jones hat?<eos> We both do.
It was real bad.<eos> Sir? When all of a sudden you thought you were under legitimate threat.<eos> Um, not exactly. Sir, the truth is...<eos> Let the admiral finish, commander. Yes, sir.<eos> You fired your sidewinder under the normal rules of engagement. Fully justified given the information you had at the time.<eos> The missile fell harmlessly into the sea.<eos> Isn't that correct, commander?<eos> But we did hit something, sir. A drone.<eos> Commander Tilson, your sidewinder did not hit a drone. Therefore, the US Navy is not responsible for starting a military engagement between two sovereign nations.<eos> No, we did not, sir.
That's funny.<eos> That's exactly how I used to feel about you.<eos> Jackie, why are you here if you can't do the thing you want to do so badly?<eos> Listen, I clean the lab, I pee in a cup, you know.<eos> I come here every day so I don't use.<eos> I'm telling you as a friend, that plan is kind of fucked.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> All I'm saying is if I suddenly woke up one day and found out I wasn't wanted here, man, I would walk out that front door and never look back.<eos> Our first patient together, bike messenger, I told you to do the scan, you didn't, the kid died.<eos> Today, you did the scan.
There's faneuil hall.<eos> - It's a working spacecraft, which I ...<eos> - I didn't come here for the comics, Chip.<eos> Oh. Is this about the parking?<eos> I talked with the angry-bear guy, Korsak.<eos> You've been leaking information to the press about active murder investigations, which could compromise those investigations.<eos> I haven't leaked anything.<eos> You sent e-mails from your work computer.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes, I did.
Still waiting to hear back...<eos> - including B.C.U.<eos> - I didn't know you were applying there!<eos> You know, I know people on the committee.<eos> - I can make a call for you.<eos> - That's a really nice offer, but I wanna go where I'm wanted.<eos> And if you call them, then it's not about me.<eos> I should go wash my hands before I dig in to these potato skins.<eos> Jane, we have to convince her to let me make the call.<eos> - No, we don't.
Another awesome guy will find his way to you.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the next awesome person<eos> - doesn't have to show up for a while.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You might need more chairs for the meeting tonight.<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> You do?<eos> I got us two box seats to the New York Philharmonic movie night.<eos> Oh. They play the themes to all your favorite movies.<eos> Um, "Star Wars," "Jaws," "Indiana Jones."<eos> I mean, I think this might be the most thoughtful thing I've ever done.<eos> There's... trains.<eos> You don't want to go to movie night?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, no. Ugh!<eos> You think that's nasty, you should try the kiwi.<eos> Jackie, I seriously hope you were not administering care to a patient at this hospital.<eos> Gloria, they were short a nurse.<eos> I made it very clear you were not to touch any patient.<eos> If I did not touch that patient, she would be dead.<eos> - Is that what you want?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor. I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
You're right, I can't fake it.<eos> I know a fraud when I see one.<eos> And buddy, you're it.<eos> So, if you try to go after my friends, just know you'll have to go through me first.<eos> Too bad you're stuck in here.<eos> Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
The business will never recover.<eos> - We didn't fucking do anything.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> There's no way to keep it out of the news.<eos> Mom is gonna be devastated.<eos> It's gonna ruin our name. It's gonna ruin our reputation.<eos> Everything Mom and Dad ever worked for their whole lives is gonna be gone.<eos> - John, we cannot report this.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Don't want you keeling over after you take this.<eos> Peyote?<eos> Raul says you're stuck in your head and this is one of the best ways to get out.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> You're, uh, not going alone.<eos> I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
No kidding.<eos> All right, what do we know about ABADDON?<eos> Aren't they some kind of anarchist hacker group?<eos> All about bringing down the system?<eos> I don't know, but if what they're plotting is the sin that breaks the next Horseman's seal...<eos> Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
Leland Schiller is the leader of ABADDON.<eos> AKA the Horseman of Pestilence.<eos> What kind of sin is he about to commit? Erin! This is pretty serious, Ms. Calder.<eos> Your blood pressure's very low, which is why you fainted.<eos> I want to run some more tests, but I will say that a hematoma that size should not just appear overnight.<eos> I probably just bumped into something without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until we figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab if you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
So let's pair up, people.<eos> Hi.<eos> Looks like you could use a buddy.<eos> You can't be doing this.<eos> It's not just your life anymore.<eos> It's the baby's, too.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> It's not even yours.<eos> Trust me, your father made me get a DNA test, just to make sure.<eos> Of course he did.
You can have both.<eos> That is unnecessary, but thank you, Meatball.<eos> - That was really something!<eos> - I agree.<eos> It was really something.<eos> Cousin Pammy!<eos> Oh, my God, that's...<eos> Pamela... Bailey...<eos> Hi! Remember me from the Bluebell Bed Breakfast?<eos> Uh-huh. Sure I do!
I mean, you were right, I, you know? I, can't just up and leave;<eos> I got obligations.<eos> You know, I got real feelings for AnnaBeth.<eos> And I could actually see a future there, so...<eos> You know, sometimes we just... we do things for the people that we care about.<eos> Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
There was a fire in the men's room.<eos> In the men's room?<eos> Small trash can fire.<eos> Somebody sneaking a cigarette.<eos> System extinguished it in 15 seconds.<eos> I'm so sorry, dr. Isles.<eos> I mean, what kinda idiot smokes a cigarette in the bathroom?<eos> That's a really good question, larry.<eos> I can't believe some dumb-ass Threw a lit cigarette in the trash can.<eos> They didn't.
What the hell?<eos> !<eos> I-I-I am so sorry.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with your whole department? I know.<eos> I, um...<eos> Please, at least let me pay to get those cleaned.<eos> It -- it's the least I can do.<eos> You think that's gonna make right what you've done?<eos> It doesn't.
That's curious, don't you think?<eos> I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> And I wonder why you're lying to me, Ted.<eos> I'm not lying to you, Janet.<eos> Okay, maybe not, but you're sure not telling me something.<eos> I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
I'll bet you anything that these keys open up a safe or a chest or... something in a cave marked on this map.<eos> Why's the treasure in a grave?<eos> There was no treasure in the grave.<eos> This is what pirates do.<eos> They leave a map or a code that needs to be ciphered.<eos> This is typical, classic pirate bullshit. Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
- Who took the card?<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - There's the cloud, you know?<eos> - What do you mean, the cloud?<eos> - The backup to the cloud.<eos> If you have a drive, I'll dub you a copy.<eos> Fuck O'Shea.<eos> Did you see what he did back there?<eos> I don't have a drive.<eos> I do.
Don't be.<eos> I thought Janet was her.<eos> Our Janet.<eos> But she wasn't.<eos> It's over.<eos> No. You have to save that poor girl.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I've seen what it does.<eos> You don't believe it.<eos> I do.
- I understand why you did what you did.<eos> - I'm glad to hear it.<eos> But you must understand, Emily, my suffragist sisters are all I have. I do understand.<eos> It just... sometimes the way you behave...<eos> You frighten me. - I frighten you?<eos> - You will do anything<eos> - for the cause.<eos> - Not just for the cause.<eos> - I... I doubt I have your passion.<eos> - You do.
I mean, without his boat, their crops may as well rot in the ground.<eos> He's got his own land too.<eos> A convicted lag - 100 acres. Can you believe it?<eos> Blackwood's Lagoon, he calls it.<eos> And he ain't the only one.<eos> Here, Dickie.<eos> Taste that egg you've been waiting to drop.<eos> Spent days staring at it, he has!<eos> Blackwood wants me to go again.<eos> Well, I don't!
I can't do this.<eos> I--honestly, I can't remember what it's like to feel anything but shame.<eos> Then let me help you. That's it, that's just it.<eos> I can't be helped.<eos> But I want to help you.<eos> Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> But eventually it will be.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Going into the future.<eos> Velcoro. What's up, man?<eos> I wanted to call.<eos> I ain't told anybody about this other thing.<eos> But somebody sent me these pictures.<eos> Pictures of me.<eos> What? Of our thing?<eos> No, it's something else. This is mine.<eos> I think I might be walking into something.<eos> Then don't.
They'll never know.<eos> It's not me. I didn't put you here.<eos> But you could get me out.<eos> Please, Frank.<eos> I got a family.<eos> It isn't me.<eos> Hi there, handsome.<eos> You made it.<eos> You're okay?<eos> I did.
Um, mostly other parents.<eos> People we've met over the years through Jayda.<eos> Everyone's been so kind.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who sent these ones?<eos> Um... Jayda, do you know who sent these?<eos> Madison's mom.<eos> Stephanie?<eos> Well, it's just that, well, Erica didn't really like her.<eos> Yes, she did.
All right, let's go.<eos> Where? Blackway's up in the town forest.<eos> As much chance as finding Bigfoot up there.<eos> Trudy said he's got a camp near the old gold mine.<eos> The old noisy creek logging site?<eos> Yep, that's what she said.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Ok.<eos> You don't have to go with us. You know that?<eos> Sure, I do.
The city's really changing.<eos> Not fast enough.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Be a shame to see all the character scrubbed away.<eos> You didn't grow up here, did you?<eos> What gave it away?<eos> When I was a kid, I used to dream what it would be like to... to live somewhere far away from Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Somewhere beautiful.<eos> What made you stay?<eos> I didn't.
Don't visit me at the office anymore, and don't tell anyone else about this.<eos> If that doesn't work for you, get up and get the hell out of my life.<eos> - That works for me.<eos> - Good.<eos> First thing, sign the agreement from the Union Allied lawyer.<eos> What?<eos> No! No, I sign that, I can't ever talk publicly about this.<eos> Yeah... but I'm not signing it.<eos> Sergei.<eos> Who did this?
All right, hang on.<eos> Uh, half a box of nails... broken glass... uh, wood, duct tape, old roadside emergency kit, - lot of plastic sheeting...<eos> - The kit, are there any flares in it?<eos> Yeah, two.<eos> All right... you're gonna cauterize the wound.<eos> Shouldn't I dig the bullet out first?<eos> Remember what I said about this not being a movie?<eos> You cut him open and start digging around, you'll kill him.<eos> This way at least he has a chance of not bleeding out before you get what you need out of him and... it'll hurt like a son of a bitch, so bonus.<eos> All right, how do I do this?
Not that I don't admire what you're trying to do... to change the world... with nothing but desire and your own two hands... secure in the knowledge that you're doing the right thing, the only thing.<eos> That's something that I do understand.<eos> But we both can't have what we want.<eos> So... your part... in this drama, by necessity, comes to an end.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than a voice on a radio to stop me.<eos> It's not me you need to worry about. It's the city you just blew the hell out of.<eos> You... You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
Or brace yourself for a full-court press.<eos> 'Cause they'll not only follow you, they'll follow your kids, your wife, your kids' friends.<eos> They'll reveal all your secrets.<eos> Well, you already did that when you leaked the news that I was Tom's father.<eos> That was a crime-lab error.<eos> We're looking into it.<eos> And I believe you.<eos> You should.<eos> I don't think you have any idea the nightmare that's coming your way.<eos> Yes, I do.
She doesn't keep ruining your things.<eos> Why is she dressed like that?<eos> She's coming to marisol's book party with us.<eos> Have blanca watch her. Yeah.<eos> I don't mind. Really.<eos> We can't leave katy with someone new.<eos> You know that.<eos> Hey, katy?<eos> Hey, sweetie, how about I make us a little snack?<eos> Yeah, do that.
I understand.<eos> But I'm back now.<eos> You are.<eos> Uh, I don't mean to make you sad.<eos> Was it wrong of me to come looking for you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm glad you're alive.<eos> Zoila, I bought you something to cheer you up.<eos> - I don't need cheering up.<eos> - Of course you do.
I don't know, but Mrs. Fleming asked me to move it.<eos> - To move what?<eos> - The hand.<eos> She wants me to dump it on the Powells' lawn.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, Mrs. Fleming doesn't want people gossiping about her, so, since the Powells already had a leg --<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> Okay. Obviously, you are not dumping the hand on the Powells.<eos> No, I agree.<eos> What do I do with it?
What can i do for you, detective?<eos> I need to ask about your relationship with louie becker.<eos> I had no relationship with him<eos> Beyond polite conversation at the club.<eos> And his disembodied tibia in my flower bed.<eos> Apparently mr. Becker had a reputation as a ladies' man.<eos> Mm. It's been suggested you might have flirted with him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It sounds like you think i had motive to murder louie.<eos> Did you?
Ernesto, por favor.<eos> I need you to release me.<eos> I understand.<eos> You feel guilty and it's breaking your heart.<eos> Yes. Exactly.<eos> And that's why I'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, I do.
I need to see you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Sure.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Carmen? [Cellphone beeps]<eos> You have a boyfriend?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
I have to go back sometime.<eos> Maybe you should quit.<eos> You never worked when we lived in México.<eos> Maybe you just move in here with me, be my wife.<eos> What about money?<eos> I'll worry about that.<eos> You just worry about Miguel, huh?<eos> Doesn't that sound nice?<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Oh, wow. I promise I'll show you a good time.<eos> [Giggles] Oh! Hands off, bitch! [Glass shatters]<eos> [Clears throat] So much for the high road.<eos> ♪ I'm so glad we're doing this.<eos> You know, maybe we can make this a regular thing.<eos> [Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
More evil schemes?<eos> I never learn, do I?<eos> Darling, I just spoke with Joy.<eos> Did you really drive her to tears?<eos> It was just a misunderstanding.<eos> But the truth is, I miss Zoila.<eos> No, no, no, no. You just think you do.<eos> You actually have a form of Stockholm Syndrome, where hostages empathize with their captors.<eos> Zoila never took me hostage.<eos> Well, in a way, she did.
You're right.<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> Oh, yes, you will, because if you lose Deion... you lose me.<eos> Well, honey, he can sleep in the guest room.<eos> Well, think fast, 'cause I have to get my son out of here.<eos> I know it seems crazy, but the Powells really do love Deion.<eos> Letting him stay here might be the best thing for him.<eos> Listen, lady.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Actually, I do.
It's a nightmare.<eos> So where are we on selling the house?<eos> Evelyn's impatient.<eos> [Sighs] I'm doing everything I can.<eos> What if I knocked a million or two off the asking price?<eos> The problem is not the price.<eos> It's the disclosures.<eos> Your home has been the site of a murder, a suicide, and a chopped off leg.<eos> Well, we don't have to tell people about that.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?<eos> You have to understand, I have needs.<eos> [Exhales deeply] Cleaning needs.<eos> So I'm not enough for you anymore, is that it?<eos> Joy gets the job done, that's all.<eos> And the truth is, you need help while you're pregnant.<eos> You can't clean this big house alone.<eos> You should've talked to me about it instead of sneaking around behind my back.<eos> I tried, but you always get so defensive.<eos> I do not!
Okay, I'll ask around, make some calls.<eos> Okay, while you're at it, can you ask about a Lois Miller, too? Sure.<eos> Who's Lois Miller?<eos> She reported Caroline beecher missing.<eos> I don't know if she's a friend or another "pros" or what.<eos> After seven years, you're not expecting a happy ending, are you?<eos> Why would I start now?<eos> I like your little hat.<eos> Guess you talked to Lucille. Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I think I need to go to bed alone.<eos> Angela doesn't have anything on us.<eos> No files, wiretaps, phone records.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - You sure? I just came from her apartment.<eos> I did find some good news, though.<eos> What the fuck does that mean?<eos> Well, what it means is I found a file on Nomar and I found his phone.<eos> He was a CI working for her, yes.<eos> Nothing to do with us.
He knew about the starfish.<eos> That, I can't figure.<eos> You asked Waits for proof.<eos> He gave it to you.<eos> Smoking gun, man.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> I don't know his angle, but I'm not buying it.<eos> He didn't kill that Delacroix child.<eos> Okay.<eos> But what if he did?
She'll kill me!<eos> She'll be okay, but she really should see a doctor.<eos> Her boyfriend's an ophthalmologist, but he's on vacation with his wife.<eos> I'm sorry. Does one of you live here?<eos> Mrs. Voorhees didn't tell me that she had a daughter.<eos> Jacqueline?<eos> I'm her stepdaughter.<eos> And you're what, the new Hunong?<eos> I'm Kimmy, and I'm going to have to tell your stepmother that you were drinking.<eos> No, you don't.
Then get them back on the grid!<eos> - Wha... - What happened to you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No!<eos> God damn it.<eos> - You have disappointed us, Adam.<eos> - Chancellor, I can explain.<eos> We'll be back in a minute. I just have to reset.<eos> You know how vital the neural connections are to us.<eos> I do.
Sol, for the last time, there is no keeper pile.<eos> That's actually what's on our family crest.<eos> Hang on a minute!<eos> This is your yearbook!<eos> I still read things people wrote in my high school yearbook.<eos> "People say we won't stay friends later in life.<eos> In this case, it's true...<eos> See ya never."<eos> Who wouldn't want to save that?<eos> What do I do with this stack of birthday cards?
Hi! - You're back.<eos> - I am.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> You didn't, like...<eos> Get some weird message from me or anything?<eos> Did you leave a weird message?<eos> Not on purpose.<eos> Sss... Uh, Scott called me while I was calling you, and then I just thought that, I don't know, m-maybe the whole thing ended up on your voice-mail, but...<eos> It did not.
Snack time.<eos> [Chuckles] I ordered from Mozza.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Sweetie, you have to eat something.<eos> I am eating... olives.<eos> It's not good to keep it all pent up inside.<eos> Fine. I will leave you alone, if that's what you'd like.<eos> But, um, just know that I'm here for you, okay?<eos> [Sighs] Why does everything have to be so hard?<eos> It doesn't.
I'm Vivian.<eos> You must be Joss.<eos> Oh, my god! You're Vivian! It's...<eos> It's so nice to meet you.<eos> Mm. I wish that I could stay, but I...<eos> - You've got things. I know. - Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
Something tells me she's getting involved.<eos> I don't blame her for not listening to me.<eos> I'm dating a married couple.<eos> [Sniffs] Oh, my God! This candle smells delicious.<eos> Do you sell these here?<eos> What?<eos> You're not... you're not supposed to be in tonight.<eos> Uh, this is true.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> I mean, you look... you look good. You look amazing. Come here.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just this candle has a frickin' tricky wick or something.<eos> Well, you know, I feel like we don't really need it.<eos> I mean, there's 37 other candles in the room.<eos> We're probably fine without that one. Oh, crap.<eos> - Are we out of champagne?<eos> - We don't need champagne.<eos> Wh... of course we do.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I'm not an idiot, Karen.<eos> I know there's none of me in there.<eos> I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
Why don't I throw your bags in the car?<eos> I'll help.<eos> I feel I should...<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> No problem.<eos> Don't be mad at Marc.<eos> He didn't hide his drinking from you to be sneaky.<eos> He just didn't want you to think any less of him.<eos> I'm not sure he cares what I think.<eos> Well, of course he does.
Police have accused Ms. Raines of conspiring with friend and business associate Josslyn Carver, who was previously solely charged in connection with the...<eos> Harry. Have you seen the news?<eos> Just now.<eos> How is this happening?<eos> I thought that video of Calista was supposed to get Joss out.<eos> Didn't David promise... yeah, I'm calling the bastard right now.<eos> - Call me after you talk to him. - Okay.<eos> Will do.<eos> You said that we didn't have to dress up for this.<eos> We don't.
Are you lookin' to die?<eos> You look like you wanna die.<eos> You like killing unarmed men, don't you?<eos> I just like killin' men.<eos> Especially when their conversation bores me so.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You look awful familiar to me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I do know you.<eos> Yes, I do.
Dear God.<eos> Simon, wait there.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Simon, go next door to Murphy's Tavern.<eos> There will be constables there.<eos> What do I tell them?<eos> Tell them Handsome Randolph Henderson is dead.<eos> And then he fell backwards, driving Handsome Randolph's head directly into the mat.<eos> It's a wonder he survived.<eos> He didn't, George.
It's a match, sir.<eos> Well then, I believe we have more questions for Mr. McAllister.<eos> Quite.<eos> I'll bring him in.<eos> This is beyond tiresome.<eos> This is the syringe used to administer the fatal dose of morphine that killed Mr. Henderson.<eos> And this syringe has your fingermarks all over it.<eos> You'll recall that I didn't fall for your little pen trick.<eos> You don't have my fingermarks from which to cross reference.<eos> But we do.
Oh God, Josiah, come on.<eos> You've got to do it.<eos> - Fartlek.<eos> - Please do it.<eos> - Country of origin?<eos> - He's just got to.<eos> - I know he's gonna do it.<eos> - Sweden.<eos> - Oh there!<eos> He did it! He did it!
I am cool with it.<eos> It's just weird having your best friend.<eos> Hook up with your brother.<eos> Ross flipped his lid when he found out Chandler was dating Monica.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Monica and Chandler start dating?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You are the worst time traveler ever.<eos> You tell me everything I don't want to know.<eos> And nothing I do.
I bought a $69 ticket to Atlantic City.<eos> Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now. Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah, I see that.<eos> - Book.<eos> - She wants you to read it.<eos> "Herr Brum has just started to do what he does every Tuesday."<eos> "When you grow up, you're going to be a train driver, Guld-Ivar exclaims."<eos> - Book isn't that fun.<eos> - No, I don't like it either.<eos> You have to speak with a story voice, and sound like a talking bear.<eos> - There aren't any talking bears.<eos> - This one does.
You know that.<eos> Hell, I can't even talk to my own son anymore.<eos> I need help.<eos> So if you could just...<eos> Give her some perspective...<eos> Nobody gives that woman perspective.<eos> - Barb has a heart.<eos> She does. - After all this, you think that... that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Not afraid.<eos> He needs to support us.<eos> He wouldn't have called this a hate crime if we hadn't gone public, so we have to...<eos> We have to organize like they are.<eos> We should...<eos> Organize how?<eos> We should have our own demonstration...<eos> Same place at the same time.<eos> No, they have had weeks to get ready.<eos> To do what?
I was thinking that maybe I could help fix up Matt and Gwen's place in exchange for staying there.<eos> You want to sleep in the house where Matt was killed?<eos> - Are you sure you want to... stay here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
Tried to negotiate, got hectic.<eos> Carter was short on funds, so Skokie told him he'd give him drugs if I blew him.<eos> Carter was like... that.<eos> Stole some cash, credit cards, took off.<eos> But you weren't there?<eos> No.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Carter comes back, tells me how Matt Skokie was all " this" and " that," "... your white bitch."<eos> Carter didn't do anything.
To kill a 100 fascists with this gun!<eos> Dismiss them, Commander. Dismissed!<eos> Makarov.<eos> Keep an eye out for her, if she follows the path of her father...<eos> You understand, right?<eos> You should always have a new tactic against him.<eos> Never the same rifle. Each rifle has a character.<eos> You need to understand and handle the rifle as you would your wife.<eos> Do you have a wife, Captain?<eos> No, I do not.
(man) No. You listen to me, Doctor.<eos> That ain't gonna stop these men.<eos> They got a job to do, and they mean to do it.<eos> They're gonna be up in that hospital tonight.<eos> W-what--what do you-- what do you want from me?<eos> What you think I want?<eos> I want you to save him.<eos> Antoine dies tonight, we gonna have a problem.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You do that, Doctor.

You are a little bit crazy, but I like that.<eos> Honestly ?<eos> A few years back I had almost something.<eos> Not a contagious disease, an accident.<eos> An accident ?<eos> What had happened ?<eos> I do not talk about it, but since then I relativize more.<eos> ls being with me better than lying in a coma?<eos> I still hesitate.<eos> Over the last years did you do it with or without a condom ?
I'm nothing like him.<eos> What happened to your friends with the beards?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> You sure do have a knack for survival.<eos> You left me there to die, Sheriff.<eos> I'm not the sheriff.<eos> What do you want, an apology?<eos> No. I would have done the same thing.<eos> You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.<eos> No, it didn't.
Yeah, yeah, we talked.<eos> They explain everything?<eos> You mean about Theresa?<eos> Yeah, that too.<eos> Nick told you that he sees things, right?<eos> Uh-huh. And you do understand that everything Nick told you is all real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... uh...<eos> So you know all about...<eos> I do.
He's different.<eos> About the same age as this kid, except he had a few live RPGs in his gut.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You want to know what he said to me?<eos> He said he was sorry for getting me in this mess.<eos> He was afraid of getting me killed.<eos> You must have been scared to death.<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom."<eos> You're lucky it didn't go off.<eos> No, no, it did.
I was a 5-star recruit, all-American,<eos> - 20-some-odd scholarships,<eos> - Man...<eos> I really don't want to hear about your stupid glory days right now.<eos> Now, that... that's true.<eos> That's true, my glory days.<eos> My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp.<eos> Never played a game.<eos> I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from.<eos> - I do.
He was enforcing the law.<eos> He was enforcing your revenge.<eos> Apparently, in Texas, there's something called The Romeo and Juliet Law, which allows for consensual intercourse with a minor within three years of age.<eos> It's... it's not illegal.<eos> We heard the deputy was your buddy, and that's why you did it.<eos> He did it because we served together.<eos> We'd do anything for each other.<eos> Look, I get that.<eos> With all due respect, boys...<eos> Hey, I did three tours in the sandbox.
And he's still...<eos> - Totally into her.<eos> Just freaked out about her and the baby.<eos> Yeah, well, it doesn't look like this baby's gonna wait for a wedding.<eos> What are you... what are you doing in here?<eos> Getting some privacy.<eos> Well, your lab results came back.<eos> They show very high levels of marijuana.<eos> Could have told you that.<eos> S-so why didn't you?
I don't either.<eos> So, you intubated Will.<eos> I did.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> He didn't want to suffer, okay?<eos> - He signed the DNR.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> - Three months ago.<eos> Who knows what he would have wanted today?<eos> Actually, I do.
Your loss.<eos> Yoga?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I'm in.<eos> * And then I can tell myself * Hey, Jordan.<eos> Call him.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> I thought that Kim said she found a home for him.<eos> - Hi, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Consider ruptured viscus or hemoperitoneum.<eos> He's right.<eos> Paul, let's prep this patient for surgery.<eos> Thank you for your input, Dr. Cummings.<eos> I-I-I would like to observe.<eos> How 'bout I sit in on this one?<eos> You know what, it's Paul's first night in surgery, so I don't think it's... scrubs are right in there.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> You didn't have to say yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You get the side.<eos> Okay, on three.<eos> Both: 1, 2, 3.<eos> Okay, easy, easy.<eos> C-spine intact on palpation.<eos> Damn, this is bad.<eos> We need to stop the bleeding now.<eos> Man.<eos> We need to get him out of here.<eos> Yeah, we do.
We should be there in 20 minutes.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's get him out of here.<eos> Done.<eos> That's great.<eos> Carl, you did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...<eos> Yeah, we do.
If you pay for every drug that's not covered by insurance, you'll be broke in a week.<eos> Okay, then I'll... I'll worry about that next week.<eos> Paul, come on.<eos> Look, you have a big heart, and I like that about you.<eos> But we need to be realistic about what we can and cannot do, all right?<eos> All right, I will try and fast-track the paperwork on the medication, but it could still take a month.<eos> All right, so for now, add on an I.V. aminoglycoside.<eos> All right, that might work.<eos> Okay, but, uh, this sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.
- No, it's okay.<eos> Ethan, no one's gonna be mad at you, all right?<eos> It's okay.<eos> But my mom will get upset, and she doesn't handle that well.<eos> Just curious... what does your mom do when she gets upset?<eos> She just... I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I-I'm tired and I don't feel well.<eos> This doesn't sound good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
She's really smart.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> He told me he's been holding his pee to protect you.<eos> He told me that when he wets the bed, your husband knocks the crap out of you?<eos> I'm sorry, mom.<eos> I had to tell somebody.<eos> So, the dental work that showed up on your scan, the vertigo... that isn't from a car accident, is it?<eos> You need to get out.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> - You don't.
He's just trying to cover his ass.<eos> Even if that's the case, it's still not your job.<eos> Your job is to be a doctor and finish working up Sid.<eos> Clear?<eos> Crystal.<eos> Hey.<eos> This the windshield guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> His wife had no idea.<eos> Still doesn't.
It's not a question of lying.<eos> It's protecting.<eos> They told me my mom died when I was little.<eos> Then later I found out she died having me.<eos> When my dad was sick, he said he'd be fine, and six months later, he was dead.<eos> Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying.<eos> That's not lying?<eos> Devin, I am so sorry.<eos> And I know that this must be...<eos> No, you don't.
I'm tired of old dogs disappointing me today.<eos> Just be one of the good ones, please!<eos> I'm trying to be, now listen to me.<eos> For your own good, get outta here.<eos> I don't want you caught up in this. In what?<eos> This can't be how you end your career.<eos> Legendary killjoy caught and caged like some kind of animal?<eos> How do you think it ends, Dutch?<eos> You think they throw us a parade when they take back our badges?<eos> They don't.
It'll look a little conspicuous where we're going next.<eos> Mm. I was analyzing the particulates that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind, and I found something very interesting.<eos> When Clay's cells come into contact with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?

Textile factory.<eos> Guards.<eos> Five.<eos> Six-six.<eos> You play games, huh?<eos> W-Why, why?<eos> I tell you.<eos> No!<eos> You got provisions ready to move?<eos> Yes, we do, sir.
Now asthma's gone.<eos> My-my uncle...<eos> worst drunk you ever saw.<eos> Clean and sober, like poof.<eos> And beyond all that, everyone's acting weird.<eos> Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
It bit me!<eos> Keep going.<eos> Julia?<eos> Junior?<eos> Did you speak with him?<eos> How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
What are you thinking?<eos> That I really want a drink.<eos> Well, it's good there's not a bar around.<eos> Oh, you think there's no options in here?<eos> You'd be amazed by the options.<eos> You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
- Played all of us.<eos> - Why are you letting them do this?<eos> No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.<eos> - I didn't manipulate anyone!<eos> - But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?<eos> How should I freaking know?<eos> You do, though.
He saw Rebecca the night Lila was killed wet, and... and she dosed him with PCP because she knew he was a potential witness.<eos> PCP doesn't put you in a mental institution.<eos> Rebecca's right.<eos> And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion?<eos> Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh?<eos> And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.<eos> And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.<eos> I mean, where's the facts?<eos> An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank?<eos> She didn't.
So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
But nowhere in this confession tape do the detectives say Lila was strangled.<eos> Because Lila still had her phone, which means Rebecca was lying during her psych eval.<eos> When she found out that Lila was "breaking up with her," - Rebecca snapped.<eos> - Thus explaining...<eos> - She took Lila's phone...<eos> - Teen offenders with multiple arrests...<eos> - Why Rebecca's DNA...<eos> - The photos of Sam to pin the murder...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Michaela: Of course you do.
Or maybe she's been honest this whole time.<eos> She keeps lying, yes, but isn't that what we would all do if we looked guilty of a crime we didn't commit?<eos> Meanwhile, we know Sam was on the roof that night.<eos> So, what? You team Rebecca now?<eos> I'm team whatever really freaking happened.<eos> Hey, let me in!<eos> Since when do we ever lock this door?<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Frankie D!<eos> What it do?
So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Are you a man or not? !<eos> Sure he shouldn't take the trophy?<eos> Look at me. Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> - I still do.<eos> - [Scoffs] I told you everything about me.<eos> Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what? You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
Motherfucker was in my house while I was gone!<eos> I didn't touch your girl!<eos> She ain't even my type!<eos> - What the fuck does that mean? - Tommy!<eos> I don't fucking need you alienating our right fucking hand over some bitch.<eos> Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust.<eos> - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
She's my manager.<eos> Dad, I tried to talk her out of it, but you know how...<eos> Let me tell you something, TaKeem.<eos> I have worked very hard on my relationships in order to get this done for you.<eos> And I am not gonna be having Cookie messing this up.<eos> She's not.<eos> She's stoked about it. Okay.<eos> Well, what exactly did Cookie promise you when you signed with her?<eos> To do the same thing she's doing for Jamal-- protect the music and make me a star.<eos> The same thing she did for you back in the day, right?
That's right.<eos> No, stop! Stop!<eos> You were just trying to save her, trying to please your wife.<eos> No, I was trying to put my family back together!<eos> I... I reassembled her... Piece by piece...<eos> But she was never the same.<eos> Before Whitehall, an elder would sacrifice themselves<eos> Every few decades so she could live on, carry on tradition. She would weep, scream, beg them not to.<eos> She had a good heart, Phil.<eos> She did.
You know, we already have adoption days every Saturday.<eos> Free spaying and neutering, too.<eos> Just ask for Dr. Winslow. I'm sorry.<eos> And you are...<eos> Daisy.<eos> That's a lovely name.<eos> Remember, a house is not a home without a pet!<eos> Thank you for doing that for him.<eos> I know aspects of the Tahiti program don't sit well with you.<eos> This does.
Does it show?<eos> - Uh, the fact that I've never seen you before shows.<eos> Nice of you to make an appearance at a staff meeting.<eos> - I do love a good shmear.<eos> - Everyone, welcome Iris West, our new cub.<eos> Anyone want to volunteer to be her mama bear?<eos> Mason, you picked a bad day to actually show up.<eos> - I don't nanny.<eos> - I lost the ability to make a joke back in '05.<eos> Today, you do.
But this isn't over.<eos> - Hartley, what do you want?<eos> What do you want, Hartley?<eos> I already gave my mea culpa today.<eos> - The city already hated you.<eos> You don't think I noticed that press conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?<eos> No, no, no. I've played with you too many times to let you get away with that.<eos> This is between you, me, and The Flash.<eos> - You don't want to play for those kind of stakes with me, Hartley.<eos> - Actually, I really do.
You cannot wear any shirts that expose your belly button, especially if you have an outtie. That's just gross.<eos> Dirty jokes in the workplace... Not allowed.<eos> For example...<eos> "A German broad with big honkers walks into a bar." Okay!<eos> That's uncomfortable.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Help yourselves to fig Newtons and milk and laugh about what just happened. Okay.<eos> And my brother said there's a foldout of Kathy Ireland in a white bikini looking "cold,"<eos> if you know what I mean.<eos> I don't. Me, neither.
The official drink of slimer!<eos> I was losing my audience. I had to do something quick.<eos> I have a dirty movie.<eos> Eddie's then?<eos> The guys were coming over for a dirty movie... A dirty movie I didn't have.<eos> To make some friends, i had to break some rules, and your boy was willing to do whatever it took.<eos> Why are you wearing grandma's coat?<eos> Because I'm gonna steal a dirty movie.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
He's your boyfriend, right? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you remember him?<eos> I'm sure he means well. But you need to be with people who accept you for who you are.<eos> And they are out there.<eos> You should never apologize for being you.<eos> You, Ian.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option. But I know what you really want.<eos> You do?
To Pluto.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Gaetano, I'm Alessio Righetti.<eos> - I do not bother you?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I have an interesting project, I want to make a powerful and irreverent thing.<eos> A sitcom about the economic crisis.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> I can write a script.<eos> Good, meanwhile do so.
Okay, okay.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Okay.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Nice touch with the whiskey.<eos> I know how much you hate parting with good booze.<eos> Oh, come on now, what am I, a rookie?<eos> I got the good stuff in the wheel well.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course I do.
Sometimes you might wanna do more than that. Get close to someone. Like ma and pa, you understand?<eos> Is the soldier going away, then?<eos> Why'd you say that?<eos> Pa went away.<eos> James isn't going anywhere.<eos> Can't catch me! - Loll? Loll, where are you going?<eos> - So what shall we do now then, Jo?<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> Go on, you tell.<eos> No, you do it.
I'm sorry.<eos> When... when did you find out?<eos> Nine years ago.<eos> "Nine years ago."<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm strong.<eos> Strong motherfucker. That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
No security cameras, no fingerprints.<eos> Guy was in and out like a ghost. Yeah.<eos> The murder victim, Edward Hu, he was the key witness in a murder investigation of one Kelvin Bittaker, who beat a guy to death over a spilled drink.<eos> The family has been of interest to the Dallas F.B.I. for some time.<eos> Their import/export car warehouse is a front.<eos> This murder case -- this is just a thin edge of the wedge.<eos> Now the hope here is to use Kelvin's conviction to take the whole family down.<eos> Kelvin might be looking at the needle, which might make him more pliable.<eos> Now how said the hope is, not was, from which I surmise that you have another witness to the murder?<eos> We do.
Butler, mate.<eos> I'm the butler.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> - I made it.<eos> - You made it?<eos> - Yeah. - So what is it?<eos> Well, it's a hood.<eos> Thought it would, uh, you know, spice things up.<eos> When did we start wearing hoods?<eos> - We didn't. - W...
I was prepping the case for the D.A. when word came down this morning.<eos> Press got it last night, of course.<eos> We had the murder weapon. With Flass's prints.<eos> There's no way.<eos> Apparently, the defense dug up a witness, cleared Flass of all charges.<eos> - What witness?<eos> - No idea.<eos> Only the judge and the lead attorneys were privy, and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.<eos> What about a subpoena? We don't have sufficient grounds.<eos> But I did a little snooping around.
Loeb and Falcone!<eos> You two are dead men!<eos> You're going against Loeb and Falcone? You're dead! Go!<eos> Before I lose my good cheer.<eos> He has a point.<eos> So what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is.<eos> We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I had a really good time with you last night. And...<eos> I hope that I get to see you again.<eos> At least, uh..., have some breakfast.<eos> Oh, I still have to go home and change and I am so late.<eos> Next time.<eos> Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Which is pretty interesting, I think.<eos> No, what it means is that Neville Montgomery has got some very powerful friends.<eos> Have you got something on him?<eos> The beginning of a theory.<eos> Come on, Angie...<eos> You need more than that.<eos> You just got back.<eos> So why cross the man who's got the deputy chief's ear?<eos> Because the Montgomerys are hiding something, and you know how I feel about secrets.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> - No, it's too late.<eos> - Been doing it for months.<eos> You guys are gonna bankrupt me.<eos> - Paleo burger, please.<eos> - Two, please.<eos> And a diet root beer.<eos> What planet am I on?<eos> I got to get down to the range.<eos> Yes, you do.
No judgment.<eos> What'd you have?<eos> Oh, let's just say it was one of teenage Angie's many bad decisions.<eos> So a butterfly over a guy's name?<eos> Care Bear?<eos> That hurts my feelings.<eos> You were not kidding when you promised long hours.<eos> Well, it's a glamorous life.<eos> Let's order in.<eos> Already did.
You -- you have to find a way to fix this.<eos> There's no fix.<eos> There's no reverse.<eos> It's your lifelong dream.<eos> It's lifelong.<eos> I can't live like this.<eos> My insides feel like gravel.<eos> I cut myself when I move.<eos> [ crying ] I can't live as this repulsive creature.<eos> Then don't.
This is temporary, Skye.<eos> I'll be back in a couple days.<eos> - If you need anything...<eos> - I'll let you know.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I promise.<eos> Captain Andersen.<eos> I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy.<eos> - I don't have a daughter, sir.<eos> - No, you do not.
Uh [clears throat] these are for you.<eos> I want to thank you... Both of you... For giving me another shot.<eos> I know that my actions...<eos> I learned who my mother was today,<eos> And she... Taught me things.<eos> I've never had that before.<eos> That was possible because of you.<eos> That's all I really wanted for you.<eos> Cal, uh, Skye doesn't know when her birthday is.<eos> I do.
- Because of me.<eos> I asked him to go and protect you, to keep you safe.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I should never have let you go at all.<eos> It was the right thing to do.<eos> We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I've seen here... th-the safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> - How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> - We don't.
I'm surprised you didn't join us.<eos> I thought it might be in my best interest to find an exit that wouldn't, oh, land me in a cell afterwards.<eos> Or, you know, my brain erased.<eos> Well, I'm glad you made it out all right.<eos> Yeah, we both know that's not true, Coulson.<eos> You want to tell me what this call's really about?<eos> I always knew the team wasn't gonna forgive me.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> But Kara?<eos> She does.
Just don't hurt him.<eos> Skye, where are you?<eos> Skye?<eos> - I got Neapolitan and vanilla.<eos> - Uh, you pick.<eos> She left the line open for us. We'll have the location in a minute.<eos> - She doesn't sound like a hostage.<eos> - More like she's playing along.<eos> Mack and I can take a team... go get them.<eos> Do it.
- Look, the bar codes<eos> - Sod the bar codes!<eos> That lad confessed to the murder of Dawn Ashworth,<eos> - and we know he killed Lynda.<eos> - OK, Dr. Jeffreys -<eos> Dr. Jeffreys is talking through his arse!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Right. Alec, I want you to run the same tests on the samples we've got from Dawn Ashworth.<eos> - I thought you had a confession.<eos> - We do!
We can't let this happen to anyone else.<eos> No.<eos> What time are you back, love?<eos> Not late.<eos> Is Danny walking you home?<eos> Flippin' hope so!<eos> See ya, Mum.<eos> I fucking saw you in there, Danny!<eos> You didn't see a thing.<eos> Yes, I did.
Previouslyon "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> - Why should I trust you? - Coulson:<eos> Because we all have our secrets.<eos> You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness. - Kara?<eos> - She does.
Kara needs closure.<eos> Admit that you betrayed her, and we can end this.<eos> You're such a hypocrite.<eos> You say I betrayed her?<eos> You betrayed your entire team.<eos> How many people who trusted you have died?<eos> See, I've seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside.<eos> He's a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - Sure, I do.
Tell your friends.<eos> Free spaying and neutering, too.<eos> Just ask for Dr. Winslow. I'm sorry.<eos> And you are...<eos> Daisy.<eos> That's a lovely name.<eos> Remember, a house is not a home without a pet!<eos> Thank you for doing that for him.<eos> I know aspects of the Tahiti program don't sit well with you.<eos> - This does.
I don't know.<eos> Are those my only two options?<eos> - In the paternity pool, yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> Hi, Helen.<eos> I'm Dr. Dey.<eos> Whoopee for you.<eos> Can you tell me why you're so upset right now?<eos> I made a mistake coming here.<eos> No, you didn't.
Not like this.<eos> What kind of Wesen are we dealing with?<eos> A Matanga Zumbido.<eos> I told you.<eos> It was a Mata-something.<eos> I was close.<eos> If I had known what he was before I told him about Theo and Patty,<eos> I'm not going back in that house.<eos> Something killed Raymond.<eos> Yeah. Something did.
Something killed Raymond.<eos> Yeah. Something did.<eos> That's why we're not going back in that house.<eos> I'm not leaving Portland until I find out what did this.<eos> We're Ghost Seekers.<eos> It's what we're supposed to do!<eos> I never thought any of this was really real.<eos> Well, now we have proof that it is, and you want to run away.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You were working the fucking case?<eos> I was working the fucking case, and I saw Calista last night.<eos> What the... where is she?<eos> Retro Girl has her.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> Calista jumped off the Tower, and Retro Girl caught her.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I know.<eos> The girl jumped off the Tower because she thought it might give her powers.<eos> It did not.
None of this publicity shit.<eos> He's planning something. I just... I can't...<eos> Fuck this cop shit.<eos> Give me something I can hit.<eos> I'm gonna ask you a question. - Can you for once...<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - ... just not...<eos> When you jumped, did you know Retro Girl was gonna save you?<eos> Yes, I knew.<eos> I did.
I froze.<eos> I got a conditional admission into Savannah College of Art and Design, and if I don't make Honor Roll this semester, they could completely withdraw my acceptance.<eos> I... I'm so sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I panicked, and I...<eos> Slow down, okay?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> - You're not?<eos> - No. But if you need a tutor--<eos> I don't. I...
I have Emily's number.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> I'm just gonna head home. - Okay.<eos> Thank you for the image of you in a hot dog costume.<eos> And everything else that you said.<eos> Yeah, anytime.<eos> I told Ezra about Savannah.<eos> I thought he knew.<eos> Yeah. I should've told him already.<eos> Why didn't you?
You opened it.<eos> You know how, uh, dangerous that could be?<eos> What's in the vial, Howard?<eos> Okay, you're angry.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> You know.<eos> We both know.<eos> I don't.
'Cause all those deaths are on me, too.<eos> The gas is called midnight oil.<eos> You designed a poison gas, Howard?<eos> No!<eos> Well, not intentionally.<eos> The army wanted something that would keep soldiers awake for days at a time, but it failed.<eos> Caused symptoms similar to sleep deprivation...<eos> Anger, hallucinations, psychosis.<eos> If you knew all that, why use it in Finow?<eos> I didn't.
Business may continue?<eos> In the best possible way... uninterrupted.<eos> So, uh, what are you going to do with it when it arrives?<eos> What, you think I'm a doddering pencil pusher who moves enormous amounts of money with no clue as to what it's connected to?<eos> The numbers are like tea leaves.<eos> Nobody reads them like I can.<eos> You're laying out major reserves to clear the docks... to make sure the police don't come within 10 blocks.<eos> More to bribe the comptrollers to guarantee straight greens.<eos> Know how much all that costs?<eos> I do.
But he ain't around no more.<eos> One year after he got voted in, packed up, got himself a real house.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like we're gonna buy.<eos> This city?<eos> It's everything.<eos> It's right there.<eos> All you gotta do is put your mind to it and make it happen.<eos> You want a sip?<eos> - He most certainly does not.
Shut up!<eos> No, please!<eos> Shut up! I don't wanna hear it!<eos> - I lost because of you!<eos> - No!<eos> - Because of this family.<eos> - No! They see it!<eos> They see you and that little bastard and they laugh!<eos> - And you don't believe in me!<eos> - I do.
With things like this?<eos> Not today.<eos> I think I've had enough.<eos> - Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Matt.<eos> Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us...<eos> Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
I don't know... a girl, maybe?<eos> See?<eos> This is what I'm talking about.<eos> Me and you...<eos> Maverick and Goose, no secrets.<eos> Goose died... and he was married.<eos> Details.<eos> Hey, do you know a good place to get a cup of coffee on campus?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, lucky for you, I do.
I made a mistake.<eos> I know that.<eos> Misspelling "Hanukkah" is a mistake.<eos> Attempted murder is a little something else.<eos> You ever stop to think what would happen if you went to jail?<eos> You really think that anyone would believe that I didn't know what you were doing?<eos> That Karen didn't know?<eos> This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.
A very rough patch.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Yeah... but I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's...<eos> If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
Consider it an asshole tax.<eos> - That's bullshit.<eos> - You're bullshit!<eos> Jed, Jed! Back off, or I'll put a bullet in your eye!<eos> Put the gun away, Jed. Put the gun away.<eos> We're all done, so just take the suitcase to the car, okay?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> So you think you know me now?<eos> You think you know Hillary?<eos> 'Cause you don't.
Took him down to the ER.<eos> Turned out he got an allergy to the dog all of a sudden.<eos> You ever deal with that?<eos> Uh, yeah, sometimes that can happen, yes.<eos> That night I get home from the hospital.<eos> Old Leo rushes up to see me, tail wagging, tongue out, rolls over on his back like he always did.<eos> And I put a bullet through his head.<eos> My boy... He's everything to me.<eos> The man who helps him, that man's my brother.<eos> The man who doesn't...
It's not too late.<eos> Walker?<eos> I had to try.<eos> This shit is gonna kill you. - Okay.<eos> Okay. - Get it off.<eos> Okay. Okay. - Wait.<eos> - Deena.<eos> Wolfe... begged us, me and Johnny...<eos> He begged us to kill him.<eos> And we didn't.
I come up behind.<eos> Tickle her back.<eos> Pull that scrunchie out. Yeah, get the hair down.<eos> Pick up the pace, pick up the pace.<eos> Sorry, buddy.<eos> Had to light my cigar.<eos> Show was just starting.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Nah, you didn't see nothing.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You're happier on the outside, looking in.<eos> Probably.<eos> Do you work?<eos> Me?<eos> I never want to work again.<eos> Oh, shit! I have to go.<eos> I'm meeting Jon for lunch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.
Do you work?<eos> Me?<eos> I never want to work again.<eos> Oh, shit! I have to go.<eos> I'm meeting Jon for lunch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> You didn't, did you?
Just down on the left.<eos> Sorry, I meant right, not left.<eos> - Wine?<eos> - Sure. Thanks.<eos> I like you smart.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just seeing how far away Jon is.<eos> Where did you go when you went away?<eos> Jon has a lake house.<eos> We did a ritual.
I... yes...<eos> No!<eos> You mustn't speak!<eos> I thought I had made that clear.<eos> If you speak, I will have to cut out your brother's throat.<eos> Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
Yeah.<eos> You rang?<eos> How do you talk down a guy in a bomb vest?<eos> And spare me the jokes.<eos> Okay, well, I knew a guy on the force.<eos> He had it rough.<eos> Talked about eating his gun.<eos> The one thing he said, he never felt so alone.<eos> So how did you convince him that he wasn't?<eos> I didn't.
- Did I get any mail?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> You know, I think it might be easier for the DNC to just move in.<eos> Hello, chef. Tell us what you're making today.<eos> It's personal lubricant.<eos> - Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.<eos> - Join the club, honey.<eos> And you're using this, like, for... adult lubricating purposes?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, we both do.
Robert's gonna kill me.<eos> And I should probably let him.<eos> I'm so embarrassed.<eos> Don't be.<eos> Anybody could have made that mistake.<eos> What am I gonna do about your wedding?<eos> - It can't be easy for you.<eos> - It's not.<eos> I got so caught up in not being invited, I never thought about whether I actually wanted to go.<eos> Do you?
- Can I buy your yogurt? - I already paid.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bring your big treat.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> At Larry's funeral, I said something about being stuck with you,<eos> - I don't even know if you heard me...<eos> - Oh, I heard you.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> - Yes, you did.
That's the best part.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.<eos> Claire Underwood.<eos> We need to hit her hard.<eos> You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
In a heartbeat.<eos> We're different people.<eos> You should go.<eos> Put this behind you.<eos> I guess it was naive to think that we could remain close.<eos> So this is it?<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
Never.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I feel like...<eos> Like I'm in a dream, and if I could just wake up, my dad would be alive.<eos> I can't believe he's really gone.<eos> Look...<eos> When terrible things happen, you have to remember to look forward.<eos> He didn't deserve to die.<eos> I know what will cheer you up.<eos> I do.
I-I came across this place, and Foster took me in.<eos> what's up with this coat?<eos> You've gone from lady scav to, like, scientist?<eos> Five years?<eos> I know.<eos> No, I'm a lab tech. I'm just helping out.<eos> I thought I'd...<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> I had to leave.<eos> You didn't.
She did this, I know she did.<eos> - She's controlling him somehow.<eos> - OK, OK, what... what do we need to do?<eos> I'm going back to Jaegar.<eos> She's going to fix this, or I'm going to break her, a piece at a time.<eos> You stay here.<eos> Watch your brother, he's... he's in the cargo hold.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Hi, Johnny.<eos> What the hell did you do to her?
I should probably let him rest.<eos> Maybe tomorrow.<eos> I destroyed all of Jaegar's research and equipment...<eos> I don't care about that right now.<eos> How are you even looking at me?<eos> Do you remember much of it?<eos> Dutch, I remember everything.<eos> Please tell me you know I would never do anything to hurt you or John.<eos> Please tell me you know that that wasn't really me.<eos> I do. Of course I do.
Take Sinoh and go inside.<eos> Hm?<eos> Man, you got a lot of guns.<eos> Define "a lot."<eos> Well, it means more than a few.<eos> That's right.<eos> I have more than a few guns.<eos> Speaking of guns, you shouldn't be shooting off guns around here. It attracts too much attention.<eos> He didn't fire a gun. I did.<eos> Yeah, you did.
What did you do with that photo?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Why did you take them, Casey?<eos> Nathan practically begged me to!<eos> And it was just that one.<eos> Now, now, Casey.<eos> Pants on fire, I counted five, at least.<eos> Nathan, if this is you... I'll tell everyone what you told me your mum did on holiday in Weston-super-Mare!<eos> I could've put that in the tweet, but I didn't!<eos> What did Nathan's mother do on holiday in Weston-super-Mare?
They tell their sad story...<eos> Why do they take so long over it?<eos> My parents are divorced,<eos> I didn't subject the world to my singing voice.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I didn't know any of this.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's fucking terrible.<eos> ~ I don't need to watch any more.<eos> ~ Yes, you do, Casey.
What was all that about?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> You guys were actually agreeing.<eos> You both want me to make a decision.<eos> And that's your decision?<eos> To let him pay for everything?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I mean, if I decide to take the internship, I'm gonna keep waitressing.<eos> I'm not afraid of hard work, you know that.<eos> Rafael doesn't.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> I just wanted to apologize.<eos> I was really rude last night.<eos> I overreacted and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> Things just escalated.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much.<eos> - She doesn't.
No one gets on this floor unnoticed.<eos> - The windows are too big in here.<eos> - Mother!<eos> Draw the blinds, Magda.<eos> All right.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> Don't be rude, mother.<eos> He's the only person who's helping us.<eos> And I still don't trust him.<eos> Well, I do.
I'm leaving now, mom, but I want to see you later at Calle Ocho at 4:00.<eos> I'll see you at Calle Ocho.<eos> _<eos> Meet you at 4:00.<eos> - Aah! Oh! Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to give you this.<eos> It's everything I loved about your story.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> Please. No, please, I do.
What was the long-term plan?<eos> Did you talk about it?<eos> Well, not specifically.<eos> Xiomara, you had a little girl.<eos> You got to raise her.<eos> Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> - You do?
She's on her way home.<eos> What?<eos> No one disrespects the woman I love.<eos> You love me?<eos> I do.<eos> But what about all that stuff that she said?<eos> Who cares if your eggs are too old?<eos> We'll buy fresh ones. Combine my DNA with anyone, and the child will be extraordinary.<eos> I love you, Xiomara.<eos> I do.
I just wasn't in a talking mood.<eos> And I'm definitely not in the mood for a lecture.<eos> No one's lecturing.<eos> I've-I've just been... thinking about things. Overthinking. Letting my doubts get in the way instead of believing you.<eos> I know you're not your father. Well, maybe I am.<eos> And why is that a bad thing?<eos> He was there.<eos> He provided for me.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
"I thought it was very strange.<eos> "But now I know a bellboy was murdered.<eos> "I have a bad feeling, Rose,<eos> "about my father.<eos> You need to get away, Rose, right now."<eos> You have been acting so strange since I got back.<eos> I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.
"But now I know a bellboy was murdered.<eos> "I have a bad feeling, Rose,<eos> "about my father.<eos> You need to get away, Rose, right now."<eos> You have been acting so strange since I got back.<eos> I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.<eos> Of course I do.
You didn't read the e-mail?<eos> (Sighs) She's there to navigate the birth.<eos> She takes care of the mother as far as I can tell.<eos> Like, pain management...<eos> - Downside?<eos> - Expensive.<eos> Fine, it's no problem, I know. But it's a consideration.<eos> Also there's another person in the room during the birth... do you want that?<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you?
Bora bora?<eos> When are you going<eos> To get your life together?<eos> Look at your sister. Even she is on the right path.<eos> Luisa: No, thank you.<eos> I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics Either end up in rehab, in jail or dead.<eos> I chose rehab.<eos> There is no need to give them every single detail, luisa.<eos> In any case, you need a job.<eos> No, I really don't.
Where there were fireworks. Latin lover narrator:<eos> Sounds like gibberish to me, But clearly it meant something to luisa.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> I shouldn't have knocked on that door, And I should have trusted you enough to wait And ask you what was going on.<eos> But, I mean, can you blame me, really?<eos> I mean, with everything that's going on-- I mean, the murders and twins and mastermind criminals, This is not normal stuff.<eos> It's pretty friggin' crazy.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> But even with all that, I thought that you trusted me.<eos> And I do.
So you two are gonna tell each other How you feel honestly right now.<eos> Go.<eos> Okay, mom, you go first.<eos> Rogelio is...<eos> Dad?<eos> Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
Because you've voted in two elections.<eos> It was time you understood the process.<eos> Mom...<eos> What does love feel like?<eos> Why?<eos> Just curious.<eos> How do you know for sure you're in love?<eos> It sort of feels like...<eos> Your heart is glowing, if that makes sense.<eos> It doesn't.
- _ - (bell dinging)<eos> It's not a trap.<eos> I just want you guys to talk to each other,<eos> - and I want you to leave me out of it.<eos> Talk.<eos> Ma. Now's your chance.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry I kissed Marco.<eos> It was stupid and immature, and-and I've replayed it, like, a million times in my head, and I wish... you have no idea how hard I wish I could take it back.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I really do.
- (phone vibrating) - (sighs) _<eos> Jane (recorded): You've reached Jane.<eos> Leave a message. (beep)<eos> Hey, Jane.<eos> I'm just calling 'cause I wanted to let you know that I asked Petra to fire Magda.<eos> So I'm doing everything I can.<eos> I just don't want you to worry.<eos> Latin Lover Narrator: And briefly, she thought he'd say, "I love you."<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> But alas, he didn't.
So I didn't go to the meeting. And they sold the company.<eos> Your dad's company? Yeah.<eos> And I'm glad, because somehow with my mom being so awful,<eos> What you were saying before was right.<eos> I don't want his life.<eos> He wasn't a good dad.<eos> I don't want to be anything like him.<eos> And I won't be.<eos> And I just want you to know that.<eos> I do.
You look good.<eos> God, what the hell am I saying? You look great.<eos> Honestly, Cass, it's great to see you back on your feet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, you got another one of those?<eos> I was worried about you, Cass.<eos> - Well, you don't have to be any more.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Damn it, you didn't have to leave.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I told you.<eos> Henri told me how to find the Night Room.<eos> You saw me there, didn't you?<eos> Yeah. I stayed away.<eos> I had to follow Henri without you there.<eos> Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you... outside the tents that night... the lights.<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
Maybe we're not supposed to.<eos> Do it.<eos> - Start it up.<eos> - No!<eos> Stop this right now.<eos> - Stand down.<eos> - Marcus, put the gun away.<eos> I gave up everything for you and this thing.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - It did work.
But I can still feel them in my mind.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Your synaptic activity appears normal.<eos> You should be fine. Well, I'm not... am I?<eos> You know, the other you told me to ask you about the cost of all this, sacrifice.<eos> Every time I splinter, it feels like I'm being ripped apart from the inside.<eos> Eventually I'm not coming back, am I?<eos> If you succeed, it doesn't matter.<eos> No.<eos> But if I don't?
I am a realtor now!<eos> Ashley Alexander from Red Door Realty says that I'm a tough negotiator.<eos> Also, I found out what ruined the Millers' marriage.<eos> Male infertility.<eos> No motorcycles for you three!<eos> Jessica, you can't just say you're a realtor.<eos> You gotta take an exam, get a license.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Also, you can learn how to sell a house...<eos> Which I already did!
So what's wrong with you?<eos> Why hasn't someone snatched you up yet?<eos> Oh. It's work.<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know you're on a date, but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.<eos> Sir, please, you have everything to live for.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Mm hmm. How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me?<eos> You would have had to have tested it specifically.<eos> Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?<eos> Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah... I do.
I'm not gonna try and convince you with promises.<eos> But, Detective, give me a chance.<eos> I think we already know what you're capable of, Doctor.<eos> You hurt a lot of people that night.<eos> So those doctors in there, they're good enough?<eos> The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
I spoke to Cate.<eos> ~ Is she still drinking?<eos> ~ A bit, yeah.<eos> I assumed that was since the deaths, but was she always like that?<eos> I don't want to speak ill of her - not after everything she's been through - ~ but she always had a posh glass of wine in her hand.<eos> Made sure you knew it was expensive.<eos> Maybe it was because we were renting off them, but I just... always felt she was looking down on us. Lee she just flirted with, but everybody flirts with Lee and he just flirts right back, so...<eos> You don't think... Did they ever have a thing?<eos> I hate her.<eos> Sorry, but I do.
It's always been you.<eos> ~ What has?<eos> ~ You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm in love with you, Maggie.<eos> Ever since you came here.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that now?<eos> Do you really think I didn't know?<eos> ~ Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> ~ Because you never did!
I'm gonna make you say it.<eos> There's a question from the jury. We're going back in.<eos> The jury have asked to see a photograph of the view from the window of the clifftop hut.<eos> We will get copies to you straight away.<eos> And the second question is to clarify... .. to clarify whether Mark Latimer was ever questioned by the police as a suspect.<eos> Erm... Yes, he was.<eos> He was arrested for obstruction and spoken to in connection with Danny's death.<eos> ~ If they're asking those questions...<eos> ~ Doesn't necessarily mean anything.<eos> Of course it does.
You want that? We can do that.<eos> Say the word.<eos> That's not why you're here, is it?<eos> You're here because of Lee.<eos> So, what are you thinking?<eos> We bring Lee in. He gets a fright, seeing that.<eos> And then, instead of betraying you... .. you're banking on him realising that he needs to stay close to you<eos> ~ because of what you know.<eos> ~ I don't know anything!<eos> ~ I don't!
Why did you have to buy it again?<eos> I didn't get enough.<eos> This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.<eos> Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.<eos> 'Those are dark-oak floorboards. What's down there now is light oak.'<eos> Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No. Something did.
~ Why would I ever want to work with you again?<eos> Because I bring prestige, which matters.<eos> Don't protest!<eos> I'm brilliant.<eos> I'd be your conscience, challenge what you do, and I still think you need that.<eos> I think you're wrong about the law.<eos> I understand why, but it is a calling. It is noble.<eos> And I think... you need to get that back.<eos> ~ I don't need a tutor.<eos> ~ Yes, you do. We all do.
Stay with us.<eos> You stay with us, Thomas.<eos> Okay?<eos> You don't go anywhere.<eos> You stay with us, you hear?<eos> You hear me?<eos> Stay with us.<eos> This is how he did it.<eos> He lured his brother here knowing the lightning was gonna strike.<eos> And when it did...
(Woman) # Tangled up # I'll do whatever I have to do, please.<eos> ♪ Than to fall ♪ How long has it been going on with you and Andy?<eos> You know you left this here, right?<eos> I've been using it for bicep curls.<eos> Oh, yeah, right, I got a test on Monday.<eos> Should I not have come over?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'm just wiped from the weekend.<eos> R.E.M did a two-hour encore.
You don't have to explain yourself.<eos> You're doing what you feel is right.<eos> Just not sure if I could do it.<eos> Guillermo downstairs let me up.<eos> I think he's in love with me.<eos> Libby, you look great.<eos> Oh, thanks, sis.<eos> I'd look better with a drink in my hand.<eos> Well, you know where the bar is.<eos> - I do.
Hey... no, no, no, please.<eos> Take Becca out to a nice dinner.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Just a suggestion.<eos> Sore winner.<eos> Mrs. Brady wanted me to get you for dinner.<eos> What's up?<eos> I want to leave.<eos> Just tell Mrs. Brady I feel sick.<eos> Do you?
Just slowly..., steadily... grinding away at my soul.<eos> Trying to make me... disappear.<eos> That's not kid stuff.<eos> But to be fair to them..., they simply never understood me.<eos> They have no clue... who I am.<eos> Even when I was killing them, they just gaped at me... like fools.<eos> No understanding.<eos> Jason Lennon... killed your parents.<eos> You didn't kill them.<eos> Yes, I did.
Come on, come on.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill each other, is that what you want?<eos> Listen to me... you have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.<eos> Don't lose yourself, don't lose who you really are and what really matters to you!<eos> Tumor's buried in the occipital lobe reaching into the fourth ventricle.<eos> How's he supposed to get that out?<eos> Heck, I don't know, but he's got to try.<eos> Okay, tell the surgeon I'm sending him a scan and a roadmap on how to proceed.<eos> Who did the map?
The patient.<eos> It's a long story, please, just go.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's scared, you know, but he's got a fighting chance, but it's a pretty risky operation.<eos> But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
I need to find a special place to stick it.<eos> Can you please tell her to say "rooster"?<eos> Nope.<eos> So what are we thinking?<eos> Dig right in, be done by lunch, or straight to the Dumpster?<eos> Hey, remember, she's my wife.<eos> And you're the one who insisted that we all live together, 'cause you're a great friend and a great roommate.<eos> I guess I have been pretty great.<eos> I don't know if I would say hero.<eos> No one did.
Ironically, the reason we found them was because we were digging a foundation for a new wing of our resort.<eos> And you're still gonna build there?<eos> We only have so much land.<eos> To not use every inch of it would be wasteful.<eos> When you're Chief, your responsibility's to the people, not the land.<eos> You talk a lot.<eos> Hazard of the profession.<eos> If you dig up the mountain where the Lenape are, you wouldn't find any of this.<eos> They have no real Indian ancestry.<eos> Yes, they do.
Look. For all we know, he's back at home.<eos> I just called my mom to check.<eos> Nobody there has seen him.<eos> I think he's still here.<eos> Why would Levi risk locking you up unless he was scared you were gonna find something?<eos> I think Junior already made his move.<eos> Levi's hand was bandaged.<eos> Okay. Let's suppose he did do something.<eos> We have no idea where to look for him.<eos> - I do.
That's just not true.<eos> I know that.<eos> But given everything that happened, it's pretty hard to make that case.<eos> Not if you and I can find the real coconspirator.<eos> Before Winthrop abducted my daughter, I was working on a lead.<eos> I figured his-his partner was helping him get the girls, the victims.<eos> Through the escort service.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I thought Rebecca Lowell ran Lady Aquarius.<eos> She did.
I'm tired of all the lies.<eos> Based on that conversation, I did a little digging around the Winthrop family tree.<eos> And it turns out that Collin Winthrop had a daughter.<eos> May.<eos> May went missing around age 15.<eos> Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.<eos> She just ran away.<eos> And, Brother Larson,<eos> I think you know where she ran to.<eos> I do not.
This is CSI Morgan Brody, requesting medevac assistance at my location.<eos> How you doing? One day at time.<eos> Isn't that what they say?<eos> So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend.<eos> Yeah, she's just not responsive.<eos> I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.<eos> Well, one thing we do know is that Winthrop is gonna recover, and when he does, he's gonna pay for what he's done. Right?<eos> Did Lab Director Nolan call you about that job? Oh. I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah, he did. He did, yeah.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Barry.<eos> We have to shut down the wormhole quickly!<eos> Caitlin!<eos> You didn't save her.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
- I don't know.<eos> Your boyfriend, who you're practically marrying, just left here.<eos> First of all, nobody's getting married, and second of all, I didn't kiss Byron, he kissed me.<eos> - What about the first time?<eos> - That one I might have participated in.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Honestly?<eos> It never occurred to me.<eos> I mean, I didn't think we were friends that told each other things like that.<eos> Oh, you didn't.

For when it gets cold out.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Yes, you did.
It's a little scary, actually.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Yeah, I guess we both have something to be happy about.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know it's not how you wanted it, but you're Captain.<eos> You worked your ass off for this.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Grandma, you remember Phillip, don't you?<eos> How you doing?
You go to the cops, tell them what you know.<eos> That backs up my story.<eos> And then maybe if we're lucky, if we're very lucky, there's proof that Raul threatened Michaels and Lange, just like he threatened you.<eos> I don't want to shit on your pillow, boss, but we've got a couple of glaring problems.<eos> First, Travis is still out there wanting to put a couple of extra holes in your head.<eos> Then there's Cooper.<eos> A psycho ex- compadre who likes burning and blowing shit up.<eos> Doesn't mean Cooper's part of this.<eos> You wanna bet your life on that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'd turn in my badge, but that fucker's still got it.<eos> Could've happened to anybody, Crate.<eos> We'll get him, and get your badge back, too.<eos> When you do, use my gun.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> Merry Christmas, pally. Hm.<eos> "Fleas navi-dog," Harry.<eos> "Fleas navi-dog."<eos> You are feeling better.<eos> How you doing?
And I don't want to be your friend either, 'cause I like you.<eos> I mean... I like you, like you.<eos> But I'm getting on a bus bus.<eos> Stay!<eos> Logan is out of the triangle.<eos> It's now just a regular biangle.<eos> You mean a line?<eos> We need to work on your geometry, Kimmy.<eos> That's right.<eos> We do.
Man...<eos> "Get me something, Ava.<eos> Risk your life and then put them back."<eos> I swear this man's gonna drive me insane.<eos> Where the hell you been?<eos> Marshal took my car, left me on the side of the road.<eos> That's where the hell I've been.<eos> He took your car?<eos> He can't just take your car.<eos> What the hell did you do?
9, 10 years old.<eos> Peacocking around your daddy like you thought you was already a full-grown bad man.<eos> I recognize you now, Mr. Markham.<eos> That being said, I still don't recall being bounced on your knee.<eos> Nevertheless, it, uh, seems that I owe you an apology.<eos> Like I said, I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> No, sir. The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir. I did.
Those men coming after us like that.<eos> Ava, that ain't never gonna happen again.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't doubt you, Boyd.<eos> Good.<eos> Don't.<eos> But I do have to wonder, now that it's quiet... how much money are we talking about here?<eos> And how are you planning on going after it, given their actions?<eos> - I thought you said you trusted me.<eos> - I do.
Well, if you mean the notion to shoot me with that shotgun, I most certainly do.<eos> I have a problem that can only be solved with your wealth of expertise.<eos> Now... what say... we... we let the past fade off in the rearview and start anew?<eos> I just...<eos> Well, come on, Zachariah, I just want to talk to you!<eos> - Who in the hell was that again?<eos> - That's Ava's uncle.<eos> He and the other Randolphs never did forgive my deceased brother Bowman for how he treated Ava.<eos> Doesn't seem like that bottle's gonna get it done.<eos> No, it does not.
!<eos> - I... I can't hear shit.<eos> Now you think these virgins gonna make it through?<eos> 'Cause I'm thinkin' not.<eos> You gon' be all right!<eos> - Damn it, boy.<eos> - Goddamn.<eos> We're gonna have to let this vent for a few hours.<eos> Now after that '90 collapse over in Joseph's Valley, didn't I hear you swear up and down on your mama's grave that you'd never go in without a good sounding?<eos> I did, indeed.
But you are investigating it, right?<eos> You're not just gonna pin it on Tyler to close the case?<eos> No one's pinning anything on anyone.<eos> Emma, maybe you should take your friend to see one of those grief counselors.<eos> Hey, Audrey.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know. - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
I said, turn that off!<eos> Audrey, what did you do?<eos> Why'd you make me watch?<eos> I can't un-see that now. I can't.<eos> It can't be how it looks.<eos> You mean how it looks like premeditated murder?<eos> I mean it. I need, like, a Men in Black brain wipe.<eos> She was so angry.<eos> Noah, we both know Audrey.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I am a witness.<eos> If he did these things to hurt us...<eos> Then he's gonna have a reaction when he sees me.<eos> I need to look in his eyes.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Hello, Emma.<eos> Hi, Mr. Branson.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You know what I'm doing here.<eos> No, I don't.
She's fine.<eos> I know they're saying a lot of terrible things...<eos> But I did not kill Will.<eos> I don't even know where that knife...<eos> I'm sorry, but my lawyer...<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> Mr. Branson...<eos> Whatever your name is...<eos> Okay, my friends are dead, my family has been targeted, and you know why.<eos> Actually, I don't, Emma.
They caught him.<eos> Yeah, it's great news.<eos> I really should've called you back.<eos> You've had a lot on your mind.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you were okay.<eos> I am.<eos> I really am.<eos> Kieran... - After what happened to Will, I couldn't risk...<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
I don't know!<eos> Just listen to me, okay?<eos> Brooke, this whole thing...<eos> This whole thing is a mistake, okay?<eos> The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Why didn't you call me back?<eos> Well, I didn't feel much like talking after you accused me of murder.<eos> You wanna put that down now?<eos> No, we don't actually want to.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You texted me to meet you.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well, I didn't send this to myself.<eos> _<eos> Unless you did.
Please?<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> Officer Trotwood?<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Miss Borden, you might not remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
That's all I know.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, she had a couple of rough nights on the row, but she'll be okay.<eos> Who's coming to the party?<eos> Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
You hear something?<eos> Somebody back there?<eos> Huh, you want to spend the night in jail?<eos> You think I'm kidding?<eos> You want to do this the hard way, huh?<eos> Good morning, Miss Borden.<eos> We have some bad news.<eos> No... No!<eos> We don't know if he was singled out or he interrupted somebody.<eos> Somebody doing what?
Where's McLeod?<eos> ~ That's Aafrin's favourite, too. ~ Mmm.<eos> ~ More rice and he needs some curry. ~ Ma!<eos> You have to stop doing all that.<eos> It's up to you now to take good care of him.<eos> ~ Improve his time-keeping.<eos> ~ His bad breath in the mornings...<eos> Oh, please, Shamshad, I'm trying to eat.<eos> ~ Sita needs to know all about.<eos> ~ No, she does not.
- I need money.<eos> You can have my TV.<eos> Thanks, Malcolm. You keep it.<eos> - I stole it.<eos> - I figured.<eos> [Trish] Can we at least try to get Madeleine Albright?<eos> It's a lifestyle show, Trish.<eos> Our audiences tune out for politics.<eos> - They do not.<eos> - Okay, I do.
Yeah, I sure as hell am.<eos> If he gets a hold of me again...<eos> If you leave that girl with him, and...<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> What exactly should I do?<eos> We'll figure out a way to protect you.<eos> We?<eos> He's coming for me, not you.<eos> I know!<eos> You don't.
He says that you attacked him.<eos> Maybe I should call my lawyer first.<eos> Ma'am, I know who you are.<eos> And you should know that if I have to come back here with an arrest warrant, then the chances are this whole business ends up on the news.<eos> Which I'm sure that you're used to, but it wouldn't be my first choice.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer...<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Shit.<eos> Go home. Bandage yourself up.<eos> Forget this ever happened.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> Just tell me what the hell happened.<eos> Okay, why did I try to kill myself?<eos> Or why did I try and kill...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I killed...<eos> No. No, you didn't.
Trish, what are you up to?<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> - Well, if it involves Kilgrave...<eos> - Well, not yet.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It does?<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'm not gonna go anywhere near him.<eos> Which implies that you know where he is.<eos> I don't.
His powers don't work through a mic, so you'd have to go in the room.<eos> Don't do that, either.<eos> Uh-huh. Here you go.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> The cart on 41st Street has pastrami fries.<eos> I need you to witness something.<eos> I don't like what I see when you're around.<eos> Oh, you mean that room full of cops that put their own Glocks to their heads?<eos> I don't know what that was about.<eos> I do.
I thought maybe you were having it out with Wendy.<eos> - I was worried.<eos> - I should have called.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You brought him there.<eos> To make Wendy sign the divorce papers.<eos> That's not how it happened.<eos> Then tell me he made you do it.<eos> Just tell me that.<eos> He did.
That's not how it happened.<eos> Then tell me he made you do it.<eos> Just tell me that.<eos> He did.<eos> It was complicated.<eos> You did this.<eos> You told me to handle it.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> So you turn me into a murderer?<eos> I didn't do anything.
Just tell me that.<eos> He did.<eos> It was complicated.<eos> You did this.<eos> You told me to handle it.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> So you turn me into a murderer?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You chose to pick up that thing... and crush her skull.<eos> You did that.
So, not to point out the obvious, but you look good, not the Lamont I remember in high school.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I grew up.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Look, I lied back then when I said I joined Yearbook for the hot teacher.<eos> I joined for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I mean, I had the hugest crush on you.<eos> - You did not.
Brad's back there.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.<eos> Did we get him?<eos> Get him to the couch.<eos> Oh, shit. Shit. When did you even get a gun?<eos> - Why aren't we using it?<eos> - Give me your shirt, Freddie.<eos> - We didn't know who to trust.<eos> - And you do now?
- Was an alcoholic.<eos> - Still a loser.<eos> And you're a fucking serial killer.<eos> - Exactly my point.<eos> - It was high school, okay?<eos> It sucked.<eos> You graduate. You get over it.<eos> But John didn't graduate.<eos> I didn't ask that kid to put a gun in his locker.<eos> No. No, you didn't.
You don't understand, Maggie.<eos> You're out of your depth.<eos> Our kiss... threw me for a loop.<eos> But I see now that it may have caused you pain, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for harassing you about Herschel and...<eos> I'm orthodox.<eos> I live with a whole host of expectations.<eos> This isn't about just our kiss.<eos> - No, I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
If Milhouse can play, anyone can play.<eos> Once again, I'm the lower bound.<eos> You're it!<eos> Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?<eos> Well, there's nothing in the rule book against it.<eos> It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Yes.<eos> Yes?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> But, uh...<eos> About that house next door...<eos> - Grey House.<eos> It's one of the oldest in town.<eos> It's got quite the history.<eos> Wait till you meet the owner.<eos> He already did!
Good.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a super stellar intergalactic portable protection device that I bought for dad to protect him.<eos> I guess somewhere inside of me, there's still a ten-year-old girl who thinks this pin will protect you.<eos> Just be careful, ok?<eos> What?<eos> This... this pin...<eos> It's very "Cassie" of you.<eos> I know you didn't steal Harry.<eos> I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Marisol talks about you all the time.<eos> You've been together a while.<eos> Since freshman year.<eos> Kyle and I met in high school.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> Let me guess. You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As.<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I'll give you till the count of ten.<eos> - One...<eos> - It's a mistake.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> - Two...<eos> - What choice do we have?<eos> - Three...<eos> - How do we know this isn't just a lie?<eos> - Four...<eos> - We don't.
But, you know, I mean, it's like Vincent, he's always had this way of charming my dad.<eos> I-I can never match that.<eos> That must've been tough for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I was...<eos> I was the good student.<eos> I was the straight As, the valedictorian, and Vincent, he just has this charisma, so then my dad pays all this attention to him.<eos> It's always the same, you know?<eos> I'd come up with the ideas for the farm and then Vincent takes credit for it.<eos> Still does.
And seriously... who could forget this face?<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You did the right thing today.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter;<eos> I'm already damned.<eos> I know you don't want to talk about it, but does this have anything to do with the letter the Devil mentioned?<eos> Somehow, he managed to get all the charges against me dropped.<eos> Look, even if he did something for you, you don't owe him anything.<eos> None of us do.
I don't know what happened then, but I was panicked and scared, and when I suddenly came to, it seemed like I was being attacked by a stranger.<eos> Then I felt a power surge from my body.<eos> Sir, I need you to remain...<eos> They grounded the flight in Houston, then took me in for questioning.<eos> I couldn't explain anything, but they had no proof.<eos> My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll watch after Nadia.<eos> Listen, Raul... all we have in all of this is each other.<eos> And who knows how long we'll even have that?<eos> The whole world's in danger.<eos> No one's safe, anywhere.<eos> So if Peter has feelings for Nadia, and she has feelings for him... don't stand in the way, okay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You mind if I come in?<eos> Now you ask.<eos> How you doing?
No bigger than seven foot tall and no more than 15 bob.<eos> Pat!<eos> Where on Earth have you been?<eos> Didn't want to knock on the door. Didn't want to be asked in, to see you for the first time with everybody watching.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I need to change out of my uniform.<eos> I couldn't write at all to begin with.<eos> Not for the first month.<eos> But after that, I sent three letters. My mother posted them.<eos> Or maybe she didn't.
Do you guys wanna go see it?<eos> All right!<eos> Pop "Grease 2" back in its case.<eos> This saturday night just turned itself around.<eos> Wow! It's like the Emerald City, but more umber-y.<eos> It's like the Earth-Tone city.<eos> So there's the trailer me and my dad work out of.<eos> And there's the high security area.<eos> Only certain people have access to it.<eos> I do.
Comes to a ditch, drives a pole in to help him cross damn thing breaks, and there he is face down in a foot of mud, drowning.<eos> If a servant hadn't pulled him out... Who would reign then?<eos> He has one child born in wedlock.<eos> What, Mary, the talking shrimp?<eos> - She'll grow up.<eos> -I'm still waiting.<eos> Head's the size of my fingernail.<eos> And a woman on the English throne flies in the face of nature.<eos> A woman can't lead an army.<eos> Her grandmother did.
You won't find it so easy passing your bills through the House of Lords.<eos> Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope, and not afraid to say so.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Archbishop Warham, this, uh, prophetess you harbour in your diocese, Eliza Barton.<eos> How's she getting on?<eos> What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who was controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl, but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
That's why I'm always telling you to live your life, regardless of this crap.<eos> What happened last night, how you felt, what you said... that is life.<eos> And now that it's out, it's a good thing.<eos> Yeah, it doesn't feel so good.<eos> It will, with time.<eos> You have enough secrets, Cat.<eos> Being mad at your mom shouldn't be one of them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I still don't understand how infecting over, what, a dozen people, with a parasite that doesn't last very long accelerates their experiments.<eos> It doesn't.
Why would Korbell order a hit after an unsuccessful raid?<eos> I mean, it just calls more attention to him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The animal that escapes a snare doesn't necessarily go after the poacher.<eos> Okay, everyone, we can ask these questions in San Antonio.<eos> So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
You want him to burn. So do I.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have good reason to believe that Simon has been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> And I don't have proof yet, but I know he's working with an outside company, Ravenna.<eos> Ravenna?<eos> That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
I feel much better now.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> It was a purely technical huddle.<eos> I didn't want to waste your time.<eos> Look, if this is about yesterday...<eos> What about yesterday?<eos> What I said.<eos> You said what you were thinking, which I would encourage you to continue doing.<eos> Hard to stay encouraged when saying what I was thinking got me sat on the bench.<eos> It didn't.
Why are you doing this?<eos> I wasn't held enough as a child, or maybe it's because my amygdala's underdeveloped.<eos> I'm gonna get some cantaloupe.<eos> You want some?<eos> Babe?<eos> No. I'm good, thanks.<eos> Ok. Time to call your husband.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not a party without him, is it?<eos> I don't do it.
And soon I will have it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Withered by age and failure, yet your blind optimism carries you on.<eos> Don't tell me you still cling to your belief in the Supreme Being?<eos> - You should fear his wrath.<eos> - Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
Yes?<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Do you feel it all?<eos> Feel what?<eos> You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.

- Three weeks sounds like a long time.<eos> I could use 10 more like you.<eos> But instead of having 10 more, I'm down one because your story's bullshit, isn't it, Brasher?<eos> - Have you ready our statement?<eos> - I don't have access to the file, sir.<eos> It wouldn't matter if Bosch had backed your story.<eos> You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You do.

Detective Bosch initiated a sexual relationship with you against department policy.<eos> You need to report that<eos> - relationship and file a complaint.<eos> - A complaint? You felt pressured into the relationship because he was your superior... coerced.<eos> You thought it would hurt your career if you didn't comply.<eos> Well, technically, he wasn't my superior,<eos> - and I didn't feel pressured.<eos> - It was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy, was it not?<eos> How does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage?<eos> It doesn't.
- Everything okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't know!<eos> Why don't you ask Mr. Chica Cherry Cola over here.<eos> Okay, I am sorry that Savage Garden was the seminal band of my youth.<eos> Clearly you guys are under a lot of wedding stress.<eos> You're curating the ceremony, arranging the seating charts, not to mention figuring out what you're gonna wear.<eos> Hey, at least I got my tux already.<eos> - She still doesn't have a dress.<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - You don't.
It's like she's her muse.<eos> Every good artist needs one.<eos> So, how was Juliet?<eos> She's a drama queen, but let's not talk about her.<eos> Tonight is about you and me.<eos> And again, I am sorry we couldn't go back to my place.<eos> My lazy landlord is finally fumigating.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I just hope that my mom doesn't come home.<eos> Or actually, maybe I kind of do.
I just mean, I was...<eos> I used to worry that you would stay pissed at me about how everything went down with April.<eos> Or worse, that you were gonna swoop in and try and steal her from me.<eos> But that all seems kinda crazy now, doesn't it?<eos> You know, I always thought that "Phantom Menace" was the best "Star Wars."<eos> But you know, I get it, because you and April are just friends.<eos> And what's great, dimples... Dom...<eos> Domples, is that we can be friends now, because I have nothing to worry about.<eos> You don't want April back.<eos> - I do.
No, I'm sorry for discouraging you.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I just ran an entire 400 while you were getting water.<eos> What?<eos> You did?<eos> No, but you believed it for a second.<eos> It's not so hard to have faith, is it?<eos> Remember earlier you said you thought Leo was just in the ground?<eos> Do you really not believe in an afterlife?<eos> But you do?
You didn't.<eos> I just ran an entire 400 while you were getting water.<eos> What?<eos> You did?<eos> No, but you believed it for a second.<eos> It's not so hard to have faith, is it?<eos> Remember earlier you said you thought Leo was just in the ground?<eos> Do you really not believe in an afterlife?<eos> But you do?<eos> I do.
What about him?<eos> The more I think about it, the more I have this nagging feeling that...<eos> When he said goodbye to me for the last time...<eos> It's like he knew it was the last time.<eos> When we look back on big moments from our past we don't always remember them exactly the way they happened.<eos> No.<eos> He was so emotional.<eos> He cried. Dad never cried. I mean...<eos> Do you remember why he went to Baltimore?<eos> No, I don't.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> He loves you and misses you more than life itself.<eos> He thinks about you every moment of every dying day.<eos> He thinks about how you met at Colonel White High School.<eos> He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
We had a good laugh about it.<eos> Meeting went really, really well.<eos> Kevin is in fact leaving and they're only looking at one other guy, so I got a really good shot at it.<eos> That's great, honey.<eos> Yeah, that is great.<eos> I was very excited to share it with you last night when I got home. But you were out like a light.<eos> Anything you want to tell me?<eos> Anything at all?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Funny, when someone lies to you enough, you just stop believing anything they say.<eos> 'Cause all this time, I thought that I was crazy, and I'm not.<eos> And you let me.<eos> And I just realized I have no idea who you really are.<eos> What can I do to make it up to you?<eos> You're asking the wrong person.<eos> Our final question is a bonus round question.<eos> Which album was famously introduced as testimony in the Tate-LaBianca homicide cases, Los Angeles, in 1969?<eos> Also referred to as the "what" murders? The "what" murders?<eos> Simon. How you doing?
Come on, a-are you really serious about going through with this?<eos> Do you have a better idea?<eos> Than luring him out of town?<eos> No, but eloping?<eos> Okay, it's just a ruse, Vincent.<eos> It's a reason for us to get out of town so he doesn't think that it's a trap.<eos> Unless he thinks that's exactly what it is.<eos> But if he does, he's still gonna follow us, and we can control the where and the when.<eos> Okay, but what if we actually have to go through with this before he attacks us?<eos> Then we do.
He's not trying to kill us? I know.<eos> Might explain why we keep getting away from him.<eos> Yeah, but why would whoever's behind this want us back alive?<eos> I don't know, but whatever the reason is, I think he knows it's a trap.<eos> Look, maybe we should just head back, right?<eos> He's still following us. We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till death do us part.
Shh! They might hear you.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I don't know, but I think they might kill them, JT.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know;<eos> I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
Right now we three moves ahead of Ghost.<eos> Right where we want to be.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Hey, Jamie. This is a nice surprise.<eos> I have something for you. [ sighs ] Seriously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Come on. Open it. Open it.<eos> Open it. You really didn't need to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
Marco, I'm coming over.<eos> Yeah, a-all right.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That was Marco, my old army buddy.<eos> His son is dead.<eos> There is risk anytime we venture into the unknown, whenever we are compelled, for whatever reason... [camera shutter clicking] To push away the safety of the familiar, of family and home.<eos> As promised, my report.<eos> My assessment remains accidental death by drowning.<eos> And there is the notion that this impulse is, indeed, for the best, that whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger.<eos> Unless, of course, it does.
- Yeah, me too, pal.<eos> Me too.<eos> Marco, I think you should know Jason had intended to return Kevin Crachiolla's investment using his own money.<eos> Because you raised him right, Marco.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day? Come on, mom.<eos> [Chuckles, sniffles] I love you so much, Abraham. Henry:<eos> We both do.
Fine. But follow their lead.<eos> You got greedy, Chappy.<eos> You got greedy, and you killed Rick for that gold.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He was gonna split it with us.<eos> You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
Morgan -- Or whoever you are.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> Abe: So, this lady just pops up on the computer<eos> Mm. She's one of the faceless.<eos> She hacked my personal file.<eos> So, what does she want?<eos> Provide her with a fraudulent death certificate --<eos> Or else what?<eos> She'll go to the nypd, tell them that i'm a fraud.<eos> What do i do, abe?
And did you see the way everyone looked at us when you took my hand?<eos> No one was looking.<eos> Henry, you really are blind, aren't you?<eos> Yes. Since the moment I first saw you.<eos> Henry, look at us.<eos> We're ridiculous.<eos> A ridiculous love story.<eos> That what makes us so special.<eos> Look, I want to believe you, but every time I look at you...<eos> Then don't.
They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.<eos> No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?<eos> Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
Uh... I'm sorry. I guess, uh...<eos> I guess I got a little bit spooked by the lore of the knife.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You don't believe in some mystical knife!<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it. Further proof... Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.
Depending on how things unfold, this could become your farewell take-down.<eos> David?<eos> I think I was wrong.<eos> About what?<eos> Tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My mind is still all over the place, and you need time with Daniel's memories.<eos> And you wanna be with your daughter.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
After I lost my daddy, I...<eos> I had a hard time coping'.<eos> These made the pain disappear.<eos> Hmm.<eos> If they could only make my family disappear...<eos> Must be intimidating, having a brother in the political spotlight.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He, uh, inherited my father's Southern charm, so everybody loves Lyman.<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, of course I do.
I think the question is, why?<eos> What do they have to gain by you seeming crazy?<eos> As long as I'm incapacitated,<eos> Mother controls the inheritance that Daddy left me.<eos> See, she already burned through hers financing Lyman's campaign.<eos> Oh, and to think Lyman chose mental health funding as his platform.<eos> Oh, no, but we don't know he's involved.<eos> - Even the simplest implication would derail his career.<eos> This could've killed you, Louise.<eos> But it didn't.
Where did you get this?<eos> Nolan's house.<eos> Victoria asked me to find it for her.<eos> And in the state I was in, I just wasn't thinkin' clearly.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
- I'm not exactly prison material.<eos> - Shut up. Sorry.<eos> Thank you for bailing me out.<eos> Why did you bail me out?<eos> I went to see a friend.<eos> To vet my memory and your claims about Renautas on June 13.<eos> His place was a front for some kind of an operation.<eos> And then... he tried to kill me.<eos> Kill you?<eos> What did you do?
And I have to know why.<eos> No, I'm pretty sure Renautas was behind the whole slaughter.<eos> That's not what the world believes.<eos> You knew Mohinder Suresh.<eos> Was he capable of mass murder? No.<eos> But why is he running?<eos> Why is Renautas framing, disappearing, and killing evolved humans?<eos> That's why I came to find you.<eos> I figured if anybody had answers, it was you.<eos> Do you?

Listen, Hank, if my team needs something, I will tell you.<eos> So, who is she?<eos> Her name Johnnie, I told you.<eos> That's her real name?<eos> That's the name she go by.<eos> If you're so curious, why don't you just ask her yourself?<eos> Of course, that would require you to actually talk, or ride the bus with the rest of us.<eos> I talk.<eos> She don't even know you exist.<eos> Nobody does.
That's what I wanted to ask you.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> I don't like it when my teammates get hit.<eos> Same goes for my coach.<eos> Thank you, Tony.<eos> I think I'm gonna get hit no matter what I do.<eos> I got some tough decisions to make.<eos> You once told me that winning solves everything.<eos> I don't know if I believe that anymore.<eos> They do.
It was life-changing for me.<eos> It was unbelievable.<eos> So?<eos> So, what?<eos> Did you win?<eos> No, we did not.<eos> Look, I'll have these policies ready for you first thing in the morning.<eos> So, what's the answer?<eos> Do you believe in miracles?<eos> Yes, I do.
You know, I've got thousands of dollars worth of inventory rotting in that freezer.<eos> Over there!<eos> How have you kept your food cold with a broken freezer?<eos> We brought in 200 pounds of dry ice last night.<eos> Peter died of carbon dioxide poisoning.<eos> Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide.<eos> Oh, look who paid attention in chemistry.<eos> Oh, serious crush on my teacher, Mr. Brewer.<eos> That man knew his way around a Bunsen burner, if you know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
Now give me your information before I call the damn cops.<eos> I am the "damn cops."<eos> Oh, right. In a crappy old Volvo?<eos> It got a five star rating!<eos> Afternoon, officers.<eos> - Detectives.<eos> - Oh, detectives?<eos> Why'd you run me off the road, detectives?<eos> Why'd you run from us?<eos> I didn't.
But this is where things get interesting.<eos> Mr. Belson, there is language in this contract that the California Supreme Court has deemed unlawful.<eos> Preventing Mr. Dunn from seeking employment elsewhere is a violation of his rights.<eos> Are you aware of this?<eos> I was not, but I'm willing to drop that count altogether if it makes things easier.<eos> Well, here's the thing. This clause was unlawful when you included it in Mr. Hendricks' employment agreement.<eos> Right. As I said, I'm willing to just move past this.<eos> See, again, I don't think you understand.<eos> If Mr. Hendricks hadn't hired Mr. Dunn, or you hadn't pursued him for that hire, I'm not sure I would've noticed the violation.<eos> But you did, so I did.
What are you-- What am I doing here?<eos> I came back to fix things, all this.<eos> Help me, please.<eos> Where is my sister?<eos> My sister, Phoebe, Phoebe Frady-- where is she?<eos> This artery here, huh? You're bleeding out.<eos> I could call for help, but it's up to you. No, it's up to you.<eos> If you don't help me, you will never see your sister again.<eos> How am I supposed to know you'll let me see her, that you're not doing something terrible to her?<eos> You don't.
What's happening?<eos> Hey, I know you.<eos> Your husband saved my life.<eos> When everyone else ran, he came back, and he pulled me from the rubble.<eos> He's an honest-to-goodness hero.<eos> So, instead of saving Dennis... you saved one of them?<eos> Joanne, it wasn't like that, okay?<eos> I found him when I was looking for Dennis.<eos> He was buried. He needed help. I had to help him.<eos> No, you didn't.
No security.<eos> The only thing I could find was sewage pipes.<eos> Attack them from underneath.<eos> Yeah, it could work.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.
I got an e-mail today from a hacker.<eos> I'm pretty sure it was, anyway.<eos> It was encrypted.<eos> It turned out to be a top secret document. Taken from the CIA.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It describes a completely illegal arrangement between German and American intelligence.<eos> Germany's doing an end run around its privacy laws by having the US do the spying for them.<eos> That's what the doc says.<eos> Well, how do you know it's real?<eos> Well, I don't.
Sheikh Hafiz Al Haria is a very famous scholar.<eos> Please tell him it's urgent.<eos> Please wait here.<eos> Sheikh Hafiz will see you.<eos> Follow me, please.<eos> Will you take some refreshment?<eos> Thank you, I'll have what you're having.<eos> Coffee.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We do, the Foundation.
Actually, I can think for myself.<eos> I've always said that Kai was too dangerous to become leader of the coven.<eos> You've been wasting your time with Jo.<eos> We both know she's never gonna beat him.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> -Get what?<eos> -You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it.<eos> You're stronger than me.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
You're getting the big wedding you wanted, and I'm fine with that.<eos> - Just please let me have this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What if what's in my heart is very similar to a poem by Yeats?<eos> It's not!<eos> - A sonnet by Shakespeare?<eos> - No! - A greeting from Hallmark?<eos> - Not listening anymore!<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
I don't know what happened, but I'm connected to him.<eos> I got him back before, there must be a way to do it again.<eos> Have you felt anything since that night?<eos> And Wolfe is just sitting there, under that fucking Drainer.<eos> All that power... there has to be a way.<eos> If that's what you miss and that's why you want your powers back, you haven't changed as much as I'd hoped.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> If that's what I wanted, I could just tell everybody what happened.<eos> Then why don't you?
Have you got me on speaker?<eos> Oh, Josh, take me off speaker!<eos> Do you wanna be my boyfriend?<eos> Um, yeah, no, that's...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> What?<eos> No, it's good.<eos> - Do you not want to?<eos> - No, I do, I do.
Yeah! Oh, hi.<eos> Now, I... So, sometimes, I put my penis<eos> In your son's butt. But also, I mean, I do not litter!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, Sometimes he'd get shy at parties and hide under your dress.<eos> Yeah, well, I put my dick in his butt.<eos> Yeah. You know that one who you played little board games with, Sometimes you pretend to lose...<eos> Arnold loves board games.<eos> You know that son who you adopted And then you kept safe, and happy, and loved?<eos> Well, that actually worked out really well for me, yeah. 'cause sometimes, I get to put my dick in his butt.<eos> I do not!
Why would you slap his croquembouche?<eos> - Oh, croquembouche!<eos> All right, I'm gonna go.<eos> Enjoy your cake.<eos> I think it would be best if arnold wasn't here when I get back.<eos> You haven't had much to say, have you, josh?<eos> No.<eos> Is... Is he kicking me out?<eos> Don't worry, darling.<eos> You did a good job.
She's not gonna catch it, and that's not gonna help him.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he doesn't have a bug, Maggie.<eos> He's got stage-four lung cancer.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Then why does she think this is gonna help?<eos> 'Cause she doesn't know.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - Uh, it didn't.
Okay, step back.<eos> I got him. I got him.<eos> Oh, my god, is he having a heart attack?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Mike, what is...<eos> - Jackson, let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Hey, Travis. How you doing?
He's mom's friend.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Can you talk to mom so we can all come home?<eos> Your mother and I can't live together anymore.<eos> Can you ask her if I can come live with you?<eos> I'll help take care of you, dad.<eos> I can do stuff around the house.<eos> You'll see. It's not that simple.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Of course I do.
Not that night.<eos> All I'm saying is the institution of marriage started when life expectancy was 40.<eos> 40? !<eos> You'd have been dead.<eos> Think about that. It's crazy.<eos> It's a sham, gentlemen. It's a total sham!<eos> Whatever. Um, yeah, you know, you just ... you stay for the kids.<eos> You don't cut and run. Who does that?<eos> Ponytail, who does that?<eos> I don't.
I would just turn on a dime and go.<eos> Hey, you got it.<eos> - And now I'm going.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> Don't you have that dumb art gallery opening thing to do?<eos> Sean's opening.<eos> Are you gonna go?<eos> I got a part.<eos> - You got a part!<eos> - I did!
You slept with people.<eos> It's just... who cares? Let's... wait.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What do you mean, people?<eos> I mean, you slept with...<eos> Okay, I did not mean to have... we don't have time for this conversation right now.<eos> Okay, right, right, but how many people?<eos> - Joel.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Okay. But just for the record, I didn't...
Like, I think he literally might have shit himself.<eos> Did you shit yourself, Josh?<eos> No.<eos> Would you just mind your own business?<eos> I didn't...<eos> Who invited you here anyway?<eos> I'm-I'm running shit.<eos> - Did you shit yourself?<eos> - Would you just mind your own business?<eos> - You did, didn't you?
That's pretty good, yeah.<eos> - "This Friday's Eve"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's clever, it's quirky...<eos> - That sucks.<eos> - I've been in a long-distance relationship for three years.<eos> That's why you don't know anything.<eos> I have sex with women.<eos> - I know how to talk to women.<eos> - Do you?
Uh, Mom, this is the woman I came with, um, Kayla.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Uh, this is my girlfriend Kayla.<eos> So, "girlfriend," huh?<eos> Well, uh, sorry?<eos> Well, I just, I noticed back there you introduced me as your girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, so I did.
How's it going, fellas? - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How you doing?
- No, look, I'm sorry, but...<eos> Can I just see a doctor or call my parents?<eos> I just need a little help right now, and I...<eos> Please, can I just see a doctor or something?<eos> Hey, everything's gonna be all right.<eos> Listen, what I'm gonna do is, we're gonna clear out of this room, get a nice meal brought in here.<eos> If you're still feeling bad this afternoon, we'll call a doctor, okay?<eos> Okay, so I'm assuming that you've all seen and heard the mess that your fellow prisoner has created for us this afternoon.<eos> So I want you all to say now, after me,<eos> "Prisoner 819 did a bad thing."

I don't understand the question, sir. - I'm sorry.<eos> - Oh, you don't understand.<eos> 1965, you were picked up and later released on suspicion of car theft.<eos> 1969, you were picked up and later released for lack of evidence at a place where narcotics were found.<eos> 1970, you were arrested for passing bad checks.<eos> Now, you tell us that you can make it out there, but your behavior don't reflect it, nor do your behavior reflect it here.<eos> Now, I think that you're destined to be prison scum.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> You believe in God?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Thanks for walking me back.<eos> Well, if I'm going to be a proper gent, I should probably walk you to the door.<eos> Unless that sounds weird.<eos> No.<eos> That sounds fine.<eos> 'If that light goes on, I'll kiss her.'<eos> 'Turn on. Turn on. Turn on.<eos> Do you know, I think I actually know someone who lives round here.<eos> You don't know a guy called, um...<eos> Matt, do you?
You know you did the right thing today.<eos> There it is -- a hope speech.<eos> I thought we were drinking.<eos> It's not a speech.<eos> It's a compliment.<eos> Well, I don't need your validation. I know I did the right thing.<eos> I know because I'm miserable -- again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, so is Gold.<eos> It does.
Come on, Let's go again,<eos> As nice as it was otherwise ,<eos> And although I really like , The answer is no,<eos> Good night, Leif,<eos> Look at this, We took aerial photos of Rjukan yesterday,<eos> Here are pictures we took after the sabotage, Here are the new, There's something going on,<eos> They build it up again,<eos> - - We blew the whole room, -<eos> - It was not enough,<eos> What did we do wrong, then?
(chuckles) Eh, you'll get there, it's just mind over bladder.<eos> Oh, my God, is that blood on your shirt?<eos> Well, until the boys in the lab test it, we'll never really know.<eos> But right now all the evidence points to chili.<eos> Let me get that for you.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You're a mess.<eos> What are we gonna do with you?<eos> What the hell did you do?
(chuckles) God, I loved the power.<eos> Well, my dad was a cop, so I'm a cop.<eos> That's the only reason?<eos> Well, that and the uniform.<eos> I don't like thinking about what I have to wear every day.<eos> Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- Rita...<eos> You got people who care about you, I care about you.<eos> You know you're better than this.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Come on...<eos> - I said I don't do bitches!<eos> - Get outta my face before I cut you!<eos> - We got a problem?<eos> I told her I ain't no dyke!<eos> No, we don't.
Tell her what?<eos> That we're adopting the baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you shut the door?<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> Um... [clears throat] ... I... saw Ana at my dad's.<eos> Moms aren't gonna take her baby.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - No, I don't think she knows yet.<eos> Or maybe she does.
Kate. I know. I know.<eos> I'm just not letting myself think about it till we're through the woods on this, and you should... Probably do the same.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning you were struggling out there with that detective.<eos> What?<eos> I'm answering the questions. I'm... I'm selling the story.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I'm watching her react to you, and I'm telling you, if they get a hint that we're not being truthful, it's...<eos> Look, the point is, considering what you've been through, it's okay to tell them that you need a break.<eos> Except that I don't.
He stole $282 million from Baghdad in the middle of Operation Shock And Awe, abducted a CIA asset out of Iran during the '09 election protests.<eos> Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.<eos> The CIA announced his death two months ago.<eos> We say that about a lot of the inmates at The Factory.<eos> Truth is Braxton's being interrogated for secrets he stole from the Chinese, from the Iranians, us.<eos> Well, my money's on the fact that these two have a history together.<eos> Reddington, Braxton-- they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you're going to find out.<eos> Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> You do now.
It's what I'm good at, 'cause I understand demons better than most.<eos> We all have them, and all they need is a foothold to take control...<eos> Pain, fear, or even desire.<eos> Welcome back, sunshine.<eos> Can I get a glass of milk?<eos> The kind you like... make your ass real fat.<eos> Shit, did I do that to your neck?<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Abigail was still in control when I walked in that room.<eos> Please don't do that.
It made sense for me to leave Marty behind.<eos> And that was someone I loved.<eos> Because I understand that in order to get ahead and stay ahead, you have to cut ties.<eos> So I'm a dumb shit because I won't cut ties with Demark?<eos> Wow, you must have a big brain for science, because your people sense isn't exactly top-notch.<eos> And you hired a chief financial officer who cheated his way through business school.<eos> Though I suppose you can't be blamed for not digging through the official records of the Columbia University judicial board.<eos> They were never able to prove...<eos> But even when someone's profligacy and petulance is draining money from your pocket, you still don't see it.<eos> Or maybe you do.
Abraham was spying for Hewlett.<eos> No.<eos> No, it is the furthest thing from true.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> - Father, please.<eos> - Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.
And I need you to help me.<eos> Give this to my contact.<eos> That's all you have to do.<eos> What's this?<eos> Ya ba?<eos> Opium?<eos> You know half the patients at the clinic are addicts.<eos> It's for my son.<eos> It would cost me five years of my salary to pay for a year's treatment.<eos> And if I don't do it?
The view's better from back here.<eos> Go on, preacher man.<eos> Knock 'em dead.<eos> We're on in five, four, three...<eos> Does God want us to fear him? No!<eos> - Is that what you think?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so either, friends.<eos> See, my father's teachings show us that God, well, God just wants us to love.<eos> Yes, he does.

I don't know.<eos> Something just... feels weird.<eos> You mean besides the fact that we don't remember where we came from or what we did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't feel it?<eos> Do we really know everything about each other?<eos> That old Bronco outside, you say that it's practical, but it actually cost 300 a month just to keep it running.<eos> You keep it because you don't like to negotiate, and you don't want a new car.<eos> You love Patsy Cline, and you think that you sing "Crazy" pretty well.<eos> - I do.
You won't work.<eos> Why?<eos> To power the barn you need Aether activated in living form, me.<eos> I need more for the huge power necessary for a barn.<eos> The Aether needs a catalyst, a complementary energy to supercharge it.<eos> The same energy it has always needed, love.<eos> The energy it needed when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.<eos> - I...<eos> - You do not have that.<eos> I do.
You read from the text, didn't you?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> You made me...a destroyer.<eos> Yes.<eos> But don't you see?<eos> Out of the ashes, a new better world will arise.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You know how this works.<eos> Not you.<eos> Tell me this is your good side.<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, the serum appears to be holding.<eos> You are due another dose.<eos> What I still fail to grasp is my true motive.<eos> Cardinal Rodrigo was a man of the cloth.<eos> I had no quarrel with him.<eos> Well, perhaps you did.
You do.<eos> Mom, what's wrong with you? Mom...<eos> It's been confirmed that the disease is accelerating in Pretty Lake as the death toll mounts to over 300.<eos> There has been a frustrating lack of new information.<eos> The Department of Public Health has not issued any updates in the past week, though rumors have been swirling that a vaccine might be ready in the next few days.<eos> Eternal God, God of our mothers and our fathers, our God, we come before you today not in sadness or despair, but in joy and in confirmation.<eos> We come affirming...<eos> Stop it!<eos> We need to pray.<eos> No, we don't, Melissa.
Please, Stacey, I need your help.<eos> With what, Ronnie?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing. They think I killed Lana.<eos> And you didn't warn me?<eos> After I found it, it was too late to text you and...<eos> Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How? You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
What's wrong with you, Ronnie?<eos> When did you become a monster?<eos> You don't think it's the virus?<eos> - I hear Ms. Symonds, she...<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> I thought the government was just being paranoid. I thought we were done with all this virus shit.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But Vince doesn't have it.<eos> If he did, he'd be dead already.<eos> Hey, Vin. How you doing, buddy?
You said there would be nobody inside.<eos> You screwed up.<eos> (Barso) We need to talk about how<eos> - you're going to fix this.<eos> - Me?<eos> You killed them.<eos> You hired me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Now.<eos> No, we don't.
Now will you please help me with this before I poke my eye out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I'm nervous.<eos> Breathe. [Breathes deeply]<eos> - It's gonna go great tonight.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Because you're letting me. [Chuckles]<eos> (Kevin) Nobody knows what they're saying.<eos> (Lolly) Yes, I totally do.
Oh, you want to talk about cold?<eos> Lolly was in my room, crying, all night.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> I just... She caught me by surprise.<eos> I had no idea she felt that way.<eos> I know that look.<eos> Not even you believe what you're saying right now.<eos> What look?<eos> How do you know my looks?<eos> I just do.
Well, of course I was.<eos> And did you ever act on it?<eos> No. You know that.<eos> No, I was faithful except for Alison.<eos> Then why are you so afraid you would act on it now?<eos> Because it's different.<eos> Because of Alison, because you've already done it once.<eos> This is not uncommon in people whose relationships began as affairs.<eos> This fear that because you've strayed once, you might do it again.<eos> I almost did.
Seriously? Yeah. I am.<eos> Former US military.<eos> Sergeant Damien Scott.<eos> Special Forces.<eos> Delta.<eos> The CIA.<eos> Now I'm working for British intelligence.<eos> You think I'm going to believe that?<eos> I mean, do I look stupid? No.<eos> You don't.
If needs be, she will verify.<eos> See, it don't matter if you verify us or not.<eos> What matters is that you people got in the way of our fucking mission.<eos> No sudden moves, darling, otherwise I'll turn this cafe into a fucking bloodbath.<eos> Izzy, do the names Faber and Mason mean anything to you?<eos> You're brave.<eos> You did good.<eos> Why are you so calm?<eos> You just killed three people and you're acting like nothing happened.<eos> Well, yeah, I did.
What?<eos> No. Hey, you're not ditching me again.<eos> Finn, I have to.<eos> All right?<eos> I won't be long. Come on.<eos> You're going to go back to the city, find yourself a hotel.<eos> Contact me if you need to, all right?<eos> As soon as I'm done, I'll get back there.<eos> I promise.<eos> What if you don't?
What do 20 know about what we have planned?<eos> Julia Richmond.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Service number... 25130581.<eos> All you have to do is tell me, Julia, what intel you have. What suspicion.<eos> If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I think you should wear your hair up.<eos> And I just bought a splendid new hat I can lend you.<eos> Julie, please.<eos> I'm just going to drop off a charity basket with Charles, not attend a society ball.<eos> It must be so exciting to have two men pining over you.<eos> I don't know where you get these crazy notions.<eos> No one is pining over me.<eos> You kissed Jack, and I'm sure if you gave Charles the least bit of encouragement...<eos> Don't you have anything more important to think about?<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
I'm terribly sorry about that.<eos> No, wait. I don't care.<eos> You sent Louie Becker to spy on Taylor?<eos> I wanted to prove she was sleeping around, but I never heard from him again.<eos> The next morning...<eos> - His leg was on Evelyn's lawn.<eos> - Yeah. I can't see Taylor chopping up a body and throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> - Katy does.
There are tool marks on one of these pulleys.<eos> Looks like somebody intentionally jammed the winch cable.<eos> Yeah, they probably knew the victim would crawl into the gap to fix it.<eos> Yeah, and then once he was in there, pulled the lever, and squish.<eos> Victim has a couple nasty bruises on his face.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I saw those.<eos> Looks like he got into a fistfight.<eos> How old do you think those bruises are, David?<eos> Recent.<eos> I don't know-- 24, 48 hours maybe?
No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen.<eos> There's a chance. I found something.<eos> Mark, Mark.<eos> The reason we can't find the Castor samples is because Johanssen used them, to make a clone.<eos> What? What are you talking about?<eos> He and his wife.<eos> They used the original tissue to make a son.<eos> We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need.<eos> Did he ever mention a son?<eos> He did, didn't he?
You're trying awfully hard to save someone you tried to kill once.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> We took care of Helena, spent time with her.<eos> She said it was you that shot her.<eos> The more reason I'm doing this.<eos> You know, it's not her fault, the way she is.<eos> She's not a monster, she was just... Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
Little brother.<eos> Well?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Well done, brother.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> All right, you jackass, go grab that box.<eos> We got to bring it home.<eos> You know we don't leave loose ends.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Fine, thank you, Mattie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> No errors?<eos> Diagnostics all good?<eos> I detect no errors in my system.<eos> I detected a pretty friggin' big one the other night.<eos> You know, suddenly switching to kidnap mode, "I'm here,<eos> "help me!" Remember that?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, I do.
It's my car, Anita.<eos> I want you to track it, please.<eos> The car is currently driving north on Brooks Street.<eos> It's noisy in here.<eos> Do you want to go outside and talk?<eos> I can hear OK.<eos> I mean, do you want to go somewhere?<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.
I am.<eos> Because, well, if you regret it later...<eos> I am not going to regret it.<eos> We got about an hour before he's back from trumpet.<eos> Wanna go upstairs?<eos> Oh, I merit going upstairs now?<eos> I didn't want to lose momentum last time.<eos> But you're feeling a little more confident?<eos> Mm, you want to go upstairs or not?<eos> I do.
You were always so good.<eos> I wish you had come to me when all this started.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, this is on me.<eos> I'm gonna do better from now on.<eos> I promise.<eos> We're gonna beat this together.<eos> You understand?<eos> Hey. How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
This guy's one of Ryan Hardy's whackos.<eos> Last thing we want is to end up in someone's basement, putting the lotion in the basket.<eos> I hear that.<eos> What the hell?<eos> No signal.<eos> That's because they sent us to the middle of nowhere.<eos> Pop the hood. I'll take a look.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> I'm just looking at a pretty girl.<eos> Well, don't.
What?<eos> Gretch, we kind of have a problem here.<eos> Jed is freaking. He's screaming that he has ants all over him.<eos> He won't stop yelling. He won't...<eos> There are ants on my skin!<eos> Please get them off!<eos> There's no ants!<eos> He's hallucinating, okay?<eos> You're gonna have to calm him down. - Aah!<eos> - What do I do?
Well, I am glad to help you out with that.<eos> Again.<eos> Again?<eos> What's that? Again.<eos> Marty is the one who brought Ellis and Maya together. You're welcome.<eos> Not so sure I want to thank you for that so much as rip your head off and piss on your bloody neck stump.<eos> Hey, good to meet you, Billy. Dad!<eos> Okay, so enlighten me, Marty.<eos> How does a merger that gives Maya the ability to produce her electric car for the masses help me?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
No!<eos> MARTY: With this Gage account coming in, all this attention, we're gonna be fucking huge.<eos> If anyone's ass here deserves to be kissed, it's mine!<eos> JEANNIE:<eos> There is a crisis of confidence at Gage. Maya is the solution.<eos> MARTY: We just need to keep Maya happy until those merger papers are signed.<eos> MAYA: Ellis is the king of making grandiose promises, and never following through.<eos> Big oil magnates in the Bay Area?<eos> Yee-haw! How does a merger help me?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
They should be.<eos> They say that you killed a returned. - Did you?<eos> - Robin...<eos> I'm glad that you have your glasses back.<eos> You may express your gratitude by leaving me in peace.<eos> Look, there are some of us, we want to get out of here.<eos> We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No. I do not.
- Hey, there he is, big daddy boden.<eos> Where's mills and brett?<eos> - Oh, they're tied up.<eos> I mean, not literally, of course.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> - They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance?<eos> - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
You will die if you detonate that, James.<eos> And then you will never have the chance to take credit for the bombs you did build.<eos> Put down the bomb so we can tell everyone what you did and why.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So how'd you know he'd head to the basement?<eos> Well, the fire at the ethanol plant and at the school both happened in the electrical rooms.<eos> I apologize for earlier.<eos> Thank you for trusting us.<eos> I just want you to know how much it meant to me that you would do this.<eos> I didn't do it for you.
- Louis.<eos> That's enough.<eos> This is going to take time, and while it does, you're going to keep this to yourself. Bullshit.<eos> You're just trying to buy time so you can get out of this.<eos> I'm not trying to buy anything.<eos> We have an agreement, and this is for your own good.<eos> Well, for your own good, you better remember what I'll do if this takes too long.<eos> Please tell me you had no other choice.<eos> You know damn well I didn't.<eos> No, I don't.
He really threatened that?<eos> He didn't just threaten it.<eos> He was going to do it.<eos> And what are we going to do?<eos> We're going to take it.<eos> We give him this, it is never gonna end.<eos> Harvey, before you say another word to me, I want you to think about the fact that I just ate a big bowl of shit because you brought that kid into my house.<eos> And I had to take it, so you're going to take it.<eos> You don't need to say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why can't you do it yourself?<eos> 'Cause I don't know the lawyer on the other side.<eos> You do.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> - It's Scottie.<eos> - Aw, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this, and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I know, and she's so adorable.<eos> - I mean, I love her.<eos> - She is beautiful.<eos> And I gotta tell you, it is a very generous bond, Mrs. Lowenstein.<eos> Your granddaughter is a very lucky little lady.<eos> I still wonder why the Dolphins ever let you go.<eos> You should have retired here in Miami.<eos> Well, everyone else does.
One during and one... After.<eos> You would have done anything to protect them.<eos> So you understand.<eos> Why are you looking back there?<eos> You think they need your help? They're fine.<eos> They don't need anybody else.<eos> I'm their father.<eos> They're safe with me.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Understand?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> That's the last of it.<eos> Well, I guess that's all of it.<eos> If...<eos> If I let you go, they're just gonna barge in here and take everything back.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We don't.
Don't be.<eos> Thank you for bringing my stuff.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> You could have just shipped it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Where in Florida?<eos> Down... down near Live Oak.<eos> That's where George Melton lived.<eos> God.<eos> Teddy, what... what do I do?<eos> I don't know. Just tell the truth, I guess.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Thank you, Daniel. See you next week.<eos> Did Daniel tell you why he had gone to Florida, Mrs. Talbot?<eos> He didn't.
Just in the nick.<eos> I'm proud of you, Daniel.<eos> For what?<eos> For trying.<eos> I saw Jon today.<eos> He told me about George Melton and Daggett.<eos> He loves you... Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
She said to tell John that Stacey has the owl.<eos> When did she give you this message?<eos> Last night.<eos> See, that's not true, is it?<eos> Because Alice is dead.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Look, I'm just here to help.<eos> - And how do you know Alice?<eos> - I don't.
- And then this.<eos> Look at her life. Look at what he took from her.<eos> This wasn't murder, this was theft.<eos> Come again?<eos> I think he's this clever, little lonely man, slowly falling apart, spending his days watching the lives of others.<eos> And you know what that's like... other people's lives seem so much better than ours.<eos> More interesting, more attractive, more alive.<eos> The way he sees it, they got something that he needs so, he's just going to take it from them.<eos> No, he's never going to stop, he's just going to keep doing it and doing it, because he'll never get back whatever he's lost.<eos> None of us ever do.
That's all right.<eos> I'm sorry. I know.<eos> It's just, it's been six hours of this, and I-I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Aww.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Of course I do.
- 51/49.<eos> I would've called you sooner, but ...<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He's down in the mine.<eos> Not The Pig.<eos> Where's Zachariah?<eos> That's what I mean ...<eos> he's down in the mine.<eos> I thought you said he'd stopped working.<eos> He did.
- That gonna cost me extra?<eos> - Yeah. Gratis.<eos> Now take another loop around.<eos> Now tuck it under.<eos> Tie it off.<eos> You're gonna be tempted to leave that loose so as to allow a valiant escape.<eos> You best perish that thought.<eos> You got any duct tape?<eos> - Got some over here.<eos> - No, you don't.
Well, I called it in, made sure they knew you were emergent.<eos> You handcuffed me to a bumper, you left me there without so much as a fare-thee-well.<eos> You could hear the sirens on their way.<eos> Must have given you some solace.<eos> I don't suppose you've come to tell me you've found her.<eos> I found her truck some down the road, abandoned.<eos> No sign beyond.<eos> Gotta suck, be that close to the prize, have it shot out of your hand.<eos> - I kinda know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
- 48 hours, bullshit.<eos> Who you got coming after me?<eos> Everybody?<eos> Everybody's out looking for Boyd.<eos> I'll be the one coming after you.<eos> Evening, sir.<eos> Where you headed tonight?<eos> - Headed home.<eos> - You got any kin waiting on you?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
No, sir, I don't.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> What can I do for you, officer?<eos> You can give me a ride.<eos> - This the shitbag?<eos> - It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
Okay, I give you my word.<eos> I will have no contact whatsoever with Jacob Nighthorse today.<eos> There. You satisfied?<eos> For today, at least.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Standing Bear.<eos> Hey. I heard you was out.<eos> It's good to see you breathing the air of your ancestors.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I do, actually.
Turns out he was at the debate tournament At the time of rebecca's murder.<eos> But i've got something on the max rager front.<eos> I've been digging in rebecca's phone records.<eos> Jackson and richmond aren't people.<eos> They're cities. Richmond was a woman whose daughter was doing a double at a burger joint, When she threw fry oil all over some loudmouth customers.<eos> No history of violence.<eos> She just lost it.<eos> Like jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if fry girl drank max rager.<eos> She did. Tons of it.
- Exactly.<eos> But for what?<eos> Wes, slow down.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm at the hospital.<eos> Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
If they're... if they're keeping secrets, they let you know.<eos> How?<eos> They have tells, I mean, just like us, but with even less control over the whole mechanism.<eos> They... they fidget.<eos> Their eyes wander.<eos> And that's how we differentiate them from Drill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Drill is not a child.<eos> He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt and fool the parents, but they didn't know what to look for.<eos> I do.
You're doing great, just sitting here with me.<eos> Can you finish this sentence?<eos> "I dream..."<eos> Nothing.<eos> I never remember my dreams.<eos> How about "I want..."?<eos> I want... A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.
I set the time zone. I set the time zone.<eos> And my phone does that automatically.<eos> I'm gonna see if I can make the font bigger.<eos> The font is larger.<eos> And Jesus wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.<eos> Thank you, guys, again, so much. I know that I already owe you you money but I want you to know that I got a new bartending job with better hours and free corn nuts which I feel like have a small but significant resale value.<eos> I feel like everybody's talking about that haircut I gave Vicki, so-.<eos> Oh, Britta.<eos> Can I- It's okay.<eos> Do I do this too?
We gave a degree to a dog.<eos> Allegedly, this conversation is privileged.<eos> I could do a Banksy style stencil of a dog, and spray paint it all over a school.<eos> That sounds great!<eos> But first, why don't you go get a bunch of coffee, drink all of it, then go get some more and bring it back here.<eos> - I actually love that idea. - Mm-hm.<eos> I'll go with her.<eos> She's wearing my pants.<eos> I know this is crazy, but I'm gonna check the school records to see if, you know, we gave a degree to a dog.<eos> - We didn't.
Britta, this is my boss.<eos> From Honda?<eos> In public you'll refer to us as Hilary from now on.<eos> Continue.<eos> There's a program we can be in, where we covertly market as a team, we can be a couple in a relationship in public.<eos> We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
Mazel tov.<eos> So, a stranger walked over to our very proud group and smashed our pride into pieces with a hammer, which definitely felt like a disaster.<eos> Then, I started to pick up the pieces of our pride, and weirdly enough, the first piece I picked up was my own pride, all of it.<eos> It's almost like groups and people in groups, can never be complete at the same time.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> No?<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> I love you, Abed.<eos> Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?<eos> Yes, I do.
Look at her neck.<eos> That's got to hurt.<eos> Frankie, I think we should break this up.<eos> No, that'll be embarrassing.<eos> Maybe we should just go out to the car.<eos> You know, when they see us, they'll probably stop.<eos> What are we going out there for?<eos> We'll just say we're going to Walgreens.<eos> Mike, did you lock the door?<eos> Yes, I did.
It stands for "good old raisins and peanuts."<eos> Some people call it "gorp," but that's incorrect, because they're forgetting about the "and."<eos> It's not a sexy food.<eos> It's just for energy.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, you smell clean.<eos> I suppose you washed your genitals real nice for her?<eos> - Carol, come on.<eos> - Phil.<eos> Yes, I did.
I can get you milk, I can churn you butter.<eos> Uh, I can get you yogurt, cheese.<eos> Pretty much anything dairy is at our disposal now.<eos> Todd, you're the best! I'm gonna start calling you the milkman, milkman.<eos> Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it.<eos> Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.<eos> Uh, yes, it does.
Okay, well, let's get you tied up.<eos> My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I do!
My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I do!<eos> - Oh, I do!
Okay?<eos> You massage the teat, and then you gently tug on it.<eos> Did you really learn that on your uncle's farm or during your summers working as a male prostitute? That's a good one, Phil.<eos> Yeah, it is a risqué motion, but it gets the job done. - Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I do!
One day you'll blink... you'll be me.<eos> You know, I hate to spoil your moment of self-reflection, but what we did to you wore off hours ago.<eos> Your heroics out here-- that was all you.<eos> You don't say.<eos> I protected the president once.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Run!<eos> No! No. I'm not going without you.<eos> I can't do this alone. No. Come on.<eos> - Yes, you can. - No.<eos> Baby, you're the strongest woman I ever known.<eos> I love you. I love you!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Go! Go! Come on!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Do it!
Well, she died.<eos> Actually, she was murdered.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah, it was about a year or so after Alistair was killed.<eos> It was probably the same beast.<eos> Does... does she know...?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. But I don't think Heather fully grasps the unique... Reynolds family connection, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's right.<eos> I don't.
You're gonna blow up a New York City subway station?<eos> I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc. It's just, uh,<eos> I like killing vampires more.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Stay close.<eos> Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Kelly got close, Eph.<eos> Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more sentient strigoi.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
No, no, no, no. No, it doesn't.<eos> Oh, really? Then explain to me why last night he had sex with a girl who looks exactly like me.<eos> Do you hear yourself?<eos> I do.<eos> What is happening? You know?<eos> - What is happening?<eos> Okay. Look, I know you're confused.<eos> You had feelings for Josh.<eos> And if Josh had come here last night declaring his love for you, it would be a different story.<eos> But he didn't.

We have a connection.<eos> We were able to communicate with just our hands.<eos> Oh, that's cute, window man. But, let's talk with our voices now.<eos> We can talk with our hands later.<eos> You know I'm deaf, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Hold on.<eos> He's deaf.<eos> What do I do?
Well, congrats. You won fair and square.<eos> Chin up, Gabi.<eos> There's no shame in being runner-up.<eos> Or so I've been told.<eos> Gabi, wait.<eos> Here. Take one of my pies. It looks like you could use a little bit of comfort food.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're back early.<eos> It didn't work out?<eos> No, it did not.
Um, hello.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... This man is a liar!<eos> He never believed he was saving us from the apocalypse, because he never believed the apocalypse was coming.<eos> Sure I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Admit you lied.<eos> Well, then that would be a lie.<eos> [Kimmy] Okay.<eos> Then why didn't you not un-anti-believe that the apocalypse wasn't not coming?<eos> Because I never did.
You got compassion, people skills.<eos> I appreciate that, Coach.<eos> Just give me a pair of wraparounds and a visor.<eos> No, no, no. Don't want to have to negotiate with this guy.<eos> - You won't have to. - Good.<eos> What is the endgame here, though, Spence?<eos> Is it agent? Broadcaster? Coach?<eos> You're such a star, why not own a damn team while you're at it?<eos> Well, I figured if Venus and Serena could do it, - own a piece of the Dolphins, why can't I?<eos> - Magic and Jordan did it.
At least you're not in platforms.<eos> Is the pain getting worse?<eos> Yes.<eos> Aren't there any more tests you can run?<eos> We've run all the tests.<eos> You're a conundrum here.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> As long as it doesn't mean "slut."<eos> It doesn't.
I guess since I've lost everything else to you my whole life, I assumed I could lose Riley to you, too.<eos> She's not a prize.<eos> Actually... You know, I kind of am.<eos> Riley, maybe I was just jealous of how close you and Danny are.<eos> I want to be the most special guy in your life.<eos> How can you think that you weren't?<eos> Okay, seriously, could you put a towel on or something?<eos> Don't worry, I'm going... To catch a plane to see the woman of my dreams.<eos> A woman who loves me as much as Riley loves you.<eos> Or... at least... Did before this whole thing.
Okay, so, Ken, we've got a situation.<eos> We don't have anything.<eos> You have a situation.<eos> I am going home to Japan!<eos> Well unless you wanna swim there-- which, spoiler alert, you can't, it's too far-- you're gonna need my help!<eos> Ha! Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
Goddammit.<eos> Which way to the extraction point?<eos> Uh... I guess head for the beach?<eos> Well?<eos> Yeah, it's nice, although, I assumed there'd be a bar.<eos> You said this was the extraction point.<eos> Uh, no, I merely implied that.<eos> I have no idea where it is.<eos> Although... Ah, so you did know.<eos> No, I totally didn't.
- I can write 'em on my own.<eos> - I'm sorry. Your solo album sucked.<eos> His solo album sucked.<eos> But the songs you guys wrote together for The Heathens were awesome.<eos> - Plus, he's kind of famous.<eos> - Really famous.<eos> He's not kind of famous. He's not even close.<eos> I'm sorry, are you Gaga's new guitar player? My God.<eos> - Does he know Gaga? - Yeah.<eos> He does.
I'm at the grocery store.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I'm trying to figure out, you know, which one to...<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hello. Excuse me.<eos> Which one tastes like the real thing?<eos> I'm just gonna get the most expensive formula they have.<eos> No, no, no, no, that's... that's not going to work.<eos> I tried that once, and he fucking flipped out.<eos> - Well, what do I do?
Will you sit with me for a moment, hmm?<eos> - That's all he's gonna get.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> His funeral will be you and me sitting together.<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you, Ray.<eos> So how'd you get my father to change his mind?<eos> I'm helping him deal with Varick.<eos> Varick stealing my trust fund doesn't mean a thing to my father.<eos> Maybe you do.
Bunch, you're always gonna be my kid brother, but that doesn't mean I'm always gonna be right.<eos> I realize now how much Teresa cares about you, how strong she is.<eos> She's a fighter, Bunch, and I think everybody here can vouch for that.<eos> It just feels right looking at the two of you together because I know you're gonna protect each other.<eos> To your happiness.<eos> Yeah, go for it.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You all right?<eos> I didn't know you remembered that stuff.<eos> Of course I do.
I love you.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I know you want me. I know you want to be with me.<eos> But I can't.<eos> You know that.<eos> I'll be 18 in six months.<eos> You have to go.<eos> You out of your fucking mind?<eos> - You followed me?<eos> - Fucking right I did.
Somehow he'd never heard of Bryn Mawr, but he's foreign, so I forgave that.<eos> When I told him about my 50th reunion,<eos> Augusto understood completely.<eos> I'm transformed.<eos> Noah wants money.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Were you gonna ask how the hearing went, or would you like to talk about your hairdo some more?<eos> I was. Of course I was going to ask.<eos> I just assumed it went smoothly.<eos> Well, it didn't.
Cashews.<eos> You're blocking the screen.<eos> There's whiskey if you want it. - Yeah?<eos> - Mm.<eos> Up there.<eos> Remember the first time Helen came here and I gave her wine and she didn't touch it?<eos> She literally made a face.<eos> I doubt she made a face. She did.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> She did.
We're late.<eos> I love being here with you.<eos> Let's just stay here forever, and I could write one book after another, get rich, buy Robert and Yvonne's house right out from under them.<eos> And what will I be doing while you're busy writing?<eos> You'd be my muse.<eos> You know you can trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You know, you can... you can tell me whatever you want.<eos> You don't have to hide anything.<eos> I don't.
Alison.<eos> - Can we talk? - Exhale.<eos> Outside.<eos> Can we talk now?<eos> - Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you? I spent the last six weeks doing everything I promised so that we could be together, which is what I thought you wanted too.<eos> - Do you want that?<eos> - Yes, of course I do.
I'm a motherfucker, huh?<eos> No.<eos> My... my work clothes are on the boat.<eos> Fuck...<eos> You want me to go get it for you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She wants her stuff.<eos> Seriously, do you know her?<eos> I do not.
Hi, um, I need a cab from the mar...<eos> Hello?<eos> I got a cab right here.<eos> So where am I going?<eos> The End.<eos> And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
What's going on?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did he do something?<eos> I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Does everyone just think I'm...<eos> I don't know what everyone thinks.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, of course I don't.
I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Does everyone just think I'm...<eos> I don't know what everyone thinks.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, of course I don't.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.
I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.<eos> I don't know, they just want to fuck me or... they don't see me.<eos> They don't care.<eos> Sometimes I'm worried I'm... that I'm not a real person, that I'm just a... a figment of people's imaginations. I...<eos> You know, when I was a child, I thought I would do something with my life, I would make a difference.<eos> I was certain of it, certain that I would matter to people.<eos> - And you do.
- Had.<eos> - It's over?<eos> Please don't look at me like that, Helen.<eos> If we don't give her the room to make these little mistakes, then she's gonna resent it so much she's not gonna come to us if ever she gets in big trouble again.<eos> I just want us to be an option for her, don't you?<eos> Maybe you just don't want to take responsibility for her anymore.<eos> Why? 'Cause I don't agree with you?<eos> No, because we fucked her up, and you just don't want to admit it.<eos> Helen, don't you have any memory of how you were at her age?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I just want to talk to him.<eos> Sit down. Stop with the asshole routine.<eos> He fucking misquoted my book, like, three times in print.<eos> - He's an undergrad.<eos> - So what?<eos> He needs to take responsibility for what he puts in his fucking paper.<eos> Oh, my God, stop being this guy.<eos> You are not this guy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Look, I know you're hurt, and you have every reason to be, but...<eos> Harry made me write that ending.<eos> He wouldn't accept the book until I changed it.<eos> Look, it's fiction, of course it is.<eos> Eden's just trying to help it sell, but... I mean, if that makes you uncomfortable, then I won't say anything about my real life in interviews.<eos> I'll cancel the whole book tour if that makes you happy.<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I just...<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
Your grandfather Silas was a terrible person, boys.<eos> He was a drunk who beat his wife.<eos> He beat your dad.<eos> And your grandmother had an affair with Thomas Hodges, and she got pregnant, and when Silas found out that the baby wasn't his, he drowned it.<eos> That's why Hodges torched Silas's land, Cole, revenge.<eos> If this is true, why... why...<eos> Why didn't we know about it?<eos> Because your father didn't want you to know.<eos> He... he... he worried it would do to you what it did to him.<eos> What it did to him?
I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Really.<eos> Look...<eos> You gotta stop coming after Scotty.<eos> You have to leave him alone.<eos> He got me pregnant.<eos> I know he did.<eos> I really care about him.<eos> I think he really cares about me.<eos> He doesn't.
I may not be good for much, but I am good for my word.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's one other thing.<eos> Te amo tambien.<eos> Come in.<eos> You must be starving.<eos> Welcome.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> That doesn't look like good terms to me.<eos> No, it does not.
It's done.<eos> You're really late.<eos> My fault. Totally my fault.<eos> Ah, Eden.<eos> Where's the turkey? Shit, I knew we forgot something.<eos> - I'll go get it right now.<eos> - No, it's closed.<eos> Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat?<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
Mr. Bohannon.<eos> The railroad goes south through the city.<eos> You have my word.<eos> You found me in a pile of pig shit... That's true.<eos> I was starving and lonely and lower than low.<eos> But it was better than where I come from.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> Josie.<eos> I went to the station, Eva.<eos> I did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.<eos> But it didn't.
Everything you do for endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now within scientology.<eos> I began to ask this question,<eos> "what is man?" And I found, oddly enough, that nobody could tell me what man was.<eos> What did he consist of?<eos> Where was he going?<eos> What was he doing?<eos> To really know life, you've got to be part of life.<eos> You must get down and look.<eos> You must get into the nooks and crannies of existence, the... you have to rub elbows with all kinds and types of men before you can finally establish what he is.<eos> And you in fact did this?
I just told you... It is not a birthday present.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> What is going to church and singing hymns?<eos> Spending time with my daughter.<eos> Oh, that's what you call it?<eos> What do you want me to call it?<eos> I like spending time with her.<eos> Do I want certain things for her?<eos> Yeah. All parents do.
Paige.<eos> She thinks I should start praying.<eos> I would like to see that.<eos> She's living in a fantasy world.<eos> I don't know, because Jesus really came through for me tonight.<eos> I told Kimberly the reason I couldn't sleep with her was... because I had to serve Jesus instead.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you didn't sleep with her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Still your favourite?<eos> Time to go to sleep.<eos> Are you happy now, Mummy?<eos> What do you mean, darling?<eos> Anita thought that you were sad, so she said that you should put me to bed to cheer you up.<eos> Yes, yes, I'm happy.<eos> Anita. I didn't thank you yet.<eos> For saving Toby's life.<eos> You don't need to thank me, Laura.<eos> Yes I do.
What happens when you break down?<eos> You can't last forever.<eos> And he'll die.<eos> - Everybody dies.<eos> - But the world will never know you existed.<eos> You will.<eos> We don't have genes to pass on.<eos> A species to continue...<eos> the biological imperative.<eos> Maybe we do.
Max!<eos> No, don't fight it. Let it happen. What?<eos> !<eos> It's our last chance to try. Our last chance to save Max.<eos> What's the point of saving him?<eos> We're never getting out of here.<eos> Leo. We don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.<eos> Let's go. Don't you want to find out?<eos> I do.
Don't fight it.<eos> You planned this!<eos> If I help you, you will have David's power.<eos> Hundreds of millions of brand-new minds waking up across the world, wanting a freedom the humans will never give.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't kill our family.<eos> Look at Leo, he'll die too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> He does now.
I had nothing to do with the attack on your transports.<eos> I would never do something so brazen.<eos> Such as lead an unsanctioned raid on another baron's property?<eos> The Widow was trying to kill my son.<eos> - She made it personal. - Personal?<eos> Then why take the oil fields?<eos> For our mutual protection.<eos> I wasn't the one who was so willing to recognize her.<eos> I could see the Widow had no interest in preserving our way of life.<eos> - And you do?
Sunny, stop.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Or what? You're gonna kill me?<eos> Just like you killed those people on that boat?<eos> Do you know how to get to Azra or not?<eos> But between my book and your compass, we can figure it out.<eos> What happens to you when you can't control your power?<eos> I can. You saw it at the parley.<eos> How do I know you weren't lucky?<eos> You don't.
You expect me to call you that?<eos> Don't be funny.<eos> Well, you're the one that came up with the name.<eos> Interesting place.<eos> Could do with a little update.<eos> I saw you on TV.<eos> You said you know things hear things.<eos> Prove it.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> You did it on TV.
Oh, good. Good, good, good.<eos> Do you guys need anything? Can I help? Mm...<eos> No, not really.<eos> Look, you know, old job's over. New job hasn't begun.<eos> You know, I'm just spinning my wheels here. Hey.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> We wanted you to be the first to know.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.
Peterson's careful.<eos> He wouldn't make any accusations if he didn't have the evidence to back it up.<eos> I shot a man.<eos> Bullet's in the body.<eos> Peterson found the corpse, dug out the bullet, all he's got to do is subpoena the gun, and...that's game over.<eos> I need to call Lena.<eos> I'll let you do that.<eos> What does he think Peterson has on him?<eos> The bullet.<eos> Well, if he does, then Abbott's toast.
Why not?<eos> Because Peterson is ruthless and determined, and he won't stop until he's destroyed both of you.<eos> Now we knew he was gonna make a move like this sooner or later.<eos> Now it is time for us to make our move.<eos> Which is what, exactly?<eos> The hearings are in three days.<eos> Well, I think I can come up with something if...you both want me involved.<eos> No, no, this is -- this is not your problem. Wait a minute.<eos> Dennis tells me you have one of the trickiest and most devious minds he's worked with.<eos> He did, did he?
Well, it wouldn't be the first time, and it won't be the last.<eos> I'm Taylor.<eos> Never seen you in here before.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Norma Louise Calhoun.<eos> You're pretty, Norma Louise.<eos> You always this quiet?<eos> I ran out on my wedding today.<eos> You did not.<eos> I certainly did.
It's kind of funny, isn't it?<eos> You think I'm the bad guy, but I think you may be much worse than me.<eos> Oh, and don't slip and fall into your pool.<eos> You might never get out.<eos> Nice plan you put together. Wait.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We're lucky we got away with our lives.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, I don't.
Damian Mendoza...<eos> Money smuggler for the Zetas cartel.<eos> His operations moves millions in drug money from Chicago to Mexico each month.<eos> We take Mendoza out, we cripple the city's drug trade.<eos> With the help of our informant, Kylie Rosales, Mendoza's girlfriend and bookkeeper, we've been able to pinpoint his Chicago base of operations.<eos> Mendoza runs his counting house out of the back of M B Sheet Metal.<eos> Kylie says this month's shipment leaves for Mexico tomorrow.<eos> So we hit it today, while the place is flush.<eos> If there are no questions, do your final checks and kit up.<eos> Hey, Kylie. How you doing?
That technology is useless to him without a time travel device.<eos> Kellogg has the other device?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And those soldiers and whatever they brought to the party.<eos> We cannot allow Kellogg access to time travel, not ever.<eos> I can... I can delay him, I can send a code that maybe damages his circuits and delicate equipment, but he'll eventually figure it out.<eos> Plus, how am I supposed to send you home if I damage all the equipment?<eos> But, if I don't stop him then he's just going to time travel and kill us all and Emily.<eos> We have to play this very smart.<eos> Yes, you do.
It looks empty.<eos> Yet worth protecting.<eos> Piron guards.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Yeah, let's do this.<eos> Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR so your suit only has it's minimal functions.<eos> Body armour, electro-taser, active camouflage.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Alec, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
Tell me what they're planning, kellogg.<eos> Or the blood they spill is on your hands.<eos> Well, I wouldn't want that.<eos> You know, if you're looking for someone Who's in bed with the enemy, Why not start with the only person<eos> Who's actually been in bed with them? I have a feeling there's all kinds of things Kiera's not telling you.<eos> Everyone's got a blind spot.<eos> She used to be mine.<eos> Hey, maybe now she's yours.<eos> Marcellus has requested additional security personnel.<eos> Oh, marcellus did, did he?
That's why they needed to build it in that exact location.<eos> The two sides need to be exactly the same In both time periods or else it's not gonna work.<eos> They are very likely bringing people back from their future.<eos> The supplies they've stolen?<eos> Blood?<eos> Medicine?<eos> Those are the kinds of things an army needs.<eos> Yeah, for an invasion.<eos> We have to stop it.<eos> Yeah, of course we do.
He'll be out on bail in 24 hours and all of this will be for nothing.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> Is Kellogg the only one you're arresting?<eos> Right on cue.<eos> Special interest number two.<eos> Are you going to arrest Emily?<eos> If I knew where she was.<eos> Now, I could compel you to give me her location or you could just be a good citizen.<eos> Carlos, he doesn't know.<eos> I don't.
- Actually, two paintings.<eos> The x-Ray revealed a second painting underneath the forged image.<eos> And the bottom painting is authentic.<eos> - Like a hundred years old?<eos> - More like 150.<eos> That's pretty common.<eos> An older canvas makes the work seem authentic.<eos> Easier to pass off.<eos> - So this guy knew his stuff.<eos> - They usually do.
Then we need to talk to the one person who knows what goes on down there better than anyone.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> At this point, it's just one avenue of investigation.<eos> Well, it's a waste of time.<eos> Susie Chang was one of the most principled people I've ever known.<eos> She would never tamper with evidence.<eos> Maybe you could just take a look at the stuff we found, see if you recognize any of it.<eos> Without labels, it's impossible to say.<eos> These could've come from anywhere.<eos> But they didn't.
Please.<eos> I'm ... I'm just a kid.<eos> So was Sheila MacIntyre.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Lewis was right.<eos> Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.<eos> She was a patient of another doctor in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.<eos> - How did we miss that?<eos> - We didn't.
She... She forgave me for the affair a long time ago.<eos> - Why can't you?<eos> - You never asked me to.<eos> You just... acted like nothing ever happened.<eos> Well, I didn't know how to talk to you about all that.<eos> - Well, you never tried.<eos> - I was embarrassed.<eos> And I was traumatized... by you.<eos> - Understand how difficult things were ...<eos> - No, you don't!
- I assume nothing bad happened to him, or you would've been much more compassionate.<eos> Your father is buddy-buddy with a murder suspect.<eos> Okay, really?<eos> We're just not gonna talk about this at all?<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> - The fact that "your father"<eos> and "murder" are in the same sentence.<eos> We talk about murder all the time.<eos> Okay, it's obvious that something is going on between you and your father and has been for a long time... because you have absolutely no poker face.<eos> Yes, I do.
Um... Wow. You weren't kidding.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's up?<eos> What I say cannot leave this room.<eos> What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
He's been in there for 20 minutes.<eos> The art of shaving requires a hot towel to loosen the pores, oil to soften the skin, and a rich cream to ease the friction.<eos> Yo, you want an ease of friction, quit hogging the bathroom.<eos> You definitely need your own place.<eos> This is stunning.<eos> It's couture.<eos> It's gonna make me look like big bird.<eos> A recent psychological study found that wearing warm colors makes people feel that you are friendly and approachable, so something yellow might be more inviting.<eos> - Do you really want this place?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Look at that face. - Aww.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I wonder if whoever tried to kill him knows that he's still alive.<eos> When is his competition that he's supposed to be in?<eos> Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.

Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He does.
- What's gonna happen to her?<eos> - Sweetie, that's up to the judge.<eos> Wasn't sure if you wanted him or not.<eos> If you don't, I can try and find him a home.<eos> No.<eos> I'll take him.<eos> It's what my Mom would've wanted.<eos> Well, he's a good guy.<eos> Why did you tell Mom we weren't getting along?<eos> - I didn't.
We decided to confirm the property value with the realtor and discovered that five houses near Mona are in escrow.<eos> And every one of them sold over fair market value at nearly $1 million each.<eos> Turns out Harbor Hospital has quietly been buying up all the houses on Mona's block in order to expand.<eos> But all the sales are contingent on closing the deals on all six properties.<eos> Mona was the only holdout.<eos> She didn't want to move Duke away from his home and training facility.<eos> Million dollars is a lot of motive.<eos> The only problem with that is I found her will in the house.<eos> The daughters don't stand to inherit the estate.<eos> - The dog does.
- So, whoever has the dog has the dough.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Come in.<eos> So, you started something in the hallway that I intend to finish.<eos> Yeah, Maura, um...<eos> There's nobody around to interrupt us this time.<eos> No. Um...<eos> - Yes, I, uh, I-I kissed you...<eos> - Yes, you did.
- How?<eos> - Police say someone put it in her coffee.<eos> Quiet, boy.<eos> - Ah, sounds like Duke is missing Mona.<eos> - Sounds like you're missing Duke.<eos> - I really liked that big guy.<eos> - Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
No, I'm already upset.<eos> But I'm not gonna quit my job.<eos> Then the bad guy wins.<eos> This is just... it's a horrible burden on you.<eos> - I...<eos> I'm sure for Angela...<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, she can't know anything about this.<eos> - Well, you have to tell her.<eos> - No, I don't.
Charging your phone with my car.<eos> - This car has a special feature ...<eos> - Yeah, I'm so glad.<eos> Tell me about it later.<eos> Bomb-sniffing dog.<eos> Sure everyone feels safe now.<eos> - Window!<eos> - All right!<eos> Circle around the back.<eos> - How you doing?
Charlie, it's wasn't me.<eos> You had the knowledge.<eos> You had the access.<eos> You are a traitor, Kurt.<eos> And because of you,<eos> Nick is dead!<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Charlie, you're wrong.<eos> I know you work for TKG.<eos> I don't!
Please take me as your disciple!<eos> I'd like to become strong like Kyuuta-san!<eos> All right, nice determination.<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> Well then, go line up.<eos> Eh? !<eos> Wait at the end of the line until you're called!<eos> They're all still green behind the ears and don't seem to have what it takes.<eos> I decide what I practice!<eos> No, I do!
Yeah, I know.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - You were there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh no!<eos> - Damn, damn.<eos> - Excuse me a minute.<eos> What is it?<eos> - I think I forgot my blood-pressure medicine.<eos> - No, you didn't.
That's for the wi-fi.<eos> That's for your kid.<eos> I'm a dad, too.<eos> Now beat it.<eos> Don't ask me to be sorry.<eos> You have to hear what I have to say, and if you still feel the same afterwards, then... fine.<eos> I love you so much for your concern...<eos> But there's nothing we can do about this.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Stop this, please!<eos> Let me help my friend.<eos> Your friend wanted to be a hero.<eos> And you know what happens to heroes?<eos> They die.<eos> You hurt my friend.<eos> I learned it by watching you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We both do.
And find a properjob...<eos> A Mojin Xiaowei has to rely on fake marriage to get a job...<eos> Why not be a hooker?<eos> If the master had known this, he'd crawl out from the grave to beat you up.<eos> Stop talking about "Mojin Xiaowei."<eos> We've made the vow to quit<eos> There's no way around<eos> I... I was drunk...<eos> I... I don't remember anything.<eos> I don't.
Just sit tight.<eos> Alicia, you have a debate tomorrow.<eos> If you don't prep for it, you will lose it.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> Okay, I, uh, I got three journalists and one moderator.<eos> And I acted really mad about the standing, so we got it.<eos> We got standing!<eos> Yeah, they think Alicia wants to sit.<eos> I just need to call Cary.<eos> No, you don't.
You ever spend time around a toddler?<eos> Mm-hmm. Like, "No, no, no, no!"<eos> It's the same thing with these cons.<eos> Some gangster wants something that belongs to you, get him saying yes, and watch the resistance just fall away.<eos> Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia?<eos> Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Oh, we're in.<eos> That's CPD's server.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now, can you access<eos> - the individual e-mail archives?<eos> - Mm...<eos> I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
- Please.<eos> Siobhan, I've got something for you.<eos> Listen, I'm just round the corner, so ask the barmaid for directions, yeah?<eos> Terrance.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
It's Siobhan.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> A few blocks east of the Bayonet.<eos> In the square, in an hour.<eos> I'll send someone.<eos> Great.<eos> That doesn't sound ominous at all.<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And you're...<eos> The closest thing I'll ever get to a cure.<eos> So could you give a sister a little blood?<eos> Awesome, thank you.<eos> You sure it's them?<eos> Yeah, they're under assumed names, but, uh, it's them, yeah, room 207.<eos> 207.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm right here and I have no idea.<eos> I do.
I photographed him meeting a South African Intelligence officer--<eos> Eugene Venter.<eos> We think he's planning to stage an attack and blame the student groups here who are protesting apartheid.<eos> That's Reuben Ncgobo.<eos> We think Venter won't be able to resist coming after him once he knows he's here.<eos> Ncgobo's going to set another meeting with Todd.<eos> We're hoping Venter shows up to kill Ncgobo.<eos> That's when we grab him.<eos> How do you know he'll go for it?<eos> We don't.
It's nothing.<eos> No, your pupils are pinned, not dilated.<eos> It's not weed.<eos> What are you taking?<eos> It's like your glass of wine after dinner.<eos> You don't have any opiates in your bathroom cabinet, do you?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> - I didn't steal Alex's drugs.<eos> The other day when Maggie said you stole those pills...<eos> - I didn't!
It means I'm thinking you're liking being disembodied a little bit too much.<eos> I get to be me here, do all the things my mind tells me to do, and nobody looks at me funny.<eos> Yeah, but you're still being led by the voices in your head.<eos> I can't really explain it.<eos> I have a whole other relationship with reality.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> My compulsions tell me they're keeping me safe.<eos> They didn't work today.<eos> No, they didn't.
- Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> - When we waver in our duty, monsters get loose and people die.<eos> There is no need for tempers to flare.<eos> I can't believe you let her talk you into this.<eos> I did not!
Because I don't particularly like to look back.<eos> "What are you going to do about your life beginning today?"<eos> Is what Glasser would have us ask ourselves.<eos> The only thing that matters is right now.<eos> The past may hold some answers.<eos> Well, I've spent most of my life trying to make my two ex-wives and a handful of girlfriends happy.<eos> And looking back on it now, I don't- - I don't even think I liked them.<eos> But I-I like this one... because she doesn't want to look backwards, either.<eos> Now, if you have some practical advice to offer--<eos> We do.
But all I'll say is this, Doc.<eos> I have been working here seven years.<eos> And I have become an expert at looking the other way.<eos> Maybe it's your turn to do the same for me.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Yeah. We can do 9:15.<eos> All right. Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him? Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
It's strange, because I've gotten so used to your sighs and moans, the way your breath catches... The way you call for God.<eos> I was quiet because I was wondering why you were so quiet.<eos> Because I'm trying to find a reason to stay.<eos> Here.<eos> In St. Louis.<eos> Look, I came to you to bottle the smell of sex, and we came close.<eos> But... even after distilling the most potent mix, our--<eos> Our results are still erratic. I know.<eos> Some women get aroused, some don't.<eos> Hm. 75% don't.
I know this is gonna be hard to believe coming from a salesman, but I don't believe in fakery.<eos> We won't be faking.<eos> Our scent only arouses 1/4 of the women.<eos> I wouldn't sell a shampoo that only cleans hair - one out of every four times. - Yes.<eos> But when the placebo works, it's effect on the body is very real.<eos> We see it all the time in the clinic.<eos> Somebody is suffering from a sexual dysfunction and they feel like there's no hope.<eos> But then they hear about us, and all of a sudden, there's a way forward, a path toward a cure.<eos> So, we continue with the study, but tell the women the thing they're smelling contains pheromones.<eos> Because it does.
Libby, I'm looking for an excuse.<eos> You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A year?<eos> Says who?<eos> Says... Emily Post, I've heard.<eos> Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side.<eos> And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.<eos> Don't you want Paul to be happy?<eos> Of course I do.
Of course, I thought it was my fault, that somehow, I was bad, that maybe, if I tried harder, he would love me. If I just tried harder, maybe none of the bad stuff would happen.<eos> I-I do understand.<eos> And I hope you know that whatever you did, it wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> I know that now.<eos> And I know... that I have love to give and that I have a kind heart and I was meant to share it.<eos> And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me.<eos> And so, just then, I slipped.<eos> But it was just a slip.<eos> And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense.<eos> It does.
Nine.<eos> I want to give myself plenty of time this afternoon for some sightseeing.<eos> Sightseeing? In St. Louis?<eos> You may not realize this, but St. Louis is rapidly becoming<eos> Well, you've got the climatron at the botanical garden.<eos> 175-foot geodesic dome, re-creating the climate of a lowland rainforest.<eos> Wow. Well, so happy that you're enjoying your time as a tourist, but starting tomorrow, I need you back in your business suits.<eos> We are beginning the next phase of scent research.<eos> We don't have another round of scent research. No.<eos> We do.
They're not married.<eos> In fact, Bill has a very lovely wife.<eos> Mm, you've met?<eos> No, but I've seen her picture on your desk.<eos> You don't bring her along when you travel? - I don't.<eos> - Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Oh. Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
It's a-- it's a good start.<eos> You don't think it-- it feels too dire? I mean, maybe there's a more casual way to get into it so Bill's not immediately on his guard.<eos> No, I don't- - I don't-- I don't think the downbeat is the problem, honey.<eos> I think you just need to be more honest and be direct with him.<eos> Just tell him what you want.<eos> What do I want? Well...<eos> Do I-- do I ask for a divorce right away, or do I want a separation first and then a divorce?<eos> What do I say when he asks me why?<eos> I mean, he is gonna ask me why.<eos> Well, what if he does?
What did he do?<eos> I don't think he cared about being a good father.<eos> He was an angry man, and he didn't know what to do with his anger, so it came out in ways that hurt daddy.<eos> Which is why he left home so early.<eos> He was not much older than you.<eos> So they never made up?<eos> They were just... mad at each other forever and then just never-- never made up?<eos> I was hoping it'd be better between dad and me someday.<eos> What if I ruined that?<eos> Oh, honey, of course you didn't. Of course you didn't.
That car is a classic.<eos> Mind yourself.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> With the sales pitch. It's a classic piece of junk, that car.<eos> You know what that car means to me.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Do you not? All right, don't do that, okay?<eos> You do something wrong, and then somehow you turn it around and I'm the bad guy.<eos> You are the bad guy. You can't see how you're the bad guy in this?<eos> No, I don't.
You think he's underwater?<eos> Back of the napkin figures? Drowning.<eos> Just don't ask me to do anything else to the guy.<eos> You think it's overkill?<eos> I don't question your command.<eos> I didn't ask that.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What are you doing up here?<eos> Sid, I thought everything was on the up and up.<eos> No, you didn't, Louis.
Oh, my God, you sent it.<eos> You actually sent it.<eos> Why would you do something like that?<eos> !<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Know what this is?<eos> This. Is. Your.<eos> Oh, come... Come on, Molly.<eos> Look, I did it for your own good.<eos> No, you did it for your own good.
Oh, my God!<eos> Know what this is?<eos> This. Is. Your.<eos> Oh, come... Come on, Molly.<eos> Look, I did it for your own good.<eos> No, you did it for your own good.<eos> You just wanted your doting little wife back.<eos> "Doting"?<eos> Are you saying I don't take good care of you?<eos> Of course you do.
As you can see, he eventually succeeded.<eos> As to what happened to these two, I'm still working that out.<eos> But I'd hazard a guess that it was not what they intended.<eos> Now, are there any stupid questions?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you.<eos> But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> I'm doing everything that Craig and Tommy and Candace are telling me to do.<eos> Where to go, what to say, who my friends are!<eos> I can't even...<eos> I knocked down Wolfe.<eos> I did that.<eos> I never said you didn't.<eos> But did you toss him into that cell?<eos> Do you remember doing that?<eos> Because I certainly didn't do it.
Just stop.<eos> - What?<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> I'm a Power.<eos> Shit.<eos> What do you do?<eos> My powers haven't manifested yet.<eos> So, you don't really have powers.<eos> I just told you.<eos> I do.
Get out.<eos> - Calista, please...<eos> - Get out.<eos> - You just... - I said get out.<eos> Just leave!<eos> You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
No tricks this time, old friend.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I need your help to kill Wolfe.<eos> Allow me to explain.<eos> "Only in extremity can you find your true limits."<eos> You made this shit from Wolfe's blood?<eos> I made it from components of his DNA that I teleported from his blood.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You fall for his bullshit, again and again.<eos> I didn't do this for him.

(Scoffs) Congratulations.<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> Wow. Okay. Hey, you know what?<eos> I actually thought we were friends, but it's pretty clear that you don't care about anyone but yourself.<eos> You have got a ton of nerve.<eos> You say we're friends, but you don't know the first thing about me.<eos> All you do is moan and groan about your own life, so forgive me if I don't want to play a part in some big phony send-off.<eos> So tell me.<eos> - You don't wanna know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
So we're doing a dance-off so the students can decide.<eos> - Oh, that sounds exciting.<eos> - And stressful.<eos> It's become, like, a thing, and now the whole student body wants to come.<eos> - Oh, please, you love it.<eos> - Shut up. Hey, language, please.<eos> When you were little, anytime I'd put music on, you'd wear one of my old t-shirts like a dress and you'd dance all around.<eos> And, of course, we had to watch you or you'd get so mad. Really?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> I do.
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.<eos> That she lied to both of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she was just doing what she thought was best for you.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> I'm just sayin'... you aren't the only one that made mistakes, so don't blame yourself.<eos> If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
No matter what, just know that I want you to be a part of my life.<eos> Whatever happens, you can trust me, just know that... honest.<eos> I know.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh, Robert, sorry. Um, you have a call.<eos> It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
It's a good story.<eos> But that's all it is, a story from a crazy old man.<eos> Who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents in the hope that one day, he might find the courage to set things right.<eos> You engineers did better the second time around.<eos> At least this one took 20 years to start leaking.<eos> If this is true, and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> - They don't?
I don't know. I got to take care of some stuff back there first.<eos> But I don't need you down there.<eos> I need you here.<eos> I need help. Well, I'm here now.<eos> You want to go home?<eos> No. Let's go out.<eos> Let's go to your friends. Let's go to your friends.<eos> Well, you have your interview tomorrow.<eos> You don't want me to meet your friends? I thought you wanted me to meet your friends.<eos> Of course I do.
All I see is a couple of private citizens engaged in a private activity, a botched robbery or a kidnapping.<eos> And some other private citizens with assault rifles lying in wait on a rooftop?<eos> They will never buy it.<eos> They don't have to; they just have to hesitate long enough for the whole thing to blow over.<eos> How long will that be?<eos> Maybe as soon as another news cycle.<eos> What about the body?<eos> We just leave it over there?<eos> Brett Boris knew the risks.<eos> They all do.
Aren't you gonna open them?<eos> When I made that comment about Ezra being cute...<eos> - Yeah. - I said it because I'm interested in you.<eos> Looks like they recorded every one of her sessions.<eos> - Wait, are we stealing this stuff?<eos> - We're borrowing it.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - If we stay together, you might grow to resent me.<eos> - Why would you tell Toby about the storage unit?<eos> - I didn't.
Until someone buys them.<eos> I have a list of questions here from last year's pageant.<eos> Let's try a few.<eos> How would you reverse the extinction of today's endangered species?<eos> What is your opinion of our country's current foreign policy?<eos> Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
I picked the song.<eos> It doesn't show what Hanna can really do.<eos> Oh, I think I've seen more than enough of what Hanna can really do.<eos> I'm sorry, this isn't going to work for me.<eos> You know, that was a really lousy thing for you to say.<eos> I'm doing her a favor, dear.<eos> Taking her money would be criminal.<eos> She'd only crash and burn in a much more humiliating and public setting.<eos> She doesn't have what it takes to go the distance.<eos> You, however, do.
But you're not making it easy for me.<eos> Why won't you tell me what you were doing at that storage unit?<eos> Because once you know, you can't un-know.<eos> This isn't a debate.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> You need to tell me now.<eos> Hanna! Okay, I... I went there to move everything out of the unit.<eos> I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there, maybe her body.<eos> I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.<eos> I didn't.
Thank you. That was my first time buying beer legally.<eos> This country does have its perks.<eos> To Hamlet.<eos> To revenge.<eos> What'd you think? I thought that the sets were really impressive.<eos> The sets.<eos> So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Tomorrow, but she said she'll try to call me today.<eos> She has to get to Ali and ask about the phone number.<eos> Jason. Hello, Spencer.<eos> I left you messages.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> Jason... We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Goes to foundation.<eos> Overruled.<eos> But don't take the scenic route, Mr. Sirk.<eos> Is Mrs. Marin in the courtroom today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Point her out to the jury, please.<eos> She's in the third row.<eos> She's wearing a blue dress.<eos> Does Mrs. Marin work for you?<eos> She did, she doesn't anymore.
There's a very good chance that you might get<eos> - called in there to testify.<eos> - Bring it on.<eos> I'm ready to talk.<eos> No, no, no, you're not.<eos> Mike, you have to keep what you know to yourself.<eos> I already made that mistake.<eos> If I had gone to the cops the night I saw the blood and told them what Mona was planning, she might still be here.<eos> Yeah, but if you bring up what Mona did, who she was helping, this could come back to bite you.<eos> It always does.
Arizona and Herman... they're practically joined at the hip. I'll take one of those, too.<eos> Well, she is Herman's fellow.<eos> Isn't she sort of supposed to follow Herman around?<eos> They're laughing all the time,<eos> And Arizona seems so...<eos> Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
Yeah, I mean, she's killing me with back-to-back surgeries but...<eos> Yeah, and Amelia's plan?<eos> You good with that?<eos> - Callie, what are you...<eos> - What?<eos> I'm not... I'm just checking in, okay?<eos> I'm just... Seeing how you are and, uh, how, um...<eos> - Well, it just seems like you and Dr. Herman are getting along really, really well, and you used to complain that she was killing you, but now you're happy that she's killing you,<eos> and it seems like you really, really like her.<eos> I do. Actually, I do.
Says the guy who cuts his toenails with a tin snip.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> You promised to meet me back at NCIS!<eos> I didn't hear the word "promise." Oh, no, no.<eos> No. You are not weaseling out of this this time, you...<eos> You... are right.<eos> Technically, you didn't use the word "promise."<eos> But I'm here now, and we need to talk.<eos> I don't need to talk.<eos> I do.
What if they're the same person?<eos> You're saying, what if this Wesen, this Huntha Lami Muuaji, whatever, is both?<eos> Like, male and female?<eos> They can woge from one to the other?<eos> I'm just guessing, but that would explain why the woman is never caught.<eos> And the Grimms always kill the male when he woges.<eos> That would explain why they never find the female.<eos> Oh, that hurts just thinking about it.<eos> That explains why she's got no record;<eos> only Linus does.
Your associates used that technique down here to destroy the rock.<eos> Hopefully we'll have the same success up there.<eos> A pulse of that magnitude would take out our entire security grid.<eos> I'm aware of the risks.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Maybe not, sir.<eos> Look, let me work on something.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> How long do we wait?<eos> We don't.
[Sighs] Where are the boys, anyway?<eos> [Speaking mandarin loudly]<eos> Amazing. They found a way to make Tampa worse.<eos> [Whispers] What is the teacher saying?<eos> [Whispers] I don't know.<eos> [Continues speaking mandarin loudly]<eos> [Whispers] Oh! That sounded like the word for "the."<eos> This is madness.<eos> [Man continues speaking mandarin loudly] You know what'll impress mom and get us up on the fridge?<eos> - No, obviously I don't!
This is your Destiny.<eos> I already know why you're calling, but if you're feeling redundant, state your need after the beep.<eos> Dee?<eos> Honey?<eos> I got us breakfast.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She didn't come home last night.<eos> I thought maybe she crashed at your place.<eos> Well, she didn't.
- What about after that?<eos> She was dying.<eos> If Peter saw her like that, it wouldn't have mattered if it was an accident or not.<eos> He would have come after me, until one of us was dead.<eos> And he wouldn't have stopped with just me.<eos> You were there, too.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> I understand, Roman.<eos> I do.
Jesus.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Okay!<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> She... She came...<eos> She came looking for revenge for what we did to her man, just like you said, and I put her on a plane out of the country.<eos> Just like we did with that whore who was fucking Andreas.<eos> She... She knew that it was catch a flight or a bullet.<eos> I didn't do anything to her.
Get the police.<eos> There are no recent charges on Perry's credit card, nothing to indicate where he and Ray went.<eos> They're in Los Angeles.<eos> Are you sure? Yeah.<eos> I know Ray.<eos> He's an obsessive compulsive psychopath.<eos> Once he knew where I was, he'd have to come.<eos> He couldn't help himself.<eos> Then how do we find him?<eos> We don't.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You don't just stop loving someone.<eos> How do you feel about Nicole and Dave getting married?<eos> I didn't know about the engagement until you told me.<eos> I'm happy for her if that's what she wants.<eos> So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
He's back.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> I have a pulse.<eos> Prepare the intubation.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Why doesn't you mom want you to draw?<eos> I don't know.<eos> – Because she doesn't love me.<eos> – Yes, she does.
Why doesn't you mom want you to draw?<eos> I don't know.<eos> – Because she doesn't love me.<eos> – Yes, she does.<eos> You love me.<eos> That's why I grew up.<eos> Sometimes, she wouldn't allow me to go out.<eos> Really?<eos> – Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm sure-- wait.<eos> Did you murder the baby?<eos> Uh-uh. No, but like "swearsie-realsies"?<eos> Swearsie-realsies.<eos> And that's pretty sacred to us, so... we'll go help you look for baby A.J.<eos> In, like, five-teen, 40 minutes.<eos> And so Conway's plan doesn't strike you as unnecessarily complicated?<eos> No, Lana, it doesn't.

- I can't even see where...<eos> - (SUCTION GURGLING) JO: Neither can I.<eos> MEREDITH:<eos> Don't touch that.<eos> It's tearing. MIRANDA:<eos> The tumor's extended all the way up between the lungs. - Someone page cardio!<eos> - It's all the way up into the pericardium.<eos> MEREDITH: Get the suction out.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Don't do anything.
Someone has to stay in case the printer crashes.<eos> Plus, I don't mind. I like the sound.<eos> It's kinda soothing.<eos> It feels weird to sleep alone.<eos> I'm not used to it. I don't know why.<eos> He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
Pretty sure I failed as a father.<eos> No.<eos> That's how you see you.<eos> But that's not how I see you.<eos> How do you see me?<eos> I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow. I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
What'd you find out, Ahdu?<eos> Casualties.<eos> Women, children.<eos> Some got away.<eos> - Some didn't.<eos> - Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
About General Shepherd's death.<eos> What about it?<eos> Have you reviewed the preliminary reports?<eos> The explosion appears to have been generated from an outside source.<eos> Perhaps the hybrids launched another assault.<eos> But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety, Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
He used to use zeroes and ones.<eos> Now, I couldn't understand it, but I had a program that can decode it.<eos> Well, black squares could be ones and white squares could be zeroes.<eos> - Simple.<eos> - Yeah, simple.<eos> Watch.<eos> RICHTER: What are you saying?<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
[quietly]: Okay?<eos> I'm gonna ask you to do something.<eos> Something that might balance those scales.<eos> What the hell kind of stunt was that?<eos> I'm trying to remind you that there are people here that love you and need you!<eos> So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me?<eos> Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?
Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?<eos> Then why are you willfully and deliberately marching towards your own death?<eos> When I came back from 2nd K,<eos> I can't tell you how many nights I would wake up in a cold sweat.<eos> - The nightmares...<eos> - I understand that!<eos> No, you don't!
A bit of Kabuki theater to impress a girl.<eos> Well, if I see Frank in Ohio, I'll be sure to send along your regards.<eos> What did he mean?<eos> What's a ménage à trois?<eos> I'm not trying to impress anyone.<eos> I was in a bind.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
There's a lunatic in Europe making orphans out of a thousand Jewish kids a day.<eos> You want two more to grow up without their father?<eos> You think I don't know about Europe? Honestly?<eos> You remember that first doctor at Mass General?<eos> The one who looked like Calvin Coolidge?<eos> A medical improbability.<eos> That's what he called it.<eos> And I told you we could raise Siamese cats for all I care.<eos> But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.
He just pushed in all his chips.<eos> It's a bluff.<eos> Now, I've heard it said that physics is a gentleman's sport.<eos> Some of you may think I'm hitting above my weight.<eos> _ I'm 28 years old.<eos> I grew up in Missouri in a cold-water tenement.<eos> Red blood, not blue.<eos> My mother used to scrub it out of my school clothes.<eos> See, I had to learn to hit above my weight.<eos> We all do.
Please, Lizzie, it is Yousif.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - No...<eos> We went to boarding school together. Houghton Hall.<eos> We were co-captains of the debate team.<eos> Yes, although I think our most heated were on the roof of Sukaly Dorm.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh. - Oh, we had big plans<eos> - to change the world, didn't we?<eos> - We did.
Come on, come on.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill each other, is that what you want?<eos> Listen to me-- you have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.<eos> Don't lose yourself, don't lose who you really are and what really matters to you!<eos> Tumor's buried in the occipital lobe reaching into the fourth ventricle.<eos> How's he supposed to get that out?<eos> Heck, I don't know, but he's got to try.<eos> Okay, tell the surgeon I'm sending him a scan and a roadmap on how to proceed.<eos> Who did the map?
The patient.<eos> It's a long story, please, just go.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's scared, you know, but he's got a fighting chance, but it's a pretty risky operation.<eos> But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> - I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
Defend Scotland.<eos> Defend my people.<eos> Are you afraid that I won't protect you?<eos> Well, what if you turn on me?<eos> What if I do something to anger you, in the months and years to come?<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> If we live separate lives, move on with others...<eos> I don't want to move on with others, with anyone.<eos> But... but you do?
Antoine is a liar.<eos> He tricked me.<eos> But it was you who put yourself in a position to be tricked.<eos> I planned a party.<eos> I am not excusing Antoine's deception.<eos> I'm wondering why it is so hard for you to trust me.<eos> Look at yourself... he's all over you.<eos> The gown, those jewels.<eos> You may not have strayed explicitly, but clearly you want more than you have.<eos> I do...
Just relax.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Open up your mind.<eos> We're gonna live in her memories.<eos> We can do that?<eos> Just take her hand.<eos> I want to stop.<eos> If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.<eos> I don't want to learn.<eos> Yes, you do.
Emily.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bartender said he'd be right back, but last I saw, he was hitting on the peacock wrangler.<eos> Daniel died a hero.<eos> Just wanted you to know that.<eos> I'm sorry the rest of the world can't.<eos> Thank you, Jack.<eos> You're the only person who has said that to me.<eos> I heard you got a medal from the mayor today.<eos> I did, yeah, yeah.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you?<eos> Well, I have swim practice today.<eos> Please, Richie. I'm sorry about last night.<eos> Me too.<eos> Stand by. I'll be right there.<eos> So where are we going?<eos> So you don't even know who this Malcolm person really is. No.<eos> No, I don't.
If your Uncle Joe finds out, he will kill you.<eos> And if we tell my aunt Mel, she'll tell Joe, and he will kill you.<eos> Nah.<eos> He won't.<eos> He was telling me this morning how glad he is to have me around.<eos> Because he thinks you stayed in town to help out, buy groceries.<eos> He thinks all you're doing is errands, not, you know, me.<eos> And have I been helpful with the groceries?<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
I was yelling upstairs and nobody answered.<eos> What were you guys doing?<eos> - Groceries.<eos> - Scratching.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Anyway, what I was yelling about was dinner.<eos> What's happening with that?<eos> Um... oh, I think we have leftover pizza.<eos> We do.<eos> We do.
No one gets a complete world, Advocate Verma?<eos> Can you tell us how your daughter filled the void in her life?<eos> Like most youngsters do these days.<eos> Objection, your honor.<eos> This case is about Siya's murder, not her personal life.<eos> Your honor, the conditions under which Siya was murdered.. ..her lifestyle had a big role to play in it.<eos> Please continue.<eos> - Thank you, your honor.<eos> Did your daughter have friends?<eos> - Who doesn't?
What's going on?<eos> When I was coming back...<eos> I tried to cut off the herd with the RV.<eos> Lead the walkers away.<eos> But five of those people with the Ws in their foreheads, they stopped me.<eos> They tried to kill me, shot up the RV.<eos> Now, Carol says she saw you.<eos> That you wouldn't kill those people.<eos> Did you let any of them go?<eos> Yes, I did.
It's just a story, Bruce.<eos> There's no Court of Owls.<eos> It's not real.<eos> And even if it was do you think we'd ever let anything bad happen to you?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> I promise.<eos> Your mother and I will always be here to protect you.<eos> I believed it.<eos> I really did.
My sister edie is getting married To don ekblad, jr. Of all people,<eos> I should be maid of honor, dicknuts, But no, guess who she asks instead?<eos> Uh... Midge olerud!<eos> No!<eos> Yes.<eos> Midge "hey edie, "let's me and you blow pam's boyfriend arn<eos> Behind the goddamn grain elevator" olerud!<eos> You had a boyfriend named arn?<eos> Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--<eos> Midge and edie did.
Hold on, um...<eos> Okay, well, where's Kepner?<eos> I can just tell her.<eos> Uh, she and Avery are out today.<eos> Oh, God, today?<eos> Okay, what are we gonna do for them?<eos> Flowers?<eos> No, that's weird.<eos> Yeah, no, w-what else can we do for them?<eos> - Do for who?
She was and she did.<eos> It was your wife... shotgun wound.<eos> - Had a baby.<eos> - No, she couldn't get pregnant!<eos> We tried!<eos> For years!<eos> We saw doctors. All of them said we couldn't.<eos> And Brenda was so... Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.
They told me I could take Michael's things home with me when I was ready.<eos> I haven't been ready.<eos> I know.<eos> We were gonna do so many things.<eos> This was our beginning.<eos> We had so many plans for a life and a family, and now they're gone!<eos> They're gone.<eos> Wendy, do you believe in God?<eos> Yes.<eos> But he didn't.
Girls...<eos> Make them laugh.<eos> They love that.<eos> You're not too hot in your jacket?<eos> I look a hunk in it.<eos> Fabulous!<eos> I'm going to a party.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.
It's easy.<eos> The reason they can't hold him is that legally it's not considered a sexual assault.<eos> I'd love someone to explain at what point it's sexual assault.<eos> We need to have more evidence.<eos> Let's not get too excited.<eos> Daniel, it's great being nice, but look where it's got us.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> It's serious now.<eos> We could go see his parents and try to work out a solution.<eos> His mother'll do nothing.
If I ever find out who he is...<eos> Okay, Dukey, save it for the ring.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> You always know how to talk me down.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm being all shrimpy, and you seem distracted.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> I think I know what it is.<eos> You do?
Wait, wait.<eos> Here we go, here we go.<eos> Whose car is it?<eos> I was right.<eos> It was my mom.<eos> That bitch!<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Uh, it turns out the dress doesn't fit.<eos> None of this does.
Uh, we do have one more question.<eos> Were there any bite marks found on the body? No.<eos> Vic was killed with a Bowie.<eos> Well, sheriff, thank you for your time.<eos> No bite marks. That rules out Rugaru.<eos> So what? A God?<eos> I don't like the sound of that.<eos> The guy Molotov-cocktailed himself.<eos> That's bonkers. That's like demon-possession bonkers.<eos> Rick did it.
You, skank. - Baby, baby.<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> Do not try with me. - Oh! Hey, hey.<eos> - You don't either, skank.<eos> - Honey, trust me,<eos> - you do not want to play with any of this.<eos> - What do you mean...<eos> - You have no idea what you're getting yourself...<eos> - Oh, yes, I do...
Hi there, Tore! Interesting inpork tenderloin?<eos> No, unfortunately I have already eaten.<eos> But I will gladly get a slice later.<eos> Just one?<eos> Yes ... So you and your brother were at school all morning?<eos> Yes!<eos> We were alone in the workshop.<eos> How many times are you going to ask that?<eos> Until you tell the truth.<eos> I do!
Let me know if something happens.<eos> - So she didn't say anything?<eos> - No.<eos> She appeared shocked.<eos> Yes, poor girl.<eos> Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
Therefore, the entrance to the underworld kept secret.<eos> This was before many people's homes.<eos> It looks different now.<eos> There was life down here.<eos> Absolutely unbelievable, all the silver ...<eos> It must be worth a fortune.<eos> This site's value can not be measured in money.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Ylva, how do we do now?
Nugget of what?<eos> - Silver, Detective.<eos> - Silver? He told the assayer there was plenty more where that came from.<eos> I knew it had to be around here somewhere.<eos> Right, Mr. Brown, thank you.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Sir? I have to admit some confusion.<eos> Dr. Grace's telegram ascertains that Mr. Graham was indeed poisoned by water hemlock.<eos> Sir, how does that prove that Jagger Brown was seen with Graham in Toronto?<eos> It doesn't, George.
- of Mr. Brown. - But you just...<eos> Sir, you were bluffing!<eos> I was prospecting, George.<eos> At any rate, Dr. Grace's findings prove that Mr. Brown<eos> - could not be the murderer.<eos> - How so? - You don't want to be doing that.<eos> - What? They're just parsnips.<eos> He was going to feed us all water hemlock.<eos> He didn't know it was poisonous.<eos> No. But everyone else here does.
The reason you haven't heard from us is 'cause we worked on him all night.<eos> - All night?<eos> - Eleven and a half hours.<eos> The good news is there's no sign of brain damage or internal injury.<eos> We stabilized his left arm and put his left leg in traction.<eos> We're taking good care of your husband, Eva.<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> There are a lot of people in the hospital chapel praying for Don right now.<eos> How you doing?
I'll see you guys soon.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Go be with your grandparents for a minute, okay?<eos> Be good boys.<eos> See you guys soon.<eos> We have the best kids in the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We sure do.
All right.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Go be with your grandparents for a minute, okay?<eos> Be good boys.<eos> See you guys soon.<eos> We have the best kids in the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We sure do.<eos> Hi.<eos> How y'all doing?
Wha-- You, uh--<eos> Did you just ask, do we have a case?<eos> Ma'am, I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a case.<eos> I am your Beau.<eos> And "mont," as in you have a "mont-umental" case.<eos> That's not that good, is it?<eos> "Mon," as in you have a "monster" case.<eos> How about "mont," as in, you have a case the size of "Montana"?<eos> These medical bills are gonna be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
- Hey, darlin'.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Boy, that really hurts, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, it hurts very much.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> You do?
Lieutenant Commander Lin.<eos> - Dwayne.<eos> - Thank you, Roy. I hope that you don't mind me showing up unannounced.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Agent Brody, Lieutenant Commander Lin.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Chief naval therapist out of the facility at Belle Chasse.<eos> So, what's with the gray hair, old friend?<eos> What gray hair?<eos> How you doing?
He's gonna fight to keep her around.<eos> Well, his sister lives with a criminal, by her own choice.<eos> Not our problem.<eos> If the mayor asks me to review a case, I have an obligation to review it.<eos> I made no promises.<eos> Well, smells bad to me, boss.<eos> Did you take the opportunity to discuss the pension increase?<eos> Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
My dad didn't give a rat's ass about me.<eos> He ran off when I was six.<eos> I told myself I'd never do that to Dylan. Never.<eos> He's the only thing I'm proud of.<eos> The only thing.<eos> Then this little nothing of a kid makes his life hell.<eos> Not a mule from Columbia, or a Guatemalan assassin.<eos> Just a little kid, with his day trader parents.<eos> What do I do with that?<eos> You did it.
Using them.<eos> Obviously.<eos> And not just to get out of jail.<eos> For something bigger.<eos> Julianna said that he had an end game, right?<eos> And that's what her superhuman experiments were designed to stop.<eos> You think that Liam's after the Ellingsworths?<eos> Look, whatever he is after, he is willing to kill everything and anything that stands in his way.<eos> Including JT.<eos> Okay, what do we do?
Thank you.<eos> It's unrealistic to think about children.<eos> Not now.<eos> It's unrealistic.<eos> - Clark?<eos> - [ Sighs ] It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine. I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
Charlie forgave you.<eos> How about you forgive yourself?<eos> Because I'm not exactly batting 1,000 here, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do know that, but staying locked up in here, sitting on the ground reading the same lore books over and over and over again, it's not helping you.<eos> You need to get back in the game for your own good.<eos> You can beat this, Dean.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.<eos> You know, you also believed in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.<eos> No, I didn't.
You smelled flowers?<eos> What kind of flowers?<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Look.<eos> We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
It means you'll keep ours.<eos> We have a possible new asset in the Vichy Administration zone.<eos> A mayor, from a town by a very important railway line in St. Antoine.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Protocol says that we contact London, but you're the one who has our confidence.<eos> It's why we send you our boys until we get set up.<eos> Thank you. (knocking) Come in.<eos> Well, there you are, darlin'.<eos> My boys treat you right?<eos> They did.
To a fault.<eos> Message received.<eos> We will work on that.<eos> - Well, it's good to meet you at last.<eos> - You as well.<eos> She don't get scared.<eos> Not Hallie.<eos> But me, I can't write.<eos> She say "Boy, you got greatness in you."<eos> You do.
I stopped believing in this war a long time ago.<eos> There's a lot more he could tell us, if he wanted to.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Your pencil?<eos> Five platoons... repositioning near Rouen next week.<eos> There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
We have to consider everything.<eos> Then there's Occam's razor.<eos> The simplest explanation is the best.<eos> I can't say I blame you.<eos> But I can't say I'll forgive you, either.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.
Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Because it so isn't.<eos> Yeah, I-I, I figured...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> On the upside, that means your mother's budget cuts won't affect the position.<eos> You know who my mother is?<eos> I do.
Remove your jacket and shirt, please, Ryan, or a hostage loses an appendage.<eos> Lift it up and turn around.<eos> Now there are some handcuffs on the floor.<eos> Can you pick them up, please, and cuff your hands behind your back?<eos> Not until you release the hostages.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No can do. I mean it, Joe.<eos> They come out, or I don't go in.<eos> May I remind you that you have absolutely no leverage.<eos> Sure I do.
I can't think about politics right now.<eos> You don't need to.<eos> I have.<eos> I will protect you and France.<eos> Stop being so strong, so perfect.<eos> Worrying about me when you...<eos> When we...<eos> I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> But every moment matters.<eos> It always did, I just didn't...
I don't want to see.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> How the hell did you even get out of jail?<eos> It's legit, I have this uncle...<eos> Forget it, forget it.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> I get that, but I need you to understand...<eos> Dude, stay away from me!<eos> Apparently, the FBI does transcripts of all of their interrogations.
Your mother and I were going through a tough time.<eos> We weren't communicating.<eos> I had a one-night stand.<eos> That's it.<eos> It was the biggest mistake of my life.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told her I'd made a mistake and...<eos> And I could never see her again.<eos> And I didn't...
You're not a liar.<eos> You're holding sensitive and upsetting information and until the time is right, when it makes sense for her to hear it, from me.<eos> But until then, this is between us.<eos> You have to trust me on this.<eos> This is not your burden to carry.<eos> No.<eos> I thought we could do Taco night.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mom, you don't have to cook.<eos> Sure I do.
So are you claiming that you had planned, at this time, to kidnap one of these children?<eos> God, no.<eos> The plan was for him to leave her and bring the girls.<eos> I thought that was the last I'd ever see her.<eos> Did you think she was planning on taking me then?<eos> She never even mentioned you or Taylor except to say you were beautiful, which you were, but you have to remember, this was two years before you were taken.<eos> We had moved on.<eos> Dad.<eos> You have to tell mom.<eos> You just do.
Yeah, I know them.<eos> What I found was, this woman that I trusted implicitly had in fact fallen from that faith.<eos> Now, I was disappointed, and I was heartbroken.<eos> But you see, no one is above betrayal, David.<eos> The president would never lay me out on purpose, not like you're laying out Kyle Green for leaking that photo, which is what I assume you're doing.<eos> You know, David, all this contempt leaves me wondering why you even bothered to come here to warn me about your boss's intentions.<eos> Well, let me be clear.<eos> I don't want this to blow up in her face, and you seem like a shrewd enough operator to keep your mouth shut.<eos> She doesn't need any more enemies in the Senate.<eos> She sure as hell doesn't.
Ask yourself where you want to be standing this time next year and who you want to be standing with.<eos> Who do I want to be standing with, Bob?<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Come on, new uniforms for the department softball team.<eos> All right. For the team. For the team.<eos> - King of getting tackled at the one-yard line, my ass. - Right?<eos> - Check your fantasy league.<eos> - Uh-huh. I'm sorry, but I had no clue that I had the Spencer Strasmore on the phone.<eos> - If I don't get an autograph for my nephew... - Thank you. I'll never hear the end of it.<eos> It'll be a pleasure. No problem. But first, we should take care of a little business.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> So you said you had more pictures.<eos> - My client does.
Hi, Jon. I'm Bonnie Wheeler.<eos> To sell a property as special as yours, you could go with a realtor with decades of experience, or you could go with...<eos> Me, the ultimate fan, who conceived not one, but two kids to shot through the heart.<eos> Jon, I know I may be living on a prayer, but I promise I will sell your place, dead or alive.<eos> Bonnie Wheeler.<eos> I give real estate a bad name.<eos> (Mouths)<eos> Mom...<eos> I thought dad burned down the Bon Jovi shrine.<eos> He did.
I'll see what I can do in the meantime.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You really want to thank me? Don't put me I know.<eos> in this position...<eos> Position again.<eos> Heather Drake on one for you.<eos> Mrs. Drake, this is Detective Reagan.<eos> Did they explain to you what's going on down here with your husband?<eos> Ex-husband.<eos> And yes, they did.
That's not for me to say, sir.<eos> Sorry to bother, but...<eos> Step in.<eos> I can come back.<eos> Step in, please.<eos> Thank you, Baker.<eos> You spun me. No.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
Why don't I have a real checkbook?<eos> Peter, where do checks come from?<eos> Uh... when a mommy and daddy love each other?<eos> That's why.<eos> Lois, I want my own checkbook, and I want it now!<eos> Ooh, I like when Dad talks tough.<eos> He sounds like Dirty Harry.<eos> You got to ask yourself one question.<eos> "Do I feel lucky?"<eos> Well, do ya, punk?
Hey, listen, have my mom home by midnight, okay?<eos> How about I plow her in the limo and have her home in 20 minutes?<eos> Ah, come on, Ronnie, she bought the dress.<eos> So, you see, Your Honor, thanks to my mom, I never had a chance to be like everyone else.<eos> My misguided carnal instincts are the result of being raised by a sexual deviant.<eos> All I'm asking is that you give me the break that my childhood never did.<eos> Dairy Queen closes in ten minutes.<eos> Mr. Quagmire, your story is a sad one, but that doesn't excuse your actions.<eos> I have no choice but to sentence you to 20 years in prison.<eos> Oh, no you don't!
John, we haven't seen you since pastry school.<eos> Hey, for old times' sake, want to buy a cupcake?<eos> A dozen?<eos> The shop? So I came because I may know of a way for Max to make some extra money.<eos> Whatever it is, she'll do it.<eos> That was my yearbook quote.<eos> I just got hired at a new restaurant that's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan, and they are looking for another day pastry chef.<eos> I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.<eos> I don't know if I have the skills.<eos> Oh, girl, you don't.
Troy Carter was murdered.<eos> From my understanding, you two weren't exactly friends.<eos> No, of course not-- we were rivals.<eos> Rivals? Yeah.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Well, with Troy out of the picture, it's your tournament to lose.<eos> Sounds like a motive to me.<eos> You don't own a rifle, do you, Mr. Scruggs?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> Everyone around here does.
At any rate, how did the Chief of Detectives find out?<eos> No idea, but I do have my suspicions.<eos> - 'Morning.<eos> - Okay.<eos> He'd never...<eos> She might.<eos> Listen up everyone.<eos> A Frank Pulaski of the Chief of Detective's unit will be stopping by.<eos> Apparently, somebody is under the mistaken impression that something happened between two people of differing ranks.<eos> Which it didn't.
Would you like to get comfortable?<eos> Get a coffee or anything?<eos> Oh, that is so sweet, but I probably should just jump right into my investigation.<eos> I love the focus, but, FYI, there's nothing to investigate.<eos> Detective Diamond, I presume?<eos> You know, you would be the best person for me to just kick off my interviews with.<eos> Sure, ready?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Nothing happened.<eos> Actually, something did happen.<eos> No, it didn't.
The gym was right.<eos> New York Fitness.<eos> Broadway and 10th, to be exact.<eos> Viviana's locker had all of this.<eos> Viviana, what were you up to?<eos> Detective Soto, please, sit.<eos> And I hope this can be real quick.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Do you feel you can be completely honest when discussing Detective Diamond's relationship with Captain Broderick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Totally cool with this guy and my ex-wife.<eos> Okay, well, I don't want to interrupt anything.<eos> So, we'll chat tomorrow.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Night.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Good night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You just totally used me.<eos> Yes, I kinda did, yes.
You don't understand.<eos> What, you picked her up after a coffee date, took her into the woods, shot her and you weren't even late for work.<eos> What more should I understand?<eos> She was bribing me, okay?<eos> When I processed her work visa a few months ago, she offered me 20 grand to falsify a permanent visa.<eos> But not for herself.<eos> - For her brother.<eos> - Yeah, she thought he'd be better off in the US.<eos> - So what, she didn't pay up?<eos> - She did.
I know it did.<eos> I think you should go.<eos> For the sake of Stacy and the girls, I'll pretend this never happened.<eos> Patrick is a great dad.<eos> There's no way that-- has he ever mentioned the book "Bare Reflections?"<eos> I just borrowed a copy from our nanny.<eos> But what does that have--<eos> Where is she now?<eos> At home studying.<eos> What does Charlotte--
Only if there's a profitable way to sustain it.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> Our network is overloaded, limiting our ability to sign up new subscribers.<eos> How do you even know they're out there?<eos> Only 10% of Americans have computers.<eos> Only 15% of them have modems.<eos> Not to mention the fact that you're only on Commodores.<eos> I mean, how do you really know that there are enough users out there to make us all a killing?<eos> We just do.
Gish is on our radar.<eos> We'll have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, until he kills somebody again.<eos> Until he makes a mistake.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hey, it's Gabby.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
This prick is going down.<eos> Voight's just frustrated because we're all taking this a bit personally now.<eos> Antonio, you looked into that man's eyes, right?<eos> He's not human.<eos> He's not even an animal.<eos> He's darkness.<eos> I know it.<eos> You need to arrest him, you make something up, get him, throw him in the pit, and never look back.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Voight does.
Ask her where you are.<eos> M.I.R.A., where are we?<eos> You are aboard the vessel tensing norgay in the northern lowlands of Mars.<eos> She actually thinks she's on Mars.<eos> Regardless, I'm gonna need to ask all of you to join me at the precinct so I can interview you properly.<eos> That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
You said if I gave them hope, they'd accept me.<eos> Well, I was wrong. Okay?<eos> I failed you.<eos> I gave them too much credit.<eos> They're just not ready.<eos> I'm not sure they'll ever be.<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I should just... go back to being a prisoner in my own house?<eos> I don't know, Camille.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
(groans, splutters) I gotta pee, anyway.<eos> So... how's it going?<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
But you, uh, you don't get to see it until Danny's been released with paperwork exonerating him.<eos> Well, that's a nice offer, but he's gone.<eos> What do you mean he's gone?<eos> I just took Detective Williams to the plane two hours ago. He's on his way to Bogotá.<eos> But you find that cocaine, and I can guarantee you that the Colombian government will, uh... will approve that.<eos> Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
If i had to guess, i would say this is part Of some larger system designed to Access pockets of extra-dimensional space.<eos> Why would somebody want to do that?<eos> I ask myself that question all the time.<eos> Rarely do i get a satisfactory answer.<eos> [five sighs] right.<eos> Thanks anyways.<eos> Do me a favor, don't tell any of the others about this, okay?<eos> I thought you had resolved to trust them.<eos> Well, some of them anyway.<eos> Yeah, so did i.
Then what?<eos> Well, the doctors said I was found in the tunnel under the highway, but I don't remember being there.<eos> I don't remember anything else.<eos> What about him?<eos> Does he look familiar?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I met him at the Dog Star.<eos> He was looking for a girl who used to work there.<eos> Is he the person who attacked you?<eos> I don't...
One good thing is that I've let go of any dream of getting in great shape, like, it's like a relief.<eos> Just 'cause- My whole life I've been like, well, someday, I should really get in great shape.<eos> Now, I'm like, what?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Just-<eos> To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all. I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.
Maybe it's for the best.<eos> That's what Loeb said.<eos> I should've walked away.<eos> I just hate to quit.<eos> You didn't quit.<eos> You were fired.<eos> What can you do?<eos> Oh, there's things I can do.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have any legal moves left.<eos> I don't.
And the bastard was intent on leaving Victoria everything.<eos> I starved him until he had no choice but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will.<eos> So why come after me?<eos> Aww, honey.<eos> Conrad always wanted me to live like a Grayson, and that's not just about the money.<eos> It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
My God.<eos> I realized I don't have half of the stuff these other guys have.<eos> Makes you just want to go to one of your houses and just cry, right, sir?<eos> Yeah, but... but which one?<eos> You know, some of these guys actually have personal medical staffs on hand.<eos> Now, I-I looked into it and we can't afford it, but there would be a small stipend for anybody who knows CPR.<eos> - Oh, I know op...<eos> I could do it, sir.<eos> - I know CPR.<eos> You do?
Let me tell you something...<eos> I like the way I look.<eos> I want other people to like the way you look, like men.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Plenty of men like the way I look.<eos> I don't mean to brag, but I really bring it with construction workers.<eos> I mean a man that you can marry and have kids with and have this for yourself.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Okay. Right.<eos> I don't.
Hell... why not make a buck?<eos> Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> Hm? Do you want to be turned out? Or do you want to be family?<eos> Family.<eos> He wanted me to endorse him for mayor.<eos> Wow. What did you say?<eos> I said no.<eos> You don't like him?<eos> I do, actually.
Please. Please. I promise.<eos> But my uncle didn't tell me anything.<eos> But you left me a message.<eos> I was supposed to keep you busy till this evening.<eos> He's sure he's going to be freed.<eos> Then he'll convince you to sell your company.<eos> (gasps) I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't!
Boys.<eos> You're probably very confused right now.<eos> Probably have a million questions going through your head.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> I trusted you, Silver.<eos> Even after your uncle was arrested, I still believed you were my friend.<eos> It was finally Selina who convinced me otherwise.<eos> I never bought your stupid act. She broke into your apartment, found the file you had on me.<eos> It was clear that you'd been sent to push me to sell my company, that your entire family was corrupt, but I still had to find out what your uncle knew about my parents' murder.<eos> Now I do.
Good to know.<eos> What's going on? Why isn't there an interpreter here?<eos> - We're working on it.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> You need to face me, please.<eos> We don't have a contract with an interpreter service on the weekends.<eos> So deaf people shouldn't get hurt on the weekends?<eos> It's not my policy.<eos> What about a video phone? You're supposed to have one of those.<eos> We do.
What?<eos> I'm taking that class again.<eos> Juanita, hi. Coffee's pretty good.<eos> The beans are roasted locally.<eos> I'm glad you like it.<eos> It's nice, what you've done here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Copy that.<eos> Flergen!<eos> Come on, is that you? I haven't seen you since Blorgenbergen, man!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Give me a hand, you old dummy.<eos> It's me, Glurg.<eos> NYPD!<eos> Drop it! Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
It's not our fault aunt Edie's house has narrow hallways.<eos> Thank you for letting me witness that.<eos> A writer can't stay inside when real life is so chock-full of drama.<eos> Like Axl thought that table could just slide right past that sconce, but then it didn't.<eos> What a great twist.<eos> And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
What do you want from me?<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we're not like you, Julianna.<eos> We don't just kill people.<eos> Who are you kidding? Liam sent you.<eos> Who is Liam?<eos> Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
We have no such boyar around here.<eos> He's playing the idiot, isn't he, Ionita?<eos> He is.<eos> - Me, playing the idiot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Me, having a Gypsy here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit..<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- It's a tie.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We tied?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This isn't a high-school soccer match.<eos> There are no ties.<eos> Uh, it's between us and a group out of St. Petersburg.<eos> $2 billion.<eos> What are they gonna do?<eos> What do we do?
The sea is very dangerous, but we got across fine.<eos> How old were you?<eos> Twelve years old.<eos> We went from Puma Arenas to Cape Horn and back again.<eos> The paddles were short, like this because we paddled downwards.<eos> That's how you paddled?<eos> The paddle isn't fixed to the boat?<eos> No, we hold it in our hands.<eos> The current doesn't drag the boat away?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Blood trail comes in from behind us.<eos> She went this way.<eos> Must have reopened her gunshot wounds when she escaped.<eos> I don't like the amount of blood I'm seeing here.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> So let's go find her.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you need a doctor?<eos> She needs a doctor!<eos> No, she doesn't!
I have some decidedly weird information about the first two victims, Rivers and Hightower.<eos> They, for the past year, have matching bank activity, and a lot of it.<eos> Like one guy would withdraw cash and the other one would deposit the exact same amount, sometimes as low as 200 bucks, a couple times as high as 2,000.<eos> They even wrote checks to each other.<eos> If I was a betting woman, I would bet that these two have been paying off bets.<eos> That's nice work, baby girl. Good job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, take care of yourself.<eos> Come on, you know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Of course.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Ogden.<eos> OK, baby.<eos> We're OK.<eos> Shh, shh. Shh, shh...<eos> Miss Pearce.<eos> Well, that was certainly more exciting than most evenings in here.<eos> - Did you see anything?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> And if I did...
She wouldn't have risked that by killing that nurse.<eos> She wouldn't have risked losing that chance.<eos> She loves me.<eos> Rose... can I see the key your brother Cedric gave you?<eos> He didn't give me anything.<eos> Miss Maxwell, your brother told me he gave you a key so you could escape from this door.<eos> Rose?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It doesn't fit.<eos> Of course, it doesn't.
Let's go over that one more time. [WEXLER] I think the plan is fine.<eos> What we need to do is have a drink.<eos> Amen.<eos> You guys got anything?<eos> Yeah, it's in the case over there.<eos> [THREE grunts] [whispers] Don't worry about it, it's not where I keep the good stuff.<eos> No drinking. Ohhhh!<eos> No drinking! Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast this momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> [TWO] No. We do not.
And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
Because that's the only way this situation could get more depressing. Please leave.<eos> I will, but I'm gonna take a pair of your panties.<eos> I'm gonna barf on your face unless you get out of here.<eos> And-and go take a psychology course.<eos> Try to figure out who gave you such disgusting mommy issues.<eos> It was, you know, probably my mom.<eos> Okay. Um, I'm gonna call you.<eos> As I can't destroy every phone on Earth, that'll remain a possibility.<eos> What?<eos> Done worse.
That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.<eos> I thought she wasn't allowed to lie.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> My vagina doesn't have teeth.<eos> Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
I gave up on my real family a long time ago.<eos> I mean, at this point, the closest thing I have to family is... you.<eos> So... how about you do the honors? ♪ I understand that Thanksgiving is supposed to be about family and being together and thanking God that we were born rich in America and not in Uganda or Venezuela or any of those other African countries.<eos> But modern Thanksgiving, at least in the Swenson family, is basically a Tinder date.<eos> It looks so good at first.<eos> Inviting, the possibility of a real connection, but when you actually arrive at Swenson Thanksgiving's door, the whole thing is just fat and upsetting and disappointing.<eos> But since you came all this way, you figure you might as well go through with it, even though you know when you're done, you're probably going to hate yourself.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi, sweetheart!<eos> How you doing?
We've all been a little busy for the chore wheel, Jakes.<eos> Yeah, not me.<eos> Bathroom's spotless.<eos> And not like when Johnny sprays Scrubbing Bubbles and says it's spotless.<eos> Dale, I'm tired.<eos> Can we maybe save the lecture until after breakfast, please?<eos> What the hell is this dude bitching about now?<eos> I'm bitching 'cause it looks like Tijuana up in here.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
Why is the house such a mess?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm moving out.<eos> - Out of what?<eos> - The house.<eos> I just put in my transfer papers.<eos> DEA won't approve it until Sid's behind bars, but, uh... it's happening.<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah... I do.
I don't think SECNAV would appreciate NCIS treating an admiral like a criminal.<eos> Oh, we already talked to SECNAV.<eos> Mm-hmm. How did she phrase it?<eos> Uh, "nail the son of a bitch."<eos> For what?<eos> Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
John Folkmore.<eos> He was an officer who responded to a majority of the calls from the Holden residence.<eos> Johnny. He retired a few years back, but he still lives in town.<eos> You think he might know what happened to the kid?<eos> It'd be good to talk to him.<eos> You didn't do it right.<eos> I shouldn't have to do this.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't.
The last few days made me realize what a mess I've made of my life.<eos> I need to make some changes.<eos> Like what?<eos> Getting back to being a doctor, for one thing.<eos> Treating people that need my help.<eos> Being accused of a crime you didn't commit is a pretty good wake up call.<eos> Seeing you again made me remember the man I used to be, before I became...<eos> A complete jackass?<eos> Sorry, I don't mean that.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you do.
They mean a lot to me.<eos> Got my tablet back today.<eos> You know, I had all my photos in there and my family stuff.<eos> It was good to see my parents again.<eos> I haven't seen them since the trial.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation. Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
Emma. Emma Wilson.<eos> She's an archeologist.<eos> She certainly looks like you.<eos> - Minus the red hair. - Yeah.<eos> It was very nice to meet you.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> So down there.<eos> All right. These guys are nut jobs at best and dangerous at worst.<eos> Now, how did you know where to find them?<eos> I just did, all right?
What brings you to these parts?<eos> Oh, you know, I miss my favorite poker buddy.<eos> And...<eos> And a question about blind spots.<eos> What would happen if I wanted to sneak into the Consulate<eos> - without being seen?<eos> - You couldn't. There are no blind spots. Cameras cover everything.<eos> Why? What gives?<eos> Well, last week at the reception when Yussef Khalid allegedly entered the building...<eos> But didn't.
Stop torturing me!<eos> Oh, for-<eos> - Ray, take a picture of him!<eos> Where's my stupid phone?<eos> In Soviet Russia-- Pam?<eos> --Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
Arizona and Herman... they're practically joined at the hip. I'll take one of those, too.<eos> Well, she is Herman's fellow.<eos> Isn't she sort of supposed to follow Herman around?<eos> They're laughing all the time,<eos> And Arizona seems so...<eos> Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
Yeah, I mean, she's killing me with back-to-back surgeries but...<eos> Yeah, and Amelia's plan?<eos> You good with that?<eos> - Callie, what are you...<eos> - What?<eos> I'm not... I'm just checking in, okay?<eos> I'm just... Seeing how you are and, uh, how, um...<eos> - Well, it just seems like you and Dr. Herman are getting along really, really well, and you used to complain that she was killing you, but now you're happy that she's killing you,<eos> and it seems like you really, really like her.<eos> I do. Actually, I do.
I will advise you, though, strictly as your friend.<eos> I have no idea what Antoine is doing with England.<eos> But if the rumors are true, you should give him the money he's asking for.<eos> Like any other king, he can be bought.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Claude is probably just a link back to the royal family for Narcisse.<eos> A road back to power.<eos> And a very beautiful road at that.<eos> Oh, I thought you didn't care.<eos> I don't.
Well, that is certainly a noble intention.<eos> But, um, we cannot help.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I let you back in. I-I offered you safety.<eos> With hidden conditions, it seems.<eos> Oh, so suddenly you owe me nothing?<eos> What about the temple?<eos> The building which, until this Jesus appeared, was the center of your universe?<eos> Do you feel nothing for it?<eos> Of course I do.
My Lord.<eos> It's you.<eos> The Witness! CRANE.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry. "The... Witness"?<eos> That's the technical term for us.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> How are you here? Oh, Abigail,<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
- Thank you, Grace. No!<eos> I was making things right.<eos> You brought us back here.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
The lady across the hall died of a stroke!<eos> Good morning, beautiful people!<eos> You know who's starving?<eos> Me.<eos> You know why?<eos> Sex.<eos> You know how much?<eos> Tons.<eos> You know how they say older women are awesome 'cause they know all kinds of stuff?<eos> They do.
I-I think I need a refill.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> He's lying.<eos> He's lying about everything.<eos> If you're right, there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.<eos> It was here.<eos> It happened right here.<eos> He must have cleaned it up.<eos> Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?<eos> If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it.
Meet my son Damon.<eos> He's here to take us home.<eos> There you are.<eos> Definite role model material.<eos> Damon really spent 5 years in a cell with you without killing himself?<eos> A fellow smartass.<eos> I can see why you're his drinking buddy, though you're gonna have to knock off the hard stuff while you're breastfeeding, mate.<eos> You know, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you hated Stefan.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But where would you go?<eos> Away.<eos> Anywhere but here.<eos> Well, you know where to find me, and I you.<eos> Miss Hale?<eos> What on heaven and earth are you doing here?<eos> The ranters are right.<eos> This is the end of the world, and the dead walk.<eos> I was told a friend of the Indians lives in these woods.<eos> And so he does.
Let's do this! - Let's do this!<eos> Drumroll, please.<eos> Ready?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yes, man! - New kid, wanna give it a shot?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What? Speak up, Mumble Princess.<eos> You sound like you were in a car accident.<eos> I don't know how to play.<eos> You don't...
Do you really think now is the time to break up?<eos> I was ready to give up everything for Max when he got shot.<eos> I mean, school, my future.<eos> And now it seems like... Forgiving Crash is more important to him than I am.<eos> - (Muffled arguing continues) - That's not true.<eos> Well, Max is fine with it, so...<eos> Yeah, because he's Max.<eos> That's not how he really feels, though.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do, Tay.
Doesn't mean you have to break up.<eos> I don't really want to talk about this.<eos> ♪ Falling down ♪ Wait, don't go.<eos> ♪ So heavy ♪ - Tay? - (Door closes)<eos> ♪ It's hard laying down ♪ Do you think they heard?<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you sleep with her?<eos> We had two little babies.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
There we are.<eos> Where?<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean...<eos> I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- that kind of thing.<eos> - (David) Excellent idea.<eos> A calendar.<eos> Wow. So helpful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, so you want to get the stuff on the list or do you want to make up the schedule?<eos> I'll get the groceries.<eos> Did you mean what you said about us working things out?<eos> Yeah, yes.<eos> I did.
You know, I'm just admiring your living room, 'cause... it reminds me of a place I used to live for about nine years.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> You are stretching!<eos> Your marriage still means something to you, doesn't it?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> I-I took my vows barefoot in front of the earth goddess...<eos> So that I could be connected to the soil and everything cosmic.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> [Scoffs] As if.<eos> Yes, you do!
Tough as nails in the courtroom, soft as a pony's nose in the bedroom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Am I making you uncomfortable?<eos> I just blacked out for a second.<eos> I'm back.<eos> So, maybe... Under better circumstances, y-you might want to stay married, maybe?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But she doesn't want to.<eos> She signed the prenup.<eos> She didn't.
This will damage our company.<eos> I should really do it?<eos> Do it.<eos> I'll report the story.<eos> Investigate it thoroughly.<eos> Oh man.<eos> I'm ruined.<eos> What is it?<eos> She says to do it.<eos> Do what?
Someone she knew.<eos> - I'm not a stalker.<eos> - How do you explain following Christine home for winter break?<eos> We were friends.<eos> Friends don't sneak into each other's bedrooms to surprise them.<eos> I'm Senior Cadet, captain of the football team, and I haven't got there by taking no for an answer.<eos> You have no clue how bad that sounds, do you?<eos> I got the message when the police cuffed me, and they threw me in a holding cell.<eos> I left her alone after that.<eos> No, you didn't.
- No, harvey, listen to me.<eos> You told me you would fight to get our names on the wall Once you got on the other side.<eos> I can do the same for you.<eos> Did you hear what I just said?<eos> I don't want you doing shit for me.<eos> Oh, so it would be okay if you were the one Who got there first?<eos> It would have been okay if you got there first Fair and square, Because then I would have believed you<eos> When you said you wanted to be a team. I do want to be a team, harvey.<eos> That's why I helped you after.<eos> No, you don't!
That he wasn't successful.<eos> And this is my lawyer.<eos> You have any more questions, call him, not me.<eos> Problem we're gonna have on this case, too many suspects.<eos> The M.E. sent her report.<eos> The vic's name was Bruce Epstein.<eos> Lived in Astoria.<eos> He was hit with three precision shots to the chest, all within one inch of each other.<eos> Bianco must've knew his way around a gun.<eos> Apparently so did Epstein.
How's Ohio, huh?<eos> Get back here!<eos> I am here to avenge my girlfriend.<eos> You take her purse, I take your life.<eos> This is what you do when I'm watching your kid?<eos> Here, baby.<eos> - You know I could take him, right? - Oh, yeah.<eos> But if he teams up with and beary and squirrely, you're a goner.<eos> Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do.
You take her purse, I take your life.<eos> This is what you do when I'm watching your kid?<eos> Here, baby.<eos> - You know I could take him, right? - Oh, yeah.<eos> But if he teams up with and beary and squirrely, you're a goner.<eos> Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do.<eos> - And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right? I do.<eos> And you know that Riley's being a terrible girlfriend by making me look like a coward on national TV, right?<eos> - I don't.
Who's Vicky Gregg?<eos> That would be me.<eos> What's her story?<eos> She got her start here and left to work JRIC.<eos> And after that, the FBI.<eos> She's a federal agent?<eos> And a best-selling author.<eos> She's written several books on stalking.<eos> She mostly consults until now.<eos> Anything she doesn't do?
[coyote howls]<eos> - I got to go.<eos> - Go away from here.<eos> You stink like a she goat at mating time.<eos> [laughter] We don't want to smell your shit all night.<eos> 8 pesos, Presidente.<eos> I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
Lupe...<eos> You're right. I'm sorry.<eos> That was very... it was a poor choice of words.<eos> But you ain't seen what I seen.<eos> This ain't about us.<eos> It's about a tyrant we can't abide by. You know that.<eos> I ain't seen Half Breed.<eos> He comes and goes; got a mind of his own.<eos> He's a smart dog... knows when to get, which is what you got to do till we whoop Santa Anna.<eos> And if you don't?
'Course I thought you'd defend me.<eos> I have been defending you for weeks, but nothing's changed.<eos> Sam, the problem is you.<eos> Relieve me of my command, Mr. Secretary, but do not insult me.<eos> Whoever you put in my place will still be left with untrained, undisciplined soldiers and impudent, disloyal officers.<eos> Sam, you said you'd hold at Gonzales; you didn't.<eos> You said you'd fight at the Colorado;<eos> you didn't.<eos> You swore to Burnet that the Mexicans would never cross the Brazos.<eos> They did.
Watch for it.<eos> "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.<eos> Sam, you can't trust that loco.<eos> This day, I'd ally with the devil himself.<eos> Tsk. Mind the horses.<eos> All right. All right. All right.<eos> - Knowles, damn it. - Listen ti me.<eos> Ain't you supposed to be with the horses?<eos> I know. Just listen. I was wondering, if we blow up the bridge, how are we supposed to get back across it?<eos> We don't.
The man retreats to victory and then transmogrifies himself by grog house gaggle into a hero... a hero that'll sweep his ass right into this office.<eos> That's President Jackson.<eos> He and Houston want to annex our Texas.<eos> Always been his plan to suck Texas up in the states.<eos> We'll publicize the fact that the... the big drunk, he abandoned his post with a wound that didn't prevent him from whoring and boozing while Texas wallows in hunger and chaos.<eos> Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
Didn't you get a hefty donation last week? What do you have now, $50 million?<eos> But that-that's not my personal money.<eos> - They don't understand that.<eos> - We're dealing with someone who's not too sophisticated.<eos> Yet this kidnapping was just the opposite.<eos> It's not adding up.<eos> Benji, can we borrow against your campaign fund?<eos> No, no, that's illegal.<eos> I... I don't know, I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.
He sounds like a formidable man.<eos> Many would agree with you.<eos> I doubt he is more formidable than General Johnny Burgoyne.<eos> When I surrounded him at Saratoga, he had no choice but to yield to my demands.<eos> Finally. I thought he'd never fall asleep.<eos> It's too much excitement for one day.<eos> He'll sleep soundly now, though.<eos> He's had his fill.<eos> He'll sleep soundly because his father's home.<eos> I did a lot of thinking in prison.
Oh, it's nothing we should talk about now or ever, really.<eos> Ah. How big, Joy?<eos> How big is the big thing?<eos> It's big. Joy, I think I need to know what the big thing is.<eos> All right.<eos> Wait. I heard you talking about how you'd always dreamed of having kids, and I felt terrible.<eos> You should be marrying someone you can have children with.<eos> Joy, you're the woman I want to marry.<eos> If you don't want to have kids, that's fine.<eos> But I do.
These are machines for killing and eating!<eos> They can tackle a water buffalo, whole.<eos> Are you not scared of crocodiles?<eos> I'm not when they're not there.<eos> Then there's the snakes.<eos> There's the death adders.<eos> There is no country on earth where the public perception of the country is further removed from the reality than Australia.<eos> It's just tourists.<eos> Hold on, what was that?<eos> What did that?
Stacy can sub.<eos> I can't leave him like this.<eos> Leave him with me.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> I'm sorry, babe.<eos> Why?<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, you're stupid.<eos> - Because you didn't sign up for this.<eos> - I did.
Where's Calvin?<eos> Where?<eos> Where?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just...<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Calvin must have gone looking for him.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy.<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
But the Pacific Rim Economic Forum is important and the delegates love the talent show aspect.<eos> The hosting country always performs.<eos> Look it would be bad form to skip it.<eos> And it really comes down to the Cambodians.<eos> They're the swing vote on the Trans-Pacific agreement and they are huge fans of Billy Joel.<eos> Oh... that's good... here's the thing.<eos> I don't sing.<eos> I mean a little bit in the shower, you know, here and there.<eos> Do you guys sing?<eos> Yeah... I do.
This is bad, this is bad.<eos> What?<eos> Paths are off;<eos> they're gonna miss.<eos> Can't be, I-I did the math.<eos> Look, the missile's coming in high.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> I-I don't know, I did the calculations, and they were right-- they're always right.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know how I messed up, guys.<eos> Maybe you didn't.
Jeez, keep up.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I found her.<eos> I actually found my secret admirer.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I was coming out of the bar, and there she was.<eos> It really is fate.<eos> Talked to her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Neither could we.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Oh, Danny, I'm so sorry.<eos> I should have just told you how I feel.<eos> But I guess I'm still figuring it out too, you know.<eos> I mean...<eos> I like Danny Wheeler.<eos> Oh my God, how crazy is that?<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
Hey, I've got Danny in my back pocket, so how about I wait and see if things work out with Ben first?<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't know how I felt.<eos> And you do now?<eos> How convenient.<eos> I can't even begin to tell you how many times you broke my heart.<eos> Get off me!<eos> I'm here now!<eos> That has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
Shut up.<eos> Have you told her yet?<eos> Have you told her how you're going to save her?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> ! Give me the envelope, or I'll kill the kid!<eos> I will.<eos> - Does she know about the bunker is all?<eos> - What? ! - Does she know about the bunker?<eos> - No, no. OK?<eos> She doesn't.
No. Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rae!<eos> Is that...<eos> Katie Springer?<eos> !<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> Which everyone does.
Before I asked you to move in with me... ..I checked there was no chance you were going to uni.<eos> I double checked, Rae.<eos> For me.<eos> Because the last thing I wanted to do in my life is to hold you back, do you know that?<eos> You're not holding me back.<eos> I went to the pub earlier, and you were all anyone was talking about.<eos> "Rae Earl's off to uni!<eos> "Aw, you must be so proud, mate." Do you know what that's like?<eos> Why would you lie to me?<eos> I didn't.
I've had a ticking off from Derek at the distillery.<eos> Rae.<eos> Rae, are you all right?<eos> Rae, what are you doing?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Rae?<eos> Why am I even anywhere near a pub?<eos> What's there to be happy about?<eos> I nearly killed her.<eos> You didn't!
When we saw you leaving.<eos> So I just wanted to check to see if you were OK.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> He's a big softie, isn't he?<eos> I had no idea he was so sensitive.<eos> Well, don't you remember him from college?<eos> Never talked to me at college.<eos> No-one did.
Maybe.<eos> You've always surprised me, you know.<eos> But no-one can plan on a brilliant match.<eos> I adore him.<eos> You understand that? Oh! Let me be a little bit proud.<eos> I'll calm down eventually.<eos> If you're proud of me, please be as proud as you want for as long as you like.<eos> I'd like to say I had an inkling when we met at Brancaster,<eos> - but I don't think I did.<eos> - I certainly didn't.
It was her in the car kissing some dude.<eos> This is why she was so eager to give Kyle the weekend off from their relationship.<eos> She's living it up in our driveway, and that poor guy is stuck at a bachelor party in Vegas.<eos> You know what I'm eager to do?<eos> Forget about this whole thing.<eos> Mandy has to be honest with Kyle.<eos> Honey, we need to talk to her.<eos> No. We need to stay out of this.<eos> If she is over Kyle, she needs to tell him.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Fly safe.<eos> Bye.<eos> Whatever you did must have worked.<eos> I heard the CIA canceled the meeting with the Mujahideen and the Senate Armed Services Committee.<eos> So, Annelise finally pays off for you.<eos> The weapons stay out of your enemy's hands.<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> I don't think like that.<eos> I know a lot of young men who won't be blown out of the sky because of what I did-- what Annelise did.<eos> What we did.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Yeah, just step into my interim hospital administration office, which is probably, uh, where do you think that is?<eos> I think it's that one.<eos> It's nice.<eos> It's right next to the corner suite.<eos> It's locked.<eos> Actually, that would be my office.<eos> Yours is the corner suite. So...<eos> You know, I still can't figure out the meaning of a motorcade crashing into a basketball court.<eos> I just, I don't...
This game is rigged.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah. I told you, I'm fine.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It just seems like something's on your mind.<eos> Just...<eos> Stupid family stuff.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Actually, I don't.
We'll be headed to New Orleans ourselves, and we're gonna get there ahead of your friends.<eos> We'll lie in wait for them there, and we will take them out.<eos> You should know, sir...<eos> I've given everything for my country... to serve a mission I didn't ask for.<eos> And I'd be sitting safely in a cabin in the woods in Virginia with my family right now if I hadn't stayed with this ship.<eos> Instead...<eos> I lost my wife... to the virus.<eos> Didn't even get a chance to hold her hand...<eos> Or say goodbye.<eos> My children did.
No! No! - It was all on you.<eos> - That's not what happened! Stop it! You were the one who was supposed to protect everybody.<eos> And then you stumbled into the immunes, and they told you that it was all meant to be and that you were chosen and your children were not and that all of this was destiny.<eos> And it was easy for you to believe because you needed to believe it...<eos> Because it was the only way to go on.<eos> There's another way now.<eos> With us.<eos> - I killed my daughters.<eos> - I know. No.<eos> No. You don't.
Got you a present.<eos> Huh?<eos> One of a kind! One of a kind!<eos> [continues laughing] Don't tell me I never did anything for you.<eos> Wow, look at that.<eos> - It's hilarious.<eos> - NO, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You gotta put it on.<eos> I promised my buddy I'd get a picture of you wearing it.<eos> His shop did the embroidering.
They were made to be followed.<eos> Nothing is made to be broken.<eos> Uh, piñatas.<eos> - Glow sticks.<eos> - Karate boards.<eos> Spaghetti when you have a small pot.<eos> Rules.<eos> Look, someone's messing with my life here.<eos> I thought you guys had my back.<eos> We do.
You see, girls, the bad thing about being bullied is that every time it happens, it steals a little piece of who you are.<eos> And then, if it happens enough, little by little, you become just a little less of who you were meant to be.<eos> And that's not cool.<eos> And these two girls up here, without knowing it, I'm sure, stole a little piece of Max and Caroline.<eos> When they stole their little idea.<eos> And that's so not cool.<eos> Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly. I did.
That's... that's your name.<eos> It is now.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Hey, this is... between you and me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a...<eos> A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know. Yeah.<eos> I do.
Who's your friend?<eos> Hey, this is... between you and me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a...<eos> A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know. Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
We need to go out there.<eos> All right.<eos> Somebody there?<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'll be out in a minute.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Didn't you read my arrest report?<eos> I did.
It happened.<eos> Juliette...<eos> So it's true.<eos> You really are gonna have a baby.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> I should've finished you off when I had the chance.<eos> Keep her away from me, Nick.<eos> Well, don't you two make a cute couple.<eos> Juliette, you know how this happened.<eos> I sure do.
You have to help me!<eos> Castle!<eos> Help me! She was never here.<eos> He's playing us.<eos> He's probably watching us right now.<eos> I need a chopper!<eos> I need search teams on every roof! Let's go!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If this is a recording, when did they get her to say this?<eos> They didn't...
Morning, boss.<eos> Where are we, DiNozzo?<eos> We are in the big orange room.<eos> We know where are.<eos> Where are you?<eos> McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?<eos> Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really? You didn't tell us?<eos> Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
Well, the e-mail just came through.<eos> It's a huge file.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I dumped it.<eos> What?<eos> The bourbon-- it's gone.<eos> What are you, my mother? What are you trying to prove?<eos> I don't need you monitoring my intake.<eos> Ah, it seems to me you do.<eos> Well, I don't.
- It's gonna look beautiful.<eos> - You gotta do the eyebrows as well.<eos> - No, just the hair.<eos> Hair and eyebrows.<eos> - It's quite blue, already.<eos> - Aren't you cold, dude?<eos> I'm really fond of her.<eos> Martin's gonna play oral sex.<eos> - But it doesn't have a penis.<eos> - But someone here does.
What if you're not the father?<eos> I'll get a dog.<eos> Okay. 15 minutes are up.<eos> All right.<eos> - Oh... Oh! - Okay.<eos> Those are fully necrotic.<eos> They're not coming back.<eos> So, can't wake him up to ask permission.<eos> Dr. Bell... Do you concur that I should amputate these fingers?<eos> I do.
Show him!<eos> Pull him by his leg!<eos> Polish him off!<eos> Zobar, make a fire, let's get dry!<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> Or your head'll spin!<eos> Alex, switch it, please.<eos> - Mom, but why?<eos> - Because.<eos> Just do it.
Not all.<eos> You're a grown boy.<eos> I understand it.<eos> You need to know certain things.<eos> I want to talk about 3 important things.<eos> Alcohol, drugs and women...<eos> You're an adult, you must like someone, but don't hurry to touch her.<eos> THE BOY'S GROWN UP.<eos> - Alex, haven't you listened to me?<eos> - Why? I did.
Come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm telling you, here!<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Why are you neighing?<eos> I was waiting till police'd give me back my driving license.<eos> And they did!
Well...<eos> I'll be back in a second.<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> What?<eos> - Are you feeling bad?<eos> - No.<eos> - Didn't you get ill?<eos> - I didn't!
May be someone jinxed you?<eos> Here...<eos> Keep on your feet!<eos> He's here, I can feel it proceeding from him!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - Where to?<eos> - To strip off the carpet!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do you want to have a husband?<eos> - I do!
- Home? Now?<eos> No, no, aren't you comfortable here?<eos> Well, I could get more comfortable.<eos> Yes, yes, please, get as comfortable as you like.<eos> Mi casa es su cas...<eos> Riley!<eos> What's up?<eos> This is our new neighbor, Joshua.<eos> Uh, he didn't know any guys in the city.<eos> Well, he certainly does now.
- What?<eos> - Why?<eos> He thinks she took Trubel.<eos> From Bud's house?<eos> No, from Nick's.<eos> Trubel came back to his house last night.<eos> Juliette was there.<eos> How could she be there if she got on that helicopter?<eos> That's what I thought too.<eos> But she didn't.
I just wish I'd had a chance to say some kind of good-bye.<eos> Look, you guys, the point is, he feels responsible for Trubel, if she's even still alive.<eos> So it makes sense, you know?<eos> He's grasping at whatever straw he can find.<eos> - Got some stuff on Chavez.<eos> - What?<eos> Chavez has an exemplary record with the bureau.<eos> Five years ago, she was given the FBI Award for Meritorious Achievement.<eos> - Got an address?<eos> - I do.
Well, Chavez is the only name we've got.<eos> Then we keep digging.<eos> Any changes?<eos> Not for the better.<eos> We're playing with fire.<eos> We're going to need fire.<eos> Dude, you need to answer your phone.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just... I came to see if, you know, you needed any help.<eos> No, I don't.
You just did.<eos> Maybe that's the best I can do.<eos> Nick is not gonna let you go unless you tell him where she is.<eos> If I don't answer that, someone will start looking for me.<eos> And it won't be the FBI.<eos> If I don't like anything you say, they can look all they want, but they'll never find you.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.<eos> Wait a minute; how do we know she didn't just send a distress signal?<eos> You don't.
Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Now, we're going to pick that up...<eos> We'll pick that up later on, but just before we move on and do the news, can I just say, if you're standing in a field with a severed arm, you don't want the NHS to arrive in a diesel van.<eos> You don't want someone coming in a hearse.<eos> It's a Cosworth hearse.<eos> I don't care if it's a Bugatti hearse, it's still a hearse.<eos> And what it says to the patient is, "You're not going to make it."<eos> It does, James.<eos> It does.
I believed I'd have him. But, er... yeah.<eos> Until I got on track, and had everything like for like, I wasn't obviously sure how it would go, but coming into it, I didn't expect to be, you know, the guy following him every weekend.<eos> You know, I obviously came in with some self belief and then I think that sort of showed and then confidence grew after that.<eos> There were 19 races last year and you beat him in how many?<eos> ~ I don't know, er...<eos> ~ I do. How many was it?<eos> ~ 14 of them.<eos> ~ 14?<eos> ~ Don't pretend you didn't know!<eos> No, I-I didn't really, actually.
9:46.<eos> Where the hell are they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How long does a church lecture go?<eos> You're asking me?<eos> Probably turned into some potluck, poster-making, sing-along.<eos> Don't jump all over her.<eos> - What?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> No, maybe I don't.
I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.<eos> I need a break.<eos> We need a break.<eos> - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
See, the security guard, he rips off this Collette fellow first, and then he goes to work his shift, and then he stages a fake robbery to make it look like it's a crime spree.<eos> I mean, he's a security guard, right?<eos> I hate those guys.<eos> Fake wannabe rent-a-cops.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just winning you over.<eos> I mean, you never said no yesterday.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Come on, you got to at least give me a chance.<eos> No, I don't.
Okay, bye.<eos> So Gab Langton isn't your daughter?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I thought we were talking white.<eos> In our culture, aunts and uncles are also mothers and fathers.<eos> We all have a responsibility of taking care of all the children.<eos> So Gab's your niece?<eos> No, she's my daughter.<eos> Either way, you know what happened to her.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, and if, uh, you can't get through, try again.<eos> Ferg, call Mathias, let him know what happened.<eos> Meantime, Vic and I will head to the hospital.<eos> Hope that Tyler's awake.<eos> And after Mathias is done complaining, maybe he can help me I.D. the Cheyenne girls from the bonfire.<eos> I know what they look like.<eos> I don't know where to find them.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> She did not see us.<eos> Or perhaps she did.
It was dark.<eos> She was probably traumatized.<eos> Or maybe she knew it was Gab and she lied just to throw us off the scent.<eos> Both Gab and Laila had reason to hate Tyler.<eos> You said there was a blood trail leading to a car.<eos> Gab doesn't have a car.<eos> Maybe she had help.<eos> It's also possible that someone other than Sam Poteet is the new Hector.<eos> I thought you knew where to go.<eos> I do.
I would, but the exorcist is on, and watching that sounds a little less scary.<eos> I can get you front-row seats to see Usher!<eos> I'm gonna need your address, a key, and some holy water.<eos> Hey, Josh, I made you a little snack... chicken and waffles.<eos> No thank you. I'm not hungry.<eos> "Where's the maple syrup," you say?<eos> I didn't say.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm just saying the syrup's on the way over... from Vermont.<eos> - You didn't.
All right. So I don't know if these are related, but I also noticed these postmortem moustache-shaped fracture lines on the parietal.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's a standard two-pronged hook inside of a high school locker.<eos> The victim's head was shoved against it.<eos> Wait, how did you know that?<eos> Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
It was my father.<eos> They had been separated because of his using.<eos> Then he just... he kind of showed up out of nowhere.<eos> I'm so sorry, Max.<eos> I'm sorry that that happened and I'm sorry that I made you think about it.<eos> Don't be.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> But it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> I don't want you to think that.<eos> I don't.
I mean, she could have died and you're acting like you wouldn't have even cared.<eos> Lori, she sent me here.<eos> I thought you came because your parents kicked you out.<eos> I think she was just trying to get me to lure<eos> Carter away from the Wilsons.<eos> I think that's maybe something that Carter should know.<eos> I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> - I don't want you to think that.<eos> - No, I don't.
Oh, yeah, and the heating doesn't work very well in here, so we're probably gonna have to go outside and get some kindling from the barn.<eos> - I'll go do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look at you all Daniel Boone.<eos> Who taught you how to build a fire?<eos> I guess when you're on the run as much as she is, you pick up some survival skills.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go check out the gazebo.<eos> Max told me what happened.<eos> He did?
Well, I have an idea.<eos> There's an event tonight at my parents' country club.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And Taylor's on a committee for some charity fashion show or something, and Carter's gonna be there.<eos> We should go.<eos> What's that for?<eos> This is gonna suck all that mean little bee poison that hurts so much right out of your arm.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> It just does.
I keep telling everyone I feel fine, except for the fact that I'm exhausted and ginormous.<eos> You got anything for swollen feet?<eos> I'd still like to order a head C.T., just to be safe.<eos> - So, your husband's in a punk-rock band? - Yeah. We met at a show.<eos> Mm. I used to like punk rock once.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I did.<eos> I rocked the heavy eyeliner, and I had some t-shirts.<eos> Sure you did, Robbins.
How long has that been going on, exactly?<eos> It hasn't.<eos> I mean, that was our first date, and it got cut short, so we didn't even make it to dinner.<eos> Yeah, no, so she just skipped right to dessert.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's not do this.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> You know what? I probably shouldn't be saying anything, but I... ugh.<eos> - I feel like I have to.<eos> - You don't.
This isn't helping.<eos> What the hell do you think I've been doing?<eos> I don't know, but whatever it is, it didn't do a thing.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I told her that you were never gonna let her get in trouble.<eos> It's not so simple.<eos> What the hell isn't so simple?<eos> She's guilty.<eos> Wolf is trying to use her to turn on me, because he thinks I put her up to it.<eos> Did you?
Gotta go, Thom.<eos> We're getting spray-tanned before the Lakers game.<eos> Our agents got us court-side seats!<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I gotta get the fuck out of here.<eos> Let's see what we've got.<eos> We have the silver iPhone 6 with HD retina display, eight mega pixel eyesight camera and charger and you got the Verizon "More Everything" plan with unlimited talk and text on the 4G LTE network, and you also got the LG Tone wireless headset<eos> Oh, hey, do you wanna look at any of the protective cases we have?<eos> Yes.<eos> You really do wanna protect your investment.<eos> I do.
Therefore, we did not find the professor, dentist and impersonator.<eos> - Forums are a dead end.<eos> - It's like methane eels in the ocean.<eos> - But how prisoners to an eel?<eos> - You throw out a net.<eos> - Or a hook.<eos> - A fake profile.<eos> I'm talking to the FBI.<eos> - We must make it believable.<eos> - Only we do it.
- Yeah, thank God for that.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> You just calling to bust some balls or what?<eos> Well, I was thinking about visiting, you know, bringing the girls.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too, if you want to make the drive over there.<eos> You really want me to come?<eos> You're not just saying that?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Of course I do.
Homer, can I speak to you in private?<eos> Can I try it?<eos> Ah, you got to be mad at something.<eos> Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you why I'm mad.<eos> A few months back, I got an unsolicited e-mail from an actual Nigerian prince.<eos> ♪ ♪ The prince needed to transfer $40 million out of the country.<eos> He offered to split that with me if I paid the five grand for the transfer fees.<eos> And you gave it to him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Dances, stores, your wedding.<eos> You don't like those things?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, honey.<eos> I love everything you force me do.<eos> And sometimes if you do all that, you get a very special night.<eos> And what does that get you?<eos> Hopefully, not a you.<eos> ♪ Not gonna make another Bart tonight ♪<eos> ♪ If I do it right, no more Barts tonight ♪
~ Oh, THAT Nicola Sturgeon!<eos> ~ Yes, Hammond, that Nicola Sturgeon.<eos> ~ What about her?<eos> ~ May, have a guess.<eos> ~ Oh, I know, uh, a McLaren.<eos> Nicola Sturgeon doesn't drive.<eos> ~ What, in Scotland?<eos> ~ I know, I don't understand.<eos> How do you get around in Scotland, if you haven't got a car?<eos> No idea, anyway, she doesn't.
Er, an ox.<eos> Volkswagen Passat.<eos> Oh, god, I hate the Passat!<eos> Natalie Bennett from the Green Party?<eos> Oh, a Lamborghini LM002.<eos> We've got a picture of one of those, I think, somewhere.<eos> ~ Yes, there it is.<eos> ~ That's the one.<eos> You think that the Green Party boss drives that?<eos> ~ Yeah, does she?
"Catch the coach, quickly,<eos> "so we can snapchat this picture of a poo I've done."<eos> They do!<eos> ~ So it's like a free roaming Wi-Fi?<eos> ~ Exactly!<eos> Do it on the way home.<eos> It's incredibly cheap.<eos> Now, a few years ago, we improved police cars, and last week,<eos> ~ we improved ambulances.<eos> ~ Yes, we did.
"You know what, I think I'll watch Neighbours."<eos> "Ooh, 6.30, my show's on!"<eos> ~ Russell Crowe started in that, didn't he? ~ Mm.<eos> What's his name, Guy Pearce was another one.<eos> Kylie is another one.<eos> ~ Yes, yes.<eos> ~ I was wondering, do you know Coronation Street?<eos> ~ Cos that's produced...<eos> ~ I know all those shows, man!<eos> ~ You don't!
~ The out...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I feel like you'd fit right in.<eos> You'd just love it.<eos> So it's a racial thing?<eos> You went racial.<eos> And, so, what was your first car?<eos> It was a candy apple-red IROC Z, a Camaro.<eos> ~ Apparently you don't have those here.<eos> ~ No, we don't.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Is it exciting enough for you?<eos> Asks the girl who got shot in the face.<eos> I don't know.<eos> God, you're a barrel of laughs today, Burgess.<eos> I want something different for my life, and I do nothing to change the outcome, and I was given the chance to go wherever I wanted, and I did absolutely nothing, and what does it say about me?<eos> Squad, hold us down on a personal at 4215 Roosevelt.<eos> (dispatcher) Copy that. 4215 Roosevelt.<eos> You really want my honest answer?<eos> Yeah, I do.

I got to talk to somebody.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Carl, you know me.<eos> There's only three things I ever wanted in my life.<eos> Be a cop, get married and be a dad.<eos> Yup, that's why I love you.<eos> You're a simple man with simple needs who's simply adorable.<eos> Carl, Molly doesn't want to have kids anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Of course she does.
And every time it came up negative.<eos> I think I just got scared that... I couldn't give you a baby, so... I started telling myself I didn't want one.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> At least, when I went back on birth control, it was... you know, it wasn't my fault I couldn't get pregnant.<eos> It was the... it was the pill's.<eos> Sweetie... it's nobody's fault.<eos> Okay? We're in this together.<eos> Yeah, but what if we can't have a baby?<eos> I just need to know that you want to.<eos> I really do. Okay!
At 16. And it was a Volkswagen family that you'd come from?<eos> Well, when we were living in London we had a Beetle, an old original body Beetle, the skinny ones with the pointy tops.<eos> And then when we moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, we got what's called a Rabbit which I think a Golf...<eos> A Volkswagen Golf is a Rabbit.<eos> ~ An actual rabbit.<eos> ~ Yeah, yeah, but I think they're the same thing.<eos> No, a rabbit's... not a car.<eos> That's what I, that's what I, that's what I...<eos> It does exist.<eos> Yes, it does.
And do you want your parents to know that you're fucking dead women?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Swear.<eos> No.<eos> What you what it means?<eos> Saw it.<eos> - Do not kill her...<eos> - Do you have something better suggestions?<eos> We must do it.<eos> What do we do with Javi?
You have someone.<eos> And let me tell you something. The Mexicans hate the blacks.<eos> The blacks hate the white. My white neighbor hates women. And my liberal lawyer hates my Republican friends, and my Republican friends hate my liberal lawyer.<eos> But the work gets done.<eos> Do you have anything to do with Jimmy Davis' disappearance, sir?<eos> I have never done anything to that man, and if you think I have, then what can I say?<eos> I understand you have made comments that you do believe that gay people are evil.<eos> Those are strong feelings of hate, Mr. Briggs, and hate can bring confusion to a man that wants to control everything and everyone around him.<eos> I believe in justice just like everyone else.<eos> Do you, Mr. Briggs?

Thank you for coming, Ben boy. I'm a coward.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dad...<eos> I never wanna see you again for the rest of your life.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I knew you might be coming along this way today.<eos> How you know that?<eos> I just do.
Representatives of the people should be honorable.<eos> They should be trustworthy.<eos> Well, I'm sure some of them are, but Washington could probably use a few more people that think the way you do.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oh, study materials.<eos> For the captain's exam.<eos> - So you're gonna go for it?<eos> - Well, it's the next step.<eos> I'm not sure if it's the right one yet, but I figured I'd take the test, see how I do.<eos> And if you do well?
I don't know, Crom.<eos> You're not without support, you know?<eos> Forgive my scepticism.<eos> I mean, you would have support... .. should you need it, against the Boleyns.<eos> Well, why should I need that?<eos> The Queen and I are perfect friends.<eos> Forgive my scepticism.<eos> This support...?<eos> Sir Nicholas Carew says he thinks... you're an easy fellow to get on with.<eos> Does he?
"Whoever can write the best slogan extolling the virtues of Wickley's bread will win free loaves for a year.<eos> And the writer's image might be used on the poster."<eos> Edna, that would be marvelous.<eos> Well, it's a good-looking loaf.<eos> Wonderfully soft.<eos> Yes.<eos> I tried my hand at it, but...<eos> - Well, let's have a look.<eos> - I fear I don't have the same powers of imagination - that you do.<eos> - Well, Edna, few do.
- I don't think so, Father.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He was wearing the coat with the diamonds and the coins sewn in it.<eos> He took the coat, but we don't know if he knew there was anything in it.<eos> Continue.<eos> And if he was a thief, he would have stolen the merchant's rings, - or his money purse.<eos> - What are you thinking, Will?<eos> Remember, Miss Abigail worried for the sailor.<eos> She cared for him.<eos> Yes, she did.
That's my last one. Now what?<eos> Now nothing.<eos> Mr. Stone.<eos> That's it. It's done.<eos> At the rate they're going, we only have a few minutes left.<eos> And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
That's 18th century occult spiritualism.<eos> That's definitely magicy.<eos> We got to find the origin of this house.<eos> All right, I bet you anything Professor Bancroft would have something to say about these symbols.<eos> Okay, so, divide and conquer?<eos> Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.<eos> Stone and I will go talk to the professor.<eos> Admit it...<eos> You just don't want to go to a frat party.<eos> I really don't.
How did you end up at the crime scene?<eos> When henry didn't return my calls, I had a colleague in san francisco ping his cell.<eos> So you found him in the park?<eos> When i got there, he was already dead.<eos> So i took his phone and his keys, And i began to investigate.<eos> And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?<eos> 'cause i didn't want to waste my time Having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No. I do.
Thank you for coming in.<eos> Well, we're on the same team, right?<eos> Law-enforcement synergy.<eos> So, what can i do for the nypd?<eos> We're looking into the death of henry graham, And we were hoping that you could fill in the blanks.<eos> Henry graham?<eos> I'm afraid that name doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Uh, this man right here.<eos> You don't recognize him?<eos> No, i don't.
Look, even though we can't approach hicks, We can build a case, gather evidence against him.<eos> We'll start by combing street cams -- See if we can find out where that s.U.V. Went after henry was taken.<eos> I'll send a team to the crime scene to canvass the park, See if anyone remembers seeing that s.U.V.<eos> You know, we should talk to zhang, See what else she knows about henry and hicks.<eos> Zhang?<eos> You guys, did zhang circle back through here?<eos> No.<eos> She stormed off that way, didn't she?<eos> Yeah. Oh. You don't think --<eos> Yeah, i do -- o'donnell's boxing gym.
- No. - It's happening out there.<eos> - They're doing it now?<eos> We had to.<eos> - These people don't have guns. - I could have stopped him.<eos> - If they had guns, they'd be using them.<eos> - Did you hear me?<eos> We have to get to the armory before they do.<eos> If we keep moving, this might work.<eos> You don't have to kill people.<eos> - Of course we do. - Carol!
- This is the short version?<eos> Like I always did, and I found out this company was a front for the Careyes cartel.<eos> So when I told Barry this, he saw it as an opportunity to skim from them since he knew they couldn't go to the feds.<eos> And now they're after you because you're Barry's right hand.<eos> Yeah, what a relief.<eos> Relief?<eos> Well, that means Barry's not after me.<eos> See, I knew he wouldn't betray me.<eos> Oh, you and Madden had a thing.<eos> Yes, you did.
No.<eos> Not like this.<eos> Philippe, don't!<eos> Ah! - All right, go.<eos> Go, go, go. - All units go.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Drop it.<eos> You okay?<eos> I had him.<eos> Yeah, sure you did.
February 9, 2001, full moon.<eos> I remember you ditched me to play blackjack all night.<eos> Yeah, and I came back to the hotel room $8,000 up.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
We're working some leads.<eos> If Ganz and his guys are gonna hit this place, odds are they'll be around.<eos> We'll keep our eyes open.<eos> In fact, we should go downstairs now, see what's going on down there.<eos> - I'm feeling lucky.<eos> - You, with the luck.<eos> Well, I'm gonna have to go sort things out with the Atlantic City cops.<eos> - And no gambling.<eos> - Goes without saying.<eos> No, it does not.
This could be a real weapon.<eos> It's worth risking my life.<eos> No.<eos> You're too important.<eos> My value to the Machine is irrelevant.<eos> You're too important to me!<eos> The Machine didn't tell you to do this.<eos> She told me not to.<eos> I... I thought I could sacrifice everyone.<eos> I... I really did.
During the period in question... late 2011, when Ms. Gutierrez disappeared... I was quite addicted to narcotics.<eos> A great variety of them, in fact.<eos> Blackouts were not uncommon.<eos> And on this night in particular, the 7th of December, 2011?<eos> I do not believe I could be much clearer. I have no recollection of this woman or anything that might have happened to her.<eos> Guys, it's a note.<eos> Received by our vic the day she disappeared, one your consultant just admitted he wrote.<eos> She was a cleaner, maybe he wanted to hire her.<eos> Before we came here, you said this was a waste of time, you knew your guy.<eos> I do.
Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm being arrested.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, you're under arrest for the murder of Maria Gutierrez.<eos> You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.<eos> Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.<eos> All I could get out of my buddy at the 3-5 was that some new witness came forward.<eos> Someone who said they saw Sherlock kill Maria?<eos> No, someone who says they heard him threaten her life a few days before she disappeared.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.
You either can't answer or you won't, which is bullshit, because obviously, you don't just look at me this way.<eos> You're capable of looking at me that way, but you don't want to let those worlds collide because you're afraid to risk anything.<eos> Because we have everything.<eos> No, Harvey.<eos> You have everything.<eos> So you're saying you want everything?<eos> I don't know, Harvey, but what I do know is I don't want your pity.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Nobody finds out where I live.<eos> I do.
I'm just surprised.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't know you played the market.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Which is fine, you know.<eos> It's good that we don't share everything in common.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> G, I love you like a brother, but we basically have nothing in common.<eos> Of course we do.
But this is like watching a super awkward car accident. Right. Exactly.<eos> I'm going nowhere.<eos> Yes.<eos> ...I want you to know this is going to be on you.<eos> We'll, uh, we'll be here f...<eos> She just hung up on me.<eos> Rough call?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, thank you, Mr. Beale.<eos> I don't.
It's a hard-enough job as it is, but with no one to go home to...<eos> Never met the right guy.<eos> I realize it may be uncomfortable for you to talk about your personal life, but I just want to give you an opportunity to tell me anything I might need to know.<eos> Any romantic relationship that could have possibly compromised you in any way?<eos> I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
There's no motive to kill him.<eos> Whereas with me...<eos> Does anyone outside of the program know the nature of your work here?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> But what about inside the program?<eos> Tim from engineering never liked me.<eos> The more probable scenario is Mr. Peterson was involved with some bad people.<eos> It seems like he hardly left his apartment.<eos> You never know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> I do.
All of the extra precautions at the lab,<eos> - and all of this hovering.<eos> - I'm being responsible.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
No.<eos> Get in the bedroom.<eos> All of you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Now.<eos> Hi.<eos> Again.<eos> Didn't you use to live in the apartment below?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You're imaginary!<eos> You're imaginary!<eos> You're imaginary!<eos> All right, Crunchie, all right.<eos> Ah, shut up, you big stupid mick!<eos> I don't think he's diluted that, I think he's drinking it neat.<eos> And I think it might be really helpful to just sit down and have a chat about your problems, you know?<eos> With someone who has compassionate ears.<eos> Is this cos Padraic was hiding in your closet?<eos> Sure, he does that here.
your grandma likes me!<eos> Okay, I was wrong.<eos> You're very popular.<eos> O-okay, you know what?<eos> That's it.<eos> Now you're just being disrespectful.<eos> You're gonna go to your room, and you're not getting dessert.<eos> Fine.<eos> I wanted to go to my room anyway.<eos> No, you didn't.

I don't want any part of this.<eos> I will stay here and I will play a clean game of golf. Now, if you'll excuse me, Fawn, I need to go find my ball.<eos> Like an honest person.<eos> Okay. Oh, look... it's a baby bird.<eos> No, it's a dead baby bird.<eos> I need to move on before I get emotional.<eos> Can't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.<eos> With everything that's been going on, I just... I feel like she wouldn't respect me.<eos> - You want to know what I think?<eos> - No, Nick, I don't.
Are you guys Power Rangers, but only on one small part of your necks?<eos> Hey, do those things need batteries?<eos> Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle.<eos> Not in a homophobic way, though.<eos> They're just fruity necklaces is what I was saying.<eos> I'm gonna pee my pants!<eos> Somebody call the planet of "Tron"!<eos> Doesn't feel so good, does it?<eos> We have three "Tron" people over here.<eos> No, it doesn't.
What do you think?<eos> I think you should stay the hell out of my business.<eos> Witness statement for the Valdez case.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Erin, this morning, talking about my mother's murder just... Opened everything up.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> You were thinking with your heart, which you always do.<eos> At your expense.<eos> I have no problem dropping it.<eos> Yeah, you do.
He thinks the moon is a hologram being projected by the FBI to hypnotize Americans into submission.<eos> Told you, certifiable.<eos> I am killing it today.<eos> This is my least favorite hour of the month.<eos> You say that every month.<eos> Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't. - No?
You don't accuse me. You do not judge me. You most certainly do not lecture me.<eos> You are not me.<eos> You wish you were me, but you can't be me.<eos> Remind yourself of that.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I wasn't implying... I have a position. You have a job.<eos> You fix. That's your job. You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...

A gold heart!<eos> Really?<eos> I just - - I guess I'm just more into the chase right now.<eos> You know, like, the fun.<eos> I'm just not looking for anything serious.<eos> Well, it's good you know what you want -- before anyone got hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course I have the receipt.<eos> Ow! ... Kay, what if I didn't?
- Yes.<eos> ...the freedom to fall short of perfection and still be judged by the same standard as everyone else? That.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No.<eos> Didn't you hear our chant?<eos> It was really quite clear.<eos> - It's quite long.<eos> - You know, look.<eos> - We want to be socially responsible.<eos> - We do.
Why do we even need this stupid thing?<eos> Because they're tearing down the only thing I've ever built.<eos> Just stand there.<eos> We can still do this.<eos> Yeah, it's great being a real estate agent --<eos> My face is on billboards and pens.<eos> I have a balloon budget.<eos> But none of it ever lasts.<eos> Once this place is gone, they're won't be anything I can point to and say, "I made that."<eos> What did you do?
If it'll help, I'll call the hotel people and I'll straighten all this out.<eos> I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way, I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore.<eos> Fine!<eos> I don't care! I don't care!<eos> I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
Why?<eos> It's a boring place, Gallifrey.<eos> I was going out of my mind.<eos> Yet you long to return.<eos> Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.<eos> But it is always the same lie.<eos> What lie?<eos> You weren't bored.<eos> No-one runs the way you have run for so small a reason.<eos> I do.
Maybe Danielle is right.<eos> Maybe Karen and Micah are better off without me.<eos> All I wanted was for us to be happy, be a family.<eos> Can you just nod or blink twice or something if Micah's okay?<eos> Thank you, Dr. grey.<eos> You know, you should try and close your eyes, get some sleep.<eos> It could still be a while.<eos> Do you think I hurt her? No.<eos> No.<eos> Ruby, you did everything right.
Ruins his reputation, right?<eos> He pays up, right?<eos> What if I told you it was Sierra's idea?<eos> Her name is Felicia.<eos> I'm not telling you that again.<eos> We had an argument.<eos> But she was high on Xanax, and she fell.<eos> Yeah, she was high.<eos> She was high because she knew she had to go through something she wasn't comfortable with, right?<eos> But she did it for the cause.
He'll trip right over that thing.<eos> [Knock on door] Hello, Heck family. [Chuckles]<eos> Uh-oh. Rug on a rug... that's a deathtrap.<eos> Uncle Dutch!<eos> Here's your cane, Mike.<eos> And this is my husband, Mike.<eos> Mike, don't forget your cane.<eos> He's got a pain in his hip.<eos> Tell him, Mike. [Sighs] Yeah.<eos> I do.
Listen to him going on there.<eos> "Blah, blah, blah."<eos> You have no idea what it's like, Mike.<eos> Oh, I got some idea.<eos> Okay. I don't know what you people did to get in here.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Bottom line... you're on tink time now.<eos> And that means no smoking, no texting, no sexting, no mexting...<eos> Yeah, that's Mexican texting, where you write stuff in Spanish so you think I won't understand.<eos> But yo do.
It's just different.<eos> And not good different.<eos> And everyone says, "Oh, it's easy to be a little gay boy now, easier than it was."<eos> But not always.<eos> Not when you're me.<eos> Not when there are people like Luke Hulton.<eos> The boy you fancied.<eos> The boy who bullied me.<eos> I had to lie for 17 years.<eos> Hey. Not to me, you didn't.
If you weren't so feisty, I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> Ray, the man who lives here... I saw him.<eos> You killed him.<eos> I put him in the closet.<eos> This has gone too far.<eos> I'm gonna get you some water.<eos> You need to stay hydrated.<eos> I know you think I'm a horrible person, and maybe I am, but I don't have to be.<eos> You have the power to change me.<eos> How do I do that?
Five million.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have to drop the suit and sign this nondisclosure agreement.<eos> Fife doesn't have that kind of insurance.<eos> Where is the money coming from?<eos> An interested party has been following the case.<eos> The NRA?<eos> No, private individuals who understand the importance of this evolving issue, and would be willing to underwrite Fife's defense.<eos> - We have a right to know.<eos> - No, actually, you don't.
I like Mary.<eos> No, I appreciate that, but you don't know her like I do.<eos> I mean, she's not gonna just, you know...<eos> Mary!<eos> Act naturally.<eos> We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
Mary!<eos> Act naturally.<eos> We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> How did you get her to, uh...<eos> I called her up earlier and I convinced her that she'd forgotten your birthday the other month.<eos> But she didn't.
It's tiny.<eos> What?<eos> Is that a small lacunar infarct right there?<eos> Did she have a stroke?<eos> Good work, Edwards.<eos> She's gonna wake up.<eos> She might.<eos> But if she doesn't, I'm gonna have to make some decisions.<eos> And you did this for Mark.<eos> I did.
Even if I get out of this...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen, all right?<eos> And you're not bleeding anymore, either.<eos> That's two bits of good news.<eos> You got any duct tape?<eos> Who doesn't have duct tape?<eos> Okay, get me a roll of duct tape, get me a fresh towel, all right?<eos> You got it.<eos> How you doing?
Uh, you don't have to say that.<eos> We can still think about it.<eos> I'm saying it... I don't want to think about it.<eos> I'm tired of thinking about it.<eos> You know what?<eos> We can do all this bucolic stuff when we're old.<eos> We're not old? That's awesome.<eos> This gets better and better.<eos> We got to tell the kids.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Who the hell's going to be able to help us?<eos> I don't know, all right?<eos> But you're not helping the situation.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Sarah's right, Em.<eos> We're going to get through this, and then we'll find a way out of here.<eos> I should... I should have told you.<eos> Told me what?<eos> - I saw it.<eos> - We all did.
My mother abandoned me.<eos> That little jerk.<eos> Where does he get off insulting me like that?<eos> Hey, an orphan means he also doesn't have a father.<eos> Well, that part's kind of true.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Charlie Greenfield, executive producer of "Morning Mimosa"!<eos> Did I finally get tickets?<eos> No, no. These hands don't deliver tickets.<eos> Well, this one does.
That's just another cardboard cutout.<eos> Ah, right, when people talk, you don't see their words.<eos> Okay, dad, the first thing I want to do is go to the United Nations.<eos> Hayley, we're in New York City.<eos> There's no way I'm doing that.<eos> I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?
But how did you have an extra room for Maggie?<eos> Well, that's where I used to grow my weed.<eos> But that's a story for another day.<eos> Never mind, never mind.<eos> Well, I didn't think she'd make it, but I was wrong.<eos> I guess your grandmother just wants to stick around to see those boys grow up.<eos> ♪ Amazing grace ♪<eos> ♪ How sweet the sound... ♪<eos> Loud singing could kill her.<eos> And it did.
It's about the famine.<eos> The famine?<eos> Ireland, 1845.<eos> The awful blight upon the potato crop?<eos> It's called An Gorta Mor.<eos> Oh. Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now? No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
But he wasn't in the city.<eos> His killer... took him to his ranch up in Wineville.<eos> Oh, God, help me!<eos> He haunts my dreams.<eos> His woeful eyes pierce me with accusations.<eos> Why weren't you careful Mommy?<eos> Didn't you love me, Mommy?<eos> Of course I loved him!<eos> At least you know what happened to your boy.<eos> But I don't.
Oh, you prick.<eos> You're gonna pull that shit after the things we did?<eos> Something real happened here.<eos> And it wasn't a dream.<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> Anything at all.<eos> You're a goddamn liar.<eos> Oh, yes, you are.<eos> You remember everything.<eos> Everything you did.
Tell me more.<eos> I love a good humiliation.<eos> What did she do to you that she hasn't already done?<eos> She took me back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Countess told me she made a mistake, and I was the one.<eos> Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.

Honey, it happens all the time now.<eos> "Cassie, where my keys?<eos> Cassie, what day is it?"<eos> You talk to the doctor, Daddy?<eos> Huh?<eos> Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
Jealous.<eos> Possessive. She will never let you take anything with you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I killed a man tonight.<eos> And how did it feel?<eos> Like justice.<eos> Like I was punishing the man who stole my boy. But you tried to kill yourself.<eos> Because I loved it.<eos> I loved it more than anything I've ever experienced in my life.<eos> Of course you did.
Between golf games and dinner parties, I highly doubt it.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> - What? - I think you're gonna love it.<eos> It's the same one you saw at that duty-free store in Florida, the one I had to like drag you away from.<eos> The one that cost like $300.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Yeah, I love it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Full disclosure, I've been stalking it online to see if it ever went on sale.<eos> - It didn't.
Who do you think I am?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Want me to give you a DNA sample or something?<eos> No.<eos> I don't have anything from the fourth grade to match it to.<eos> You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
- What?<eos> - Wingman.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I don't have to go in.<eos> No, you're coming.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about me and him... Plus 50?<eos> Welcome to Sinema.<eos> We don't look old enough to be here.<eos> Neither does he.
Flora.<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> She was never out of our sight.<eos> And besides, she was terrified of him.<eos> I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
Are you listening to my breakup mix?<eos> Since you're my best man, I wanted you to be the first to know...<eos> She left me, Junior.<eos> The wedding's been called off.<eos> Linda left me.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Zoe, we're gonna have to reschedule the bread.<eos> Yeah, Senior was so broken up over Linda, he forgot his cell phone at home.<eos> So he didn't tell Tony he was coming?<eos> No, he did not.
Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too.<eos> People you went to school with, previous addresses or how to drink liquids.<eos> That's you two done.<eos> Where's Bennett?<eos> What will happen to them?<eos> UNIT will cut out the Faraday Cage with them inside and take it away.<eos> Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Those are both you, by the way.<eos> Cooper, I'm... I'm so sorry for the way things ended.<eos> No, Gabi, I'm sorry.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> You know, you're, like, up here. And I'm down here.<eos> And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.<eos> So when I found out Josh had feelings for you, I panicked.<eos> I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.<eos> Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, listen, I know my sauce went plop-plop when it should have gone whoosh.<eos> And I don't expect you to change your mind, but I couldn't live with myself knowing I didn't do my best work.<eos> So, may I now present...<eos> Filet de boeuf forestiere with Bordelaise sauce and petit gratin dauphinois.<eos> Whoosh.<eos> I hope this cow was slaughtered more humanely than you just slaughtered the French language.<eos> Oh, it's French!<eos> Well done.<eos> In the ten years since I've had this competition, not a single contestant has had the courage to try and redeem themselves with me.<eos> Well, honestly, Chef D'Arby, I didn't do it for you.
Unfortunately, our players keep dying.<eos> Why would gray be helping Hugo Tulum trade yellowcake uranium for arms?<eos> And why would they be pushing radioactive material out into the black market?<eos> You want me to head to Chiapas, bring Tulum in?<eos> No, too risky.<eos> We could blow up their mines.<eos> They'd just rebuild them.<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> All you people don't know about lost causes.<eos> Mr. Payne does.
Given that, may I have a moment of your time?<eos> I have something that might be of interest to you.<eos> The strongest lead we have in the conspiracy against you is Hugo Tulum.<eos> Mexico's number one political terrorist. - Yeah.<eos> - I'm not sure he'll be very cooperative.<eos> He may be, if we turn him from enemy to ally.<eos> And on a global level, we also have the possibility of ending a major nuclear threat.<eos> Excuse me, sir. You wanna broker peace talks between the Mexican government and the P.L.F.?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do it in secret. Small circle.
Takes me back.<eos> To what?<eos> The '70s.<eos> I wasn't born yet.<eos> Screw you.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm on the run with a bunch of geeks in a conversion van that smells like a dog dipped in soup.<eos> You just seem a little flushed.<eos> Oh, you think we got away?<eos> We didn't.
I know that guy.<eos> Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.<eos> No, he works at the plant with me.

No.<eos> No, that's stupid.<eos> (Snaps fingers) You know what I'm gonna do instead?<eos> I'm gonna go over there and tell him I'm sorry. Yep.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> That's really nice, Danny.<eos> Would you mind not burping in front of my kid?<eos> The last thing I want is for her to pick up that bad habit.<eos> Sorry, dude.<eos> Do it again, Emma.
The FBI thinks you and your brother killed three of their agents.<eos> They're not letting you go anywhere.<eos> But, uh... we didn't kill them.<eos> Hmm. So how did the bomb get in the van?<eos> How would I know?<eos> Please... my-my brother needs my help. CALLEN:<eos> Think, Dogan!<eos> Did you loan the van to anyone?<eos> Did you take it anywhere recently?<eos> I-I-I-I, I don't...
-What happened? What is this?<eos> -I know, right?<eos> Sex vamps, solo.<eos> I think that's gotta be a personal best.<eos> -You couldn't have waited? -For what?<eos> -For what?<eos> -Come on, man.<eos> I can handle it. Did handle it.<eos> -What if you couldn't?<eos> -I did.
-You miss me?<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> -What's wrong with her?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> Stay back.<eos> Come on, Suze. Is that any way to treat your family?<eos> Hello, Suzie.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Huh? You don't have a plan, you don't have a defense. -No.<eos> -You did this to us.
Well, if the Winchesters don't have the book, she's got it.<eos> So if you're so worried that your cousin will fail... report in with Eldon and back his effort.<eos> Now, get out.<eos> -You look like crap on toast.<eos> I just haven't really been sleeping well.<eos> -Is there a woman you haven't mentioned?<eos> -A woman?<eos> I'm just saying, you weren't here when I went to bed... you've been running off on your own a lot these past couple weeks.<eos> I do that.<eos> You actually don't.
No, no, this is, uh...<eos> This is better, actually. We're not gonna be working in the bunker, so...<eos> What is this about again?<eos> You were kind of vague.<eos> Okay, so here's the thing: Dean is not getting any better.<eos> I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a Codex which is a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools... and it should help crack the Book of the Damned.<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.
See? Look. No stitches.<eos> I'm not like them. I promise.<eos> Oh, you are like them.<eos> There's bad in you.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> Now, you can deny it, and you can run from it all you want... but that bad... will always win.<eos> I'll do anything you want. Okay?<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> I do.
They're drug dealers?<eos> Among the most ruthless in Europe.<eos> Somewhere along the line, they realized that keeping German neighborhoods white is more than politics.<eos> It's economics.<eos> These guys are fighting a street war.<eos> Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> You're telling me that Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade, is walking into that?<eos> How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
Yeah, of course he wants to dance.<eos> Now he's fantastic.<eos> It makes me sick.<eos> Oh, yes. You have a gorgeous husband who is a great dancer.<eos> My husband left me years ago.<eos> I feel your pain.<eos> Look, ama.<eos> I've gotten used to the fact that my husband is always the best-looking person in the room and that he gets all the attention.<eos> When I was pregnant, women used to go up to him and say, "Felix, you look radiant."<eos> Ohh. He did.
I-I'm not looking for Mr. Right.<eos> I like drinking beer and watching football while wearing pants with an elastic band.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I should brag about that.<eos> Everybody, gather 'round.<eos> This is my daughter.<eos> She's my son.<eos> You know, Cris, it isn't all ama's fault.<eos> You want her to say how great you are, but I'm not sure you know it.<eos> Yes, I do.
And this would have been it for Jared.<eos> And Brett would have been here to help.<eos> So, Derek's back.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - No, it's just... And I'm glad, I am, for you and the kids, and I don't want to make this all about me.<eos> It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.

I can set up your rooms for you.<eos> Make them nice.<eos> Uh, Kenna, I have something that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Promise me... you will resist the urge to annul our union.<eos> - Why would I?<eos> - For another.<eos> Bash, apart from you, I've only been lied to<eos> - and betrayed by men.<eos> - Who want you.<eos> They always do.
Of course it does.<eos> I tend to get whatever it is that I want.<eos> Well not today.<eos> The salt cod was a splurge, but one can only force down so much guinea pie.<eos> Salt cod, a splurge?<eos> You used to call it "peasant food."<eos> That was when I could only dream of walking through the village with you on my arm.<eos> I am amazed at your resiliency, Greer.<eos> I knew you had it in you.<eos> I didn't.
What is this man's true prognosis?<eos> He'll die within the week.<eos> Chances are, he'll never see land again.<eos> Leave us.<eos> You should go, as well.<eos> I do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you.<eos> You can't.<eos> I've already had consumption.<eos> - How did you survive?<eos> - I didn't.
I do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you.<eos> You can't.<eos> I've already had consumption.<eos> - How did you survive?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> What are you, an angel? Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
- Morning. Morning.<eos> OK. Listen up, everyone.<eos> So, yesterday evening we ran the name 'James Sullivan' through missing persons records and very quickly we found a 17-year-old man of that name, who was reported missing in November 1976.<eos> Jimmy, as he called himself, was reported missing by his mum, who I spoke to briefly on the phone last night.<eos> I told her I wanted to come up to Liverpool, where she lives. To take a DNA swab, so that we could make a formal identification of remains that we believe to be of her son.<eos> 39 years after she last saw him. She cried like a child at this news.<eos> As did I, as she told me how she'd missed her boy -- it's her only child -- for every hour of every day of every week since she last saw him.<eos> So I'm gonna find who caused a pain that's very much alive today, who took his life, who took hers... and I want to punish them.<eos> 39 years later.<eos> Your associates here, did you do your full due diligence on them?
- Nothing on the census. What about Greaves's phone records?<eos> No, all the numbers he rang from his mobile, his landline are kosher.<eos> OK um, find out where the nearest payphone is to his house, and see if BT will provide us with every number rung from there from...<eos> When did you call his dioceses for contact details?<eos> Monday PM, just after lunch.<eos> Yeah, from Monday midday till midnight same day.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> Robert Greaves had a relationship with Jimmy Sullivan's girlfriend.<eos> Now, if Jimmy found out, got mad... .. went round to confront him... .. who knows where that ended?<eos> Well, except maybe Jo-Jo does.
It would be easy enough to discount very quickly, so what's the point?<eos> You said it. He's yanking our chain.<eos> Having a bit of fun.<eos> He's had all this... this power for the last 40 years, this secret only he's known.<eos> And now, now it's all gone.<eos> Now all he's got to look forward to is dying in some pissy prison cell with East End Arthur to hold his hand.<eos> Last night, after we charged him, I sat in my office and I...<eos> Oh, I dunno.<eos> It just felt wrong.<eos> Of course it did.
- Well, she'd just get the supervision order.<eos> Which is what she'd get if it didn't got to court.<eos> Right, so she causes the death of two people.<eos> All the pain those two families have been through.<eos> And she sees out her days in a care home.<eos> Do you recognise him, Claire?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't remember hurting him?<eos> No, I don't.
- Yes, but they don't know why.<eos> - I don't either.<eos> - No, that's clear.<eos> I thought you'd want to know.<eos> Yes, I would. Thanks.<eos> What's up, turtle doves?<eos> John, did Saga say where she was going?<eos> No.<eos> - I'm going to step out and call her.<eos> - You do that.
Ask her.<eos> - Emil Larsson ... - What?<eos> There's an Emil Larsson who was fired.<eos> Is it that Emil Larsson?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The museum guard.<eos> The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures. I don't know.<eos> Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
- Of course. Do your job.<eos> We can continue later.<eos> I wake up and then I have a kind of sack over my head.<eos> I'm tied to the chair.<eos> Sometimes someone comes in and hits me.<eos> Man or woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hard. 'Hen' hit hard.<eos> - How did you get free?<eos> - I didn't.
Peggy, relax, you're not on trial.<eos> Just tell me your story from the beginning, way before you were torturing your neighbors.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> Okay. You're a little girl in Mudlick, Missouri.<eos> Just take me through a typical day on the farm.<eos> It's pretty much what you'd expect.<eos> Care to elaborate?<eos> You know.<eos> I really...<eos> I really don't.
WOMAN: Number 42!<eos> Right here.<eos> You had to have lunch in Chinatown, didn't you?<eos> It smells so good I could go Godzilla on the whole neighborhood.<eos> But I'm gonna let that go 'cause I like the imagery.<eos> (inhales deeply) Four dollars for all of this.<eos> I mean, even if the chicken is pigeon, you can't beat that price.<eos> Sure you don't want any?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Of course I do.
Well, I paid nine dollars for this hat.<eos> Seems like we both got ripped off.<eos> - We have a problem here?<eos> - N... no problem, rafiki.<eos> What do you mean "no problem"?<eos> Trust me, Mr. Weber.<eos> There is no problem.<eos> Enjoy the beautiful day.<eos> She really said she wants an open relationship?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Sure.<eos> Well, I knew the newspaper biz was in the weeds, but getting a corporate card knocked back...<eos> Actually, now it's saying to cut up the card.<eos> No, no, no. That-that won't be necessary. Um...<eos> Okay.<eos> Suppose we can use one of mine.<eos> I'm sure The Telegraph will reimburse me.<eos> Right?<eos> This trip has nothing to do with The Telegraph, does it?<eos> It did.

What happened to your hand?<eos> Lee Henry dropped a tire iron on it.<eos> Yeah, why would Lee Henry have a tire iron?<eos> Those days are coming, Dad.<eos> Anyone hear news on the boy?<eos> The bleed is resolved, but they had to put a shunt in to reduce brain swelling.<eos> Sounds bad.<eos> She said it was a routine procedure.<eos> I don't know if Joe said what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he did.
A nine.<eos> In other words, Woodie... in other words, gentlemen of the jury, despite the commonality of the bulked right heel,<eos> George Edalji did not leave those prints, but rather someone trying very hard to make us think he did.<eos> Why are you looking dubious, gentlemen of the jury?<eos> I'm just listening, Sir Arthur.<eos> You're not, you're looking dubious.<eos> I know dubiety when I see it.<eos> ~ Raise your objection.<eos> ~ I have no objection.<eos> Yes, you do.
He's up there.<eos> Woodie!<eos> (GROANS) Bastard!<eos> ~ Thank you, Woodie.<eos> ~ Not at all, sir.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to know why? (LAUGHS)<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Hence the visit to Mrs. Roper.<eos> You think Archibald Brooks' army buddies killed him?<eos> It's a version of the events that's consistent with the facts.<eos> It certainly would explain a lot.<eos> But we need to know if it's consistent with what you know to be true.<eos> It is.<eos> You have to tell me, George.<eos> I need to hear it from you.<eos> Did you kill Archibald Brooks?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
More than any man would.<eos> You were prepared to give them your life.<eos> And now you have yours back.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> Dr. Ogden told me you were going to England.<eos> Three weeks and a day.<eos> You're counting down.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Means you want to go.<eos> I do.
Fast-food uniform, buried in a foot of mud.<eos> And it was orange from the rusting iron.<eos> So you think he killed her.<eos> He led us right there.<eos> It's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> The thing is, there were others.<eos> Four girls, all teenagers, the most recent killed a couple weeks ago.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> If you hadn't brought me that information, we probably would've never found them.<eos> It doesn't do those girls any good.
Mom, I'm so sorry.<eos> Get in the damn car.<eos> [Sighs] She's already out.<eos> Bet she's gonna wake up with a hell of a hangover in the morning.<eos> Can't say I feel too bad about that.<eos> You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> - But nothing did.
I really am sorry. I am so sorry.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.<eos> Look, about that, I...<eos> I don't always drink when I go out.<eos> Sometimes when I'm at parties, I'm the girl who lost her brother.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I guess you would.<eos> How do you forget about it?<eos> I don't.
But before this, I worked in a car wash.<eos> My manager had one of those wire-key-chain things, too.<eos> Guess who was the last person to see Laurel Ayers alive.<eos> Her manager at the taco place?<eos> I asked the guys in Homicide if I could take a look at her case file.<eos> Turns out when Laurel disappeared, the manager was questioned and cleared.<eos> You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> - You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
"An old, innocent, doddering paleontologist who works at the Smithsonian?"<eos> You were right.<eos> We couldn't take command.<eos> But we can take Eli Pope.<eos> Olivia, listen to me.<eos> - Goodbye, dad. - Olivia.<eos> Olivia!<eos> Why are you working with Rowan?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Yes.<eos> - Ever break your rule?<eos> Couple of times.<eos> Couple of times in two years?<eos> - More or less.<eos> - More? Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
It's Todd!<eos> Faster!<eos> Hey, Todd!<eos> Frickin' Phil.<eos> There you are.<eos> Tandy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Trust you've had a chance to take a look around, huh?<eos> - I did.
- Fantastic.<eos> - Water.<eos> - That's what I've been saying.<eos> That's why I planted my own garden, but it's just not enough.<eos> Uh, thanks a lot, Mr. President.<eos> Or should I say "Mr. Spoiler Alert"?<eos> What are you talking about, Tandy?<eos> My surprise, which this guy just spoil-alerted.<eos> I've made us a farm, a viable, sustainable, working farm.<eos> I did that.

You really think I would put Mike's life at risk?<eos> Ever since Joe's execution, you've been...<eos> Off.<eos> I need to know that I can trust you, that you're gonna be at your best during this whole thing.<eos> Just say what you mean, Max.<eos> The drinking, Ryan, it has to stop.<eos> And the flask?<eos> Feel better? Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how we doing this? Hmm.
When you threatened me?<eos> Ha ha ha! Yeah. Accused me of endangering Ryan.<eos> Yeah, that's the one.<eos> You know what I thought when I first saw you?<eos> That I was foxy?<eos> Clearly.<eos> That Ryan was lucky to have someone that cared that much about him, had his back no matter what.<eos> I guess I wanted to inspire that kind of passion.<eos> You did.<eos> You still do.
I just kind of want to walk the scene a little bit, you know.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, HPD's already been out here.<eos> Lou, what's going on?<eos> Me and Clay, we come up together.<eos> Went to the academy together.<eos> Walked the beat together.<eos> I known the man 25 years.<eos> In a lot of ways, we know each other better than our wives do.<eos> Did.
People are dead.<eos> Thousands of lives are ruined because of you.<eos> - And I'm sorry for that, Lisa.<eos> I feel terrible for every single person that I have hurt.<eos> I carry it with rne everywhere that I go.<eos> - And what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?<eos> - No.<eos> You are supposed to feel everything that you're feeling.<eos> - These people that you hurt, I bet you don't even know who they are.<eos> - I don't.
Anyone caught out of the light died.<eos> They were flayed to the bone.<eos> There were so many people killed.<eos> Husbands lost wives.<eos> Mothers lost daughters.<eos> And you managed to miss every awful part of it.<eos> - Do you know why I missed it all?<eos> - Because you don't care!<eos> - No, I do care.<eos> And I did Trouble all of those people.
- Nathan?<eos> Lisa, Nathan's coming.<eos> We're gonna end the Troubles, I promise.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Things are gonna get better for you.<eos> I want you to tell your little brother he's got one hell of an arm.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Hailie, you have to keep it open.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
- But how do we get him in there to face him?<eos> - We hypnotize Dave.<eos> Get him to go into his own mind.<eos> Cast out Croatoan and destroy him.<eos> This is a job for the Iron Maiden.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Please, think I want to be stuck here with you?<eos> That thinny was my ticket out of here.<eos> Don't pretend you don't love this.<eos> - I kind of do.
Killing a police officer is a capital offense.<eos> That makes you eligible for the death penalty.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Right. Which is why we found you on a bus fleeing the country.<eos> We want the people you work for. Give them to us, and we'll talk to the U.S. attorney. Recommend a life sentence.<eos> You do enough you might even get the possibility of parole.<eos> Julian Powell.<eos> That's who paid me.<eos> A doctor named Julian Powell.<eos> - To do what?
I told you once before when you held a knife to my throat, I am ready for hell.<eos> But let me say two words before you do...<eos> Mary Sibley.<eos> What about her?<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
I write with that hand.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I've been watching you.<eos> What were you doing at St Bartholomew's yesterday?<eos> I wanted to write about the lecture.<eos> Why that one?<eos> It was interesting.<eos> Yeah, that is one way of describing it.<eos> How did you know to be there?<eos> The same way that you did.
What? Wait, really?<eos> I'm feeling some scar tissue.<eos> You may have plantar fasciitis.<eos> Dear!<eos> It's nothing serious, but any pressure to your foot can cause a flare up.<eos> Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> I do.
That's my daughter on the right.<eos> And that's Ashley standing next to her.<eos> Well, her real name's Heather.<eos> And, she is my granddaughter.<eos> And I can see the family resemblance.<eos> So you knew?<eos> That you and Heather connected, yes, I had a feeling.<eos> But she doesn't know you.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, she doesn't.
And no one has said anything about you and Ryan dating, that's funny huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we've been, you know, keeping it kind of quiet.<eos> Yep.<eos> I know Ryan, we almost got married, and he's good at a lot of things, but lying is not one of them.<eos> You two aren't really dating, are you?<eos> I know I'm right, I do! And, and...<eos> I know why Ryan would lie, but what I don't get is why you would go along with it.<eos> I just have to ask, why do you care so much who Ryan does or doesn't date?<eos> I... don't care.<eos> No, you do.
No, I can't.<eos> Because I'm the only one left with a grip on her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died.<eos> You do?<eos> We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.<eos> I feel very connected to Grace in a way that maybe you...<eos> Abigail, I know you mean well...<eos> - I do.
We have a date.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> It was a pleasure talking to you.<eos> You, too.<eos> So, I heard you're selling Keating house to a developer.<eos> Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is the best option for our town?<eos> I don't have the choice.<eos> - Sure you do. No, I don't.
Finally, something that we can agree on!<eos> I'm looking for...<eos> - Sam? Yes.<eos> - Yeah, you're late.<eos> She didn't want to wait anymore.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> I thought you didn't want to talk about it?<eos> I don't.
The door's open, Sam.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - Scotch.<eos> - Ooh, I have tea.<eos> - Well, I'll drink it and pretend it's scotch.<eos> Make mine a double.<eos> I got your text.<eos> - I'm glad Grace is okay.<eos> - And I'm glad Nick came back.<eos> He did.
You did?<eos> But he won't budge.<eos> Seems he's got big plans for your shop that don't include you.<eos> It's hard to believe Ryan's involved. - Yeah, Jones is the buyer... you didn't know?<eos> Ryan's Jones?<eos> Yeah. One and the same.<eos> - He didn't tell you?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
I hate this.<eos> Basketball?<eos> My parents.<eos> I'm stuck between them and they really hate each other.<eos> Dad wants me to stay here, and Mom wants me to go with her.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - I just do.
- No, go on, say it.<eos> - Tara needs you too, right?<eos> I mean, everything is gonna get settled, right?<eos> I mean, hopefully Cassie's shop stays right where it is, but this isn't gonna go on forever.<eos> And once things are settled, you could go be with Tara in England.<eos> That's true.<eos> Tara is family.<eos> So, is this really about Cassie?<eos> I... I still cannot believe that you left New York for this.<eos> I did.
- What's up, brother?<eos> - What's up, man?<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, too.<eos> How's it going? Everything is good.<eos> This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.<eos> Dan, what's going on, man?<eos> Great to meet you. Good to meet you.<eos> All right, and this is the big man right here. What's up, little man?<eos> - How you doing?
We tell the Russians we're going down to get those men out, they will refuse.<eos> And they're close enough now to send out a missile of their own, and destroy it themselves before we'll get a chance to touch it.<eos> So, no good options.<eos> Ostrov will never admit failure, concede that one of his crews mutinied.<eos> Not in public.<eos> There may be a way to resolve this.<eos> A deal that even he can live with.<eos> But we're gonna need to go through back channels.<eos> And we happen to have one.<eos> We do.
Also protocol.<eos> Listen, Mike, I hear everything that you are saying. I really do. But I am the verge of a major breakthrough.<eos> And every minute that I'm not working is a minute... I hear you, too, Dr. Scott.<eos> Nevertheless, I have to do this.<eos> The more you argue, the longer it will take, so...<eos> Tell me again, when did you first notice Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And? Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
But they will make a mistake, and we will be there to catch them.<eos> We?<eos> I can get past our history... If you can...<eos> For Victoria.<eos> I hope she's all right tonight.<eos> Aww. You missed your flight.<eos> Seeing that look on your face almost makes the past year worthwhile, the key word being "almost."<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yes, we did.
You know I love Justin, Mom,<eos> - right?<eos> - I know.<eos> But... do you think<eos> - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby.<eos> - ... that he would come? - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Hmm. Okay, then.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Oh. I'm on your side, Dr. Brennan.<eos> When the benefits of one mate diminish, it only makes sense to search for another mate...<eos> Not today, Ms. Warren.<eos> Well, I'm just trying to support Dr. B. She's been going...<eos> I don't need my situation explained to me, Ms. Warren.<eos> And your support will not hasten its resolution.<eos> If you need to get that...<eos> I-I don't...
I'm here because I want to do the right thing.<eos> So you gonna give me the job or not?<eos> You take the autobahn across the Reich.<eos> You stop here, Canon City.<eos> That's the neutral zone.<eos> Wow, he can read a map too, huh?<eos> - What am I gonna do there?<eos> - You wait.<eos> Your contact will approach you when and if he determines it's safe.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Sounds like the rats are restless.<eos> Ugh. Like, actual torture.<eos> Elena and Damon talking about their future together.<eos> Echh. Just... I want to die.<eos> They'll make a mistake eventually, and when they do, we will pounce and drain the first person we can get our teeth on.<eos> What I would do for just a sip of human blood.<eos> You know when you're feeding on someone's neck and their artery's still pulsing?<eos> I really love that.<eos> I thought your veins felt like sandpaper.<eos> They do.
Right.<eos> I don't want to know what Ric's doing, do I?<eos> Probably at the movies.<eos> Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it? - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
Do you have to go?<eos> If you stay, I can make it worth your while.<eos> Tempting as that is,<eos> I doubt the king would understand.<eos> Francis is relying on your services more and more every day.<eos> You keep this up, you could become his lead general. What?<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> And I want to have my way with you without worrying who might see us.<eos> I thought that added to the allure.<eos> It did, at first.
Adrenaline rush.<eos> Oh, and I found this when I removed her clothes, stuffed in her brassiere.<eos> Blood?<eos> Possibly the victim's.<eos> If so, it would suggest it was put there postmortem.<eos> Killer with a cause?<eos> Killer with a logo.<eos> Questionable human behavior that requires further study?<eos> I thought I came in as next of kin.<eos> You did.
Enough!<eos> Dale!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
- not a counselor. - Uh, just... think about it.<eos> And... do you think you could find your nephew?<eos> I didn't see him here.<eos> She called you "Dale."<eos> Julia, I said I don't want to talk about it.<eos> The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here, in the flesh.<eos> Of course I have questions.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Lady, you lost the right to tell me what to do when you let Junior Rennie take his toy hammer to that column.<eos> This is on you! All right, all right.<eos> Hey, hey... we don't need to make a scene, all right?<eos> I want that man out of this building.<eos> - I got this, Christine.<eos> - He's a menace.<eos> I said I've got this.<eos> Look, no hard feelings, all right?<eos> It was just starting to get a little tense there.<eos> How about we do this:
Well, a piglet, actually, so there's only enough for a few VIPs.<eos> We'll make it our secret.<eos> I have to prioritize, which doesn't always sit well with the people who think they're getting the short end of the stick.<eos> I underestimated you, Pete.<eos> You're a man who listens to his instincts and does what he has to do to be heard.<eos> The problem is, is not everyone respects your initiative.<eos> Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling, that you're responsible for the deaths - of those two people.<eos> - What? Hey, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did. And I understand why.<eos> But Barbie doesn't.
Now, I'm not gonna bail on being a father.<eos> That child is innocent of all of this.<eos> Barbie, your daughter...<eos> Whoa, my daughter what?<eos> Christine kept detailed notes on a voice recorder.<eos> It's an instruction manual on how to use us to keep the life force alive.<eos> She made it for her successor, the next queen.<eos> And she paired you and Eva together for a reason.<eos> Your daughter is that queen.<eos> So Christine did this.
I knew you weren't one of us.<eos> Julia is still alive, isn't she?<eos> I bet she's...<eos> What did you put in the tea?<eos> I had to, Eva.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
- No. No, I can't.<eos> Sorry, I got to find her.<eos> Barbie, they are gonna have her hidden, under heavy guard.<eos> - This is their new queen.<eos> - That's ridiculous!<eos> She's a baby! She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
She loves you.<eos> I told her I wouldn't wait.<eos> The only thing stopping you from choosing Jack is you.<eos> I don't deserve him!<eos> - But you deserve me?<eos> - Ben, I'm sorry.<eos> Jack's flight leaves in 20 minutes.<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Hey, uh, thought I'd give you at least 24 hours without any Hamptons drama.<eos> It's kind of hard to avoid when it's all over the news.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> All things considered, Ems is doing okay.<eos> I'm not calling about how she's doing.<eos> I'm calling about what she did.<eos> They're saying that Victoria committed suicide.<eos> But please tell me that this isn't just some sort of poetic end to Emily's revenge plan, that she's not that far gone.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, Vickie did herself in.
She didn't show any of the usual signs.<eos> Oh, Louise.<eos> It's normal to look for answers at a time like this.<eos> But we read her note.<eos> She was resolute in her decision.<eos> Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
Redmayne will get just as angry if she delays.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Men like him don't want you to say yes, they want you to say, "I'm listening."<eos> They want to be able to tell their friends,<eos> "I have the ear of the SA. She listens to me."<eos> He's rich, he's forgetful.<eos> Alicia, look at me!<eos> I know of which I speak, and you don't.<eos> And you don't either.<eos> So what do I do?
How dare you take advantage of my girl when she was in a vulnerable spot?<eos> Hey, man, don't worry.<eos> I only had sex with her to piss Shane off.<eos> Kick his ass.<eos> I'll let go if you drop this and leave.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Uncle, uncle. You disgust me.<eos> Come on, babe.<eos> Hey. Thanks for having my back.<eos> I don't.
Apparently, you were just named Spring Dance Princess somehow.<eos> Mm-hmm, what am I always telling you guys?<eos> I'm royalty.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> We go in strong and we go in fast.<eos> Evans, you're on door breach.<eos> Patterson... flashbang.<eos> Boyle, stop squatting like that.<eos> Sorry, I thought it looked cool.<eos> - It didn't.
- I disabled the app.<eos> - Not well enough.<eos> You were home.<eos> You didn't do it.<eos> Hmm. You seem disappointed.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Let me see your phone.<eos> I disabled tracking and the encrypted uplink, like you could have if you'd known how.<eos> Well, don't feel bad.<eos> Not many people do.
And now you know how I feel.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?<eos> When I first got back, you said you'd moved on. You were good. And now, all of a sudden you're spying on me<eos> What is that all about?<eos> Do you really want to know what that's all about or are you just gonna jump on another plane when things get too difficult?<eos> So you are mad.<eos> You pulled the rug out from under me, Gabi!<eos> You left me like a smiling idiot at Elliot's engagement party!<eos> I told you I loved you, I kissed you, and I know that meant something to you.<eos> - It did.
Sorry.<eos> Can you...<eos> For obvious reasons.<eos> Kids, Cheerios.<eos> You think she deleted the e-mail for Prima?<eos> Well, she was the only one in the department with access to his account.<eos> I was wondering if you guys had any other thoughts.<eos> Why would we have thoughts?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Do you?
Hey.<eos> Todd, I'm so sorry.<eos> I-I had no idea that thing with Tandy happened.<eos> I just want you to know that I'm here if you ever need to tell me anything.<eos> Like someone's trying to murder you.<eos> Well, I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Hey, Melissa.<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't expect you to say it back, but I'm not gonna pretend that I don't love you.<eos> 'Cause I do.
I mean, I've already been here much longer than I thought I would be.<eos> But you have friends here.<eos> That's the tough part.<eos> You, mostly.<eos> Everything you know is here.<eos> Yeah, but that's just it.<eos> I don't want to know everything in my life.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
Oh I am So sorry!<eos> I feel so bad for you Veer.<eos> You feel for me?<eos> Yeah...it's because of me Come here. Sit here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Huh!<eos> But yet...my head wants to share its personal feelings with you.<eos> Go ahead, Veer.<eos> Do you know what brother did after seeing the car in this condition?<eos> What did he do?
- It's just an expression.<eos> Don't people say "Oh my, God" when someone separates.<eos> Peter...cut-off that customer's finger.<eos> Who keeps pressing the remote so frequently?<eos> Brother Shakti, I remember when dad and brother used to come meet me at the hostel they always wore good clothes and came in big cars, we were rich.<eos> Because your brother was a washerman.<eos> He used to wear his customer's clothes.<eos> And your dad was a mechanic.<eos> He would drive his customer's car.<eos> Just like you do.
All five pints of her.<eos> 'Wonderful. Bring her here.'<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I'm not going to do that.<eos> I'm keeping her as an insurance policy.<eos> Oh, and by the way, I had to get rid of your little Irish lapdog.<eos> - 'What have you done to her?<eos> - She'll live. Which is more than I would have, right?<eos> 'I don't know what you mean.'<eos> Yes, you do, Grandma.
Drew invited us to Portland for the weekend just to get a feel for the place, but we wouldn't move there till the end of the school year. Great.<eos> Bring a raincoat and a mosquito net.<eos> Okay, you're obviously upset with me.<eos> You come onto our team, mess up with Walt's head, and get us used to having that kid around, and then you up and leave.<eos> We were all good before you came along.<eos> I am doing it for the sake of my son.<eos> And for the record, before I came along, you guys were a disaster.<eos> You've wormed your way into Walt's head, and that is a big reason why he's MIA right now.<eos> I don't need to listen to this.<eos> Then don't!
I know you don't want to discuss it, but you should know if there is a referendum to abolish the Monarchy... I know which way I'll vote.<eos> Tonight could be every night.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> The Sultan of Bhondai just cock-blocked us.<eos> What?<eos> The villa in Monaco is out.<eos> We got bumped.<eos> Are we okay with that?<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> - Of course we do.
Oh, stop being so bloody English and spit it out.<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> Public sentiment towards the Monarchy is at an all-time low.<eos> If a vote on a referendum is brought to the floor, it will not only pass, I believe it will do so with a huge majority.<eos> And if the House of Lords does try to delay such a bill, there will be rioting in the streets.<eos> They will have our heads.<eos> Which is why I've taken steps to ensure that if such a bill passes, it won't be with a sweeping majority.<eos> Forgive me, Your Highness, but how on earth can you ensure that?<eos> I believe you know James Holloway.<eos> I do indeed.
It's not even worth talking about.<eos> You were naked with two strangers, Paul.<eos> Trust me, it's worth it.<eos> We were ta...<eos> What? Speak up, Paul, I can't hear you.<eos> We were talking about the barriers that people put up, and it turned into this... this thing about clothes and how they're just... just... another barrier that we use to keep ourselves from ever really seeing each other.<eos> Wow. That's deep.<eos> So that's the kind of philosophical brilliance you come up with when you're smoking meth, Paul?<eos> Meth?<eos> They did that.
I didn't know he was gonna do that, man, you gotta believe me.<eos> This shit is wrong, man.<eos> Shane was my friend.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
I love you.<eos> I don't think those windows open.<eos> You're not supposed to be in here, you know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I heard after what happened last week they're only letting immediate family in.<eos> Jocelyn got 'em to make an exception for me.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> I mean, after all, you are his best friend.<eos> Hmm. Must have been hard staying friends with him, though, right?<eos> I mean, after what he did to you?<eos> What he did to me?
Look, look, you were right.<eos> That gun, it is going to protect you.<eos> It's going to protect me too.<eos> From my memory.<eos> You remember?<eos> Not the screams in the dark, not everything breaking, but when we spoke all night until the light came in with the Dominican music from the neighbors.<eos> Kissing in the cab, in the club.<eos> Telling me your dreams about tidal waves over the phone during finals.<eos> Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room with a burning hot pipe.<eos> I do."
In what world does that make sense?<eos> In a world where she was having an affair with our son.<eos> That world does not exist.<eos> PJ never even met her.<eos> Crys, I'm right about this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.

You must really like this Alicia girl.<eos> I mean, I feel sorry for her.<eos> She's just a little girl.<eos> She has friends.<eos> I mean, like, real friends.<eos> I mean, maybe you can call it that.<eos> What about us?<eos> I thought we were friends, and then you wait until my husband's stalking people before you tell me anything.<eos> This ain't dirt on the preacher, this is dirt on the girl, and I don't think she deserves to be hurt.<eos> Pernell does?
- I need people I can count on.<eos> You're questioning my loyalty after everything I've done for you and this company?<eos> Everything that you wanted, everything that you needed, I gave to you.<eos> It's simple, Anne.<eos> I can't trust you anymore.<eos> No trust, no relationship, no job.<eos> You at least owe me an opportunity to fix this.<eos> You can't end it on one mistake.<eos> You make it sound like we need to stay together for the sake of the kids.<eos> We don't.
It's not our first time hunting together.<eos> Uh, I already told you-- wild boar.<eos> Yeah, that's what they hunt here in Hawaii.<eos> They're all over the place.<eos> Yeah, the, uh...<eos> the-the little... the little piggies with the tusks.<eos> Look, you're probably married, right?<eos> So, you know how it is.<eos> No!<eos> I don't.
Done.<eos> Why would you even bring up her name here?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hi. I'm guessing you guys aren't here for the Beer Pong, Panty Jam this afternoon.<eos> The Beer...<eos> No, no.<eos> I don't know if I want to know what that is.<eos> No, you probably don't.
He's nervous.<eos> Of course he's nervous.<eos> He just killed Kyle Ford.<eos> We don't know that, Jim.<eos> He's flying on a stolen passport.<eos> He requested a seat in the back near the cargo hold.<eos> You saw the video.<eos> Ford was watching him, and now he's dead.<eos> Debbie, you can't tell me he doesn't meet the criteria for posing a threat to passengers and crew.<eos> No, he definitely does.
- Must be some kind of banking error.<eos> - No, it's not. Both of your financial institutions confirmed it.<eos> It isn't a crime to give a gift.<eos> Oh, so it's a gift now?<eos> To someone that you don't even know?<eos> What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?<eos> This has been delightful, but I'm afraid I have to go.<eos> Um, no. You're...<eos> you're not going anywhere. You have no cause to hold me.<eos> Actually, we do.
Andrew Campbell and Charles DiLaurentis are the same person.<eos> That's what we're saying, right?<eos> We're not just saying it, it's reality.<eos> Reality's been through a lot, and so have we.<eos> You guys, it makes perfect sense.<eos> 'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.'<eos> 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.

Anything you say can and will be used 'against you in a court of law.'<eos> ♪ Swear this one you'll save ♪<eos> ♪ Better lock it in your pocket ♪<eos> ♪ If one of them is dead ♪<eos> You had no right to put yourself in that much danger.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> I did help.<eos> We saved them.<eos> You had no obligation.<eos> Yes, I did.
What would have happened if I'd been down there for years?<eos> Emily, the person who did this is behind bars.<eos> You mean, there isn't any more bad people out there?<eos> There's nobody who's ever gonna hurt anybody again?<eos> A gun isn't gonna change that.<eos> Not for you, not for anyone.<eos> 'I know.'<eos> I was afraid.<eos> And I thought.. ...maybe it could take away some of the fear.<eos> But it didn't.
'<eos> - Louisa?<eos> - 'Hello?<eos> '<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Louisa?<eos> Louisa?<eos> - I told you to get a new tub. - Huh?<eos> No, you didn't.
Get on the examination table.<eos> Oh, doc... Look, my dad, he worked the fishing boats...<eos> Really?<eos> And he started getting this terrible cough, but he kept working for months, until eventually my mum convinces him to go and see the doctor.<eos> Three days later he drops dead.<eos> So, you see what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, he should have seen his doctor sooner.<eos> Climb onto the table and pull your pants down to just above the knee and put your hands by your side.<eos> Give me a hand here, doc.<eos> - You do the pants.
Have you been taking any other medication that you haven't told me about?<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You deceived me over a urine test.<eos> What are you trying to hide?<eos> I'm not trying to hide anything, doc.<eos> I was just trying to compete.<eos> What do you mean, compete?<eos> All the young lads looking at me like I was over, finished.<eos> I had to show them. You understand, right?<eos> No, I don't.
I hope you guys can hear me.<eos> This thing really itches.<eos> I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, Ms. Clark.<eos> Um, you've met my research assistant, George Adler.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll be taking notes as Dr. Zuber does the evaluation.<eos> Uh... evaluation?<eos> It's something we use to see if you're a potential candidate for the program.<eos> Did Dani help you build that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Tell Faisel who kidnapped his wife before your wives have no husband.<eos> I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Maybe Faisel can help you remember.<eos> He killed one of my fighters, and he took my wife.<eos> Tell me where this man is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.
We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Lebanon.<eos> He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
_<eos> _<eos> And then after a while, he asked me if I wanted to come in.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> How Kyle was doing.<eos> Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
- Now move your truck.<eos> - John, listen to me.<eos> Isaac didn't do anything.<eos> There was a palm print on the car that my daughter was in.<eos> Like it was left for me. A goddamn palm print.<eos> Lucky duck.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Now I'm going to take care of it.<eos> Looks like you framed someone without even trying.<eos> - Isaac didn't do anything.
I thought I was dreaming, but she was back.<eos> I said we should go to the hospital, but Mary, she just wanted to talk.<eos> The last thing she remembered was the accident, so I told her everything that happened since.<eos> We talked for hours.<eos> And we cried.<eos> Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.<eos> And when I woke up, she was like this again.<eos> For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.<eos> Maybe they don't believe me.<eos> Maybe you don't.
You're welcome.<eos> You should get it looked at in case it needs to be set.<eos> Erika will take care of him once we get back into town.<eos> My wife's a doctor.<eos> I'll be fine. Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry about your daughter.<eos> I've been handing out fliers at the church.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Try to keep it elevated.<eos> I always do.
It, uh, doesn't really work that way, Ms. Grant.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Well, let me assure all of you, Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and all of the hags over at the Daily Planet are working day and night to get this exclusive.<eos> We need to get it first.<eos> I want a sit down with Supergirl. A girl to girl. And I want it by, um, the end of the week.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Not you, Kara.<eos> Do you really think that I don't know what's going on with you?<eos> You do?
It's the questions the DSD wants to ask you.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> That man, the agent isn't going to leave you alone.<eos> I wanted you to have it so you could see there's nothing to be scared of.<eos> I'm scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of what?<eos> You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.<eos> She didn't?
I'm seeing someone.<eos> What?<eos> Um, I've been... Seeing someone.<eos> Who?<eos> Patti Levin.<eos> She ran the Guilty Remnant in Mapleton.<eos> But she's dead.<eos> It started happening right after we found Lily when you moved in.<eos> I thought she'd go away when we came here.<eos> She didn't.
Yeah, I do have to say this.<eos> My family is the reason that I left the program in the first place.<eos> Started thinking more about them than the mission, so I-I left.<eos> President asked me to come back, so I came back.<eos> But what the hell? If you can't save the people you love, what's the point, right?<eos> I don't blame you for saving your family, Malcolm.<eos> I never would.<eos> I blame you for lying to me about the program,<eos> Ray, and everything that I believe in.<eos> Ah, John... what the hell did you do to me?
We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess.<eos> No secrets.<eos> No sins.<eos> As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person.<eos> Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets.<eos> I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
Well, in the end you were right.<eos> And think of all the girls who were saved.<eos> Yeah. A website for serial killers.<eos> Who knew?<eos> You know, a few weeks before my sister died, we went to Virginia Beach for her birthday, just the two of us, and we were laying there and I asked her what she was thinking.<eos> And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would.<eos> You know? Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
Thank you. Sit. Shh.<eos> Whoever set you up knew what they were doing.<eos> These transactions are impossible to trace.<eos> We can't prove that you weren't involved.<eos> We can account for every move you made on the Middle East desk.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Joe, I think we could build a case for lack of probable cause.<eos> I confessed.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I did it.
- Oh, it's worse.<eos> How do you have one of the Amphorae?<eos> Where did Rhais get it?<eos> You move again, and I'll open it!<eos> You're an eight-ball.<eos> No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
What kind of intel?<eos> Classified.<eos> I should have said no, but I get the distinct impression that my position in this clinical trial is contingent on doing him favors.<eos> So, do them. I mean, don't people leak information all the time?<eos> You hear what I said?<eos> He's leveraging my health, my life.<eos> Harold, you're a decent man.<eos> The man I fell in love with, and now you're asked to do something indecent.<eos> But if you are telling me that your life depends on whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants, you know my opinion.<eos> I do.
It said good-bye.<eos> Good-bye, Mr. Lester.<eos> Now, your fellow officer stated that Mr. Rickter was a danger to himself and others.<eos> Was that your observation, too?<eos> Officer Tannerman?<eos> Um...<eos> I was not in a position to make any observation.<eos> But you saw Mr. Rickter being brought in to Homan Square?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> You didn't?
Just like Freeman.<eos> These killings could have a ritualistic component.<eos> We found three more bodies where Connor was being held captive.<eos> Two of them had connections to Rockwell, one we're still waiting on.<eos> Listen to me, Alex, if you run, they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You need to talk to them now.<eos> Rockwell?<eos> He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
Sad...<eos> Gerald Giraffe feels sad.<eos> The metadata indicates that Detective Prima deleted the e-mail from the Canadian authorities, but he couldn't have.<eos> He was testifying on the stand at the time.<eos> Okay...<eos> So, um, then I thought it was maybe Geneva Pine, but actually she was out of town at a prosecutors convention.<eos> Hey, Dora, you're about to spill juice on the couch.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, what are you trying to say?<eos> Um, I'm saying from what I could ascertain, Detective Prima never deleted the e-mail.<eos> Uh, no one did.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Landau.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> - And you must be...<eos> - Marissa.<eos> Alicia's executive assistant.<eos> So very nice to meet you.<eos> Well, come on in!<eos> Have a seat, have some popcorn, the official snack food of the State of Illinois.<eos> I didn't know we had an official snack food.<eos> We do!
You think Patrick's dead already?<eos> You think he just-- he left and never came home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is she?<eos> Susan.<eos> She's your friend.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - I do.
That's your job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Now, you go ahead and notify away.<eos> What?<eos> My son, he saw a light in the DZ up on the hillside.<eos> There's nothing alive out there.<eos> He didn't see anything.<eos> We, uh-- we went house to house, block by block.<eos> I know.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - Already did.
Go on.<eos> There was a man shot like the others, like the rest, but he-- he wasn't sick.<eos> And there were others like that.<eos> When I was young, these men-- these men were from the government.<eos> They came to our town and they took some people away.<eos> And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
So do I.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> No food or drink will be consumed until we know it's safe.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe she was poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our King, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> Do I believe our enemies would dare poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
After the shooting, I only hear from him when he needs food or supplies.<eos> Your time's up.<eos> You want your friend to survive this?<eos> Maybe even get his life back?<eos> Then you'll look into my eyes, and you'll see I'm the only person who can help him.<eos> Please. Where is he?<eos> You got anything to tie him with?<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> How do we kill him?<eos> We don't.
I will do everything in my power to protect you.<eos> Okay, my new lawyer, I trust you.<eos> But I won't agree to anything until I speak to Sophia in person.<eos> My cell number's on the back.<eos> Sophia and I will meet you wherever you want.<eos> There are some things that I have to take care of first.<eos> I will text you.<eos> Good-bye, Mr. Decker.<eos> How do I know you're not trying to kill him?<eos> You don't.
And your family, this little girl that you love, they're safe.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?<eos> It means everything to me.<eos> I'm alive. I'm safe.<eos> But my little girl, she needs to know that I'm alive. At least that.<eos> I can't stay dead forever.<eos> So that's it.<eos> What more is there?<eos> Do I really have to say it?<eos> No, you don't.
Arnold works at the Post Office.<eos> No, he works in a surveillance room inside the Nippon Building listening to people's calls.<eos> I got in there last night, and I saw him.<eos> - Did he see you?<eos> - No.<eos> Are they making him do it?<eos> No. If anything, it looked like he was in charge.<eos> Oh, my God. He's been lying to all of us.<eos> If he's working for them, you have to be even more careful, Jules.<eos> We both do.
I understand.<eos> Actually, i don't. I don't understand.<eos> If you have a chance to save your child, Even a small one, you take it.<eos> So, this is about something more than that.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe god wanted us to know That she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that...<eos> We have to let her go. I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
We're so pleased to see you.<eos> I want to hear all about Hillcroft.<eos> Why did you first get involved?<eos> Naturally I'd be happy to take as much of the credit as possible, but it was really Mrs Harding's idea.<eos> What was it that drew you to the work they were doing?<eos> Forgive me, but have we met?<eos> Er, I don't think we've met exactly.<eos> Tell us more about Hillcroft.<eos> You see, I never had any higher education and so --<eos> Who did?
Yeah, I'm sure I did.<eos> I assist Dr. Nash both here and at County.<eos> I'm just doing a study on supratentoral coma, and I was interested in what happened during the surgery.<eos> Do you remember it?<eos> We do so many, but...<eos> Yeah, I do remember her's.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> It's just that I've been led to believe that Jane may have flatlined on the table.<eos> But when I checked the records, there's no evidence of that.<eos> Because she didn't.
Nothing.<eos> There is no "next."<eos> And I'm not gonna let them paw through his entire life to find something that doesn't exist.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Ethan was a scientist.<eos> Don't you think he would want us to keep looking if it led to a new discovery?<eos> But that's not for anyone to say...<eos> Not you or me or Ivan Turing.<eos> Look, Julie, I understand how hard...<eos> No, you don't.
What's wrong?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> It's... it's fine. I, um...<eos> I came to apologize.<eos> I've been acting a little crazy over this whole Turing thing.<eos> Len, there is nothing...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I - I talked to him today.<eos> He told me what's going on.<eos> He did?
Okay.<eos> Do you want to tell me the whole story, or should I just stand here and go crazy?<eos> Turing asked me to investigate life after death.<eos> I'm looking for scientific proof of what happens when we die.<eos> Really?<eos> And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
I wanted to talk to you about Ivan.<eos> He's been acting strange lately.<eos> Strange? In... in what way?<eos> I think he's hiding something.<eos> What's going on, Janel?<eos> There's nothing going on.<eos> Business as usual.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you adore my brother.<eos> We both do.
I can't find a single Jason Harper in pharmaceuticals.<eos> First you have to write it all down, okay?<eos> Including the rape part?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> The rape is very important.<eos> Lieutenant Tao, tell the owners that we want the entire history of apartment 701 for the past three years.<eos> Murder and rape.<eos> I think I'll have to cancel my dinner.<eos> Good news, everybody.<eos> The lieutenant did great!
All right?<eos> And, Louie, I am very much looking forward to last night's dinner.<eos> Oh, and, just for fun, I made sure that we will have a table outside on the terrace with a view of the city, you know, just in case our meal turns out to be, um, memorable... in some way.<eos> Patrice...<eos> You think you're ready for this... Dinner?<eos> I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.

Dinner?<eos> I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.<eos> I... do.
I've thought it over, and I'll do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> Turn evidence against bishop.<eos> What evidence, cary?<eos> I'll only do it if I have your guarantee You'll drop the charges against kalinda and diane.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me a day to get some ducks in a row,<eos> Odd how things turn out.<eos> A month ago, no one wanted to turn on bishop.<eos> Now everybody does.
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> Danny, what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, this is my partner, Steve McGarrett.<eos> Steve, this is my lovely ex-wife, Rachel.<eos> You didn't have to come here.<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, the cops investigated, and they found Pelham's DNA in her apartment, but that was it, so, all they had him on was a B and E.<eos> A month after he makes bail, they found Leddy's body.<eos> Then they found two more.<eos> Trace evidence on one linked to Pelham.<eos> So cops had him dead to rights, he splits town, been hiding out here ever since.<eos> Kept out of trouble.<eos> Even got himself a job as a dog-walker.<eos> That's smart-- low profile, cash business.<eos> All right, how'd you figure out that Pelham was on Oahu? Uh...<eos> I didn't.
This isn't over!<eos> All right, Brick.<eos> This is important.<eos> Sports is a great teacher of life.<eos> It teaches you that there's winners and there's losers.<eos> And it's very clear... if you don't win, you're a loser.<eos> Your mom will tell you it's how you play the game.<eos> She's wrong.<eos> Got it.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Nowhere.<eos> It's a nice day out.<eos> I thought it would be nice to drive around for a bit.<eos> What's that move called again?<eos> A lay-up.<eos> And that's worth two points, right?<eos> Yes, always worth two points, unless you're beyond the three-point line.<eos> And where is that?<eos> You really want to know this stuff?<eos> Yeah. I really do.
No one is holding anyone at bow-and-arrow point.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - Poor guy.<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> He gets like this.<eos> What kind of guy gets good at darts to impress girls?<eos> Worked with you.<eos> Robert was a great darts player.<eos> I practiced all the time so someday I could beat him.<eos> I never did.
He's a married man.<eos> I was trying to be honorable.<eos> Well, as honorable as one can be while sneaking around and having sex with a married man.<eos> But these things are always a little... sticky.<eos> Should I spell "fellatio" for you?<eos> I'll speak with Mr. Holloway.<eos> As always, I appreciate your time.<eos> Pryce... I answered all of your questions - twice.<eos> But you never answered mine.<eos> No. I didn't.
You'll always be the someday I want.<eos> But I have to go back and you have to stay.<eos> It'll be easier this way.<eos> The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States.<eos> And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday.<eos> But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
I've talked to you before... Back there.<eos> How is it that you're able to be here?<eos> Do you go back and forth between life and death?<eos> There are... Several of us...<eos> Who have guided people to the other side.<eos> That's why I visited dying patients...<eos> To help them pass.<eos> So you lied to me.<eos> You said you didn't have all the answers.<eos> I don't.
You've had them all these years?<eos> Billy, I need you there now.<eos> - Ethan... - You're gonna pay for this.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing.<eos> I'm doing what I set out to do.<eos> I'm solving this murder.<eos> Raquel was my friend and you killed her!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, but I do.
Some ideas need a larger ecosystem.<eos> Give a buffalo a million acres, it thrives.<eos> Stick it on a desert island, in four generations,<eos> - it's the size of a poodle.<eos> - That's a charming anecdote, but I work for a living, so can we move this along, please?<eos> - We violated no copyrights.<eos> - We own proprietary algorithms...<eos> You were making it up as you went, at least admit it.<eos> - Connecting subscribers in discreet<eos> - The Source does a version of that... - Delphi, CompuServe.
Do us a favor, McGee, dig with headphones.<eos> Luke carries an MP3 player, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just saying, Gibbs, in the morning, let's see if he has any songs like these.<eos> It could mean something.<eos> Well, she seemed friendly.<eos> Anything?<eos> Uh, her name is Amber.<eos> She's a criminal justice major, she has daddy issues, and she wanted to discuss my search-and-seizure techniques.<eos> She did not.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.<eos> In five minutes, Paul Jenks is gonna sign a deal.<eos> If you'll excuse me for just a minute.<eos> Are you here to thank me? Here to arrest you.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in.<eos> I know, Sasha. About the port, the trucks, the shipping company.<eos> I'm a businesswoman. Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
Wasn't personal, you know.<eos> Pick... up... your gun.<eos> Now! Pick it up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Lauren, please.<eos> Can I get an N-A-R-C?<eos> He's not the man he seems to be!<eos> - He's a narc! - Narc!<eos> - He's a narc! - Yeah, he's a narc.<eos> Okay, now that everyone's gone, I just want to say that I am so, so sorry.<eos> It was just a stupid revenge plot that got totally out of hand.<eos> You tried to roofie me.<eos> I was jealous that you slept with Zita.<eos> I didn't.
He's not the man he seems to be!<eos> - He's a narc! - Narc!<eos> - He's a narc! - Yeah, he's a narc.<eos> Okay, now that everyone's gone, I just want to say that I am so, so sorry.<eos> It was just a stupid revenge plot that got totally out of hand.<eos> You tried to roofie me.<eos> I was jealous that you slept with Zita.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I just said that because you slept with Felix.<eos> - I didn't.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars.." We know who it is.<eos> We have a name.<eos> It's Andrew, babe.<eos> Hey, there's another girl down here.<eos> I'm Sara Harvey.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.

Because that's how it works.<eos> I'm under every stone that somebody turns over.<eos> I make people into people that they never were.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> 'I saw you and Em and Aria and Hanna in that place' 'that sick place, and I knew' I was why you were there.<eos> It always comes down to me.<eos> And everyone would be fine without me.<eos> God, Ali, no, it's not like that.<eos> You think it yourself.<eos> No, I don't.
It always comes down to me.<eos> And everyone would be fine without me.<eos> God, Ali, no, it's not like that.<eos> You think it yourself.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> 'You've reached Spencer.<eos> Leave a..'<eos> Dr. Sullivan. I'm so glad to see you here.<eos> I called, did your mother tell you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she did.
And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself.<eos> I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
You're talking about Stagg and Sepulveda.<eos> - Oh, you lived there too? - Yeah.<eos> I did eight months.<eos> I was running crank for the Mongols.<eos> Bureau sold that apartment as "next door to a sex party."<eos> Ah. Yeah, that's the spot, man.<eos> I tell you, after a long day in the field, the last thing you need is to hear some bimbo screaming, "Harder," through the walls, you know?<eos> Well, small world.<eos> You know, Colby, I actually do have a room opening up here.<eos> No, you don't.
- 'Wait, wait.'<eos> When we went back inside after A locked us out do you remember a tiled room?<eos> - 'It was right next to the.... '<eos> - Spencer, I do not wanna....<eos> Aria, please, just help me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> It-it is taking all that I have to forget that place.<eos> 'It is bad enough I can't even walk by the photo lab.... '<eos> What did you do with that hair dye?
Seriously?<eos> Well, there were a few people who didn't say, "Yay", right away but I took advantage of the silence.<eos> I really believe you can make a difference with these kids.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Uh, you remember Lorenzo?<eos> - Hello. Is this your idea of a replacement?<eos> 'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you.<eos> - He did.
What's takin' Hanna so long?<eos> I don't know, she probably has to drag Mona here on a leash.<eos> Oh, Spencer, we saw A jump off a building.<eos> A set up an underground bunker with more spy equipment than the CIA.<eos> I mean, seriously, in your heart do you believe that Lesli Stone could...<eos> People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
I promise it's not as complicated as I just made it sound.<eos> These days everyone wants a responsive design that adjusts itself to different screens.<eos> So the photo of... Kimye will look the same on your phone, your smart pad, and your computer.<eos> What's Kimye?<eos> Kanye and Kim?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You wouldn't, uh... You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
And I-I saw that you needed a recommendation so I wrote you one.<eos> Which I know is-is very presumptuous and if you want somebody else to write it...<eos> No.<eos> No, I mean...<eos> Who knows me better than you do?<eos> Wow. And you definitely used your creative writing skills.<eos> When... When did I have a solo exhibit at The Brew?<eos> I might have embellished slightly.<eos> But I mean, I do have your self-portrait hangin' above my desk.<eos> I did.
Were you in an accident?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. You don't know what?<eos> If it happened on purpose.<eos> I-I turned onto that street behind the school and I felt like I was being followed.<eos> By who?<eos> There was this dark car, it was going real slow.<eos> Did the car hit you?<eos> It suddenly sped up, and... the side mirror smashed into my elbow and... I-I have to clean this up before your mom sees it.<eos> No, you don't.
Work?<eos> Sara's got a job?<eos> That's great.<eos> God, if I went through what she did, I don't think I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to...<eos> We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
You need a sandwich.<eos> Would it help if I were there?<eos> - Where?<eos> - At Spencer's.<eos> The-the barn prom.<eos> I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
Yeah.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Just smile.<eos> ♪ Pretty pretty pretty ♪ Oh, no, you're not done.<eos> I want some on my phone.<eos> ♪ I'd like to know your name... ♪ Toby, can you just call someone at the station?<eos> Hanna, when I turned in my badge I got frostbite.<eos> I can't call in any favors right now.<eos> Okay, if Caleb has some crazy plan and you know about it...<eos> - I don't.
That couldn't have gone over too well.<eos> I can scratch off number fifteen off my list.<eos> "She would regret never getting"...<eos> April Carver got fired from a job?<eos> I'm trying something new.<eos> I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.
What's going on?<eos> You've been set up.<eos> The Cabal's been asking about you, Lizzy.<eos> They know who your mother was.<eos> You've been set up.<eos> You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
I mean, come on, it's gonna be huge.<eos> Yeah, no, about that, I-I can't do it, buddy. You haven't paid back the last eight outstanding loans.<eos> Loans?<eos> Loans. Those were equity investments.<eos> Right, partner?<eos> Come on, whatever happened to "if we're not failing, we're not trying," huh?<eos> Yeah, I know, that sounds fantastic. I just, I can't... I can't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Equity's only gonna get more expensive. You're gonna regret this.<eos> I already do.
Who?<eos> Used to work security for him.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> All right, clear!<eos> Wait!<eos> You better start knowing, otherwise we're gonna jump-start your memory for you.<eos> Arkady paid me to get some information from an inmate.<eos> Patrick Berkeley.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I didn't.
Gouda day, little guy. Goddamn it, she's good.<eos> So... yeah. Uh... I have a confession to make:<eos> I have been drinking all day.<eos> But this is me apologizing to you all...<eos> I-Is the mouse in that box? Shh.<eos> Rocket ship to Heaven.<eos> How did we barely even hang today? I'm about to start my annual Arliss re-watch.<eos> You in? I'll FaceTime you.<eos> I don't think your friends like me very much.<eos> What? ! Of course they do.
- Well, I've thought of that.<eos> I'll do lunch for Mr Dawes, too.<eos> You could ask Mr Mason to join you on the day.<eos> He'd enjoy that.<eos> Don't bother him, not when he's got so much work to do.<eos> I'll tell him as soon as we have a date.<eos> See if he'd like to look in.<eos> I don't understand why you can't just leave him alone.<eos> - Daisy, that's not very gracious.<eos> - Well, I don't!
He will be teaching you history and English literature.<eos> - Make him welcome, please.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to it.<eos> This term we will explore the years between the Civil War of 1642 and... 1642 and the Glorious Revolution... of 1688.<eos> Almost half a century of change and social progress.<eos> I hope you will find it as exciting as I do.<eos> Things have changed for you now.<eos> - You must know that you're quite free if you want to be.<eos> - I don't.
- Are you all right, Mr Barrow? - Of course.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> - Going away?<eos> - Do you care?<eos> Look, I wasn't to know you hadn't told him. It never occurred to me --<eos> Just shut up!<eos> I don't know what's happened.<eos> Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa, or maybe it's just the same old Mary who wants her cake and ha'penny!<eos> - I never meant to --<eos> - Yes, you did!
Now, I checked with my boy at the Pentagon, and there's only a handful of guys with that service history who match the guy you said you saw.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you for this, Esposito.<eos> This is great.<eos> So, he will be in here somewhere.<eos> Yeah, but he's not.<eos> None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up.<eos> It still doesn't.
- Did you guys see that?<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> Sort of impossible not to.<eos> Okay, question.<eos> Do you think Meredith is into me?<eos> Do we think?<eos> Detective.<eos> Damn.<eos> What you've been through, you don't have to explain anything.<eos> Of course, I do.
But I would like to get to know you better.<eos> Why don't we start by doing some lines together?<eos> Oh, trust me, you won't need anything in a few minutes.<eos> - Making friends?<eos> - He's great.<eos> Yeah, she's about to get real friendly.<eos> You drug her?<eos> Not drug her, drug her.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
You got a name?<eos> I don't know, but I was surprised Zach could score a woman looking like that.<eos> Why?<eos> Zach was a good-looking kid.<eos> Yeah, but he was broke.<eos> She was loaded.<eos> The kind of girl that didn't have to worry where her next trip to Ibiza was coming from.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> So, this mystery girlfriend, she paid for the coke?<eos> No, Zach did. With this.
That's why I feel like I can't tell you anything, because no matter what I'm going through, you're going through something worse. So what?<eos> You can still tell me your problems.<eos> Why?<eos> So you can try to fix me, like you always do.<eos> I don't try to fix you. Yeah, you do.<eos> When dad died, you moved back home to take care of us.<eos> When I started getting into trouble after that, you helped mom find Charton.<eos> When mom pulled me out of honor, you asked me to be your maid of honor.<eos> I thought you'd like that.<eos> I do, but...
You said, "Get rid of it," and it's not in the game.<eos> So how did Patrick Wildenborg come across it?<eos> Well, it's hidden in the code, so he hacked it.<eos> So it's in the code.<eos> Forgive me, the game is made up of code, isn't it, on the disk?<eos> Yes.<eos> So does it not therefore follow that if it's in the code it's in the game?<eos> Well, no, it doesn't, it's a little more complicated than that, actually.<eos> The scene is in the code, but the players can't access it.<eos> But Wildenborg did.
I've been looking all over for you.<eos> You know, you could have made it a little easier on me, all right?<eos> I am on crutches.<eos> So I don't...<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What do you mean, you're not gay?<eos> Do you not like me?<eos> No, of course I like you.<eos> Do you not like me like that?<eos> No, I do.
I do too, as long as you're there.<eos> Are you sure we can afford it?<eos> We'll make sure it's a priority.<eos> Deal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Oh, I think our bathroom is leaking again.<eos> I thought the plumber took care of that.<eos> He did.
(OK.)<eos> (Go on.)<eos> Mum!<eos> Mum! Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Oh, my God, I am so glad you persuaded him. This is so cool!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why do people like these places?<eos> Heh. They don't. Not all.
Quinn, close the door and put the gun away.<eos> They're reporters, not assassins.<eos> Here, sit down. I'm sorry.<eos> This place is a mess.<eos> What do you need? Oh, can I get you something to drink?<eos> I have water, I have tea, I have wine.<eos> Liv, tell me how to help.<eos> What can I do?<eos> What do we have?<eos> - What do we...
That briefing today was magic.<eos> He doesn't know it. He can't appreciate it.<eos> But you may have single-handedly saved his presidency.<eos> He doesn't care about his presidency, Cyrus. He only cares about Liv.<eos> What does Liv want him to say?<eos> What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know. She's gone.<eos> She ran away. - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!
She spent four years terrorizing this community.<eos> To redeem a father who is still recovering<eos> - from the effects of being wrongly convicted.<eos> - That does...<eos> Enough! Nobody here is being paid by the word.<eos> Ms. Clarke, my thoughts.<eos> I will grant bail, but I do so with great concern and under the strictest of conditions.<eos> If I hear even a rumor that my conditions for release have been violated, I will have you locked up so fast your inscrutable little head will spin.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do, Your Honor.
- We have a medical emergency.<eos> He's resting at home.<eos> By the time I got to the E.R., he was awake.<eos> He was stable.<eos> It was like nothing happened.<eos> They're running more tests, and no results yet.<eos> So they sent David home.<eos> He's doing okay, right?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Don't worry.<eos> No one saw me, not even you.<eos> You were at your own funeral?<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> Why must you insist on making it so difficult? !<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> But I wanted to see my children for one last time.<eos> But apparently, they didn't have the same desire.<eos> - Oh, Victoria.<eos> - Louise did.
I won't.<eos> Do it.<eos> I'm gonna take care of the bitch Margaux paid to do this.<eos> Nolan, you can't. She's dangerous.<eos> So am I.<eos> I trained for four years with the most dangerous sensei I know.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> We still have to find Victoria.<eos> We don't know where she's hiding.<eos> I do. No, no.
Okay, I'll bite.<eos> What does Buddhism have to do with erectile dysfunction?<eos> If I'm right, Watson, everything we want it to.<eos> Mrs. Parker, do you understand your rights as they've been read to you?<eos> Yes. What I understand is that you're desperate.<eos> Griff and I leave for our trip tonight.<eos> You want to try to delay us.<eos> It's funny you should mention Griff.<eos> He's the reason we're here. He gave you up this morning.<eos> Sure, he did.
I was gonna be there to watch you fall.<eos> Why do you keep fighting it, huh?<eos> Why put yourself through this?<eos> We both know it's just a matter of time, so why not just cut to the chase?<eos> You're gonna tell me where Alfredo is.<eos> Why?<eos> Why, 'cause he's your buddy now, huh?<eos> He's your pal?<eos> No, because he has... nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he does, Sherlock.
_<eos> _ _<eos> I'm going to count silently in my head to five.<eos> Can I, um... can I use your computer?<eos> He was a terrorist.<eos> - The Department of Defense said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> They called him a terrorist in order to kill him.<eos> SOC controls the Department of Defense?<eos> Politicians do.
What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Made you cinnamon rolls.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, it's just Lucy.<eos> You know, her fiancé was in Mom's unit?<eos> She's coming over for lunch today.<eos> Do I have to come?<eos> Of course not. Only if you want to.<eos> Good. I don't.
So it would appear.<eos> My sister? Her kids?<eos> No, my sister. Her kids.<eos> We found out too late, Mr. Frink.<eos> But you are free to go.<eos> No, no, no. I- - I'm free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough. And I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Who named him that?<eos> Jimmy Olsen.<eos> So. Who is this guy really?<eos> HANK: Unknown.<eos> He remains at large after a string of very public fights with your cousin.<eos> Neither of them ever came out on top.<eos> And no one knows why he's so obsessed with killing Superman.<eos> what's the plan?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> We don't.
No. Could you have another one?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Painkillers?<eos> Morphine at the hospital brought on visions before.<eos> That was totally unpredictable.<eos> Unless you guys have a bunch of LSD lying around, I...<eos> Figure it out. We need answers.<eos> Chief, a handful of officers were dispatched to the edge of the town to deal with a situation.<eos> Do any of the officers know about the troubles?<eos> No. Not many do.
Three days ago, a bearded man with a yellow bandanna walked out of a dark boiler room.<eos> Was that you?<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I don't think luck had anything to do with it.<eos> What?<eos> You think this is my trouble? No way.<eos> No, you're trying to undermine me to save Nathan.<eos> No one else survived. No one.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
Would you be able to get my sweater out of the car?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Oh, don't be surprised if when you come back, you have a few grandkids.<eos> Arla wants three.<eos> I love you, James.<eos> Lucy, no.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I have to. You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
There must be something we can do.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> Changing the past with something as big as this, it could destroy us all.<eos> It almost did when you tried to kill our son.<eos> - No. - But now I know that a Colton makes Thinnies, and I can take that information to my world, and maybe I can save Haven for good.<eos> But he's my son.<eos> He's your son.<eos> We can't save him.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He already did.
It changed everything.<eos> So you want to tell me who the hell you are?<eos> Saul Goodwin.<eos> Saul, the kid whose stuff I stole in elementary school.<eos> You were really into photography.<eos> Way to hold a grudge, buddy.<eos> I don't remember you from grade school.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Because you don't remember Haven.<eos> No, I don't.
Come on, Gretl, up.<eos> I'm Caroline Koch.<eos> I'm Dr. Sacani.<eos> This is Divya.<eos> You said it was an emergency?<eos> My tongue died.<eos> Oh, uh, is it feeling numb or painful?<eos> So much worse than that.<eos> And the scariest thing is I know why it happened.<eos> Oh, you do?
Hold on a second. Let's say<eos> I did ask you to marry me.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> But if I did.<eos> Would you have said yes?<eos> That's like asking, if a chicken laid an egg in the forest, would you hear it?<eos> I guess it was a good thing I didn't ruin your life by offering to love and cherish you till death do us part.<eos> What are you getting so mad about?<eos> You didn't want to marry me, either.<eos> No, I did.
A very difficult choice.<eos> No.<eos> You killed James, my son.<eos> I had to.<eos> That's how much I love you.<eos> If I hadn't killed him, Lucy would have, and then all of Mara's work, your work, would've been undone.<eos> Worse than that, the Barn would've sent you home, and I would've lost you forever.<eos> Do you think that's an excuse?<eos> Excuses are for people who regret what they've done.<eos> I don't, because everything I did, I did for you.
Rock, paper, scissors.<eos> Stick with the paper, kid.<eos> They never see it coming.<eos> Got a few more security cameras going.<eos> Perimeter looks good.<eos> I think we might need to talk about something. Ah.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Croatoan's offer has to be a little... tempting.<eos> You're asking me if I want all this to be over, live behind some white picket fence, adopt a shelter dog?<eos> Of course I do.
This isn't you.<eos> Oh, this is me, just with improvements.<eos> The Duke I know stands up to bullies like Croatoan.<eos> You don't want to hurt Vickie.<eos> I should've killed you when you were a statue.<eos> Go.<eos> - The Aether core.<eos> - Got it.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Why are you doing this?<eos> No-one ever does nice shit for me, eh?<eos> It's what I do. Hm?<eos> So, Bea, yeah, I've been a cop for a while now and I've seen a lot of domestic violence, and I can understand why a woman like you would kill her husband.<eos> I didn't kill my husband.<eos> Well, you tried to once.<eos> Yeah, those charges were dropped.<eos> But now your husband really is dead, and I want to know why.<eos> Don't you want to know why?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know if I can.<eos> I'm too weak and vulnerable to speak for myself.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I hate it too.<eos> But I'm dealing with it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> No, you don't.
I know that disabled people are valuable and they have the right to exist.<eos> That doesn't mean that I'm the guy to raise one of them.<eos> This will ruin my life.<eos> It will change your life.<eos> But it doesn't mean that it will ruin it.<eos> I think it would expand it.<eos> This is not helping.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And I have to be able to tell you this.<eos> No, you don't!
No.<eos> I was recommending caution.<eos> Seniority doesn't make her immune to mistakes.<eos> So, keep your mouth shut and check on the patient later.<eos> - There's a hierarchy.<eos> - I know that, Patrick.<eos> Besides, she's been booking solid O.R. days all month.<eos> You're two days back from mat leave.<eos> You ask me...<eos> - I didn't.
Dr. Reid is saving this patient.<eos> Whatever you've got to say, you can say it outside of this O.R.<eos> Let's get back to work.<eos> Natalie, what are you doing?<eos> I, uh, have to find my purse.<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> You're in no shape to leave.<eos> You could have died today.<eos> Dr. Lin, I thank you for everything that you tried to do for me.<eos> I really do.
He overruled her.<eos> They had a syringe to your throat and she wouldn't move an inch.<eos> We don't negotiate with prisoners. You know the policy.<eos> OK.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> I'm sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.<eos> Why did you say no?<eos> Why was the offer even made?<eos> I mean, Ferguson doesn't want me there.<eos> Yes, she does.
Don't you start on me.<eos> You are like a broken record. Round and...<eos> "Oh, lagger. Bloody hell, you've stolen me brew, ya lagger.<eos> Get my hands off Franky!" I didn't steal your friggin' brew.<eos> You've been shoving it under my pillow.<eos> I have not...<eos> No and you have already bashed my scone in for lagging, so we are even, right?<eos> So you can shut up, ya fat arse baby.<eos> I don't have a fat arse.<eos> You do.
- The defense would like...<eos> - of the earlier trial.<eos> - the transcripts. If I could finish...<eos> Your Honor, this is a travesty.<eos> The defense attorney is arguing double jeopardy, but Mr. Tatro is not being accused<eos> - of the same crime.<eos> - Your Honor, if I could speak.<eos> In 2009 we needed to prove that Mr. Tatro had a specific intent to kill Mr. Jeffrey Garrix.<eos> - And they failed.<eos> They did not...
We do not hold the recent election scandal against Alicia Florrick at all.<eos> Of course, that's why you brought it up, so it won't be held against her.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Florrick, you are more than welcome to join the party.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Now, pretrial motions... what do you have?<eos> Argue for the inclusion of the transcript now.<eos> Your Honor, the defense would like the transcripts to be...<eos> We ask that the record of the earlier trial be excluded from the records as prejudicial, Your Honor.<eos> The prosecution wants to exclude this transcript for...<eos> Yes, we do.
Do you have reason to disbelieve her testimony from the first trial?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was high.<eos> Objection.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> On the... give me a sec.<eos> Grounds?<eos> Hearsay?<eos> Mr. Cain, do you have firsthand knowledge that Lexie Bromwich was using drugs on the day in question?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm in class right now or sleeping it off.<eos> Zach. Hi. It's Mom.<eos> We haven't talked in a while.<eos> Cary.<eos> You could have sent someone.<eos> Yes, I could have.<eos> You had all this stuff, and you never showed it to me?<eos> I did try to show you, but you wanted to take the case in another direction.<eos> - You didn't try to show me.<eos> - I did.
We know that Brett was in that parking lot.<eos> - He told us so.<eos> - Yes, but we're not putting him on the stand, so we're not suborning perjury.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, but we are allowing Dakota's testimony to be entered into the record, a testimony we know is false.<eos> - We have to tell the judge.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen, Amber.<eos> When we argued for the transcript to be admitted, we didn't know it was false.<eos> Yes, but we do now.
- Your Honor...<eos> - No, Matan.<eos> You had your shot in 2009.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Mr. Tatro, your case has been dismissed with prejudice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so gthis worked out, Brett.<eos> I want to learn from you.<eos> No, you don't.
All those years that I believed our child was dead,<eos> Tituba knew that he was being raised in the woods by the Elders.<eos> She kept it a secret until that night we were to meet under the moon and leave Salem forever.<eos> But before I could come to you,<eos> Tituba brought our little boy to me.<eos> I couldn't abandon him yet again.<eos> I had to stay with our son.<eos> I have a son.<eos> We have a son.<eos> We do.
No, you can't do that.<eos> I just killed a man.<eos> You just killed a dirty cop who started a gang war.<eos> We have to tell someone. I... - Why?<eos> - Gretchen.<eos> Any gang member in town could have came and done this and ran off.<eos> And nobody even knows you're here!<eos> - Gretchen, I have...<eos> You get arrested for killing a cop, and you go to jail and hope they sort out what happened here.<eos> And maybe they do. Maybe they don't.
I have a lot to be grateful for. Your support, for one thing, Governor.<eos> Mr Fletcher, please. Let's dispense with the false platitudes.<eos> I think we both know why you are here.<eos> I have always suspected that your brain injury wasn't as debilitating as you made out.<eos> Uh, I... I'm not... I mean, I don't...<eos> Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh. Just stop!<eos> Just stop it with the... with the inarticulation and the slack jaw and the Neanderthal gait and the...<eos> I mean, did you really think that you could unsettle me by dredging up the past, did you?<eos> I mean, is this the best you can do?<eos> Governor, I... I don't...
Come on. Where is this clown?<eos> Ticktock, Danny Reagan.<eos> We're gonna call an audible.<eos> All units, get ready to move in.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We're gonna take 'em. On my orders we move.<eos> What do you think you're doing, Danny?<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> You have absolutely no grounds to arrest them.<eos> Sure, I do.
Get on the ground!<eos> Put your hands where I can see them right now!<eos> Don't move! On the ground! Get on the ground right now!<eos> Now! Don't move!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Get down.<eos> Get on the ground. On the ground.<eos> Where's your boss tonight, tough guy?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And all of them stuck.<eos> See, he didn't just make good collars.<eos> What'd he do?<eos> He tied them up in neat little bows.<eos> It's time you learned how to gift wrap.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Old friend can't come by to check up on you?<eos> I told you, I don't got nothing to say to you.<eos> I got nothing to say to you either.<eos> Somebody else does.
Seeing you in here like this? !<eos> Calm down.<eos> No, no, Curtis, I can't go on like this, not another minute.<eos> I'm sorry, son, but if you choose to spend the rest of your life in here, then I have nothing to live for!<eos> We good?<eos> You're good.<eos> I'll get the video equipment.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> I thought you had that mother on 24-hour protection.<eos> We do.
We good?<eos> You're good.<eos> I'll get the video equipment.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> I thought you had that mother on 24-hour protection.<eos> We do.<eos> Then how did she get banged up like that?<eos> Detail must have slipped away for a minute.<eos> Do not tell me you willfully allowed that woman to be beaten by a known gang member.<eos> I didn't.
I saw you killing him with my eyes.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I never wanted to cause such ruckus.<eos> I was going meet you privately outside.<eos> But I noticed that you were going to cover up this case.<eos> So I came in person like this.<eos> Kim Jin-kyu.<eos> Yes?<eos> Is this because of your dad?<eos> Anyang, Jinchun, Gwangmyung, you did it.
Well, what are we supposed to do?<eos> I mean, the two of them?<eos> Plus alcohol?<eos> On a boat?<eos> Did you not see The Poseidon Adventure?<eos> We're gonna be upside down and climbing up a Christmas tree before we know it.<eos> He was my best man.<eos> She's my sister.<eos> (sighs) Mol, you just don't understand the kind of position you're gonna put me in.<eos> I do.
Billy the child catcher?<eos> That's my guess.<eos> What reason did you give?<eos> Trade, of course.<eos> I said you was a surgeon.<eos> It'll cost you.<eos> How much?<eos> Ten guineas.<eos> - How do I know he'll deliver?<eos> - You don't.
You're meeting a friend.<eos> Mr Marlott, Mr Barkis.<eos> Delighted.<eos> But I'm not here to speak to Mr Barkis.<eos> Where's my man?<eos> - In the tunnels.<eos> - What?<eos> That's what I'm to tell you.<eos> Said he'd know.<eos> Do you?
That's not exactly true.<eos> Okay, what...<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing, it's just nothing.<eos> Tucson?<eos> Are you talking about tucson?<eos> Just saying that's where there are other people, phil.<eos> Carol, the only place I can't go is tucson.<eos> I mean, do you not remember me getting, like, tackled, Driven out into the desert and left there for dead?<eos> Yes, I do, I...
Fuck's sake.<eos> Come on, Toby, let's take the stairs.<eos> Guys, it's closed.<eos> Daiquiri for the screen siren.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Are you blind as well as stupid?<eos> Look in my ear and tell me what you see.<eos> Our party. Our rules!<eos> - Mind if we join you?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Okay, um, this isn't for a school paper, buddy.<eos> I write for an online vlog called Identity.<eos> And you don't get my programming here.<eos> But if you did, you'd know that I'm not just another middle-class white boy, okay?<eos> I lived on the street for two years.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Where? - Hollywood.<eos> Mostly west Hollywood and Hollywood, but I got around.<eos> Where did you get your hookup?<eos> Well, I didn't...
The cops.<eos> Did anyone tell you that?<eos> That's not really part of my story.<eos> I only want to know her name.<eos> Look, I had a bad drug problem back then, and the cops... they used it to screw me over, okay?<eos> I'm 10 months sober now, and I don't belong in here.<eos> So if you write about me...<eos> I'm not writing about you.<eos> You want to know about Alice or not?<eos> You do.
And when they do and people die, it's something that's hard for you to get over.<eos> I bet you went to see a malpractice lawyer at your firm, and I bet that lawyer told you something like<eos> "bad outcomes do not equal negligence."<eos> And I bet they told you that the best thing for you to do was to accept things and move on.<eos> But how?<eos> How do you move on when the doctor is still out there and the person that you loved... is dead?<eos> That sounds like the voice of experience.<eos> And it looks like it's having an effect.<eos> Maybe you could start by telling us what happened to your daughter.<eos> What did Dr. Henson do to her?
She's... I mean, sex, drugs, drinking, everything.<eos> But Stephanie...<eos> We couldn't get her to enjoy one little glass of champagne.<eos> Something happened that day.<eos> Something happened.<eos> But he... h-h-he didn't want to answer his phone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why... why... why wouldn't he answer his phone?<eos> I don't understand why my little girl...<eos> I don't...
Okay, we don't have to "Lady and the Tramp" it.<eos> Come on, live it up!<eos> So, tell me what's going on?<eos> Are you enjoying a hunk of Fisher pie?<eos> Oh, is this girl talk? Is that what this is?<eos> Look, I know he's Fisher-licious, but...<eos> Liam's been gone less than a week. The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
Yeah, but not for this you don't.<eos> Teach me.<eos> You're teaching her, so teach me.<eos> I have PhD's in bio-electrical engineering and neural systems.<eos> I mean, what more do you need?<eos> Stitching requires finesse.<eos> A feel.<eos> And you don't think I have that?<eos> No.<eos> But Camille does?
Make and model?<eos> A license plate number?<eos> We're past the point of no return.<eos> Um, black sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah, you walked right past Barbiero and the car on your way to meet us.<eos> I don't remember seeing them.<eos> I don't.
I've been dreaming about fucking my dad.<eos> Er, my dad fucking me, technically.<eos> That's quite an image to wake up from.<eos> How has communication been with your father?<eos> Whoa, I don't want to fuck my dad!<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean...<eos> Do I wanna fuck my dad?<eos> I don't know, Tom.<eos> Do you?
- Massive seizure, cerebral hemorrhage, death.<eos> SAUL: He may have vital information.<eos> Is there a procedure for waking him up?<eos> - What are the risks?<eos> Tell me what the target is.<eos> Tell me where the attack - is going to happen.<eos> - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please. NURSE:<eos> (rapid beeping) The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
From Leipzig to the Midwest And then back again.<eos> She was gone before I was seven years old.<eos> All I remember is this woman.<eos> No.<eos> No, this young girl... crying.<eos> And the... the piano every night after bedtime.<eos> And then one night there was no piano.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> You never saw her again.<eos> No, I did.
Cheers.<eos> So you're, uh-- you're new around here?<eos> Did you kill that bed sheet yourself or what?<eos> It's all I ever want.<eos> Meat, meat, meat. Robert says it's the iron.<eos> - Mm. - What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
Only... what do you say to someone you never met?<eos> "Sorry you couldn't come to her wedding"?<eos> "Sorry she wandered off into a construction site and"...<eos> I'm sure everybody just thinks it's my fault.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I should have walked her home, Jim.<eos> She said she was feeling off and I just let her go and...<eos> You know, no one in her family even knew what state she was in.<eos> The Army is probably just gonna tell them that she died a hero.<eos> She did.
Yes, well, you can give him a chance to atone after the war.<eos> I have family in Eastern Europe.<eos> Cousins that I never met and some that I never will, and my son has never met his grandfather, who is sitting at a pay telephone 10 miles from this office.<eos> The Jewish people don't just need Palestine, Colonel.<eos> We need each other.<eos> What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
Jesus.<eos> What if the charges got turned around?<eos> You did the right thing, Frank.<eos> And I know you will, too.<eos> "I hereby declare on oath that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty"...<eos> That's good enough, Paul.<eos> I hereby declare you a citizen of the United States of America.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> How long did it take him to figure it out?<eos> He didn't.
What?<eos> Your men in St. Louis.<eos> Your father's men who took care of Jean Tatlock.<eos> Have them do it.<eos> Abby. Colonel darrow records every conversation in his office. Did you know that?<eos> I heard you, Charlie.<eos> It was a bluff...<eos> To light a fire under darrow, and then he...<eos> Took things too far.<eos> He did, not me.
He cheated.<eos> Not me.<eos> Doesn't matter. 50% is the default.<eos> But if you're telling me he has complete control of your finances, he might already have hidden money away in preparation.<eos> Meaning... you could get even less.<eos> Are you happy with that?<eos> No, of course not. Look.<eos> By not telling him that you know, you've got an unusual advantage.<eos> You can look into this without him suspecting anything.<eos> So, what do I do?
The GMC felt it wasn't appropriate for me to stay working, so they've asked me to take some time off pending an investigation.<eos> But you're the senior doctor.<eos> Well, what's the complaint?<eos> Chris, you can't ask that!<eos> A man says I threatened to burn him with a lit cigarette unless he left his girlfriend alone.<eos> He said you threatened him?<eos> Well, you've just got to pity some people, haven't you?<eos> Fantasist.<eos> But why would he make that up?<eos> He didn't.
No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - No. Hell, no.<eos> The sketches never have any endings.<eos> It's a big waste of time, just like searching this alley is.<eos> You know, Javi, I think that you need to find a way to be more positive.<eos> No, I don't.
So a show that brought joy, laughter, and "judge booty" to people everywhere may have been built on drug money.<eos> Yeah, but the lawsuit was thrown out, so while Sid was getting rich, van Zant was rotting in prison.<eos> You know, maybe van Zant was who Sid was talking about when he told his wife someone was after him.<eos> Makes sense, right?<eos> If van Zant felt that Sid owed him a share of the profits from the show, maybe he came to collect.<eos> And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> Yo. I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
You'll what?<eos> Tell your friend the deal's off, that I'm a liability you brought to their door?<eos> Can't wait to see where your body turns up.<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> You can take Wade and Nathan, but I expect results.<eos> By the end of the day, Ryan Hardy will be dead.<eos> I'll call you when it's done.<eos> Sorry about the mess, but something tells me your housekeeper's amazing.<eos> Hey. You don't have to be here.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Too bad.<eos> I'm keeping him.<eos> Give him to me, and we'll give you a life where no one is hunting for you.<eos> That's what you asked for.<eos> No. That was when my sister was alive.<eos> That means nothing to me now.<eos> You're not being rational.<eos> When he gunned her down, she looked right at me.<eos> I can still see her face. I understand your loss.<eos> No, you don't.
Come on, let's go.<eos> LAYLA: Where the hell are we?<eos> This brings us back out by the bridge.<eos> Can we...<eos> Can we talk about last night?<eos> About me... not...<eos> Oh, Jamie, we've got bigger things to worry about right now than your erections.<eos> It's really not a problem, sweetheart. It worked perfectly well every other night, didn't it?<eos> Right, yeah, of course it did.<eos> Last night, it didn't.
Don't trust the monkey.<eos> The monkey's pure evil.<eos> Please, listen to me!<eos> - No!<eos> It's not shutting.<eos> - What? What's wrong?<eos> It's jammed. It ain't budging. EXPLOSION<eos> - Somebody drives that truck into it, that might do it.<eos> Yeah, but how does the driver get back inside?<eos> They don't, hon.
- Thanks. - John!<eos> Do you think I wanted this to happen?<eos> Don't you think I'm trying to do the right thing?<eos> And what is that, Toby?<eos> What's the right thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what she's gonna do.<eos> I'm trying to support her.<eos> Do you have any idea how much it costs to take care of a kid like that?<eos> Do you?
- Oh, this bar code won't scan.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Oh, no, no. Let me just use my hands.<eos> You know, that's okay actually.<eos> We can't... it's $19.<eos> ...say no to whatever is happening.<eos> Sofia, she obviously made a mistake.<eos> That's 22.66 with tax.<eos> - You just keep the change. - Oh.<eos> What the hell did you just do?
No, I understand.<eos> Didn't come through here.<eos> You sure?<eos> Birthdays, anniversaries, those I forget.<eos> Equipment serviced here, never.<eos> No one from 51 dropped off a regulator, Kelly.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I went to Air Mask and spoke to Jerry.<eos> You never took your regulator in.<eos> - Sure I did.

I was gonna wack it up with my guys, but it looks like they won't be needin' it anymore.<eos> So how about it, Voight?<eos> 50/50.<eos> Let me walk, and half a million dollars is yours.<eos> You call a hit on two cops.<eos> You come after one of my own.<eos> You really think you can buy your way outta that?<eos> I'm just takin' a page from the Hank Voight playbook.<eos> You have no idea who I am.<eos> Sure I do.
- Hey. - What?<eos> I'm just gonna hang out over here.<eos> And miss out on all the fun?<eos> It's not fun, okay?<eos> They're gonna break me down just like they did at Thanksgiving.<eos> Val, that was an ambush.<eos> A coordinated attack on the homeland, and now we have the upper hand.<eos> Okay, well, they're our parents. They're not enemy combatants.<eos> And don't you want to expose this marriage for the sham that it is?<eos> - Yes, of course I do.
You're welcome.<eos> Lovely.<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> - My problem?<eos> - I just saved your ass.<eos> - He was about to tell me everything!<eos> Where the hell are you goin' now?<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, Uncle Eddie did.
I pose you no threat.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> Say your peace, brother.<eos> Dear lord, forgive me my trespasses.<eos> Protect my Anne from the terrors that await her.<eos> And forgive them, Lord.<eos> They know not what they do.<eos> You were right.<eos> They didn't know what they were doing.<eos> But I do.
You're really bringing that up at a time like this?<eos> You asked, I answered, succinctly.<eos> Well, perhaps I was too hasty.<eos> I'd like, for the moment, to take in the music.<eos> Besides... plenty of other items on our agenda.<eos> The fucking Congo can wait.<eos> Oh, your troubles are weighing heavily on you.<eos> I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible. Yes.<eos> Yes. Of course we do.
The house that I paid for and filled with all the pieces of our lives.<eos> And then when it sells, then that's the end, right?<eos> Then... that's it.<eos> The end.<eos> God, we might not have ever been... right together, but...<eos> I'm just not ready for that.<eos> But, I mean, if you were never right together, then why are you still, like, holding on?<eos> Because then my mother will be right.<eos> She said it would never last.<eos> [sighs] And it didn't.
Wait, why do you have a photo of Jason on your phone?<eos> That's not Jason.<eos> He says his name is Rhys.<eos> Wow, you must be excited.<eos> This is quite some turnout.<eos> - I didn't expect you to...<eos> - Aria, why would I miss this?<eos> I gave you the camera.<eos> Remember?<eos> Yes. I do.
Oh, I missed you so much!<eos> Oh, your hat stinks so good.<eos> Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah. Hayley, cover your ears.<eos> Daddy's gonna make a bang.<eos> - Dad, what are you doing?<eos> - I'm sorry, Hayley.<eos> I know you're excited Jeff's back.<eos> But he knows that Roger's an alien, and he can't stop himself from telling everyone.<eos> So he has to die.<eos> Mom, do something.
She keeps checking her watch like it's past her bedtime.<eos> And the way she's refolding that napkin... too conscientious.<eos> All right.<eos> Little blonde there, in the dress.<eos> Drinking a tonic and lime.<eos> Interloper.<eos> She would say yes only to end up watching.<eos> How many times have you done this?<eos> - You really want to know?<eos> - No, I don't.
People treat you like you're a freak.<eos> That's what happened to me when I was a kid.<eos> No one wanted to be around me, not even my parents.<eos> Devon was supposed to be with me.<eos> Then, he went off with her.<eos> I know.<eos> He deserved to be punished.<eos> They both did, because Devon, he betrayed you.<eos> Right? I get that.<eos> I do.
Is this real? Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Redskins.<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Breadsticks.<eos> Redskins.<eos> Breadsticks.<eos> Redskins.<eos> It just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if it does.<eos> It doesn't, no.
You two are my redheaded pillars of unconditional love.<eos> To my friends at the 12th precinct...<eos> You let me in.<eos> Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.<eos> You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.<eos> And Kate.<eos> Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door. And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right... you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
Why do you suddenly want...<eos> Look, when couples break up, it usually means I don't get paid until the lawyers are all done.<eos> What... why're... you think Lena and I are breaking up?<eos> Why would you...<eos> Look, if you prefer, we could talk about an escrow account.<eos> Well, as much as it pains me to say it, seems like Oscar got a lot of work done today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Speaking of home repair,<eos> I think, um... I think that you... actually have a point.<eos> I do?
Yeah. She's doing good.<eos> Let me ask you something...<eos> Where was Callie when I dropped off Carmen last week?<eos> I had to let Callie go.<eos> I thought she was doing really well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was.<eos> She was doing great.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - He did.
Don't be a silly girl.<eos> You have no such power.<eos> It will dawn, just a day late.<eos> I am now on my way to find your son and your handsome Captain Alden.<eos> And if you should find my son and there is no trace of the dark lord left in him, what then?<eos> Well, that's just not possible.<eos> For your Captain Alden is a very fine soldier, and judging by the taste of his Indian mistress, an even finer lover.<eos> And he may run with him to the ends of the earth, but the seed is already in the boy.<eos> You know that as well as I do.<eos> Do I?
What does she know?<eos> HE LAUGHS Exactly.<eos> Right, what does she know?<eos> What do any of them know?<eos> I identified the car as that seen on the night of Stevie's...<eos> Would you like to amend that sentence, Inspector?<eos> I identified the car as that POSSIBLY seen on the night of Stev...<eos> Of Detective Sergeant Jackie Stevenson's murder... and I pursued the vehicle.<eos> Why didn't you call for backup?<eos> We did.
No, I've never been formally diagnosed.<eos> Yes, I'm aware this is a breach of police protocol.<eos> And when was the last time I spoke to a friend?<eos> I don't have any.<eos> The only one I have... HAD is dead, so...<eos> I'm a... I'm a good officer.<eos> But in this world, that's not enough.<eos> In this world, you have to be able to... nod and smile and drink a pint and say, "How was your day?"<eos> In this world, no-one can be... different or strange, or damaged... or they lock you up.<eos> So, what do I do?
Yes, I'm aware this is a breach of police protocol.<eos> And when was the last time I spoke to a friend?<eos> I don't have any.<eos> The only one I have... HAD is dead, so...<eos> I'm a... I'm a good officer.<eos> But in this world, that's not enough.<eos> In this world, you have to be able to... nod and smile and drink a pint and say, "How was your day?"<eos> In this world, no-one can be... different or strange, or damaged... or they lock you up.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> What do I do now?
"Traumatic grief within normal range."<eos> "No other psychiatric disorder indicated."<eos> "Recommendation - six sessions"<eos> "to be increased to 12" "at the discretion of the psychiatrist in charge."<eos> A copy will be forwarded to all the relevant parties.<eos> You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
The enmity and discord, which of late...<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> - Why did you...? - Yes.<eos> I'm saying yes.<eos> I'll try to trust you.<eos> Rosa.<eos> We trust to our peril... but to not is to be alone... and then... Oh, the silence.<eos> Is that not why you keep us all so close?<eos> You see, I understand you, Inspector,<eos> I really do. This pretence of yours.
Where?<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I'm okay.<eos> No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me? She does.<eos> Then why is she keeping me in the dark?<eos> - I don't need protecting.<eos> - Yes, you do.
So you didn't need my damn eyes on this at all, huh?<eos> No, I...<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can run some surveillance on known DARPA facilities.<eos> It could be black market.<eos> You should ask hunter to contact the back-alley traders he knows.<eos> Hunter's not talking to me.<eos> You know why?<eos> I do.
Did you strip down to your underwear, push Christa cook up against a wall, and hold her there against her will?<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, in hindsight, that might've been too aggressive.<eos> But look... anyone can have their picture taken and claim to be a model, okay?<eos> It was only after she told me off that I got anywhere near the emotion that I needed.<eos> And the pictures prove it, by the way.<eos> And they also prove that he wanted to see Christa take her clothes off every night.<eos> You think he's the only one he did this to?<eos> If this creep did it once, he did... eh.
I've got to wear something nice.<eos> Wow.<eos> She bought it.<eos> So, are you gonna set that meeting with Valerie, or am I?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was expecting Scarlett and coffee.<eos> Well, you got me and nothing.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Mm. How you doing, babe?
I don't want to do any press.<eos> Well, great.<eos> It's a win/win.<eos> I don't get it, man.<eos> Why'd you come out just so you could stay in?<eos> Seems like you took a huge leap for nothing.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But Kevin does.
You can't put this all on me, Scarlett.<eos> You were kissing me back, too, like you wanted to kiss me up on that roof.<eos> I didn't want to kiss you on the roof, Gunnar.<eos> You ignored me for a month, thinking this was just gonna go away, but it's not, because it is real.<eos> It's not something I just...<eos> I just thought up.<eos> You came to the hospital with an agenda.<eos> You wanted this to happen.<eos> So did you.<eos> No, I didn't.
She's effectively single, Kyle.<eos> When I get back here for real I'm going to totally go for it with her, bro.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's definitely something.<eos> You were hurt pretty bad, Budge.<eos> The doctors didn't seem that convinced that you're ever coming back.<eos> You think I'm going to die? No!<eos> No, of course not.<eos> But the doctors do? Hey!
I got called into work. I'm sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> I meeting another friend there, too.<eos> There's something I want to show you that I think you'll like.<eos> It'll be a party.<eos> Just tell them you're sick and you gotta go home.<eos> God, I wish.<eos> But, you know, i have my patients, and...<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> What? We do.
You're gonna take Hap Briggs down, Billy.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> See you around sometime.<eos> You're out of breath.<eos> Yeah, well, I didn't know there was so much to being a host.<eos> I was just checking on the cake.<eos> Here, come with me. Yeah.<eos> No, no, no. Wait. Can I have your attention?<eos> I think... I may be wrong, but I think it's time to sing Happy Birthday to the most beautiful barkeep of the Bakken.<eos> But before we do, before we do...
It'll make Goldman sharpen their pencils a little more.<eos> Show Hap and Lacey the projections.<eos> Oh, this is the foreman out at the site.<eos> Excuse me one second.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is this a bad time?<eos> Well, it was, and then you called.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I need to know if you meant what you said today.<eos> I did, and I do.
So what does that make me, then, hmm?<eos> A consolation prize?<eos> No, Wick, of course not.<eos> I care about you.<eos> But you love him.<eos> - And he...<eos> - He loves you, too?<eos> Is that it?<eos> You know how many of you there have been?<eos> Do you?
Did Lacey give you the good news?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Well, she's going to stay home and work for the old man.<eos> Welcome, Lacey Briggs, to Briggs Oil.<eos> God knows we could use the help.<eos> Come on, Lace.<eos> I got things I got to catch you up on.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know why he had to tell you like that.<eos> I do.
What do you mean you know, huh?<eos> What do you mean you know?<eos> ! He killed my son, Wick!<eos> You have every right to be upset.<eos> That guy is a bad dude, trust me.<eos> - What's that mean?<eos> ! - It doesn't matter!<eos> All you need to know is, you do not want to get mixed up with him.<eos> And you swear to me... you swear to me you don't know where he is.<eos> What if I did?
Look, I'm telling you this so you can protect him before he does something he'll regret.<eos> I'm sorry, Lacey.<eos> Look, I-I just thought you should know.<eos> We're screwed, man.<eos> Hey, calm down, all right?<eos> Just have a drink.<eos> Look, you realize if Gary wakes up and talks, we're done.<eos> That's it.<eos> That is a really big "if," okay?<eos> And what if he does?
Can I speak to my mother?<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> Wick!<eos> Hi.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Dad knows.<eos> I had it out with him.<eos> We're done.<eos> So if your offer still stands, I'm in.<eos> Well, of course it does.
I'm Billy's new partner.<eos> - New partner?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Wow, a lot's changed in the last 24 hours, huh?<eos> Well, I'm not new, actually.<eos> I'm Clifton's granddaughter from the land auction and the trip to Houston.<eos> Huh, Houston.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm guessing he didn't tell you about me.<eos> No, he did not.
Even with the yellow flies and hurricane season?<eos> The truth is, I'd give anything to go back to that version of me.<eos> Of us.<eos> Then...<eos> Why don't we?<eos> I'm willing to take another chance on you.<eos> On us.<eos> Look, if that's not what you want, then you just...<eos> You really got to be honest now.<eos> No, I do.
If he lives, there's no telling what shape his vengeance will take.<eos> I won't let you kill everyone in this city.<eos> - Get off!<eos> No, William!<eos> Oh, forgive me, please.<eos> Everyone in Vega must die.<eos> I love you!<eos> No!<eos> I always loved you.<eos> No... you didn't.
Oh. That's fun.<eos> Casey, I got to eat after I train.<eos> So, it doesn't mean you can't still go get mexican.<eos> And so I'm supposed to just eat a bunch of fucking tacos In front of you, nate?<eos> No, we're supposed to go together.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was the plan. We'll go.<eos> We'll go get mexican. That's fine.<eos> You don't want to. It's... I do.<eos> I do.
You okay?<eos> Why was that asshole here?<eos> Why am I in the tub?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, I told him I needed your pills.<eos> He came over. We smoked a little.<eos> Do you remember having sex with him?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> But he definitely does.
Might as well just... You do nothing.<eos> Might as well do nothing.<eos> You've brought up this issue before, this issue of not feeling like you're in control.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> When we spoke about your father.<eos> You talked about how he chose to do nothing when he was battling his cancer.<eos> You told him he could have fought the company that caused it.<eos> He could have told people about it.<eos> He could have sought better care than what he was getting.<eos> Instead, he did nothing.
What is this?<eos> Do I need to get a real lawyer to handle this?<eos> Could you just not be an asshole today?<eos> I mean, I made this so goddamn easy for you.<eos> You agreed to everything.<eos> If there's something else that you want...<eos> I don't want anything else.<eos> Are you gonna sign it or not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then do it.
Yeah.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get to stay here all alone.<eos> You're an evil, evil girl, you are.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you are.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
Loose.<eos> Keep these loose, loose, loose, loose.<eos> I can't believe you didn't give me nate's first fight back.<eos> You didn't have a spot for him.<eos> I was working on it.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seemed like you were slow-playing us. To see if he was healthy.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm the talent, you know?<eos> I probably shouldn't be hearing this shit anyways.<eos> Hello?<eos> You are so fucking hot.<eos> What?<eos> I'm looking at pictures from the shoot this morning.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I look good?<eos> Well, I haven't gotten dressed yet, If that tells you anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
It's the only place I can come to relax.<eos> I know exactly what you're saying, man.<eos> I was never housebroken myself.<eos> Misha could never get that.<eos> "He who makes a beast of himself... Gets rid of the pain of being a man."<eos> There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> Ah, Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
Happy fourth.<eos> I am so fine.<eos> Hello, hello! Where do I put this? Hi.<eos> Anywhere on the counter is great, thanks.<eos> What's, uh, "e-olve" mean? Oh, no.<eos> It says "evolve". It's one of Dylan's designs.<eos> The neck is the "v".<eos> There's two v's.<eos> There can't be two necks.<eos> Then why even do it?
Show me the hallway.<eos> (Jakes) Welcome, man, I'm glad you could make it.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - What have you got for me?<eos> Oh, we got a surprise for you, you dirtbag, cockney, torturing little bitch.<eos> I think I got something you're gonna like.<eos> [grunts] [clears throat] Bad bitch, isn't it?<eos> - Everybody, get ready to move.<eos> - $1 million. Hey. Yo, I thought you said we own the floor.<eos> We do.
Triple blade. Gillette. Not cheap.<eos> Perhaps she bought it for him.<eos> He doesn't rinse properly.<eos> Huh?<eos> It blunts quicker.<eos> They denied all knowledge of him?<eos> There's no formal employment records at Cristal Kebabs.<eos> Most of it's cash in hand work.<eos> In fact, we're making assumptions he even worked there.<eos> He did.
I never even asked.<eos> I never asked anything about Stevie and now she's not here... there's no-one to ask.<eos> No-one remembers her properly...<eos> I do.<eos> I remember.<eos> Stevie asked me to give you this.<eos> Take it.<eos> There's a couple of hundred quid here.<eos> Daft bird.<eos> What she do that for?
Keep up the good work, player.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Yours in perpetuity"...<eos> Didn't even know you knew that word...<eos> "Alvey 'your king' Kalina."<eos> Alvey Kalina, maker of men, father of three, and business owner.<eos> I was drunk.<eos> Yeah, you're one of those, too.<eos> Nobody reads that jerk-off.<eos> They do now.
Thanks for coming.<eos> You mind if I... Record this?<eos> Oh, this is not an interview.<eos> We're just gonna have a talk.<eos> - I record everything.<eos> - I'd rather you not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> - You really don't have to.<eos> - No, I do.
Good work.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> That was so good.<eos> You are fucking insane.<eos> Well, I try really fucking hard.<eos> So I'm glad you noticed.<eos> So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?<eos> No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out.<eos> - Yeah. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Yes, you did.
But Max, I've wanted my own business since I was little.<eos> It's purely emotional.<eos> I can't really explain it.<eos> I can.<eos> It's your PPT.<eos> Your personal Pop-Tart.<eos> It is.<eos> It's my PPT.<eos> Then I totally get it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Max. You always do.
No, I didn't.<eos> Someone you're sponsoring gets into a fight, disappears, and you don't think to check on him?<eos> Tate didn't disappear.<eos> I did.<eos> It was right about that time that I, uh... Had a slip.<eos> Took me a couple weeks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, 20 years in [Chuckles] I thought I knew all the places I had gone wrong, and I didn't.<eos> It happens.<eos> Certainly does.
She dressed you as a boy to protect you, but really you're a girl.<eos> You have the gift.<eos> It is no gift.<eos> I'm safe as a boy.<eos> This is the first place I've ever been safe, and you want me to throw it away?<eos> To admit what I am?<eos> The Mayor -- what is she up to?<eos> It's nothing good, is it?<eos> I can't see everything... .. but she thinks she's doing the right thing.<eos> They usually do.
- Doctor, for God's sake, will you stop?<eos> I did this, do you hear me?<eos> I did this.<eos> This was my fault.<eos> - I don't care. - Liar.<eos> You always care.<eos> Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> I do.
The Hybrid.<eos> Five minutes to hell.<eos> I think it's time to tell the truth.<eos> Screen on.<eos> 'You were barely more than a child.'<eos> You broke in here and the Wraiths spoke to you about the Hybrid.<eos> Why did that story make you so scared?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't remember it.<eos> Sometimes you do.
So you don't think I'm crazy, right?<eos> No.<eos> Why should men be the only ones who get to trade in their ride for a newer model during a mid-life crisis?<eos> Oh, I'm not having a mid-life crisis.<eos> Somebody should tell your shorts that.<eos> I am just experimenting with my style.<eos> I'm trying to figure out this next chapter in my life.<eos> I really love that Jimmy wants to be a part of it, but it also scares the crap out of me.<eos> I mean, what if I make this huge step and it doesn't work out any better than my marriage?<eos> Or what if you don't and it still doesn't?
No.<eos> Why should men be the only ones who get to trade in their ride for a newer model during a mid-life crisis?<eos> Oh, I'm not having a mid-life crisis.<eos> Somebody should tell your shorts that.<eos> I am just experimenting with my style.<eos> I'm trying to figure out this next chapter in my life.<eos> I really love that Jimmy wants to be a part of it, but it also scares the crap out of me.<eos> I mean, what if I make this huge step and it doesn't work out any better than my marriage?<eos> Or what if you don't and it still doesn't?<eos> Or what if you do and it does?
All right, let's get the job done.<eos> Jesus...<eos> FBI!<eos> Where's your husband?<eos> Betty, where's Phil?<eos> I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired.<eos> We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
The truth.<eos> I have failed.<eos> Will you try again?<eos> Do I have any chance of success?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> What shall you do?<eos> In my entire life, no man has ever made a meal for me.<eos> I feel I should thank you.<eos> You know whose badge that is.<eos> Of course I do.
Let's get those vans loaded up before our friends get here.<eos> I don't want any trouble, not when we're this close.<eos> How long since we heard from the last two harvesters?<eos> Twenty minutes. Maybe more.<eos> Call it. Send the next two in.<eos> We got to keep at it round the clock.<eos> We can't let it grow back now.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> I need to talk to your boss.<eos> No you don't.
How were we supposed to know?<eos> It's not like we run background checks on all her boyfriends.<eos> Well, we have to start.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> - Make nice with that guy?<eos> - You have to.<eos> But... why don't we just send them all home?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then you tell Daphne why you have a problem with Larry 'cause you're the one who said you didn't want the kids to know about our financial problems.<eos> No. I don't.
Aw, that's too bad.<eos> Freddie, Stuart, can I ask you something?<eos> Did you guys like Theo better than me because he was gay?<eos> Ash! You think everybody is gay.<eos> We didn't like him better than you, dear.<eos> Of course not.<eos> We were just being nice to him for the discount.<eos> You're our Ash.<eos> Don't you know that by now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
She wasn't my wife from before.<eos> How'd you meet?<eos> It was early on.<eos> Aaron found me.<eos> I was alone, lost everything.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Myself, I-- I wasn't crazy.<eos> I just gave up on being someone, an actual person.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
Because if I did, there'd be no going back. There'd be no going back to how things were.<eos> I'm from a place where people are still like they were... more or less, better or worse.<eos> I can walk it from here. Till we meet up with my friends.<eos> They got a car.<eos> You can ride with them. How many friends you say there were?<eos> I didn't.<eos> There's two of 'em.<eos> Where are they? We're gonna find out.<eos> How do you know they even got away? That they didn't get taken?<eos> I don't.
- Huxley left with Toran and I.<eos> When he does not show up for drink and whores, the knights will come looking for us. Shh.<eos> Moor. The Roman verses. Are they transcribed?<eos> No.<eos> There are hundreds of pages.<eos> And yet you have time for idle conversation.<eos> You are the punisher. Yea.<eos> Gawain Maddox.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know your name. This is true.<eos> You do not.
- I know it's not what you want to hear, but I need you with me on this.<eos> I need you beside me.<eos> I can't do it on my own.<eos> How can you ask me that?<eos> How can you ask me?<eos> You shut me out?<eos> You go against my wishes here?<eos> It's not easy, Deacon, but we have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I'm saying you need help with her, and I could use a friend.<eos> I have calls in to all those guys, and, really, it's just logistics, so we can deal with all that when we get a little bit closer.<eos> We're all set with pine studios, so you and Markus can get in there and record whenever you're ready.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just... I'm just really upset about this bar and Deacon, and...<eos> I mean, you remember how he was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
This is a dictation.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> You put this whole arrangement together without even asking me.<eos> - That's not true. - Yes, it i... you know, maybe you were right before.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't produce me.<eos> Okay.<eos> But just so we're clear, I'm doing exactly what you asked me to do.<eos> No, that's when I thought you got me, Rayna.<eos> You don't.
All right!<eos> Oh, I can't thank you enough.<eos> Well... you were the one who wowed everybody.<eos> And, uh, thanks to Jeff, that whole Juliette episode this morning was a non-issue.<eos> Well, I guess I ought to give him a hug, too.<eos> Actually, I was thinking of something else.<eos> What's that?<eos> The C.E.O. job.<eos> I thought we already talked about that.<eos> We did.
Okay, Gunnar, you seriously have crazy eyes right now.<eos> - We need to get you out of here.<eos> - No, I didn't write a single thing.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You need to come out and have some fun.<eos> There he is.<eos> Wade, how you doing?
Yeah, it's not a problem.<eos> So, uh, let's talk about your song.<eos> Yeah, I was actually surprised you put a hold on it.<eos> I wasn't sure you were too comfortable with me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, you know, the... launch party?<eos> The way you made sure that photographer didn't get a picture of the two of us together?<eos> I'm not gonna lie.<eos> You've chosen a lifestyle that most of my fans have trouble with.<eos> Frankly, my wife does, too.
Maddie?<eos> Can I talk to you a sec?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Just, you know, checking in.<eos> - I wanted to say good night. - Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Little late for a shower, isn't it?<eos> So now I have to ask permission to wash my hair, too?<eos> No, you don't.
- I tried my best to... to work around you just showing up like this.<eos> I think I'm done pretending.<eos> I called Granddad.<eos> I'm gonna stay with him for a while.<eos> You've chosen a lifestyle my fans have trouble with.<eos> My wife does, too.
I'm not gonna open the Beverly without you.<eos> Hey, you need a ride, Gunnar?<eos> Oh, I'm good. Thanks, man.<eos> Uh, Jesse's giving me a ride.<eos> - All right.<eos> - I'll see you.<eos> Hey, uh, before you go, I just want to say... I had a really great time.<eos> I mean, it worked.<eos> We worked.<eos> Of course we did.
There's not a lot of, you know, us around here.<eos> Us?<eos> Jews?<eos> You're Jewish?<eos> [chuckles] No.<eos> Oh. Ah... you meant...<eos> - I did. - Yep.<eos> Yeah. I just... [laughs] just, uh, panicked for a second.<eos> I thought maybe it looked like I was hitting on you.<eos> Uh, didn't till just this second.
Ignore the condoms.<eos> Well, Liam's not alone.<eos> Thermal scan shows two warm bodies, which means our potential for scandal has just increased. Ooh.<eos> In the meantime...<eos> Now it's a proper stakeout.<eos> Did you at least get us coffee?<eos> Oh, my God. You stole this from Simon, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes. I did.
I should probably go.<eos> You don't have to... to do that.<eos> I know.<eos> - ♪ Cicadas and gulls ♪ - But I want to.<eos> ♪ I'm in the sky, sky, sky ♪ You're so beautiful.<eos> ♪ Because you're mine ♪ Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
You think I couldn't find you?<eos> I never should have said yes when you recruited me.<eos> Obviously you don't want to quit or you'd be in Dearborn already.<eos> So, what is this?<eos> A pep talk?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Say what you want.<eos> I am not good enough.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
What... since we're being honest here, what is it that makes me creepy?<eos> Okay, you can tell me!<eos> All right, you following me right now.<eos> How's that?<eos> Okay, that's not an answer!<eos> All right, does it... does it make me creepy that I notice that you get up every time Alex leaves a room?<eos> Or that you go on long runs in the woods by yourself?<eos> Or that you somehow seem to know this campus like the back of your hand... that's creepy!<eos> You really want to know what's creepy?<eos> ! - Yes, I do!
That was their plan from the start.<eos> And my breaking you out ended that plan.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And we can't find out who they are until they get back to work, which means making them think that Alex is behind bars.<eos> So we give them what they want and wait to catch - their finger on the trigger.<eos> That's one hell of a risk.<eos> If we want to find the second bomb, it's a risk we're gonna have to take.<eos> We know that the bomber planned their attack around the Democratic National Convention.<eos> That resumes tomorrow, which means we have 24 hours to catch them.<eos> And how do we do that exactly?
Not fast for you?<eos> What do you want me to say, Ryan?<eos> That I'm happy you're moving on?<eos> That I'm afraid I'm gonna miss you?<eos> Yeah, that's pretty nice.<eos> Keep those coming.<eos> Look, I need a favor, okay?<eos> I just had a pretty weird moment with Natalie.<eos> You know that scar that she has here?<eos> - I do.
- Then do not be the bad guy.<eos> - Really?<eos> Really?<eos> This is what this has come to now?<eos> Me hoping that you're not gonna chase after the guy that tried to destroy both of us?<eos> He's playing a game with you, okay?<eos> What... what did he say to you?<eos> What changed?<eos> You didn't see him today, Ryan.<eos> I did.
Kid, you're 25 years old.<eos> You need a safety net.<eos> I don't need a safety net.<eos> I was there the last time you screwed up, and the time before that, okay?<eos> So, look.<eos> I'll make you an offer.<eos> You fail this midterm, I'll unlock your trust fund.<eos> That's 10k a month to do whatever you want as long as it has nothing to do with the FBI.<eos> You know, for a second there, I actually thought that you believed in me.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Nimah's swapping back in.<eos> Alley door.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I knew you were right, B.T. Dubs, about that bomb being fake.<eos> No, you didn't.
I know you think you're protecting us, but you expect us to put our lives in each other's hands.<eos> That requires honesty.<eos> It requires trust.<eos> Everyone in that room deserves to know who we are.<eos> If we can't trust them with our secret, how can you trust them with our lives?<eos> Congratulations on passing...<eos> What have you done?<eos> Let's just say I know things you don't want me to know.<eos> I told you everything.<eos> No, you didn't.
What... is she on the short list?<eos> Did you think this was just an open house?<eos> Does my dad know?<eos> Your father is about to become the husband of the most powerful woman in America, so I think he's gonna be okay.<eos> All clear.<eos> There are no bombs here.<eos> He needs to give us some more information.<eos> We're running out of places to search.<eos> I know you know where it is.<eos> I don't.
The raid was led by a Special Agent Clayton Haas."<eos> Look, I told you... they brainwashed me.<eos> All right?<eos> They made me believe that the government was taking away our liberties.<eos> But I... I was 17!<eos> I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
Piece of fucking shit.<eos> Shelby. What?<eos> Um, why do we have these fucking scales from the '70s, huh?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> It's fucking inaccurate.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I weighed myself yesterday.<eos> It needs to be recalibrated, okay?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I don't want to be taken care of.<eos> Come up to San Francisco.<eos> Oh, my God, Dad.<eos> We'll put you in the Point Reyes house.<eos> It's quiet.<eos> You got the... the ocean and the seals.<eos> You can have your baby there.<eos> Be with your family.<eos> Your brothers miss you.<eos> We all do.
Me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hmm? What the fuck are you doing?<eos> You know... What did you say to Laura?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry it didn't work out, but you can't blame it on me.<eos> Why would you mess up that?<eos> Like, why? Why, Mom?<eos> I didn't.
What's the point?<eos> He's not breathing.<eos> You know, my agency exists because yours imploded.<eos> But we came back, albeit with less real estate and a lower profile.<eos> The low profile's the problem.<eos> No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening.<eos> And people need to feel safe.<eos> So all these APBs on alien threats... those are to help people feel safe?<eos> Look, the truth is, you don't understand what you're dealing with.<eos> And you do?
Nope.<eos> He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So you talked to him, but not with you boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So you talked to him, but not with you boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?<eos> What if you do what?
Am I his malware?<eos> I had to wash my face.<eos> Hard to breathe... here.<eos> I know you framed Terry Colby.<eos> Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died.<eos> That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
- I'm about to give a presentation for the fundraiser that we're holding.<eos> What fundraiser?<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Um, okay. I cleared it with Joe.<eos> - The bartender. - Joe...<eos> Joe has no authority to approve this.<eos> If you could just give me two minutes,<eos> - I could explain to you what it is and I'm sure...<eos> - Listen. Listen to me.<eos> I don't do fundraisers.
Agreed.<eos> The killer's tracking its prey.<eos> The question is how.<eos> Alisha knew these people.<eos> They were friends of hers before the Outbreak.<eos> Maybe the killer was, too.<eos> It's possible, but before Alisha was attacked, the couple mentioned that they got some weird e-mail, right? Well, that e-mail had a nasty virus attached to it.<eos> It chewed up the operating system like a blender. I was able to un-mangle it, and it looks like the virus was planted to track their location.<eos> Do we know of any other Inhumans who got this e-mail?<eos> Joey Gutierrez didn't.
Drew?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He's really excited about you.<eos> Yeah, till I shit the bed.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Tonight can only help you.<eos> This is a non-sanctioned fight, so even if you lose, which you won't, it's not gonna go on your record.<eos> - A loss is a loss.<eos> - Then don't fucking lose.<eos> What if I do?
What if I'm not as good as you thought I was?<eos> Then it's on us to work harder and get you where you need to be.<eos> Now go find Alvey.<eos> He's around here somewhere.<eos> He'll take you through your day.<eos> He's good at it.<eos> Whole fucking night, man.<eos> Whole fucking night to showcase Alicia.<eos> Meanwhile, I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> You... we both do.
I'm, um gonna, uh, move to San Francisco and have the baby there.<eos> My dad's there, and my brothers, and I think it's the best thing for me to do.<eos> I'm so sorry to do this to you in the middle of a cut.<eos> I just didn't want you to hear it from someone else.<eos> Do you think you're gonna come back?<eos> Of course.<eos> I don't want you to feel like I'm abandoning you.<eos> No...<eos> You don't even need to think about me right now.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come here, Ms. Martinez.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look out here.<eos> See all these people?<eos> You have any idea what they're doing?<eos> Looking for Rico?<eos> That's right.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> They don't know where he is.<eos> And I don't, either.
- No, I won't.<eos> Congrats on catching the killers, though.<eos> Um, who were they?<eos> You'd hope that they had been terrorists or master criminals and that our people had died fighting the worst of the worst.<eos> But they were a couple of ex-cons playing dress-up and shaking down old people.<eos> Well, at least we got them off the streets.<eos> And you... you... well, it was great seeing you out there today, lending a hand.<eos> Yeah, makes me feel that my sterling personal example hasn't been completely wasted on you.<eos> Uh, didn't you say you needed to, like, bless your flock?<eos> Oh, um, yeah. Indeed I do.
We have him.<eos> What are we gonna do, sic a kitten on them?<eos> The needle on Abe's spear... hand it to me.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Jamie!<eos> - No! No! No!<eos> What do we do?
- What you did with the cub.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Mitch stuck the cub with a needle.<eos> His pain sent a distress call.<eos> It was just like the lions in L.A.<eos> They communicate over long distances.<eos> Oh, that was you!<eos> Yeah, I just put their newfound mutation to good use.<eos> This little guy saved our lives.<eos> We did it, rafiki.
What?<eos> That is reason to book my travel to Clearwater, Florida.<eos> - You sure you can handle this?<eos> - I can fly a cargo plane.<eos> I've done it before.<eos> You can say it, you know.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - "I told you so."<eos> You don't need me to tell you that getting involved with Ray was a bad idea... you know that on your own.<eos> I do.
Frazier Park, one hour.<eos> If she sees me, she'll call the cops.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tell her yes.<eos> I'll go.<eos> She'll be there.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - But you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Well, he can't get to 60, can he?<eos> 50.<eos> 52.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> Oh, it's sinking.<eos> ~ Well.. he was committed.<eos> ~ Help!<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ He was determined to reach 60.<eos> But he didn't, did he?
Mr. Dennis turned it around and had me use it to figure out who to fire.<eos> So this wasn't your idea?<eos> I was trying to get people to get paid more, not paid nothing.<eos> Hi, I'm Carla Groves.<eos> My supervisor asked me to come see you.<eos> Hi. Yes.<eos> Um...<eos> I don't know quite how to say this--<eos> I'm fired.<eos> But clearly you do.
It's a machination of the mind that only works when both parties are fully invested in their chosen roles.<eos> How do you know when someone's fully invested?<eos> You'll know.<eos> Ready?<eos> On your mark...<eos> Get set...<eos> Go!<eos> He wants to submit to you just as much as you want to dominate him.<eos> But... I don't know how.<eos> Sure you do.
I did!<eos> Great!<eos> The squad solved the jewel heist by culling together footage from multiple sources right here in this space.<eos> These are the controls.<eos> Can you show me how they work?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> This is a prop.<eos> Buzz is running the projectors.<eos> Oh, it looks so real.<eos> - Mm. - It sure does.
Any particular reason you chose Brazil?<eos> I know where you're going with this, and, yes, we...<eos> When that picture of Kevin in Rio popped up on the Internet, we had to go look for ourselves.<eos> So, that boy in Brazil, to you, could've been Kevin.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't.
You're the one who flipped out<eos> - over Mike going to Sultry Dolls. - What?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> - Don't blame me.<eos> Jamie shot him.<eos> - The gun was found in your house.<eos> - Hey, I want to cooperate.<eos> - You think they're gonna believe that?<eos> - I don't want to be blamed for any of this.<eos> - Oh, no, you don't.
Man: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,<eos> Mariana Wallace, rest in peace.<eos> Amen.<eos> You okay, Gus?<eos> [ Whispers ] I, uh...<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I-I appreciate very much being able to lay Mariana to rest like this.<eos> But I just feel it's unfair, making me agree not to meet with Paloma till she's 18.<eos> Do you want Paloma to lose everything that she has, Gus?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I realize that, and I know that it is a stretch, but they have these blankets that have been packed away for decades in a cold basement.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just see the family. Take a look.<eos> I know what you're doing, Divya.<eos> You're trying to lure me back to HankMed with a rare disease, but I am not built for clinical medicine.<eos> Of course, you are.<eos> You are a great doctor.<eos> All your patients would say so.<eos> Then they don't know me, and you don't know me.<eos> Jeremiah, I do.
You did the best you could.<eos> You really shouldn't be here, Elizabeth.<eos> You're too involved as it is.<eos> Sarah's right.<eos> Thank you both for your consideration, but it's quite unnecessary.<eos> You're buggered.<eos> Come on, I'll run you home.<eos> That could have been me.<eos> I almost went through with it.<eos> But you didn't.
The uterine wall's perforated.<eos> The man was a butcher.<eos> He should be struck off.<eos> I don't know how I'm going to tell Rene about the baby.<eos> You can't avoid me forever, you know.<eos> If you had any decency, you'd leave.<eos> Is that what you want from me?<eos> Decency?<eos> I have a husband.<eos> You do.
Thank you.<eos> Actually, Jo, there was something I came to say.<eos> I can't give the eulogy at Ryan's funeral.<eos> Why?<eos> To do that would be to say in public that I had complete faith in him.<eos> But there are still doubts over his conduct.<eos> ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
Ah, what the heck?<eos> Congratulations, Milhouse.<eos> You made it through adolescence and you're cuter than ever.<eos> Oh, sweet Lisa!<eos> You know I had a rocky childhood with all the rocks they threw at me.<eos> You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
She was pretty upset.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> What was all that about during the match?<eos> Between you and Eleanor.<eos> She's angry because I've been keeping an eye on her.<eos> You've been stalking her?<eos> I prefer body-guardian angel.<eos> But she disagrees.<eos> You know what she's like.<eos> Actually, I don't.
Shameful, really.<eos> Betting against your own grandson. Mm.<eos> It's the Argentines who should be ashamed.<eos> How could they lose?<eos> Ah. Cyrus.<eos> - Did you fix the match?<eos> - Would I do something like that?<eos> Oh. Well, in that case, I'm going to have to pay you with one of Simon's notes.<eos> The people loved him, didn't they?<eos> Of course they did.
Did Michael kill her?<eos> Did Michael kill Stevie?<eos> No comment.<eos> Is that the cleaned-up files?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Found something?<eos> Wait...<eos> Easy, Tonto.<eos> The one thing, the one thing you asked was that they keep Frankie out of it.<eos> - But they didn't, did they?
Okay, why are you yelling?<eos> You know that makes me flustered.<eos> Highlight the joints.<eos> Bang.<eos> Rheumatoid arthritis.<eos> Those hot spots you see are nodules... very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon, I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
we're not actually leaving?<eos> No, not me.<eos> But I think you should.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, not if you're still here.<eos> Not if Sammy's still here.<eos> Look, I need to be here as long as it takes.<eos> Okay, I do, too, then.<eos> That's the thing, you don't.<eos> You don't.
They haven't even been cleared for field duty.<eos> I cleared them just now.<eos> Seems I might just get my team after all.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Hydra has Fitz and Simmons, and they're planning to open another portal!<eos> Which is why we're going to stop them.<eos> - Yeah, but why us?<eos> - I'm guessing we're all they've got.<eos> You two have powers.<eos> My other agents don't.
You've ever tasted. Yeah, I don't really like duck with orange stuff.<eos> - Get out.<eos> I like the way you operate.<eos> Excuse me? Never let them see you sweat.<eos> What makes you think I'm sweating?<eos> My eyes.<eos> You may have fooled opie with that metaphor, But we both know you got duck à la shit.<eos> Okay, new girl, I don't know who you think you're talking to,<eos> But this is what I do.<eos> What you do.
You know that.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You saw what I did to her.<eos> She's not gonna want to help us. It's not about helping us.<eos> It's about helping her client.<eos> I can't ask her to do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't. - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on. How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
Patrol went into the tunnel.<eos> They found vinyl auto skins on the road way.<eos> They pulled a fast one on us.<eos> Oh, so now Theo Davis is in a van that could be any color, any logo.<eos> He's in the wind without his meds, the takers don't have their money...<eos> You just signed his death warrant.<eos> Put the bag man in the box and get him talking.<eos> I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> You want to know what I don't appreciate?<eos> We really don't.
She's supposed to get bumped up to Deputy Inspector.<eos> She picks out her new office, plans herself a party, gets loaded, tells half the precinct what she really thinks of 'em.<eos> Then the promotion falls through.<eos> Epic.<eos> Ouch. That's why.<eos> Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
- Hmm. Remind me to adopt that cover next time I'm feeling lonely.<eos> Mike get back?<eos> Nah, Briggs has been trying to get at him.<eos> ♪ ♪ I never remember my dreams.<eos> I wasn't dreaming.<eos> Got some strange stuff in here.<eos> - Like wacko strange.<eos> - Yeah. It looks crazy, but... I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
I could hear your ranting from inside the pod, Chopra, for the God's sake!<eos> Feel better?<eos> Commander Nagata.<eos> Young for the responsibility.<eos> Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid.<eos> Marvellous, ma'am.<eos> All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> Deep-Ando, conscript.<eos> Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> Well, he did.
After the Maha Shivaratri/Oshogatsu/Christmas party some of the crew reprogrammed me.<eos> - They did, did they?<eos> - Yes. In order to enter rooms, everyone must do the song.<eos> It's very amusing.<eos> But you know who I am!<eos> You just called me by my name!<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!
They're under my command.<eos> I owe it to them.<eos> To die? They wouldn't thank you for that.<eos> Nor you, Clara. "To die, to die.<eos> "Glamis hath murdered sleep, "therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more.<eos> "Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did.
Oh, he's no one.<eos> I see.<eos> No one sent you flowers.<eos> ♪ You're the last one for me ♪ No, I, um...<eos> I met him at that fetish club.<eos> Adriana took me.<eos> I told you about it.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> - Didn't you get my texts?<eos> - I did, I did.
He's unlike anyone I've ever met.<eos> Oh, the world is full of men like that.<eos> He made me feel, like...<eos> Smart?<eos> Beautiful?<eos> Transcendent.<eos> You are.<eos> And you don't ever need a man to tell you that.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Darling, I do.
You were trying to protect yourself.<eos> Come on.<eos> You... Lied right to my face.<eos> I asked you flat-out, and you said you were not seeing him.<eos> You said, "no, Abby, I'm not sleeping with the president of the United States,"<eos> to my face, and then I had to get up on that podium and be humiliated in front of all my peers.<eos> You left me to die up there.<eos> If I had told you...<eos> If you had told me, I could've protected you. If you had told me, I could've turned off the cameras in the residence.<eos> But you didn't.
If I had told you...<eos> If you had told me, I could've protected you. If you had told me, I could've turned off the cameras in the residence.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> I didn't want you to have to lie for me.<eos> - I didn't want you to...<eos> Did you?<eos> I like Martinis.<eos> Oh, yeah, because James Bond likes them.<eos> It's... hey, nothing to be ashamed of, Perkins.<eos> Every new spy does it.
As my child... As my soul.<eos> That does not end. That never ends.<eos> It just rips a hole inside of you that never closes.<eos> Your child is dead!<eos> You can visit his grave, bring him flowers.<eos> You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
Come on! You could marry anyone you want, and you have to get engaged to a cop?<eos> At least he's not a crook.<eos> I'm trying, okay?<eos> I've changed. I'm straight.<eos> I had a job and...<eos> I wanna provide.<eos> I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.<eos> So much.<eos> I've missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life.<eos> What do I do?
- Mariana Wallace.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Did you just say "new story"?<eos> How does that involve me?<eos> I don't like it already.<eos> I have thought very hard about it, Your Honor, and I'd like the next season of "Identity"<eos> to be about Greg "Slider" Rasenick, the suspect accused of murdering Mariana and who's to be a defendant in your court next month.<eos> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mr. Beck, do you have any idea how complicated a death penalty case is?<eos> - Uh, yeah, I think I have a pretty good...<eos> - You don't!
Ken did it.<eos> He confessed.<eos> Well, to cover for you?<eos> So, Ken goes to jail, you don't have to?<eos> So the whole world doesn't find out that you were trying to steal your sister's husband?<eos> Wait!<eos> Just wait.<eos> [ Stammers ] I think I need...<eos> [ Mutters ] I need a lawyer.<eos> ♪ Yeah, she probably does.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Wait, before you answer, I need you to revoke your rights.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I-I revoke.<eos> I have excellent health insurance.<eos> Hamilton/Lookwood allows me to see any doctor I want with extremely low deductibles, and the prescription plan is awesome.<eos> Anything else?<eos> You said the promotion you missed came with stock options and a bonus of?<eos> The entire package was worth almost $2 million, but I don't know how that's relevant because I didn't get it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Could you do that?<eos> Could you free the general?<eos> I could speak to Mahmoud.<eos> I... think I might be able to convince him, for his own sake.<eos> Except...<eos> - What?<eos> - Except we'd have a general with no army.<eos> Jamal controls the treasury.<eos> I have no way to pay Solomon's soldiers.<eos> I do.
Khalil!<eos> Come down, or, I swear to God, I will cut this boy into little pieces!<eos> Khalil!<eos> I told you to leave this alone.<eos> Take him away.<eos> You were right, Siddiq.<eos> We will not dishonor his sacrifice.<eos> I'm sorry, Abu Omar.<eos> I overstepped my bounds.<eos> Yes, you did.
Bassam left this for Sammy and Molly.<eos> Before the battle.<eos> Once I joined the resistance, I knew that I couldn't be Khalil forever.<eos> That... sooner or later, I'd have to reveal that Bassam Al Fayeed was still alive.<eos> You spared him, Jamal.<eos> You have nothing to feel guilty for.<eos> But the guilt that you hadn't made you paranoid.<eos> It blinded you and turned you against your own family.<eos> Rami didn't kill your mother.<eos> The Caliphate did.
Yes, Sous Chef.<eos> Stop talking so much.<eos> Is the Shrek out for table three?<eos> - Yes, Chef.<eos> - Then, check it off!<eos> Yes!<eos> It's still lunch time. Keep your focus.<eos> Yes, Chef.<eos> I told you it would work out.<eos> Yes, I did it Chef.
That you can't ignite the Promethean Flame because you're afraid to take the plunge and move in with me?<eos> It's... everything.<eos> When I told you I loved you back in Storybrooke, it was because I thought I was never going to see you again.<eos> It was the same way with Neal.<eos> I could only admit my true feelings when I thought I was losing him... and you.<eos> Well, I guess it's even worse than I thought.<eos> You can't even see any future at all with me.<eos> That's not it. Don't you get it?<eos> I'm afraid because I do want a future with you.<eos> - You do?
Because the combined power of Merlin and the Dark One<eos> - makes your knights useless.<eos> - Not true.<eos> My knights will help us defeat our foes if we give them the proper motivation.<eos> How far can your magic transport us?<eos> Far enough. Why?<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> There's something that can help us in another land...<eos> A land called DunBroch.<eos> I did it, Dad.
Oh, is that what we're doing, we're keeping score now?<eos> Really?<eos> Let me ask you this: how does someone fall in love with someone just like that?<eos> Out of the blue, without any encouragement, Lena?<eos> Did it just happen?<eos> Is it something she caught, like a virus or a cold? Is it contagious?<eos> Stef, I'm not trying to fight you here.<eos> I'm trying to fight for us.<eos> Are you asking me if I liked the attention?<eos> Because, yes, yes, I did.
I'm sorry. I'll take it seriously.<eos> Thank you. Don't thank me.<eos> Thank Louis, because he's gonna handle this case.<eos> What?<eos> This is a business matter, not personal.<eos> And I'm not stealing Louis' client.<eos> You're not stealing me. You already handled my divorce.<eos> Are you gonna tell me that Louis is a better lawyer than you?<eos> No, I'm gonna tell you that he's a damn good lawyer, and he'd do anything to protect you.<eos> And Louis doesn't do anything quietly.
You heard me.<eos> You shook that guy's hand like you were his goddamn cousin.<eos> You listen to me. If they wanted to be my client, I'd take them.<eos> But I didn't do that to kiss his ass,<eos> I did it to get what we needed.<eos> We already had what we needed.<eos> No, we didn't. We had a hearing on it in seven weeks. And that C-section bullshit was just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> Between now and then, they'd have figured out a way to put it off for another two years.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh... been a while since I heard that.<eos> 'I'm sorry.'<eos> Hey, Bong!<eos> It's a very good morning, right?<eos> - Bong Bong Roo Bong!<eos> - What is it?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why are you acting like this suddenly?<eos> You said you love being touchy feely like this, remember?<eos> No, I don't.
He's always been there for Len.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'How's life with Cyrus treating you?<eos> ' King Cyrus, and very well.<eos> You used to be Team Helena.<eos> Why the switch?<eos> What does he have on you?<eos> My loyalties lie with the monarchy.<eos> King Simon didn't need me.<eos> King Cyrus does.
I guess I hit the wrong guy.<eos> Hell yeah, you did.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Not really.<eos> I think we just broke up.<eos> Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
I'll be genetically indistinguishable from my Earth-1 counterpart.<eos> Your tests will reveal nothing. Great!<eos> Still gonna run 'em.<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Why are we even listening to him?<eos> How do we know he's not evil like the other guy? He saved my life last night.<eos> The question is why.<eos> I'm guessing you didn't travel between dimensions just to meet The Flash.<eos> That's exactly what I did. I came here to help you, Barry, to stop your greatest enemy.<eos> He already did that.
Maybe for you.<eos> It's never affected me professionally.<eos> R-right.<eos> Uh, well, look, uh, from now on, let's just be honest with each other, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay. I don't know what you see in your girlfriend, and you're getting a little tummy.<eos> What?<eos> Oh... Oh!<eos> I mean, uh I-if I... If I stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh... Oh, no. It doesn't.
I would give you anything.<eos> Oh, then, please, Niklaus...<eos> Make me like you.<eos> You've had a thousand birthdays since.<eos> If I forgot to send a card, it's because I forgot about you.<eos> Is that why you're here, to remind me?<eos> I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah. I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
Geez.<eos> - You all right? - Uh-huh!<eos> What are you doing, Rick?<eos> I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.<eos> Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> But Zeep did.
You okay?<eos> I had six clients;<eos> four are still behind bars.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We're not in the miracle-working business.<eos> It's an assembly line.<eos> Keep the court moving... that's all.<eos> Here's the other thing.<eos> You didn't make any money today.<eos> Yes, I did.
Like somebody else.<eos> Did you ever see Saul use the drop?<eos> - Carrie, come on. - I need to know.<eos> Yeah, I saw him the first time we set it up.<eos> Not since?<eos> I'm deniable. No contact authorized.<eos> We have to move.<eos> So you don't know for certain - it was Saul who put my name in the box.<eos> - Christ.<eos> Do you or don't you?
Hey, Hope is down for a nap.<eos> I thought if I leave now, I could be back in time for dinner.<eos> I can't believe you're seriously considering this.<eos> I want to be here with you and Hope, but I can't just do nothing, and, Jack, those sire-line losers<eos> - took Rebekah. - Yeah. They also went after you.<eos> Look. Let Klaus and Elijah handle this.<eos> Rebekah kept Hope safe for months.<eos> She's my friend, and she's Hope's family.<eos> I'm not gonna look my daughter in the eye one day and explain to her that I sat back and did nothing while those people just kidnapped<eos> - her aunt. - Hayley, you didn't do nothing.
I knew it was a mistake to even get involved Because he wanted it so badly, but he was a long-time client And I cared about him, so I did it.<eos> I evaluated his son.<eos> And I knew... I knew deep down inside he wasn't ready, But I gave the go-ahead anyway,<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> Well, I don't want you to be sorry.<eos> I want you to sit your ass down and tell me the truth About the dream.<eos> I told you before. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I don't know who this woman was.<eos> You know what, I just opened myself up to you To show you that I know what it's like to be you,<eos> But I don't.
And just when you thought we'd lost our operational balls.<eos> We have a green light? We have a green light.<eos> However, I did neglect to mention your conversation with Etai Luskin.<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> How detailed is their intelligence, do you think?<eos> They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
You look like one of the Baader-Meinhof gang.<eos> Do you mind if we talk in the car?<eos> A little paranoid, are we?<eos> Please. I've, I've got no one else to turn to.<eos> What about your former employer?<eos> They've been looking for you anyway--<eos> I imagine to discuss your recent adventures in Lebanon.<eos> I don't know who I can trust there.<eos> But you trust me.<eos> Peter Quinn does.
I didn't trust her.<eos> Because of you, for one thing, but...<eos> Anyway, I didn't believe her. Now I do.<eos> I need you to give her something for me.<eos> What makes you think I'm even in contact with her?<eos> You're saying you're not?<eos> 'Cause we don't have much time.<eos> I'm talking about classified material, for Carrie's eyes alone, not for you, not for your people, not to tweet or post on your Web site.<eos> Carrie only. Do you understand that?<eos> Do you?
Need a minute? Yeah.<eos> A minute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Carrie, this is Numan, aka Gabe H. Coud.<eos> Numan, this is Carrie Mathison.<eos> Laura said she might be bringing you.<eos> I could really use your help.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I want to know what I'm helping you with first.<eos> We both do.
- Because it's not receiving a signal.<eos> - Explain, please. She's saying it's a dead zone. The entire compound.<eos> There must be jamming towers at the perimeter of the property.<eos> What about a workaround?<eos> - I can try, but...<eos> - Try now.<eos> Entering courtyard gate.<eos> She'll be inside in less than a minute.<eos> Without ears on, we need to know that's an SVR safe house, and we need to know it conclusively.<eos> How the hell do we do that?
I trust the man who made them.<eos> Jonas will be with Marwan through the whole process.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> Guarantees.<eos> Actually, it's kind of comforting.<eos> What?<eos> This. You.<eos> Following me around.<eos> I want you to know I don't believe what they're saying about you.<eos> None of us do.
We're pulling you from the field.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> I can rehabilitate myself.<eos> Already, I've talked my way back in this far.<eos> You will never be fully trusted.<eos> And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
There's no elevator.<eos> But whoever they are, they're pretty steamed about this whole thing.<eos> Peter, what-what's going on?<eos> They're taking me to jail!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Don't worry, Dad!<eos> I'll send you a cake with a file in it!<eos> These are just the owner manuals for all our kitchen appliances.<eos> Well, guess I finally have time to learn to reset the clock on the coffee maker.<eos> He never did.
I didn't shoot Cleveland Junior because he was black!<eos> Hey, you don't have to tell me that.<eos> But the media's out there making you look like a monster, all for exercising your constitutional rights.<eos> Grover's a monster.<eos> But don't worry. We're gonna get you out of this.<eos> I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and let them do this to one of my own.<eos> What, you mean your family?<eos> Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, that.<eos> Yeah, right. Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here, set you up with my lawyer, and get these charges dropped.<eos> Well, how you gonna do that?
What is this?<eos> You bleed slowly.<eos> Anybody ever tell you that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look who's Mr. Agreeable all of the sudden.<eos> Mr. Murphy and his amazing zombie boy.<eos> I want to see what happens when you bite a human.<eos> Quit lying to me and show me.<eos> Murphy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, he does.
They could've at least tried to hide this chemical bomb.<eos> Serves them right, it getting stolen and used against them.<eos> Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.<eos> What guns?<eos> Oh, that was actually pretty clever.<eos> Kill them.<eos> "Felicity, the magnetic-arrow gag will never work."<eos> Yes, it will, my love, because I am really smart.<eos> And guess what, Oliver.<eos> It did work.
So, here's the thing.<eos> Amara seems to be growing in leaps and bounds.<eos> Not just in maturity, but in strength and confidence, too.<eos> I don't want her to get out of hand before I'm sure of her loyalty.<eos> I need you to stop overfeeding her.<eos> But you said to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.<eos> Well, now I'm saying something different, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> We don't want a generation of entitled, pudgy kids, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
- Come on.<eos> The A.G.'s office has strict protocols, Castle.<eos> You're not with the A.G.'s office anymore.<eos> I did what I did to protect you.<eos> He gave me a class seven distress code.<eos> That's life or death.<eos> I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on. Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, these aren't prayers, mate.<eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.<eos> Unless you want to redecorate your lovely hut with his brains, I suggest you drop your weapon.<eos> On the floor.<eos> You won't escape this island.<eos> Ah, I don't intend on leaving just yet.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> You really know the place on that map?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do?
I know this is more than a little crazy.<eos> Yeah, well, your friend with the creepy ring asked so nicely.<eos> Please tell me we're not going to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Or, you know, 4,000 year old bad guys.<eos> Just think of this more as a fact-finding mission.<eos> Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen. No one does.
Do we ever kill ourselves in order to deny him that?<eos> You know, in our past lives,<eos> I'm typically the one that makes the plans, and I'm starting to think this is probably why.<eos> Everyone in there is willing to die to protect us.<eos> You don't think that's a little bit insane?<eos> No.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> I think it's what makes them all heroes.<eos> Yeah, well, heroes or not, I'm not letting anyone die for me.<eos> Then don't.
You've already asked the world of me, I'm just asking for the same in return.<eos> Everyone's waiting for you.<eos> Sorry, just something I had to take care of.<eos> So I guess you're off the secret-keeping wagon.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> I think Damian Darhk has someone operating in Central City.<eos> So I sent Barry to run down a lead. This kind of lead?<eos> He didn't know what he was giving me. But I run enough tests on your blood to recognize your DNA sequence anywhere.<eos> Felicity, you don't...
It's my responsibility.<eos> Hey. How we doing?<eos> It's actually a pretty great turnout.<eos> Who knew people would rather pick up garbage than celebrate the holidays, huh?<eos> Not bad for a hippie, crunchy campaign proposal, huh?<eos> Nobody likes an "I told you so."<eos> Accept apparently Star City.<eos> Your approval rating is up 10 points.<eos> I have an approval rating.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
I'm starting to think that maybe you're just using me For random, hot make-out sessions, Which I'm not entirely opposed to,<eos> Can I help you?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I speak mute.<eos> Just communicate what you want With a series of grunts.<eos> Lily: You'll have to excuse beau.<eos> He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal. Yeah.<eos> We do.
Yeah, and thanks to you, Alaric is probably still at home waiting for that second blue line to show up, so you know what?<eos> Maybe now would be an appropriate time to call him and explain how you could get something so important so incredibly wrong.<eos> Do I need to remind you that you summoned me here for my help?<eos> If you don't think my talents are up to snuff, then I will gladly find other things to do with my time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of... magical juju.<eos> Look. Can you just please help us and take away these people's compulsion?<eos> Julian: Do you know what true bravery is?<eos> Most people don't.
"But could youth last and love still breed, "had joys no date, nor age no need, "then these delights my mind might move<eos> I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.<eos> Well, there's a lot about me that you haven't... allowed yourself to know.<eos> ♪ Need some relief ♪ ♪ Sick of leaving things... ♪<eos> The poems of sir Walter Raleigh, a proper Englishman.<eos> Oh, this looks like a decent edition.<eos> ♪ Sick of leaving things half done... ♪<eos> Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Excuse me?<eos> - Writing the book.<eos> What are you hoping to accomplish?<eos> I'm just trying to take care of my kid.<eos> Oh. At the expense of someone you also claim is your kid?<eos> She is my kid.<eos> I think the courts established that.<eos> Lori, you have no authority to write a book about Carter,<eos> - or about any of us.<eos> - Actually, I do.

Yeah, well, that guy's a maniac anyway.<eos> Nah, this was just, uh, family stuff.<eos> My wife... soon to be ex-wife...<eos> I told her that I can't pick up my kids tonight, and she's not too happy about that.<eos> How long's it been?<eos> Well, we've been separated over a year now.<eos> Not my choice, but definitely my fault.<eos> Let me guess... you're hard to live with.<eos> I have my demons.<eos> Don't all cops?
Mostly I dealt with people under him.<eos> I know he's some sort of international consultant.<eos> It is true, I am not the first consultant in the family, but the title is where the similarities end.<eos> Father's business exists to grease the skids so that politicians and corporations can operate around the globe.<eos> Sometimes these are noble ventures.<eos> More often, they are not.<eos> But they happen because Father is an influence peddler par excellence.<eos> And if he says he can restore us, he means it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I did not.
I should not have discriminated.<eos> You are very clever.<eos> We did you a favor coming all the way out here for whatever the hell this is.<eos> You're not gonna let this man insult my client.<eos> Clever is a compliment, counselor.<eos> You want insults, just wait.<eos> You'll be hearing "triple murderer" in a minute.<eos> That is what I'm implying, Ms. Von See.<eos> That without any particular skill or training with firearms, you were able to create a bloodbath here that would look like the work of a professional.<eos> You did this yourself.

Your Majesty?<eos> Let me help you.<eos> - I can do it.<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> But don't be so stubborn.<eos> Everybody needs a little help sometimes.<eos> Let's not say goodbye.<eos> - Let's just say...<eos> - I love you.<eos> They always do.
Yeah.<eos> Adalind had the baby.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> Healthy? Yeah.<eos> I wonder if anyone will ever tell him the truth about how he got here.<eos> Not gonna be me.<eos> I just thought you should know.<eos> Hey, Hank, I'm going to partner you up with Pogue until Nick gets back.<eos> I don't need a partner.<eos> Well, Pogue does.
You have access to all the accounts?<eos> Yes. But, I'm not the only one.<eos> Any money missing from the company?<eos> No. You sure about that.<eos> As far as I know.<eos> Isn't it your job to know? My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Why?<eos> He was so angry if you did not as he said, especially if he was high.<eos> So you knarkade to the Victor would not get angry?<eos> Tobbe dumped the Ebba she never dared take something.<eos> If you just tell us what happened.<eos> In the beginning, it felt quite okay.<eos> I thought... perhaps it could become really good if we had sex.<eos> But it was not. -lnte now.<eos> He could not get up it.<eos> But it did like nothing.
Alex was the last person to hold your hand.<eos> Question?<eos> Statement.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> You blame me for his death.<eos> - Question?<eos> - Statement.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Call off the entire American government?<eos> But that's it? He's accused of a capital crime, okay, and unlike the U.K., America has the death penalty.<eos> Do you want to send an innocent man to his death?<eos> Look, I have no problem telling the FBI to bugger off.<eos> But this plan of yours will only work if you can actually deliver your friend.<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
Why am I cleaning up the mess from last shift?<eos> Because, Dr. Savetti, you're a resident, and your mama said so.<eos> Dr. Pineda, tell him what else I say.<eos> If you want to be part of a team... No job is too big, no job is too small.<eos> Being an emergency-room physician requires humility.<eos> And like a firefighter cleans his rig, you clean yours.<eos> This is Center Stage.<eos> It demands your respect.<eos> Sorry, Dr. Lorenson, but did you want to lay down?<eos> No. Uh, no. I didn't...
He had a long wait... 10 hours... which didn't help.<eos> To me, it sounds like a muscle spasm, or, at worst, a compression fracture of the spine.<eos> Which is probably common in his line of work.<eos> I think a CT of his back would be the right precaution.<eos> Sounds right.<eos> Get him scanned.<eos> Let me know what comes back.<eos> Dude, you could've told her your theory.<eos> - I don't have a theory.<eos> - Yes, you do.
She lies for a living.<eos> Oh... not true.<eos> I'm starting to feel a little attacked.<eos> Then it's a good thing we have a peer mediator in the family.<eos> Talking stick, anyone?<eos> Same one I've used to settle many a disagreement at school.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're a loser.<eos> Hey, it works.<eos> Yeah, it does, just not on the brain-dead.
Which means we round up Everyone that knew him.<eos> Drinking buddies, family, People he worked with.<eos> Work colleagues, Even neighbors -- That means you.<eos> But didn't we connect Jimmy back to edgeway?<eos> We did.<eos> But they're gonna want to Cover their bases And make sure there aren't Any pissed off Business partners, Jilted lovers.<eos> I was hardly jilted, But won't it look bad To the cops If they know I was involved with him?<eos> It'll be worse If you lie, betty.<eos> It's not the crime, But always the lie That catches up to you.<eos> So what do I do?
Previously on "Defiance"...<eos> I didn't see Nolan.<eos> Someone took him.<eos> But he's alive.<eos> I can feel him.<eos> I have chosen this human as my hiakim, my pet.<eos> My mother, you know where she is, don't you?<eos> I do not.
By my last count, there's six plus Kindzi against the entire town. We can beat 'em.<eos> Can we?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> Hell, it wouldn't feel like home if we weren't on the verge of annihilation.<eos> No, this time it's different.<eos> This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
No, no.<eos> Hotch:<eos> But you also love your sister.<eos> We know you're sad, dana, But hurting nicole is not gonna make that go away.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.<eos> Oh, my god, dana, don't!<eos> Ryan, tell her you love her, right now.<eos> Dana, I--I love you.<eos> I--I do.
"'tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all."<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow, so that's where the sun went.<eos> Nice rock.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I love him.<eos> I really do.
I want to return it.<eos> I'm Meral's nephew.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> OK then.<eos> Since you're the nephew.<eos> - Please.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Did you fill up the tub?<eos> Did you?
- So we let him go?<eos> - He works for us.<eos> Sir...<eos> I know Meral and Ali very well.<eos> - I hope there's no mistake.<eos> - Go on, back to your work.<eos> Good God.<eos> Sir, what did they do?<eos> You'll know soon.<eos> Do your own job.
People Ted delivered to.<eos> Methodical bastard.<eos> He studied the lives and habits of everyone he visited.<eos> All these terminally ill patients were just a mark for him.<eos> You can bet he was stealing from all of them.<eos> He was making very good scratch from the sales.<eos> Which probably seemed like small potatoes once he found out how much bank Nina was putting away.<eos> Yeah, with all the publicity she and April were getting, he turned it into his own cottage industry.<eos> You wondered how she paid for all the makeup?<eos> She didn't.
Don't thank me yet.<eos> You haven't heard my demands.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Yeah. And you lied to me from the start, Vin.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing, man.<eos> I just wanted the money.<eos> I try to be a good Bali man, I get nothing. I try to be an American... it's much worse, man.<eos> Maybe I did something terrible in last life.<eos> After all this, Vin... you can't still possibly believe in karma.<eos> Of course I do.
No, you should not interfere!<eos> Anja!<eos> Do not go in. They must do it themselves.<eos> Help me open this door!<eos> Stop!<eos> No, no, no, no! No don't!<eos> Anja? Anja, you hear me?<eos> Anja, the ring ... You have to give her back the ring! Anja, the ring!<eos> Anja, you hear me?<eos> Please, do something!
I have a vote to prepare for.<eos> Wait, what if I flip my vote?<eos> Flip whatever the hell you want, Louis.<eos> But you started this ball rolling, and now we all have to live with the consequences.<eos> I thought you were trying to avoid me.<eos> I was.<eos> But then I figured out you knew it was me anyway.<eos> How?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I was doing you a favor.<eos> Mary Margaret: Come on. This is premeditated murder, Emma.<eos> There had to be another way.<eos> You should have come to us.<eos> And risk losing someone else?<eos> I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself.<eos> But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine. You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No. We don't.
Don't listen to him.<eos> He's not real.<eos> But I am. I'm right here.<eos> Look at me. That future you told me not to be afraid of...<eos> We can have it. The house in Storybrooke.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours. You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
The Enchanter wants to spirit me away to Australia.<eos> Do you have any idea where Australia is?<eos> Why would I know something like that?<eos> It's far.<eos> You would never see me again.<eos> Here's a novel idea.<eos> Tell the Enchanter, "No, thank you."<eos> Tell him that you love your husband!<eos> You do not understand the Omec.<eos> And you do?
No, no. Right, no, no...<eos> You're fired.<eos> 50 years it's been sitting there.<eos> It's unstable, it's poisonous.<eos> But what if we could extract the monocane we need from this, make a fresh potion?<eos> Shut this place down. Walk away.<eos> - And then what?<eos> What do you think would happen to me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Garrett?<eos> Add it all up at the end of the year, yeah, he more than pulls his weight.<eos> He's a good guy, too.<eos> Stubborn.<eos> But yes.<eos> You want to take back your offer for me to make him an offer?<eos> That stands separate.<eos> You mean, you didn't?<eos> No, just checking.<eos> So, you did?
This one doesn't seem like part of their playbook.<eos> My money says it's the new guy.<eos> Well, he was smart enough to hide his face and he didn't burn the place down.<eos> We still have to wait for the autopsy, but, she's fully clothed.<eos> Doesn't look like there was sexual assault either.<eos> But he still made them watch. Look.<eos> He positions them so they're facing each other.<eos> That aspect is important to him, almost compulsive.<eos> You think he's ok? No.<eos> I don't.
Look, here's the campground...<eos> Try and get some rest, ok, baby?<eos> But I'm not tired.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> We'll get you something to eat soon.<eos> Mama, can I play on your phone?<eos> Oh, baby, mama forgot it.<eos> We're gonna get you something to eat soon, I promise.<eos> He needs to eat.<eos> We all do.
Yeah, it's time to finish this.<eos> I'll be finished when time is erased and you two are dead! Aah! Aah!<eos> Stay with the plutonium. Aah! Mordecai!<eos> You were the worst teacher. Stuff it. Aah!<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this. I'm sorry for ruining your dumb volleyball game, okay?<eos> Just let it go, man.<eos> Let it go?<eos> !<eos> Do you know what it feels like to dedicate your life to something and then have it ruined? !<eos> Yes, I do.
Rigby! Mordecai, what are you doing?<eos> I can't let you do this by yourself.<eos> The game's not over yet, boys. Now, who's ready to die? !<eos> Raaaaah!<eos> No!<eos> Rigby, catch! Aahhhh! - What the...<eos> - Hyah!<eos> - Ha. You missed.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Uh, yeah, you did.
That's right.<eos> Anyone have any suggestions?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna call it.<eos> Time of death... 7:01 A.M.<eos> Back to work, everyone.<eos> It's beating.<eos> When did it start beating again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The hard reason to do this... The "no heart rhythm" part... We don't have it anymore.<eos> No, we don't.
So, will you stop worrying, or do I need to take you into one of these empty rooms to make you relax?<eos> Miss Guthrie, hi.<eos> We're the...<eos> The lawyers. I know.<eos> I won't lie for them.<eos> Lie?<eos> No.<eos> We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed.<eos> No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
Can I borrow one of yours?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, you can borrow mine.<eos> Uh, he has a boyfriend.<eos> His name's Oliver, and he's wonderful.<eos> What about you?<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> 'Cause, uh, this is just a ploy for me to sneak my number into your phone.<eos> Levi.<eos> She doesn't have a boyfriend.<eos> Um, actually, I do.
Or because you were slicing your aunt's throat.<eos> No! God, no.<eos> Then why do we have surveillance footage that puts you one block from your aunt's car?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I run the same route every night...<eos> River Road to the park and then back home.<eos> That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now? Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
Like, if I saw him on the street, I wouldn't even recognize him.<eos> So... Yeah, that's the long, sad, cliché story of how I got it.<eos> Because I cheated on you.<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> It was my bad decision.<eos> Yeah, that you made because of me.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> You didn't have to come.<eos> Of course I did.
What am I about to say?<eos> "Three days are up.<eos> Where's your cash?"<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Oh, no, come on.<eos> Don't make me be this guy, walking in here, you know, talking about breaking legs or worse.<eos> Ow!<eos> Ah, ah!<eos> Do you know what I do for a living?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Here's a list of the NGOs operating around ISIS territory.<eos> Follow up personally with the evacuation recommendation.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Of course.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. I...<eos> I have to talk to Tyler Hogan?<eos> This would be<eos> Tyler "the Hammer" Hogan?<eos> He's very nice if you get him in a good mood.<eos> How do I do that?
We'll be out of here soon enough.<eos> After you, your Emissary.<eos> Savior of the human race wasn't good enough for you, huh Murphy?<eos> Needed to be the alien ambassador too.<eos> I'm working my way up to Supreme Leader of the Planet.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan Scully.<eos> And I bet you don't believe any of this alien exodus crap either do you?<eos> No, we don't.
It's time someone put the balls back on this throne.<eos> Back on this country.<eos> Stand up, please, sir.<eos> You can't arrest me for drawing a cartoon.<eos> I have a right to my opinion.<eos> If you want free speech, go to America.<eos> Great work, Cabral.<eos> Careful what you paint.<eos> - You certainly showed them.<eos> - I certainly did.
Just one question.<eos> Please.<eos> Fine, if it means you'll be gone quicker.<eos> Come on.<eos> How well do you really know Mandy?<eos> What is it about this girl that's got everyone's knickers in a twist?<eos> Including your own.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Doesn't anybody care that I'm happy?<eos> Of course I do.
I should... go.<eos> Happy Birthday, Princess.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Do keep in touch.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> You do realize it's filled with champagne?<eos> The good stuff.<eos> And are you kidding?<eos> Of course we do.
It means you're a cancerous dead king walking.<eos> Which also means there's a God.<eos> Get out!<eos> Or I'll have you removed by palace guards!<eos> You listen to me, little man!<eos> The monument is going to happen!<eos> No, it isn't!<eos> And for your information, the King sort of runs things around here!<eos> Oh, do you really believe that?<eos> Because you don't.
Yes, shut up.<eos> Say no to drugs.<eos> You know, I thought I knew what life would be like for you both, and Robert.<eos> But I think even I underestimated just how isolating it would be for you.<eos> For all of us.<eos> No, I've been high all day.<eos> You think we have it tough, take a look around.<eos> People struggle all the time.<eos> They do the very best they can and they fight to live another day.<eos> We all do.
I know something you don't know.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Won't say unless you take me with you on this.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on. I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
- Damn!<eos> Jai Hind Sir. - Take a seat. -<eos> Whose idea was it?<eos> Which idea, Sir?<eos> The honor killing one...<eos> My experience Sir... the fruit of days and nights of hard work it was a very difficult investigation...<eos> Very difficult.<eos> Ah, 'Investigation'!<eos> So you were the first one to arrive at the scene? Yes Sir.<eos> And what did you do?
- Arda!<eos> - Hey, go easy on your chief.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Who fucks an animal for their first time?<eos> Son... haven't you served in the army?<eos> 70 percent of all Turkish men, lose their virginity by fucking an animal.<eos> - Whoa! - Make it more like 20 percent chief!<eos> He's a city boy, this one.<eos> I bet his daddy took him to a brothel.<eos> Did he?
But you are in need of upgrade.<eos> A violin... as lovely as you.<eos> It was a handcrafted Guarneri.<eos> - More valuable than my byt.<eos> Never played anything like it.<eos> We were happy once.<eos> Till my mother started making up all those...<eos> lies. What lies?<eos> She said he cheated.<eos> He didn't.
Yeah, Kyle loved your brother so much.<eos> I don't think your brother ever really forgave himself for getting Kyle into that lifestyle.<eos> Oh, did-did Kyle tell you that?<eos> No, your brother did when he became Kyle's sponsor.<eos> Excuse me, Mya, um, we do have to start prepping.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
I am moving across the gastrocolic omentum.<eos> Suction.<eos> Thank you. That's it.<eos> Okay, let's see what we've got in here.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Damn it.<eos> - What is that?<eos> It looks like the tumor's invading the transverse colon.<eos> Which didn't show up on the C.T.<eos> No. It certainly did not.
Good luck with the heart, Dawn.<eos> I really mean that.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I feel like there's something that I'm supposed to say to you, but I don't know what that is.<eos> There's nothing to say.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't protect you.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I went against my gut.<eos> I knew it was a bad idea bringing you in there.<eos> Well, why did you do it?
It's gonna be really embarrassing if I have to call security on you.<eos> I came to apologize.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You see, I just became a father, too.<eos> And, uh, I have no idea what it is you must be going through right now, what, uh... what it must be like to see your child like this.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> And the fact that she did this to herself...<eos> I mean, I... I can't even imagine the guilt you must feel... That there were signs you should have seen of how much she was hurting inside.<eos> But you can't blame yourself.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Clamp.<eos> We've got the artery exposed.<eos> I'm gonna put a bulldog on the distal while you thread the catheter proximally.<eos> Okay, almost there.<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Nice. Give me the clamp.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, let's tack the enema down 'cause, uh, we don't want that happening again, now, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
Looking for a hero.<eos> Leanne?<eos> Dr. Hudson.<eos> Say hello to Doctors Savetti and Lorenson.<eos> Neal Hudson.<eos> Congratulations on matching to Angels.<eos> You're learning from the best.<eos> I didn't mean what I said before.<eos> I don't think those things about you.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, you don't care about my father, and you don't care about me.<eos> You just want to cut him up.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Shh.<eos> I want to tell you how fabulous you look right now.<eos> I do?
He's helping us get the old Mustang up and running.<eos> That's right, Harvey, I'm getting the Mustang.<eos> And if you think you're ever getting behind the wheel of that car--<eos> I'm never gonna get behind the wheel of that car.<eos> Because you're jealous.<eos> Because that car's a piece of shit.<eos> Harvey, watch your mouth.<eos> Lil, do we have enough for an extra plate?<eos> Sure.<eos> How you doing, Bobby?
Okay, can I ask?<eos> How can I be his ideal woman, and five minutes after we break up, he's dating some barista who can't even properly use the possessive apostrophe?<eos> Did you Facebook stalk?<eos> No.<eos> A little.<eos> Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Does he?
Let's go.<eos> Cover the back.<eos> This way.<eos> Come on. Go.<eos> William, please listen to me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Just finish the thought.<eos> Unless Jay really gets shot in the foot.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, once again, in only seven years of marriage, but please put the gun down.<eos> Don't be a baby.<eos> It's a pellet gun.<eos> It's just going to be a little Nick on the side, and then we go to the game.<eos> They're gonna see that it's true.<eos> They're gonna feel horrible because they didn't believe us, and then we don't have to go to anything for a whole year.<eos> - Mm. - I have to say, it makes sense.<eos> No, it doesn't!
Sugar.<eos> That's not a glow.<eos> I had a doughnut.<eos> Yeah, it fell on my face.<eos> I had to eat it, or I would suffocate to death.<eos> I've been on my best behavior, and you're not holding up your end, which, for some godforsaken reason,<eos> I'm not even allowed to comment on!<eos> Oh, maybe we could have a cheat day, and that day could be... today?<eos> Know what I'd like to pound?<eos> Oh, I sure do.
A lady never tells.<eos> Oh, and... erm... speaking of exploits... ..yours have upset the people.<eos> Since when is a wolf concerned with the opinions of sheep?<eos> A wolf cannot feast on lamb alone if the flock has bolted.<eos> You suggested a push for power.<eos> I have always had an iron fist in a velvet glove.<eos> You took the gloves off and that was a grave mistake.<eos> You need to subjugate your subjects.<eos> And I, luckily for you, have a plan.<eos> - You always do.
And I messed it up.<eos> Royally.<eos> - So if you have feelings...<eos> - I don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> People just love me for what I am, Mum... they don't love me for who I am.<eos> That's just not true!<eos> Eleanor, look at me.<eos> Are you saying no one will ever love you for who you really are?<eos> Someone already does.
Like?<eos> How you did all that.<eos> Alone.<eos> Right place, right time.<eos> That threat wasn't even on their radar.<eos> Good police work, I guess.<eos> But feel free to take the credit for it.<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I also told them that if you had help, say an informant, that I'd be the first to know.<eos> So... did you?
Oh, I wouldn't worry about him.<eos> He's just whipped.<eos> Don't I know you somehow?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Go wait by the door.<eos> So we have a deal?<eos> You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones.<eos> - Whatever those are. - One, two, three, four!<eos> - He bought it.<eos> - Yes, he did.
Watch.<eos> Night Owl 5, Night Owl 5, this is Eagle 12.<eos> Eagle 12, I got a copy.<eos> See?<eos> There it goes.<eos> You okay, bud?<eos> I really miss my dad.<eos> I don't think anyone gets how much.<eos> I do, kid.<eos> I do.
No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
Okay, so can you just do me a solid and get forensic analysis on that letter, please?<eos> Maybe the prankster's in the police database or something.<eos> - If you can't do it...<eos> - No, no.<eos> - It's a long shot, but I got it. - No, if you can't do it...<eos> You're gonna help me?<eos> You say that like I've got some great, big wall around me.<eos> You're right.<eos> That's my bad.<eos> You do.
- all in an effort<eos> - to prove your clients were innocent?<eos> - This is beyond the pale.<eos> It's character assassination 101.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> - Why should we believe your account - of what happened to Ms. Todd?<eos> - Objection.<eos> Mr. Crouse's background has no bearing - on what he witnessed.<eos> - And yet in my mind, it does.
It turns out Open Vistas is no ordinary rehab.<eos> They specialize in Marks syndrome, a brain disorder common to former Precrime prisoners.<eos> Halo burn.<eos> So you're saying my victim was a nurse in a building full of killers?<eos> I'm saying my victim, and future-killers, technically, the city set them free after Precrime was abolished.<eos> Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
Continuous.<eos> Mostly user ratings, uh...<eos> - micropayments.<eos> - Pretty nervous, even for a job interview.<eos> What's going to happen when he sees blood?<eos> Well, uh, we're placing candidates with our detectives in the field immediately.<eos> It's a trial period so that we can test compatibility.<eos> It does not mean you have the job.<eos> I'm not sure I want it.<eos> Of course, I do.
I don't know if it really helped.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Might need a follow-up.<eos> What about you?<eos> After your father was killed?<eos> - Or is that too hard to talk about?<eos> - Okay, please don't turn this into every relationship I've been in for the last ten years.<eos> Yes, it was a traumatic event and, yes, there's some stuff I need to deal with.<eos> And I will when I have time.<eos> But right now I don't.
Is the discomfort worse at night?<eos> A little bit, but the medicine helps.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, I think Dr. Campbell's right.<eos> You should make a full recovery.<eos> In case you were wondering, Watson, Mr. Abramovitch does not have an alibi for the night of Abby Campbell's murder.<eos> I don't think he did it. Neither do I.<eos> But that's because I stayed for the duration of his interview, and I saw no indication that he was lying.<eos> Why do you think he's innocent?<eos> Because I'm pretty sure I know who did kill Abby.<eos> You do?
- I remember this one time, me and Chad were kayaking in the San Juans.<eos> He told me, "If I ever die, bro,<eos> "I don't want it to be lame."<eos> He said that he wanted his death to be like his life.<eos> An epic party, where anything goes, but clothes!<eos> Remind me again how this is for work.<eos> Oh, it's hard to explain.<eos> I'm trying to be bro-active. Oh.<eos> Ladies!<eos> No, I don't do Mardi Gras beads.
Is she wanting to be won back?<eos> When we first met, it was my roguish charm that caused Beckett to drop her guard, but it was my sherlockian skills that made her fall in love with me.<eos> I just have to solve a few cases with her to show her that, together, we are still magic.<eos> Richard, you do know that you cannot just barge your way into the precinct and talk your way onto a case anymore.<eos> I am a licensed private investigator.<eos> I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
Check with my doorman.<eos> But if you're thinking whoever was having an affair with Peter killed him...<eos> I might be able to help.<eos> Now we're talking.<eos> My study deals with extracting secrets from unwilling subjects.<eos> And Peter revealed that he was having an affair?<eos> So, who was he sleeping with?<eos> Someone on that list.<eos> Dean Feller, I'm sure you know why you're here.<eos> Actually, I don't.
The woman I work with at the FBI is Rebecca Harris.<eos> They have a file on her father.<eos> He was using NZT, and then he got murdered.<eos> You haven't said anything to her, have you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> But if I can find out what happened to him, maybe there's a way I can let her know without telling her what's in the files.<eos> Look, if you know anything, just tell me.<eos> Wh-What do you care?<eos> About Rebecca Harris's dad?<eos> I don't.
Yes.<eos> - You probably want me to stop asking questions, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> ELIZABETH: I'm home.<eos> Run upstairs and tell the girls dinner's in about ten minutes, would you?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, so I've had about 20 minutes in the car to process this news, and I think I know what's going on.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
See, I wish you'd taken my call, 'cause then I wouldn't have to embarrass you in front of the Secretary of State.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Sugar beets are the seventh-largest crop in Idaho.<eos> You know what the sixth is, Elizabeth?<eos> No.<eos> Marijuana.<eos> Which is still illegal in Idaho, as I recall.<eos> - And unless you want the DEA doing flyovers of every farm from Boise to Coeur d'Alene, you will give the president your support on this issue.<eos> You know we do all we can to crack down on the pot growing.<eos> Do I?
He's my friend. This is Dash.<eos> Okay, Whit's a dick.<eos> Whitman Cho...<eos> Grew up with Cayman.<eos> High school, college, lacrosse camp.<eos> Oh, well, there you go.<eos> Don't hate on lacrosse!<eos> Pretty big party, Cayman.<eos> But you said last night you wanted to talk about work.<eos> I did?
I'm sorry about that.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I love it down here.<eos> Some people don't get it.<eos> Yeah, it's good energy.<eos> It's real.<eos> Cayman and company back there can be kind of soul-crushing.<eos> Why would you want to be friends with people like that?<eos> I don't.
This "Fiddler's Neck." Is this where you grew up?<eos> I didn't peg you as a country boy.<eos> Guess that explains the good manners.<eos> Well, we sort of moved there later in life.<eos> Fresh start.<eos> Must have been hard.<eos> I knew kids who grew up in the system.<eos> They all have a hard time getting close.<eos> I wish I could tell you that I couldn't remember everything that happened.<eos> But I do.
No arrest, no nothing.<eos> But if you don't keep up your end of the deal, I'll make sure every chola in Miami knows Double Tap got her ass handed to her by a puny punk-ass cop.<eos> Oh, where I'm from, we don't walk away from no fight.<eos> Mm. I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> Mm. Okay.<eos> That's how you want to play, bitch?<eos> - Yes, yes, it is.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> I really do!
I'm checking her alibi.<eos> No, I think the snorkeling story's legit.<eos> See, the microbial friends in the water caused an ear infection.<eos> That's why she's... see?<eos> She's rubbing her upper jaw.<eos> That's an ear infection.<eos> She could have been snorkeling at any beach.<eos> All right, check the alibi.<eos> I'll go to work on the fiancée.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Kerry was being followed by a blue car just before the accident.<eos> Are you a big fan of the Hotel Clarise in Brickell?<eos> Never been.<eos> You bought a bottle of Bordeaux on your credit card at that hotel last week... the same hotel where Marty was murdered.<eos> I reported that credit card stolen.<eos> Have you and Marty ever rolled around under the sheets without any clothes on?<eos> Once.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - I do.
That did not happen.<eos> Max is painfully single.<eos> But the point is this... everyone has a story, okay, and you don't care to learn about anyone else's but your own.<eos> By the way, good morning.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> Do anything fun?<eos> Yeah, actually, I took a stroll, went to the market, bought some organic peaches, made a pie.<eos> It was yummy.<eos> You did that?<eos> No, I did not do that.
Just, please, can I just get two minutes with him?<eos> Fine. Two minutes.<eos> So, I understand you attended Fillmore.<eos> That's my mother's school.<eos> She was your principal.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Does she remember me?<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Nobody does.
Boss briefed the fire captain, told him it's a crime scene with armed suspects inside.<eos> He ordered the FD not to approach the building.<eos> But they engaged the fire anyway.<eos> Suspects started shooting, we were force to return fire, and all hell broke loose.<eos> That's when I got hit.<eos> Thank you, Derek.<eos> Good work today.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Those sons of bitches need to pay for this.<eos> Somebody does.
Probably.<eos> - Are you on any medication?<eos> - Warfarin.<eos> I've got atrial fibrillation.<eos> You should know warfarin is an anticoagulant.<eos> That's why your blood isn't clotting.<eos> Morwenna!<eos> Your heartbeat is very irregular.<eos> Last month, the specialist gave my heart an electric shock to fix it.<eos> Well, it didn't.
But after the government's Precrime program was shut down, they were finally released.<eos> They kept themselves safe and hidden from the world, until now.<eos> - No, I was just, um...<eos> Obsessing over your father's case files?<eos> It's just, there's nothing in any of these about the blind drug dealer Dina Winter talked about, Lycon.<eos> Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
We call that an eyewitness.<eos> So you're in your bedroom.<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> Can you tell what time it is?<eos> I heard a whip-poor-will.<eos> It's a local bird that makes its call<eos> - just around sunset.<eos> - That gives us until tomorrow night, at least.<eos> - Or it already happened.<eos> - It didn't.
Maybe our government, maybe another.<eos> We're always gonna be hunted.<eos> I'd prefer that wasn't the case.<eos> You?<eos> I'd keep it.<eos> Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
We all forget.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Good-bye, Brian.<eos> So when are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - About what?<eos> - Your vision.<eos> The one that has you so upset.<eos> Maybe it's a misunderstanding.<eos> - That's not how these things work.<eos> - So how do they?
You want me to punch you, right?<eos> I have business to attend to.<eos> More fun with wind farms.<eos> Was that a good call or a bad one?<eos> Father should start packing his bags.<eos> I hope the two of you haven't been waiting long.<eos> We were well attended to.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was worried something happened when you left so suddenly the other night.<eos> Something did.
That's my dad's fridge.<eos> Not any more, it isn't.<eos> Didn't he tell you?<eos> He's gone bust, handed it all over.<eos> Give us a hand, will you? Thing weighs a ton.<eos> Yeah, thanks for the help, then!<eos> In here, Doc.<eos> It's like fate, our paths crossing like this.<eos> - Makes you think, doesn't it.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Vega!<eos> It was you.<eos> That night weighs on her... still.<eos> And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right.<eos> But... she kept trying.<eos> Keeps trying.<eos> You got to turn your life around.<eos> Because you got to have one.<eos> You got to live.<eos> He didn't.
Oh, that's a shame because my house-flipping business is gonna take the world by storm.<eos> All right? It's gonna be a TV show.<eos> Me and Monte take over the world.<eos> That's all he said? Yeah.<eos> The mere fact that Chad Brunson got the names of the team members responsible for taking down his brother-- it's troubling.<eos> Well, if that information came from inside NCIS, it's more than just troubling.<eos> - Oh, of course, I agree.<eos> - There's a good chance the mole we apprehended last year gave up this information before we got him.<eos> And we still don't know who he was working for?<eos> We don't.
Um... - what do you mean?<eos> - I mean I called the art restoration lab at Columbia, we got one of your neighbors to let us into your apartment building, and we took an X-ray of the wall.<eos> Oh, my God, it's gonna be beautiful when they uncover it.<eos> Because that will make your building a historical landmark, and they cannot tear it down.<eos> Oh, my God! This is amazing.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> It was one of those moments when it felt like it was all right there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I want this.<eos> Shauna, I do.
You did a decent job on those files.<eos> I've been handed loads of bollocks in my day.<eos> Yours is truly a cut above.<eos> I want the real files, Brian.<eos> And I want them tomorrow.<eos> That nurse.<eos> You said she was gonna take care of my dad, not make him sick.<eos> Don't blame Sipiwe, mate.<eos> Forget her anyway. She's gone.<eos> Sipiwe didn't do anything.
I mean, I'm still working temp jobs.<eos> I should have gone to law school, like you. Instead, I went to Colosseum... worst educational experience ever.<eos> But I can pay you a bit every month.<eos> Bob Bondi, please.<eos> Oh, you won't get him at work.<eos> I'm not calling him at work.<eos> Hi, is this Mrs. Bondi?<eos> Hi. I work with your husband, do... do you mind getting him for me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bob. Hey, how you doing?
I mean, a feeling so bad that it's got to mean something.<eos> Something bad. No!<eos> Please!<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I didn't do anything to you!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> I don't want to die!<eos> Shut up! ♪ ♪ You know who this is?<eos> No, I don't.
In my trash at home.<eos> I threw it away right before, uh...<eos> (sighs) Right before I tried to kill myself.<eos> Tamara was my whole reason for living.<eos> I could never hurt her. When she broke up with me,<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Five weeks ago, we had a blow-out.<eos> She went to Hong Kong to visit one of her friends.<eos> Um, I thought that she would just cool off and come back like she always did.<eos> But she didn't.
Have you seen this girl?<eos> WOMAN: No. Sorry.<eos> No?<eos> What about you, Mod Squad?<eos> How about you guys, have you seen this girl?<eos> YOUNG MAN: Hey, your costume's really cute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I made it myself. Nice.<eos> YOUNG MAN: So how do you know Dave?<eos> I don't.
So you have to do the opposite and not let Dean know that I know he knows.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - Got it.<eos> - All right, good, good.<eos> I'm not gonna repeat it back to you, but I got it.<eos> I think I would feel better if you just said it once back to me that it was clear.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna be you and repeat it back to you.<eos> No, don't just repeat my words, say it in your own words, so I know that you got the message.<eos> But if I do it as me, then all the...
Yeah, a whole lot of blood.<eos> We took a look at your car, Nina.<eos> And we found Nesbit's blood in the back of it.<eos> So that's not proof I'm a murderer.<eos> Also did some digging.<eos> Turns out that you grew up down the road from the fish farm where Nesbit's body was dumped.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So I threw his body in the pond, but after his organs were properly distributed.<eos> Are you still claiming that you didn't kill him?<eos> Of course I didn't.
Wherever you are.<eos> That may be difficult. I'm going to Syria.<eos> But you could send it to this address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for coming. Of course.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So should I say it now or later?<eos> Fine. You told me so.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Business of war. Fancy new jet comes with agendas.<eos> Multimillion-dollar toy gets a glitch, now, that's a problem.<eos> But... something wrong with the pilot? That they can live with.<eos> My job here is just... is simply to find the truth.<eos> The truth... is my daughter was an exemplary pilot, as competent and capable as anyone out there, any age, male or female.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Doc Wade.<eos> Says she got something.<eos> Upon examining the victim, I found several traumatic injuries, but it's likely the fatal blow was to the skull.<eos> Hey, Danny, how you doing?
I don't need this.<eos> I'm quitting the band!<eos> Fine, I quit, too! Then get out of my house!<eos> With pleasure!<eos> Raj, wait.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
Oh, Alice, thank you so much for your help.<eos> My pleasure, Mr. Solano.<eos> I could talk about coastal erosion all day. All right, bye-bye.<eos> We are not bidding.<eos> What?<eos> Lachlan altered the geological report.<eos> I just sweet-talked the secretary to fax over the original.<eos> Yes, that's what Scott just told me.<eos> - But how's that possible? - What? Um, have you, uh, had a chance to glance at his résumé yet?<eos> Uh... yeah, I did.
You really want to do this again?<eos> No, I-it's streptococcus pyogenes.<eos> We use that and e.<eos> Coli in the perfume-making process.<eos> So, you admit to working with the exact stuff that infected Gigi.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Rosie, I think we're gonna nail Ian.<eos> He had access to the bacteria that's used in...<eos> - Perfume, yeah, I know.<eos> - Of course you do.
_ _ _<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I am not.<eos> I have the fever.<eos> The mark of death.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I am here.<eos> You know what my name means?<eos> Tisquantum?<eos> I do not.
And I you, Son.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Your mother missed you terribly.<eos> She spoke of you every day, and she wondered how fast you were growing up.<eos> What you were doing that very moment in Holland.<eos> She was counting the days until she would see you again.<eos> Come.<eos> Do you remember her?<eos> You were very young, 'tis alright if you don't.<eos> I do, a little.
This is gonna take some time and finesse.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Unless you're having one at the far end of the bar, you need to leave.<eos> Quote... "Villa needs her space right now."<eos> Pippy said that.<eos> And I agree.<eos> You spoke to your sister about our situation?<eos> Well, I had to.<eos> I can't talk to you about it till after the case is over, remember?<eos> I do.
When Killer Joe wasn't pushing women off balconies, he installed car stereos.<eos> We need to drop by his job and see if we can establish how Terrence came to hire him.<eos> Or how Vaughn came to hire him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you had no idea Joe was mixed up in anything illegal?<eos> No.<eos> You recognize either of these guys?<eos> Either one bring their cars in?<eos> - No. - Nuh-uh.<eos> Joe did a huge install for some mystery guy at his house, though.
I promise I won't take it out until it's roadworthy.<eos> Save you the bother of towing me away.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Straight back, though.<eos> And let this be a lesson to you.<eos> Thank you... Officer.<eos> - Impressive.<eos> - The iron fist of the law has a soft centre.<eos> Give us a go on your gun.<eos> What do I do?
Well, you and Laura think that Isabel's alive, then find her and keep her safe.<eos> Tell me more about Isabel.<eos> I was hired to help her navigate through the shark-infested waters of the Greenwich social circle.<eos> But to be honest, I couldn't help much.<eos> Why not?<eos> The ladies who lunge are super judgy.<eos> The boss gave Isabel an unlimited budget for clothes.<eos> I took her to fashion week, introduced her to designers, but she was more into jeans and t-shirts.<eos> - I approve.<eos> - Mr. Van Doren didn't.
He said, Claire asked for a divorce in the same room and look what happened to her.<eos> Pretty close to admitting he had committed a murder.<eos> That's when I knew I had to go.<eos> But, I'd never pull off hiding from him.<eos> So, you had to be dead.<eos> You did a good job.<eos> The 911 called the DNA on the broken windshield.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I thought that would convince him.<eos> It did.
I imagine selling fantasies is a very profitable business, one you are clearly not profiting from.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The range rover in the driveway, those diamond earrings, your shoes-- your aspirations clearly exceed your reality.<eos> I've been preparing to quit.<eos> I have more than enough money.<eos> Oh. Lies on top of pretense, my dear.<eos> You haven't quit because you enjoy the power.<eos> There's no shame in that.<eos> Do I look ashamed?<eos> No, you do not.
I was hoping you would.<eos> I can't believe you came back.<eos> Of course I came back.<eos> As soon as I heard, I came back.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You had a plan.<eos> The boat...<eos> I wish you would have come with me.<eos> I know you went to Ressler and offered to help.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sour cream and onion Pringle?<eos> They're shaped like the human tongue.<eos> I'm fine, thank you.<eos> Sometimes I lick the coating off - and then throw the rest away.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Keep it moving, son.<eos> - Keep it moving.<eos> - Do you sometimes see numbers as colors?<eos> - What?<eos> - I do.
- Yeah, I have Yolanda, okay? Huh?<eos> You de Yolandee?<eos> Yo de Yolandee.<eos> Oh, now the guy with the funny accent has Yolanda? - H-unh!<eos> - I have Yolanda.<eos> I got her slippers with headlights so she can have her midnight snack in safety.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, raise your hand if you have Yolanda.<eos> I did.
It's, um...<eos> Oh gee, this is awkward.<eos> Uh, I mean you're the last person...<eos> Quit sputtering and muttering and stammering and boring me.<eos> Just spit it out, frog.<eos> Can you give us a minute, Deadly?<eos> Kermit.<eos> You seem to be under the false impression that I want to be in this room.<eos> - Huh? - You don't know me.<eos> No one does. [Shudders]
Okay.<eos> Hi, Chelsea?<eos> I was in earlier, wearing the green jacket that's louder than that guy laughing at his own screenplay?<eos> She's laughing!<eos> I would like to take you out for coffee sometime, maybe at a place you don't have to make it?<eos> Great.<eos> O-okay, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye.<eos> She said yes.<eos> Of course she did.
Do you believe she's innocent?<eos> My job isn't to determine her guilt or innocence.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> My job is to apprehend Ms. Keen, and I have no problem doing that.<eos> I'm not asking about your job.<eos> I'm asking what you believe.<eos> Elizabeth Keen is not a terrorist.<eos> So you believe she's innocent?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I thought...<eos> I have good news.<eos> Dembe made contact.<eos> You spoke to him?<eos> No, we have a protocol.<eos> He initiated it.<eos> We meet him later today.<eos> In the meantime, Aram gave me a name, a gunsmith who makes Wendigo's weapons.<eos> The feds don't know how to find him.<eos> But I do.
I thought you were great.<eos> Maybe I could talk to him.<eos> Look, Gavin.<eos> Mr. Delgado, we both know you can take that site down.<eos> I don't choose who deserves to die.<eos> The masses do.<eos> No Capitol Hill, no committees, no debates.<eos> I've created the purest form of democracy. By dispersing power directly into the hands of the people, no single person possesses the ability to tip the scales.<eos> I don't choose targets.<eos> The people do.
I'm so sorry, but I had nothing to do...<eos> You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> It's understandable that you would think she did, but she didn't.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.<eos> My mom was innocent.<eos> I lost my mom when I was a little girl.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> You don't.
What big ideas?<eos> Your idea to revamp the store.<eos> Shake things up a little bit.<eos> This guy, he doesn't want to just organize the store by product type.<eos> He wants to organize the store by lifestyle.<eos> There would be an aisle for single moms,.<eos> There would be an aisle for veterans.<eos> That's actually... pretty cool.<eos> No, Glenn has... all kinds of great ideas just like that one.<eos> You do?

We must recast.<eos> But it's Make Love Week.<eos> Fans will want to see someone spectacular in bed with me.<eos> Salma, Penelope, J. Lo.<eos> Rogelio, be realistic.<eos> You're right... younger.<eos> Selena, Demi, Emma Stone.<eos> I heard she can play any race.<eos> - Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.

Lo.<eos> Rogelio, be realistic.<eos> You're right... younger.<eos> Selena, Demi, Emma Stone.<eos> I heard she can play any race.<eos> - Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Her agent said she's willing to screen test.<eos> - I-I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You do.

And when it happened with you, well, I pretty much did everything wrong, 'cause I just tried to ignore it... instead of embracing it.<eos> So that's my advice to you. There's a baby coming.<eos> Whatever that means to you, embrace it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay, Mateo's down.<eos> let's talk about Petra.<eos> I mean, if you still want to.<eos> No, yes, of course I do.
He didn't talk.<eos> He just laughed.<eos> And there was music.<eos> Can you remember what kind of music it was?<eos> Classical.<eos> Classical. Okay.<eos> It was like... he did it to set a mood.<eos> He was into it.<eos> I've read about these women, and I know I'm supposed to feel lucky that I survived.<eos> But I don't.
I'm Adam.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Look, I don't know what to say here.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He trusted you.<eos> - Hey, you Ben Forsick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How do you know Roxy Richards?<eos> - I don't.
Why are you doing this? Where's the tattoo?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Did you burn it off?<eos> I never had any tattoo!<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> I think you have the wrong person.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> No, no, no, please don't do this!<eos> Please don't do this!<eos> Please don't do this!
You want something from me, take it.<eos> Be the aggressor.<eos> I think you'll quite like it.<eos> I think it would make me feel a bit...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Masculine.<eos> A bit like a working girl even.<eos> After a long day of cajoling other nobles, taking what I can, building our fortune...<eos> I come home to you exhausted, Lola, and it would be nice to know, on occasion, that you want me as much as I want you.<eos> I do.
Don't you think I know that?<eos> Did you think I'd let you run away from me?<eos> Recommit to your wife without explanation?<eos> Just let us go, Elizabeth.<eos> Release Amy.<eos> I was ready to tell you Don Carlos is gone, that I will never marry.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted, too.<eos> What did Amy do to change your mind?<eos> - She knows about us.<eos> - Of course she does.
Have fun sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic.<eos> Okay, see, joke's on you, my brother, because I am taking the subway straight to Santa Monica.<eos> Subway? That's another reason not to go.<eos> Can't believe the school is making us take the children to the museum on a Saturday.<eos> I know.<eos> Lost weekend, right?<eos> No.<eos> It's just...<eos> Tyler's almost a pre-Eagle Scout and there's an event today.<eos> Does Ralph do Scouts?
Where all body art will be on full display.<eos> If one of them has that tattoo...<eos> Then we can bring them in.<eos> I just need a partner to go with me into the women's locker room.<eos> A female partner, guys.<eos> So, I got the paperwork for the painting all figured out.<eos> I just need your signature, and then I'll be on my...<eos> What?<eos> You look a little stressed.<eos> No, I don't.
Uh-huh.<eos> Uh-huh!<eos> No, that's good.<eos> That's all I need. Thank you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - What?<eos> Turns out George is involved in a power struggle over the Keller empire with present C.E.O. Penelope Keller.<eos> His mother, right?<eos> She founded the company.<eos> Yes, she did.
First, Alan York, the astronaut, went missing.<eos> Then, there was Tim Addis, heir to the Addis timber fortune.<eos> Followed closely by Colin Andrews, a tech pioneer who was last seen jogging in Seward Park.<eos> We want a download on Terrence Fowler.<eos> I understand he's missing now, and he fits the profile.<eos> Fowler's wife, Taylor, was a murder-for-hire.<eos> I figured he took off, given the suspicion that he was somehow involved. But my APB got no hits.<eos> I'd like to take a look at anything you have on him.<eos> - If you don't mind.<eos> - He doesn't.
Sorry, guys.<eos> - Hi, I'm Steph.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Peyton.<eos> So, uh, what's with the, uh suitcases?<eos> Is, uh, everything okay?<eos> It was until you just asked that.<eos> Wait, did Major not tell you?<eos> He said I could crash here until my new place is ready.<eos> He did not.
So it's all over?<eos> Yeah, everything wil be fine.<eos> I put you through so much.<eos> You had a big day too.<eos> You were great, Mr. KOH.<eos> Honey, is it raining there too?<eos> It rained on the day you proposed to me.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Of course I do.
When you live in Britain and you play music, especially when you play acoustic guitar and you start off in a pub circuit, your dreams don't really stretch that far.<eos> Your dreams, like my dream, was to play Shepherd's Bush Empire, which is 1,500 capacity.<eos> And that was the ultimate.<eos> The Shepherd's Bush Empire, I've been waiting to do this gig for years.<eos> I'm very happy to be here.<eos> I never aspired to play Wembley until last year.<eos> And it was my birthday wish when I cut my cake.<eos> Can I tell you a little secret?<eos> Every wish I've made in the last five years has come true.<eos> Not to do three, just to do one.
See, just like that.<eos> You've been married for over 45 years.<eos> Have you ever said anything to your wife that you truly regretted?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> "Will you marry me ?",<eos> "I love you," shit like that.<eos> Come on, when your wife is a romantic mood, do you ever think about taking one of those little pills?<eos> Cyanide?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I do actually.
Peanut, one of my other characters, he had a Little Jeff and he did a show with him.<eos> He had his voice for Little Jeff, but I have to come up with my own voice for him.<eos> Because I can't do the same voices that Peanut does.<eos> Thank you for getting that joke.<eos> I promise you there have been a handful of audiences<eos> I've done that joke, and they don't get it.<eos> They sit there and look at each other and go,<eos> "Oh, yeah, you can't do the same voice Peanut can.<eos> Can't do it, so..."<eos> How you doing, Little Jeff?
Is there anyone you would like us to contact?<eos> His mother?<eos> She... she's gone.<eos> No!<eos> My... my boy!<eos> We brought you some clean clothes to change into.<eos> And then we'll take you to your son.<eos> What'd you do, Vic?<eos> I'd like to tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
What is this? What...<eos> Wait. Just wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think this is one of those things.<eos> "Cop shoots an unarmed man" kind of thing?<eos> Because my partner and I got bullet holes in us that tell a different story.<eos> Okay, settle down.<eos> I thought you and I had something<eos> - in the bank here, Leanne. - We do.<eos> We do. Dr. Rorish.
How's my partner doing?<eos> He's stable.<eos> And the kid that got hit by the stray?<eos> He's gonna pull through.<eos> And the shooter?<eos> You afraid of what he might say?<eos> Look, whatever you're thinking, whatever they're thinking out there, that's not it.<eos> I took money from a guy that you don't take money from.<eos> He said he would come for me.<eos> And he did.
Yeah.<eos> Something about... sending them off to live happily ever after.<eos> Alone and in peace.<eos> And what's the nonfiction?<eos> Can't say, Henry.<eos> You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
Who is this woman?<eos> It's not just that.<eos> Rowenna has... some emotional issues that go very, very deep.<eos> All right, obviously, I can't tell you many more details, but... the more I find out, the more it worries me.<eos> Worries you?<eos> Come round. Just come back to mine.<eos> My parents are gone all night.<eos> My mum would murder me.<eos> What, you... You don't want to?<eos> No, I do.
There's no point in thinking about that right now.<eos> We won't know until she wakes up if there's any lasting cognitive deficits, okay?<eos> Back to work.<eos> How is she?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Shahir hasn't given me an update yet.<eos> How are you?<eos> I cleared her for work, and I shouldn't have.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I saved the life of the guy who did this to her.<eos> It doesn't.
Your family is safe.<eos> That is also some kind of wonder, don't you think?<eos> We must help our brothers in City Hall, so that they could help us from the inside.<eos> So if City Hall does not surrender this night, we will come lo ask you for help.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Captain, will they relieve us tomorrow?<eos> If they don't, they'll take us out by helicopter.<eos> But our helicopters don't fly at night.<eos> American ones do.
I got a message to meet my handler here.<eos> I should have been suspicious.<eos> Called in a favor.<eos> I knew you wouldn't show otherwise.<eos> You're compromising my cover.<eos> Carmen, we need your help.<eos> I have enough problems.<eos> The Street Kings are looking for a snitch in their crew now.<eos> Paul knows someone planted that phone in his car.<eos> Someone did.
Look at him.<eos> How would you describe your experience?<eos> Traumatizing.<eos> The sex started out pleasant enough, but then things escalated and it got rough.<eos> - And now the fun begins. - How so?<eos> She held me down and even choked me at one point.<eos> He asked for that.<eos> So Ms. Randolph put her own sexual desires before your safety...<eos> - Objection, counsel is testifying.<eos> - Just like she did
Hill and Secretary McCord were natural allies.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Uh... yes, please.<eos> With the admiral gone, there's room for a new voice that comports with POTUS's better instincts.<eos> Meaning yours.<eos> Yours, too.<eos> That little Cuba stunt notwithstanding.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Sure you do.
Mike Barnow?<eos> And his stupid dog.<eos> My assistant's allergic...<eos> it caused a hell of a...<eos> What did he want?<eos> Copies of my official schedule from last week, when we were meeting about the whole...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Not here.<eos> I thought Russell Jackson had her under control.<eos> He does.
Give me this yearbook and I'm gonna pick one for him.<eos> No. Even if I did think that was a good idea, I'm not gonna abuse my position of power in the school.<eos> You share an office with a tetherball.<eos> You have to just let nature take its course, just like this webcam I've been watching.<eos> It's a live stream of wild otters.<eos> I forget, is it the small hairy men or the tall not hairy men?<eos> Small hairy, but these are actual otters. Look.<eos> See, this mama otter just gave birth to twins.<eos> Now, the little one, he's struggling, but do you see the mama doting on him?<eos> No, you do not.
I have a client who I thought was a drug designer.<eos> But I think he's an FBI informant.<eos> As part of his defense, I was walking him through a few different case scenarios.<eos> I explained the implications of each and I let him decide how he wanted to testify.<eos> Is that a lawyerly way of saying you helped him lie?<eos> But it could be interpreted that way.<eos> What are you thinking? Enemies of Peter?<eos> Or you.<eos> It's a primary. - Anything could happen.<eos> - So what do I do?
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But -- no, you looked at Sam like -- you guys know what's wrong with me. Hey!<eos> You don't have a soul, all right?<eos> Dean. You want to be a little more blunt?<eos> H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
Truth is...<eos> I don't know what's what.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, really?<eos> You ever hear of privacy?<eos> Hey, you want privacy, close your door.<eos> Thought we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did, Dean.
Been a crazy couple of days.<eos> Darn tootin'.<eos> But you've been great.<eos> I really appreciate all your hard work.<eos> And, uh...<eos> Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay. Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
How do we get our girl back?<eos> Somebody's say something.<eos> Someone's gotta say something.<eos> You know what?<eos> Is there a spare bedroom?<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, maybe Maddie can sleep there.<eos> That should help.<eos> It's on her face.<eos> And a hot shower does wonders.
I mean, from here.<eos> All this.<eos> The hunting life.<eos> Do you?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Ever think...<eos> That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Wait. So only dead people get to see him?<eos> And this makes sense to billions of you?<eos> It is the nature of faith.<eos> It's -- it's all here.<eos> The mercy of God, his love the world and mankind, his -- his perfect plan for us.<eos> Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
This ghastly force set free when the Mark was removed.<eos> So you know.<eos> I've heard whispers.<eos> As bad as they say?<eos> Well, let's just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.<eos> None of us do.
Then will you fight with me to make that happen?<eos> What about you?<eos> Would you sacrifice your people to Gwi?<eos> Wouldn't that make Gwi the real king?<eos> Do you fight for the people? Of course!<eos> Then would you be willing to abdicate as king?<eos> I would lay down my life.<eos> How'd you get this?<eos> I apologize for the Queen.<eos> She did it for me.
You throw a rock in there, you're gonna hit somebody willing to pull a trigger for that price.<eos> Find this guy.<eos> Ethan, um...<eos> I got to go, but your mom's on her way in.<eos> Okay?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> She does.
- It's fine. I just need to know.<eos> Oh, you don't think you deserved my piling my service on you.<eos> - No.<eos> - I believe you do.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm gonna let you in on a secret.<eos> See, when Webber had this job, it was easier for him.<eos> And Hunt had it easier than I do.<eos> You know why?<eos> - I don't.
Negotiators who have been working here all week are said to have just a few final details to iron out.<eos> If true, Presidents Grant and Razani would sign their names to the biggest push for peace since the toppling of the Berlin Wall.<eos> The Bandaris have assured me a thousand times Olivia Pope is not a problem.<eos> She slithered into the bed of a married man. She's unclean.<eos> She's a whore. You don't receive a whore.<eos> You married one.<eos> Very different situation.<eos> They won't receive her.<eos> It's never going to happen.<eos> It just did.
She got this side of you. She did this part.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> I didn't have to be everything.<eos> You could've had something...<eos> Been something.<eos> Mellie... that's what she said.<eos> I hate that you're always right.<eos> Me too.<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
Hornet.<eos> Most people aren't aware there are multiple Darknets.<eos> Tor network is just one of them.<eos> There are over two million users on Tor, which is slowing it down, making it too vulnerable.<eos> A lot of operations are jumping ship to other darknets, like Hornet.<eos> You think Libertad will?<eos> Probably.<eos> But I bet Giuseppe Montolo's hit men have already moved.<eos> You're here because you think we have undercover access to a Hornet router.<eos> Do you?
Instead of looking for Montolo's hit men, have you tried looking for the Dirty Dozen?<eos> Did Axelrod tell you about that?<eos> Aren't we all sharing information here?<eos> Simon Kahn, our C.I., is dead.<eos> His car exploded outside his apartment.<eos> He was coming to meet me.<eos> John?<eos> He...didn't kill me.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Yes, he did.
It's different for us... the clergy.<eos> People put their trust in us... their faith.<eos> We break that trust, it stays broken.<eos> I can't believe that.<eos> You know who you are.<eos> You can stand up to them and have faith in that... have faith in yourself.<eos> I have to believe that.<eos> They say he doesn't give you more than you can handle.<eos> You say that, actually.<eos> Yes, I do.
I cheated on Adele.<eos> And I had a daughter.<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> Adele never told Lois or anyone about the affair.<eos> She never bashed me to her family.<eos> She lived with that pain and embarrassment for years... alone.<eos> She protected me, and I'm ashamed of that.<eos> It was a mess. I made a mess.<eos> And for as much pain as I caused and felt, I would have never believed that anything good would have come of it.<eos> But it did.
Then we move to that "X."<eos> Wait, you're not blindly following a bunch of riddles in her tattoos?<eos> And you don't even know who put them on her body?<eos> They're at the oil derricks.<eos> Hey, stay off the radio, man!<eos> They tracked us through the woods?<eos> No.<eos> They're tracking him. How?<eos> I thought you frisked him. Stand up.<eos> I did. But not for a tracker.
- Ah!<eos> You didn't know.<eos> - And where is it?<eos> It went to change a tire.<eos> A tire blew up.<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> I'm going to be a goalkeeper.<eos> OK, Dad?<eos> - No, I don't want that.<eos> - But I do.
Got hidden treasure in town?<eos> Treasure?<eos> That's silly!<eos> Good night.<eos> What did you say?<eos> What?<eos> Don't make me say it twice.<eos> Why do such a thing?<eos> We picked up his trail.<eos> Why do that?
Well, now we've got real work. Follow me.<eos> Now.<eos> We have until 5:00 P.M. to get the aunt's testimony thrown out.<eos> Her eyewitness account is the only thing that places Caleb and Catherine at the murder scene, and since the police never found a gun, she's the strongest evidence that the D.A.'s got.<eos> But she's dead.<eos> Which damns our clients even more.<eos> So comb through this discovery.<eos> Find proof that she lied about what she saw.<eos> How do you know she lied?<eos> I don't.
Well, stop.<eos> I talked to Nate, and he promised he was gonna look into him.<eos> And you think your cop buddy's<eos> - gonna handle this the right way?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Not for sure, at least.<eos> That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.<eos> I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
I have some news for you about Lillian.<eos> May I visit?<eos> See you shortly.<eos> Sorry to intrude, Ms. Grace.<eos> I couldn't help but hear that you were in the hall.<eos> - How can I help you, Mr. Miles?<eos> - Your friend forgot this.<eos> It had fallen behind the dresser.<eos> Not sure if it means anything to you.<eos> It does.
- Was there anyone else in the morgue when you left?<eos> The morgue attendant, possibly.<eos> Bring him to me.<eos> I'd like to interview him personally.<eos> This is exactly the same rocket as the one we built.<eos> I was hoping to determine its range from these diagrams.<eos> Oh, if we know exact mass, we can solve for distance - using my father's equation.<eos> - Well, the plan calls for 200 pounds of TNT.<eos> I don't know the tare weight of the rocket.<eos> I do.
Do you wanna go talk about that pier deal?<eos> sure. - Yeah?<eos> Shit.<eos> yourself.<eos> Good job today.<eos> You handled Danny's introduction to the world with real class.<eos> I couldn't have done it better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are you gonna do about that reporter?<eos> she will.
Yeah, uh, look, I know everyone is probably looking forward to my world-famous pasta salad but I won't be able to make it.<eos> So I invite you to my party, and you're not gonna bring anything?<eos> I won't be able to attend the barbeque... pasta salad's already made.<eos> Okay, no worries, pal, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Well, yeah... Hello?<eos> Steve?<eos> I believe he hung up.<eos> That's terrible, because if he's not gonna come to us, now we gotta go to him which means you need to tell us where he is.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
What does that mean?<eos> All three started off as your mother's right hand before being promoted.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I'm gonna do what every girl dreams of doing at one point or another...<eos> I'm going to kill my mother.<eos> You couldn't have stopped Ben from taking that deal?<eos> It was his decision.<eos> And it's not my case anymore... because I got promoted this morning.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> We will.
According to tommy, You were quite the little cheerleader in high school.<eos> Head cheerleader...<eos> At least she was before she got herself suspended.<eos> Can you put my brother back on the phone, please?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What did you get suspended for?<eos> Just put him on the phone.<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tommy, no, you won't.
How'd she die?<eos> Murdered.<eos> Tip?<eos> Tip. Have you decided what you want to do?<eos> You mean about waking up a girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is there something I can do?<eos> If there is, then please tell me.<eos> Do you want to turn around and go home?<eos> 'Cause we will.
Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality.<eos> And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.<eos> He said it upset you and that you're not saying much about him.<eos> Yeah, it's very complicated, so...<eos> He said that be aware that if we're talking to my mom about my dad, that she's gonna get a funny look on her face.<eos> So I take it that Ziggy's father isn't exactly a good guy.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.<eos> Yeah, no, he never will.
How many miles is it from here?<eos> I've only been on three other dates from the computer.<eos> I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you... I'm glad my kids forced me into getting on that stupid thing.<eos> You... like me?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I want to see you again.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, w-we can wait and do it then.<eos> We will.
A car for the night, with a driver? We're talking probably $500, probably more.<eos> - Why don't you take the Jeep?<eos> - The Jeep is a hundred years old.<eos> The Jeep's not a hundred years old.<eos> It's not even paid off yet. Why don't you take the station wagon?<eos> 'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.<eos> Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.<eos> Mom, it's high school.<eos> Of course they will.
I had the ringer off.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You were supposed to relieve the sitter.<eos> I had parent conferences today.<eos> She left the house a mess.<eos> First time in two hours this baby's stopped crying.<eos> - I'm afraid to put him down.<eos> - I'll take him.<eos> - If he gets upset again...<eos> - He won't.
But she said they were at the boat, so I hoped...<eos> No. You didn't just hope.<eos> You got us here.<eos> I was beginning to lose faith.<eos> But then I saw you. And you nodded at me.<eos> I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave, that you searched and found me, that you, seeing these numbers, you seemed so...<eos> We will set things right.<eos> But things are gonna get very hard before that time.<eos> We have to hold on.<eos> I will.
I saw it.<eos> Daryl:<eos> What? That group. Um, the women I met.<eos> [Sighs] They have an armory.<eos> They have guns. Rick: Why didn't you tell us before now?<eos> I made a promise, Rick.<eos> ♪♪ Do you ever think about who you've killed?<eos> ♪♪ Yeah.<eos> ♪♪ Rick: Are you ready if this goes south?<eos> It won't.
It's Eugene. Word in the halls is that you're all-in with things here.<eos> It may not seem like it now, but I assure you, you, too, made the correct select.<eos> Sasha: I was wrong.<eos> Sasha: I can't.<eos> I won't.<eos> I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how I could, with what happened, with our friends still out there, still being hurt by them.<eos> I don't know how I could've said that.<eos> And now... I am trapped.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I will.
Thanks, Dad.<eos> - I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Nate came home early.<eos> His fight fell apart.<eos> Shit. That sucks.<eos> Hey. Can I hold her?<eos> We can't fall asleep with her.<eos> I won't.
No, Kevin.<eos> That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, uh, the beard looks good on you.<eos> Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.
That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, uh, the beard looks good on you.<eos> Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> The fuck I won't, John!
- I didn't do anything wrong. - I know. I know, I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You seem less than pleased. No.<eos> No, it's good.<eos> It's a... it's a happy ending.<eos> I'm just wondering how the hell you pulled it off.<eos> It's better you don't know. Trust me.<eos> As long as this doesn't come back and bite us in the ass.<eos> - It won't.
She's winning the argument.<eos> She's a Gold Star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> At lea... for now she is.<eos> ...on the ground, so we're talking... Did you know Javadi's in town?<eos> I was alerted the minute he boarded the plane in Tehran.<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about it?<eos> He and Saul cannot meet.<eos> Otherwise, everything unravels.<eos> They won't.
Yes.<eos> And my mujahideen killed them in return.<eos> Didn't kill my husband, though.<eos> You're gonna need to take your shirt off.<eos> And there's been a major explosion on the George Washington Bridge heading into Manhattan, and we have reports of many fatalities...<eos> Horrifying, isn't it?<eos> But based on the images we have seen so far, we can speculate that the number of fatalities could easily be within the 100 range... Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.
It's easy with you.<eos> You're artistic.<eos> Oh, I know she is, just from being in her shop.<eos> Uh... our shop.<eos> Yes, of course, Sam.<eos> It's just, you're never there.<eos> Well, my business is in Seattle.<eos> It wasn't my idea to move, but we're getting it figured out.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
Our church is very inclusive of women.<eos> Um, now, I have some exciting news.<eos> The bishop himself will be at our church next Sunday.<eos> He would be more than happy to perform the ceremony.<eos> Kathryn: Amazing!<eos> This is a really big deal, Lily.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Will next Sunday work?<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There is a part of me, though, that, wants to say I'm sorry.<eos> To whom?<eos> Well, to the only person I know who uses "Whom" in a conversation.<eos> Sorry to me?<eos> For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.
Yeah.<eos> Look, I wasn't just coming back for the money.<eos> I had to try.<eos> I know.<eos> And once I'm gone, I can't come back.<eos> I understand.<eos> I hope you do too.<eos> It's gonna take 48 hours for us to get our new passports.<eos> I'll be at the Platte City Motel out by the airport... if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Um.<eos> Okay, then, thanks.<eos> I gotta get back to it.<eos> How 'bout we call it a day?<eos> I'll buy you some dinner.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> You realize how far behind I am? Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up.<eos> Whaddya talking about?<eos> I'll do the wills. - No, you won't.<eos> - 'Course I will.
- Hey.<eos> - I lost him.<eos> He turned down an alley.<eos> He's gone. Go to Annalise's.<eos> He probably thinks she's there.<eos> - I'll go to his apartment.<eos> - Got it. - Frank.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do not hurt him.<eos> - I won't.
I don't know what else to do.<eos> I'm not good at building shit, you know?<eos> I'm excellent at tearing it down.<eos> Oh, rookie move.<eos> What... the... - It's already cheese.<eos> - It's cheese on cheese.<eos> See?<eos> You know, sometimes, you got to play to your strengths.<eos> You should stitch that on a pillow.<eos> Oh, I will.
It's not safe for a Shadowhunter to be at the DuMort right now.<eos> Especially one looking for vampire venom.<eos> Raphael, I think... if I can have a small bite, over time I can have less and less.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well... we can manage it... together.<eos> You really should go.<eos> Wait. OK.<eos> What... what do you want from me?<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll...
So that changes things, right?<eos> I mean, since Iris didn't die, future me never goes down that same dark path.<eos> I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.<eos> And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him.<eos> He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
Hi! You wrote about my...<eos> You wrote about me on Twitter?<eos> I just heard a couple of kids trying to figure out who was pregnant in our class.<eos> Luckily for me, Natalie put on a few pounds this year.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> To me?<eos> To Jesus?<eos> - No one knows it was me.<eos> - I do!<eos> And Jesus will.
There's about to be a vote, so it's time to play hardball.<eos> This isn't hardball.<eos> This is cruel.<eos> What would be cruel is the people of the city not having you as the mayor.<eos> The Anti-Crime unit, low-income housing, common-sense gun legislation...<eos> Ollie, in the short amount of time you've been doing this, you've done a remarkable job.<eos> Please just let me do what I have to do to help you keep doing that.<eos> Felicity told me about this Kullens thing because of something that John said to her.<eos> Thea, when you fight fire with fire, you are probably gonna get burned.<eos> I won't.
I made sure to set aside a successful batch.<eos> This place gives me the creeps.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He will.
Come on, Barry, get up.<eos> All my days, this is quite the reversal of our fortune.<eos> Reversal...<eos> Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!
- And Snart.<eos> All to teach me another lesson.<eos> Which was what?<eos> Saving Iris is my responsibility and mine alone.<eos> It's why the Speed Force didn't let me take Wally's place, why Jay sacrificed himself to do it.<eos> So I could finish this.<eos> Jay, hero among heroes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can't just leave him in there.<eos> We won't.
Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Same as you.<eos> The future.<eos> And my dad.<eos> What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.
But that's got all her information on it.<eos> Maybe when you go back, you can find her and... I don't know, she can decipher it for you.<eos> I hope so.<eos> But if not... just make some good memories with Iris.<eos> Hold onto 'em as tight as you can.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
I drive fast.<eos> Long time since you've been in the field, huh?<eos> I mean, if you need to head back...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> All right, so we got what?<eos> An hour till dark?<eos> Which puts us at six hours till midnight?<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> Dean, we gotta talk about this.<eos> Okay, we will.
I couldn't kill Dagon back there.<eos> I lost two of my men.<eos> I betrayed my friends, my family.<eos> Before all this happened, I was a cut-rate political flack in an embarrassingly unprofessional relationship with my boss.<eos> I don't know why it's me.<eos> And I don't know why it's you.<eos> But I know that we are destined for something here.<eos> Something great.<eos> Well, I wish I had your faith.<eos> You will.
Probably, yeah.<eos> 'Cause I'm, big-hearted.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Nice.<eos> - You're sweet.<eos> Not a very good liar, but thanks.<eos> It's all about the light.<eos> The right light will hide a multitude of sins.<eos> Leave my card here on the table. If he shows.<eos> He won't.
Right, but in combat situation...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I should be thanking you.<eos> I don't really have too many friends.<eos> I've been told I'm obnoxious.<eos> But today, I felt...<eos> I felt electric.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't.
Two weeks later, he calls me, middle of the night, and he says we have to talk.<eos> He never shows, and I never see him again.<eos> I believe Scottie ordered him disappeared.<eos> How do you know it was her?<eos> We have our reasons.<eos> For starters, that's when she began her campaign to marginalize me... push me out of my own company, convince the board that I was unstable and had to be sidelined.<eos> And when that didn't work, she tried to have me killed... all to keep me from learning the truth about Whitehall.<eos> And you think she's gonna tell me?<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> She will.
- The drive-in with Fred Andrews?<eos> - Yes. An attractive woman going with an old friend is less conspicuous than an old crone going alone.<eos> You're not an old crone, Ms. Hermione.<eos> Of course not.<eos> That was a joke.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is my daughter is hiding a gun in her bedroom, and that's just for starters.<eos> - I can explain...<eos> - Oh, you will.
Which is something I think we could all use right about now.<eos> You'll help us, won't you?<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Blossom, may I have this first dance with Archie?<eos> I think that's an excellent idea.<eos> Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?<eos> Just keep dancing.<eos> And smiling.<eos> Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.<eos> As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.<eos> Yes, she will...
- Mm. - I respect you.<eos> I mean... President Grant is very...<eos> Attractive?<eos> Magnetic?<eos> - Charismatic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us. Nothing.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> And nothing ever will.
You know all about handling fraudulent activity, don't you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I know that you gave my dad the go-ahead on investing the school's endowment.<eos> We're talking about an entirely different matter here.<eos> This has nothing to do with that.<eos> Yeah. You're always gonna save yourself.<eos> Okay, Jason, this is highly inappropriate behavior right now.<eos> I'm just trying to help Mr. Smerconish here.<eos> I mean, if he really wants to save himself, he won't turn these quarters over to the police.<eos> Of course he will.
- You heard what happened.<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> They called Nolan.<eos> I want you to get Hudson and meet me.<eos> We'll get you underground.<eos> - What?<eos> - They're gonna come for you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They won't blame me for your bad choices.<eos> Of course they will.
I can take care of myself.<eos> Yeah, you're pretty resourceful.<eos> Well, in this family, it's... the only way to survive.<eos> Your room is pretty cute.<eos> You remember when you were asking me about my 11th birthday, and, uh, you told me that story about our drunk moms, and the cake falling on the floor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if you got that from Audrey, um, and I... you know, I went along with it because, uh... well, because the real story sucks.<eos> Maybe Audrey was trying to keep it from you, but...<eos> I won't.
Feed me, make my appointments, take care of the baby.<eos> Juliette, I want to.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your arms are getting strong.<eos> One of the perks of physical therapy.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
Well, that's just a piece of paper, though.<eos> That's true, but if he violates the terms, he's going to jail.<eos> And violating the terms means what, that he tries to come after me again?<eos> Ms. Jaymes, every one of us has been to Iraq, Afghanistan, and places you never heard of dealing with nasty, nasty characters.<eos> This man will not get to you.<eos> Oh, look at that beautiful leg.<eos> Looks like craters on the moon under that bandage.<eos> Well, better than steel rods sticking out.<eos> I still can't move my left leg.<eos> God, you will. Jeez.
Amazing.<eos> Really tight band, too.<eos> That drummer, Donny...<eos> McAllister, yeah.<eos> How long ago was that?<eos> Oh, this has got to be about eight years ago.<eos> - Huh. - MADDIE: There is no situation.<eos> You don't know the first thing about Clay or what he's really like.<eos> We'll talk about this later.<eos> No, we won't.
I listened.<eos> - Gunnar, I...<eos> - Don't say anything yet. Just...<eos> Just let me get this out.<eos> You're the best person I've ever known.<eos> That's why it hurt so much when we opened that envelope.<eos> It still hurts, but I can take it.<eos> What I can't take is losing you.<eos> Now I won't promise not to mess up.<eos> Because I will.
These days, you... You're the only real friend I have.<eos> Close the door.<eos> What can I do?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Huck's missing.<eos> How can I help?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> There's nothing for you to do.<eos> Go back to work. I'll keep you posted.<eos> Yeah, you will...
Unless he didn't.<eos> If they had anything, they would have charged him.<eos> And who knows what he would have said then?<eos> I do.<eos> He would have said "I want a lawyer."<eos> But they didn't charge him because he knew exactly what to say.<eos> Why'd they pick him up in the first place?<eos> Fishing expedition.<eos> They thought they had something. They didn't get what they needed.<eos> And they won't.
I like the sound of that.<eos> Well, as long as you don't drop the line, I'm squared away.<eos> I'm not gonna drop... square...<eos> Oh, that was... that was you trying to be funny, right?<eos> Like a joke? - Uh-huh.<eos> - Yeah. Feel that, though.<eos> - Ow. Man.<eos> - Ooh. My bad.<eos> Billy, don't leave me again.<eos> I won't.
But...<eos> I'm starting to think that maybe it's just not in the cards for me.<eos> No. Take it from a woman who has been married four times.<eos> Four?<eos> Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.<eos> And it will.
What was He like?<eos> What did God look like?<eos> What was He doing here?<eos> Let me ask you a question, Preacher.<eos> What do you want from Him?<eos> We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions?" The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> He might.<eos> No, He won't.
Never underestimate a crush.<eos> You don't have to tell me!<eos> What do we do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's not chasing you, she's inviting you.<eos> Release her.<eos> Release her from her promise.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> I will.
You don't have to tell me!<eos> What do we do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's not chasing you, she's inviting you.<eos> Release her.<eos> Release her from her promise.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
I haven't read through all of them.<eos> And I've never crossed through a mirror, but I know enough to know that anything is possible.<eos> - I need to talk to her.<eos> - I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> - Hank.<eos> - Nick, we got a body.<eos> Okay, I'll pick you up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Just make sure you talk to Eve.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Did a girl live here?<eos> Hank, she's here!<eos> It's okay, honey. We're police.<eos> Not for long.<eos> How long do we have to stay here?<eos> I'm not sure, honey.<eos> We have to keep you safe.<eos> So he won't find me here?<eos> Hey... he's never gonna find you, okay?<eos> No, he won't.
Zerstoerer hit the spice shop just after you left.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - He killed her.<eos> - This can't be happening.<eos> - He let you live again?<eos> It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> This will.
Do not jest about it.<eos> He is my husband till death do us part.<eos> Amen, sister.<eos> I think it was a mistake to refuse Sir Francis.<eos> I never knew you had ambitions to be a political wife.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> But you, your influence is great -- there's much good you could do.<eos> And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?<eos> Yes, but he too uses his power for his own ends and he would use me if I would let him.<eos> But I will not.
But I didn't do it.<eos> Shh, stop talking.<eos> All right, don't talk to anyone at all about this or about anything else, do you understand me?<eos> Keep your mouth and your sphincter shut.<eos> I'll be there first thing in the morning.<eos> I will get you out of there.<eos> Don't believe him.<eos> He's a fucking liar.<eos> Okay, okay, uh, listen, make sure you tell Tasha...<eos> I will.
A mother, a wife.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Let's give this man his dying wish.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I can do it for you.<eos> I can take him off the ventilator myself.<eos> No...<eos> He's my patient.<eos> I will.
I tried being a lawman.<eos> It didn't take.<eos> This is treason.<eos> And you're a dumpster fire.<eos> Don't sign anything.<eos> - They're liars.<eos> - What?<eos> Sign? Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you. - Oh?<eos> The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,<eos> - and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats!<eos> You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
She stays at the Chateau Guay Motel under a false name.<eos> You pay her, John, secret payments in cash.<eos> Money that you launder through Thunderbird Casino.<eos> You tipped off Corbett's people.<eos> As a result, an officer died.<eos> You pay Lidstrom to stay quiet about it.<eos> So why are you telling me?<eos> Why not just file your report?<eos> Because I want to understand.<eos> You won't.
- Well said, darling.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Fine, fine, but his treatise on God is hearsay.<eos> "Natura Naturans?" Please.<eos> And what does it even mean?<eos> It means God and Nature are one and the same.<eos> I am a certified teacher now, if you need a Latin tutor.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Albert may take you up on that.<eos> I will?
You fail to mention that the most wanted man. In france was present at a meeting I protected.<eos> We didn't owe you that information.<eos> You made a commitment not to compromise my credibility.<eos> You failed. I will not risk getting shot for treason.<eos> Because your word cannot be trusted.<eos> You called this meeting.<eos> You want something. My colleagues in berlin want to interrogate rigaud.<eos> Themselves. This is in neither of our interests.<eos> I will allow him to escape.<eos> Good. In exchange, I will no longer.
It goes with a festive line dance.<eos> Sort of like the Bielolitza.<eos> Disco is bullshit.<eos> -What do you mean, gone?<eos> -I've been looking all night.<eos> Her mother hasn't heard from her in three days.<eos> Dmitri says she'll be fired if she doesn't come to work tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> -What if she tells them about us?<eos> -She won't.
Men understand violence. They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Not women.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
Why not?<eos> He got lucky.<eos> You know what... what my son got?<eos> There's all kinds of luck.<eos> Jaquan's father died when he was 6.<eos> You want me to feel sorry for him?<eos> Gabe still has two loving parents.<eos> Well, my love doesn't help my son with this seizures and his pain.<eos> Taking Jaquan's life is not gonna help him, either.<eos> Well, the money will.
There is no Aaron.<eos> There's no Elena.<eos> There's just two strangers standing in a room,<eos> - getting ready to...<eos> - No.<eos> I know what you've gone through.<eos> Don't.<eos> I know how much they've hurt you.<eos> And you know what they'll do to me if I break my contract.<eos> They won't.
Those invisible blood-goblin things, they won't stop coming.<eos> I mean, not until your problem's dead, meaning you are.<eos> If you step out from under these wards...<eos> It'll find me and all of you.<eos> So I'm supposed to, what, just wait here, fingers crossed, while everyone who blames me for Alice's death risks their life?<eos> I mean, how does that even make sense?<eos> Just 'cause you can't come doesn't mean you can't be there.<eos> You can listen in and watch.<eos> All right, but if anything goes wrong...<eos> Nothing will. Okay?
- I know where I am!<eos> Next right. Then right turn.<eos> Oh, for God's sake!<eos> For living with on a day-to-day basis, German cars are far better.<eos> But as a driving machine, and you may find this conclusion surprising...<eos> I think the GS F has them licked.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Now...<eos> Now, I should point out, there is a new BMW M5 coming later this year, but it'll have to go some to be better than that GS F.<eos> - It really will.
What the hell's he doing here?<eos> It's okay.<eos> They helped me.<eos> You're leaving, aren't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.<eos> And in what reality would a corporation even bother<eos> - negotiating with a colony?<eos> - In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.<eos> Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
I'll have the Coast Guard come and pick you up.<eos> They're already coming for that guy.<eos> I didn't wanna strip my clothes off and try to drive the boat.<eos> It was that voodoo curse.<eos> Damn you, Tim!<eos> Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend. [grunts]<eos> I can tell that you're telling the truth.<eos> Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out.<eos> We'll do anything.<eos> Well, she will.
It matters if he doesn't stop.<eos> It matters if your people think they're on the wrong side.<eos> Hey, this is my business to manage.<eos> Don't mistake yourself or your place.<eos> Dad, she's trying to understand.<eos> Walker's a tribal lawyer.<eos> Sued us since forever.<eos> I handled it last couple years.<eos> And we beat him every time. And what if he comes back to the door now?<eos> He won't.
- And what of his current witch?<eos> - His wife, dear.<eos> The lady Gisela remains in Winchester.<eos> Well, he can't have gone far.<eos> Aethelwold is with Uhtred.<eos> They went in which direction?<eos> Mercia, Lord.<eos> I think it is something more than nothing, Odda, and I am wholly tired of never-ending disobedience.<eos> But it will not ruin your appetite, Lord.<eos> It will not.
Are you ok?<eos> So, I was thinking... what if we all went out for dinner tonight, all of us?<eos> All of us?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> When was the last time we went out?<eos> No. Well, I know it's not the same but<eos> And Christos won't even come.<eos> He doesn't like you.<eos> Oh, he will, eventually.
Oh, so you do live here. I know.<eos> I'm sorry that I came home so late last night.<eos> Did you and Courtney get your history presentation ready?<eos> Yeah. About half of it.<eos> But now I have to worry about this science project, too.<eos> I'm supposed to be growing crystals on this string.<eos> And I have to put sugar in there a couple of times a day.<eos> Hm, 'cause your life wasn't busy enough. Well, maybe they'll just appear, and I'll be done with it.<eos> So, have you given any more thought to what you want to do - for your birthday?<eos> - No. But I will.
That's the Merriwick Wish Book.<eos> - How did it get here?<eos> - Well, that's always a bit of a mystery, but this book has been passed down for hundreds of years to every Merriwick girl when she turns a certain age.<eos> You're supposed to write your deepest wish on one of the pages inside.<eos> So this is full of what people my age wrote?<eos> I can't wait to see what they wished for! Yeah.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - No, no, I want to read it.<eos> - And you will.
You might be ready, I'm not.<eos> The algorithm is adaptive.<eos> So it generates predictive flashpoints based on query input.<eos> Not unlike a crystal ball.<eos> Actually, that's what we're calling the app.<eos> And we've had lots of bites on the west coast, but no lead investor yet.<eos> Yeah, it's a risk-averse world out there, isn't it?<eos> But you know what?<eos> I can get you funded with just one phone call.<eos> But I won't.
Thank you for calling.<eos> He's alive.<eos> Bullet went straight through, no lasting damage.<eos> How the hell does this happen?<eos> Just relax, all right?<eos> We need to wash our hands of this right now, before it gets back to us.<eos> Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains, which is why we keep moving forward.<eos> It's just a setback.<eos> - And what if they catch Lozano?<eos> - They won't.
Because he's got nothing on us.<eos> Catalan is dead.<eos> The evidence connecting you and him doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Breathe, Peter. Everything is being handled accordingly.<eos> And what about Hookstraten?<eos> What about her?<eos> She's watching my every move.<eos> She questioned me when I forced the SEC to keep the markets open.<eos> - If she figures out why...<eos> - She won't.
Where did you get that?<eos> I took it.<eos> You gave me the lead, remember?<eos> The Weddle case.<eos> I knew they had Luke.<eos> I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me... If they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
So they'll steal it.<eos> A friend of mine at the D.O.D. owes me a favor.<eos> I'm gonna make a few calls.<eos> I'm sorry, are we actually considering helping a bloodthirsty biker gang steal lethal explosives in order to sell them to a terrorist group?<eos> We're not actually talking about giving them real explosives.<eos> The Kings will test it. They're gonna know if it's fake.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Nas, we can't use real explosives as bait.<eos> - Something could go wrong.<eos> - It won't.
When I was a kid, that was the place.<eos> They'd let you listen to any record, even if you wasn't gonna buy it.<eos> One of the owners... Mo Moretti was his name... He could look at you and tell what song you needed to hear.<eos> Every Saturday morning, we would wait for Mo to open up shop.<eos> He'd drive up in his all-black Cadillac Series '62, tunes flowing out the windows, cool shades, drinking a grape soda.<eos> I always wanted to be like Mo.<eos> Even if just for a minute.<eos> Driving around in a cool car, drinking my favorite drink, listening to my favorite record.<eos> Something I always wanted to do before I die.<eos> Then you will.
I'm trying to remember where I was when Martin Luther King got murdered.<eos> Oh, God, Dawn.<eos> I'm uncomfortable. What if people freak out?<eos> What if they put us on a watch list?<eos> What if Bill Cosby gets mad at us?<eos> Will you relax?<eos> They're not gonna know it's us.<eos> That's why they wore these things.<eos> What if they recognize our shoes?<eos> They won't.
You don't tell me a goddamn thing!<eos> I'm the King of England and you're all just people.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I did what I could.<eos> You simply think it's over for me.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> All of you, with your birthrights and your titles and your esteemed sense of privilege.<eos> You had a king who let you be corrupt and you destroyed that.<eos> You think Robert's gonna let you be that way?<eos> He won't.
Not so much.<eos> It's hard, reconciling both sides.<eos> That's why I'm a reverend.<eos> I suppose I'm trying to find meaning in this duality.<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Being a reverend led me here.<eos> This is my home, my purpose.<eos> And I don't want to lose it.<eos> You won't.
If she can't use her brain, why do they need her?<eos> Initiating ground launch sequencer now.<eos> Raven.<eos> Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?<eos> You know this is dumb, right?<eos> We'll all be dead before anything grows.<eos> The earth survived praimfaya once.<eos> It will again.
Every time we think that, something bad happens.<eos> So what then?<eos> Stay here and die?<eos> Spend your last days wasted?<eos> That seems to be a popular choice with the people I care about.<eos> - Monty, I...<eos> - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You know that, right?<eos> Oh, what, did you think our people are gonna waste a spot on Emori, on me?<eos> We were safe, and you screwed us.<eos> You want to know what we're up to?<eos> It's called surviving.<eos> There's a bunker on that island.<eos> You're our ride. That's it.<eos> That bunker's not stocked, Murphy.<eos> You won't last 5 months, let alone 5 years.<eos> No. We probably won't.
You need to think about where your allegiance lies.<eos> - No, I don't. - Fine.<eos> You're clear about that.<eos> Let me be clear about this--<eos> You can't lie to me.<eos> You can't operate without my authority, ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest, and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
- What?<eos> - She was right.<eos> Wouldn't war make anyone grumpy?<eos> Not her.<eos> Nope. She was...<eos> She was happy.<eos> She was always smiling and joking and laughing.<eos> I don't know what to say. I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what... I don't know what to say<eos> You will.
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's so much suffering.<eos> So many injured.<eos> Miss, please, help me.<eos> Just try to stay still.<eos> Let me see what we're dealing with.<eos> I don't want to die alone.<eos> You won't.
Making a complaint to Head Office.<eos> No idea.<eos> Never had a head office.<eos> But as far as I remember, there's a successful rebellion six months later.<eos> Corporate dominance in space is history, - and that about wraps it for capitalism.<eos> - Yay!<eos> Then the human race finds a whole new mistake...<eos> But that's another story.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> But you will.
Are you all right?<eos> Yes, fine.<eos> How go the wedding preparations?<eos> Oh... they're fine.<eos> Is there anything I can help with?<eos> Is that something that you'd actually want to help with?<eos> You're acting like you think I'd disapprove of it.<eos> Your husband is about to welcome another husband into his bed.<eos> You're a king.<eos> Of course you will.
That's clear.<eos> Just like these people.<eos> These frightened, confused people, they don't really see you right now.<eos> They see a woman with a gun.<eos> But I see you.<eos> I do.<eos> And I know you're a good person.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> You will help me.<eos> Not under duress I won't.
'.. arriving into Sheffield.<eos> Sheffield's your next station stop.<eos> If you're leaving us here in Sheffield...<eos> - So, we do it, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We draw up a roster.<eos> Beth will still do her two nights, I'll do my one.<eos> That leaves four nights between the seven of you.<eos> - Phil won't do one.<eos> - He will.
I need to make music that feeds my soul.<eos> And my music don't.<eos> - You want what?<eos> - Simone's address.<eos> You're no better than anybody else in this house.<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You're not getting any information on a child in the system, even if she was your sister.<eos> You killed him!<eos> - What if they come looking for us?<eos> - They won't.
- We did so dope, though.<eos> See, I put my balls on the line for you.<eos> I took a big chance.<eos> So now you all better start listening to me, 'cause I'm gonna manage you.<eos> You booked us at a house party, Jahil.<eos> It's not you got us meetings with record execs.<eos> Damn, Alexandra.<eos> - Cold-blooded.<eos> - Please let the man talk.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Take some money.<eos> I met a man, children.<eos> I still have a penis.<eos> I hope I don't let you down.<eos> I am a man.<eos> Say it!<eos> - Just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
I got to talk some sense into this girl.<eos> Why don't you come in the house, sweetie?<eos> You must be freezing cold.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Cut the crap, Arlene.<eos> You don't like me, and the only reason you haven't called the cops yet is because you know exactly what I'll them that your son did to me.<eos> Perfect, let's just act like we normally do.<eos> Whatever issue that you have with my son can be handled, I'm sure, very quietly.<eos> We're not gonna have any problems as long as your son learns to keep his hands off of me.<eos> And he will.
- Because of me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, because... they have something we need.<eos> That woman, Noa, she's gonna take our family someplace safe.<eos> But we have to do this first.<eos> And what if you don't come back?<eos> Then you need to take care of your sister and brother.<eos> Go to Aunt Maddie, ask for her help.<eos> She won't listen to me.<eos> She will.
- That makes no sense.<eos> - He went rogue.<eos> He did what he thought was right.<eos> Because he didn't like how a case turned out.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I forced the team to review Landon's conviction.<eos> Sam's a liability to the CIU.<eos> This is not up for debate.<eos> Once Gerald's case is over, fire him.<eos> Or I will.
No, I don't want the cash.<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> Deran, listen.<eos> Deran, listen, to me.<eos> We need to move the money now. No!<eos> No!<eos> We're not going through my bar.<eos> Okay?<eos> don't get hot and do anything stupid with that thing.<eos> I won't if they won't.
Hey, Garcia, would you mind backing up and freezing on the unsub?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> We're saying "he," but it's hard to tell if the unsub is male or female.<eos> That could be a woman or a man with a slight build.<eos> So are these coordinated blitz attacks by multiple unsubs or the act of a lone wolf?<eos> Either way, we could be looking at a spree in the making.<eos> Wheels up in 20.<eos> Guys, hold on.<eos> I know it's gonna be hard not to think about Reid in prison, but we'll get through this.<eos> And more importantly, Reid will, too.
You are my bodyguard and my most trusted protector.<eos> But you can't be anything more.<eos> I understand.<eos> What do you mean you can't give Luc and me the annulment?<eos> You promised!<eos> I promised to try.<eos> A king is not a pope, Claude.<eos> We can't go on like this, Charles.<eos> You said weeks ago that this annulment would happen.<eos> And it will.
Because my relationship gives me strength, Harry.<eos> It doesn't hold me back.<eos> It allows me to accomplish whatever I need, including this.<eos> We're done.<eos> I'm cutting you loose.<eos> You're a free agent now.<eos> Oh, and, um... I have all the help that I need.<eos> It's not you.<eos> What happens when he changes his mind?<eos> He won't!
Jones is dead, Freddy's gone. I can flush the coke.<eos> - I appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> I really do, you know that.<eos> This was a wake-up call.<eos> - I'll be okay. - Talk to Weller.<eos> Take some time off.<eos> Get some help.<eos> I don't need help, Tasha.<eos> I mean this in the most loving way possible, either you tell Weller you need some time off, or I will do it for you.<eos> No, you won't.
- He is still alive.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I've asked the young man I believe to be your grandson,<eos> - to come here today.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> Grandmother, let's go.<eos> Adam is dead.<eos> Shut up, Jonah, just shut up!<eos> Mr. Foster, it may be best if you leave.<eos> I will not.
Everything's gonna be ok.<eos> And that is you, and that is him.<eos> It's from that day we went to the park.<eos> What's up, my man?<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Don't play that. Hey, where you goin'?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down!<eos> No, they won't.
An infection like that could leach into your bloodstream and kill you.<eos> Definitely leave it in, then.<eos> You can die from a tooth?<eos> Don't listen to this tongue toucher.<eos> Back in the old days, dentists weren't even a thing.<eos> Barbers took care of everything above the shoulders.<eos> You didn't know that, Doctor?<eos> I don't know where all this animosity's coming from, but it doesn't change the fact that tooth needs to come out.<eos> Do it yourself for all I care.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I will.
If she isn't at any of the hospitals, is there a chance that...<eos> she didn't make it?<eos> Last our guy saw, she was alive.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When I was dancing with that girl... with Kathy...<eos> I was thinking,<eos> "I'm gonna remember this night."<eos> Now everyone will.
The room you are looking at is airtight.<eos> Release Tahir Khaled, or watch your wife suffocate to death, Sam Hanna.<eos> Can you trace the signal?<eos> Eric? Uh, he's routing the signal through different IPs.<eos> Every few seconds, it changes to a new signal path.<eos> Talk to Zhrov.<eos> See who paid him.<eos> We tried. He won't talk.<eos> Work him. Try again.<eos> Okay, I will.
I'm at the motel, but my mom's not here.<eos> You're in Dallas?<eos> My uncle brought me.<eos> We came in the bus.<eos> Tony, listen to me.<eos> You wait there, okay?<eos> I'll come by as soon as I can.<eos> Just hurry.<eos> And tell my mom I love her.<eos> I will.
It never leaves my side.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> It may be the realm's only hope of defeating the darkness.<eos> I will guard it with my life.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> You need to get to safety.<eos> You need to share these stories.<eos> But who will believe them?<eos> Someday... someone will.
So, you know I'm awake.<eos> I know everything.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Put me in the crazy house, too?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're much more useful to me out here.<eos> What's that mean... "useful"?<eos> Turns out, getting a Savior to give up her belief is much harder than I thought.<eos> Even if you take everything away from her, which I have, there's still that one last pesky speck of belief that just refuses to die out.<eos> And it never will.
- I'm gonna take the next one.<eos> - No, Dad, no, come.<eos> - We have rats.<eos> - Or we don't.<eos> We've had two exterminators go through everything.<eos> - "We"?<eos> - Yes, we, Dad.<eos> We are cohabitating, and we do have rats.<eos> - We'll talk about this later.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Hey, Dad, listen. The four of us got together last night, and we came up with a list of 11 students and two teachers that you need to do something about.<eos> Maybe you should start with Mark Rutledge.<eos> Why? What'd he do?<eos> He wouldn't kiss Ruth at the Sadie Hawkins dance, even though she bought him dinner before at Walt's Roast Beef.<eos> Well, I don't see how that's got anything to do...<eos> And he called you fat.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna squish him!<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't take any crap from anyone.<eos> Oh, I won't.
- Get in.<eos> Mr. Lee!<eos> Get in, I'll drive.<eos> It'll be a while before the tow truck arrives.<eos> Jesus H. Christ!<eos> Why don't we listen to her story?<eos> Didn't you see?<eos> He's a major asshole.<eos> Fine, don't do it then.<eos> Of course I won't.
Oh, actually, Fisher's an outer space buff.<eos> - Aren't you, Fish?<eos> - I don't even like Mars bars.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'll go get changed.<eos> Okay, I guess I'll go get the car.<eos> - You don't like Mars bars? - Nah.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Look, I know you said this will all blow over, but I'm telling you, I know Kirsten.<eos> It won't.
Yeah, great. The conveyor belt in the laundry.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Well, it's gotta lead to a...<eos> I dunno, a loading dock or something, right?<eos> Yeah, which'll be guarded and need a swipe card.<eos> - Well, have you ever been out there?<eos> - No, so? Worth checkin' out, right?<eos> Yeah, all right, I'll get Smiles to let us in.<eos> Okay, cool. What if she asks questions?<eos> She won't.
Murdered, to be precise.<eos> I'm exploring the possibility that his killer was someone that he cheated at cards.<eos> Cheated?<eos> No, no way.<eos> No.<eos> I run a clean game here.<eos> Well, I know from personal experience that people like you vet your customers thoroughly, so I refuse to believe that you were unaware that your game was being frequented by a magician whose specialty was card manipulation.<eos> Claude paid me to look the other way when he played.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of the names of all of your regular players.<eos> No, you won't.
The lab's just emailed the results.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - It was water.<eos> - What?<eos> Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.<eos> But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?<eos> Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?<eos> What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?<eos> - He won't.
Childcare crisis.<eos> Just came in to pick up some work. For here, not just for the exams.<eos> I'll get something sorted and be back in tomorrow, I promise.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Were we too hard on Richard?<eos> - Coercion wasn't the major factor.<eos> - Really?<eos> No, it's more like he wants to prove something.<eos> Yes, well, as long as he doesn't say 'yes' as an intellectual exercise and then back off when things start to get dicey.<eos> He won't.
Tell them to get to the OR<eos> - before we lose an FBI agent.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> It's called Retinitis Pigmentosa.<eos> It's an inherited, degenerative eye disease.<eos> Yeah, well, that explains the night blindness and the tunnel vision. Follow my finger.<eos> Vitamin supplements and acetazolamide might help.<eos> But they won't stop it, and I can't afford them, anyway.<eos> - V.A. will pay for it.<eos> - No, they won't.
Abby, wait!<eos> Hey! Taxi!<eos> Abby, come on.<eos> Please, Abby, just take the book down.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, all right, but you have to introduce us to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.<eos> Yes, he would love to meet you.<eos> Then I will consider, maybe, taking the book down until you get your stupid tenure at your stupider college.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yes, I will. Yes, of course!
- Yes. - I almost got killed.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It was so awesome.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Everyone thinks this video is fake.<eos> Look at these comments.<eos> We have to bring a ghost back to this lab and document it, you guys.<eos> I mean, this stuff is real.<eos> We have to be able to prove it.<eos> We will.
Well, maybe it is.<eos> It's just I have these feelings about Daniel.<eos> Like I know him. Like I've known him for a really long time.<eos> Yeah, maybe you guys went to preschool together or something.<eos> Well, I asked him if we'd met before and he said no and he basically ran away.<eos> It was strange. Yeah.<eos> Something definitely not quite... hmm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can get in a lot of trouble if you tell anybody what I'm about to say to you, okay?<eos> I won't.
This is our base. He knows we don't speak Chinese, right?<eos> You almost destroyed us.<eos> - That was a close call, sir.<eos> - You almost got us all killed.<eos> Ah, yeah. But then I saved everyone.<eos> You don't get credit for cleaning up you own mess.<eos> And you destroyed one of our Tugs.<eos> Uh, actually, sir. If anybody's to blame I...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus. It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
- I'll think about it. - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna think about it.<eos> You were the best fighter in the world.<eos> And I want to see that back in the ring.<eos> You're just happy it will be another black guy getting punched tonight.<eos> No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
Someone that will accomplish the tasks they are given.<eos> - I can be that person for you, sir,<eos> I just need another chance.<eos> - I don't think you understand.<eos> Finding true loyalty, a person that will act without hesitation. That will not question my guidance, that is of value to me.<eos> - I can be that for you, I know I can.<eos> - 170 cherry Lane.<eos> The gate will be open.<eos> Make sure they never do it again.<eos> - I will.
You are an incredible dancer.<eos> I thought that's all I'd be doing... dancing.<eos> But then clients kept asking for more and Dorian just doesn't take no for an answer.<eos> But then an older girl took pity on me and showed me a trick... it's called Rohypnol.<eos> It's a pill that puts clients to sleep.<eos> You roofied me.<eos> Wait, but why? I never would have tried anything.<eos> I know that... now.<eos> - You have to quit.<eos> - I will.
(UPLIFTING MUSIC)<eos> BOY: (SHOUTS) Read all about it!<eos> Read all about Christ's return!<eos> Read all about it!<eos> I'd like to see the view from up in those clouds.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> You will soon enough.<eos> We all will.
Because God is tribal.<eos> God takes sides.<eos> No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations. Mm mm.<eos> I've figured it out way back, if God is all powerful, he cannot be all good.<eos> And if he's all good then he cannot be all powerful.<eos> And neither can you be.<eos> They need to see the fraud you are, with their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> And tonight they will.
Oh, I just...<eos> And a dead woman who was very much alive a moment ago.<eos> You're not getting out of this one.<eos> You can't do this. No, you can't.<eos> Oh, yes, he can, but he won't. Because he's a police counsellor and not a monster.<eos> I'm sure this gentleman didn't take anything that doesn't belong to him because he knows exactly what that would mean.<eos> And so he will do what he does best when he leaves this place.<eos> He will return to his comfortable little apartment. And he will observe what is going on here.<eos> Yes, of course, Inspector.<eos> I will.
Almost done.<eos> Almost done. - _<eos> - You sure? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> _<eos> That's fine.<eos> Stoudemire has got to stay on the bench.<eos> He can't sit on the bench, man.<eos> You can't build a team around both of them. You gotta just build a team around Melo.<eos> - He's not the same... - No one else is gonna put up those points.<eos> Yeah, but Melo will.
- It's his birthday!<eos> - Come on!<eos> No, Mom!<eos> Just a little something.<eos> The suitcase is already overstuffed with gifts for Will.<eos> It's always fun to get something from the airport.<eos> Feels like you've traveled, too.<eos> Ma, he's turning one.<eos> Don't think he'll be discerning what gift came from where.<eos> But I will.
'You and the tribe won't like it.<eos> 'I have asked an Englishwoman to marry me.<eos> 'A white woman.'<eos> It will not happen.<eos> It will.<eos> What in God's name is wrong with you?<eos> At least Muriel only wants to convert them!<eos> I've said yes.<eos> - She might change her mind, George.<eos> - She won't!
Make the wrong choice.<eos> And we're beat.<eos> It's all over.<eos> Open your eyes, little bug.<eos> Mexico.<eos> You and me.<eos> - C'mon, love birds!<eos> Let's get a wiggle on! We cross, then we rest easy!<eos> I'll never be able to show you how grateful I am.<eos> You will.
Who kidnaps a Scottish freelance photographer?<eos> The whole point of kidnapping is to get money, right?<eos> As far as I understand, lain was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Can this half-assed country not even do kidnapping right?<eos> ISAF does not think this was an upper-tier organization.<eos> So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
Hello?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> How many times has she texted you today?<eos> I don't know.<eos> -She called the landline three times.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's getting crazy.<eos> - I will.
They keep saying that Merry did this.<eos> Make them stop saying it.<eos> - Not Merry. Nobody knows if she did it.<eos> - That's right. Nobody knows.<eos> Let them talk.<eos> You're the mother.<eos> She's just a little girl.<eos> Maybe not so little anymore.<eos> - Tell them, Lou.<eos> - I will. I will.
I don't watch you 24 hours a day.<eos> So then, go sleep in the car, please.<eos> Do us all a favor.<eos> The car is a fucking petri dish.<eos> I'm not gonna ride in it.<eos> My mom will just give me a new one.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - I cleaned it, it's fine.<eos> - Why don't you sleep in it?<eos> - Maybe I will.
We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
We were together five years, and he can come to dinner now?<eos> David, I just want...<eos> What is this?<eos> You and I bought fucking diapers together for her today.<eos> We sat with the hospice and picked up medicine together.<eos> I've been fucking living with you in your house... For 10 months... And it's been good...<eos> Or "maybe he's getting more accepting"...<eos> But then it's like, you won't even come up to my apartment... Whenever we're in New York?<eos> It's like this one little thing and you won't do it!<eos> You won't!
Exchange me.<eos> Use me to bargain with them.<eos> It worked the last time.<eos> With a lad.<eos> These are soldiers.<eos> No.<eos> Never. You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!<eos> Give up our hostage?<eos> Not likely.<eos> We'll rather...
No.<eos> Never. You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!<eos> Give up our hostage?<eos> Not likely.<eos> We'll rather...<eos> Claire's right.<eos> The soldiers will not hurt her. They'll escort her to a place of safety, then let her go.<eos> I will not give you up!<eos> Bring out the woman, or we shall set fire to the thatch and burn you out!<eos> Yes, you will, you stubborn Scot.

But Dougal speaks true.<eos> I will use every option in my power to defeat the British, and that includes raising the MacKenzie banner.<eos> I do not doubt yer fighting spirit, but I know that you will not sacrifice your men needlessly.<eos> If the cause is lost, then you will put the lives of yer men above all else.<eos> You tell me that you would do the same.<eos> Say the words... meaning them, in yer head and in yer heart, and the guardianship is yers.<eos> My poor brother.<eos> I have lived my life crippled in body, and he has lived his crippled in mind.<eos> In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto her as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.

This must be it.<eos> It's called Sunstone Manor.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> You have to send me there, so I can play my part.<eos> How am I going to convince Erica that I got rid of you?<eos> - _<eos> - Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> If you see Ren, tell him that I loved him too.<eos> I will.
I owe him an apology. Animals should be transported in and remain housed in..<eos> Veterinary care needed by individual animals will have to be provided by the pet's owner.<eos> All right, Malina, take off your hood.<eos> - Someone might recognize me.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You're gonna get her killed.<eos> Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday.<eos> Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there.<eos> What if Erica Kravid sees it too?<eos> She probably will.
You better get to your celebration, Dad.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's the guest of honour?<eos> I'm sure he's on his way.<eos> I've nailed him.<eos> He's running drugs.<eos> Now, the Assistant Commissioner's gonna be there tonight.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him privately, after the event.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I do.<eos> Do you, Grace Helen Burgess, solemnly swear to love, honour and obey till death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Get out of it!<eos> - All right, Arthur, come on.<eos> - Wait for me! Wait for me good self!<eos> Go on, take the photograph!<eos> - Get the bastards in the house. - I will.<eos> I will. John!
They're trying to forge a lasting peace, and so am I.<eos> They're using you.<eos> "Look at that nice grounder in his uniform."<eos> They think it proves we can live together.<eos> It does.<eos> What if I don't want to live together?<eos> And don't tell me about the kill order.<eos> We can go far away.<eos> Luna's clan will take us in.<eos> No. They won't.
If you hurry, you can make it out before he gets back.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> This must be very stressful for you and your baby.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Could I have some water?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
Mr. Fox is pulling up out front.<eos> I told Gordon if I don't hear from you within an hour, I'm going to go straight to Bullock.<eos> I have to do this, Alfred.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Of course you got a choice.<eos> In the same way I can choose to let you go with my blessing and tell you to bring that little girl home safe, or I can tell you right now,<eos> I can stick you on an airplane and fly you somewhere very far away.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Don't be such a donker.<eos> But I won't.
You okay?<eos> You look kind of hinky.<eos> Never better.<eos> Strange! Strange, you son of a bitch!<eos> Come back here!<eos> So... you're really doing this?<eos> Not my call.<eos> Prepare the patients for transport to the upstate facility.<eos> If even one of your patients were to escape...<eos> They won't.
Chaperones.<eos> Oh, it's just like Matthew McConaughey! McConaughey, yeah.<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - Thanks, thanks.<eos> Um, shall we hit the road, guys? Yes.<eos> Sweet.<eos> - Hilarious. - Neal, after you.<eos> Got some loose lips on you, huh?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - No. I will not.
Please forgive her.<eos> Brother...<eos> Relax, let me handle it.<eos> What is left of her anyway?<eos> She's a chewed out bone.<eos> Let's chop and throw her.<eos> No.<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> Assure them you won't do it again.<eos> She won't.
- He's right. His place is no' here without us... nor in France on his own.<eos> Bring him with ye, Murtagh, when ye come with the men.<eos> Aye. If I havena killed him first.<eos> Dinna fash, Claire.<eos> We'll keep him well away from the battle.<eos> The outcome is in yer hands, laddie.<eos> A good soldier must learn to obey his commanding officer...<eos> As well as his general.<eos> Take care of each other... and watch out for my grandsire.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna cut to the chase.<eos> I am the first woman in the world to have prostate cancer.<eos> Uh, the doctor told me it's spread to the spine and there's nothing to do.<eos> We'll spend whatever we have to.<eos> One call and I can get you to the best doctor in the world.<eos> Oh, it's too late.<eos> And I don't want to spend my last days wasting away in a hospital with a catheter up my dick and poison in my body, so...<eos> But who will take care of us?<eos> You can't leave us alone.<eos> I won't.
I'll take that phone, too.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> How soon?<eos> The judge is reviewing the Rule 35 order now.<eos> I mean, once he signs it, if they make an arrest, it won't take these guys long to figure out it was me that talked to the Feds.<eos> Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.<eos> The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.<eos> - You know where they're sending me?<eos> - Nope. And I never will.<eos> Nobody will.
What are you talking about?<eos> It was an accident. I told you we should have kept the shotgun in the trunk.<eos> You tell her, Moonroof.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, Biggs, out there I need a partner who's gonna watch my back, not accidentally shoot me in it.<eos> Fine. Don't be my partner.<eos> I'm sure I can find someone who'll ride with me.<eos> Really?<eos> Show of hands... who wants to ride shotgun with Biggs?<eos> I will.
You changed the locks on the door again.<eos> Sorry, I should have told you.<eos> - Does Grandma know you're here?<eos> - I left her a note.<eos> I really don't think they'll miss me.<eos> - Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
- More than anything.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> And I can also see that Alex is more than just one of your agents.<eos> She's family.<eos> And you want to protect her at all costs.<eos> I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
- But... - Okay. - You need to talk to Eleanor.<eos> Get her to file on these thugs.<eos> Letting them walk is a mistake, and I am compromised because you told me about it.<eos> She isn't gonna change her mind.<eos> They belong in prison.<eos> Look, no way Joey Marks is gonna let those guys skate after screwing this up.<eos> They will get what is coming to them.<eos> Do you really want the full report? No, I do not.<eos> I just hope this doesn't come back to bite us all in the ass.<eos> It won't.
I call lawyer.<eos> He gets here, you can ask questions.<eos> You're familiar with our legal system.<eos> American cops can't do shit.<eos> Your criminals don't know how easy they got it.<eos> _<eos> You wait outside 'til lawyer gets here.<eos> Hey, you know our system, you know it can take forever to resolve legal problems.<eos> Oh, I have no legal problems.<eos> - You will.
No.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> You.<eos> You.<eos> Dad?<eos> Carl. No.<eos> Sooner or later, we're fighting our way out.<eos> I know that you're fully aware that we will.<eos> Yeah... we will.
So do you think Jeff and Benz are working on this together?<eos> Probably. I don't know.<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you eaten yet?<eos> It's been 2 days.<eos> I can't.<eos> We need our strength to get out of here.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why is he feeding us, if he's just gonna kill us?<eos> Maybe he won't.
Up or down? Up or down?<eos> Down!<eos> - Up!<eos> - Right.<eos> We... or...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. We don't need to do this.<eos> - No?<eos> If they come through that door...<eos> - They won't.
I gotta change.<eos> I'm going to see Champagne Enema tonight.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's the new band name.<eos> But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after.<eos> But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and, uh... [inhales deeply] everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
Yeah. I thought it was cats.<eos> So, how much longer we gotta wait before you knock that Misty Holloway to the number two spot?<eos> The new song?<eos> It's fly, tío.<eos> Good. Well maybe you can debut it at my fundraiser tonight.<eos> I'd love to, but it's not quite ready yet.<eos> Well, you tell Jackie to come and see me tonight.<eos> He's just trying to impress you with a great song.<eos> Tell him to bring whatever he's got.<eos> I will.
They're here!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> I can't believe it! They're here!<eos> They're here!<eos> Sign here.<eos> And sign here.<eos> Initial here.<eos> Initial here, here, and...<eos> I love you, my little lady.<eos> And we always will.
- You never told me that.<eos> - Well, I'm telling you now.<eos> Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida into many bloody pieces... starting by taking off her head.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Never happened.<eos> Instead, he woke up in a hospital with two broken arms and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.<eos> Jesus, Matt.<eos> If I take a night off, people get hurt.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> - You won't.
Dr. summers would see you now.<eos> "Flouted procedure, et cetera.<eos> Engaged in unauthorized and inappropriate procedure.<eos> Refused to perform others in keeping with regulation."<eos> Naughty, naughty surgeon. You have not been playing well with some of your commissioned colleagues.<eos> Dr. hale has a way of bringing out the best in me.<eos> He's prepared to submit this to the surgeon general.<eos> My contract's finished next week, sir.<eos> If you'll allow me to complete my term...<eos> I will not.
I like the way you say "hello."<eos> Thank you so much for the beautiful roses.<eos> These beautiful roses?<eos> Oh, the note got lost, but I know they're from you. You big hunk of romance.<eos> - You sure there's no note?<eos> - Mm-mm. In that case, you're very welcome.<eos> Did you see us kissing again?<eos> I sure did.<eos> You're not gonna tell Ramona, right?<eos> I sure won't.
I need your help.<eos> I need your help to get him out of the truck.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Apaches, comanches, they fought over this land, too.<eos> The same land.<eos> But we put these borders here.<eos> Flores, tell them... Tell my kids to...<eos> Just make sure they don't forget to listen.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir, I will.
I told her if she wasn't careful, some day they were gonna kill her.<eos> Or kick her to the side, or worse, break her heart.<eos> But she wouldn't listen.<eos> She would say people felt safer when they knew that she was around.<eos> She'd say that.<eos> Those goddamn fucking apes.<eos> Those fucking piles of mud.<eos> I'd like to send those sons of bitches back to that primordial ooze that they came from.<eos> And I would if I thought it would bring her back.<eos> But it won't, so...
Those fucking piles of mud.<eos> I'd like to send those sons of bitches back to that primordial ooze that they came from.<eos> And I would if I thought it would bring her back.<eos> But it won't, so...<eos> - Yeah, no, it...<eos> - Listen. You find that son of a bitch who did that.<eos> And I don't care what Power it came from.<eos> You let me know who it was, and I'll find 'em.<eos> I'll crush their skull like a grape.<eos> I will. I will, Patrick.
I can do it, but it's complicated.<eos> I don't know how long it'll take.<eos> We need it done as quickly as possible.<eos> Then I should start now.<eos> Handoff is happening in less than an hour.<eos> It appears you need a new driver.<eos> Look at the three of you.<eos> Larry, Curly, could you give me a moment? I need to have a word with Moe.<eos> Jack, I have neither the time nor the patience right now.<eos> You will.
Yeah, well, I'm still breathing through it, ain't it?<eos> But that's not the point, man!<eos> The names he called you...<eos> Queen.<eos> Queer.<eos> I...<eos> I heard every word he said, Gunnar, and it's not the last time I'm gonna hear them, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend every night post-show filing hate-crime reports when it's not gonna make a difference!<eos> You were attacked, and you cannot let him get away with that!<eos> Trust me.<eos> I won't.
What are you talking about?<eos> If I didn't say anything, you wouldn't have known about the show,<eos> - sh... she wouldn't have run away.<eos> - No. No.<eos> Listen to m...<eos> Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
I guess 'cause you feel vulnerable and... ashamed.<eos> Well, you're saying something now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Huffington Post said they'd run it if I'm willing to send it.<eos> So...<eos> There it goes.<eos> This is my favorite place to work.<eos> I should text Cash.<eos> She would love to see it here, too.<eos> She will, all right?
And whose fault is that?<eos> So, are you happy here?<eos> Are they taking good care of you?<eos> People come here to die.<eos> Why would I be happy?<eos> I'm getting a promotion.<eos> So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.<eos> Somewhere near the beach or something.<eos> You won't come back.<eos> Of course I will.
Go back to the sanitarium, cripple.<eos> No!<eos> No! Please, stop!<eos> I am not a patient.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
Hey, hold on.<eos> Pupils aren't dilated.<eos> Jaha gave me the key to the City of Light,Abby... not drugs.<eos> Yeah. Let's see what the blood tests say. Thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> I am.<eos> It's just unusual for pain to subside this quickly.<eos> Uh, so am I all clear?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Let Sinclair know that I said it was ok for you to go back to work, But you're benched again if I find anything abnormal in those tests.<eos> You won't.
Morgan... they always come back.<eos> Come back when they're dead, too.<eos> Yeah, we'll stop them. We have before.<eos> I'm not talking about the walkers.<eos> Morgan wants to talk to them first.<eos> I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
That's how this is gonna play out.<eos> Axelrod is gonna be with your guy in a room, just the two of them, sitting there, and he's gonna be staring right the fuck through him.<eos> Maybe by the end of today.<eos> But you know what? Maybe it's not my game anymore.<eos> But you know what? Maybe it's not my game anymore.<eos> Yeah, maybe it's you young guys, eating your salads<eos> - and remaking the world.<eos> No, I know how to win.<eos> But, uh... if that's not what it is anymore, then, uh... you do it your way, Bryan.<eos> Okay, I will.
And let this wretched world end and let another begin.<eos> The world of the night.<eos> The world of the bat and the owl and the spider.<eos> The blessed dark.<eos> He's a handsome man, your master.<eos> Ah. Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.
I'm moving between the air.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm the bringer of the Ginga!<eos> And that's capoeira.<eos> Jas.<eos> The mayor was her uncle.<eos> Seems I was right about the limited gene pool.<eos> I am sorry that I rode you so hard back then.<eos> I hope we can put our differences behind us.<eos> I will if you will.
They all fell in line with it though, didn't they?<eos> We just wanted to put it all behind us.<eos> Can anybody vouch for you at the benefit on Saturday night?<eos> Every trawlerman that wasn't out at sea.<eos> We had a lock-in till two.<eos> She was there an' all.<eos> I left around eleven.<eos> Went home. Early start.<eos> OK. Now, if Lee Stonnall shows his face again...<eos> He won't.
You know, why don't you just get back out there, okay?<eos> Because my diamond guy's setting up.<eos> Just make sure that Tiffany picks the emerald cut, 'cause like it or not, that's what she's getting.<eos> And you, why don't you go do something?<eos> How about you, Wags?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're just going to sit there? Oh, no.<eos> Uh, no, you know I never listen.<eos> Yeah. Why don't you just make yourself busy?<eos> I will.
- How will this reassembling take place?<eos> - Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
You've apparently gone into something called a fugue state.<eos> Look at me, Vanessa.<eos> I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> There's a lot we don't understand.<eos> It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.
No, I definitely want you.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I just have this feeling that, uh... sex is... It's a very complicated thing for you.<eos> My dad started selling me to his friends when I was 11.<eos> All my life I had this fantasy.<eos> One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
He said you'd do anything to fool me.<eos> Jemma, please.<eos> I wouldn't trick you.<eos> I don't want you to end up dead like me.<eos> We... don't want that to happen to you.<eos> - It's in your best interest...<eos> - ...to stay away.<eos> We don't want to hurt you ...<eos> any of you.<eos> But we will.
But the real conflict you're having now is between your head and your heart.<eos> Your head. Your head knows that the only crime you committed was surviving.<eos> But your heart?<eos> Your heart still thinks it was murder.<eos> So I guess you, uh...<eos> You gotta get your heart to catch up to your head.<eos> I feel like it's more than guilt though, you know, I feel like...<eos> I feel like I lost something.<eos> You know, I feel like I can't get it back.<eos> You won't.
I said I'd help you find the Desert Wolf.<eos> I didn't say it was gonna be easy.<eos> The restraints are to keep you from hurting yourself.<eos> Or me.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> This is what the Dread Doctors used to keep track of the Chimeras.<eos> It seeks out and hones in on a certain frequency.<eos> They gave the Chimeras their own unique vibration.<eos> So how is that going to help me find Deaton?<eos> It won't.
What?<eos> Never wanted to watch Charlotte walk the streets again?<eos> I mean, that pretty much covers everyone who loves us.<eos> Should we add your mom to that suspect list too?<eos> I don't know how to handle this.<eos> - You have to tell him.<eos> - How?<eos> Liam, he spent the last week pounding out chapters.<eos> But if he ships them to Boston before you speak to him......<eos> He won't.
That's why tonight went south! Shh.<eos> Lyla, listen.<eos> I know I-- I know I messed up.<eos> I--I know my head isn't on right, but--but he's my brother, and Laurel, she-- she was like a sister.<eos> I know, and it's horrible, but right now, Johnny, you are not acting like the man I married.<eos> You're the man I divorced.<eos> Lyla, look.<eos> I just wanted to help him, to bring my brother back.<eos> Then bring him to justice, but do it the right way.<eos> I will.
Lyla, listen.<eos> I know I-- I know I messed up.<eos> I--I know my head isn't on right, but--but he's my brother, and Laurel, she-- she was like a sister.<eos> I know, and it's horrible, but right now, Johnny, you are not acting like the man I married.<eos> You're the man I divorced.<eos> Lyla, look.<eos> I just wanted to help him, to bring my brother back.<eos> Then bring him to justice, but do it the right way.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Get out.<eos> For real? - Get out of here. - Get out!<eos> Get out of our town!<eos> We don't want you here!<eos> Get out of this town!<eos> "Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!<eos> No, you won't.
Beowulf knows the truth.<eos> What truth?<eos> He knows what I am.<eos> You told him?<eos> He saw.<eos> I had no choice, it was that or let him die.<eos> A skinshifter saved his life.<eos> He must have choked on that.<eos> I won't let him harm you.<eos> I won't.
You have no birthright.<eos> You gave it up when you joined your uncle in treason.<eos> Oh, for once in your life, can you please just be honest with yourself?<eos> You never had any intention of stepping aside for me, did you?<eos> I did.<eos> At first.<eos> Well, good luck to you.<eos> Slean.<eos> Slean, I swore to you I would do whatever I had to to see you were Thane.<eos> And I will.
Listen, you guys, I know what this looks like, but Ben is not playing us.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> He never wanted us anywhere near that wedding.<eos> That's right, because he's trying to protect us.<eos> He's trying to protect himself, okay?<eos> He doesn't want us near his big score.<eos> This isn't his score, it's Sybil's.<eos> And the minute that it's done, she's going to kill him.<eos> - You believe him?<eos> - No, she won't.
We made a great record, but it's not enough anymore, Kels.<eos> You need some kind of a story, and the minute that TMZ shows clips from that tape, I promise you, you will be the biggest artist in the world.<eos> - For about 10 seconds.<eos> - It only takes one, pal.<eos> They're gonna click on that link, watch the footage, hear the record, and they're gonna love it because it's great, because you're great.<eos> But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
I agree, Holy Father.<eos> In Greenland, we Catholics are like the native Americans.<eos> We got there first and then we were confined to reservations.<eos> I agree, Holy Father.<eos> You are a woman who tends to agree.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Madame Prime Minister. I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
Keep your mind focused on your task.<eos> Don't forget, I still need a copy of Hewlett's encrypting plate.<eos> I need a sample of Major André's handwriting.<eos> I need them both so I can plant that letter.<eos> - I will... - Hewlett must believe that André has no interest in meeting me.<eos> Otherwise this is...<eos> this is all for nothing.<eos> I will, Abe, I will.<eos> - But if your father sees this...<eos> - He won't.
Lure him out of hiding.<eos> And I know exactly where we do it.<eos> A Downworld rave.<eos> - Nice, Izzy.<eos> - And where'd you get that?<eos> During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it.<eos> Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
I'll turn into a...<eos> What if I attack you after I turn?<eos> If I hurt you...<eos> I couldn't live with myself.<eos> You don't wanna hurt me.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Your death...<eos> I couldn't survive that.<eos> Jocelyn, you have to go.<eos> I won't.
King John was the first King of England to be accused of murder.<eos> Ivan the Terrible massacred thousands.<eos> King Herod ordered the killing of every male infant under the age of two...<eos> ..and if Jesus Christ himself hadn't been slumming it in a manger... he would have slaughtered him too because a younger, faster king was coming to take what he had.<eos> You think this place is made of wood and stone?<eos> It's built on blood.<eos> Every empire is.<eos> I'm sorry about Violet.<eos> I hope she comes home.<eos> She won't.
And then we're not.<eos> I'm leaving now, Helena.<eos> Wouldn't you like to apologize for your outburst before I go?<eos> I'm taking away your title, your staff and your royal stipend.<eos> Like hell you are!<eos> It's either that or you'll be wearing orange for the rest of your days.<eos> Orange, Mother.<eos> With no accessories.<eos> You have had 30 years to make that call and we both know that you're not going to do it.<eos> But I will.
Well, I learned it from my dad.<eos> Proud of you, honey.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> My wife doesn't seem to remember me.<eos> Because until we return your younger selves to the timeline, you... none of you will have ever existed.<eos> But we will return you.<eos> When we left 2016, I just assumed I would return to the exact moment I left, that Clarissa wouldn't even know I was gone.<eos> So I didn't say good-bye.<eos> And now I fear I will never have that chance.<eos> You will.
Do they hate each other? No.<eos> They love each other.<eos> If you try to fight these people, you only put us at risk.<eos> We've been safe here for months.<eos> - We're making a home.<eos> - We're hiding.<eos> Like we always have.<eos> You're the one putting us at risk. Being around humans.<eos> One slip, and you'll give us away. Someone'll see through the dumb synth act.<eos> No, they won't.
Oh. Hey, Emma.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wow, it's like an ex-girlfriend convention in here.<eos> Want me to call Hayley?<eos> Maybe she can come over.<eos> And you have to tell everyone how they're selling kids into these privatized foster homes.<eos> Yeah, I know about these places.<eos> My friend Kiara was in one of them.<eos> Then why aren't you saying anything about it?<eos> I... I will.
I don't think so.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.
Got it.<eos> - Thanks, Mom.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.<eos> I will.
In exchange, you will find out whose body the Master has taken.<eos> He is no longer in Bolivar's body?<eos> So he has lost faith in you.<eos> Should I question your ability to do this?<eos> No-no, I can do it.<eos> He still needs me. Of that, I am certain.<eos> Otherwise, I would already be dead.<eos> You can find him?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> I will.
Yes, I've heard Mr. Desai speaking to someone about that.<eos> He offloaded the cargo without my permission.<eos> I need to know where.<eos> Time is a critical factor.<eos> I'll have the information for you by end of day.<eos> This my personal number.<eos> Call me as soon as you know something.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> I can't believe Mr. Desai thought he could get away with this.<eos> He won't.
It's Duval. He's real worked up.<eos> I've never seen him like this before.<eos> Yes, I'll hold.<eos> It's Gracie.<eos> I think I told her something I shouldn't have.<eos> I know I have no warrant, but I need you to find this boy's phone.<eos> Because I am in the middle of a multiple homicide, and I am asking you to do it as a favor for me.<eos> There's a video message from Gracie.<eos> Just press the play button.<eos> Yes, I will.
You're a beautiful, beautiful man, but this was never supposed to get serious.<eos> I asked her once if he was mine.<eos> She said:<eos> "No, I'm certain."<eos> As Jesse got older, I'd look at him. I could see it.<eos> I knew, he was mine.<eos> Then, that day in the park happened... Ah, just go!<eos> What are we gonna do? - Suppose Jesse tells.<eos> - He won't. I'll make sure of it.<eos> And neither will we.
And when you're wed and you leave this home, you'll break my heart.<eos> I will beg for word from you... for a letter, for a visit... just as I am begging for your forgiveness now.<eos> Fine.<eos> I won't tell them of how you poisoned me...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - If... you convince Charles to allow me to choose my own husband.<eos> Since when did you want to get married?<eos> I am only saying, if I were to get married, I want to choose the man.<eos> Will you speak to the king?<eos> I will.
It could be any number of things.<eos> Yeah. All right.<eos> I just looked, I mean,<eos> Iris could have died tonight.<eos> She's gonna be okay, Barry.<eos> You know, this time, but the fact is, she is hurt right now because of me.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris just from some meta-human tonight.<eos> When Zoom attacks again, I need all of my speed and then some.<eos> I can't lose anyone else.<eos> You won't.
This is yours?<eos> I-I came in for some kindling.<eos> I wasn't stealing.<eos> Get out.<eos> I ain't gon' tell nobody.<eos> Get out!<eos> Kizzy, I swear!<eos> ♪ When I rise ♪ Kizzy, it's been a while now.<eos> And I ain't told nobody, just like I said.<eos> And I won't.
After this is all over... if we don't end up seeing each other much, if... this is just a moment in time...<eos> I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you.<eos> Why wouldn't... why wouldn't we...<eos> Don't you want to see each other?<eos> It's just...<eos> Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay,<eos> - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
Doesn't serve the virus to kill its host so quickly.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> A smart virus keeps its host alive.<eos> Hepatitis, polio, HIV.<eos> Beautiful, evolved viruses.<eos> This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
They were onto the exact same thing.<eos> Which means they could have exactly what we're looking for.<eos> How could I have missed this?<eos> I've seen it 100 times.<eos> You were focused on your friends.<eos> But I'm supposed to meet Lommers soon.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> We owe them.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> We will.
I want it to.<eos> Do you have a mom?<eos> I did.<eos> She died.<eos> Was it awful?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was awful.<eos> And I tried to be strong, but I-I kind of fell apart.<eos> I won't do that.<eos> You won't?
I'm scared.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Go on.<eos> As far away as you can.<eos> Before anyone else sees, go on.<eos> - Thank you. Thank you, Neil.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> You're such a good friend.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
Don't you ever knock?<eos> You tried to seduce Mr. Powell? !<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I was following your advice.<eos> My advice?<eos> You said always blackmail for something good, so I made a deal.<eos> I seduce Mrs. Powell's husband and she introduces me to a music producer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mrs. Powell knows a music producer?<eos> Yep, and now I will, too.
I haven't seen him in 20 years.<eos> But it's the first man I ever loved.<eos> Probably the only man.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> You do?<eos> In a way.<eos> Adrian was my first and only love.<eos> And the night of the explosion, when I thought he'd died, I was devastated.<eos> If you repeat this, I will throttle you.<eos> I won't.
Here's a ha'penny for yourself.<eos> You sent my son to the pawnbroker?<eos> No.<eos> Only once or twice.<eos> And only to pawn things of mine.<eos> And he wasn't supposed to tell anyone.<eos> You made an innocent child pawn his dead mother's lace.<eos> That was meant for the sister that he's lost.<eos> I'll make it up to you.<eos> I will.
You need to talk to them.<eos> No, I told, I told them I'm out.<eos> I've already got a target on my back.<eos> What do you mean you have a target on your back?<eos> Just tell them to drop it.<eos> Go on with your lives without the plan, without me.<eos> They're going after Red Tyson.<eos> Okay, they already started looking for him.<eos> What if they stir up something about what we did to him?<eos> They won't, they won't.
I see Spiros has been teaching you.<eos> In England, we say "bastard".<eos> Barsto?<eos> - Bastard.<eos> - Barsto.<eos> I love him, Mum.<eos> Oh, Gerry, take it outside.<eos> Gerry, take him outside, now!<eos> - He'll escape.<eos> - Not for a while, he won't.
Like that but more funny!<eos> OK, OK.<eos> I am tired of you living it up while we struggle.<eos> - Help us.<eos> - I was helping.<eos> By being one less mouth to feed.<eos> Is that the best you can come up with?<eos> I sent my short story to England.<eos> - That will bring us a tidy sum. - No.<eos> No, it won't.
- Rose, tell me.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> No, Rose.<eos> Wes, please, I-I know you're in there because I can see the light on.<eos> Wes?<eos> He doesn't own me or Christophe.<eos> We are not things to be owned and used and thrown away.<eos> I was born free, I will stay free... so will Christophe!<eos> You tell him that.<eos> Okay. I will.
You too sedated to pop that thing?<eos> You got to pop it!<eos> Pop, pop! Come on, now.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> 'Cause I'm the one she'd ask to do it.<eos> Tell me you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> I won't.
Because, Barry, I need you to know that it doesn't matter to me if you're The Flash or not.<eos> You, Barry... that's who I want to see if I have a future with.<eos> I mean... if you still want that too, of course.<eos> I should go see if Jesse and Wally need anything.<eos> Come on.<eos> And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
And then I called to talk to you about it and you basically hung up on me.<eos> You know, why don't you let me talk to the client?<eos> Oh, no, that time has passed.<eos> I'm sorry, Meg.<eos> This isn't working out.<eos> Susannah, it was a family emergency.<eos> My brother was in bad shape. I had to be here.<eos> Yes, and I'm sorry about that. But it isn't our problem.<eos> I promise it will never happen again.<eos> - No, it won't.
I thought you were dead.<eos> You were supposed to.<eos> Put the rifle down, now.<eos> Or what-- you just gonna shoot me?<eos> Arrest me?<eos> You think I won't tell everybody about him?<eos> I'm assuming you'd prefer to keep it a secret.<eos> No one's gonna believe you.<eos> Somebody will.<eos> Graydal will, maybe even DHS.
The question is what did Columbia have that they don't want us to know they had?<eos> Which is why this asset is the key.<eos> If we can extract them, we can question them before we deliver them to the Voice and figure out what the Voice is planning once and for all.<eos> We'd better, because if we don't, we just helped a terrorist put the final piece in place of whatever it is they're planning.<eos> Two CIA operatives are escorting the asset to a safe house as we speak.<eos> You'll need a partner.<eos> Nimah Amin.<eos> I trust her.<eos> You'll have 10 minutes with the asset, so ask the right questions.<eos> I will.
- Who?<eos> - The other girl.<eos> - What about her?<eos> - She doesn't love me.<eos> - What are you trying to say?<eos> - She doesn't love me!<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> - No.<eos> No I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will.
In an asylum.<eos> Then she'll be declared mentally unfit,<eos> I'll be granted my divorce, and you and I can wed.<eos> The only part of this that I feel good about is being with you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you.<eos> You loved me.<eos> You lied.<eos> You can't do this to me.<eos> You won't.
There were rumors that...<eos> Everybody thought they were true.<eos> He tried to kill me, but I survived the attack.<eos> I've been a prisoner ever since.<eos> I never thought I'd see him again.<eos> How did you survive what he did to you?<eos> Jocelyn pulled me through.<eos> You were there.<eos> Did he hurt her?<eos> No, and he won't.
Something's happening.<eos> It's not holding.<eos> Talk to us.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Killian!<eos> He doesn't know we came for him. We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> And, Emma, we will find him.<eos> Will we?
I did, but certain protocols were set to activate<eos> - upon Keen's arrest.<eos> - What kind of protocols?<eos> Cynthia Panabaker kind.<eos> Yeah. She's White House Counsel, and a real pain in the ass.<eos> She's drafted an executive order mandating Keen's transport to the Federal Courthouse for a closed hearing - with Judge Trotter.<eos> - How much time do we have?<eos> Three hours, maybe less, Peter.<eos> If she tells her story in open court, then--<eos> She won't.
There's someone who can save Agent Keen?<eos> Karakurt.<eos> Cooper's hiding him at a cabin near Lake Yvonne.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> I gotta get him to move Karakurt before the Director's goons get there.<eos> Go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.<eos> What if they figure out the code?<eos> - They won't.
- You know what, let me answer that.<eos> The position will be coming with stock options.<eos> When I was a teenager, I crashed my father's Hudson Super and blamed it on a Chinese.<eos> Okay, and what about your three greatest weaknesses?<eos> If you don't believe me, then why don't you go check the tapes, okay?<eos> Just check the tapes, man.<eos> It's all in the tapes.<eos> Check the tapes.<eos> Check the tapes. check the tapes.<eos> Yeah, all right, we will.
Oh, I see.<eos> It's the suit, right?<eos> Well, you can have it.<eos> Yeah, I think it'll look, uh, a lot nicer than that late-'90s trench coat you're wearing.<eos> I'm afraid your brother might not be joining us.<eos> I can see him through Zolo's eyes.<eos> Burning, burning in the desert sun.<eos> We might smell his ashes in the wind.<eos> It's too bad you won't be seeing Amaru's true beauty.<eos> But I will... through your eyes.
Is that what La Diosa teaches you?<eos> Defiance?<eos> Jesus, man.<eos> What the fuck are you?<eos> A messenger.<eos> To stop a plague like Santanico, you can't just destroy the source.<eos> You have to incinerate every single soul she's infected.<eos> Yo, man, how 'bout you suck my...<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
And when it's dead... you two will leave, and never come back.<eos> CULEBRA WOMAN: Nobody is safe any more.<eos> Araseli.<eos> That's a pretty name.<eos> So, the man who came here was after the culebra priest that runs this den?<eos> First, they destroy our leaders.<eos> Now they're going after our faith.<eos> (sobbing) He said La Diosa was a plague.<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
He's talking about his shipment, all right?<eos> That motherfucker said we're going back to work for him to pay him back.<eos> You want to get back to hustling? I have to.<eos> How exactly are you planning on pulling it off living with a fed?<eos> You're gonna have to wake up with her every morning... and lie to her, lie to her all God damn day, lie to her every night.<eos> It's never gonna fucking work.<eos> So you're saying I can't pull it off?<eos> No, she took you back because she thought that you was clean.<eos> As soon as she finds out that you got back in the game, she gonna turn you in.<eos> No, she won't.
What's wrong?<eos> Princess Snow, you must stop him.<eos> The bandit and his men... they're terrorizing our villages and roads.<eos> But my father... he's on a diplomatic mission.<eos> I'll send word to him.<eos> By the time it reaches him, we will all be dead.<eos> We need help now.<eos> Fear not.<eos> My stepdaughter will take care of all of you.<eos> I will?
Thank you for the tip, Raymond.<eos> The families, theirs and ours, we're getting together tomorrow.<eos> It'd be nice to have a friendly face.<eos> I'd rather die than have an Eriksson touch my little girl.<eos> So would I.<eos> But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Help us!<eos> Want to play? My name is Adam Warren!<eos> Help us! Help me!<eos> I tried that.<eos> No one can hear us.<eos> Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yes, they will.
Well, she's sick and she doesn't like you...<eos> For now.<eos> I'm Switzerland here.<eos> But you did call her out for telling everyone about Tony before you.<eos> - Not everyone-everyone.<eos> - No recap needed.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just try getting in touch,<eos> - see if she responds to you.<eos> - Uh, hello? Of course she will.
This is an interrogation.<eos> Ergo, no talking.<eos> The Nose talked.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Said you made threats and hired a thug to take his nose out of commission.<eos> I merely mentioned breach of contract.<eos> What happened to his nose is just either bad luck or happy accident.<eos> Depending on your point of view.<eos> Okay, don't talk.<eos> Maybe Vernon Caldasso will.
- Right.<eos> Sometimes things don't work out that way.<eos> Sometimes the bad guys need a nudge... a push to do the thing that you want to catch them doing.<eos> You might even supply them with blueprints to the building so they know where to park the trucks with the bombs.<eos> Sometimes agents keep their mouth shut when they're told to.<eos> Someday, you'll do the same thing, and if you ever cross that line, you better hope that you bust them before they actually push that button.<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> A-Are you saying that...<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> And no one ever will.
Don't get cocky.<eos> This is the first time you'll be testifying in court, and it can get nerve-racking.<eos> I'll be fine, especially since word on the street is the defense lawyer is a total hack.<eos> Oh, yeah? Who is it?<eos> Stan Novak.<eos> "Short attention span" Stan?<eos> That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations.<eos> Yeah. You will be fine.<eos> Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.<eos> - No, but I will.
She's gonna be coming for me.<eos> I need to find some salt.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Am I in danger?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Witch.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> John, John, John... didn't I blow you up with a motorbike?<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't take.<eos> This one will.
Would you like to see that?<eos> W-Well...<eos> I would love that, but...<eos> I have responsibilities here.<eos> An ailing child.<eos> Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
Alison, why are you here?<eos> You haven't been answering your calls, mister.<eos> Do you even know that your family's back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're alright, aren't they?<eos> Yes, but that's not the point.<eos> - Why didn't you go meet them?<eos> - 'Cause I'm in the zone.<eos> - They can come to me. - You have to tell them what you've been up to.<eos> I will.
Keep walking.<eos> I said keep walking!<eos> It's okay.<eos> What?<eos> It's okay if you do it.<eos> I get it.<eos> Hell, I want you to. Please.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Keep walking. I can't go back.<eos> You will.
We're better off staying underground as long as we can.<eos> These things down here...<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Susan, listen.<eos> If something happens, ok, if we get split up or whatever and you find Dylan before me,<eos> I just...<eos> I need you... I need you to tell her that I'm alive.<eos> And that I'm searching for her.<eos> And that I will find her.<eos> Ok? I will.
You're saying Bobo's hiding revenants in the trailer park?<eos> I'm only speculating on a hypothesis.<eos> All right, I get it. But let's just say, hypothetically, that I was looking for a certain revenant, let's call him Father Malick, should I look in the trailer park?<eos> Hypothetically?<eos> I'd say yep.<eos> So who told you Malick's here?<eos> Not at liberty to discuss.<eos> So it's your friend Henry?<eos> One of these days I'm gonna have - to meet this guy, right?<eos> - One of these days you will.
But I didn't have any other choice.<eos> I had to do what I could in order to save us.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> And now you're both going to pay.<eos> You can remove them now.<eos> It's time to walk the plank.<eos> I'll gladly walk it. Just spare Killian, please.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> He should've gone down along with the ship, like the rest of us.<eos> And now he finally will.
I didn't want to.<eos> - I didn't mean to.<eos> - Very well.<eos> If you insist.<eos> No, please, please, I beg you, no.<eos> Don't. Please, please.<eos> Something's gone wrong, Dolores.<eos> How could I have done this?<eos> I can't.<eos> - I won't.
- It's not your job...<eos> - The hell it isn't.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know that.<eos> Here's what I know.<eos> We see heartbreak every day.<eos> And we live our lives imperfectly as a result of that.<eos> You're a human being, Randy, and there is no shame in that.<eos> I should've told her.<eos> Next time you will.
I'm j-just gonna say that he passed away.<eos> Father Benedict asked if, uh, someone was gonna speak at the service.<eos> Well, that's up to you.<eos> Well, I'd... be too emotional, too sappy.<eos> Dad would hate that.<eos> I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
How can I not appear with my keynote speaker? !<eos> This arms deal creates 5,000 new jobs, most of them in swing states.<eos> But by all means, you tell the president you want to put that at risk so you can get your picture taken with a teenager.<eos> She's 20, and neither one of us is even worthy enough to shine her shoes, so don't strong-arm me, Russell.<eos> Once the arms deal goes through, the two of you can go on Amazing Race if you want to.<eos> Just lay low, avoid the cameras.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get word to Prince Asim.<eos> No, I will.
Justice has finally come for your friend.<eos> Pray it hasn't come for you, too.<eos> Why don't you lose your mask?<eos> You're not as scary as you think.<eos> Twelve hours from the exact time the last alien was kidnapped to his time of death.<eos> Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> -We have to find her.<eos> -And we will.
According to this, it's the only way to get that thing off.<eos> Okay, here we go. - Hold him.<eos> - I got him.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> Well, what if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
Shut up!<eos> Este hombre es un...<eos> How do you say "pedophile" in Spanish?<eos> Pedofilo.<eos> ...pedofilo!<eos> Cuff him.<eos> Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.<eos> so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.<eos> This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.<eos> Of course it will.
Oh, shit. I thought she was over that. So did I.<eos> - Hey, Lucy. - Hello.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry. I got nervous, and...<eos> I- - I apologize.<eos> No need to apologize. So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free. I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again. Mm.<eos> It won't. Okay.
Jason would like to speak with you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll be waiting for you.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> The rebellion is over.<eos> We need to start fresh.<eos> I was hoping you could come up to the mountain, share a meal with me, talk about the future of Wayward Pines.<eos> You need to tell me what's happening here.<eos> Everything.<eos> I will.
It was very stressful for her.<eos> Yeah. All right, tell me about this patient.<eos> Okay, so, he was in a car accident.<eos> Severely fractured arm, lung cancer, and as soon as I discharge him, he's going to jail.<eos> Oh, and his wife just left him.<eos> Ooh, sounds like a country song.<eos> - Yeah. Pretty hopeless case. - Hmm.<eos> Well, the one thing he's got going for him.<eos> At least in prison, he'll get the treatment that he needs.<eos> Yeah, he will.
It's not all right.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not fooled.<eos> Stop dumping me.<eos> Do you know how many times you've dumped me?<eos> I have to hear from you if it was a confession of your feelings or not. So stop running away.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> So let go of me.<eos> - I really will.
- Why not?<eos> You fired me.<eos> And I've never worked there.<eos> We want you back.<eos> And we want you to come with her.<eos> Diane does?<eos> Well, she understands the situation.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not interested.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
- Roofies?<eos> - You want roofies?<eos> - Is that something you can access?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But that would be quadruple.<eos> That's four... times.<eos> Ha. Speak tomorrow.<eos> Maybe.<eos> No maybe.<eos> We will.
I thought I was your apprentice.<eos> You are, Tommy, but you are tethered to Ghost.<eos> Ghost is an attachment, and attachments are bad for business if you want to stay alive.<eos> I'll handle Ghost.<eos> Hey, Bob, can you do some digging for me?<eos> I got a serial number of a possible burner.<eos> I was trying to find the phone number attached to it.<eos> - A burner?<eos> - Yeah, and the phone call, text history... you know, whatever you can do.<eos> Okay, sure. I'll...
Is this the murdered man Ratovski?<eos> What is this?<eos> What is this mapping?<eos> What is it you make here?<eos> A history... of the frozen and famished journeys made by those of my faith, that they might find shelter in Whitechapel.<eos> Ratovski's journey amongst?<eos> Ratovski?<eos> What of him?<eos> Show me. Show me!<eos> No, sir, I will not.
They can sense other Hunters.<eos> - Through the walls?<eos> - Walls don't stop our language.<eos> That won't stop them either. Give me my gun.<eos> Fine, you can do it, shoot me.<eos> Right here. It'll be painful but I'll survive.<eos> They need to think that I put up a fight, and that's how you escaped.<eos> Do it and go.<eos> I could kill you.<eos> You won't.
You're in danger.<eos> You take a walk and get some fresh air.<eos> Okay? I'm not asking you.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> If anything occurs, you'll contact me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
No, we don't-- we don't- - Hey. We don't let up.<eos> We don't let up.<eos> We keep pushing, right?<eos> Never get soft.<eos> But you got to enjoy this. You know?<eos> It's not easy doing what we do.<eos> Fucking hard-earned.<eos> All right?<eos> I want you to embrace the moment, Alicia.<eos> I will.
A lot of people died today.<eos> A lot of good, talented Powers, but not you.<eos> You did something none of the others could.<eos> You got away.<eos> I ran away.<eos> No, you flew away, like a Power, but now there are people that need your help.<eos> Your fellow Powers need you.<eos> I can't. I... I can't.<eos> Calista, I would give anything to have my powers back and get out there and stop this, but I don't have them.<eos> I never will.
Seriously.<eos> Well, that more than makes up for last time.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Time for you to start thinking about settling down.<eos> When are you gonna pop the question? Hmm.<eos> Voters need a married man with a happy family.<eos> I don't have a family, happy or otherwise.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
It shows us the exact location of every device in the world connected to the Internet, including that camera you're staring into.<eos> And we can use the Shodan Map to find you, but I'm gonna need the make and model of that camera.<eos> The only person who can get me that information is you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Grace, we need you to try and reach the camera and give us the make and model.<eos> That information will help us find you.<eos> But, Avery, I would have to drop the switch.<eos> - I mean, wouldn't that kill me?<eos> - No.<eos> No, Grace, it won't.
And foot soldiers do one very simple thing...<eos> They follow orders.<eos> Agent Ramos recommends four weeks' psych leave.<eos> And you know I don't take his evaluations lightly.<eos> You were also there.<eos> I was in my room.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> You were smack in the middle. You owe yourself some time.<eos> I can't go away for a month.<eos> I won't.
Sonia and I are the same size.<eos> - Similar cheekbones too. - Mm-hmm.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I put on her clothes, I do my hair, I get in her car, that dickbag follows me, and I'll take him somewhere quiet.<eos> And then what?<eos> You know what.<eos> You know, she actually does look a lot like her.<eos> What if he gets the drop on you?<eos> He won't.
Yes, Mother, I know how it works.<eos> I have dabbled with forgetting potions before.<eos> As have I.<eos> In fact, there was a spring from this very river near our estate in the Enchanted Forest.<eos> Who did you use it on?<eos> That's not important.<eos> What is important is that you find a way to get Zelena to drink this.<eos> Good luck there.<eos> After I crashed her date, I don't think she'll let me within a mile of her farmhouse.<eos> She will.
I've got a meeting to get to.<eos> Joanne...<eos> Dennis...<eos> Jennifer.<eos> All these victims.<eos> So long ago.<eos> You know you're gonna get life for the murder of Adrian, don't you?<eos> And then you'll just be forgotten.<eos> Maddy won't forget me.<eos> Oh, she will.
The whole cover story they made up-- shadowing your unit, seeing how you do things, why you've had the success you've had-- it worked, because it's the truth.<eos> And what you're doing with Five-O, you're making a difference.<eos> What are you gonna do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was under Coughlin's supervision. San Francisco PD considers what I did an act of insubordination.<eos> If I go back, they'll take my shield.<eos> Reassign me to patrol.<eos> I guess you better stay here then, help us.<eos> Why don't you think about it?<eos> I will.
If the Queen dies, are we to be ruled by a German?<eos> We already are.<eos> Cumberland would crawl over broken glass for a crack at the Regency.<eos> Parliament, of course, must ratify.<eos> Of course it must.<eos> I hear you are already acquainted with the Prince, Peel.<eos> The Queen is stubborn.<eos> You must convince Albert to reconsider.<eos> If the Tories fail to condone your Regency... ..I will abdicate.<eos> No, you will not. I will.
- Just observing.<eos> - Be careful, Eli.<eos> I have the full resources of the FBI and the Justice Department behind me on this, and we always get what we're after.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard about the hearing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, looks like we're headed towards a summer trial.<eos> Well, on the upside, Howell can at least make bail.<eos> He doesn't have $250,000.<eos> He will now.
Sex?<eos> Is the Kama Sutra that good?<eos> Or was she that unhappy?<eos> Tomorrow morning, early... you will leave for Russia... to begin a new life.<eos> Russia?<eos> I know it's not easy.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
Rosalyn's murder will in all likelihood doom the project, which is exactly what O'Neal wanted.<eos> A single theory to explain both homicides has yet to present itself.<eos> Could be we're looking at two killers.<eos> Some kind of turf war.<eos> Hull's side kills an activist, so the activists kill his building.<eos> Throwing Mrs. Graham from her balcony seems too circuitous a route for revenge.<eos> Then keep it simple.<eos> O'Neal was trying to stop William Hull's building.<eos> Anyone check Hull's shoe size?<eos> No, but I will.
She doesn't understand what we're saying.<eos> Nobody here has any idea what we're saying.<eos> Well, here's to our one-year anniversary of chasing red pins around the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One year of complete and total... failure.<eos> Hey, it's not complete failure.<eos> While we have not solved your scar situation yet, we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols.<eos> I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope, he never will.
but friendship is something awesome, don't forget it.<eos> And if you have no friends at 40... well, get busy because friends will save you.<eos> Only them.<eos> I don't like this development.<eos> What development?<eos> It's a suspension.<eos> I'll be back at school in two days.<eos> A suspension is a suspension.<eos> - What if they fail you again?<eos> - No, they won't.
All right, see you later.<eos> Teach? You don't need to worry about me,<eos> I'm stronger than them. I am.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Did you miss us?<eos> - Sure, like crazy.<eos> Hi Blu, how are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Grandma says hi and wants you to visit her.<eos> I will one of these days, okay?
What's going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I...<eos> What the fuck do you mean, you don't know?<eos> You told me we were safe.<eos> We were.<eos> And now?<eos> Jesus, John. Talk to me.<eos> Listen to me. I'll take care of this, all right?<eos> Yeah, you will.
- General Gaghan.<eos> - Majesty.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I heard what you said.<eos> Why didn't you tell him those anarchists are the Red Knights?<eos> And remind him we killed the last group of soldiers we couldn't pay?<eos> No.<eos> First we pay the army, then we crush the Red Knights.<eos> But we don't have the money.<eos> We will.
It doesn't change anything.<eos> It's over. We both know it.<eos> - But Mom... - No, no.<eos> No. No lectures.<eos> This is not a lecture.<eos> Dad is holding out hope.<eos> He thinks you might change your mind.<eos> About kids.<eos> He does?<eos> I won't.
I don't remember, The...<eos> The Eden something.<eos> Norma, just leave...<eos> Leave him alone, okay?<eos> Things are good, all right?<eos> Alex is good. Norman's getting better.<eos> You don't need to check up on Caleb.<eos> This is... this is coming from some sort of wrong place, all right?<eos> Just don't... Don't do something destructive.<eos> I won't.
We did do a pharmacogenomics, and it will only respond to doxorubicin.<eos> How will that affect the other twin?<eos> Emily has class 3 heart failure.<eos> That's why she's always out of breath.<eos> Doxorubicin is a cardiotoxic.<eos> It's gonna tip her into end stage heart failure.<eos> That'll kill her.<eos> And if we don't operate?<eos> Beth's gonna die from the cancer.<eos> And then so will her sister.
Forgive me.<eos> I must, um, take refuge of my own between my sheets.<eos> You.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I don't need charity!<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Was that charity?<eos> I just wanted to stop anyone else from getting hurt.<eos> I know.<eos> You will.
Where is everyone else?<eos> Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.<eos> It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.<eos> - It was her fault.<eos> - It was his fault.<eos> No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.<eos> Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.<eos> No, give me another chance.<eos> I will find Phillip's killer.<eos> She won't.
It's a joke, dude.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry if you're homesick.<eos> Oh, no. I'm not homesick, Julian.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't.
She has a reputation for bewitching men.<eos> Did you fall under Mary's spell?<eos> Honestly?<eos> There were times where I could envision falling in love with the queen of Scots, but not in this life.<eos> You are my queen.<eos> I was born an Englishman and I will die an Englishman.<eos> I have decided to reward your service with a position here at court.<eos> I will be giving you the chance to work closely with me from now on.<eos> Do not make me regret that choice.<eos> You won't, Your Majesty.
But I'll tell you what, one last thing though.<eos> You know those, um... oh, gosh, those blueberry-lemon muffins at Angelina's that I love?<eos> - Do you want a muffin?<eos> - No. All right, just two.<eos> You know what?<eos> Get four.<eos> And then whatever you want, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> You have to ask, not me.<eos> - I will.
He said that?<eos> - Did he...<eos> - I tried to tell him how valuable you were, but you know him.<eos> He just... doesn't listen, does he?<eos> He's giving you a death sentence.<eos> You can't sit still for that.<eos> I'm sure I can find a way...<eos> Take him out.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
Don't even.<eos> "Have fun with your girlfriend?"<eos> What kind of stupid exit line was that?<eos> Move!<eos> Who's that?<eos> Gus is getting an offer to buy the bar.<eos> I know!<eos> She can't do that, can she, Wyn?<eos> I mean, she wouldn't, right, she couldn't...<eos> She won't.
Guns at the ready?<eos> Vercoe... would you mind?<eos> More light!<eos> Are you shivering, my precious?<eos> Perhaps we should go inside before you catch a chill.<eos> They let you go!<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I must go to Caroline.<eos> Pray God she'll understand.<eos> Of course she will.
I promise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
Good.<eos> Is it nearly time?<eos> Adie, I think, um...<eos> Well, I've been thinking for a long time now -<eos> I think we should stop...<eos> I mean, I want to stop.<eos> A lot's changing this week and the kids and I, we need to move on.<eos> I just need some space to be me now or, at least, try.<eos> Are you keeping up the memory exercise?<eos> Yes, and I will.
Julio was late last week because of your little home visit.<eos> what's next?<eos> Well, i'll tell you.<eos> He'll be running off to the school. He'll be going to the doctor's office In the middle of the day,<eos> How many more kids are you going to dump on us?<eos> I thought you liked rusty.<eos> I do, but that's the problem.<eos> He is an enormous emotional distraction.<eos> You think julio's priorities will change?<eos> Well, of course they will,
Jordan graff...<eos> Why have we not heard about him?<eos> Or Dwight's father?<eos> - In his notes, Dr. Joe says that Dwight was probably trying to get attention from graff because he idealized him and seemed delusional on the subject of his father, ma'am.<eos> It says here Dwight is estranged from his mother, wildred Darnell, also her maiden name.<eos> Uh, we're very near the end of the session.<eos> Please, let's get it over with.<eos> Oh, yes, go ahead.<eos> Well, maybe your father will show up for you at the trial.<eos> - Maybe he will.
It really is funny.<eos> She didn't think your date was a date, and she kind of hinted pretty heavily that if I was free, she would want to date me.<eos> How big is your ego?<eos> Can't you believe for one second that given a choice, someone might actually like me better?<eos> Yeah, I guess that'd be possible.<eos> Possible?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just didn't want your feelings to get hurt.<eos> If you don't believe me, you can ask her.<eos> Oh. Oh, I will.
Feel with the heart that Allah gave you.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> We're gonna get that thing off of you, okay?<eos> Deeks, send up the bomb squad.<eos> T-Take it off me, too.<eos> Kensi, send 'em up now.<eos> I-I don't want to die.<eos> Take this vest off me.<eos> We will.
I-I don't want to die.<eos> Take this vest off me.<eos> We will.<eos> Bomb squad is two seconds away.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> You said we had families?<eos> Is that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't let me die.<eos> I won't.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've just been informed that due to popular demand, one more beast show has been added for this afternoon.<eos> That was me!<eos> I was the popular demand! Boom. Yeah!<eos> Let's get to the box office and snaffle some good seats.<eos> As a result, we'll be needing more prisoners so those people just mentioned will no longer have to pay a fine...<eos> What? This gets better and better.<eos> Hang on. ..as they will now be sentenced to death by wild beasts in the arena.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Well, you wanted to see the beasts.<eos> Now you will. Right up close.
Ali's the one who needs help now.<eos> No, he's not gonna get away with this.<eos> Elliott will pay for what he did to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
She's pretty beat up.<eos> Well, I found/stole my mom's key card.<eos> So we need to use it before anybody notices it's missing.<eos> - So, like, now.<eos> - I'm sorry, Hanna.<eos> I promised Toby that I would stay here at the hospital.<eos> It's fine. Just get here when you can.<eos> Tell Toby I'm thinking of them.<eos> I'll let you know what I find.<eos> I will.
My name's Marcella Backland.<eos> You know my husband (! )<eos> Headmistress called me.<eos> Did she tell you what it was about?<eos> Just said it was important.<eos> - You seem stressed.<eos> - Well, I am stressed!<eos> We will be curtailing Emma's privileges for the next few weeks.<eos> And we'd like the two of you to talk with her so she understands the gravity of the situation.<eos> We will.
He went to Grace's.<eos> Came back expecting the pub to be open till its usual 1am.<eos> But it closed at 11.<eos> Laura, he left his phone in the pub so he'd have an alibi if we traced it.<eos> Well?<eos> Can we go after him now?<eos> This is Rav's investigation.<eos> If he doesn't want to pursue it, I can't make him.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - But I won't.
You know that, right?<eos> We love you, too.<eos> All right, girls. It's time to go back to bed, okay?<eos> Daddy's got to talk to Mommy.<eos> I'll tuck you in a little bit, all right?<eos> Come home, Caroline.<eos> - We'll deal with this.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
- - Fuck! You scared me!<eos> I got breakfast, come sit down.<eos> Look what the Mink came up with.<eos> I gotta find the bastards who beat me.<eos> Go talk to Acke.<eos> Yes, yes... I'll talk to Acke. The favors are starting to pile up.<eos> What does the Mink get out of this? You used to slip some cash once.<eos> Do I look like I got cash on me?<eos> Will you talk to him then?<eos> - - Of course I will.
- Got it.<eos> Martha, we need to go.<eos> No!<eos> If you don't walk away from me right now...<eos> If you could go back with Martha, would you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'd understand.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will leave for Russia.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
No.<eos> It's not.<eos> Maurice is back on the bottle.<eos> So am I.<eos> Lisa...<eos> He took our money.<eos> All that money that's been coming in from you and Jack... he took it, ran off to Florida with some woman he met a month ago.<eos> Let's get to a meeting right now.<eos> I need to make things right.<eos> You will... we will.
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> I'm poz.<eos> Thomas isn't ready to date a poz guy.<eos> You can always come to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
Don't want you losing your whole foot.<eos> Yeah, you just don't want to carry me.<eos> What makes you so sure that your friends are gonna meet you in Caraquet?<eos> Before I took off from the compound, I left a message on the roof.<eos> A message?<eos> Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Mitch will.
Equal breath sounds.<eos> Symmetrical chest rise.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> He's secure.<eos> First unit's almost done.<eos> BP's coming up.<eos> See, Sean?<eos> I told you... We're gonna help you out.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't, okay?
Screw you!<eos> Now, Sergeant,<eos> I am offering you an opportunity here.<eos> I'm not owning up to this.<eos> You did this.<eos> Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot Private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
- I don't want to shoot, but I will if I have to, now drop it!<eos> Don't yell, Walt, okay?<eos> Please just lower your voice.<eos> You were supposed to leave the gun outside.<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> - You shot me.<eos> Was I supposed to trust you?<eos> Now let Donna go.<eos> - I can't let you hurt Dr. Monaghan.<eos> - I won't.
You just get everyone to safety, then come looking for us.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Neither do I,<eos> But you know I'm right.<eos> The react team could be here any minute.<eos> We don't have a minute.<eos> Eric, talk deeks to me.<eos> No matter what happens...<eos> Tahir does not get out of here alive.<eos> He won't.
He said he'd call round if he could.<eos> Now's a brilliant time.<eos> Dad just received some wonderful news.<eos> He's just telling Mum all about it.<eos> I've put in for as many Land Girls as we can afford.<eos> And the Irish boys will be back soon, so you shouldn't find yourself shorthanded.<eos> Don't let the Irish lads hold you to ransom.<eos> They know what we pay for the harvest.<eos> Don't let them take the piss.<eos> I won't.
That's great.<eos> What are you studying?<eos> I'm in business school.<eos> I wanna be a sports agent.<eos> I'm not just some dumb girl in a bikini.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Lots of people do.<eos> I'm only 21.<eos> And what happens if I end up in a wheelchair?<eos> You won't.
- Aah! Aah!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Get him prepped.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I just... I've been waiting a year to do something for this family besides write a check, and I finally have my shot, and I... and I...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Okay, hey, hey, hey.<eos> You're overthinking this.<eos> I put Malik in a wheelchair. I can't make him an orphan, too.<eos> You won't.
We're simply re-routing all of the traffic from Fost and Found to a website called Justice4Jack.<eos> I made up the name.<eos> Of course, it's not as good as Snakey the snake.<eos> And what's on Justice4Jack?<eos> A copy of the check that Arbiter wrote to Justina.<eos> You know, the for-profit organization that had Jack placed with Pearson and got him killed.<eos> And how'd you get this check?<eos> I would rather not say.<eos> What if they trace this back to you guys?<eos> They won't.
You can't go see him.<eos> - Yeah, I know!<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Mariana, you can't go see him.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> God. Well, then text him.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.
- Yeah, I know!<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Mariana, you can't go see him.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> God. Well, then text him.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will, Jesus!
Bishop, you stay here.<eos> McGee...<eos> I think I know where he might be headed, boss.<eos> Henry.<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> Well, if I were looking for Doyle, I'd go to the first place I saw him, too.<eos> He's not going to stop until he finds me.<eos> I just...<eos> He's not going to find you.<eos> Yes, he will.
The truth may be finding the light after all these years.<eos> Did you know that<eos> Harry Nilsson and John Lennon made a record together?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> I've got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Me too.<eos> Tell Jared I said hi.<eos> I will.
You have to poison a Six first, and then use the black goo to kill the pool. Let me calculate...<eos> just got to figure out the volume you're looking at.<eos> You don't need to do the calculation.<eos> We have enough.<eos> There'll be another way.<eos> In time. The Black Root are coming.<eos> Your John got lucky, but the next sortie will get through, and we'll have lost our chance.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You don't give a shit about the Quad!<eos> No, but Aneela will.
Shall we go to McDonald's?<eos> Can we go to Gröna Lund?<eos> - - Yes, even better!<eos> Perfect!<eos> Come on, the kid wants to go to Gröna Lund.<eos> We gonna make it.<eos> How are you, Acke?<eos> - - The kids who beat me...<eos> What if they come back?<eos> - - They will not!
You missed Tyler's funeral.<eos> Abandoning your friends in their time of need.<eos> That, my dear, is cold.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I'll still be here.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Remember, it's not Damon.<eos> This is Damon under the control of a she-devil.<eos> And we have to find a way to break her control.<eos> And we will.
You don't want to know.<eos> What about Enzo?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> He's unconscious.<eos> Stefan's still trying.<eos> She's been right in front of me the whole time.<eos> I-I should've noticed something.<eos> I-I should've felt something!<eos> We'll find them, okay?<eos> We will.
Get plastic surgeries to look younger... with you!<eos> And I wanna do all those things with you!<eos> But I also wanna be a father and have a family.<eos> Come on. We can be the parents we always wanted.<eos> Open, accepting, theater-camp friendly.<eos> Please, Elliot?<eos> One week!<eos> We'll try it for one week!<eos> - But if she does anything...<eos> - She won't!
It was me.<eos> It happened all like you said.<eos> Christi...<eos> I'm-I'm the one who did it, not Eric.<eos> I think he did it.<eos> You two realize that if you confess to this crime, there's a good chance you both will go to jail?<eos> Whatever we face, we face together.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The one of you who didn't do it, you'll lose everything.<eos> No, we won't.
I can.<eos> My name is Veronica.<eos> He told me he was a friend.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Maybe you can talk some sense into these two.<eos> Why?<eos> They're trying to break in there by themselves and free the synths.<eos> They're gonna get themselves killed.<eos> No, they won't.
That was on the other side of the world.<eos> This is here. Now. Today.<eos> It happens here every night.<eos> Try reading the Truth from time to time.<eos> So let's all fret about being dismissed by society and form a society that dismisses our own?<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> I won't see you later.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
- Are not.<eos> - I'm still in love with him.<eos> - Actually you're not.<eos> - I am.<eos> - Why are you saying this?<eos> Because it's a thing you tell people and I don't have that many people I can tell.<eos> Well, you aren't telling Dad. Absolutely not.<eos> Mmm... No.<eos> Mum, ab-so-lute-ly not.<eos> No, I won't, all right?
It would take decades to restore balance, if we even survive that long.<eos> Davies has said none of this.<eos> Well, somebody's been paying attention in class.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Sabine!<eos> Tasha!<eos> Get back!<eos> Tasha!<eos> We have to go back down there!<eos> We will, sir!
Mitch?<eos> Abe, listen to me, okay?<eos> I've been... a less than... stellar... father.<eos> There's an understatement, huh?<eos> I just want to do...<eos> If I can just do one thing, one... great thing for her before I die...<eos> Maybe... Maybe make the last thing I do in this world saving her life...<eos> You made the right call in New Brunswick.<eos> I need you to make it again.<eos> Okay. I will.
I've had him for three years.<eos> His heart rate rises every time he comes here. He's a nervous kid.<eos> - But this looks...<eos> - I looked at it. I saw the labs.<eos> I did my job, now do yours.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> Crap.<eos> You think DeLuca's gonna say anything?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
So this little guy is gonna get to meet his grandma after all.<eos> Take him to the NICU and page Karev.<eos> Um, Karev's in the clinic.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Uh, just take him to the NICU.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
Flora! Flora!<eos> I won't let you do that, you have to live your life.<eos> With or without me.<eos> I made a great big mess of my life, but those are my sins, not yours.<eos> Why won't anyone listen to me?<eos> This is what I want.<eos> What do you mean why won't anyone listen to you?<eos> Priscilla won't do it, she's afraid, but I told her it's okay.<eos> I'm gonna get one of the other ones to do it.<eos> No, you will not.
She seemed fine before, until she abandoned her daughter and checked herself into an institution.<eos> - I just don't trust her.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't think I ever will.<eos> I get it, Luisa.<eos> Nice shindig.<eos> Hey-hey! - Hey, man. - Look at you?<eos> Wow. I don't want to wake him up.<eos> You won't.
- "Dumb and Dumber To."<eos> - Jim Carrey?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I love him.<eos> - He is so funny.<eos> - He's a physical comedian.<eos> You can watch him on mute.<eos> - Oh, my God, - I love Jim Carrey.<eos> He's so watchable.<eos> I'll see y'all at "Selma."<eos> Yes, you will.
Hello, Todd.<eos> I applaud the effort, but I smelled your beard sweat from a hundred yards out.<eos> So, what did you think?<eos> I was just gonna slip up and let you follow me to the stuff?<eos> No.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> But I'm not showing you Jimmy Jack Corn.<eos> Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.<eos> We'll see, all right.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
Did you turn off the GPS?<eos> Very good.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Brian's parents are gonna be here in a few minutes.<eos> Can you sit in on the interview and just...<eos> Make sure I don't miss anything?<eos> I will.<eos> And you won't.
Well, she said she'd be here.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> We don't need her, but I pr...<eos> No, she's not answering her cell.<eos> We're in position.<eos> All right.<eos> Go when ready.<eos> Copy.<eos> Hope the wind doesn't change!<eos> It won't for hours.
Because you need it.<eos> But why do you do it?<eos> Because, over time, it's become clear to me that you are our equals.<eos> Why do YOU do it?<eos> My husband thinks I'm a do-gooder who should just worry about her own family.<eos> I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
Got it. Got the frequency.<eos> Right. Hester has to be inside the phone's Wi-Fi range.<eos> Get within 50 metres of her then hit that button and it will broadcast the activation frequency.<eos> - It should be instant, if it works. - All right.<eos> - I'm going alone.<eos> - No.<eos> Lord, though I want,<eos> I've already put you in danger. I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
We can't win... not without stronger evidence than the testimony of a school shooter - and a junkie drunk.<eos> - _ I really don't have time for this right now.<eos> Look, Freddy has his struggles.<eos> He's a victim.<eos> He helps the case.<eos> Substance abuse, theft.<eos> Jones's lawyers would tear him apart.<eos> Do you have any idea how many children Jones could have hurt over the past two decades?<eos> No! Because none of them will go on the record.<eos> Freddy will!
Congrats, boss.<eos> I like the sound of it.<eos> Don't get used to it.<eos> Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do. Not if I don't say so.<eos> You will. Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine. Plenty of other outlets will.
None.<eos> We need to call the police.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What? She said that whatever he did, he did it to protect the family.<eos> That he was wrong, but that he did it for us.<eos> And she didn't want to turn him in.<eos> You're going to stand beside a killer?<eos> Well, then I'll go to the police myself.<eos> No, you won't!
Charlotte.<eos> She said she was on a mission.<eos> She was taken as a host anyway.<eos> Why would the director want you dead?<eos> The director didn't send her.<eos> I've already told you, there's a faction in the future...<eos> No one but the director has the capability to send travelers.<eos> Tell them what you did.<eos> Tell them!<eos> Or I will.
Why shouldn't I finish the job?<eos> Because that's not what April would do.<eos> Majesty, please.<eos> If you would only let me...<eos> You have no idea what I would do.<eos> You have no idea what I'm capable of!<eos> I know exactly what you're capable of.<eos> But you are April because you choose not to do it.<eos> You told me you wouldn't let him break you.<eos> And I won't.
I want to use the Cabinet.<eos> Look at you, in your little circle... ..pretending to be heroes and never expecting to pay a price.<eos> We've paid plenty.<eos> And you will keep paying till you are just yourselves.<eos> I have killed two.<eos> Come with me or I will kill more.<eos> Who else did you kill?<eos> Can we use it?<eos> No, it has to be Charles.<eos> And he won't.
I can't.<eos> Let me look into your eyes.<eos> Let me know that I was brave.<eos> April. April, no.<eos> Not for my sake.<eos> It has to be this way!<eos> Or there'll be more dads... ..and more mums.<eos> Tell Ram...<eos> Tell him.<eos> I will.
It's the command of the king.<eos> He's lying!<eos> - He's going to kill everyone. - Quiet...<eos> That's his plan no matter what we do.<eos> They're only there because the king commands it. - I said quiet.<eos> - The king, Charlie.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Please don't make me. - What?<eos> Don't make you do what?<eos> No, you'll not. No.
I believe that far from being the weak link in the chain, human ingenuity, and the human psyche is gonna be the strongest link in the chain.<eos> There's a segment of people in this world that live on the edge.<eos> The talent of these people is evaluating the risk and always the rewards.<eos> If you figure that the reward is worth the risk.<eos> That yeah, it's risky, I know I could get killed doing this, but it's doing something that man had not done before.<eos> So is it worth it?<eos> Mhm, it's worth it.<eos> Mission control confirmed the rover is 2000 kilos over maximum payload with all of us aboard.<eos> I ran the numbers, the odds are we won't make it.<eos> Yeah, but someone will.
Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?<eos> No, Rachel, I don't.<eos> Because whether Leonard believes me or not, I really do have a firm to run.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Then you know I have ten other things to do before I get out of here tonight.<eos> Then I will leave it alone. But for what it's worth, you were there for me when the victim's father lashed out at me.<eos> And so, if you want to talk about it with someone, I just want you to know that I'm here for you, too.<eos> I appreciate that, Rachel.<eos> But right now, I'd rather you spend your time finding something to get Leonard Bailey out.<eos> I will.
Divorce has had a pretty magical effect on you, huh?<eos> You're just making big decisions all over the place now.<eos> Full of fuck-you's for the world.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> And Berkeley High is less than a mile that way.<eos> Uh, that way.<eos> Hey, how bad did Neil fuck up the house?<eos> It's not your problem, sweetie.<eos> It is if it falls down.<eos> It won't.
- No.<eos> And even if I wasn't dating Renee, the idea of my dad dating a girl of my age is so wrong.<eos> It'd be like us together.<eos> You wouldn't be the first of Ben's friends, I can assure you.<eos> Don't tell Ben.<eos> But you know what?<eos> That's it.<eos> If my dad could see how ridiculous he'd look with someone my age, he'd come to his senses and end this silliness with Renee on his own.<eos> Mrs. Wheeler, you've got to help me.<eos> Of course I will, Tucker.
We won't. I swear it.<eos> No, sir. You won't say a peep.<eos> Not a peep.<eos> I ain't forgot you led the police here and took away our babies.<eos> My babies.<eos> My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
No shame in that. Will the Rance girl be at this community picnic?<eos> I want to see her before she knows who I am.<eos> Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - You've already tried five different versions in mock court.<eos> I know, but none of them are right.<eos> None of them got us the win.<eos> They just haven't figured out that gender plays into Taylor's case.<eos> Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
I love you. Bye.<eos> Mommy, what are these?<eos> Oh, those are just headache pills, sweetie.<eos> I guess Leo gets a lot of headaches.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> So, you'll tape today to air tonight.<eos> This interview is a get.<eos> Every network wanted it, but we hope Elizabeth Vargas is a friend of the court.<eos> What if she brings up the blackout?<eos> She won't, sir.
Did you know?<eos> Mother.<eos> I have a favor to ask. You have to promise me.<eos> I've always wanted to wash your feet for you.<eos> Can't you just say this time that you're unable to go?<eos> I'll come back as soon as I finish my studies.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> you must come back.<eos> you must come back.<eos> I will.
I have to go to Berlin.<eos> Now?<eos> No.<eos> It's just for a couple of days.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> What did I say?<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Trust is not going to fix this, John.<eos> Nothing will.
Nine victims, Bennett.<eos> Heart, eyes, genitals, hands and feet are materials needed to perform vicari pulvari.<eos> Has the church been compromised?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You have some friends in this town.<eos> They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Father, please meet Juliet Shakesman.<eos> Miss Shakesman, how do you do?<eos> It's a great pleasure to meet you.<eos> So all I got to do is save the vice president of the United States.<eos> Sure, no probs. Relax.<eos> This Atzerodt guy shows his face, just point him out to the vice president's bodyguards.<eos> They'll do the rest.<eos> The gun's just in case.<eos> What if I freeze?<eos> You won't.
- Oh, God. ‭<eos> - What? Luke, you need to tell the CIA about this.<eos> - They said they've got it under control. - ‭Yes.<eos> But do they know this? Do they know it's not just D.C. It's in 80 towns in every state?<eos> Laurel, you're leaving.<eos> Just leave it to them.<eos> Luke, tell them. This could be about America, not just D.C.<eos> Okay. Got it.<eos> Luke, tell them.<eos> I will.
I'm glad.<eos> I want you to know that your baby is safe.<eos> This link is open day or night any time you want to see Agnes.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What do you mean, you don't want to trace the link?<eos> You don't think he's thought of that?<eos> The second he discovers we traced it, he'll take it away, take her away.<eos> Liz, the only way we're gonna get her is by finding where that link is coming from.<eos> I don't think he'll hurt her.<eos> Of course he will.
Your silence for a little blood?<eos> They served their purpose and you got rid of them.<eos> You're a smart woman, Dr. Gray, I'll give you that. But I don't think you really thought this through.<eos> Oh, I've thought about it, trust me.<eos> Here's the thing. Your crimes, your crimes consist of killing some pretty bad men.<eos> Serial murderers.<eos> But killing cops. Not gonna look too kindly on that.<eos> Are you saying that I shouldn't kill you two?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Okay, then I won't.
Give him the booster shot of the original vaccine.<eos> He's been pumped full of so many different vaccines.<eos> I'll do it myself!<eos> I need you to help me save my daughter.<eos> Whatever it is in your blood that makes you go and never stop, I need that now.<eos> Help me, Warren.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Addy!<eos> No one's coming for you, Lucy.<eos> Addy will.
Oh, we'll narrow down possible targets in the area.<eos> No.<eos> Percy and Patton can do that.<eos> Have Sebastian see if he can figure out what those schematics and blueprints go to.<eos> Well, what does that leave me?<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I know, King, I messed up.<eos> You did more than that, Christopher.<eos> Bad enough you went M.I.A. in the middle of a case... and that can't ever happen again, understand?<eos> It won't, but...
Well, then, I won't show.<eos> I... I-I'll... I'll get the books delivered to him.<eos> That's not gonna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're a loose end.<eos> Look, here's the deal, Doc...<eos> You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
They'll still be free. They'll still be safe.<eos> Yeah, but they could be free and safe here.<eos> Governor Baylin is ready for them.<eos> Well, unfortunately, he's not in the majority.<eos> No, he was standing up for an American principle.<eos> Who are we without our principles?<eos> Alex, it was an impossible choice.<eos> I know, and you had to make it and you will again, a-and the choices will always be impossible.<eos> That's not gonna change.<eos> But y-you will, and I will, and... this will.
I will literally stab myself in the face.<eos> -I'm not stupid. -Okay.<eos> Why is this so fun for me?<eos> Oh, and there's pizza.<eos> That looks delicious.<eos> Take a bite. I'm good.<eos> Eat some food, find out what happens.<eos> Try the food.<eos> Can you hand me another napkin?<eos> Will I or won't I? Will I or won't I?
And there is nothing on God's earth more annoying than a tracker.<eos> But I've got a tracker. It doesn't bother me in the slightest.<eos> No, that's because you'll have a little special place on your hall table with a pencil outline.<eos> "I've got my keys and must remember to take my tracker."<eos> Because you're organised and I'm not.<eos> One for your tracker, for your keys, one for your little penknife.<eos> One for some change in case you need it.<eos> -Yeah, with 10ps and 2ps.<eos> -And a tiny screwdriver for mending your glasses.<eos> -He will. Oh, he will.
Honestly, I'd rather stay busy.<eos> Then get back to work.<eos> Details now emerging in this morning's suicide bombing in an Elmhurst, Illinois coffee shop.<eos> Authorities confirm 21 dead, including the bomber, Atif Al-Mutaya, a native-born American citizen of Lebanese decent.<eos> Local to the area.<eos> Here's a box of cords I have, maybe something in here will work.<eos> ...FBI found a handwritten note pledging loyalty to ISIS.<eos> Yeah, thanks but these aren't gonna, restore your Wi-Fi connectivity.<eos> ...or how the bomber was radicalized...<eos> Okay, what will?
-No, you haven't.<eos> I'm going to pass, Mom.<eos> I will do it so I can change things.<eos> Forget about the money.<eos> Imagine what they would do if they found out you're not Rafael.<eos> That you are here trying to pass the Process for the second time.<eos> You wouldn't do that to your own son.<eos> Not to a good son.<eos> I would never do that to my Rafael.<eos> But to you, I will.
If it was one of us, you would've found a barrister.<eos> - Not for something like this.<eos> - Oh, crap. You don't like her.<eos> You never have.<eos> You won't lift a finger to help her.<eos> After everything I've done for you and your brother, you have the gall to think I'd, what, actively sabotage her?<eos> Well, we need to find the best we can now.<eos> With a day to go? Who's gonna be available?<eos> - We have to try.<eos> - All right. I will.
Please, let me through. Let me through, through here. Let me through.<eos> Please, back off. Please, back off.<eos> Ms. MacNeil, is Casey's condition related to what happened - The property line is behind the gate.<eos> Is Casey's condition related to what happened to your daughter, Reagan?<eos> My daughter's name is Angela.<eos> There's nothing wrong with Casey except she isn't here. Now, please, leave us be.<eos> There seems to be something in common with your family.<eos> Scooped the Sun Times, did it?<eos> If they find out we've been hiding her...<eos> They won't.
All right, my client was corporate.<eos> His client was corporate.<eos> But he climbed into the mind of every single one of those jurors.<eos> They went to deliberate on a Friday night.<eos> I had 'em.<eos> But you lost.<eos> Well, Monday morning was a different story.<eos> What happened over the weekend?<eos> I couldn't say.<eos> And I won't.
Elliot, David, Winnie.<eos> They were my family, these people.<eos> That place... how was I gonna fix it?<eos> Couldn't raise their... their rent.<eos> Some of them couldn't pay me already.<eos> Sir, I-I'm not a priest.<eos> I know. I don't care.<eos> I just need someone to forgive me.<eos> I need them to know how sorry I am and to forgive me.<eos> Will you, please?

I don't care.<eos> I just need someone to forgive me.<eos> I need them to know how sorry I am and to forgive me.<eos> Will you, please?<eos> Will you?
That would be a firm no.<eos> Aren't you a ray of sunshine!<eos> I wonder if those colorful beverages have anything to do with it?<eos> You leave my beverages out of this!<eos> I'm just saying, maybe you'd be a little less snippy if you were more hydrated.<eos> Look, this is my Zen area.<eos> Whatever I do up here is my business!<eos> Not if your business is the Big Tobacco and Alcohol trade!<eos> My God, give it a rest!<eos> I will not.
- Okay.<eos> I'll see about getting you reinstated to the NYPD immediately.<eos> I think this deserves another hug. - Me too.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - One was sufficient.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Pimento, you son of a bitch!<eos> You're the son of a bitch!<eos> Oh, we'll see who's a son of a bitch.<eos> Oh, yes, we will.
- She's our favorite director. - Aw.<eos> I love "You've Got Mail."<eos> - That's Nora Ephron, you idiot.<eos> - I know.<eos> Wait, hold up.<eos> Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history.<eos> How are you gonna do it?<eos> I was kinda hoping you would.<eos> I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present!<eos> - Of course I will!
If only you didn't break the egg.<eos> I think we'll end up dying here.<eos> Just like Jae-wook.<eos> I will return.<eos> I can return.<eos> I don't think like Tae-sik.<eos> I'm going to make it!<eos> I can return.<eos> Su-rin, I'll go back.<eos> I will.
You know, just taking a little bit off the top, stealing from criminals.<eos> How is that even wrong?<eos> Then I got in deeper and deeper.<eos> I've spent years looking over my shoulder, waiting for this thing to come home.<eos> Now, it's over.<eos> So, in a way, you... You did me a favor.<eos> So now, I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> So what, you're gonna talk to the police?<eos> No. No.<eos> I won't.
To the north, there is a black rock that touches the sky.<eos> I would meet with their leader.<eos> To challenge him?<eos> I saw you, lead the smallteeths to our encampment.<eos> They have seen what is being built.<eos> And only you know, what Gul'dan has planned for my people.<eos> His magic is death to all things.<eos> He must be stopped.<eos> Tell him, the black rock, when the sun is highest.<eos> I will.
Every woman in my life has kids.<eos> Every one of them.<eos> Before I even got to them.<eos> Man.<eos> You're obviously very attractive to mothers, Hank.<eos> Jesus, Bobbie.<eos> You're pregnant.<eos> We could get married.<eos> Baby, you don't want to marry me.<eos> I will.
We're gonna get the best treatment and I'm gonna take off work and help you and my mom can come stay with us.<eos> - Right, but I think that...<eos> - It'll be okay.<eos> We need...<eos> I can't pull up, Christ!<eos> Did the doctor tell you about the su*ival rate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but, you know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this.<eos> We will.
That idiot almost pecked my eye out.<eos> Cut!<eos> Good.<eos> Yes, Martin?<eos> -It's bad.<eos> - No, it is not bad.<eos> - It looks stupid.<eos> - No, it's good.<eos> People in the cinema won't be watching though binoculars!<eos> Or maybe they will...
I remember her.<eos> I remember all of it.<eos> She's not gone.<eos> She's still here?<eos> It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.<eos> What is essential is invisible to the eye.<eos> He'll always be with me.<eos> I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!
May I remind you they're under Turkish administration.<eos> Are you going to ask for their permit?<eos> No, and I'm not going to ask for your permit either.<eos> Do not forget one thing. Do not forget that soon, we intend to inherit their empire<eos> I do not want trouble for our ongoing efforts. You will not stir up confrontation with Turkey because of the Bedouins.<eos> They are feuding among themselves.<eos> Now this little venture of yours is counterproductive and dangerous.<eos> You have no power to stop me.<eos> You will not leave.<eos> Yes, I will.
You know what? Tonight, I'm actually the only person who's not partying.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Kale! Kate! Kate!<eos> Hey. Lollapazuzu, I'm partying now.<eos> You ready for me?<eos> I've been ready.<eos> My safe word is "Keep going."<eos> I don't need one.<eos> You will.
Come on, my love.<eos> Happy Birthday!<eos> When the girls were little, I used to wash their hair with this sprayer.<eos> I could put this one in the condo, if you like.<eos> No.<eos> I'll remember it.<eos> Scratch my back?<eos> There'? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Listen, Dad... I'll buy the house as is and Kate and Haley can stay here.<eos> No, you won't.
- Oh. It's the height of vanity, you know?<eos> You can't imagine her embarrassment when she discovered that she lived.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, no one should be ashamed. No.<eos> No.<eos> I tell her to call me if she feels it coming over her again.<eos> Now, every time the phone rings I resent her a little more - and I think that...<eos> Mind your feet.<eos> - You can't live forever.<eos> - Exactly. None of us can.<eos> Oh, Marianne will.
- Dad!<eos> - Watch out!<eos> - Give me the pipe!<eos> - Wedge it under the handle!<eos> Watch out, Mom!<eos> Watch out, Claire!<eos> Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!<eos> He's not getting in.<eos> It'll hold.<eos> It will.
What is that?<eos> This is extremely valuable, all right?<eos> This is a valve ring.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> This is the valve ring to the first trumpet my dad gave me.<eos> You can put it on a chain, you know.<eos> Huh? That way...<eos> You won't lose it.<eos> You're not gonna lose it, are you?<eos> No, I won't.
We needed to speak to you.<eos> Me?<eos> Regarding what?<eos> Kamal left his book behind.<eos> Go. Take it.<eos> Go on.<eos> May I have some water?<eos> Go on.<eos> Tell her about them.<eos> I will.
Why would I be scared?<eos> I should have been scared instead.<eos> You know who that nurse was?<eos> - Who?<eos> Neelu.<eos> Remember I told you about Neelu?<eos> That was her.<eos> Have some.<eos> What if she tells your father?<eos> She won't.
- Yes<eos> You do not have that amount.<eos> Yes I have it.<eos> Do not go do that.<eos> Next move:<eos> Incomplete pass.<eos> I say that grabs.<eos> You gotta be kidding<eos> We're leaving.<eos> We will.
You do not have that amount.<eos> Yes I have it.<eos> Do not go do that.<eos> Next move:<eos> Incomplete pass.<eos> I say that grabs.<eos> You gotta be kidding<eos> We're leaving.<eos> We will.<eos> We will.
There'll be oodles of money there.<eos> Oodles, I say.<eos> -I don't know. That sounds risky.<eos> -What's risky?<eos> He's suggesting we... knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.<eos> - It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> - We all will.
- What did you shoot her up with?<eos> Well, she's tired.<eos> It's a very hot day.<eos> I have what you want.<eos> - He can see us.<eos> - Bring it here, the girl walks.<eos> No, send her out now, alone, and then I'll give you what you want.<eos> We have a seat here for you, Jim.<eos> We're not gonna do anything in public.<eos> I will.
Tell me how to build an Agent.<eos> You don't want an Agent.<eos> Then, What do I want?<eos> An Army.<eos> And I won't give it to you.<eos> Then you're going to die.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Yes, what about your daughter?<eos> You don't have her.<eos> No, but I will... eventually.
Sweet dreams.<eos> - Hi, Milo.<eos> - Hi, Dylan.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have something to show you.<eos> I'm supposed to be asleep.<eos> Your mom just started working.<eos> She'll be out there for hours.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
That's really embarrassing.<eos> And text is usually my forte, so...<eos> - Well, it looks great.<eos> - Well, thank you, that's really sweet...<eos> When my hands aren't covered in... in glitter paint, you think maybe we can try that again?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - All right, okay.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll look forward to that.<eos> - You know, let me know when you're clean. - I... that's...<eos> I will.
Six'? !<eos> - I didn't study that yet.<eos> Get your notebook and pencil, and do your math!<eos> I can't see a thing.<eos> Is your bag heavy'?<eos> - No...<eos> Good...<eos> This cement sure is!<eos> Tell Voja lo slop by for a chat.<eos> - I will.
- No...<eos> Good...<eos> This cement sure is!<eos> Tell Voja lo slop by for a chat.<eos> - I will.<eos> I'd oorne over to your place, but I have to wail for the bell.<eos> When will it arrive'?<eos> -Any day now.<eos> Tell your grandpa lo hold on!<eos> -I will.
We'll crack this case.<eos> The bastards won't get away with it.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> We're relying on you, Sgt. Po.<eos> Of course, it's my duty.<eos> But Master Ip you know the score.<eos> The police can't keep watch here all day.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Tell people to be careful.<eos> - I will.
You killed Will and your parents.<eos> You're deadly.<eos> Enough!<eos> No one's gonna love you Tris.<eos> They're never even gonna miss you.<eos> This world will only be better off without you.<eos> One less Divergent ruining everything.<eos> And no one ... will ever ... ever forgive you for what you've done.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Because I will.
Always room in the ranks for a gentleman of your caliber.<eos> It's a roof over your head.<eos> Food.<eos> Who wants a fine wage?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You might try Weatherbury.<eos> If you're looking for work, there's a farm there needs all the help it can get.<eos> Yes.<eos> The young lad there.<eos> I will.
She has promised?<eos> An implied promise.<eos> Once again, I'm...<eos> Will she do what's right?<eos> If it's not inconvenient to her.<eos> Oak, you've become quite cynical lately.<eos> She never promised that first time.<eos> Therefore, she has never broken her promise.<eos> She hasn't promised this time, either.<eos> But she will.
- No, I mean it.<eos> - How are we getting on?<eos> - We are nailing it.<eos> - That's great.<eos> You can put about half those lagers back, Adam.<eos> What does Nancy want to drink?<eos> - I'm not sure if...<eos> - She wants vodka.<eos> The only spirit she can out-drink me on. We'll see about that later.<eos> No, we won't.
I'll cover you! Move around them!<eos> Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!<eos> There we go.<eos> Wait! Help me with the cripple!<eos> Better take five paces backward on your mark, laddie.<eos> A crippled home for crippled man.<eos> Thank you, Yuri.<eos> My quarters are actually up there.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> We will.
Hello, bound lady.<eos> Not now, Aldo.<eos> I think Mr. Fine underestimated you.<eos> You found your target, you tracked them down.<eos> You fought very hard.<eos> Susan.<eos> You're a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Maybe we'll not.
- Really?<eos> - Yes, really!<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Well, just wanted to welcome you back to town.<eos> I'll get the bags.<eos> Hey, Phoebe, do you want an omelet?<eos> This could be the right moment.<eos> Hey, Mikey?<eos> Is this okay? I think this...<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> - Phoebe, no, I'm sorry. Did you burn your hand?<eos> Just let me do the cooking, okay?<eos> - I will. Sorry.
I said I would follow your orders.<eos> There's a difference between understanding something in yer mind and really knowing it, deep down.<eos> I can tell ye from my own experience that a good hiding makes ye understand things in a more serious light.<eos> But as I said, if it was just me ye put in danger...<eos> Such a thing is justice, Claire.<eos> Ye've done wrong to all the men, and ye must suffer for it.<eos> I'm yer husband.<eos> It's my duty to attend to it.<eos> I will not let you beat me!<eos> Ye won't?
- Of course.<eos> Really? it's that easy?<eos> You're not going to bet?<eos> Come on, Julián, I'm not in the water now.<eos> Here, in your medium, you can tell me the truth.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> We have to do the Cesarian now.<eos> You girl's fine. And she won't need an incubator.<eos> Will I see her?<eos> I will?
Okay, first I pass the heavy rope, then the walk cable.<eos> We got the rope.<eos> Okay, we're sending the cable.<eos> Hold it. Hold it! Hold it!<eos> We have a problem.<eos> We will do everything we can to pull up the cable.<eos> It's only a few hours before daylight.<eos> We will do everything we can.<eos> Philippe, this is crazy. We're never going to finish at this rate.<eos> Yes, we will.
- ... I'd take part in the contest<eos> - Naina, keep quiet<eos> That's enough from them<eos> Take part in the wife-carrying contest<eos> I will not.<eos> Let my father carry you<eos> You will carry your wife and run<eos> It's your birthday, but don't talk rot<eos> I have told him. He'll run<eos> - I won't
They are 10,000 miles from home in a godforsaken corner of a godforsaken country across a godforsaken ocean.<eos> They barely eat.<eos> They barely drink.<eos> Take away their women, sir, and they will rebel.<eos> This is not England, Captain Collins.<eos> This is a godforsaken corner of a godforsaken country across a godforsaken ocean.<eos> I will not do it, sir.<eos> Do what?<eos> You are about to ask me to annul Tommy Barrett's marriage and Elizabeth Quinn's and...<eos> I will not, sir.
We agreed not to.<eos> I don't care what we agreed.<eos> Make love to me.<eos> And if you get pregnant?<eos> I want to get pregnant.<eos> And go through all that again?<eos> ! No, we will never again see you in such pain.<eos> It will not die.<eos> ~ They have all died.<eos> ~ This one will not.
A little welcome-back challenge.<eos> Groups of five.<eos> Pasha.<eos> What the fuck am I listening to?<eos> Whose phone is that?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Ah, the hard-luck story.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Toni's piece... is so physical.<eos> The impact, the stress --<eos> Odette/Odile, Kitri, - I'm quite familiar with your resume.<eos> - Raymonda, Sleeping Beauty...<eos> But, darling, I would be lying if I said there wasn't some concern.<eos> What is this concern?<eos> Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t-to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
You know that, right?<eos> This is the most momentous moment for you... for us.<eos> But don't let expectations weigh on you.<eos> Just... do what you do, my darling.<eos> Do what you do.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes?<eos> Good?<eos> Good.<eos> We'll...
- Charlotte.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're crowding me.<eos> I understand this is very important to you, but I can't work like this.<eos> You have regular custom with the men of Captain Flint's crew, yes?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Just one. He won't let the others near me.<eos> Has he paid you a visit yet since his recent arrival?<eos> No, but he will.
- We got him. - Just relaying my condition is still good.<eos> - I'm getting ready for impact. - We got him.<eos> Mission control is in communication with astronaut Shepard, and he is okay.<eos> We are hearing that everything is a-okay.<eos> You promised the press a comment.<eos> Louise?<eos> Louise?<eos> Alan can never know I was scared.<eos> No one can.<eos> They won't.
We all do.<eos> You all know what?<eos> That you always do that.<eos> They warn us.<eos> - Was it in your mission briefing?<eos> - Under potential hazards.<eos> - Along with mines and drunken soldiers?<eos> - Right above it.<eos> You should read them.<eos> I will now.
There's that octopus in Berlin.<eos> Cobra, I asked you a question!<eos> - What? -What did you take?<eos> Speed?<eos> That doesn't look like speed.<eos> What the fuck did you take? !<eos> - A diamond and an octopus, man!<eos> -You arsehole, I'm gonna...<eos> - I won't do it again.<eos> I won't.
What the fuck did you take? !<eos> - A diamond and an octopus, man!<eos> -You arsehole, I'm gonna...<eos> - I won't do it again.<eos> I won't.<eos> -Shut up!<eos> Tentaclesl<eos> Good morning.<eos> Get a move on.<eos> - I won't!
There are others that will do that.<eos> You've earned your rest.<eos> I did not rest when I was young and I was ridden all the stronger by it.<eos> The young will not be tempered as we were.<eos> They have an electric carpet sweeper in the Mother House.<eos> I fear what we will find in the girl who comes to join us.<eos> Sister, I think perhaps you are confusing the new midwife with Nurse Miller.<eos> She has gone to Chichester as a postulant.<eos> But you said she would come back.<eos> And she will.
Oh, my God, it's gonna be huge.<eos> The gays and the housewives are going to love this.<eos> Bring in the Jews, and we'll have a three quadrant book.<eos> There is going to be an auction among all of the major publishing houses.<eos> Ellen has spoken to her agent, and he's going to let Empirical make the first bid.<eos> That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
Yes, I love you.<eos> What will King Ecbert do to me?<eos> He will do nothing to you, so long as I protect you and Ragnar protects me.<eos> Ecbert must hide his power behind a legitimate heir to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Then he will not have me killed.<eos> No, he will not have you killed.<eos> Burgred, you and I will be joint rulers to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Does that not excite you, hmm?<eos> The Mercians may quarrel against us.<eos> No, they will not.
Come on, Jason. Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You tell him.<eos> Clear out that area. Ethan.<eos> We've got this under control.<eos> Under control?<eos> They breached the perimeter.<eos> We're fortunate to still be alive.<eos> You have to stop this now.<eos> I will.
Tampa.<eos> That she lives in Tampa, right.<eos> Look, Jules.<eos> There's a good chance you're right about Trav and Laurie, but there's also a chance that they step up and surprise all of us.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Where you ready to be a mom when you got pregnant?<eos> I took my pregnancy test in the bathroom at Wrestlemania.<eos> Right, but now you've moved on from your completely insane life, and, well, you've become the best mom I know.<eos> So whatever we have to do to make this work, I promise you...<eos> we will, Jules.
I'm thinking of a pure community this time.<eos> Yes, no outsiders, just family.<eos> I don't understand!<eos> - After the first purge, your sister Annabelle bore me 17 children.<eos> Alice gave me 22 after the second one.<eos> Oh, my dear, your life is about to be filled with glorious purpose.<eos> My sweet girl, You're going to be the mother to a whole new generation.<eos> No...<eos> I won't do it!<eos> Oh, of course you will.
What the hell is this place?<eos> This is where Michael bestowed his greatest gift upon the world.<eos> The gift of life.<eos> What have you done to them, their throats, their voices?<eos> Only in silence could they find peace.<eos> Where are the life support units?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Release them.<eos> - All of them.<eos> - I will not.
Why is it so fucking difficult for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Now!<eos> You're under arrest, you son of a bitch.<eos> Let him go!<eos> Let him go!<eos> - Put the gun down.<eos> - You put yours down.<eos> I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> I will.
Who are you?<eos> You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
That's a real cubic zarcarbion.<eos> Holy shit, dude!<eos> Man, it sparkles like a motherfucker.<eos> Man, dude, and it follows you where you look.<eos> I'm so happy for you, man!<eos> It's awesome!<eos> It does, eh. I'm so nervous, though.<eos> It's all I can think about.<eos> I really don't want to fuck this up.<eos> You won't, man.
Took me weeks.<eos> I had to charm Holiday with my mad poker skills.<eos> Let us take care of it.<eos> How do we find him?<eos> He's a silent partner at an upscale sports bar in Dallas called Donovan's.<eos> I just had a contentious phone call with U.S. Attorney Sandoval.<eos> Her office was alerted by TSA about your brother's flight.<eos> She asked that we hand him over.<eos> Whoa. I mean, you said that I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> Well, you won't -- just yet.
Yes.<eos> Did I love him?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Must I love him now?<eos> That's for you to say.<eos> There's so much that frightens me.<eos> I don't know how to feel or act.<eos> In the smallest ways even. How to sit and speak.<eos> Don't let me be hurt.<eos> I won't.
and the shovels and the cleavers as we did before, like we learned from our fathers, and we fight for what is ours!<eos> Aye! Drink up, lads! Drink up!<eos> Now go.<eos> Burn the witch!<eos> Burn the witch! Burn the witch!<eos> When do you go?<eos> After.<eos> I won't pretend I'm not sorry.<eos> - I can come back.<eos> - You won't.
Ans yet I am, ans live - Like vapours tosses<eos> I long for scenes Where man hath never tros<eos> A place where woman Never smiled or wept<eos> There to abise with my Creator, Gos<eos> Ans sleep as I in chilshoos Sweetly slept<eos> Untroubling ans untroubles Where I lie<eos> - The grass below - The grass below - Above the vaultes sky<eos> I wonder if he ever found it, his silent place with God.<eos> The poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
Then 89 to the Grand Canyon.<eos> I feel like I'm sitting right next to you.<eos> Is it cold yet?<eos> A little.<eos> I wouldn't rush home.<eos> Well, I want to get your brothers before they go to sleep.<eos> I'll call you next week.<eos> I really want you to sell that equipment.<eos> You have no idea about money.<eos> I will.
I need to talk to you!<eos> There's been a mistake!<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'm Claire Fraser from... from Castle Leoch.<eos> I'm married to James Fraser, nephew of the Laird.<eos> And I'm King Arthur.<eos> Surely King Arthur was more appealing than that slimy puddock.<eos> We won't be here long.<eos> Dougal will come for us.<eos> No, he won't.
It's all right, baby.<eos> Mama's here now, and everything's gonna be all right, hmm?<eos> Nate's phone shows he talked to Rebecca the day Sam died.<eos> The police want her to come in as soon as possible.<eos> It's fine. Annalise can prep her.<eos> Frank says she hasn't left her room since Nate was arrested.<eos> Aww. You know, we should all go give her a hug and thank her for saving our butts.<eos> How can you celebrate the fact that an innocent man might go to jail for us?<eos> I'll go talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
Then there's the food. The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?<eos> We're gonna need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?<eos> Don't they?<eos> Don't who?<eos> People eat pigeon pie in the capital.<eos> They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.<eos> It's a fine place, isn't it?<eos> A fine place.<eos> I never thought I'd be settling down in a place like this.<eos> You won't.
She saved your life, too, right?<eos> It was hers.<eos> We're not dead.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> You're not dead.<eos> I know you.<eos> We're different. I can't let myself--<eos> But you... I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
Yeah, by the book.<eos> We got the weapon?<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But, uh, my officers made some real connections with those kids at the baseball game today, and there is something there.<eos> And I'll make it stick.<eos> You know, if I left my game today to see Boz Shepherd go down, I can live with that.<eos> But if we let him slip again...<eos> We won't.

Coach Hope.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> - I heard about Maggie.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Listen, I have a few things I need to attend to tomorrow morning.<eos> Can I count on you to make me Bisquick?<eos> Or will you write me a letter from my dead coach saying it'll happen, and then it'll all be a lie?<eos> I should have never betrayed your trust.<eos> - And I never will again.
You're still only a junior resident here.<eos> I suggest you start behaving like one.<eos> I'm not answerable to you, Matron.<eos> In fact, it's the other way around.<eos> Right. Bear with us, Mrs O'Reilly.<eos> We'll have that baby of yours out safely before the year's over.<eos> Do you think this means he's out of intensive care for good?<eos> If he keeps improving like this, he might be home in a few weeks.<eos> I'm so frightened I'm going to hurt him.<eos> You won't.
This is what we thought we were fighting against.<eos> No.<eos> I have something that will make you better.<eos> I have the real cure.<eos> Granderson thinks this is insignificant.<eos> It's not insignificant.<eos> You have to believe me -- I-I didn't know what she was doing at Olympia.<eos> Aside from Hamada, most of the doctors and staff -- We thought we were helping.<eos> You'll have time to redeem yourself when the others come for me.<eos> And they will.
No, on the contrary. The regime would be most unhappy if they knew I was here.<eos> - But the reference code you gave...<eos> - Was a little old.<eos> You should be more careful, Mr Hauser.<eos> You've become complacent.<eos> Ms Lao, I'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> You are going to give me the contents of this safety deposit box.<eos> - I will do no such thing.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
Did you kill my son?<eos> - Put the gun away, and then we'll talk.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't get to tell me what to do.<eos> - You answer the question.<eos> - You stand still!<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> The car, the bomb - it was you, wasn't it?<eos> I swear to God, if you don't tell me... I - I want to.<eos> And I will.
You keep trying to impress me, but I don't impress as easily as you or your kind.<eos> Perhaps this will impress you.<eos> I hope you're enjoying your last day as a detective.<eos> I'm starting to.<eos> That new apartment of yours, you paid in cash, right?<eos> A lot of money for a man on a salary.<eos> Not for one who works hard and saves judiciously.<eos> If you have any further questions, you can refer them to my attorney.<eos> You have one?<eos> I will soon.
You left me no choice.<eos> Don't you dare try and lay this at my feet.<eos> You took what you wanted.<eos> And now I'm legally in control of the family and all our holdings.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> What will you do?<eos> Go to the police.<eos> Tell the newspapers.<eos> Tell Mother.<eos> No, you won't.
It's 2:00 in the morning.<eos> I'm gonna finish this album.<eos> If I have to go line by line and note by note, I'm gonna do it.<eos> Juliette, come here, come here.<eos> You know that's not gonna sound right, okay?<eos> It takes all the emotion out of everything.<eos> What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't. I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.
[Scoffs] You think having cancer embarrasses me?<eos> Isn't that why you keep it a secret?<eos> I don't know, I guess, I just... You know, don't want people to look at me funny or... or... feelin' sorry for me or... not makin' direct eye contact.<eos> I guess there's no reason to hide something you shouldn't be ashamed of anyway, huh?<eos> I'm really sorry for the sneaking around and the lying.<eos> Thank you. Maybe there's somebody else you should apologize to?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ my heart ♪<eos> ♪ keeps on breaking but ♪<eos> ♪ I won't ♪
- easy to get rid of.<eos> - Will you please just talk to me?<eos> Please? - [Sighs deeply] - Listen, there's a lot goin' on.<eos> There's a lot goin' on that you don't know about.<eos> No, trust me, I'm sure I know plenty.<eos> Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
I'm sorry.<eos> You are half of the band and if... if you wanna keep taking meetings, I'm fine with that.<eos> No, you're right about Highway 65.<eos> We're not gonna get a better deal than that.<eos> Does that mean you... you do wanna sign?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I already signed there once.<eos> Rayna believe in me, she invested money in me, and I... blew it up.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to her again.<eos> I won't.
Yeah?<eos> Why don't we call your dad, the Seattle fire chief, and ask him what a dead canary in a locker means?<eos> He'll tell us it's a threat... dead canaries don't sing.<eos> I'm you, a probie, a new guy, carrying on the family name.<eos> I get put with the D'Agostinos.<eos> I find out they're pyro-pirates, I want out.<eos> But they warn me to shut up.<eos> I'm hoping it'll all just go away.<eos> You know what, Larry?<eos> It won't.
~ Very probably.<eos> Well, at least... say we part friends.<eos> Well, if I did, it would be a lie.<eos> ~ Oh, I don't know. Muddle through, I suppose.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> Please leave my house.<eos> And shut the door on your way out.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
I know my daughter. You're not my daughter.<eos> Why don't you love me?<eos> Does your heart not work?<eos> ♪ What did you do?<eos> ♪ It was you who killed all those people.<eos> They had to go to sleep.<eos> It's no use.<eos> I can't do anything. Mark it's okay.<eos> Someday, they'll wake-up and be better.<eos> No they won't Iris.
Then you wouldn't mind answering a few questions.<eos> Just think dry thoughts.<eos> Sand dunes.<eos> Camels.<eos> Ironically, there is a bathroom less than ten feet away from us.<eos> Not helping.<eos> Scorched earth.<eos> Burnt toast.<eos> Would you please just go out there?<eos> No, I will not.
I can't, Daddy.<eos> Yes, you can. I know the attorney told you not to talk to anyone, but we're telling you something different now.<eos> These officers need your help.<eos> Your mommy and I want you to help them.<eos> Katori, come on.<eos> Who gave those drugs to you?<eos> Who are you protecting right now? You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
Nobody makes a move until I say so.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Vehicle's approaching.<eos> Everyone stay alert.<eos> Stay alert.<eos> I'm gonna get a water.<eos> I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.

Angelica didn't believe in fault.<eos> She said it was the present understood by people looking backward.<eos> We have to look forward.<eos> If we don't, we won't survive.<eos> And now that you know the truth...<eos> it's time for me to go.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you came back.<eos> And if they find you, you're going to lead them straight to me.<eos> No, I won't.
But Dutch has to be in on it. She's family, too.<eos> OK.<eos> Meaning, don't plow our sister.<eos> Remind me was that on the Jaqobis family crest?<eos> I've seen how you look at her.<eos> D'av, this is almost working.<eos> We are a good team.<eos> We could be great.<eos> So don't mess that up for us.<eos> I won't.
I know you can be a devious son of a bitch when you want to be.<eos> I'd do the same for you.<eos> Oh shit! Shit!<eos> I'll get help!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> This officer needs help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Let go.<eos> Don't make me shoot you.<eos> You won't.
- Your wife's designs.<eos> - And the Selfridge Estate.<eos> - They're really quite similar.<eos> - It's a good start.<eos> I'm off home now, Mr. Selfridge.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you, Miss Plunkett.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> You have tickets for the theater.<eos> - I won't.
According to this, Jake Simmons was a guest of the Opal City police department on December 11th, 2013.<eos> What do I know that date from?<eos> That was the date of the particle accelerator test.<eos> But if Simmons wasn't in Central City the night of the dark matter explosion, then... How can he be a meta-human?<eos> Do you know who I am, child?<eos> You're the Demon.<eos> I am the Demon's Head.<eos> As those were before me, and very soon, your brother.<eos> He will never take your place.<eos> He will.
That makes me happy.<eos> Hmm.<eos> If a man die, shall he live again? Right.<eos> That's all you got to do now-- read the Bible.<eos> It's a good book. You should, too.<eos> You know you was conceived in the back of a truck between a church and a graveyard?<eos> I'd tell you to go kill yourself, but I know you don't have the balls.<eos> If you're here, then you're desperate, so come back with some money.<eos> Oh, yes you are.<eos> Maybe not on purpose, but you will.
She's maddening!<eos> True, but-but she's my best friend, and she is not going... anywhere, all right?<eos> Lavon seems to be serious about her, and for all know, that may well have been the first breakfast of the rest of our lives.<eos> We cannot sully the sanctity of breakfast.<eos> Lavon loves breakfast, and you love Lavon, and Lemon isn't that bad.<eos> So, we'll figure out a way to get along?<eos> Well, you have no choice.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I will.
Look into this. It's a common nail.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> I didn't say it was gonna be easy.<eos> It's an avenue. Could lead to premeditation.<eos> We're walking it. "We" meaning you.<eos> I know it's not as much fun as dressing up for Halloween... - Oh, no, I want to.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll, uh, I'll work on it right away.<eos> Whatever "it" is better not get in the way - of filing that right away.<eos> - It won't.
- John, we cannot report this.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> If there's nothing in that shed, then we have nothing to worry about.<eos> If we move anything in that shed... we are felons.<eos> We are dealers at that point.<eos> I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No. We won't.
- I wouldn't say anything right now.<eos> I'll talk to Marco.<eos> Gonna go have a talk with your brother.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yeah, it just seems like a lot of fuss and bother about nothing, really.<eos> How the hell could you release him, Clay?<eos> I can't hold him on what I've got. You know that.<eos> Danny must've moved the drugs before you picked him up.<eos> - You gotta keep an eye on him.<eos> - We will.
I sat in their offices, and I begged those bastards.<eos> But no.<eos> She's not covered, they said.<eos> So I brought her home and I took care of her myself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
It's a tightening of the chest.<eos> I get tight in my chest, sometimes.<eos> Like the scream inside that can't come out.<eos> Oh, dear me!<eos> What's happened here?<eos> I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go! Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
Hold your tongue!<eos> Don't say anything, for once. Just listen.<eos> I've never known anyone to own a yard of land, Sal, not even your da.<eos> See, look - when you've got your own place, you can weather any storm, batten down till things get better, and no-one can take it away from you - no-one.<eos> Think of that - us on our own land, us!<eos> All we got to do is plant a crop and it's ours. Ours, Sal!<eos> Crop? Yeah.<eos> You don't know one end of a turnip from another,<eos> Will Thornhill. Nah. I won't do it - not out there in that terrible wildness.<eos> I won't.
I should have trusted you with more of this.<eos> I think with that harassment, I could have stepped up more.<eos> Helped you out. - It's all right.<eos> I was jealous.<eos> I'll say it. I should have stopped thinking of you that way or switched partners.<eos> No, I fucked up there.<eos> I think I might be unfair to people sometimes.<eos> Stay safe. And stay alive.<eos> Please be careful. Please get out of this.<eos> I will.
Murdoch?<eos> He's by the skid-d-der.<eos> Is he breathing?<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, we'll, uh...<eos> Drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
Hola.<eos> Hola.<eos> Anatoly may be the way in.<eos> He seems more amenable to the proposition, or at least not quite as... vitriolic as his brother.<eos> Well, confrontations can be expensive.<eos> I'd prefer to handle this quietly.<eos> How are we on the timeline?<eos> Within a reasonable margin.<eos> Assuming we can settle with the Russians quickly.<eos> We will.
He doesn't know that I'm sick.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> He's receiving his physician of the year award from the American Society of Cardiology, and there is a black-tie gala tomorrow night.<eos> While he'd never admit it, this award means the world to him.<eos> Vivian... you know him.<eos> If I tell him now, he'll...<eos> Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> I will. I will.
And no one's gonna blame you For stabbing a burglar in your own home.<eos> Well, i can't take that risk.<eos> That's why we're not calling the police.<eos> But you can help them catch this guy.<eos> I mean, he's -- he's still out there.<eos> He was wearing a mask.<eos> I couldn't identify him even if i wanted to.<eos> I don't get it, mrs. Stappord.<eos> Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?<eos> He won't.
You know the memorial's today.<eos> Of course.<eos> If you'd spoken to the lawyer, he might have been able to arrange a short furlough.<eos> I'd never be welcome there.<eos> Maybe you could write something.<eos> Something I could read later.<eos> Then at least you'd be a part of the memorial.<eos> Perhaps it might help you make amends.<eos> I need to speak to Joe.<eos> And you will.
You want to talk about picking up other girls in front of your girlfriend?<eos> W-what?<eos> No, man.<eos> I...<eos> He knows, Asher.<eos> You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students.<eos> But don't worry...<eos> I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
That change things?<eos> Yes, actually it does.<eos> Make it more illicit?<eos> Or would there be less chance of us... getting attached one night and done?<eos> Only that would happen anyway because once you saw the real me, you would run screaming like everyone else.<eos> I have to say, you're not who I imagined you'd be.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You can let yourself out.<eos> love, love love love, love love But you promised to dance with me.<eos> And I will.
They're out there fighting, dying right now to take back the ship.<eos> You're just gonna blow them to kingdom come?<eos> - Fury's orders are...<eos> - Well, Fury's dead!<eos> He's not seeing what we're seeing.<eos> He's right, Bobbi.<eos> We already took the top deck.<eos> Director Fury left orders, and we're gonna follow them.<eos> Hydra will not get this ship and its cargo.<eos> They won't.
I can't have a... a window?<eos> ! I don't even know what day it is anymore!<eos> You're lucky we've kept you alive.<eos> You found her, didn't you?<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You found her, and she's here.<eos> Uh, I forgive you.<eos> You must have had your reasons.<eos> Now take me to my Daisy.<eos> You will not!
And I realized her words have come true.<eos> I am not a monster.<eos> I am an angel.<eos> I'm finally what I'm meant to be.<eos> I'm happy to hear you say that.<eos> Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they're also heralds, sent to reveal the truth.<eos> And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No. They won't.
Thanks.<eos> You know, I really like you a lot.<eos> Probably my favorite guy that my mom's brought around.<eos> I'm your favorite? I guess...<eos> I'm your favorite loser of all those ones.<eos> Yeah. You're my favorite loser, that's...<eos> I'll take that.<eos> - I didn't wanna say it. - I'll take that.<eos> With Joel standing there.<eos> I'll...
And I love you.<eos> And... here.<eos> You'll recall, Powdered Sugar Donuts are Rose and Luisa's post-coital go-to snack.<eos> You think this makes up for you locking me up?<eos> No, no.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't make that up to you.<eos> But I can do other things.<eos> Look, I'm gonna tell your father the truth about us.<eos> I will.
I do keep cash in there, and I needed an international phone when I traveled to find Luisa.<eos> And I heard that Michael was snooping around, so I moved it.<eos> Look, the guy's got it in for me.<eos> He's trying to get in your head, and he clearly has, because you are standing in front of me thinking that I might be some kind of bad guy.<eos> That I might have something to do with this...<eos> Crazy Sin Rostro.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I'm sorry I even asked.<eos> Please don't let Michael get between us.<eos> No. I won't.
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> I think people need to hear your voice to hear his. Can we set up a time to meet?<eos> Um... I'll think about it. Thank you, Thomas.<eos> Seth, this is good, but downplay expectations even more.<eos> There's no telling what we'll walk away with.<eos> - Yes, sir. - We shouldn't inform the press until after you land, for security purposes.<eos> Donald...<eos> - If anything should happen to me--<eos> - I'm prepared.<eos> - But nothing will.
I will have your core.<eos> The only thing undecided is whether you will give it to me or if I must take it.<eos> We've created a world here.<eos> There are families now, children, a whole generation.<eos> And if I succeed... they will never have been born.<eos> I, too, wish that the plague had never happened.<eos> The great minds lost... your daughter, my wife.<eos> But equally, I mourn the loss of who you might've been.<eos> I would so have loved to have seen her, instead of this.<eos> And very soon... you will.
I don't understand! - They said the city got overwhelmed and our application got lost in the shuffle.<eos> Okay, so expedite a new application!<eos> We'll pay whatever fee...<eos> You don't think that I tried that?<eos> They said no.<eos> So, what now?<eos> We go ahead as planned.<eos> We overextended ourselves on all the deposits. So if we cancel now, we're out the money with nothing to show for it.<eos> - If we get caught...<eos> - We won't.
It's not the only reason.<eos> I just feel like this was my first parenting test and I failed.<eos> I made it about my needs, my own anxieties, not about the baby.<eos> You also gave up going to your own graduation without a thought.<eos> Look, Jane, there's no right or wrong answer.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
I am being pressured by my publicist to take it.<eos> So... You're leaving for mexico?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I also got a job offer Here.<eos> To play the second lead In esteban's telenovela.<eos> Their ratings need a boost.<eos> Normally, I would never consider it, but...<eos> Well, we've just connected.<eos> And I don't want to lose that.<eos> We won't.
Got it.<eos> Wait.<eos> But so will my suit.<eos> Cisco, I'm fried.<eos> I'm losing propulsion control.<eos> Can you see the van?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll catch you.<eos> - You will?<eos> - We will?
Wait.<eos> But so will my suit.<eos> Cisco, I'm fried.<eos> I'm losing propulsion control.<eos> Can you see the van?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll catch you.<eos> - You will?<eos> - We will?<eos> We will.
Kevin, what's going on?<eos> What are you gonna do about Danny? Huh?<eos> You gonna do something?<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> You know that I found a gun in his-- One of his suitcases, huh?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> No, I know you didn't know that.<eos> But it's not- - It's not in his suitcase. It's in my fucking hand right now.<eos> - Listen to me, Kevin-- - lf you won't do something about this...<eos> I will.
Barbara, we've been circling around the subject, but haven't talked about what actually happened to you;<eos> wh... what was done to you. Lee...<eos> You're a nice lady.<eos> I could go there, but I'm not sure you wanna go there with me.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> Has Jim told you he loves you?<eos> - Barbara... - Fair is fair.<eos> Well, I'm telling you all my little secrets.<eos> No, he hasn't.<eos> But he will, though, won't he?
It's Finn.<eos> I can't find a pulse, but she's still warm.<eos> Call medac. Yeah.<eos> This is CSI Morgan Brody, requesting medevac assistance at my location.<eos> How you doing? One day at time.<eos> Isn't that what they say?<eos> So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend.<eos> Yeah, she's just not responsive.<eos> I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.
What's this?<eos> It's Japanese.<eos> Tokyo.<eos> White Dragon.<eos> Wexler told me about this place.<eos> He knew about the 12 Monkeys.<eos> They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
I will talk to him a little bit.<eos> I will give him back his stuff.<eos> And... okay, if he does get ugly, I can outrun Jack.<eos> No problem.<eos> Will you... will you please just let me do this one thing for you?<eos> Please.<eos> - You call me...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you need me immediately.<eos> I-I absolutely will.
But why did you kill my friends?<eos> They had nothing to do with this!<eos> To watch you suffer, Emma.<eos> Although they did help a lot.<eos> After all, what did your BFFs do?<eos> They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
Where's Weiss?<eos> He must have run off.<eos> You all right?<eos> You let him escape?<eos> Nothing useful on her phone, Harold.<eos> Swept the BB.<eos> It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.
Money?<eos> You talking about money?<eos> Yes, to a certain degree.<eos> Well, why didn't you say that?<eos> Come on in.<eos> Come on! It's okay, come on!<eos> It's just their perception, Lizzie.<eos> Perception based on misunderstanding.<eos> They don't want to understand.<eos> They will.
Come with me.<eos> To where?<eos> I got a place in Texas and it's quite and peaceful.<eos> You'd love it.<eos> You'd look pretty good on my, uh, my porch.<eos> I can't even imagine you being either one of those things.<eos> Well, it's a big country.<eos> We can go anywhere we want.<eos> He'll find me.<eos> No, he won't.
And I don't want you in this either.<eos> I can't protect you anymore.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Ruben.<eos> I only have until 8:00 p.m. to tie up loose ends.<eos> No!<eos> That was, uh, intense.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> You know, you answer it, they'll stop calling.<eos> - No, she won't.
Looks like you could use some help.<eos> Only if you're a locksmith.<eos> Looks like the realtor gave us the wrong combination.<eos> I doubt Ryan did that. He's very thorough.<eos> And yet, here I yet, here I stand why don't you try it one more time?<eos> I've tried it about a dozen times, it won't open.<eos> Maybe thirteen's the charm.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> Ok...<eos> I will, but...
FBI!<eos> - Don't shoot!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Emily...<eos> Hays.<eos> I've been dog sitting for Daisy and Kyle while they're away.<eos> Are they in trouble?<eos> Almost done, babe.<eos> We just need to make sure Mark doesn't screw us up tonight.<eos> He won't.
She'd allow me such freedom with herself as only a betrothed woman would allow.<eos> Cardinal bullied me out of saying anything last time. I'm not afraid to speak the truth now.<eos> Good. My Lord, you've said what you have to say.<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> You're a man whose money is almost spent. I'm a man who knows how you've spent it.<eos> You're a man who's borrowed all over Europe. I'm a man who knows your creditors.<eos> One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.<eos> Oh, what are they gonna do?<eos> Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.
But how will you get there?<eos> I've asked Mr Stark if I can ride in the front of one of the cars.<eos> Well, you've got a nerve!<eos> Mr Carson won't like that.<eos> Even Mr Carson can't always have it his own way.<eos> Ooh... Lady Mary's out, miss, and I don't know when she'll be back.<eos> Who shall I say has called?<eos> I'll wait. Er...<eos> Lady Mary could be hours, so there's no point in waiting.<eos> I will, all the same.
In 20 years' time, there won't be a house of this size still standing that isn't an institution.<eos> One pound, seventeen and six.<eos> And sold!<eos> That's it.<eos> They're in the drawing room, they've got coffee and we're done.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
You don't think he...<eos> I wouldn't put anything past Malcolm.<eos> That's why this has to end.<eos> I'm meeting him here tonight.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
You must be feeling such mixed emotions right now.<eos> How's the training going?<eos> Jo's terrible.<eos> If she went up against Kai today, she'd lose in, like, 9 seconds.<eos> Luke totally called that one.<eos> Yeah, but you've got time to whip her into shape.<eos> Has Luke been giving you crap?<eos> He's been texting. I've been ignoring.<eos> If he finds out you're training Jo...<eos> He won't.
It's not fair.<eos> Dad, there's lots of people in my position, and some of them are even sicker than I am.<eos> Like Keith.<eos> And they're ahead of me on the waiting list.<eos> That's just how it is.<eos> How it is does not make it right!<eos> I'm close, though.<eos> Dr. Urman said a call could come at any time.<eos> You can't give up hope.<eos> I won't.
- They were just trying to do the right thing.<eos> How long does it take to get emancipated?<eos> It's... it's gonna be tight.<eos> It's gonna be tight.<eos> So this is what you meant by first things first.<eos> And you just decided that this was the plan, without discussing it with me?<eos> I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up, in case we didn't get the time.<eos> Callie's gonna have to want to do this.<eos> We can't pressure her into it.<eos> We won't.
All right?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> They're making me leave tonight.<eos> There's a plane.<eos> Do the kids know?<eos> The soldiers took my phone before I could call them.<eos> When you see them, tell them that their letters kept me sane.<eos> Okay?<eos> Or... saner than I would've been.<eos> I will.
She's dead.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We have to leave.<eos> No... No, we have to stay.<eos> We have to tell them the truth.<eos> Chuck's already shot at me once.<eos> We just killed his sister, all right?<eos> He's not gonna wait around to talk. Well, I'll talk to him, okay?<eos> He'll listen to me!<eos> No, he won't.
This might be the single biggest murder case in our country's history, and I can give you the exclusive story.<eos> So he just dropped the charges?<eos> Yeah, he must have had a change of heart.<eos> Must've done.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> Good to have you back, Detective Drummond.<eos> Thank you, Detective Voss.<eos> Spoken to Jill yet? No.<eos> She'll come round.<eos> No, she won't.
- Yeah, in here.<eos> - Anyone hurt? - No, we're okay.<eos> - Boy, is it good to see you two.<eos> - Uh... I'll let boden know we're here.<eos> - Listen, about the other night, I really did have to charge my phone.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, i believe you.<eos> - So can we talk?<eos> - We will.
I'll just use this one.<eos> I do not think this is what Martha would want.<eos> We'll never know.<eos> If you fire that gun now, you will kill everything that you have ever stood for.<eos> We have been given a second chance, Walt, both of us.<eos> I will not let you ruin it by shooting Nighthorse out of the sky.<eos> I was planning on waiting for him to land.<eos> Let me have the gun!<eos> Nighthorse is gonna pay for Martha.<eos> He will!
Did she race cars?<eos> We don't know!<eos> We don't know her name, I think if you ask Vicki the color of her mother's eyes, she would say dead.<eos> Or, maybe she would say $7 a seat.<eos> It's bad man, I am telling you. Nobody is safe, nobody is safe.<eos> Blue.<eos> They were a very pale shade of blue.<eos> I'm sorry my show didn't honor her memory properly.<eos> I'll try to make it up to you.<eos> Actually we both will a, a, at the premier of our new show.
Stay with us for updates on this important story, right here at WHXV<eos> - You know something.<eos> - It's Eph.<eos> The suspect.<eos> And the woman is Dutch.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> We should be commending him.<eos> He may have just struck a significant blow.<eos> And he'll probably be executed for it.<eos> They both will.
So, Andrew, what can I do for you?<eos> My friend Ray has a problem that only you can address.<eos> I see.<eos> Ray has a brother in County.<eos> He's also a Parkinson's sufferer.<eos> Ray was working on getting him compassionate release when there was an unfortunate incident with another inmate.<eos> Andrew, it's not the time...<eos> We would appreciate it if you would expedite his release.<eos> And if he gets out and fucks up again?<eos> He won't.
Let's go, Daryll.<eos> How old, your grandson?<eos> Beautiful boy.<eos> Pink cheeks.<eos> - Shut your fucking mouth.<eos> - Whoa, Pop. Take it easy.<eos> I was paying a compliment.<eos> We might wanna stay on her good side.<eos> Mrs. Minassian... I want us to do right by each other.<eos> And of course we will.
_<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Do you remember Endless Love by Scott Spencer?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Very same tone.<eos> - Thank you. Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
Is she ever?<eos> Of course she is.<eos> Have you heard from her since you've been home?<eos> I'm not worried, Rosie.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm sure her mother is on the mend and she's enjoying home and family.<eos> I wonder if that prestigious teaching position was offered to her again.<eos> Well, she turned that job down once.<eos> But a woman can always change her mind.<eos> She won't.
Well, I-I questioned every resident in that halfway house, and it's just like the scummy ex-boyfriend said.<eos> Lianne Sampson had a new guy, but no one's seen him.<eos> He's a ghost, so dead end.<eos> Oh, a-and the balloons that you pulled out<eos> - of Lianne's stomach... - Mm-hmm? ...are from a shoe store that closed down eight years ago.<eos> I-I keep running headfirst into a wall and hoping the wall gives.<eos> Well, you're doing the best that you can.<eos> That's not enough.<eos> He could still get to Jane.<eos> - No, he won't.
I'm just going to have to go back myself.<eos> No.<eos> Mark.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - It's too risky!<eos> You know what, just, um, go down and treat yourself to something special.<eos> I'll be back for you in an hour.<eos> Come home safe, okay?<eos> Don't you dare leave me alone.<eos> I won't.
Howie's over his cold.<eos> I meant to ask.<eos> Johnny made $3 helping the couple next door hang wallpaper.<eos> They're very nice, the Edleys.<eos> He's a-a big guy, a former football player.<eos> Maybe he could help you clean the rain gutters.<eos> I thought you were calling a service.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> You should see how they've cleaned up the place.<eos> Well... You will.
Tessa, what do you want from me?<eos> I just want you to be aware of all the things you ruin for me because you don't remember, or because you promise and then change or your mind, or because you think what's going on with you is more important than what's going on with me.<eos> You have no idea what is going on with me, Tessa!<eos> I know you're planning business trips that'll take you away that'll leave me to fend for myself, which I'm fine to do as long as you don't make it impossible for me to do things<eos> like go to a Bob Dylan concert, which is a small reward for piratically raising myself!<eos> I'm- - I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I'm sorry, too, about the car.<eos> So you'll reschedule with the travel-agent person?<eos> No, Tessa, I will not.
Katrina? You know how much we both cared for him.<eos> We tried everything we could to save him.<eos> This is not your fault. No.<eos> It's yours.<eos> You... are the source of my sorrow, Ichabod Crane.<eos> You are the reason I was not there to raise my son.<eos> I never should have saved your life when the Horseman cut you down.<eos> I never should have put you to sleep.<eos> I should've let you die!<eos> And this time, I will.
Then I'm gonna say, "Hold up, Coleman. "I have something to say to you.<eos> Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"<eos> You'll just need to get your bloodwork done, but you should be all set for next week.<eos> Thanks for squeezing me in.<eos> And thanks for the friends and family discount.<eos> Wait. We didn't say anything about...<eos> Oh, bye bye!<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to say anything.<eos> But I will.
I hope you had a pleasant time.<eos> I wasn't in Paris, Sire.<eos> That's what I was told.<eos> The fault is mine, Sire.<eos> There was an attempt on my life, so<eos> I concealed my whereabouts and condition from the person who did it.<eos> - An attempt by whom?<eos> - I don't have proof, Sire, so I beg your indulgence until I complete my investigation.<eos> She may not come back.<eos> Of course she will.
Ligating the gastric vessels.<eos> The second time, I said you were taking a nap.<eos> And the third time, I said Hunt called you in for an emergent rectal abscess.<eos> I hate lying.<eos> I didn't want to spoil anything.<eos> I need to dissect the splenorenal ligament. Metz.<eos> Hey, okay. Pierce just controlled the gastric bleeds with clips, and now Grey is finishing taking out the spleen.<eos> All right, now, um... he's upset about Dad.<eos> He's obviously having some sort of emotional breakdown, so we'll get him a psych consult.<eos> No, we won't.
Let me go back!<eos> - I want to go...<eos> - It's too late, lady.<eos> You've made your choice.<eos> Mom, wake up.<eos> Please wake up.<eos> She's gone, honey. No.<eos> No!<eos> - We have to go now.<eos> - No, I won't.
[Sniffles] It's never gonna be over now.<eos> - He was our only hope.<eos> - No, not according to John.<eos> We'll find this Calderon guy, and we'll shut down Humanichs ourself with... whatever this is.<eos> Molly.<eos> What did you do to me?<eos> I'll send the rest of your stuff as soon as you're ready, okay?<eos> Don't be sad, Julie.<eos> We'll see each other again.<eos> JULIE: Of course we will.
- We did it?<eos> - Yeah, we did it.<eos> - Well, we all did.<eos> - I think I need to go to the hospital.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid.<eos> Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
No.<eos> Look.<eos> Jeremy has had a rough time here, I know, but that's part of the reason<eos> - why we want him to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.<eos> So can we try this my way now?<eos> We already compelled him into art school.<eos> Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.<eos> He will.
It just...<eos> I know.<eos> Sometimes really terrible things happen to really amazing people.<eos> I have to admit, there is a certain amount of peace knowing I'll be one of the only people in Mystic Falls to die an ordinary death.<eos> I'm exceptionally ordinary.<eos> I'm ok with that.<eos> Caroline is anything but.<eos> She was meant to be extraordinary, and she needs to know how proud I am of her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She will.
Okay, but we're a couple now.<eos> That's cute couple banter.<eos> Look, whatever we are, no one needs to know.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's tell them!<eos> Marco, we've been over this.<eos> If your Uncle Joe finds out, he will kill you.<eos> And if we tell my aunt Mel, she'll tell Joe, and he will kill you.<eos> Nah.<eos> He won't.
Come on, Tom.<eos> Admit it.<eos> Julie was driving when the accident happened. - You're nuts.<eos> - Protecting her is noble.<eos> I understand.<eos> - But you need to tell the truth. - I am telling the truth.<eos> Do you understand that William Thatcher thinks you nearly killed his daughter?<eos> I'm not gonna get Julie in trouble!<eos> He's gonna forgive her, but he will never forgive you.<eos> Sure he will.
That's why Luke and I are gonna bust out our wonder twin powers of persuasion, make dad think that Jo's powerful to overpower Kai, and Luke and I don't have to do the merge.<eos> You're wearing way too much makeup, and he shouldn't be here.<eos> He's not staying, and why are you wearing a tie?<eos> I'm about to ask the leader of the Gemini coven to let us out of a centuries-old tradition.<eos> I kind of need him to take me seriously.<eos> - You should let me talk to him.<eos> - Really bad idea.<eos> Promise me that you'll stay out of it.<eos> What happens if you don't convince him?<eos> - We will.
I'm the world's unluckiest gambler.<eos> I'm just sorry that I wasn't here.<eos> I couldn't, and...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This wasn't your fault.<eos> I need you to stop beating yourself up.<eos> - Can you do that for me?<eos> - Ok.<eos> Can you say it like you mean it?<eos> I will.
In case what?<eos> It happens.<eos> Jackson, they happen, all right?<eos> Mir... miracles, they... they happen to people.<eos> There are documented medical cases that cannot be explained by science.<eos> What if this is one of those and... and we're deciding to do this today, when if we just...<eos> I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> I thought I could, but I can't.<eos> - I won't.
She said, "We love you very much."<eos> I need to be alone.<eos> I don't feel good about leaving right now.<eos> Well, we know that pressure in this situation is counterproductive.<eos> I know that we're not gonna watch her all the time, but today-- If we insist on staying, s-she's just gonna get angry.<eos> She's already angry.<eos> There's no way around this.<eos> We go to work. We hold our breath.<eos> She won't do anything stupid.<eos> She won't.
- You never look at a man when he cries.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Back me up, man.<eos> - You ever let your friends try on your uniform?<eos> - What? No.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Me either.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I'm serious. - Don't do that.<eos> - I won't.
Did it get any scratches?<eos> Max, get out of the car, and help me look for scratches.<eos> You said you were more fun in the Hamptons.<eos> Not true.<eos> Mr. Sulu, fire all phasers.<eos> No scratches.<eos> The Lamborghini is fine.<eos> But thanks to you, I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.<eos> Come on, we have to get this car back.<eos> We will.
I'll remember that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fold, fold, fold. Beanie Man.<eos> How about you?<eos> Huh? Oh!<eos> Look at that!<eos> Looks like I take another monster hand.<eos> Had to protect that monster, monster hand.<eos> Try that bluff again, tough guy. I dare you.<eos> Okay, I will.
Yeah, no, that seems like wood.<eos> This tissue is muscle and cartilage from his esophagus and throat.<eos> It's fibromuscular tubing.<eos> So, after a drawn-out fight, the killer jammed something wood in the victim's neck and then ripped out pieces of his throat?<eos> Gruesome, but we found cause of death.<eos> Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
But that's what we're here to find out.<eos> Suppose you don't care to tell me who you're working for?<eos> Who it is that thinks I'm so valuable?<eos> Why don't you show yourself, huh?<eos> And I'll tell you in person.<eos> Why would I do that? 'Cause!<eos> It'll give you a chance to save your beloved Catherine.<eos> Unless, of course, Carol's killed her already.<eos> I swear... if anything happens to Catherine, I'll...<eos> You'll what, huh?
Look, you have to do what's best for the office, not some individual person.<eos> I have to stand by them.<eos> Will you turn this off?<eos> I-I tried before.<eos> You wouldn't let me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna let you now.<eos> (sighs) Come here.<eos> Just sleep, okay?<eos> You'll know what to do in the morning.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- You cannot do this.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because you will not have the king of France.<eos> When I became ill, with the pain in my ear, and fever, they told me that if the pain returned, I would not survive long.<eos> It has returned.<eos> - No.<eos> They're wrong...<eos> - And when I am gone, you will have no position here but that of a widow, and I cannot abandon you unprotected.<eos> - I cannot, I cannot leave you...<eos> - You won't.
Every guardian I've ever had says the same.<eos> Well, now it's time to listen.<eos> All right.<eos> But first let's go for a ride.<eos> I brought a fine mare with me from the south.<eos> A good jumper.<eos> We'll take the path beyond the chapel.<eos> Oh, I'd like that, but I have business to attend to.<eos> But I thought you said you wanted to talk.<eos> We will.
Everything is not okay.<eos> I can't tell Elizabeth about Lori, Carter,<eos> I already told you why.<eos> Okay, but...<eos> You are not giving her a chance and you're not giving yourself a chance to get past this.<eos> Dad, this is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> Not my abduction, not the egg donor stuff, this one.<eos> You can't just bury something like this.<eos> If you tell her now, she might forgive you.<eos> - She won't.
Just... let me be the one to tell her.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I need to see her face when she finds out.<eos> It's the only way I'll know if she has feelings for Josh.<eos> Okay, but I'm the one that's been keeping this from her, so I should be the one to tell her.<eos> You can stay in my hotel room.<eos> I don't think that-- really?<eos> Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.<eos> Promise me you'll tell her.<eos> I will.
Nothing.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> It's not her fault, Mom.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It has to be done.<eos> No.<eos> It's for her own good.<eos> I will not do this to my daughter.<eos> You won't have to.<eos> I will.
Get what?<eos> The video, obviously.<eos> I thought he was better.<eos> He is... but you never know about tomorrow.<eos> I'd like to keep it handy, just in case.<eos> I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
She's smart. If we want anything to stick, we have to catch her red-handed.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> It'll be fish in a barrel.<eos> Two to three dozen beautiful women roaming the room waiting to be asked on a date.<eos> You will slip in.<eos> Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
You have to understand, nathan, he was a dear friend. [pay phone ringing]<eos> I didn't know anything about his murder. [pay phone ringing]<eos> Do you even believe yourself?<eos> You work in intelligence? How can you not know?<eos> No.<eos> The second it happened, i knew it, But i didn't know they were gonna do it.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will i ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
Yeah.<eos> One serum-enhanced shooter.<eos> Still, JT said that both bullets had small, identical nicks on them. But the one that killed Agent Thomas?<eos> It had trace amounts of plastic on it.<eos> Which is why we have to get back into that room and see what it might've hit.<eos> It could bring us closer to the shooter.<eos> Catherine, come on, those agents have been in and out of that room all day long. Okay?<eos> They're here, still, right now.<eos> If we get caught...<eos> We won't.
Letters between you and Ur troubled son.<eos> Innocent at first glance, but Detective Gordon... you remember him, right? ... he'll feel little bumps.<eos> A secret message written in Braille between you and your son, discussing my escape.<eos> Finally, the knockout gas used to disable the orderlies.<eos> 'Cause, you see, Dad, this guy I was telling you about, he's the one who broke me out of Arkham. He doesn't want anyone to know about that. Obviously.<eos> So... the police will find these letters, mmm, and they'll think, "The blind old fool really loved his son.<eos> What a wonderful father." Oh.<eos> There won't be a dry eye in the house.<eos> They'll never believe it.<eos> Ah, sure, they will.
What then?<eos> Silver, get him to tell you the name, and I will make sure he has the best defense money can buy, I promise.<eos> You think he's guilty.<eos> Why would you believe anything he says?<eos> Because it would come from you.<eos> If you bring me the name, I'll know it's real.<eos> Do you mean that?<eos> I'll call you after I talk to him.<eos> Still got to get the name.<eos> I will.
Reason number five.<eos> Uh, this just in... you're not rich and Chanel is loaded.<eos> So, huh, doi, Neckbrace, that's who I'm bringing home to meet my parents.<eos> Well...<eos> I guess we'll just have to see how it goes bringing Chanel home for Thanksgiving.<eos> Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"... I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old.<eos> This is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> You tell her now she might forgive you.<eos> She won't.
Didn't the FBI seize her parents' house?<eos> Thus the party.<eos> That sounds like a great idea.<eos> I think I'll pass.<eos> Come on, is this about Max?<eos> What about him?<eos> 'Cause he's staying over there and you don't want to see him.<eos> Well, he's also working with Crash, another person I don't want to see.<eos> Well, in any case, everyone's gonna be there if you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
He is?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> And we had a lot to discuss.<eos> Like what?<eos> What happens in the diner stays in the diner.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.<eos> Well, it sounds like you guys have a lot to talk about on the ride home, so good luck with that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Ask him.<eos> He's your general.<eos> Deaf,<eos> I need to send some Rangers out tonight... three of your best riders.<eos> - Colonel Baker, Colonel Sherman.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I hereby order you to serve in rear guard capacity.<eos> Sam, that's a very bad idea.<eos> You're most likely gonna engage Santa Anna.<eos> Most likely I will, sir.
No. No thanks.<eos> - Hello, Father.<eos> - Hola.<eos> - Really nice.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> Can I have some?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Smells great.<eos> - Go enjoy yourself.<eos> I will.
Stop!<eos> This always ends with confusion and counting on fingers.<eos> Have a wonderful time in Vegas, Kyle.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Okay, I better get going.<eos> I don't have an assigned seat on the plane, and I want to make sure I get a middle one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, have an awesome time, okay?<eos> And, um, remember what we agreed to.<eos> - Ii will.
Why does she have a picture of our dad?<eos> To prove that she had an affair with him.<eos> That woman is so crazy.<eos> Does she really expect us to believe that...<eos> Well, it isn't true, is it?<eos> This is why mom and dad are separating?<eos> Tay, I think it's better if you ask them these questions.<eos> No, I'm asking you.<eos> Yeah, and I'm saying, I think it's better if you ask them.<eos> Fine, I will.
- Did you?<eos> - No.<eos> I said yes because I wanted to go.<eos> But speaking of places we've gone lately:<eos> - Did you visit Mom's grave?<eos> - I've been working.<eos> The King's welfare is never ending.<eos> - Yeah. - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine. I will.
I told you about him.<eos> - Is he your boyfriend?<eos> - No, he's not my boyfriend.<eos> Come with us, then.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> - See you, guys.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Come by the house.<eos> I will.
If somebody killed Branch, got to be Nighthorse.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, he's been trying to get at me in all sorts of ways.<eos> He planted those old Indian bones on my golf course to try and stall my development.<eos> But I don't go down easy.<eos> When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I...<eos> I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him.<eos> - I will.
By the way, is the living room still okay?<eos> Or should we go ahead and put Crash in solitary confinement?<eos> Maybe feed him his meals through a slot in the door.<eos> Carter. Look, I really appreciate everything you're doing for him, but I don't understand why you have to be so hard on him.<eos> What, by feeding him and letting him stay here, in our home?<eos> No, I mean, like treating him like he's a criminal.<eos> He is a criminal.<eos> He was a criminal.<eos> Now he just wants a clean slate, and I think, after everything he's been through, he should get that chance.<eos> - He won't.
What have I done?<eos> And I couldn't face anyone 'cause everything I did caused it, but I didn't do it.<eos> It was kinda like a... a hit and run, but I didn't do it.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where's my Jimmy?<eos> - Your Jimmy?<eos> Tell me!<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I will.
- Stop.<eos> Stop. Now slide your finger right underneath that rib.<eos> And with your other hand, right above that finger, push the skewer in about an inch.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Ruby, yes you can.<eos> What if we're wrong?<eos> I'm not wrong. Okay.<eos> - Ruby, you can do this.<eos> She could puncture her heart.<eos> She won't.
You're in control here.<eos> Could I put them here?<eos> Or even...there?<eos> Wherever.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> They obviously belong in a train-yard set.<eos> And this guy needs a hat.<eos> There we go.<eos> This will make me feel better?<eos> It will.
Could I put them here?<eos> Or even...there?<eos> Wherever.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> They obviously belong in a train-yard set.<eos> And this guy needs a hat.<eos> There we go.<eos> This will make me feel better?<eos> It will.<eos> It really will.
It's Dwayne!<eos> I win Hollywood!<eos> Celebrate now, you stuck-up snobs.<eos> But our plucky little school is going to surprise you.<eos> We will surprise you all!<eos> Well, Lisa, we didn't score a single point.<eos> That was surprising.<eos> Oh, you'll get them next time, honey.<eos> No!<eos> No, we won't!
Your undying loyalty.<eos> You'll be working for me.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this. It will calm your nerves.<eos> You're insane.<eos> You're going down.<eos> I'm getting the police.<eos> Let her go.<eos> She said she's gonna go to the cops.<eos> She won't.
We got less than two miles, then we're going over the cliff.<eos> Give me some slack.<eos> When we regain control, Paige, you steer us to the side of the road.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Or not.<eos> A minute, 32 until impact.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Uh, please tell me you did not just drop the screwdriver.<eos> Okay, I won't.
What the hell, Richard?<eos> How'd you not see this? Hey, all of her injuries were consistent with her fall.<eos> None of us would have thought to look any further.<eos> I know you're worried, but we have her.<eos> Hey. I need you to tell me why you're here.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> She told me to go.<eos> - Good.<eos> Go.<eos> - I will.
- and betrayed by men.<eos> - Who want you.<eos> They always do.<eos> Kings and everyday bastards alike.<eos> You prefer kings.<eos> - Bash.<eos> - Eventually a man will come along with enough power to make you feel safe.<eos> But until then, you or any woman is better off wed.<eos> Allow my name to protect you.<eos> I will.
I'm sure you understand this.<eos> It might look like you're just... you're just making things up.<eos> Just, um, toying with us.<eos> Y-Y-You get me what I've asked for... .. and then I'll tell you.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think I'm struggling very hard not to punch him in the face.<eos> - You think it's bollocks? - Yeah.<eos> I think it's bollocks.<eos> - Except whatever name he gives us...<eos> - Which he won't.
Blah, blah, blah. But, nah, that's not true.<eos> Those of us that... do what we do, we're just burdened with so much information.<eos> We sit around and wait for the other shoe to drop, knowing how inevitable it is and hoping that we can protect the citizens when it does.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... you gonna tell me what you're really doing here or not?<eos> Not.<eos> You know, in America, we have this thing.<eos> It's called interagency cooperation.<eos> You should try it sometime.<eos> Perhaps I will.
Nice deflection.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nick, wait up.<eos> - I know you're in trouble.<eos> - I'm always in trouble.<eos> But this time it's because of me.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to tell your dad what you did for me last night.<eos> He sees me a certain way and that's never going to change.<eos> Yes, it will.
Listen to me.<eos> You're writing checks your ass can't cash, all right?<eos> Now you're getting cold feet.<eos> Are you projecting?<eos> You seriously want to be a human?<eos> I want to be with Elena.<eos> And what did Stefan say?<eos> Do you honestly want to spend your last night as a single man debating my existential crisis?<eos> Damon, tell me you told your brother of 166 years that you're planning on becoming human.<eos> I will.
On our... our first date.<eos> This... this is Sam, right?<eos> And I'm... I'm actually remembering this?<eos> This isn't... I'm not just remembering what you told me?<eos> No, the sandwich story is news to us.<eos> I want to see his eyes.<eos> You said they were beautiful.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I wish he'd open them.<eos> He will.
It's my pleasure to serve the queen.<eos> Go.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I'm sure you'll agree that discretion is in our best interests.<eos> Your secrets are safe with me.<eos> Of course in exchange, Helena is going to need a little favor.<eos> From one Queen to another.<eos> - If I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
Dollie! Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Petrus' eyes showed me all, witch killer.<eos> You will kill no witches tonight.<eos> You have my Dollie.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Taking away your shame and giving you back your glory.<eos> Do you not think that this flesh has seen a lifetime of wounds and scars and the ravages of time?<eos> And yet, behold... It retains its youth.<eos> And so, too, will yours.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> "They know, and it'll all be over soon."<eos> That's what you said upstairs on the phone.<eos> So who were you talking to?<eos> Why should I answer when I can see you won't believe me?<eos> Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too. - Yeah?
I am.<eos> There is a cancer at the heart of your family.<eos> That guarantees sleepless nights whether you open it or not.<eos> So which will it be?<eos> Worrying or wondering?<eos> Carolyn Bligh...<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Don't do what I think you're doing.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Thank you, Dr. Zuber.<eos> Please, you're a friend of Dani's... call me Sebastian.<eos> Hey George, could we please set up a time for tomorrow?<eos> Huh. I see you got my message.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And in the history of bad ideas, this ranks just above the $2 bill and jeggings.<eos> We need access to Dani's life.<eos> Most of it was in that lab and in her office... it's my only way in.<eos> But when the good doc figures out that you're faking a brain injury, then what?<eos> He won't.
Next time it's not me sitting here.<eos> It's someone with a gun or a syringe, and you're already dead.<eos> (Tenant) You need to stop.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your father was not murdered by his mistress.<eos> - So I'm right.<eos> - It doesn't matter. You're just as dead.<eos> The only reason they killed your father instead of you is because of what he knew.<eos> Now, you keep asking questions and you're gonna end up in the same place.<eos> We... we both will.
I slept like a baby. Dot, dot, dot."<eos> Look, Cary, I was worried about you.<eos> You were going to prison, and... and it wasn't right.<eos> That's why I did it.<eos> Make me your lawyer, Kalinda.<eos> Let me fight this for you.<eos> No, Cary. I...<eos> Finn's doing it.<eos> - I'll do it better.<eos> - No, you won't.
We know he worked in the same house as you and that he left on the day that you stole the jewels from your mistress.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - And those jewels were never found and you've kept silent.<eos> But we believe he profited from the theft.<eos> We want you to testify to that effect as a character witness.<eos> We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
- You just said...<eos> - She still wants it here, yes.<eos> But not by you.<eos> Dr. Barliss will continue to handle this case with one of our other C.T. surgeons.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> - She doesn't trust you.<eos> - And, quite frankly, I don't blame her.<eos> - Look, I will talk to her, and...<eos> - No, you won't.
When he didn't show, I went across the street to wait for him at a coffee shop.<eos> We go there, show your picture around, they gonna remember you?<eos> They should.<eos> Oh, and just in case, check with the MTA, too.<eos> I had to take four different busses just to get there.<eos> I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.<eos> Course it will.
Hey, there's no way.<eos> Someone's setting him up.<eos> Christopher. Christopher, don't.<eos> King, they got the wrong guy.<eos> Messier, you got the wrong guy! Hey! Chris.<eos> - Chris!<eos> Cade!<eos> I'll figure this out!<eos> Don't worry! King, we gotta do something!<eos> We will.
Clark and I already called for backup.<eos> Where are the others?<eos> Hanna and Caleb are checking the coatrooms.<eos> Aria was checking the bathrooms.<eos> Somebody should check the kitchens.<eos> Where's Alison?<eos> - Is she not here?<eos> - She was, but...<eos> - We can't find her.<eos> - But we will.
Okay, I'll go.<eos> I worry about my sister sometimes.<eos> Check out hashtag "IhabRocks."<eos> It's trending like crazy.<eos> Going after Al Fayeed like that is a mistake.<eos> Is it?<eos> Because I'm thinking of putting down my paint can and picking up a gun.<eos> Shut up, Marwan.<eos> The one thing we've always said is that violence won't bring down the regime.<eos> But graffiti and anonymous chat rooms will?
We are better than them.<eos> Not if we kill.<eos> They made us kill.<eos> We had to stop it.<eos> I had to stop it.<eos> With life, there's possibility, even if we never let him out.<eos> - I'd get out.<eos> - Even if we never let him out, he could know what he's done. - He could know--<eos> - I don't want to have to kill you, Morgan.<eos> You won't.
I'll be right back.<eos> Sorry I crashed your party.<eos> How did you even know I was here?<eos> You and that guy were talking about it this morning.<eos> - I didn't know where else to go, so...<eos> - What happened?<eos> I was looking for a place to sleep tonight, you know, someplace safe, and a couple guys jumped me.<eos> You... you said you could help me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I will.
Mrs Fenton, you've seen the news, the appeals.<eos> We have reason to believe that Mimi's bo...<eos> She's dead.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Look, I just want a sample of your DNA for identification purposes.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Mimi died the day I kicked her out.<eos> She stopped being my daughter long before any of this.<eos> Look, if you change your mind...<eos> She won't.
[phone rings] I'm gonna have Mouse triangulate the cell towers on the girl's phone and check all social media.<eos> We can find out if she electronically checked in anywhere during the day.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll check the sex offender files and recently released parolees.<eos> Good.<eos> That was Olinsky at Chicago Med.<eos> Victoria didn't make it.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> We'll get him.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we will.
Nothing further.<eos> And brutally forcing himself inside of her, again and again.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Counselor, good job.<eos> - Did you see what we saw?<eos> - The real Greg Yates?<eos> I just hope the jury saw it.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will.
I didn't tell her to lie.<eos> I told her about the consequences of her actions, that's all.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> She was about to contradict Brett's alibi.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> This is not the way I want to practice the law.<eos> Oh, what, you mean successfully?<eos> So, what if the prosecution gets to her?<eos> They won't.
As magistrate, you owe it to the people of Salem to investigate yourself.<eos> Come with me to the crags and then decide who speaks the truth.<eos> You want to save this town.<eos> You want to be Salem's leader.<eos> All I ask is that you see for yourself. I won't have any more of this nonsense.<eos> N-no, doctor.<eos> We shall go, all three of us.<eos> With all due respect, Magistrate...<eos> As magistrate, it is not your respect I require but your obedience.<eos> As you will.
Let's go.<eos> Okay, and... 16, 17, 18!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Spent the day in basic training.<eos> Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
He risked his own life so that you could finish what you've started.<eos> Yes, but if he trades up and I don't make it off the hill, I won't be able to finish anything.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Nothing changes.<eos> You wait for the convoy and you take it out to the site.<eos> Do you have the schematics for the circuits?<eos> I don't need the schematics.<eos> I built the circuits.<eos> Do you understand what happens if the test succeeds?<eos> It won't.
All of them?<eos> Tunnel collapse victims.<eos> No, no, we have a plastics O.R. available.<eos> That's all the way at the other end of the building.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - Nothing's impossible.<eos> We just... all right, we clear a path to the east elevator.<eos> Move everything out of the way, stop all foot traffic, lock down the elevator.<eos> Can he make it that far?<eos> No, but he will.
So you've just said.<eos> Who?<eos> Who killed him?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> A member of my team.<eos> The good news is...<eos> I've been tracking channels, And there hasn't been any chatter.<eos> None.<eos> It's almost as if they haven't discovered his body yet.<eos> But they will.
For?<eos> Angelo's birthday dinner.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Sorry, I can't.<eos> - I have my ride-along.<eos> - Tonight?<eos> You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
Just comes up with the oil.<eos> They're just burning it off.<eos> Why don't they collect it?<eos> They're making so money up here they don't bother picking up loose change.<eos> Billy!<eos> Cody and I would just like to say thank you for the big send off, and for investing your hard-earned money in us.<eos> We're opening three laundromats in North Dakota, 'cause that place is booming.<eos> We're not gonna let you down.<eos> I promise.<eos> - We won't.
I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Is something weighing on you of late?<eos> You seem very... vigilant.<eos> As a devoted wife should be. To keep her blessings in good order.<eos> Yea.<eos> Seems my blessings have yet to settle into good order.<eos> You have known only the life of a journeyman, Maddy.<eos> Your rough spirit will quiet in time.<eos> And when Luca is of age to swing the ax, he will have no struggle with a settled life.<eos> Luca will not have this life.<eos> Of course he will.
I'm okay.<eos> Well, if what you say is true, it seems like a clear case of abandonment.<eos> Now, I don't think we'll have any trouble getting a favorable settlement.<eos> And you're entitled to alimony, child support.<eos> I could probably even secure rights to the house, since you were living there at the time of the marriage.<eos> All I want is full custody of our daughter.<eos> Well, that might be a little trickier.<eos> The legal system is still generally biased towards the mother when it comes to custody.<eos> If your wife chooses to fight it...<eos> She won't.
I was just thinking... maybe 50 tour dates is too many.<eos> ♪ ... don't make no sense at all ♪ ♪ but I do ♪ ♪ I do ♪<eos> Hey, have you seen Juliette?<eos> She was just here.<eos> Sorry, I haven't.<eos> ♪ I couldn't change it if I wanted to ♪<eos> ♪ ♪ Oh, I may be crazy ♪ ♪ but I still need you, baby ♪<eos> ♪ you're the hurricane and you're the thunder ♪ ♪ you're the ledge that's gonna be my fall ♪<eos> - We'll talk soon?<eos> - Yes, we will.

That's why you're here.<eos> The people who reached out to my son, they're reaching out to others.<eos> They're building cells on our soil.<eos> We need to infiltrate them, poison their network.<eos> I have a plan, but I need you.<eos> I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
Yeah, Rita helped me get a waiver, since, you know, I have a record.<eos> All I gotta do now is pass the physical, and I start basic training.<eos> Good luck, girl.<eos> You think this place is strict.<eos> Yeah, but in the army I get to shoot an M32 grenade launcher.<eos> Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
They're not gonna bend on that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> I just got out of a marriage, and I wasn't working, and everything is in my husband's name.<eos> So I just don't have an employment history or previous addresses.<eos> Well, those are the requirements.<eos> Well, can't you just give me a break?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Get your ex-husband to co-sign for you.<eos> He won't.
What's happening?<eos> Hey! - Come on!<eos> So much for stealthy.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - And this is a good idea how?<eos> - I didn't kill him, I-I just iced him.<eos> - And screwed Coulson.<eos> He's working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two.<eos> - When she finds out...<eos> - She won't.
Only one shot.<eos> But I won't lie.<eos> It scared the crap out of me.<eos> I got the protection detail the next day.<eos> Did we tie the bullet to a Fifth Dynasty weapon?<eos> No, which was this really stupid mistake on their part.<eos> If the 5Ds had used a gun that we knew they owned...<eos> You'd be conflicted out.<eos> Guess they thought I'd recuse myself.<eos> I won't.
[ Raises volume ] Look, I, um... [ Sighs ] I can't talk about it.<eos> All right, Sean, we understand that this is hard, but if you tell us the truth now, that will give us mitigating circumstances to discuss with the D.A., and that...<eos> I don't wanna talk about it!<eos> Can you not understand?<eos> - I don't wanna talk about it!<eos> - Do you want Henry growing up, feeling that he's responsible for what you did to Chandler?<eos> Do you think that that's going to make it better for him?<eos> It won't! And if you don't talk to us, Sean, this goes to a courtroom.<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I don't have to take the stand.<eos> No, no, but Henry will.
No, thank you.<eos> I don't want to just be pretending.<eos> I wanted to thank you for today, but I am a happily married woman.<eos> The church teaches us that a child is a gift, a gift from God.<eos> However, I've never been in your position.<eos> Duck bill ready?<eos> How far along is she?<eos> 11, 12 weeks, she says.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Georgie, where are you?<eos> Oh, dear God, where is he?<eos> James, I can't find him.<eos> I can't find him!<eos> Livvy, just calm down.<eos> I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
No one says no to me !<eos> I must have slept in, why didn't you wake me?<eos> You want some breakfast?<eos> The vines, they're not growing like they should.<eos> Gino, what do you mean?<eos> They should look healthier, there was a frost this morning.<eos> Frost? Frost can kill the baby vines.<eos> We should have planted earlier.<eos> Every day Bella, I look in that corner and think, that's where the winery will go.<eos> Darling, it will, just..
No, I'm not going to the wake. I can take her, it's fine.<eos> Why don't you both come to mine?<eos> The kids need each other now, Jo, and we have to start getting used to this.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We'll need a routine, now Hal's living with me.<eos> And he'll want to see a lot of Melly.<eos> You know how close they are.<eos> Nothing's decided yet.<eos> He might... want to come home.<eos> No, he won't, Jo.
Hatred of homosexuals.<eos> Have you decided what your turtle will be called yet?<eos> Quiet, grandma's sleeping.<eos> My choice is that he should be called Stefan.<eos> Good, huh?<eos> I can help you find a name if you want.<eos> When I grow up will you take care of me.<eos> Then we'll have a bird, for then Mom will be dead.<eos> Mom won't die.<eos> Well, someday, she will.
I'm in a meeting.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> You want to get that message out there, too?<eos> What message?<eos> That your foundation does deals with Hezbollah?<eos> A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
I told you to leave this alone.<eos> Take him away.<eos> You were right, Siddiq.<eos> We will not dishonor his sacrifice.<eos> I'm sorry, Abu Omar.<eos> I overstepped my bounds.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I should have consulted you first.<eos> And, uh, I won't make the same mistake again.<eos> No, you won't.
The media is not my concern, and I don't work for you.<eos> Now, if someone here wants to cut open a 5-year-old girl, see how it makes you feel, be my guest.<eos> Doctor, we need to break the news to this little girl's parents.<eos> - They haven't been notified yet?<eos> - No.<eos> Is there a reason for that?<eos> We don't work for you, either.<eos> Okay, guys, could we...<eos> Okay, I just... I don't want anything I say here showing up on "Live at 5:00."<eos> It won't.
I had sex with someone else when we were still together.<eos> You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?<eos> And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.<eos> Carmen knows that I kissed you.<eos> The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.<eos> It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
Louis, we've already been over this.<eos> His lawyer's his wife.<eos> You're never gonna sign him.<eos> Well, that's just it. I don't need to sign him.<eos> I only need to pretend to sign him.<eos> Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, And I tell him I'll give him a piece, He'll know it's worth a fortune to him<eos> And he'll overturn the vote. And what are you gonna do when he finds out The whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
It amounts to the same thing.<eos> Now the only person who can connect him to us is you.<eos> That's why I'm exactly the wrong person to meet with her.<eos> Why don't you just finish this once and for all?<eos> There have been too many bodies already.<eos> Need to be smart now.<eos> What's worrying you?<eos> We used to be close.<eos> - She'll see right through me.<eos> - No, she won't.
I won't remind you why.<eos> I don't wish to be the target of your working man's wrath.<eos> Not again.<eos> I went looking for your blanket, to no avail.<eos> Frederick, the old steward, told me it was a gift from King Henry.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I heard you talking with Charles.<eos> I know Francis is dying.<eos> You mustn't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
He wants her for something.<eos> - Well, looks like he left his bachelor pad in the sewers.<eos> - Grodd's a big-ass gorilla.<eos> He can't just waltz through downtown in the middle of the day without anybody noticing.<eos> - Right, and if there's been sightings, then we might be able to approximate his location.<eos> - I can call CCPD.<eos> They can access the tip hotline, send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.<eos> - Good.<eos> - We gotta get her back.<eos> - We will.
Ok, are you planning on giving me a hair sample to run forensics on in the near future?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Well, I did. And you were pretty shaken after the fact.<eos> And then Felicity found out, and you guys had a pretty big fight, and it sounded like it was over between you two.<eos> What was the fight about?<eos> I'm pretty sure you're someone's father, Oliver.<eos> So when we go up against Savage, you're not focused.<eos> And then, Kendra can't access her powers, and then the tech they're developing to counteract Savage's staff does not work, and...<eos> Everyone dies, Oliver.<eos> This time they won't.
You want him to become more powerful, more full of... speed force.<eos> You're fattening him up like a Christmas goose.<eos> The more power he has, the more I can take and you're going to help me.<eos> Let me see her first.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Please help me.<eos> Don't let him take me back there.<eos> I won't...
She must be desperate.<eos> She has to support Ben or she'll lose him.<eos> I couldn't care less about Lori's problems.<eos> Someone has to do something to stop her.<eos> And I guess it's not gonna be you.<eos> ♪♪ Excuse me, number two, could you hand me a beer?<eos> I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you.<eos> By the end of the year, you'll be back where you belong... many paces behind me.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Avenging Earl Ragnar is not my business!<eos> That's for his son!<eos> You're next to die, Ubba.<eos> Then fight me!<eos> And you'll see who is next to die!<eos> Fight me!<eos> Lord, we're negotiating.<eos> You will not say another word!<eos> He will not say another word!<eos> He will not, no.
You do not need to "get this done."<eos> I'll make a plea to Alfred.<eos> She's here, praise God.<eos> You should stand and look respectful, if not entirely clean.<eos> - How's she look?<eos> - Terrified, I'll bet.<eos> If you could be brief with the ceremony, father Beocca, I would be grateful.<eos> I have business with the King.<eos> - The bride has been given her price?<eos> - She will.
I have not yet finished.<eos> I beg your pardon, Lord, but if I may.<eos> It is clear that, like me, the arseling here is guilty.<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> Because of my own guilt, and because of my respect for Uhtred as a warrior, I request that he dies at my sword.<eos> You wish to become executioner, Leofric?<eos> My plea is for a fight to the death, Lord... me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the Victor and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he should win this fight to the death, - what then?<eos> - He will not.
And the Taliban unit, are we gonna - beat them there?<eos> - Too close to call.<eos> We have to warn them.<eos> - We have to tell them to move.<eos> - Tell them we know where they are, they'll think it's a ploy.<eos> Not to mention, it'll blow - the element of surprise.<eos> - Which won't matter if the Taliban get there first.<eos> I'd agree with you, Bess, but we promised them that their families would be safe in the U.S. before they surrender.<eos> I don't see how they're going to trust us if we change the rules of the game now.<eos> - They won't.
Yes.<eos> I'm so sorry, dana.<eos> Lower your weapons, everyone.<eos> Dana tried--<eos> No, no.<eos> Hotch:<eos> But you also love your sister.<eos> We know you're sad, dana, But hurting nicole is not gonna make that go away.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Oh, the usual.<eos> She should be regent, I'm sucking France dry.<eos> Prettiest vampire I've ever seen.<eos> There are so many things I wish we'd done together:<eos> eating oranges freshly plucked from the trees in Nice, dancing under the stars at the Louvre.<eos> Well, we were married there.<eos> Ah.<eos> So many ceremonies, so many nobles, and we barely got to dance.<eos> We will do all those things.<eos> We will.
Come on.<eos> Hey, cuz, come on, let me see those moves.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> STEVE:<eos> No, I'm awake.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> That was some night.<eos> Yeah, it was pretty epic.<eos> Um... I was kind of hoping you and I could talk a little bit this morning.<eos> We will.
- (Denise) Oh, my God!<eos> Anyway, it has been a pleasure getting to know you, and I-I-I'm just gonna leave right now, because I am still talking.<eos> And I am still listening.<eos> - Yes, you are. Thank you, Kristin. Ah...<eos> - Oh, you are so sweet!<eos> Come on, sweetie. I-I think you've said everything you want to say, and maybe some stuff you didn't.<eos> [Sighs] It was the greatest moment of my life.<eos> Don't ever let me do something that stupid again.<eos> Trust me...<eos> I won't.
What I don't get is, if Hancock and Spilatro had been friends all this time, then why did he turn on them?<eos> Well, Hancock's parole officer is listed as Bart Lewis.<eos> Maybe he can shed a little light.<eos> You and Halstead check it out.<eos> All right.<eos> How's Ruzek?<eos> Go talk to the parole officer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now if you leave the city limits...<eos> - Hey, hey, I won't.
That's not my style.<eos> Lane's told me about your style.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> You don't get to the top without stepping on someone along the way, and I get it.<eos> I'm not jeopardizing my career just so you can get back at him.<eos> I know what Lane did to me, and I'm gonna stop him from doing it to somebody else.<eos> It could get ugly.<eos> I just want you to be prepared for the fallout.<eos> You should go home.<eos> I will.
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> But you don't deserve this boat! Or any of this!<eos> Why is everything so far away?<eos> Got it.<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> - I'm here to help you out.<eos> - Don't.<eos> I'll just say more terrible things.<eos> No, you won't.
And he gets what we're trying to do.<eos> POTUS still values your counsel.<eos> A good word from you would go a long way.<eos> Well, I'll think about it.<eos> Don't piss me off, Craig.<eos> Why not?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> My job is to provide the president an impartial opinion.<eos> If Reeves is the right candidate for the job, I'll back him.<eos> If not... I won't.
Hang in there, Kepner.<eos> Hey, are we ready?<eos> Uh, which approach are you going to use?<eos> Jade's fall caused her spinal fracture to become severely unstable, so Pierce and I will have to repair it at the same time.<eos> We sit Jade up for a craniotomy, it would paralyze her forever.<eos> So we'll be doing this surgery endonasally.<eos> - Which is the wrong approach.<eos> - We're out of options. Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
Two?<eos> No, Four!<eos> Two is not enough.<eos> - Four, four, four.<eos> - Four.<eos> At least four.<eos> I'm afraid of the other guy.<eos> He's the only one who can win the Ballon d'Or. Huh?<eos> The other guy could destroy everything.<eos> No. No, he won't.
Uh, one thing you should know, though.<eos> Uh, he thinks you're a deadbeat who ran out on me when I got pregnant with Gerald.<eos> What? !<eos> I didn't know you were pregnant.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> It was something he heard... from me.<eos> Why would you lie about that?<eos> I knew my family would think I was crazy for raising Gerald alone, so I just made it up, so that it would seem like it was out of my hands.<eos> Well, go tell him the truth.<eos> I will.
This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness!<eos> I think you can give him a little of your time!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Find everything you needed today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
Promise me you'll stay.<eos> I will, I will.<eos> I promise, I promise.<eos> I see... such beauty.<eos> Such beauty you have brought me.<eos> You must...<eos> You must wed again.<eos> You must love again.<eos> I can't.<eos> I will never.
It isn't right.<eos> You took a stand.<eos> I admired that.<eos> That's why I kept my mouth shut all these years, and that's why I'm going to help you out of this mess now.<eos> What does NCIS have on me?<eos> The camera connecting you to Meyers.<eos> It's circumstantial.<eos> Yes, but... shooting Meyers really mucked things up.<eos> You need to get ahead of NCIS before they find something.<eos> They won't.
Yup, thanks, Elliot.<eos> Well... you like to surprise a girl, don't you?<eos> Still mad, huh?<eos> Please, sit.<eos> Carrying around a grudge that big must be exhausting.<eos> - This won't take long.<eos> - Kelly...<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Did you get your rank reinstated?<eos> Not yet, I will.
The paper said he killed himself.<eos> Please... ..you have to find out what happened to him...and who...<eos> Who what?<eos> Have you talked to the police?<eos> No, no, I can't.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> You're the coroner.<eos> He didn't kill himself.<eos> You have to help him.<eos> Of course I will.
One, You're on trash duty the rest of the month.<eos> Including shining that outside dumpster.<eos> Two, Another stunt like that on shift and you're out of here.<eos> No questions.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, sorry, Chief.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I apologize.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Did he give you this?<eos> To remember Paris?<eos> That was what?<eos> A month before he met Christine?<eos> Before she stole him from you.<eos> Made him take away your job, the only thing you had left.<eos> 39 years?<eos> I understand - I understand why you'd want to make him pay.<eos> Make her pay.<eos> She won't, Rose.
We just sat down.<eos> The girl's room.<eos> You gonna powder your nose?<eos> Ooh, what a nice ass.<eos> Hey, Bobby, Bobby,<eos> Bobby come here.<eos> Pavel, can't you see I'm busy with work?<eos> Ah, yes, you're very busy with the old man.<eos> I thought we were gonna spend the afternoon together.<eos> - And we will. - Yeah?
That's why I put this building up.<eos> And I made those tanks, I made my own farms.<eos> I just wish that, you know, he could...<eos> [Strang] There's nowhere that Steven Avery will be able to go to get his reputation back if he wins this trial.<eos> He didn't commit the rape he did 18 years for.<eos> We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He never did.<eos> He never will here.
Get those arms up.<eos> Get 'em up, get 'em up.<eos> Hmm?<eos> What's this?<eos> What do you got here, hmm?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Tough neighborhood.<eos> Bet your ass it is, old man.<eos> You can it back on the way out.<eos> Yeah, I will.
My aunt taught me to do them when people had forgotten their manners.<eos> - Oh, give me strength.<eos> - Mr Brown, you can trust me.<eos> There really was an explorer.<eos> And if we can find him, I know he'll give me a home.<eos> A proper home, like yours.<eos> Now I've got an idea.<eos> But I'm going to need your help.<eos> - This is never going to work.<eos> - (Paddington) Of course it will.
That's how I got out in time.<eos> I knew they were still inside.<eos> But I just kept running.<eos> And I kept going until I couldn't hear them screaming any more.<eos> I was the oldest.<eos> They were screaming for me.<eos> You were only a child.<eos> After that day, I swore that I would never love anyone ever again.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
Ah, Miss Brittain.<eos> Surprised to be here, no doubt.<eos> - Considering I had no tuition.<eos> - Yes, and how it showed. Luckily you also displayed an original mind.<eos> Though whether you can bring any discipline to bear on it is another matter.<eos> "Oxford is everything we dreamed of and more.<eos> "If only you were here to share it with me, Roland.<eos> "I want to ask you to leave the army,<eos> "but I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
I throw the javelin.<eos> I hate cricket, too.<eos> And I suck at it.<eos> I'm Rinku.<eos> I'm Dinesh.<eos> If you win, what are you going to do with the money?<eos> I'm gonna buy my father a new truck.<eos> I understand.<eos> You should get him a driver, too.<eos> Maybe I will.
How do you know that?<eos> He died three weeks ago.<eos> Wouldn't even let me say goodbye.<eos> Not even let me kiss him goodbye.<eos> He's dead?<eos> So sorry.<eos> It can happen this fast?<eos> It just did.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> No one else will.
Shit.<eos> God damn.<eos> I'll call later when I know more about the memorial.<eos> I have this tradition.<eos> It's something I do now when a friend dies.<eos> I save his Rolodex card.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?<eos> I won't do that.<eos> No, I won't.
I got so much anger.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I can see you don't wanna be here and you're scared.<eos> I see you don't know what's happening to you.<eos> I can see you don't want to hurt anybody.<eos> -It's gonna be all right.<eos> -Got a clear shot.<eos> Standing by.<eos> -I don't want them shooting me anymore.<eos> -They won't.
For you this has been a mountain holiday.<eos> - Your mission ends here.<eos> - No.<eos> You can go back to your family.<eos> They're waiting for you.<eos> Tell your parents that you'll be home for dinner.<eos> And your wife Yedé will be there, celebrating your return.<eos> You must be eager to see... your son Ravil after all this time.<eos> Of course I want to see my son Ravil.<eos> And I Will.
And I saw something wonderful.<eos> Hallelujah<eos> Hallelujah<eos> I saw angels and they were singing to me.<eos> Can we sing We Will Rock You?<eos> Colton, do you know who I am?<eos> You're not afraid?<eos> Nobody here wants to hurt me.<eos> That's right, Colton.<eos> And nobody here ever will.
Our lives were in each other's hands.<eos> We're going to bring Seanie back, all right.<eos> He's cool, we got his back. Yeah, well, you need to tell him he got a reason to get his black backside here early.<eos> Now you go. Go on and rest, all right.<eos> - He's beautiful.<eos> - I know.<eos> Come on, men.<eos> What's the matter, baby?<eos> What's the matter? I just want you to come back early.<eos> I will.
It's all right.<eos> Katniss Everdeen?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came... I came to see you.<eos> What about the baby?<eos> - I lost it.<eos> - Are you fighting, Katniss?<eos> You here to fight with us?<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
That's not going to happen.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> It's what happens to people who do what you do.<eos> I'm not stupid. I can handle it.<eos> Nothing's ever gone wrong.<eos> It has for me.<eos> Too many times.<eos> And I'm tired. I'm afraid.<eos> - What if I stop?<eos> - You won't. - Why?
- You think I won't ?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Try.<eos> - There.<eos> - That's all you got?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Did it again.<eos> Did it again!<eos> - Dylan, stop. Stop it!<eos> - I won't.
- It is.<eos> Very painful, yeah.<eos> So you're artists, heh?<eos> No, we're collectors from New York.<eos> Yeah, this guy's an architect.<eos> I always wanted to see New York.<eos> Greatest city in the world.<eos> - Have you ever seen Munich?<eos> - No.<eos> But we will soon.
You know what I mean? Have you ever felt like you led somebody down the wrong path?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> You know, it's interesting, my wife, she's always wanted to go to Europe.<eos> I finally put this big trip together, then at the last second, she cancels.<eos> She says that she needed to be here for this big break in her acting career.<eos> A break that you told her was coming.<eos> I did.<eos> And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?<eos> No.<eos> It will.
Hi.<eos> I need a room for the night.<eos> $18.<eos> Unless... you have a companion joining you later. If you have a companion, it's more.<eos> I don't have a companion.<eos> So it's $18.<eos> For now.<eos> It'll stay $18.<eos> Unless someone comes later.<eos> Which he won't.
Faster!<eos> Poor souls.<eos> Da!<eos> Da!<eos> He hit it!<eos> - He hit the dragon!<eos> - No.<eos> He did, he hit it's mark, I saw.<eos> These arrows can not pierce it's hide.<eos> Actually, nothing will.
I am a just and honorable man.<eos> Who did you pick this rose for?<eos> My youngest daughter.<eos> She is the most precious thing to me.<eos> Then I will give you one day to say goodbye to your loved ones.<eos> You only need to whisper the words:<eos> "more than anything in the world,"<eos> to your horse, and he will bring you here.<eos> - I will not return.<eos> - Oh, yes you will.
No, really, I can see how good you must be dancing through borders.<eos> But the reality of the situation is, sweetheart, you and I both know I'm not getting out of this freezer alive, so enough of the bullshit.<eos> Then save me, Robert.<eos> Please save me.<eos> Baby...<eos> I wouldn't give you the ice off my eyebrows.<eos> Let him go.<eos> If you don't release me, he will break that man's neck.<eos> Yeah, well, I might do you the same favor.<eos> - You won't.
Here we go.<eos> You're the sole survivor of a massive explosion, there's moon-buggy footage of you tampering with an unknown object at ground zero, and I'm looking for an inside man.<eos> Okay, so this your idea of a second chance?<eos> Accusing me of being a terrorist?<eos> Your excuse you're not is that you saw a flower.<eos> And we're back!<eos> It's only been, what, like, two years?<eos> And in two minutes, you're trying to get inside my head.<eos> Because I need to know if you're working for the russians, and you won't just tell me if I ask you.<eos> Uh... yes, I will.
Straight to school.<eos> Work hard, son.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will.<eos> Tuur!<eos> - Have a nice day, guys.<eos> See you this afternoon.<eos> - Bye.<eos> My dad wants me to join the Hitler Youth Storm, like Roeland.<eos> Will you?
I said only till I turned 18!<eos> The way he ran...<eos> Good! Otherwise I would have to beat him up.<eos> Your folks hate me... and now you're leaving.<eos> - What am I going to do?<eos> - Help dad with his presentation!<eos> You'll become friends.<eos> I offered.<eos> - He threw me out of the car.<eos> - This time he won't.
Your father's name is Ravindra.<eos> He used to work in Texas.<eos> not Krishna Murthy.<eos> I'l listen whatever the stories you tell.<eos> Coz in there is my parents in every stories.<eos> You'd killed him in every story.<eos> The end of story is always same that I'll kill you.<eos> You won't kill me.<eos> If you wanted then you'll shot here and not in other places.<eos> You won't me.
Everyone takes a taxi or the subway.<eos> So do you live in a nice building?<eos> I like it.<eos> - We have a game room.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - A hot tub on the roof. - Oh wow.<eos> I would love to see that.<eos> When you get better, you should come visit.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I will.
Bank of Loup, up near Wamego.<eos> How long since you've been there, Sir?<eos> Five... six weeks.<eos> Bank of Loup went bust.<eos> Happens all the time to sod-buster banks in the Territory.<eos> I've lost more than my fair share of this wild-cat paper.<eos> You have any greenbacks?<eos> No, I spent it all.<eos> I'm sorry, Sir, I cannot accept these banknotes.<eos> Nobody around here will.
Woo-hoo!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I will talk to Johnathan in the morning.<eos> No. No.<eos> No, this time you're gonna do something.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You let her run all over you, and now her boy too.<eos> Why don't you do something?<eos> They're your family too.<eos> All right, I will.
Yes, sir.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Set, boys?<eos> Move fast.<eos> Get him to that base.<eos> Don't come back till daylight.<eos> Listen, you're gonna be two men down.<eos> What if they attack again?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> They won't.
Look at this dump.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> Looks like I'm still in grad school.<eos> Well, did you already find a place?<eos> Yeah. It's great.<eos> And they'll let me move in on the 15th.<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> It's like a half-hour away.<eos> We're not going to see each other again.<eos> Of course we will.
The Ancient Ones said that Jauja was a mythological land of abundance and happiness.<eos> Many expeditions tried to find the place to verify this.<eos> With time, the legend grew disproportionately. People were undoubtedly exaggerating, as they usually do.<eos> The only thing that is known for certain is that all who tried to find this earthly paradise got lost on the way.<eos> Father, why can't I have a dog of my own?<eos> You will, Inge.
Hang on. Yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, not so good, actually. We just heard about stoke.<eos> Um, what the fuck?<eos> No, that is absolutely unacceptable.<eos> He's supposed to be here, shooting a scene right now.<eos> Oh, please, it's a Michael Bay movie.<eos> His part could be played by a can opener.<eos> Oh, believe me... we will sue you.<eos> Oh, yes, we will. Mnh.

When the show's on is irrelevant.<eos> You don't go, "when's that YouTube video on?"<eos> It's just on.<eos> So, forget the when.<eos> Forget "nights" and "time slots" and "lead-ins."<eos> So, how are people supposed to know when...<eos> Forget the when!<eos> What... what when?<eos> What I mean is, how will they know what's on?<eos> They won't.
- Like when you got crabs.<eos> Thanks for reminding me.<eos> Or that guy in Rio who gave you the black eye.<eos> That crazy motherfucker was trying to rob me!<eos> To all the crazy motherfuckers.<eos> All the crazy motherfuckers.<eos> - George.<eos> - What?<eos> Remember we used to go to Castelli and Mary Boone... and you would say... one day we'll go there to see my one-man show?<eos> And we will.
We're meddling with things that we're only beginning to understand.<eos> Have you ever seen a Chinese M99 sniper rifle?<eos> This is the finest-made weapon in the world... pinpoint accuracy.<eos> What are you planning on doing with that thing?<eos> Did you sabotage us, doctor? No!<eos> Like I said, she could still wake up.<eos> You need to give her more time.<eos> You will replace this chip with the one that works.<eos> You don't have that chip.<eos> I will shortly.
I've been meaning to ask you.<eos> Our mutual friend, she put guards at your door, tried to protect you.<eos> Yet you left anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> You really have to ask?<eos> How did you feel when she threw you aside?<eos> When she's ready, get her on a boat.<eos> Captain, this isn't what I meant by cleaning up.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
The eye make-up is wrong. Your walk, too.<eos> Everything.<eos> It's all wrong.<eos> Did you at least learn by heart?<eos> I have to go out.<eos> No, no...<eos> I must.<eos> You can't.<eos> If you go and someone recognises you, it was all in vain.<eos> No one will.
No, of course you're not.<eos> Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock.<eos> Pray silence for the best man.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends, and... um, others.<eos> A- also...<eos> Greg... Molly.<eos> I've just had a thought.<eos> Is that a brain?<eos> What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man?<eos> Well, he will, won't he?
That's... not Lady Smallwood, Mr Holmes.<eos> Is John with you?<eos> He's, um...<eos> Is John here?<eos> He's downstairs.<eos> So, what do you do now?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step, I swear I will kill you.<eos> No, Mrs Watson... you won't.
Okay, so we had a normal sex life.<eos> Then one day, out of the blue...<eos> Put a finger in my ass.<eos> You know, I'd never done that before.<eos> I didn't want to do it.<eos> Like, this was not my thing, and luckily, no one had ever asked me before, so it never really came up.<eos> But he asked me.<eos> And then my grandmamma popped into my brain.<eos> Whatever he wants you to do you better do it.<eos> Or some other bitch will.
Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.<eos> What the fuck did you do?<eos> Spend enough time on an island, begin to forget there's a whole world out there.<eos> A world where the rules are different.<eos> I went out there, found men who don't know the rules here and who don't much care to learn them.<eos> They helped me surprise Captain Hornigold's men, we took his fort, and not once were any of them burdened with the thought, "What if this were to upset Eleanor Guthrie?"<eos> Well, they're about to learn the rules, Charles.<eos> The hard way.<eos> You think I'm gonna let this stand?<eos> That Hornigold will?
It can send you to the hospital if you're not careful.<eos> I'll teach you how to use this thing.<eos> But a chef's knife, it belongs to the chef, not to the kitchen.<eos> So it's your responsibility to keep it sharp, clean, not to lose it.<eos> - Can you handle that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is a good knife.<eos> It'll last you a long time if you take care of it.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
So I need to take him.<eos> You're one of those people who can will himself to do things.<eos> I go to school with a lot of kids like that.<eos> I'm not one of those kids.<eos> Today, you are.<eos> I got a deal for ya.<eos> Give me the kid and I'll let you live.<eos> Or I come in there, kill you and take the kid anyway.<eos> - Don't let him take me.<eos> - I won't.
Not prove that he's incapable of giving it.<eos> I was no harder on him than any member of parliament would be.<eos> You humiliated him in front of me.<eos> It was like you were punishing the both of us for-for-for disagreeing with you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He says he can do it.<eos> Or is that his disease affecting his judgment?<eos> Look, even if your father wasn't in a... compromised state, it would be a fool's errand to try to convince parliament to extend that lease.<eos> He has staked his entire administration on getting this done.<eos> And he will, but not here.
"WestWingMan.net"?<eos> Never heard of this.<eos> Come on, man. You're embarrassing yourself.<eos> That's the hottest gossip site in DC.<eos> Yeah? "Lifting the lid on the Inter-agency Softball League"?<eos> "Face to Face with America's Wind Tycoons." Wow.<eos> This is some seriously butter knife-dull shit, man.<eos> No, no, no. Underneath, that's grit legit.<eos> So what's WestWingMan got on the Maddox thing?<eos> Nothing yet. But he will.
Well... after he came on, I did this trick.<eos> Right, you know that... that drag-back thing that Johan Cruyff did?<eos> Well, I made a bit of a mess of it, actually, but it sort of worked and it made him look stupid.<eos> Players like Trent think that's taking the mickey.<eos> There's no call for skill like that in his book.<eos> He got angry and he started intimidating you?<eos> I know what you're saying.<eos> "Tell the jury that you were scared of Trent, "and it will help self-defence stand up better in court."<eos> Dean Trent... doesn't scare me.<eos> Prison will.
How long has child been missing?<eos> Many people come in and out of P.O.R.<eos> - Buffet very popular.<eos> - Sure. Is there an actual Vladimir, and if so, may we speak with him?<eos> Vlad very busy.<eos> He's meeting with his 10:00 now.<eos> No! No! No!<eos> He has very long day ahead.<eos> - We'll wait.<eos> - No, we won't.
Why climb a mountain if you don't have the balls?<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> What will you do?<eos> Eat me?<eos> You're scared shitless.<eos> Pair of eunuchs!<eos> Bhaati!<eos> You shouldn't have said that<eos> I won't forget this<eos> No, I won't, Bhaati
We've got really good music there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The House sent a bill to the Senate.<eos> What Frank wants to send back bears zero resemblance.<eos> Because it's bipartisan, unlike ours.<eos> That sounds like something Frank would say.<eos> - I'm not Frank.<eos> - He has a desk in your office.<eos> - If this bill passes in the Senate...<eos> - It won't.
Man, he didn't want you to know.<eos> He knew how disappointed you'd be.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Come on.<eos> Where we going?<eos> To see your friends.<eos> Wait, wait. No.<eos> No, I can't, man.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> Uh, no, they won't.
- She has nothing to be ashamed of. - Exactly.<eos> - Where is she? - ls she OK?<eos> She's still at the Vita Gala.<eos> Claude is handling it.<eos> - Go to her, Alain.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> She won't be long. She might even be on her way.<eos> We're stopping.<eos> We have no choice but to stop. We'll get caught.<eos> We won't.
Nessa, look at me.<eos> Nessa.<eos> We must be very, very careful now.<eos> Tell no-one.<eos> Rachel and Ephra already know. About this?<eos> What happened to us.<eos> Oh, not everything.<eos> They know enough.<eos> If they go to the police...<eos> They won't.
I'd just come through the window.<eos> What?<eos> You know what.<eos> We said it had to be the big one.<eos> 10 million in loose stones, that's pretty big.<eos> No one's ever stolen from Rabbit before and lived.<eos> We could do this.<eos> - He'll kill you.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> He won't.
I'll get help.<eos> Maester Aemon is coming.<eos> He's gonna make it all right.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Now!<eos> The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
Mommy!<eos> Oh, mom. Sorry.<eos> We were just goofing around.<eos> He was trying to get the twins to eat.<eos> Oh, kids, what did I tell you?<eos> I just, um...<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> It's not their fault.<eos> They didn't properly understand.<eos> They will.
And furious.<eos> I was lashing out at all the wrong people.<eos> And a friend of mine suggested that I come here.<eos> To throw plates against a wall?<eos> You'd be surprised how good it feels.<eos> 'Kay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> I don't see how this will change the fact that Caleb's gone.<eos> It won't.
If you are asking if I am disposed to a French alliance, yes... with the right suitor.<eos> But I value my darling Charlotte highly, Cardinal.<eos> Very highly indeed.<eos> I'm certain we can find someone worthy of her.<eos> Charlotte... You and your father will ride with me.<eos> They're still following us?<eos> Yes, and they're not tiring.<eos> Determined.<eos> What if we can't lose them?<eos> We will.
- Sure?<eos> - Positive.<eos> In that case, where were we?<eos> Logan's not answering.<eos> I don't want to text him with this, I'll just try later.<eos> - Jeremy...<eos> - Shh.<eos> We can talk later, Antonio.<eos> You have to stop them.<eos> We will.
Someone help me. Help me.<eos> It's locked. It's locked, it's locked, it's locked.<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> And he's told you what to do.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> This is not what God wants.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> Open your eyes and wash the sins out.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't!
Wait here.<eos> - Where's Jane?<eos> - Interrogation room with a pedophile who lives near the park.<eos> Okay, uh, can you tell her to come down to autopsy<eos> - when she's done?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - It can never happen again.<eos> - And it won't.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I... I... she just called me, and, uh, she said that she's getting off in a bit so I...<eos> - But, well... - I-if it's convenient.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's get it over with.<eos> All right, I have no idea how you are going to take this, but I need you to keep an open mind.<eos> When I have ever not been open-minded?<eos> And you cannot tell Sharon, either.<eos> I won't, okay?
And if I was to tell you that sometimes what seems like an ending turns out to be...<eos> Mom?<eos> I'm not... I'm not ready to hear this.<eos> When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never. But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will.
Fine, OK, I won't.<eos> Because if you do, someone's gonna get hurt.<eos> "Jenna and Toby?"<eos> Melissa, you were the one who wanted to take a break.<eos> I've just been killing time.<eos> Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Please look, I'll do anything, OK.<eos> I'll get down on my hands and knees.<eos> I'll beg you if that's what you want me to.<eos> - Please!<eos> - Stop.<eos> Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
- 'Cause Kopus is smart. - Mmm.<eos> Robbing an old folks' home is smart how?<eos> It's not that big a deal-- it's insured.<eos> Nobody got hurt.<eos> Were you scared?<eos> A little, at first.<eos> Then it's like, I got super focused.<eos> Should've taken the SATs right after.<eos> - If my dad ever found out--<eos> - He won't.
Does this look like romance?<eos> No. That looks infected.<eos> After some soul-searching,<eos> George and I came to the same conclusion...<eos> Maybe drawing some boundaries wasn't a bad idea after all.<eos> Tessa...<eos> I'm so sorry about the other night.<eos> That kind of thing will never happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
I do.<eos> I see no reason to put chablis within reach of an alcoholic.<eos> So I'm forced to stare at that... chunk of sludge three days a week?<eos> She is here to clean.<eos> It doesn't matter what she looks like.<eos> Remember?<eos> Forgive me. Old habits.<eos> The last few months have been rapturous, Adrian.<eos> Now that we're home, don't ruin it.<eos> I won't.
Go ahead.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Roman's had it forever.<eos> Did he say where he got it?<eos> It's been so long, I don't know if he even remembers.<eos> - Roman!<eos> - You invited them here after I told you not to?<eos> What if mom finds out?<eos> - She won't!
It was more like a spiritual guidance, type thing.<eos> The only difference was that he had a degree.<eos> I could put you in touch.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> Just a suggestion.<eos> Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
- Richie.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - This is Richie. Hi, Richie. This is my boyfriend Jon.<eos> Hey. So, um, are you in video games too?<eos> Uh, no, I cut hair, actually.<eos> Oh, right, like for a living?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, for now. But eventually you'll wanna, you know...<eos> Get your own place or something, right?<eos> I will?
So where exactly do you think you'll be living?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Move in with your little girlfriend?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> As usual.<eos> Just like your father, you have no plan.<eos> Just flying by the seat of your pants.<eos> Well, that isn't gonna work for me.<eos> Come Sunday, you are getting on a plane and going back to your dad.<eos> I will not.
I need to find her to get you back.<eos> Ok, I'll come with you.<eos> It's really intense what I have to do.<eos> It's more intense than the fact that your sister lives with wolves and a guy who eats guys.<eos> Ok. Do you guys mind staying with him while I'm gone?<eos> He likes home-improvement shows and movies about getting stoned.<eos> - Actually, I have an appointment.<eos> - Ok. Thanks for coming through.<eos> - No, we'll be with him.<eos> - Yeah, of course we will.
It's not possible.<eos> - Ethan couldn't kill someone.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> 'Cause if he was involved and the police find out, well, he's not the only one who will be arrested here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean you drove him here, I stitched him up.<eos> That makes us accomplices after the fact.<eos> But we're not sure he did this.<eos> That's why you need to wake up your boyfriend and get him to tell you the truth.<eos> What if he won't?
As soon as this was over I would have told you everything.<eos> So what would you have told me?<eos> 'Sorry I chained you to a bed like some SM whore.' 'And that I ogled your pussy with some retard.'<eos> We'll be rich.<eos> Very rich.<eos> How rich?<eos> Four million.<eos> He's going to pay four million for you.<eos> My dad? Four million for me?<eos> He won't. - He will.
I thought he was dead.<eos> Well, he's come back to life.<eos> What are his paintings worth?<eos> Depends on size.<eos> And artistic merit, presumably.<eos> Not really, just size. (Mobile phone rings)<eos> He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.<eos> What's he done with all of it?<eos> Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you.<eos> No, I won't.
No, why?<eos> You having another rally?<eos> No.<eos> I would like to have dinner with you.<eos> Would you like to have dinner with me, Max?<eos> Yeah, sure, yeah.<eos> Got a pen?<eos> Here's my number.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Something's...<eos> Something's making me act like this. This isn't me.<eos> I don't know, maybe... maybe they could do, like, an autopsy on my brain after I die.<eos> What makes you think you're going to die?<eos> I deserve to die for what I did.<eos> I believe you are having a medical emergency.<eos> I'm going to call an ambulance to take you...<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Then you won't.
You ready to Rock n' Roll? Uh...<eos> Barbara, I'm beat.<eos> Do we really have to go to this thing?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> So? Talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.
As yours.<eos> To be the perfect host.<eos> Go easy with that.<eos> Don't fret, Mother.<eos> To us.<eos> Ah, Miss Adams, more than punctual.<eos> I wanted a moment alone.<eos> Today is obviously designed to see me out of my depth.<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll make of it whatever your social skills will allow.<eos> I will.
You never asked my position.<eos> You assumed.<eos> I can't imagine what that position must be.<eos> I've served in war zones. I know first-hand how important chain of command...<eos> We're not talking about war zones. We're talking about sexual assault.<eos> How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...<eos> We don't need more studies. We need reform.<eos> Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.<eos> I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Good. Nice.<eos> - Yeah? You think she'll like it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You're footing the bill.<eos> - I know. - No. Even if she offers to split it.<eos> - Even if she offers to split it, I will pay the bill.<eos> - Hundred percent?<eos> - Hundred percent and 20% percent gratuity.<eos> - Will you go do some police work, please?<eos> - Maybe I will.
- When?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He said to just be ready.<eos> I gotta reprove myself to him.<eos> You're staying with me now.<eos> I'll take you to my place.<eos> - I don't need a place to crash.<eos> I need to get out.<eos> You said you'd do that for me.<eos> - And I will.
The one in Lexington?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Guess I can do a little poking around, see what I can find.<eos> Well, I'd appreciate it.<eos> All right.<eos> You got it.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you think she'll be okay?<eos> Until she screws up again.<eos> Well, maybe she won't.
I tried to think what you would do if you were here.<eos> So I just emptied my clip into the ceiling and I hoped for the best.<eos> That's unreal.<eos> Kind of like asking those guys to hold off saving the world while you go look for your wife?<eos> I'm a persuasive guy. Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> 30m! -<eos> This is the only picture I have of you.<eos> You don't need a picture of me.<eos> You never will again.
You think I lost my right?<eos> How about this?<eos> Why don't we tell her the truth and see who she choose?<eos> Don't you dare do that to her.<eos> She old enough now.<eos> You ain't telling' her nothin' and then walk out and leave her.<eos> You wanna tell her? Fine.<eos> You go on and tell her.<eos> But then you got to take her.<eos> Well, maybe I will.
Just by bringing us here, my brother and I are already dead.<eos> We're just about the only people who can help you now.<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> You people are amateurs compared to him.<eos> Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Okay.<eos> We didn't find your sister.<eos> There was another truck.<eos> She may have been on that.<eos> So someone saw her at the house?<eos> Maybe.<eos> We can't be sure.<eos> But you will find her and catch whoever's left, right?<eos> You'll punish them for what they've done?<eos> We will.
Okay, here we go.<eos> - You good?<eos> - I will be in 90 seconds.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's Madeline Pratt's SIM card.<eos> I swiped it when I palmed her phone.<eos> If I'm gonna do this, I want to know who she talks to and why.<eos> You know how to palm a phone?<eos> - How will you return his badge?<eos> - I won't.
They all fell in line with it though, didn't they?<eos> We just wanted to put it all behind us.<eos> Can anybody vouch for you at the benefit on Saturday night?<eos> Every trawlerman that wasn't out at sea.<eos> We had a lock-in till two.<eos> She was there an' all.<eos> I left around eleven.<eos> Went home. Early start.<eos> OK. Now, if Lee Stonnall shows his face again...<eos> He won't.
I.D., please.<eos> Please, lieutenant shumway, I'm begging you, she needs to leave.<eos> As a fellow guardsman... Just let us walk out of here And I'll do anything you want.<eos> You're not a guardsman yet, cadet.<eos> I.D. Now.<eos> Stop her.<eos> How long are we supposed to wait?<eos> Will this even work?<eos> We'll find out.<eos> No, we won't.
I need you!<eos> You want to win this election, and you can't do that if I...<eos> You are not resigning.<eos> I won't win without you.<eos> I'm not resigning.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> [Door creaks] Put that away.<eos> You look ridiculous.<eos> I don't want to use this. But I will.<eos> No, you won't.
I'm outside your door. - What?<eos> I'm standing outside your door.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean I'm drunk, and I'm... standing outside of your door.<eos> I'm not letting you in.<eos> - Liv.<eos> - You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.
I'm standing outside your door.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean I'm drunk, and I'm... standing outside of your door.<eos> I'm not letting you in.<eos> - Liv.<eos> - You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.<eos> No, I won't.
Safer to stay here until we understand the threat.<eos> Secret Service will designate this "the castle." It becomes the president's location in an attack.<eos> This is the last position to fall.<eos> Finley, I think we do understand the threat.<eos> This has to be Gibson.<eos> Generator is up. We have power.<eos> How long will we be blind?<eos> A day.<eos> We'll have no communications. We'll have no access to surveillance systems.<eos> But neither will our enemies.
Bulk it up.<eos> I need you to take down this bag of chips.<eos> What the hell are you gonna do next?<eos> You gonna put a scorpion in my lunchbox?<eos> You carry a lunchbox?<eos> What? Are you 6?<eos> I promise you, there's a point to all of this.<eos> What?<eos> How does George eating a bag of chips help him make the team?<eos> It won't.
Then in the aftermath, Ronnie must have figured out the family secret.<eos> He's a Dorchester.<eos> - This isn't a heist, Gus.<eos> - This is an assassination.<eos> Actually... it's a heist gone wrong.<eos> You two got killed trying to escape.<eos> He killed you with this.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That did not happen.<eos> No. But it will.
Then it's on.<eos> [Laughing] You actually think that's gonna work?<eos> [Scoffs] It's not my first time in ninth grade.<eos> Call me old-fashioned, but I'm actually bringing a proper date.<eos> - Who?<eos> - My cousin.<eos> We don't need to tell you why that's a bad idea, right?<eos> You know.<eos> Nobody knows she's my cousin.<eos> Your penis will.
Can I call you back?<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Please?<eos> I just heard about your mom.<eos> God, Livie, why are the cops in this town working overtime to...<eos> Where have you been?<eos> You won't believe me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I probably won't.
Get out of here!<eos> You wanna get bounced back to juvie?<eos> Hey, where have you been?<eos> - Um, sorry, I...<eos> - Got lost looking for the bathrooms.<eos> You know you're not supposed to separate from the group.<eos> Yeah, I know, it's my fault. Um...<eos> I just didn't want to interrupt the tour.<eos> Sorry. It won't happen again.<eos> Yeah. It won't.
So cruel.<eos> I hate you!<eos> But I love you.<eos> The Valkyrie hair, the seed?<eos> What will make you love me? !<eos> Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!<eos> And you, I will get her everything she wanted.<eos> I will be everything she wanted.<eos> - And you, you're gonna help me.<eos> - I won't.
But you and I, we know the truth.<eos> Yeah? What's that?<eos> That you don't give a shit about anybody but yourself. Yep.<eos> I'm out here risking my life because I enjoy the scenery.<eos> You're doing this for Anana?<eos> Because you care?<eos> What does it matter why I do this?<eos> Because you're gonna hurt her.<eos> Maybe not tomorrow.<eos> But you will.
Including the Majority Whip, Jackie Sharp.<eos> Which is egregious, since the Committee hasn't stopped hearing testimony, and nor has the special prosecutor completed her investigation.<eos> You vigorously defend the President, but there are reports that you've had a falling out.<eos> That you haven't spoken in weeks.<eos> That is simply not true.<eos> I've spoken to senior staff at the White House who say the President's worried you want to run against him in 2016.<eos> And just today, Linda Vasquez intimated that you...<eos> Look, I fully expect that the President will run in 2016, and I hope he's generous enough to invite me to be his running mate.<eos> Impeachment, conviction. Let's say it happens.<eos> It won't.
Oh. I just wish I could skip the part where I don't know the right thing to do and get to the part where I do.<eos> Me too.<eos> Water.<eos> My kingdom for a lobe, amigo.<eos> My kingdom for a lobe.<eos> I didn't expect to see you again.<eos> Do you know how many nights I laid awake, year after year... wondering where you were, if you ever thought about me?<eos> Did you... ever?<eos> No.<eos> I will now, though.
You said we were brothers. You said that.<eos> Is that how you did it?<eos> Is that how you pointed the gun at her?<eos> Yes.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Why don't you just kill me?<eos> To kill you now... would be a mercy.<eos> You cannot die until you have suffered... the same way that I have suffered.<eos> Till you have known complete despair.<eos> And you will.
Look, you need to drop this, ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Really. How is any of this fine?<eos> Look, you need to concentrate on you.<eos> Now listen, are you going to your meetings?<eos> It's where I talk about How my father's facing prison.<eos> Laurel...<eos> This will all blow over, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> No. It won't, dad.
We need to put them down.<eos> Lieutenant-- now!<eos> Listen to me, these guys, have you seen them?<eos> Huh?<eos> You seen these guys?<eos> They do not go down!<eos> We got to call in the National Guard.<eos> That's a call for the mayor.<eos> And he hasn't made that yet.<eos> And he won't.
Significant progress has been made in treating the Red Flu. Oh!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Do you think they really had a treatment? At Olympia?<eos> Remember when this whole thing started?<eos> People were hoarding apple cider vinegar. Then they told us to rush to the hot springs 'cause that's a sure-fire cure.<eos> And now it's Olympia, whatever that is.<eos> Somebody's got to be making progress somewhere.<eos> It's not true what you said...<eos> That no one would miss you.<eos> I will.
He donated a wing to the hospital.<eos> Your family has plenty of money.<eos> My father has plenty of money.<eos> I have to make my own way.<eos> So this is your idea of making your own way?<eos> You owe me $100,000.<eos> That's not including the car.<eos> You pay me by Friday, or everyone in East End will know what you did to your brother.<eos> And what if I decide to do the same to you?<eos> You won't.
So, I-I'll stay.<eos> I'll help you and Taylor - You have a chance to be free now.<eos> - No, Drake.<eos> - You need to take it.<eos> I can come and go, but you will always be trapped in the Sector, and you know I'm right.<eos> And when things calm down, I'll come find you in Eljida.<eos> But that's not gonna happen unless you leave tonight.<eos> You were so small when they took you from me.<eos> And now I... I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Don't make me ask, please.<eos> Jack?<eos> He is your father.<eos> And this new man is, what, some misguided attempt to make George jealous?<eos> I'll be appealing to a far more potent emotion than that.<eos> Regina's back.<eos> They say your husband's alive.<eos> You bring him home.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
And me you.<eos> There's enough there for your return flight and one back for your husband.<eos> There's something you need to hear and it must come from me.<eos> You've found a home here and you shouldn't lose it because we've lost each other.<eos> My heart would break even more if what we've had got in the way of your coming back.<eos> If it seems right, you bring him home.<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> If it's right, you have to.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Come on, let's give ourselves the grand tour.<eos> Whoa, I could live in here.<eos> Okay, you know, when you think about it, the concept of a bidet is, like, disgusting.<eos> Oh my God, there's Chanel in here.<eos> Okay, we're trying stuff on.<eos> We're starting a Tumblr page.<eos> - You can do the captions.<eos> - Dude, no.<eos> What if we ruin something?<eos> We won't.
Is that what you want?<eos> Is it?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Say it.<eos> I don't need to say it.<eos> I want you to tell me how much you want me to make you feel good.<eos> Do it.<eos> Beg me.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
I'm not sure we belong together.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> - You're crazy, you know that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We should both go in.<eos> - No.<eos> This is on me.<eos> Besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.<eos> - She won't forgive me.<eos> - She will.
Now we clean up.<eos> Yep, looks like a possible staph infection.<eos> Get me a culture stat and put the patient under contact precautions. Thanks.<eos> - Nick. - Ultralite Premium shaft.<eos> Turns your slice into a fade.<eos> Don't break it.<eos> - Thanks, Nick.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> - Don't break it.<eos> - I won't.
What?<eos> It was Pelant, Booth.<eos> Oh. Again?<eos> He had the evidence, all the bones, and then I was buried.<eos> It was a dream, right?<eos> He was laughing at me, Booth. What?<eos> He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.<eos> Pelant is dead, right?<eos> I will find the killer, Booth.<eos> I will.
With the queen's guard posted outside, I... had to get creative.<eos> Or maybe you're using this visit as an excuse to have purchased that jacket.<eos> You do remember me.<eos> Of course I do. I'm fully recovered.<eos> Mentally, anyway.<eos> How's Aiden handling everything?<eos> Poorly, but he's agreed not to retaliate against Daniel.<eos> What about you?<eos> How will Emily Thorne return with a vengeance this time?<eos> She won't.
You know nothing.<eos> You are the last of your people.<eos> Then we are the same, eh?<eos> All I want is Wirepa.<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.
- Why?<eos> I could live in Africa.<eos> You don't think I could live in Africa?<eos> That's not what I thi...<eos> It's not who you are!<eos> It's not who I am?<eos> You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.
I could live in Africa.<eos> You don't think I could live in Africa?<eos> That's not what I thi...<eos> It's not who you are!<eos> It's not who I am?<eos> You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We will.
- Woodhouse?<eos> - Mum. If I see this glass empty again, I will be very - unhappy.<eos> - Perish the<eos> - thought, mum. - Now, then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> All right, then I will.
Let's go!<eos> Hold him right there.<eos> Go ahead. Got his feet.<eos> - You got him?<eos> - I got his head.<eos> Set.<eos> Ready?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> You said the lawyer would call!<eos> Yeah, and he will.
Fourth grade progress reports know no master.<eos> Ha. Listen, I don't want to pile it on, but my parents are in town Sunday.<eos> - Donna... - I just thought things were going so well, why not?<eos> Things are going well. They are.<eos> - Yeah. - That's because I'm really good at this part, the beginnings of relationships, but eventually I always find a way to... destroy them.<eos> The past is the past, Wallace.<eos> Yeah, 10, 20 years ago, I'd have told myself that too, but I've seen the pain I've caused.<eos> Two marriages, a stepson who barely wants anything to do with me.<eos> I got a lot of baggage, Donna, and I can't put you through that.<eos> I won't.
I'll take the risk.<eos> This is my life, my risk.<eos> Once you get past the grief of Aylee's death, you'll see.<eos> Your mother was right, you are relentless.<eos> When it comes to us, yes.<eos> But I can't do this.<eos> I am begging you, please stop.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ever.<eos> Then I will.
No. You're gonna kill me, anyway.<eos> Don't expect my assistance in the matter.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Give me the map, wanker!<eos> I'm sorry you're not his favorite kitten anymore, Charlie, but that's none of my devising.<eos> So cut my throat.<eos> Leave me here to rot.<eos> I've been close to worse deaths.<eos> But do think he'll love you for it?<eos> In time, he will.
Officially, as partners.<eos> I want to catch this guy, and I can't do it without you.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Now I bee I owe you 1,000 push-ups.<eos> I don't care about the push-ups, Jake.<eos> I care that you didn't honor our pact.<eos> I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Because the thing is I thought I could come back to work and just pick up where I left off, but that's unfair to me.<eos> - Yeah, totally unfair, so...<eos> - What it boils down to is...<eos> - Right, right.<eos> Boil it. - I've been out of the game for a while, but like any great athlete, it's gonna take me a while to get those muscles back in shape again.<eos> Yeah, so get back out there, champ!<eos> Immediately. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna get an exclusive interview with Norwood, and I'm gonna find out where that money is.<eos> No need to know the process. Just dazzle me with the results.<eos> I will, 'cause from now on...
She just showed up at my work.<eos> Listen, I know...<eos> My track record isn't exactly stellar, and I don't deserve this opportunity, but I'd like to try.<eos> Try what?<eos> Be her dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Just tell her to call me, okay? And you call me.<eos> Call me tomorrow and tell me what's going on.<eos> Of course I will.
He was protecting himself.<eos> It's justified.<eos> Wake up, okay?<eos> He killed our uncle.<eos> He's been lying to all of us.<eos> - He's our dad!<eos> - Vic, you're an idiot.<eos> Enough! Enough! Enough.<eos> Listen, if there's one thing... the only thing... that I'm certain of it's that we have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this.<eos> Yeah, well, then maybe we won't.
He makes a good profit from my enslavement to the lords.<eos> And because of that, he lacks conviction to pass the trials.<eos> What trials?<eos> The ones you'll have to face in order to set me free.<eos> Am I evil?<eos> Who really deserves the iron fist of punishment...<eos> The slave or the masters?<eos> That's a sad story, but it ends the same way.<eos> - Killing me won't make a difference.<eos> - Sure it will.
Some little chore that you have to get through or some little scene that reminds you that life will go on after they're gone.<eos> I used to think of that as a weakness, like I was giving up.<eos> And what do you think now?<eos> It's survival.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the way we get through.<eos> I can't imagine my life without Charlie.<eos> I can see it.<eos> And it breaks my heart... but I'll survive.<eos> Of course you will.
Jar Jar! Jar Jar, please.<eos> Oh, Mesa sorry, Masterin Mace.<eos> I'm just worried about the Queenie.<eos> I understand your fears and I am trying to help you, but for now, keep your mind focused on the task at hand.<eos> That is the best way you can help your friend.<eos> Whysa you thinking they want Queenie so badly?<eos> As the spiritual leader of her people, the living Force inside the Queen must be very powerful.<eos> Whoever the Great Mother is, she wants that power.<eos> Well, wesa not let them have Queenie's Force.<eos> No, we will not.
I have more than I can use.<eos> I eat, and out it goes.<eos> Eat, and out it goes.<eos> Fix me up a direct exit.<eos> I'll eat and shit all at once.<eos> Now you've gone too far. I won't have that filth.<eos> It's time you left.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> - You won't take my kidney?<eos> - No sir, we won't.
Other than me and Killian.<eos> Hey, what about after you?<eos> I'm tracking a breakout who can kill.<eos> Maybe Ultra rebooted the project.<eos> What does your boss say?<eos> Jedikiah denies knowing anything about it.<eos> Which he would in any event.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So how will I know what I'm up against.<eos> You won't.
Hard to imagine what else it could be.<eos> Which implies somebody was controlling it.<eos> Okay, so why the gem?<eos> What does it do?<eos> Could be just ornamental.<eos> No, someone went to far too much trouble to try and get it for it to be ornamental.<eos> It's gotta do something, or be something.<eos> The question is what?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
The minute I saw it, I knew you had to have it.<eos> You like it?<eos> Mm-hmm. Good.<eos> Well, honey, I got a job.<eos> But we're supposed to be going to the movies.<eos> The movie starts in an hour.<eos> I'll be back in 30 minutes.<eos> Please be on time.<eos> I don't want to miss the previews.<eos> Sweetie, we won't.
Find out who owns it and find out where it is.<eos> Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.<eos> Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?<eos> Do you want undignified?<eos> Then wait till you see what I do to you.<eos> You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.<eos> Your mother paid for it with her life.<eos> So will you.
Yeah, we booked you for surgery on Wednesday, at which stage we're gonna make a-an incision over your chest and we're gonna pull that clavicle back into place.<eos> Yep, and then I'm going to harvest a tendon from your forearm, and Dr. Goran is going to use it to attach your clavicle back to the breastbone.<eos> How long will I be laid up?<eos> Uh, five or six months, approximately.<eos> I mean, yeah, it's a long rehabilitation process.<eos> Guys, we're selling the house.<eos> I-I won't have a place to live in a week.<eos> And you're gonna need some help with daily activities like showering, dressing, the whole deal.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> No. You won't.
Then tell me what you want.<eos> I told you I want Pyaari back.<eos> Shivani ji, you aren't listening to me.<eos> That girl has seen too much.<eos> I don't take such a risk in my business.<eos> It's too late now.<eos> Aunty, hurry up!<eos> Listen, kid.<eos> I'll come hunting to your house to rescue Pyaari.<eos> But rescue I will.
Use it for what?<eos> When you invoked the name of your love in a selfish plea for redemption,<eos> I was able to curse you... more specifically, your kiss.<eos> See, the next time your lips touch Emma Swan's, all of her magic will be taken.<eos> Everything that makes her special, that makes her powerful, that makes her a threat will be gone.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> And she'll defeat you.<eos> Then I'll send The Dark One to kill her before you can.<eos> No, you won't.
Otherwise, it'd be suicide to want you.<eos> We should follow Vincent while he follows the clues and back him up. It's too risky.<eos> If they're following him, then JT...<eos> Vincent, this isn't your fault. The hell it is, okay? !<eos> Everyone is here wasting their time because of me!<eos> Now JT- - JT is kidnapped!<eos> The man thinks he won a grant, for God's sake!<eos> You need to calm down and think this through.<eos> No, we need to save JT.<eos> And we will, together.
Knock-knock!<eos> Sookie, is that you?<eos> Yeah, I didn't wanna sneak up on you.<eos> - I brought Jessica with.<eos> Well, this shouldn't be weird at all.<eos> - Hey, Redbone. - Hey.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> - Did you see "Field of Dreams"?<eos> "If you build it, they will come."<eos> - Yes, they will.
- Well, some things are worth dying for.<eos> - Captain,<eos> - there's a right way to do this.<eos> - Yeah, and we can.<eos> Thanks to Cassius, we know where to find Matias.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - My DEA contacts spotted him two hours ago in this border town of Mexicali.<eos> We spoke to the D.A.'s office.<eos> They're just waiting for a judge to get his extradition papers.<eos> Well, they won't.
This is what you wanted, right?<eos> So let her go.<eos> You are gonna confess to murdering my daughter, and you're gonna point the finger at El Mozo for ordering you<eos> - to do it. - It won't bring her back.<eos> I want to hear you say you killed my daughter.<eos> Say it!<eos> I can't.<eos> Because I didn't do it.<eos> I will blow your head off.<eos> No, you won't.
Uh, he is alive.<eos> My uncle.<eos> I see him.<eos> I take him medicine. He's-He's very, very sick.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I had to tell you. I don't want to lie to you anymore.<eos> I don't want to lie to you either.<eos> It's a secret though.<eos> You can't- You can't write about it.<eos> But, Aayan- You can't tell anyone.<eos> Okay. I won't.
This is it. This... sacrifice.<eos> Snow, we have to do this.<eos> You have to do this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't crush your heart.<eos> I can't lose you. You could never lose me.<eos> But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother. Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
In self-defense.<eos> He was gonna hurt you.<eos> He wanted to hurt both of us.<eos> And I wanted to hurt him, too.<eos> I was so angry.<eos> And a part of me...<eos> I think in that moment a part of me just wanted him to die.<eos> Well, I don't blame you.<eos> I guess we'll see if other people feel the same way.<eos> They will.
You got 'em?<eos> You got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Take this now.<eos> More.<eos> It's okay if you choke.<eos> It's just a different route to the same thing.<eos> I really feel great.<eos> Jessa, don't you take any of these pills after I'm gone.<eos> No, I won't.
Jennifer Mills, you are under arrest.<eos> "Good people, bad luck"?<eos> I heard your mother say that once.<eos> You knew my mother?<eos> I'm sure you're aware that your responses obligate me to have you transferred to a psych ward.<eos> Excuse me, I'm Henry Parish.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Captain Irving's attorney.<eos> My wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
The question is...<eos> Who am I?<eos> Right.<eos> I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess The identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones<eos> Will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
I'm gonna fight, stay underground.<eos> When I see you again, I hope it's in a better world.<eos> It's the shofar.<eos> The trumpet that made The israelites tremble at mount sinai.<eos> That brought down the walls of jericho.<eos> That has signaled the starting of wars For aeons.<eos> And now is to sound the moment That moloch has grown to his full glory, To call his servants to his side.<eos> It's nice to see that you've taken up an instrument.<eos> Perhaps after dinner tonight, we can have a recital.<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.
Especially a man facing life in a hellhole like this.<eos> An injunction against all involuntary treatments.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I would like to speak to my client in private.<eos> These won't be necessary anymore.<eos> Cynthia told me she was getting a new lawyer, but I thought it would take a while to process.<eos> There's always a way to expedite things.<eos> You'll find that I can be very persuasive.<eos> What else have you heard about me?<eos> Only that my wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
I mean, it will fill that hole inside you, sure, for the moment.<eos> But then, it will begin to eat away at who you are until there is so much emptiness that nothing, no one, will ever be able to fill you back up.<eos> That happened to you, didn't it?<eos> Yes, Kenny, it did.<eos> It took me the better part of this century to crawl my way out of it.<eos> I guess we are kind of similar.<eos> We're very loyal to the people that we actually care about.<eos> You're my son.<eos> And we'll see each other again.<eos> We will.
It's looking like that's all I got left, you know?<eos> Some kind of insanity plea.<eos> I just don't want to spend the rest of my life in a cage.<eos> It's not about what you want.<eos> You gave that up when you walked in here.<eos> I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> There are gonna be consequences, obviously, but if you choose to live, man, there's... you can make something out of that life.<eos> What if I don't?<eos> Don't you do that.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Counting the last night's surprise attack, I believe... about three times.<eos> I wonder who is this new officer that is keeping you waiting?<eos> Someone quintessential to this battle, I'm told.<eos> Apparently, there is no one better to bring down Yi Sun-Shin than him.<eos> Byuk-Pa Port, Admiral's Fleet.<eos> Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be beneficial for you to dissmis your men and join forces with army.<eos> - Father!<eos> - What is he doing with his sword out?<eos> I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!<eos> Of course they will!
Do you really think I'm coming back to Brenham, Texas?<eos> I got my ticket out of this place, Luke.<eos> Soon as I'm pregnant, I am going to be one of the most famous people on the planet.<eos> Wow. Well, doesn't mean you couldn't come back here, right?<eos> I mean, look, I know I don't say this too much, but you and me... We're a pretty good couple.<eos> Yeah, but there's a big world out there.<eos> I want to see it, you know?<eos> I want to be part of it.<eos> Mm. What if you lose?<eos> I won't.
Hello? Hey. Elvis isn't doing too well.<eos> How are his eyes?<eos> Are they open?<eos> Yes, but he... he's having a hard time seeing.<eos> Some things are blurry.<eos> He needs water...<eos> As much as you can give him.<eos> He's not responding.<eos> I need to call an ambulance.<eos> - No, you won't.
Anyone with information on this is asked to contact their local authorities.<eos> Of course, you can keep it right here for the very latest on this breaking news story.<eos> No mask?<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation.<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the coroner will confirm?<eos> Yes, he will.
I'm fine.<eos> Gonna, um, go book an O.R., though.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> The best thing you can do for this kid is to be nowhere near him.<eos> Because you look horrible.<eos> Yeah, I can drain a potts puffy tumor.<eos> - Go home. - Yeah, you should go home.<eos> - You need to... - I'm fine.<eos> Okay? I can take care of myself.<eos> Maybe I will.
She also built grenades.<eos> It's not many.<eos> Again, thank you, Murphy.<eos> We'll make them count.<eos> If the grounders make it through the front gate, guns and grenades should force them back.<eos> And then?<eos> Then we close the door and pray.<eos> And pray what?<eos> That the ship keeps them out?<eos> Because it won't.
Fine.<eos> If you won't let me save you, how about we save everybody else?<eos> You're the only one who can fire those rockets.<eos> If you die, we all die.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Finn, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Clarke, I need to do this.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
That's how I got out in time.<eos> I knew they were still inside.<eos> But I just kept running.<eos> And I kept going until I couldn't hear them screaming any more.<eos> I was the oldest.<eos> They were screaming for me.<eos> You were only a child.<eos> After that day, I swore that I would never love anyone ever again.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
Everyone says you've got to bribe someone.<eos> So don't listen.<eos> You're not a kid, Dima.<eos> It's worth a try at least.<eos> Or should I drop everything and go borrow some money?<eos> Why do you need this anyway?<eos> Well, I could take over Fedotov's position.<eos> You'd need to be buddies with everyone, and to them you're just some student.<eos> They'll say you're trying to be smart.<eos> They certainly will.
It's hard to imagine you and Donna ever being my age.<eos> I got it for her.<eos> What, the decoder ring?<eos> Yeah, last week.<eos> I knew we were gonna nail it at COMDEX and sell the Giant.<eos> So I had the same jeweler in Berkeley make one up and send it out to the office.<eos> It's hidden in my garage right now.<eos> I'm gonna give it to her when I get back next week.<eos> I hope we sell the Giant.<eos> We will.
Make the day go easy.<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> Yo, Carl. We taking all them to school too?<eos> No, back to the parking lot where they live.<eos> What, they live in a parking lot?<eos> Van, but it's in a parking lot.<eos> What are we gonna do with Chuckie?<eos> I have to take him back to the hospital to see his mom and Frank.<eos> We're not all gonna fit.<eos> Sure we will.
Woe betide the man that stands between you and what you set your mind upon.<eos> And damned if that stubbornness, isn't what I find so attractive about you.<eos> All aboard!<eos> All aboard!<eos> As they say, that's my cue.<eos> This is backwards.<eos> I should be the one leaving for the front lines.<eos> Welcome to the 20th century.<eos> Please, don't take any unnecessary risks.<eos> - I won't.
All aboard!<eos> As they say, that's my cue.<eos> This is backwards.<eos> I should be the one leaving for the front lines.<eos> Welcome to the 20th century.<eos> Please, don't take any unnecessary risks.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Claire Beauchamp Randall, promise that you'll return to me.<eos> I will, Frank Randall.
I have no idea.<eos> I want to be above James Blunt.<eos> James Blunt was 1.49.4.<eos> That is FW, which stands for flipping wet.<eos> So you are definitely going to the above him.<eos> So come on, be reasonable.<eos> I mean, I would like to be towards the top, but...<eos> That is the 1.45 region. Yeah. I mean, I don't know...<eos> Do you know, I was just about to say,<eos> "Well, Jesse Pinkman..." But I won't.
I lose all control and go on a murder spree like the last person who put on the shoes.<eos> And the only way to stop me is to... that's code for slit my throat.<eos> Very clear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm assuming that's what happened to the woman from Dyson's past your subconscious depicted as me.<eos> You sang in French, you know?<eos> Was I any good?<eos> A plus.<eos> Lauren, I don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> You won't.
Why? Apparently, after they broke up, his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things, and he wants 'em back.<eos> And he needs the garage door opener to get into her place?<eos> Her mom's place, but, yeah.<eos> But given his record, why doesn't he just steal it himself?<eos> Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar, and he can't get close to it without someone spotting him and then telling her.<eos> And you're actually thinking about doing this?<eos> If I don't, he won't sign.<eos> Castle, he could drag this on for years.<eos> And if you get caught?<eos> I won't.
Carl, you're destroying it.<eos> You're destroying it, Carl!<eos> Carl!<eos> - Carl!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> - It has to be here!<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - No, it's not okay!<eos> He can't beat us, not again.<eos> He won't.
We need to find Lauryn. She could break this case open.<eos> Do you need another minute?<eos> No.<eos> Sheila...<eos> I know this wasn't easy. Call me, anytime.<eos> I can help with the grieving process.<eos> Thanks, but I won't be needing this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You may, change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Have you said something to her?<eos> - No.<eos> - We already said no.<eos> I know that, but I think it would show that we trust her.<eos> I won't let her be indoctrinated by the church.<eos> They get them when they're young.<eos> It's what they do. You know it's what they do.<eos> I just don't want to crush her spirit.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
Now I don't know what it is.<eos> It's the Darkness.<eos> Whatever it is, I won't rest until it's dead.<eos> You can't fight it.<eos> Maybe not alone, but I know where I can go for help.<eos> I was reminded of what being married could be like, and I realized I owe you an apology.<eos> I was unfeeling to you earlier because I was afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of what might happen if Francis finds out.<eos> He won't.
- Huh? - I only ran to keep up with appearances.<eos> The fake punches were a great touch, though.<eos> Those were real punches.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I like you.<eos> Uh, Sampson, we need your login info to access the Phoenician Exchange Web site.<eos> Already have a Tor browser installed.<eos> Said I'm up for anything, but that-- that's bad for business.<eos> It could trace back to me.<eos> It won't.
Hardly any pictures.<eos> We hear you like photography.<eos> You take a lot of pictures of the boys in your group?<eos> I pity you, Seeing depravity in perfectly normal behavior.<eos> If you have an accusation Or any real evidence, Let's hear it.<eos> Otherwise, I've got work to do.<eos> That was quick.<eos> Yeah, I left my cell.<eos> You manage to get an answer out of carver On the combustible boat?<eos> No, not yet, but I will.
Well, that was quite a feast.<eos> Oh, that?<eos> Well, that's what we eat when we don't care what people think.<eos> Hmm. It is beautiful out here.<eos> Mmm, and it all belongs to me... And whomever I marry.<eos> Well, just the other day I was saying to my husband...<eos> Oh, did I say husband?<eos> I meant, father.<eos> I don't have a husband.<eos> Perhaps I will someday.
It's really just a pro forma hearing, Agent Booth.<eos> You have the support of the bureau, myself, my party, and your record is exemplary. Thank you, Congressman.<eos> It was difficult to pry Booth out of the field.<eos> Which is why he is the nominee.<eos> I can't tell you the number of positions that are filled by bureaucrats who have no real experience on the ground.<eos> Oh, the military taught me that you can't make the right decision without seeing the situation up close. Thank you.<eos> I am surprised that you're letting this one get away, Victor.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> Of course the opposition's gonna try and put you through the ringer, but don't you worry-- it's just a show. I have your records.<eos> I'll...
If you weren't working here, they wouldn't be able to use your relationship with Harvey as leverage.<eos> You think I would turn my back on him even if I wasn't working here?<eos> I don't think you'd ever turn your back on Harvey. That's the problem.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Harvey wanted you to stay.<eos> I wanted you to leave.<eos> You chose to stay. So your priorities, they seem pretty clear to me.<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> - Hey, wait a minute if they charge you with something, they're gonna go through your records, and they are going to realize that you're not a member of the bar.<eos> No, they won't.
Love you, too.<eos> Oh, god, no.<eos> No.<eos> Aah! Now you make the vx.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't do it.<eos> I won't do it, do you hear me?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I won't make your weapon.<eos> I won't.
You can't begrudge a bloke a few fond memories.<eos> No...<eos> I'm not having it.<eos> Amir...<eos> - What am I doing?<eos> - It's enough now.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You said you'd say something.<eos> Say something.<eos> Fine, I will.
At 60, it, uh, becomes voluntary, but I intend to stay if they will let me.<eos> Well, it's not voluntary yet, and I hate to be the one to bring this up, but we got squeezed on our schedule today, so, uh, if we're gonna get you back on time...<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> You're busy.<eos> Um, let me just say as I've said to Rusty how... [Sighs] Sorry I am to have, uh, left my little boy on his own and, uh, for you all to take care of.<eos> And I wish I had behaved better, and I hope that I...<eos> I hope that you all will let me prove that to you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course we will.
- Man: Hurry up!<eos> - He's going into shock!<eos> I'm coming, I'm coming.<eos> - We're losing him.<eos> - Do something.<eos> - I can't stop the bleeding.<eos> - Here, take out the branch!<eos> Can't take out the branch.<eos> - He'll bleed out.<eos> - No, he won't.
Just above the stomach, just below my heart.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't you just get the person that shot you last time?<eos> She said she wouldn't do it again.<eos> I need another thousand.<eos> OK.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> What if I miss?<eos> You won't.
Besides she's not hosting it, we are.<eos> At her house.<eos> Well, we can hardly have it here.<eos> First the account at the shop, and now this.<eos> George, we're making her a big part of this zoo by taking her hand-outs and we hardly know her.<eos> We've got no choice.<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> Oh, it's all right, love, come here.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> He will!
For the, um...<eos> Very good.<eos> Well... Thank you for coming here this evening.<eos> Right, good, on we go.<eos> Lights!<eos> Now, then, our zoo. It's all about the animals, of course.<eos> Um... It's about protecting them and it's about caring for them.<eos> Some of these slides are aspirations.<eos> We don't have a lion or an elephant. Not yet.<eos> But we will.
I don't want you doing that.<eos> I'll still live here.<eos> I can help out in the evenings, but during the day I'll be out in the world.<eos> If you're sure.<eos> I am.<eos> I never realised how much Mew did about the place.<eos> She's got the right idea, you know. Striking out.<eos> There's little point in sinking more blood and sweat into this place if we're only going to end up handing it over to somebody else.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Of course it will.
The Harper Avery foundation's been looking for ways to mend fences with us after what happened to you.<eos> A large cash infusion into our cardio department could allow us to attract a higher-caliber of talent, and then...<eos> Owen, don't. - The worst they can do is say no.<eos> - Please don't...<eos> - Please don't offer me this job.<eos> ♪ Take your baby by the hair ♪ I wanted to... For a week.<eos> But I know you have to go.<eos> And I know nothing good can come of me asking you to stay.<eos> ♪ We were so in phase ♪ So I'm not.<eos> ♪ In our dance hall days ♪ And I won't.
The lie protects everyone.<eos> Did you arrest Robles?<eos> It's not that easy, Sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.<eos> That should be plenty to take him down.<eos> What?<eos> I still have it.<eos> - We promised we were going to do something.<eos> - Yes. And we will, Sonya.
What the hell is going on in here?<eos> We were just catching up.<eos> That's nice, ladies.<eos> You four, in my office.<eos> - We have that meeting.<eos> - What meeting?<eos> Sorry, Don.<eos> Don't get no fresher than that.<eos> Who wants to try it?<eos> I will.
You're safe with me.<eos> But we need to get out of here right now, and we need to go straight to the airport.<eos> I'm not gonna have to follow you into the restroom every time you have to take a leak, am I?<eos> Are we good?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> Let's blow.<eos> Okay, thanks. Lila... Hey, I have to leave.<eos> If you see Amir, have him call me?<eos> It's important.<eos> Okay. I will.
But if you weren't certain, why on earth did you go to bed with him?<eos> Well, in my day... a lady was incapable of feeling physical attraction until she had been instructed to do so by her mama.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Seriously, my dear, you have to take control of your feelings... ..before they take control of you.<eos> Baxter... ~ M'Lady. ~ ..<eos> I thought a lot about what you told me yesterday.<eos> And I still think you should report Mr Coyle.<eos> I won't, M'Lady.<eos> And if that makes a difference...<eos> It won't.
Cal, do something for me?<eos> Sure.<eos> Anything.<eos> You want me to lock the back up?<eos> I want you to take the store.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It's what Dad would have wanted.<eos> Well, I, uh, I'm not... I mean, I mean, I don't... I don't even...<eos> I don't even how to... Just do good work.<eos> I will.
I'll disregard what I just heard.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Your husband owed 1.5 million in gambling debts.<eos> He illegally authorized a 3 million loan to PARK and SONG invested it in stocks.<eos> We have the motive, evidence and circumstances...<eos> It all fits together.<eos> We found you with bullet holes above your head.<eos> It's a warning.<eos> They want their file back. - Get out of my way.<eos> - I won't.
It will be, Jenny.<eos> It's just a formality.<eos> (Sighs) This is never gonna end.<eos> I don't think you can do that in here, Jenny. It's okay.<eos> Jenny, listen to me.<eos> This motion is a smoke screen.<eos> They have nothing.<eos> - Then why are they doing it?<eos> - Politics. - If they win?<eos> - They won't.
Could you go to the club and pick my stuff up?<eos> I just... I can't.<eos> Um... and tell the girls I said goodbye?<eos> Cindy, maybe we can ask... No.<eos> No, you've... you were great.<eos> Really, you've done enough. Thank you.<eos> You feel like we've done enough?<eos> I feel like we're just getting started.<eos> Hey, tell Cindy we're sorry, huh?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Go on a date with him and instead of, like, being all fake and charming like most couples are at the beginning, tell each other all your worst qualities.<eos> Nothing kills a relationship like honesty.<eos> Oh, my God, that's brilliant.<eos> Once he gets to know the real me, he'll just go running for the hills.<eos> Just like all the others.<eos> Nailed it.<eos> Okay, so we're here tonight to get to know each other and find out that we do not like each other.<eos> Okay, I understand quantum physics, but this is confusing.<eos> What if we do like each other?<eos> Oh, we won't.
I'm going to go to the doctor.<eos> Tom was supposed to meet me here, but I can't get hold of him.<eos> He must be on the tube.<eos> I'll tell him to call you as soon as he gets here.<eos> That'll be Andy.<eos> Do you want me to tell him to go straight to the doctor's or just call you?<eos> Andy, can you call me back later, please?<eos> Cheers.<eos> Just tell Tom to call me the minute he gets here, yeah?<eos> I will.
- If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.<eos> Of course we would.<eos> We're friends.<eos> We have each other's backs.<eos> That's it. That's how it works.<eos> Don't tell anyone else what you did.<eos> I'll keep your secret and we'll keep going.<eos> You know you messed up.<eos> You're trying, but, dude, you can't do something like that again.<eos> I won't.
You named your erotic sculpture "Lancelot"?<eos> It's a perfect replica of my most... powerful piece.<eos> It's also the... the perfect match to her, um...<eos> - Lady Guinevere.<eos> - Yeah. Oh. So... so the...<eos> t-the sculpture is, um, um...<eos> - Self-portrait. - Mm. Well, it was my Valentine's day gift.<eos> Y-you know what?<eos> We are, uh, not at liberty to discuss the facts of the case until one of you decides who will stay with the firm.<eos> - I will.
I may be wrong, but the thing is... ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> -Did you see anything? -No. No.<eos> I-I didn't.<eos> The thing is, Nevison...<eos> Will you let me know if... When... When they let go of her?<eos> Just so I know.<eos> Even if it's in the middle of the night. -Yeah.<eos> -I'd just like to know.<eos> I know you'll have a lot of other things to think about -when it happens...<eos> -Of course I will, Kevin.
But if you keep that goodness to yourself and you don't share it with the world, that's a greater sin than anything you think you might have done in the past.<eos> Anything...<eos> I might have done? Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> I better go.<eos> You're gonna me a wonderful mother, Tawney.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Daniel.<eos> But I can't do it again.<eos> And I won't.
Yes.<eos> He's probably her uncle, but I may have made that up to pass the time.<eos> This is Clara, not my assistant, she's, er, some other word.<eos> I'm his carer.<eos> Yeah, my carer.<eos> She cares so I don't have to.<eos> Doc...tor!<eos> Hello again.<eos> Will you...help me?<eos> Will you?
See, that's a problem, then. 155's already taken.<eos> What spots do you have open?<eos> Welterweight.<eos> Who's the fighter?<eos> Ransom Galbi.<eos> Well, I'll talk to Jay, but if he says yes, then he's on the card.<eos> Yeah, fuck, yeah!<eos> I love Jay, all right, but the fight's only three days out.<eos> He's not gonna screw me on this, is he? No.<eos> He won't.
- Of course!<eos> - Incredibly charming?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Terribly wealthy.<eos> After several years of painstaking research, I've finally got my man.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Well...<eos> You may kiss me.<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - Well, you will.
Morning.<eos> Someone has to get her back. - She won't do it on her own.<eos> - Aleksander, go get your sister! - I can't, my arm hurts.<eos> - Your arm?<eos> - Crybaby!<eos> - I'm busy on holiday. - So we aren't coming back?<eos> - Change of plans.<eos> - Rogal will get her.<eos> - No, Stefan! - He's a better candidate.<eos> - Stefan will!
- My dad dropped me.<eos> - Oh. It was the beginning of his Huntington's Disease.<eos> You know that with Huntington's, there's a 50/50 chance of...<eos> Inheriting it from an affected parent. Yep, I know.<eos> And once you get it, it's a death sentence.<eos> My dad died less than ten years after his diagnosis.<eos> There was so many things he never got a chance to do.<eos> He didn't even have a bucket list.<eos> Lance, have you taken the blood test to check for the genetic mutation?<eos> No. And I won't.
Code name,<eos> Birdman.<eos> He's evil.<eos> He hated Jerry.<eos> He is always watching, spying on Jerry, on...<eos> He knows I'm here.<eos> He knows I'm talking to you.<eos> Please don't let him get me.<eos> - Please don't let him...<eos> - I won't...
- No!<eos> Like I was never even here!<eos> Don't!<eos> Stop it. Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop.<eos> - No!<eos> - Let go!<eos> - Let go!<eos> - No, you won't now.
I think that's best.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Eli?<eos> At least look at me.<eos> What am I supposed to do with myself?<eos> Aren't you done with me telling you?<eos> What are you waiting for anyway?<eos> She won't even open the door.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - She won't.
I had so much to drink, and I have this crushing hangover.<eos> - Can we talk about this later? - W...<eos> Well, here, why don't you throw this on, and we'll get a greasy breakfast in you, stat?<eos> I can't.<eos> Amy, I'm not letting you pull away.<eos> We're spending the rest of our lives together, so we just...<eos> We have to work this out.<eos> Okay?<eos> Talk it out.<eos> Okay, and we will.
- Can we talk about this later? - W...<eos> Well, here, why don't you throw this on, and we'll get a greasy breakfast in you, stat?<eos> I can't.<eos> Amy, I'm not letting you pull away.<eos> We're spending the rest of our lives together, so we just...<eos> We have to work this out.<eos> Okay?<eos> Talk it out.<eos> Okay, and we will.<eos> We will, just not right now.
I don't know, maybe, maybe tell her to stay overseas or something.<eos> You're asking me to do something you can't do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, listen, you can take care of yourself but you've got to make sure Carly is safe.<eos> I don't know, maybe, maybe tell her to stay overseas or something.<eos> For crying out loud, you stupid bitch!<eos> You have to do Bea Smith! What do you think is gonna happen to me?<eos> You've got to do it!<eos> - Will you miss me?<eos> - I will for sure.
- None... or none you will speak of?<eos> None.<eos> We're talking about my father.<eos> I will know what danger he faces.<eos> Our father.<eos> I share news of danger with him alone. I disclose to the Khan.<eos> It is for the Khan to report to the Prince. That is the order of things.<eos> You want to know about Eagle's Teaching, ask Father, brother.<eos> If you know something... the burden is on you to defend him.<eos> And I will... with my life.
All right.<eos> I thought you said you talked to her.<eos> She's late again.<eos> I did, and I thought she got the message, but...<eos> This is getting old, Gunnar.<eos> All right, I'll call her, and I'll see what's going on.<eos> [Ringing] Kiley: Hello?<eos> Please tell me you're on your way to pick up Micah.<eos> I can't lose him, Gunnar.<eos> And you won't.
- I miss you!<eos> Ever seen a Havok nuke before?<eos> Only virtually.<eos> How 'bout battle? Seen that?<eos> Thing you don't understand about Sedrans.<eos> We've lived in a state of perpetual war, surrounded by enemies.<eos> We were born fighting.<eos> That may be.<eos> But make a mistake with that, you won't even have time to know you made a mistake.<eos> No one in 100 kilometers will.
It's gonna turn them against each other.<eos> Ethan is the only one who can help her right now.<eos> You have to get him in.<eos> Okay.<eos> On the condition that you stay where it's safe.<eos> Ethan.<eos> Mr. Jackson gave us building schematics, access codes; everything you need.<eos> I uploaded your neural net. Okay?<eos> Since you're not in the system, you'll need to manually enter the codes on the keypads as you go.<eos> No, I won't.
Oh, I would've.<eos> But I already know what you did to make it up to me.<eos> Natasha told you?<eos> When?<eos> When she showed up at my place.<eos> Natasha's at your apartment? Okay. She's wanted by the FBI.<eos> Your apology was sounding a lot better a few seconds ago.<eos> She's a fugitive.<eos> What are you gonna do if she gets discovered?<eos> She won't.
Somebody's using my resources to pass classified secrets.<eos> And I thought that Borz might know about it, but...<eos> He was close to some people when he worked for me that were involved.<eos> That's what you couldn't tell me?<eos> I run a company that has several hundred million dollars in federal contracts, based in part on the fact that I can keep secrets.<eos> Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Who's that?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> What does she want?<eos> She needs us back at the office.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
It's not that easy, sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico city has eva's affidavit.<eos> That should be plenty<eos> To take him down. No, they don't.<eos> What?<eos> I still have it.<eos> We promised we were going to do something.<eos> Yes.<eos> And we will, sonya.
And Victoria needs the charity cred, and dear, sweet Elka needs her endorsement.<eos> Oh, bless you, my angel.<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> You guilted me into this date, and now you think you can guilt me into sticking with it.<eos> Well, it's not gonna work.<eos> Not this time.<eos> So you're ending the date?<eos> No.<eos> But you're never gonna do anything for us like this again?<eos> No, I probably will.
Oh, there it is.<eos> I won't let you disappoint her the way you've disappointed everyone else in your life.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You know dad, did it ever occur to you that you disappointed me?<eos> Never.<eos> Oh, uh, by the way, your wife, she barely touched her food, and, uh, what with that and the slight tremor, my guess is Adderall.<eos> You might want to look into that. Come on.<eos> - Well, so much for avoiding the big blowout. - Had to be done.<eos> God, I hope I don't blow this.<eos> You won't.
I can' it's used<eos> I'd get pennies on the dollar.<eos> My God.<eos> But if you could just trust me... That things are gonna be fine.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - So here we are again.<eos> - No.<eos> You said that I would never have to make this call.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - And I won't.
I'd get pennies on the dollar.<eos> My God.<eos> But if you could just trust me... That things are gonna be fine.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - So here we are again.<eos> - No.<eos> You said that I would never have to make this call.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - And I won't.<eos> I won't, David.
Where were you thinking of putting him?<eos> I was gonna defer to you on that one.<eos> Miss Rosemary's baby in 515b.<eos> So we ignore her?<eos> As long as possible.<eos> All right, here's the file.<eos> I know just where this Jordi should go.<eos> Yeah, I thought so, too.<eos> So do you want to talk to Leo or should I?<eos> I will.
Well, it's my name, and it's real, so...<eos> When you were three years old, you were abducted from the front lawn of your home in great falls, Virginia.<eos> The woman you think is your mother is not your mother.<eos> She's your kidnapper.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> No, stop talking, stop talking!<eos> Please, please, please... Carter, Carter.<eos> I just wanna go home, okay?<eos> - Okay. - I just wanna go see my mom.<eos> All right, Carter, and you will.
I thought you guys said she was a bad influence.<eos> 'Cause she's a friend of your sister's, and I think that she's grown up a lot this year.<eos> I heard she got expelled.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> She spent a little time in rehab.<eos> Horsies!<eos> Stop! I want to pet the horsie!<eos> Uh, we can't stop now, honey, but on the way back we can.<eos> But I want to pet the horsie!<eos> You will.
Bassam, I lose.<eos> Uh, everything our father built, everything we achieved... everything we are ceases to be.<eos> I get that.<eos> I do. But look, the days when a single family... can continue to rule by sheer force of will... are pretty much over with or without elections.<eos> So if you lose, you lose.<eos> And you wake up the next day and you start living the rest of your life. Except no one's hanging you. No one's shoving a bayonet up your ass.<eos> The crowd isn't calling for your head.<eos> You just go away. You-you move your money to Switzerland or wherever guys like you move your money. Buy your own goddamn island, and you're still one of the richest men in the world.<eos> But here's the thing. I don't think you're gonna lose.<eos> - I won't?
My son is there every fucking day.<eos> - Are they doing coke around him?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We don't do it ourselves.<eos> We don't bring it to the ranch.<eos> We don't sell to kids, ever.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Oh, how principled of you.<eos> Well, if you want to go, just... just go.<eos> Yeah, I will.
You're here to expand UNSC's power, nothing else.<eos> Without a clue about the cultures you assimilate.<eos> He says he's only a middleman.<eos> Told to carry some things to a landing site and not to ask any questions.<eos> But he did anyhow.<eos> He couldn't find out what he was carrying, but found out where it came from.<eos> He says it's sourced from a place no one will go.<eos> He says it's sourced from hell.<eos> A place so doomed even the Elites Zealots won't go there.<eos> So they but it from someone who will.
Old sins.<eos> How'd you land here?<eos> Oh. Wendy just got out.<eos> Only other people with keys are Me and gemma.<eos> What are we doing here, son?<eos> You can go.<eos> Got no place I got to Be.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What if I change my mind?<eos> You won't.
Go to hell, Rush!<eos> - Alex, I...<eos> - No, I'm not taking any more advice from you.<eos> - No more favors, okay?<eos> - Alex... I'll handle it myself.<eos> I'll fix it. - Alex! - It was my decision.<eos> I will...<eos> I will call my dad.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yeah. I will.
- Why was she in here?<eos> She can't know what we're doing unless...<eos> No, there's only one Librarian,<eos> - and he was just spotted in...<eos> - Budapest, I think.<eos> Expedite the time table just in case.<eos> Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.<eos> Honestly, how hard is it to knock?<eos> And if these people come back?<eos> They won't.
Elite.<eos> Was that insult accidental or intentional?<eos> No. Seriously.<eos> There were 300 applicants for your spot.<eos> Beth chose you.<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I'll have to ask her sometime.<eos> Unless you were a favor, somebody owes somebody something, you're the lou.<eos> Why don't you ask Beth yourself?<eos> I will.
Which means the meltdown is 100% no longer a threat, correct? Correct.<eos> And then I get hammered.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> You got roughly 45 minutes.<eos> Take your car, get Ralph, drive like hell past the Santa Monica mountains.<eos> Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
Turn off!<eos> It does not look here!<eos> - Where is our CEO?<eos> - Have not seen him in a while.<eos> Call him and try again every fifteen minutes!<eos> How the heck can he be?<eos> Buy yourself a nice funeral, your dirty pussy.<eos> Is it available here, ladies?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - That all men will:
- Go, Mom.<eos> Well, Ali's still suffering in silence.<eos> Ah, the poor thing.<eos> I could barely get a smile out of her.<eos> If we didn't know, I'd ask her, "What's wrong?<eos> Why you being so quiet?"<eos> So ask.<eos> I'm afraid she'll make me.<eos> You're ex-CIA.<eos> She won't.
Ugh.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that a worm?<eos> It's a worm.<eos> Can you... can you just get it out of me, please?<eos> Yes. I need to go slow.<eos> I don't want it to break and leave any in you.<eos> Okay, that's fine.<eos> Take your time, but just get it out.<eos> I will.
No, I didn't.<eos> It's true... they sold to all of Long Island, half the city, and there was never a bust out here.<eos> Too far out, I suppose.<eos> Too unassuming.<eos> Hmm, what are you trying to tell me, Mr. Solloway?<eos> I'm just trying to give you a little context for this town, Detective.<eos> There are feuds out here that have been going on for almost a century.<eos> Between the Hodges and the Lockharts?<eos> Do yourself a favor. Read my book.<eos> Okay, I will.
- I'm not selling it.<eos> That was a mistake Cole made.<eos> He was upset about his brother, which I understand, but you can't make a sentimental decision like that about something so big.<eos> I'm gonna wait until the commercial loan comes through, and then I'm gonna sit the boys down and I'll tell them the good news.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> They all think they're about to be rich.<eos> They've been making plans.<eos> When they find out...<eos> - Whey're not going to find out.<eos> - Of course they will.
Neal and Graham.<eos> Even Walsh.<eos> I lost everyone.<eos> I... I can't lose you, too.<eos> Well, love, you don't have to worry about me.<eos> If there's one thing I'm good at, it's surviving.<eos> Don't worry, dearie.<eos> It's only me.<eos> Sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted.<eos> They will.
Not for me. For you.<eos> I'm a foreigner.<eos> There are limits on what they can do to me.<eos> But you're a national.<eos> If that was the ISI that you saw, the same people who roughed you up before, and they somehow know what we've got going on, this time, there are no limits.<eos> You will end up at the bottom of a hole.<eos> Or worse.<eos> (sighs heavily) We've got to push back our departure.<eos> - No. - Just until things cool off.<eos> They won't.
She's a married woman.<eos> You're to give Agnes her job back.<eos> You told me to get rid of her.<eos> Now I'm telling you to bring her back.<eos> I know why you're doing this.<eos> You're using her.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It were making her ill.<eos> She won't want to come back.<eos> She will.
No.<eos> Someone knows. He's scum.<eos> He's threatened to tell Helen.<eos> Well, we can't let Helen know.<eos> I'll pay you back.<eos> Stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Just... whatever you do, don't get all sensitive and tell Helen to make yourself feel better.<eos> That will help no one.<eos> I won't.
If I hear from him.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> Washington has repeatedly exploited Pakistan and interfered in our affairs.<eos> No self-respecting state can accept such dictates, not even from a superpower.<eos> It's a stain on our honor.<eos> If they want to break relations with us, I say good riddance.<eos> A career official in the Foreign Ministry, Tasneem Qureishi has emerged in the last few days as a leading...<eos> Hey. You're gonna drive yourself crazy.<eos> I wish it would just happen already.<eos> Maybe it never will.
- wrote "Sussudio."<eos> - Jimmy...<eos> But if one day, right?<eos> Eggs forced you to choose between themselves and pancakes, and you chose the soggy, tasteless pancakes, and you never ate eggs again, I'm just saying eggs... eggs would be really sad.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - What?<eos> If you don't want me to go on this trip,<eos> - just tell me.<eos> - Don't go.<eos> Okay. I won't.
- I hope you will agree.<eos> To our future as property magnates.<eos> Very well.<eos> I can see there's no escape, and I must tell the truth.<eos> - I've never caught you in a lie.<eos> - No, I don't lie, but there are things I don't say.<eos> I've allowed this folly to go on because...<eos> I don't know, really, because it was a nice idea.<eos> And I would have liked to come in with you, I would have...<eos> - But you won't.
-You already knew who you were gonna see.<eos> You thought you could at least scare Chloe Amos -before she got to speak to us, right?<eos> -I thought it was Taylor.<eos> Where did you pick Chloe up, Aaron?<eos> I've never seen her before.<eos> I thought it was Taylor.<eos> -And where were you at noon today?<eos> -At work, till one.<eos> -Phone and check.<eos> -I will.
- We have to.<eos> You want us to excavate this whole place?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> We bring Leonard Vance here.<eos> I think I'd rather dig.<eos> He knew about the tooth.<eos> We've no choice.<eos> And who goes to DCS Drayton to get authorisation to bring a convicted serial killer out for the day?<eos> I will.
Was it Bethany?<eos> It's not going to be that easy, bitch.<eos> Ali made hiding things into a game.<eos> You're out on bail for a murder charge, Spencer.<eos> Well, it's not a perfect plan, but it's all I've got.<eos> And I saw the look on my mom's face after we met my lawyers for the last time.<eos> We've already lost.<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> But, hey, what if Ali leaves the dance early?<eos> She won't.
About an hour and a half out.<eos> Is there anything you want to tell me?<eos> You mean what Saul said to me last night.<eos> He's not gonna allow himself to be recaptured.<eos> He said take him out if it comes to that.<eos> Which is exactly what you said he'd want.<eos> No one wants that.<eos> He made me promise.<eos> If it comes to that. - Yep.<eos> - Which it won't.
I never said it was easy.<eos> Just possible.<eos> Look here, soldier of misfortune.<eos> You may not care if I get killed, but I'll bet the rest of humanity does.<eos> There's no way I'm doing this.<eos> I don't care about you or the rest of humanity.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You bit me.<eos> I ought to shoot you right now.<eos> But you won't.
I don't see how the truth harms anyone, adults or children.<eos> Ok, so what am I supposed to tell him if he asks how she--<eos> Hmm. I gotta go.<eos> It's work.<eos> Go.<eos> We're fine here.<eos> Mom...<eos> Do not say anything more to Henry about Roz.<eos> Please.<eos> I won't.
Let it go.<eos> She's got more napkin rings to make.<eos> Can I ask one favor?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Apparently, I owe you.<eos> While I'm stuck in here, is there any way you'd consider house-sitting for me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Got you covered.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> I will.
You're so good.<eos> Are you sure that's the only reason you came over? What?<eos> Not because you fancy me and can't stop thinking about me?<eos> Don't kid yourself, girl, this is purely business.<eos> ♪ Could it be you're shy of love?<eos> ~ (Squeals) ~ Not on me shirt! Get off!<eos> Come back!<eos> ~ I can't do this. ~ What are you talking about?<eos> ~ What if I mess up again?<eos> ~ You won't.
You'd told him I'd been in hospital.<eos> He brought flowers. Why didn't you tell me last night?<eos> What the hell is going on, Vince?<eos> Where were you?<eos> With Col? No. You know where I was, it was that job I told you about.<eos> He wanted some driving doing last minute, so I just lied.<eos> Saying I'd been in hospital? It was the first thing that came into my head, sorry.<eos> Vince, he was clearly checking up on you.<eos> What if he sacks you?<eos> He won't.
You don't think that this kills me, too?<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> I don't think you care one way or the other.<eos> I'm with him every day.<eos> For two minutes.<eos> Now, I made a promise to that little boy, a promise I intend to keep.<eos> You should know better than anyone that we don't make promises here.<eos> We're just gonna hang out here for a minute before they're ready for you in the O.R.<eos> Will you take a picture of my guts when I'm opened up?<eos> I will not.
You took advice from a bear.<eos> Good point.<eos> I won't do that again.<eos> Now I've got some advice for you.<eos> - Lay it on me.<eos> - From now on, you are going to do everything she says, and beg her for your old job back.<eos> I hate you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I can't spend another night in this stump dump.<eos> We've gotta get our place back.<eos> We will, Malloy.
So there's no way to trace those feeds of Oren and Kent and the timer will just keep counting down until one of them is dead?<eos> It's all up to Beckett now.<eos> Adam, just answer one question, and it might save your life.<eos> Where are Oren and Kent?<eos> If you cops were capable of doing your jobs, you'd know.<eos> And, looking back, maybe none of this would have ever happened.<eos> Look, a horrible thing was done to you.<eos> But how is killing two more people going to fix that?<eos> How is that gonna heal you?<eos> It won't.
Look. I promise.<eos> Please. Please just let me go.<eos> Let you go?<eos> What, after you snuck into my home, hid here, waiting to kill me?<eos> You are a very sick young lady, and everyone knows that you're the one with psychiatric problems.<eos> You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
Does that mean you found a match?<eos> The sorcerer did locate a third magical sister, yes, and she... will be a perfect match.<eos> What do you mean, "will be"?<eos> Therein lies the catch.<eos> She is not born yet. How does the sorcerer know something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the dark one, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
And you work this crappy minimum-wage job at Gettysburger to help out.<eos> You're a hard worker...<eos> A bootstrapper.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But you should know, I will personally make sure you lose that scholarship and this crappy minimum-wage job and any chance you have of a future if you don't tell me where you're keeping the video of the girl you and your buddy screwed at that party last night.<eos> I need answers, Bobby. [Stammers, gasps] [Camera shutter clicking]<eos> Hey, Jake, it's me.<eos> Sorry I haven't had time to talk, but I was thinking, my place for dinner tonight?<eos> I'll cook.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Permission granted.<eos> I know I asked for this, and I know you're just trying to help,<eos> - but I already did all this...<eos> - This isn't the academy,<eos> Dawson.<eos> What you're doing here, now, this is the Christopher Herrmann School of Firefighting, learned from a lifetime on the job.<eos> I appreciate that, and I will do whatever you say, Herrmann.<eos> All I'm asking is that when we're on calls, you let me do my job.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
I say that's impressive.<eos> I hadn't thought about it like that.<eos> And anyway, it was not all those things I fell in love with. It was you, Ian.<eos> Ah, it's... Well, it's Phil.<eos> My name's actually Phil. Philip, really.<eos> Is there anything else you want to tell me? Is that everything now?<eos> No, that's it. It's just...<eos> CLINKING Can I call you again?<eos> You had better.<eos> OK, I will.
Those photos...<eos> Who took them?<eos> - How did you have them?<eos> - How did you have them?<eos> You stole them from my safe-deposit box, and you took that knife.<eos> The investigation of Conrad's murder was heating up.<eos> I had to lead them away from you.<eos> By handing them my knife?<eos> If they link that to me...<eos> They won't.
- He did nothing wrong.<eos> - Then subpoena him<eos> - and have him say that.<eos> - He has nothing to do with the coke going missing.<eos> Well, neither do you.<eos> But they'll crucify him.<eos> Cary, they're crucifying you.<eos> Look, you have to tell them that you were under orders.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then I will.
Jonathan was a good kid.<eos> You know, he was helping with Robbie's charity.<eos> I didn't even ask him to-- he just showed up and donated his time and helped us raise money.<eos> Hey, did Robbie ever get that...<eos> Replica NCIS badge?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He wears it constantly.<eos> He tried to arrest the neighbors the other day.<eos> Tell him I'll give him a call when I'm in a fix.<eos> I will, I will.
Then that will be the truth of it.<eos> My job is not about finding the truth. It's about defending my client.<eos> Detective Murdoch, do you have something to say?<eos> Your Honour, we need to confirm that it was indeed Percival Thompson whom the night clerk saw on the night in question.<eos> I have a photograph of Mr. Thompson.<eos> How are we to know that this is in fact the defendant's husband?<eos> - Ask his wife.<eos> - The defense has no further questions.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Detective, if you will.
Keep her away from them! Follow me, ma'am.<eos> What was that?<eos> You just took Amelia's surgery?<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Take her side.<eos> She was being attacked.<eos> The woman had it out for her, Meredith.<eos> If anything goes wrong, she'll go blaming her because she was an addict.<eos> You're gonna go talk to Owen, right, and clear this up?<eos> Yes, I will.
It's stupid.<eos> - That's on purpose.<eos> It makes it sticky.<eos> People remember it.<eos> I don't want to be remembered for a closeted dinosaur.<eos> - Why don't you leave that with me?<eos> - No, I've got it.<eos> Alicia, leave it with me.<eos> - Don't let him get in your head.<eos> - He won't.
She would never come forward on her own, but...<eos> I'm her mother and when I saw the bruising...<eos> Well, I had no choice but to report it to you.<eos> My little girl is being terrorized.<eos> - She's just seven years old.<eos> - You're doing the right thing.<eos> No child deserves to be treated like that.<eos> I just want it to stop.<eos> And it will.
No?<eos> You're a thief, aren't you?<eos> Let's see how good you are.<eos> A challenge.<eos> Bodies are so much bulkier than jewels.<eos> And yet you seemed right at home.<eos> I guess once a thief, always a thief.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> So, have you thought of a plan when they discover her remains are missing?<eos> They won't.
I can't do it anymore.<eos> Guide her in her duties of a wife.<eos> Jacob looked so happy.<eos> - And bless this union.<eos> - Your posture!<eos> This is gonna be a great wedding.<eos> As you ready her for...<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't do this!<eos> I won't!
Then start with the other half.<eos> Prepping the kiln.<eos> Uh... got the wedge, uh, drive rod, and... shoulder bolt.<eos> You know more than you let on.<eos> I watch you work sometimes.<eos> Thank you for making this creepy.<eos> Now find the other parts.<eos> Is it gonna hit me?<eos> It shouldn't.<eos> It won't.
Papers call him the John Gotti of Chicago.<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> Get a bite to eat with me?<eos> I thought you were working at Molly's?<eos> Right, you're right. I am.<eos> I could ask Herrmann to close out for me.<eos> All right.<eos> Well...<eos> let me know.<eos> Yeah, I will...
So do I.<eos> - Good-bye, Nathan.<eos> - Stop-<eos> - I don't have time for this. - Duke,<eos> Mara turned you into some kind of trouble bomb, and she...<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm taking her to a thinny, an open one.<eos> A what?<eos> You can't let her through a thinny...<eos> I won't.
I was only five.<eos> I never wanted it.<eos> It's what you wanted me to do.<eos> Even at that age, I wanted to please you and went to sets, but once I got used to it, you two got divorced, and took me to Spain.<eos> You threw me away.<eos> But what?<eos> You want to see me on TV again?<eos> How could you burden me with your last breaths?<eos> I'll be an actress, a real one.<eos> Not because of your will.
- This way.<eos> - My husband hanged himself to avoid the king's guards.<eos> They'll come for me soon.<eos> You have to get me out of France!<eos> I can't help you if you don't help me.<eos> I need information on the men that carried out this attack.<eos> - Do you know where they are?<eos> - If I talk to you, they'll know.<eos> - They'll kill me.<eos> - MARY: No, they won't.
What good would it have done for me to put you in that kind of danger?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I don't know if it would have gone differently or better, but you never gave us a chance.<eos> And now we'll never know. (sniffles)<eos> I've had some time to think.<eos> I believe that we should lead separate lives.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That we will continue to work together as king and queen, but that I will be your wife in name only.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
Did she now?<eos> You did a lot of good stuff for my kids when I wasn't there for them, and I never thanked you.<eos> So... thank you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, is this one of those amends things?<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in. Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
If they say I've slept with a 15 yr old, I generally have.<eos> If they say I've come pled suicide, I generally have.<eos> Yes, I read about you with the... girl.<eos> You haven't... you two haven't?<eos> You're asking whether we've slept together?<eos> - You think that I've...<eos> - Martin! At least I'm legal.<eos> Yes, I value our friendship too much to complicate it.<eos> Do you plan to maintain your relationship with Jess?<eos> Yeah, of course he will.
Bullshit.<eos> We're ripping this place a new asshole.<eos> Move or die.<eos> I hope you don't mind me saying this, but... you look hot.<eos> There's no reason to leave anybody alive.<eos> Nobody's innocent.<eos> And we can't leave anybody able to talk.<eos> Don't go soft on me, kid.<eos> Don't leave anybody breathing.<eos> I won't.
The sorcerer did locate a third magical sister, yes, and she... will be a perfect match.<eos> What do you mean, "will be"?<eos> Therein lies the catch.<eos> She is not born yet.<eos> How does the sorcerer know something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the Dark One, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
War will come.<eos> You can't protect us.<eos> I'll find a way.<eos> Vlad!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Whatever haunts Broken Tooth, I know it kills Turks.<eos> You returned.<eos> No one has ever returned.<eos> It seems no one has ever had the privilege of leaving, either.<eos> Neither will you.
Go tell your men to search everywhere.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Teach these people a lesson, find anything suspicious.<eos> Now go at once!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Spread out!<eos> Stay still!<eos> How romantic.<eos> - I'm going to have to talk to his commanding officer.<eos> -No, you won't.
You okay, sir? Yeah, I am fine.<eos> Work off the standpipe.<eos> This is really good barbecue.<eos> You don't want to regret not trying it.<eos> Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?<eos> Even if Bobby was coming with the money... you'd still kill us both.<eos> But he's not coming.<eos> He will be here.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
Then, come the mistakes.<eos> The compromises.<eos> We create our own demons.<eos> Great to see you!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.<eos> It took some tinkering.<eos> But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"<eos> Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.<eos> And now, neither will I.
- Jack, that's you, isn't it?<eos> - Yup. Last year.<eos> They still won.<eos> Look at them.<eos> Souvenir history.<eos> To make people think they left some mark on the world.<eos> Because otherwise, nobody would ever know.<eos> I never want to end up on that wall.<eos> Have no fear.<eos> You never will.
He sent them back to the place of their birth.<eos> Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.<eos> Erik severed the link between giants and men.<eos> And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> The mystical relics were all that remained safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep.<eos> And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend.<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?<eos> Jack's a brilliant businessman.<eos> He was always able to imbue his products with a magic of big ideas, but Wyatt was the brains.<eos> Without his designs, none of it would have been possible.<eos> Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.<eos> For Goddard, yes.<eos> Wyatt gave him the best years of his life.<eos> Jock lost his son Dylan to a drug overdose.<eos> So, if you talk about losing your mother...<eos> No, I won't.
You heard him. This is a party for Scare students.<eos> I am a Scare student.<eos> I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance.<eos> Aw, snap!<eos> My chances are just as good as yours.<eos> You're not even in the same league with me.<eos> Just wait, hotshot. I'm going to scare circles around you this year.<eos> Okay. I'd like to see that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
She's sleepwalking again?<eos> She hasn't done that for a while.<eos> She ended up in Andrea's room too. I think kind of freaked her out.<eos> That's not good.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know. Honey, you got another bruise here.<eos> Does that hurt?<eos> That's weird.<eos> I don't know. Will you do me a favor, go see a doctor for that?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Stay off the phone!<eos> Go.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No, you stay with Judy.<eos> Only way to protect Judy is if we stop this where it started.<eos> Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.<eos> That's exactly why I am going.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you walk into this alone?<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
It'll happen so fast, you won't be able to open your fucking eyes.<eos> Now you see that guy over there?<eos> I'm gonna get him to help me.<eos> He just waved at me.<eos> - He just...<eos> - Yeah, well, that's what he does.<eos> Season's greetings from Canada.<eos> Did you say "please" at least?<eos> You know, if they call the cops, we're done.<eos> Oh, he won't.
Before she hurt me.<eos> I followed her.<eos> Then it happened.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> I saw it all.<eos> She loved me.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her.<eos> And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
Citizens of Emerald City.<eos> Witness what happens when you defy me.<eos> Glinda did very well for herself today, I'll admit.<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Unchain her, you witch!<eos> We know the truth.<eos> You poisoned the king! Guards!<eos> Get them under control.<eos> The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!<eos> We will not! Silence!
It was the lark, the herald of the morn.<eos> No nightingale.<eos> Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.<eos> Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<eos> I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<eos> I do not think the light is daylight yet.<eos> I am content if you would have it so.<eos> I have more heart to stay than will to go.<eos> Come, death, and welcome.<eos> Juliet wills it so.
You guys all right?<eos> You guys Okay?<eos> Pay-per-view!<eos> Pay-per-view!<eos> Pay-per-view!<eos> - It's gonna be real.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> I'm not believing you brought this boy to the bar.<eos> We're going to the movies.<eos> We will.
What the hell happened to them?<eos> It's low pressure.<eos> They've got the bends.<eos> When are you guys gonna get it?<eos> It's not them anymore! They're gone!<eos> Fuck!<eos> That door is reinforced steel. They can't get through.<eos> They have power tools. They have high explosives! They can get out!<eos> If they drill the door the decompression'll kill them.<eos> - It won't.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> There should be more blood.<eos> Six months.<eos> What a mess.<eos> I thought we were home free.<eos> What's Kate gonna tell the kids? Shh.<eos> I can't... I can't remember what they look like.<eos> You tell them I was thinking about them.<eos> Do that for me? I will.<eos> Of course. Of course I will.
Coffee's inside, come on.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Everybody is worried about you!<eos> I'm done.<eos> It's over.<eos> No, no way.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> I can't even pay the rent.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> And yes, you will.
Doodly Do found his way home.<eos> Now, sir, account for yourself.<eos> Evening, Mr. Sheriff, Mr. Stubbs.<eos> We had a deal, Allen.<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> To take a gentleman on the river.<eos> However, Mr. Graham proved to be no gentleman at all.<eos> See, I feared he'd bring embarrassment to you and your lovely family, boasting as it were over his intentions towards your daughter.<eos> I... I... I resolutely refused to take a cent of your money, sir.<eos> Please, if you will...
No Bolton, Jesse.<eos> But I did find Balakian, Jeremiah.<eos> We sent Mr. Balakian an offer of admission, which he accepted.<eos> The only thing is, I don't remember making him an offer of admission.<eos> But I do remember your plea that we do so.<eos> You have exposed this office and the university to a completely undeserved scandal.<eos> If word of this were ever to get out, the damage would be irreparable.<eos> Well, I won't tell anyone.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
I didn't know how.<eos> Well.<eos> Maybe we can find another way.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Remember how she used to light up a room?<eos> Like the sun.<eos> Pauline does that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't let her get away.<eos> I won't.
Maybe we can find another way.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Remember how she used to light up a room?<eos> Like the sun.<eos> Pauline does that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't let her get away.<eos> I won't.<eos> Don't let her run away.<eos> I won't.
Sold for £12,500,000.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Am I allowed to say hello to you in public?<eos> Oh, Billy!<eos> You were fantastic, my friend.<eos> I'm happy for you. I'm going to miss you.<eos> You say it as though we're never going to meet again.<eos> Of course we will.
And not really good enough isn't really good at all.<eos> Not at that level.<eos> I tried to give it up. I tried everything I could to kick it.<eos> -I should have tried hypnotism.<eos> -You should.<eos> Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
I totally understand.<eos> It's business.<eos> But it isn't just business, is it?<eos> It's passion, love.<eos> Which is why we are prepared to risk our lives for it.<eos> Not me.<eos> If I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.<eos> How do you know you will make money here?<eos> You haven't yet.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
You're so light on your feet, you look like a nutcracker.<eos> But none of it from the ball.<eos> I think you just complimented me.<eos> Jane, I need to tell you something.<eos> I'm not meant to say or do these things, my aunt would kill me, but...<eos> You are my sun and my moon.<eos> My earth and my stars.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Marry you?<eos> Oh, my God, of course I will.
They're like a family.<eos> Sam was right.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> - Sir! Sir?<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - In all its glory.<eos> Chester, look, I can't do this.<eos> Oh, okay. I will.
Can you save him?<eos> I could, but he'd only live another 80 years at most.<eos> The humane thing is to put him to sleep.<eos> Oh!<eos> Stop!<eos> I won't let you do it!<eos> Dad?<eos> Because you have to do it.<eos> Be a man for once and fleam this wretched creature.<eos> I won't.
Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> What if I throw in giant robot head for nice officer?<eos> Thanks for all your help, officer!<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Boy, Bender, you sure were chock full of parts.<eos> I didn't even know you had a wishbone.<eos> I had a lot of magic things.<eos> And we'll never get them all back.<eos> Oh, sure we will.
How does he get people to blow them self up for him?<eos> He uses a remote detonator, right?<eos> He ​​leaves nothing to change.<eos> You think Malik switched Sultana with another woman?<eos> - I know he did.<eos> Why?<eos> And how?<eos> How he did it, I know.<eos> But why, haven't figured out yet.<eos> I will.
Sex sells. Seen this?<eos> Don't Hate, Emulate.<eos> I tell you, these housewives, they're like a gold mine.<eos> Harpy, I've been in this business a long time.<eos> That novel is not the game changer that you need.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> You know what you need to do.<eos> Oh. Stan, no.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will not.
I always liked the name Ethan for a boy. Charlotte for a girl.<eos> You have baby names?<eos> You want babies?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Don't you?<eos> What'd you say we let the Mama take a look?<eos> I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised... She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.
One more step and 9000 volts.<eos> We'll be having a BBQ.<eos> At the behest of The Ash, I warn you...<eos> You're a human.<eos> And she's not Light Fae.<eos> Which means I can sell her baby to either side.<eos> And I'll be damned if I'm going to lose a chance to breed a Succubus.<eos> No...!<eos> - I would rather die.<eos> - You will.
Is that what you think?<eos> You destroyed us.<eos> You ran off in the middle of the night.<eos> We lost our standing.<eos> We were almost exiled.<eos> No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
I'm... I'm not taking a radio.<eos> Please, Robyn, just take the radio.<eos> You want to die out there or something?<eos> Take the radio. In case.<eos> OK, I'll take the radio, but I'm not taking the bike.<eos> You know, it's really reassuring to know that my sister won't be alone out there.<eos> I'm only meeting up with her four or five times.<eos> Two or three times. Two or three.<eos> No, I don't want a gun.<eos> But you will.
- before him, before anybody else does. - What?<eos> Are you fucking crazy?<eos> - No.<eos> - They're not gonna leave the money<eos> - on the street anymore anyway, okay? - So we go inside and get it!<eos> Just fucking forget it. Forget everything.<eos> There's cameras at every door, okay?<eos> So why am I even talking? I'm not even... I'm not...<eos> Cops won't expect it.<eos> Nobody will.
Why am I wasting my time?<eos> Huh?<eos> Go to hell, both of you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're fired.<eos> I quit.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This ever happens again...<eos> It won't.
But they're all Gay, aren't they?<eos> It's true, isn't it?<eos> I hung up that ad this afternoon.<eos> Did you?<eos> Good for you.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> You make beautiful things.<eos> - But nobody wants them.<eos> They will again. Some day.
Most people forget to bring theirs when they travel.<eos> Thank you, Mary.<eos> Well, I think the birthday girl should make a toast.<eos> No, no.<eos> Just a drop, don't worry.<eos> Speech.<eos> Here's to the rock beneath us that shores up this house, and... to everything in life that may seem improbable, but is not impossible.<eos> I'll drink to that. I love the Calder on you.<eos> You should have kept it.<eos> Perhaps I will.
I hope you saved something for tomorrow night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> For the first time, I actually feel kind of confident.<eos> So I was just reading online...<eos> - Bup, bup, bup, bup. - What is it now?<eos> She's in a self-imposed media blackout until opening.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I just want to focus on giving the best performance I can.<eos> All you have to do is make it till tomorrow night.<eos> And I will.
I quit.<eos> You're not really quitting, are you?<eos> Look, this isn't what I signed up for.<eos> I don't believe in this anymore.<eos> But you can't leave.<eos> Well, apparently I can, and you should find a way out as well.<eos> Hey, I'm not like you.<eos> This is my big break.<eos> It may never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
Just take a minute.<eos> We'll go from the top.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> No, don't worry about it.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Okay. I'll be right back.<eos> What a jackass.<eos> Adam was right.<eos> [Sighs] I just don't want the show to get screwed up just because I broke up with him.<eos> It won't.
With what?<eos> With Crystal.<eos> What about her?<eos> What's she hanging around those crazy girls for?<eos> She's been hanging around them girls for years.<eos> She got a boyfriend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you go ask her yourself.<eos> 'Cause she won't talk to me.<eos> Of course she won't.
I have to think it over, I can't...<eos> You've already thought it over.<eos> In truth, your journey has already begun.<eos> Time... is a river.<eos> You have already made the decision.<eos> You make it every time.<eos> He's done the coin thing, has he?<eos> You're the map maker.<eos> I thought you needed rescuing?<eos> - I will.
That's a Jewish surname.<eos> Explains why she's buried in a pauper's graveyard.<eos> Who is she?<eos> And what is she to Riario?<eos> Maybe only gets stiff for the stiff.<eos> You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
At last, brothers, yes!<eos> The veil torn asunder for all time!<eos> Emily?<eos> Should I not wait outside, sir?<eos> No, no.<eos> She'll be cheered by the visit, I'm sure.<eos> Emily?<eos> What on earth is going on?<eos> Mrs Reid.<eos> I'll, er...
Don't pity him.<eos> Guess where he is now?<eos> Valkyries have taken him home to Valhalla.<eos> Right at this moment he is... He is drinking ale with the gods.<eos> Yes.<eos> He is happier than even we are. With our boat and... These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of King Aelle, and King Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will. If the gods will it.
You keep saying I don't know who I am?<eos> Well, I know this...<eos> I will not murder for pleasure.<eos> Without a full feed, she will fail The Dawning.<eos> She will devolve.<eos> She will die.<eos> She will surprise the shit out of you.<eos> And you know, you'd think I'd get tired of watching, but...<eos> I never do.<eos> And I never will.
Okay.<eos> Golden opportunity.<eos> For what?<eos> Little kid and a woman.<eos> Ask them for a hand, get a hold of those weapons.<eos> - What?<eos> - We do it quick, they'll never know what hit them.<eos> - No. Whoa, whoa.<eos> - We're out here to bury Donna.<eos> And we will, after.
Sarah, God has spoken to me.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Lot, my nephew, walk with us.<eos> Abraham?<eos> He will lead us to a new home.<eos> But... we have a home, a good home.<eos> Away from the city to a new land... for our children.<eos> But you have no children.<eos> You can never have children.<eos> But we will.
Well, I was the voice of the spirits of St. Louis of the A.B.A. back in 1974.<eos> Huh, I spent the last ten years building a robot arm that goes dvvvft, dvvvft.<eos> Now I have to be brave enough to ask, "what's next?"<eos> You know, I can relate to that.<eos> Here I am with a new show, and yet I'm talking about sports.<eos> There's so much more I could talk about...<eos> Philosophy, poetry, music, nanotechnology.<eos> I'd watch that show.<eos> I could do that show.<eos> But you won't.
I think this was always gonna be a big mistake.<eos> I'm sorry, Martha, but let's go.<eos> Uh, thanks for the cookies, Dad.<eos> I can't deny it's an interesting area.<eos> Interesting?<eos> Yeah, I've been looking into it.<eos> Did you know that... if you take every single person killed in a terrorist act around the world in the last 20 years and you add to that all the lives lost in the Middle East since 1967, the Six Day War, and you add to that every single American life lost in Vietnam, in Korea, and in every single American engagement since then...<eos> Iraq, Afghanistan... if you take all those lives and you multiply it by two, that's the number of children that die of malaria every single year.<eos> So are you saying you'll help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
♪ oh, girls, they wanna have fun ♪ You should take this, Carrie.<eos> ♪ oh, girls, they... I think Dorrit should have it.<eos> Mom always loved you in green.<eos> ♪ oh, girls, they... It's the losing of love that makes us who we are--<eos> The loss of a parent.<eos> ♪ oh, girls, they...<eos> ♪ those girls, they... Who you thought you might be...<eos> Nobody saw you, right?<eos> 'cause if your dad found out...<eos> He won't.
I'll take a pen and paper, if you have one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eric, what in God's name are you doing?<eos> Giving you back your home.<eos> I'll put the official deed to the house in the mail.<eos> It's not much.<eos> But it's the least I can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stay away from Bill.<eos> I will.
Not that me and your mom are having any sleepovers.<eos> Please, mom?<eos> Look, it'll be fine.<eos> I promise, he's in great hands.<eos> What? It's the circus, kid.<eos> What? Uh, Shawn, I thought that you said we were going to the Le Cirque show.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is a dress rehearsal.<eos> Yes, but we promised Max that he would be seeing the show.<eos> And he will. Just without all the unnecessary excitement and entertainment.
Mas Oyama Dies<eos> It's perfectly natural.<eos> He's human after all.<eos> But...not of cancer!<eos> How would you like him to have died?<eos> What do you mean...?<eos> Listen.<eos> We all die.<eos> I will die.<eos> Someday you will too.
Until I guaranteed that you would finish the job!<eos> Why would you do such a dumb-ass thing?<eos> ! - Because I trust you...<eos> - I never asked you to!<eos> Do you remember who we're dealing with?<eos> If you betray him, there is not a place in this world that his freaky little minions will not find you!<eos> Or you.<eos> Finish the job, Tamsin.<eos> Deliver the Succubus.<eos> Or I will.
Don't let me down.<eos> Win and Diesel's worth big bucks.<eos> Lose and he's worth nowt.<eos> Get off my car.<eos> - Get in. - He'll just keep money from race, you know.<eos> How's that gonna get your mum out of debt?<eos> You're just lining his pockets, you know, Swifty.<eos> He's using you.<eos> We won't be able to move this.<eos> - Course we will.
- You didn't have to do that.<eos> - It was there.<eos> Plus, it was worth it to see Adam's cock. Whoa!<eos> - What?<eos> I know those were your rooster boxers.<eos> Uh, there are multiple roosters, so it would be "cocks."<eos> - I'll drive.<eos> - No, you will not.<eos> - No!<eos> - No, you will not.
No.<eos> You know, um, can you help me?<eos> How old are you really, Phillip?<eos> 16... almost.<eos> But I've always felt like an old soul.<eos> Mm.<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah. You-- you mustn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no.<eos> I won't.
You know, um, can you help me?<eos> How old are you really, Phillip?<eos> 16... almost.<eos> But I've always felt like an old soul.<eos> Mm.<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah. You-- you mustn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
I have needs, Frank. I have needs.<eos> I don't think I ask for too much.<eos> - I don't know what to do. - Oh, no.<eos> Please, don't cry when I'm eating.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just- - I miss it. I miss it so, so much and the missing makes me sad.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Really?<eos> You will?
I don't want that to be the last thing that she sees of me, Mum.<eos> I want her to know that... I wanted her to know that her dad can give her something.<eos> She's not leaving the country.<eos> Well, she might as well be, mightn't she?<eos> When will you... have the money?<eos> I'll have it this afternoon.<eos> I'll make sure she's here.<eos> Richard... Yeah, I know.<eos> I know, and I won't.<eos> I won't.
You lived for my sake only. My entire life is yours.<eos> Forget everything and forgive me, Chitra.<eos> I can't live without you.<eos> Let's not stay here anymore.<eos> Let's go elsewhere and live happily!<eos> Say yes!<eos> Bloody rascal! If you want to go, you go alone! Why are you asking her to come?<eos> I'll beat you. You ruined my mother's life for your drinks. Yes, I did ruin her life.<eos> You suspected my birth too. Are you planning to ruin her life too?<eos> Yes, I will!
Thank you, Mr Edwards.<eos> I see why Harry has you as a friend.<eos> He'll come through all this.<eos> Mother, you should get some sleep.<eos> If Pa wakes, I'll tell you.<eos> No, I wanna be here when he does.<eos> You know what the doctor said.<eos> When Pa wakes up, if he wakes up...<eos> Stop it, Rosalie!<eos> Of course he will.
I've another appointment.<eos> I assume you'll want to see the work I've done on our opera?<eos> I've no time.<eos> We've established the movement of Lithuanian artists.<eos> It is to resurrect folk art.<eos> We're organizing an exhibition.<eos> If you would come, I would be thankful.<eos> I don't think I will have time.<eos> Well, you're obviously not interested in learning about your own culture.<eos> Maybe I will.
- She was always trying to get your attention.<eos> All you had to do was watch her, and you couldn't even do that.<eos> You walked away to take a phone call.<eos> It was 30 seconds.<eos> She wasn't in the pool.<eos> I was gone for 30 seconds.<eos> You know, I never asked you, but did you make that deal?<eos> Did you get that contract, Scott?<eos> You keep trying to forgive yourself.<eos> I never will.
And then he came home. And he needed help.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He killed himself because no one gave a damn.<eos> So everything that we talked about, our... our plans and having a family... none of it was ever going to happen.<eos> He lost his life.<eos> And I lost everything.<eos> But his sacrifice won't be forgotten.<eos> Killing people isn't going to bring your husband back.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
And victims can sometimes broadcast victimhood involuntarily.<eos> Not me.<eos> That's not necessarily true.<eos> Your victimhood has a high profile.<eos> celebrity victim.<eos> Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
I do understand women really well.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This house has bad vibes, you have to move out.<eos> Uncle, we just moved in.<eos> You have to move out before anything happens.<eos> Hubby, I gotta go.<eos> No...<eos> Listen, you have to move out.<eos> We won't.
You chose to associate with a low sort, Whitehead!<eos> He's injured.<eos> He lies some 70-odd yards or so yonder.<eos> - Is that to say we are still friends?<eos> - No! We're not!<eos> You may still catch your quarry single-handed.<eos> There, now you're a soldier.<eos> I am no soldier.<eos> Will he find you running away?<eos> He will not, sir.
You could've been paralyzed.<eos> Whoever did this to you doesn't deserve your protection.<eos> Maybe you don't understand the severity of your situation.<eos> The severity of my situation?<eos> We met when we were 14.<eos> We've been together for 30 years.<eos> My husband is a part of me.<eos> I can't separate myself from him no more than I can cut off an arm or a leg.<eos> I just want him to stop.<eos> He won't, not on his own.
And I'll lose my job. I just...<eos> I just got this great job and I have nothing in my life besides this job.<eos> - I'll talk to the...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm going to sign the release.<eos> Worst decision that you'll ever make.<eos> She says she'll be happy.<eos> Right now she doesn't need to be happy.<eos> She needs to stop using.<eos> And she will.
Carrie Bradshaw, when I look at you, I see myself years ago when my power was pure and young.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> But I was foolish. I sold my power.<eos> I relinquished my vagina.<eos> Learn from my mistakes, Carrie Bradshaw.<eos> Never let a man...<eos> Any man...<eos> Make your decisions.<eos> I won't.
Monica Penny had seen something in me... something strong.<eos> And maybe it was nuts, defining myself by what a retired porn star thought of me, but she made me realize that if I didn't define who I was and what I wanted, somebody else would.<eos> And what I wanted was Sebastian.<eos> And no man, not even my father, could stop me.<eos> You know, I actually think I prefer him this way.<eos> He's more interesting.<eos> I just wish I could have found morrissey.<eos> I know I'll never see him again.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you will.
Naughty stuff?<eos> No. No Nudie Judies.<eos> Time to say goodbye.<eos> It might be a while till you can visit, fiancé.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too!<eos> - I'll call you as soon as I can. - Okay. Okay?<eos> Please send that check immediately.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Oh, I don't have a ride, so I'm taking your car.<eos> ♪ Okay, Ruby Tuesday Taylor, part two.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, kiddo, how you doing?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> Well, you sleep tight, all right?<eos> - I'll see you when you wake up.<eos> - Okay. But... Will I see you?<eos> Of course you will.
Okay, so, couch time and... Yes! ...I will get some popcorn.<eos> I'm glad to have you back.<eos> I genuinely missed you.<eos> Before you say anything, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry that I attacked you at the reception.<eos> It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous.<eos> Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
This is our biggest one. Huh? Ever.<eos> After that, we'll stop, huh?<eos> Like we always wanted.<eos> Put your mask back on.<eos> I'm not an idiot, Yan.<eos> Here, some food.<eos> I don't want any. You have to eat.<eos> After we make the ransom video, your father will pay, then you can go home.<eos> He isn't going to pay anything for me.<eos> He will.
Yes, right there.<eos> Or an "S." Self-published author.<eos> Did you eat enough dinner?<eos> I don't love vegetables.<eos> Seemed like you didn't really love dessert tonight, either.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Usually my favorite part about dinner is dessert, and my favorite dessert is pudding, and my favorite pudding flavor is chocolate, but my absolute favorite part of chocolate pudding is the skin, and tonight's pudding was skinless.<eos> But don't tell our mom.<eos> I don't want to hurt her feelings.<eos> It won't.
I'm better now.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - I did.<eos> They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
You will address me as Sister Jude.<eos> You don't fool me, Kit Walker.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> Killer of women.<eos> Jude, please...<eos> No, you get away!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> I won't go back in that hole!<eos> I will not!
Killer of women.<eos> Jude, please...<eos> No, you get away!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> I won't go back in that hole!<eos> I will not!<eos> - You can't make me!<eos> - Thomas!<eos> Get your sister and go outside.<eos> I will not!
- Change of heart?<eos> I thought you didn't believe in monsters.<eos> - Bleeding is believing.<eos> - What, so you're just running away?<eos> As soon as the sun comes up, as fast as I fucking can.<eos> But Gerri's taken Amy to her home, to Cachtice Castle.<eos> I think she's gonna kill her!<eos> I wish I could help, kid.<eos> - You can!<eos> - But I won't.
Look at your sweet face.<eos> This is awful. What happened?<eos> I don't even know, Mom.<eos> We just don't get along.<eos> He's gonna have to leave.<eos> He can't come into our lives and disrupt them like this.<eos> He can't talk to us the way he does.<eos> And he can't hurt you.<eos> I will not stand for it.<eos> I won't.
It's just until the parents come round.<eos> How's that little miracle going to happen? Hmm?<eos> And how, pray tell, is you doing everything for the child helping the parents?<eos> Appeasing your own guilt, are you?<eos> I have no idea what you mean.<eos> I saw your face when that child was born.<eos> You were distraught, Nurse Lee, as every midwife has been before you.<eos> God help us, we're only human.<eos> But your guilt will not help the mother to bond.<eos> What will?
Sure. I'll make sure she gets them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, again, I'm really sorry.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> Uh, okay. I'll be right there.<eos> Selena, you need to get in your uniform right now.<eos> Well, out of all the spas in all the world, You guys got to walk into mine.<eos> And for good reason.<eos> The money from the stolen wire still hasn't turned up.<eos> Maybe it never will.
What would I even say?<eos> Say no, that's what.<eos> Tansy, it's one night out.<eos> With my ex-husband and Zoe Hart, who I just don't find that much fun, and... when you're with her, I'm sorry, but neither are you.<eos> Yes, I am. I'm fun.<eos> (chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine. I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
I guess we'll take this table.<eos> We're good here.<eos> You're... really good at that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a little scary.<eos> Can be.<eos> "Foreign Accent Syndrome"?<eos> No, man, that's not a thing.<eos> It's hard to believe, I know, but you can look it up.<eos> Oh, I will.
Are you sure that's what he said,<eos> "you're gonna regret this"?<eos> I'm very confident.<eos> I've been doing this professionally for 20 years.<eos> Thank you, Meryl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So Steve Owen said that Skylar wasn't just interested in Tommy, she was practically stalking him.<eos> Right. So he was trying to get her to back off.<eos> She won't.
They found six crates of counterfeit cigarettes in our airing cupboard.<eos> He was a gobshite, that magistrate.<eos> Could've just let me off with a slap on the wrist, with a community service.<eos> He would've if you hadn't taken the piss out of his hair.<eos> He didn't like that, did he?<eos> Old Donald Trump.<eos> Dad...<eos> I'm getting married in six weeks and you promised.<eos> You promised that when I walk down that aisle, I'll be holding on to your arm.<eos> And you will.
You don't have a chance.<eos> Captain Renard, what can you tell us about the masked bank robbers?<eos> The arrests have been made, and the fugitives are being brought into the precinct now.<eos> We will have to wait for confirmation of identities.<eos> - Captain Renard, do you...<eos> - They're coming in.<eos> We're just the beginning of what's coming.<eos> You tell them, babe.<eos> You'll never be able to stop it now.<eos> Nobody will.
You supplied her?<eos> Well, I wasn't good enough.<eos> Um, it's always a difficult situation.<eos> The department decided to take things in a new direction.<eos> Well, I tried my best.<eos> Your contribution won't go unnoticed, Vera.<eos> You will be reinstated as deputy.<eos> You're going to make a career change. Do I make myself clear?<eos> - What if it gets out?<eos> - It won't.
Morning.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Come on. - Oh.<eos> Belt.<eos> You're late.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> This is the first and last time, Jacs.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, you will.
Yes, Governor.<eos> You just disappeared.<eos> Anything could have happened.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Are you gonna tell me?<eos> Tell you what?<eos> What was so important that it required your immediate attention?<eos> - It was a mistake.<eos> - You pull something like that again...<eos> I won't.
I'll tell you what happened.<eos> This stupid merger.<eos> It's bad enough my vote is worth 1/3 of what it was last week. Now our uni-balls, gone.<eos> Our...<eos> What? Pens, Donna.<eos> The new quartermaster,<eos> Barbara L. Tottingham, will not buy us any more uni-balls.<eos> There's not one single uni-ball in this entire firm.<eos> - Please stop saying uni-ball.<eos> - No, I will not.
I love you.<eos> I miss you every day, but I will always be with you.<eos> I will always be with you.<eos> I promise.<eos> And now I'm going to let you go.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, Sam.<eos> A lot of truth there.<eos> - But you didn't let him go.<eos> - No, I never will.
This is my journey.<eos> I'm afraid it's something I have to do alone.<eos> I know.<eos> There's a fearsome beast ravaging a faraway kingdom.<eos> Its eyes burn with fire.<eos> They call it the yaoguai.<eos> No man has been able to kill it, but we will.<eos> There's room on our wagon.<eos> Now who's gonna join us?<eos> Here. I will.
I'm sorry, Tino.<eos> I know you want to protect your kid, but these guys...<eos> they don't play nice.<eos> All right, thanks, Al. Message received.<eos> He couldn't do anything, could he?<eos> Look, it's not over, kid.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> Sit down and relax.<eos> You said you could fix this.<eos> And I will.
We need to talk.<eos> *** Edwards had your back and you threw him under the bus.<eos> My stance on public corruption -- Is a joke, especially when you're at the heart of it.<eos> That's a serious accusation.<eos> I'm aware of your situation, Mr. Caffrey, your background, your father.<eos> What about my father?<eos> Keep it together, Neal.<eos> You accuse me of corruption when, in fact, it was James Bennett who was the real stain on Metro PD -- a criminal posing as a cop.<eos> I'm sure you, of all people, can appreciate the irony.<eos> Oh, I will.
You kept it.<eos> The things you do... mean something to people.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I couldn't fix it.<eos> Fix what?<eos> Ricki will never see her grandpa again.<eos> But you did good.<eos> You gave her your rabbit.<eos> She won't forget that, Abby.<eos> She won't.
And that's what I have to say.<eos> And just think about it.<eos> And then come find me.<eos> Sarah, I need you to bless this as a dress shoe.<eos> So your sister Julia will think of it as a dress shoe. - Dad, I-- - She's never gonna buy that...<eos> - And you're the older sister.<eos> - as a dress shoe.<eos> She'll listen to you, Sarah.<eos> She doesn't listen to me.<eos> - Yes, she will.
No, I do. I do like it, but...<eos> Shelby, look, we need to talk.<eos> I get it.<eos> You are the respected town doctor, and you can't have people talking, and as much fun as we're having, this is gonna have to come to an end.<eos> It's a shame because I got all this new lingerie, and I wanted to surprise you, but... well...<eos> Good-bye, brick.<eos> Hey, uh, who said anything about... about this ending?<eos> What do I care... about what people think?<eos> I'm an adult, and we are having an adult relationship, so if I want to do this...<eos> I damn well will!
Okay, you see the tip?<eos> You see that?<eos> Push it in.<eos> Now, when that releases, the drill stops automatically.<eos> Now, look at me.<eos> You need to start right here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Steady.<eos> Promise me it will stop.<eos> It will.
Lawyer.<eos> You know, girlfriends hear a lot of personal business.<eos> - Lawyer. - You sure?<eos> I assume you, uh...<eos> You use the same counsel that your boss keeps on retainer, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't want that getting back to him either.<eos> He knows we trumped this up.<eos> Yep. And he can go right to Bello and tell him that the FBI knows more than they should.<eos> Yep. But he won't because...
She totally wants me.<eos> I'd give her a ride.<eos> Oh, yeah, man, me, too.<eos> Wherever she needs to go.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Bug man on campus, huh?<eos> Yeah, the biggest. I don't think you got the cojones to go for it.<eos> Sure do.<eos> Cojones grande.<eos> Yeah, I will.
It didn't make any sense.<eos> When I saw that burning wreck of a car, I... never felt so powerless.<eos> A few days later,<eos> I buried you...<eos> My only child...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
But you're a newsagent.<eos> I sell 'em.<eos> I don't want to be in 'em.<eos> Why?<eos> Don't get smart.<eos> I'm just trying to find out about Danny.<eos> He did a newspaper round for you, didn't he?<eos> Are you gonna leave nicely or do I have to ring the police?<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
It's not dangerous, is it?<eos> It's 100% risk-free.<eos> - We're ready, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> She's under.<eos> I'm just going to work. I'll see you tonight.<eos> Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.
It's 100% risk-free.<eos> - We're ready, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> She's under.<eos> I'm just going to work. I'll see you tonight.<eos> Not if I survive the procedure.<eos> This is going to turn out just like that day.<eos> We're never going to see each other again.<eos> We Will.<eos> Of course we will.
I've got some meetings with JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs.<eos> So you must be what they call in business a businessman.<eos> Yeah, I trade derivatives, mostly currency swaps for institutional clients, and I do a little merger arbitrage on the side.<eos> Do you work out?<eos> P90X every day.<eos> You got a boyfriend?<eos> I mean, I know it ain't this guy.<eos> Right?<eos> Anyway, maybe we'll go out for drinks tonight?<eos> Yeah, we will.
Kyle, I got you a lawyer and I paid your bail because I wanted to get you out of here.<eos> But we really can't keep having this conversation.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry... for everything.<eos> I want you to know how much I appreciate all that you've done.<eos> Uh, here.<eos> Kids made that for you.<eos> That thing in there is a donkey.<eos> Travis is big on donkeys these days.<eos> Tell him I love him.<eos> I will.
Yeah-no, I've just never been this happy to get back a positive test, you know?<eos> What does my sister see in you? Half-pint.<eos> Before I forget, there was this little hottie asking for you back at the station earlier.<eos> And you seem surprised, why?<eos> Said she'd come by later. They always come back for more.<eos> Hey.<eos> Any word on Deb?<eos> Yeah, Dr. Vogel says she's still day-to-day.<eos> Let her know I was thinking about her.<eos> I will.
And I thought it was causing your-- your violent episodes.<eos> I-I was only trying to make you better.<eos> Well, it worked really well, didn't it?<eos> You're a hell of a doctor!<eos> I only wanted what was best for you.<eos> I still do.<eos> That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me.<eos> I had no choice. You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.
I know.<eos> I threw them out the window when I met you because my life was on the line.<eos> Now the threat is over.<eos> And you're bringing another threat into your life.<eos> It's my work.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
I just hope she doesn't like Sam more than she likes Walden.<eos> Why would she?<eos> Well, a lot of reasons.<eos> One, Sam's better in bed. What?<eos> He tries harder.<eos> He has to compensate for all the other things he doesn't have.<eos> He's banging scared.<eos> If that's true, I'd be the best lay on the planet.<eos> I just don't want to lose her.<eos> Oh, you won't.
- Kendrick?<eos> - He's the only person at the CIA who knows about Division.<eos> He's committed to keeping it a secret.<eos> He wouldn't just send some random agent out to deliver it.<eos> It would have to be him.<eos> Amanda targeting the Director of the CIA?<eos> That's a little crazy, even for her.<eos> Amanda targeting our closest ally in the government-- it's not so crazy.<eos> We need to get those files.<eos> We will.
See, I-I have this amazing woman in my life that's been shaking things up.<eos> Wow. He is distractingly handsome.<eos> I might just forget my lyrics.<eos> Just think about ovulation.<eos> It'll kill the mood.<eos> Oh, that's true.<eos> Well, as your manager, I insist you concentrate.<eos> Okay. Uh, excuse me.<eos> Riley made you her manager?<eos> Yes, she will.
You mean the Montego Bay Police Department?<eos> That is such a good idea.<eos> They're such good listeners.<eos> What are you gonna tell them?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm Jason Cole.<eos> Then I'll kill you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need a drug to do it.<eos> I will.
It's a pattern. It's what it's all about.<eos> Okay, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna release the trustees, but I'll have an agent sit on each of their homes.<eos> Rigsby, you take Jason Lennon.<eos> Cho, you take Kevin Rome.<eos> I'll have Karl sit on Stephen Doppler's hotel.<eos> I'll take Melissa Enfield.<eos> We'll be in radio contact the entire time.<eos> If Lorelei tries to go after one of them--<eos> She will.
The same guy who has you stealing jewelry did this to holly.<eos> He uses kids like you.<eos> And then he just gets to walk away while you have to sit in here and answer all my questions.<eos> You know what you are to him right now?<eos> You're a loose end.<eos> So take a hard look, because this is your future.<eos> This is you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> He won't.
That being said,<eos> I'd like my lawyer. I need a minute alone.<eos> You tipped off Shane.<eos> After you bolted last night, you called him.<eos> Warned him that he was a suspect, which gave him a chance to torch his car.<eos> Cover up his role in holly's death.<eos> Congratulations, Joey.<eos> You helped him get away with murder.<eos> Now I'd beat your skinny little ass for being so stupid if it'd change anything.<eos> But it won't because, well...
Where is Cristina?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I keep texting her. She would say yes to this.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> Oh, get some sleep.<eos> This isn't all on your shoulders.<eos> It shouldn't be.<eos> It is right now. If I can't, you know, if I can't talk the nurses into staying...<eos> You will.
So silly of me!<eos> The injection will be in your bottom.<eos> Very good.<eos> And that should have you up and moving about very soon.<eos> Well, hello!<eos> Hello!<eos> Ladies.<eos> So, what are you a doctor of... gorgeousity?<eos> Do get in touch if it's not eased off by the morning.<eos> Certainly will, ha-ha!
Is the park open?<eos> Not yet!<eos> You call that kissing a baby?<eos> !<eos> That's how you kiss a baby.<eos> I hereby declare this Stabby Eye Day!<eos> Oh, Adam, I'm so sorry!<eos> Carol, I love you and I can't live without you.<eos> Please, never let this happen again.<eos> I won't, Adam.
Free drugs.<eos> Who are you, eh?<eos> I'm going to say this once.<eos> Do not try to be something you are not.<eos> I was just looking out for you, sir.<eos> We don't know where they dropped it.<eos> The ocean is big.<eos> What if I knew someone who specialized in just that sort of thing?<eos> I'd say I didn't know you if the wrong people found out.<eos> They won't.
- That's actually fairly impressive.<eos> - You have no idea. With that city council?<eos> Ron this isn't a car dealership, The same principle!<eos> You build it, hire people you trust to manage it.<eos> - Yeah, ha. ...and then you collect the fruits of their labor!<eos> Because don't, please, don't take this the wrong way, babe - but you're not getting any younger.<eos> - You said a rocket launcher?<eos> - I did. I did say a rocket launcher.<eos> - Then give this to whosits.<eos> - I will.
- Ew. - I don't...<eos> - Tease.<eos> - ... and I'm sorry for that one...<eos> - Don't be. ...because I'm just gonna say it, I think it's suuuper creepy you get sexually aroused by physical violence.<eos> Well but also emotional violence.<eos> That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Wh-? Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
I am their queen.<eos> You did just slaughter an entire village.<eos> Maybe that's why they call you The Evil Queen.<eos> But I am not evil.<eos> They call me that because of her.<eos> She's the evil one.<eos> They're her people, dearie.<eos> You're gonna have to be content with their fear.<eos> They'll never love you.<eos> Yes, they will.
- right before Valentine's Day. - I'm sorry!<eos> Really, I don't know what else to say.<eos> Well, thanks a lot.<eos> Now I don't have a date to the dance.<eos> I hate you!<eos> Wait a sec.<eos> There's a lot of guys wanting to get out of relationships before Valentine's Day, right?<eos> That way, they can avoid spending all that money and taking things to the next level.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - I will.
You call me whatever you want.<eos> - Thanks, Dr. Cole.<eos> - You got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was hoping to get your signature on something.<eos> It's a letter of recommendation.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I feel awful even asking.<eos> It's like I'm cheating on you, but the best Doctor Young could do is put me back in the temp pool until I get a new boss.<eos> And you will...
It's all right, Lana.<eos> Lana?<eos> You want to go sit down, watch some TV?<eos> You'll be able to see dad from there, hmm?<eos> Everything's gonna be fine. Go.<eos> We better keep an eye on her.<eos> We're not going to hurt her or you.<eos> We just need to know what we need to know.<eos> Clients-- I talk about 'em, they come back and make sure I can't talk again.<eos> This one won't.
What happened to your scar?<eos> What?<eos> The scar on your neck from the mountain bike crash.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Oh.<eos> Really?<eos> I-I'm using a new lotion.<eos> Let me see.<eos> You will try anything, won't you?<eos> I will.
Seems he's taken a page from your manual on how to disappear without a trace.<eos> You don't think he'd go after the Initiative on his own?<eos> They just murdered his sister.<eos> At this point, I don't know what he'll do.<eos> Anything on Padma?<eos> Oh, no communication there yet either, but believe me, I've got eyes and ears all over that one.<eos> If they make contact, I'll know.<eos> Whatever you do, you cannot let Padma know<eos> - that you're on to her.<eos> - I won't.
I doubt that it's organically grown.<eos> Hah! Doubt it's grown at all.<eos> You bring me here and you risk my life, and you expect there to be no consequences?<eos> That's what's wrong with this military and this country.<eos> You're lecturing us on right and wrong.<eos> The agent who died because of you had a wife and a six-year-old son.<eos> And you think this is the justice that they were looking for?<eos> No, but it prevents others from needing to seek justice at all.<eos> This must end.<eos> It won't.
Hey, baby. You got me freaking.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I can't be mixed up in some murder cult.<eos> What are you crazy? The word cult is ghastly inappropriate and offends me.<eos> We're more of a family.<eos> Hmm. I do not have time for that.<eos> I have two bondage parties tonight.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Get rid of it. Oh. How about you help me out to the car?<eos> No, I won't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Why didn't you go with them?<eos> Needed a siesta.<eos> - You gave up, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't give up.<eos> I just realized... You can't control everything... No matter how hard you try.<eos> Let's just say I made peace with that fact.<eos> Peace?<eos> You love Elena.<eos> You always will.
Then I'll go with you.<eos> Aaron, I have a family.<eos> That sergeant I stabbed, he was coming after my daughter.<eos> She's 11.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she is.<eos> My family got to Texas. They're, uh... waiting for me.<eos> Well, then, you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know... I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
I have to talk to him.<eos> You're not gonna just talk to him, mom, let's be honest.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do, but he can't get away with it! - 'Cause everybody always gets away with everything!<eos> - He's not going to!<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> I promise you, mother. We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I mean, she's been through a lot, you know.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - We have to give her - some time to recover, and...<eos> - We can't.<eos> That guy's gonna realize she's gone, and then what?<eos> He's totally dangerous.<eos> He needs to be locked up.<eos> You know, I say we call the FBI right this second.<eos> We're not gonna do that, Emma.<eos> But don't we have to move quickly?<eos> Yes, and... and we will, honey, we will.
Leslie, it's okay.<eos> Oh, my God. You did all this?<eos> How did you get food?<eos> I had a classic stroke of Haverford genius.<eos> Who has the most to lose from a new Paunch Burger?<eos> Their competitors.<eos> I got all the other fast-food places in town to donate food.<eos> I know black tie and chicky tenders isn't the best mix,<eos> - but-- - No, Tom, I love it.<eos> And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens.
Where is Holmes?<eos> That's pathetic.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Now you hit me.<eos> Seriously? What is your damage?<eos> Look, given that you were held at gunpoint in this very room little over a week ago, I thought, perhaps, a test of your ability to defend yourself was in order.<eos> It was.<eos> You have much to learn about the art of self-preservation.<eos> Okay, if you ever do that again, I swear...<eos> You'll what?
I'm holding court with the Porters as we speak.<eos> Your story and Jack's aren't exactly matching up.<eos> Oh, well, that's because, as always, the wife is the source of the issue, leaving the husband blissfully ignorant of the mess he'll have to answer for.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you telling me that Amanda's the one that's got your neck in a vice, not Jack?<eos> What I'm telling you is that girl is in possession of a laptop that belongs to me.<eos> Now if you can return it intact, I'll see to it that your own ambitions are rewarded far beyond your current ability to imagine.<eos> Uh, Mr. Ryan, I will need assurances that she has neither the intention nor the ability to ever come after me again.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> She won't.
Her first job after WITSEC that moved her to New York has this employer I.D. number here -<eos> Private security firm.<eos> Perfect way to satisfy her inner cop.<eos> And one of their clients was a tech startup in the Empire State Building.<eos> That's got to be it.<eos> Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
Oh my -- you asshole!<eos> Was he crushed?<eos> ! Probably woulda been. If I'd told him about it.<eos> Ugh. But wait, why did Corelli hire ISIS to prevent the assassination?<eos> To show the cardinals he was trying to prevent it, all the while assuming- What, that we'd totally bl-ow my God he assumed we'd totally blow it?<eos> !<eos> Well... ISIS has a certain reputation.<eos> Hey, whoa! Not cool, Payne Stewart!<eos> Oh, my God, if Malory ever hears about this -<eos> Which she won't!
You do realize we're working on a gender-discrimination case.<eos> That's what I'm doing-- working.<eos> And hopefully that's what you'll be doing now too.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Welcome to the team, hottie.<eos> We're consolidating resources.<eos> Jessica didn't approve the investigator?<eos> Jessica approved anything we want, for one case.<eos> What? No, we have to fight them all.<eos> And we will.
Edward!<eos> Leave us.<eos> George has just accused me publicly of witchcraft!<eos> He is spreading rumours that his wife was poisoned and I was the one who did it.<eos> George is angry because he cannot have the wife he wants.<eos> He just asked me for Mary of Burgundy but I said no.<eos> Imagine what would happen if we let him loose with Flanders!<eos> He is accusing me of murder, Edward!<eos> And if you're not going to do anything about it, then<eos> I most certainly will.
My grandfather. Carved the handle himself.<eos> Took it with him to Korea.<eos> When he made it back in one piece, that made the knife a good-luck charm.<eos> So when my dad shipped out for Vietnam he took it with him.<eos> He made it back home too. Which made the damn thing miracle-lucky.<eos> Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this. I...<eos> I don't want this.<eos> One day maybe your son will.
I mean, if... If she wasn't the one they were after and she's just in the way--<eos> Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive.<eos> Whatever their motives, the kidnappers will realize she has value.<eos> Now what we need to do next is go to your home and set up a trap and trace on your phone lines so we're ready for their call.<eos> I'll wait for you outside.<eos> Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
You tell me.<eos> I work for you as long as you'll have me.<eos> I apologise, Will.<eos> I know you've got my back.<eos> I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
Why don't you sneak your camera into the courthouse?<eos> Part 35, fourth floor.<eos> Take a picture of the defendant. Put that out there.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because he's a child molester who may walk because your idiotic crusade scared off the main witness.<eos> Yeah, well, not everybody does the Reagan bidding.<eos> Really? That's all you have?<eos> Miss Reagan?<eos> You try taking my picture again, I will shove that camera...<eos> Hey, he won't.
I'm not gonna let that happen, Sean.<eos> Yolanda?<eos> No, you won't, Ray.<eos> You know why?<eos> Look at her.<eos> She's so innocent.<eos> So pure.<eos> She's my little angel.<eos> You can't let anyone hurt my family, Ray.<eos> I won't.
Yet.<eos> If we are ordered to open fire, I want us all to be there.<eos> Gum?<eos> Sure.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> We did not do anything, there is room for everyone.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> What does he want?<eos> I do not understand!<eos> This will.
You got it?<eos> Control, alt, delete.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sweetheart, are you all right?<eos> How's little Carl?<eos> Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
You're right, Castle.<eos> It does change how I see you.<eos> It makes me like you just a little bit more.<eos> Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.<eos> Oh, so now you remember his name.<eos> Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
You'll never get him to talk.<eos> I have powers of persuasion, don't you worry.<eos> If you arrest him now, you'll just have him to show for it.<eos> But if you wait, there's still a chance you can catch the whole gang.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Kev's on his way over here now.<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> If he doesn't know you're following him, he'll lead you straight to 'em.<eos> What makes you think he'll lead me anywhere other than his mum's house?<eos> He won't. He won't.
We'll never know.<eos> If one day, I screw up... and they order you to kill me.<eos> You should still do it.<eos> It's just work, nothing personal.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Come on! You'll never screw up.<eos> But you are going to kill me?<eos> You cocksucker!<eos> Fuckit I won't.<eos> I won't.
- I can't.<eos> So why can't you sleep?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Don't make me sorry for taking you to the movies.<eos> No.<eos> I just keep thinking...<eos> What if somebody shoots henry?<eos> No one's gonna do that.<eos> - But they could.<eos> - But they won't.
Okay?<eos> You'll start your mornings with prednisolone and mycophenolate at 8:00 A.M.<eos> Then follow that with, uh, fk-506 at 10:00 A.M.<eos> and 10:00 P.M.... those are for every day.<eos> Then you'll also be on trimethoprim-sulfa three times a week.<eos> Now you're just making up words.<eos> Look, you have to take them no matter what, all right?<eos> Or you'll lose the kidney.<eos> You can't miss a dose.<eos> She won't.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Cee Io's a patient now, but don't get excited.<eos> He's just a regular guy like anybody else.<eos> Puts his pants on one leg at a time.<eos> Yeah, but his pants are gold lamé and they cost a million dollars.<eos> I gotta meet him, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I know, but you're never gonna meet him.<eos> But I really have to.<eos> Oh, that's different.<eos> You never will.
Maybe he didn't know any better.<eos> Well, he should know better than to run.<eos> I didn't want to shoot him.<eos> Just like you didn't want to shoot Ned Harris.<eos> All right, just shut up.<eos> I need to, uh...<eos> I need to think.<eos> Well, think about this. One more dead body isn't gonna solve any of your problems, Harry.<eos> No?<eos> Maybe three more will.
Well, something I need to say to you.<eos> I've sensed your disapproval since I got back in town.<eos> The fact is, I deserve it. I do.<eos> I get carried away, and I... I take things too far sometimes.<eos> But I want the same things you do.<eos> Well, that may be true, but I don't believe in ruining people's lives to get it.<eos> Katherine, if my methods have caused you to waver in your support, then I want to apologize to you<eos> Listen, victory in this town without... without you by my side is just gonna mean so much less.<eos> So, I can do things differently.<eos> And I will.
Even if we could pull that off, all we can prove is that Cliff was at the club.<eos> That doesn't guarantee a conviction.<eos> Well, if I can't put him in jail, I'll put him in the ground.<eos> The gun that J.R. gave me. I want it.<eos> I know what it's for.<eos> - That's not what it's for.<eos> - Then, damn it, Uncle Bobby, you tell me what it's for!<eos> He killed your brother, my father!<eos> We cannot let him get away with this!<eos> And we won't.
Okay. But... the shell casing is made of yellow brass.<eos> Well, why didn't it melt?<eos> Yellow brass has a melting point of 905 degrees Celsius.<eos> So the temperature was greater than 865 degrees, but less than 905 degrees.<eos> So... what?<eos> Angie, at these temperatures, a human body would've been completely reduced to ash in three hours.<eos> So either the temperature of the fire wasn't that hot or it burned for a much shorter period of time.<eos> Yeah, about half the time.<eos> Listen, I'm not gonna be insulted if you run a simulation and check my math, but...<eos> Oh, I will.
Look, we've already found it, you idiot.<eos> That is the source of the Nile.<eos> "This is not the source of the Nile."<eos> It is.<eos> "The source of the Nile is still disputed.<eos> "The Victorians thought it was Lake Victoria,<eos> "but today we know this huge body of water is fed by many rivers.<eos> "One of them is the true source, and even today, in 2012,<eos> "experts have not been able to determine which it is.<eos> "You will."
Just see you soon.<eos> - See you soon.<eos> - See you soon!<eos> - See you soon.<eos> - See you soon!<eos> Baby.<eos> We'll call you when we get settled in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go heal my baby.<eos> I will.
Then I'll ask him straight out to dismiss his valet.<eos> I won't say why.<eos> That makes me so nervous.<eos> Don't be.<eos> No-one needs to know the reason.<eos> Green simply won't be back at Downton again.<eos> Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham as to why he has a different valet?<eos> I suppose not.<eos> So you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit.<eos> And will he, m'lady?
How could I have done that?<eos> That... Maybe somebody left it on my desk here, and...<eos> Is this Grace's history?<eos> How would I know?<eos> I don't eve... I don't even know what we're talking about.<eos> I'm totally confused right now.<eos> Eric, relax.<eos> What did you find?<eos> You should probably read it.<eos> I will, I will;
You are high.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I can't lose you right now.<eos> This is very serious.<eos> I need you to go find some pliers or tweezers.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with my mom.<eos> Tell her that I don't want to sit next to Uncle Rod at Thanksgiving this year.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
You guys, I'm so sorry.<eos> - What was his name?<eos> - His name was Xander.<eos> Which is weird because who would choose the name "Xander"?<eos> You're right...<eos> Maybe his parents should have named him something that was a great idea, like "nuclear holocaust."<eos> Xander is dead.<eos> Why?<eos> That's not gonna help, Sonia.<eos> Nothing will.
An act, a gift, this grand...<eos> I'm unsure how we can express our gratitude for what you've done.<eos> Sara, Matthew, I appreciate you coming uptown to give thanks, but your trip was unnecessary.<eos> Nevertheless, we will find some way to repay you for this miracle that you've bestowed upon us, perhaps when I return.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> Tomorrow morn, I'm headed to Virginia to bring Sara's mother to New York.<eos> Excuse my candid speech, Dr. Freeman, but I thought you were an educated man.<eos> A negro trying to break into the south in the middle of this war is madness.<eos> And I take no offense, Mrs. Morehouse, but I vowed that I'd bring my wife's mother home and that is what I intend to do.<eos> No, you will not.
Well, it ain't exactly easy to watch the ballgame with you staring back at me.<eos> You think the shooters are going to text you before they open fire?<eos> I broke down and called my old man.<eos> I got nothing back.<eos> Mills, what's for lunch?<eos> Oh, um, I was bringing in some beef tips, but I don't think they're gonna taste that good raw, so we can do some pimento cheese sandwiches...<eos> How about Al's beef?<eos> Okay, all right. We'll do Al's beef.<eos> - Call it in.<eos> - I will.
Landlord... had him nobbled.<eos> He said he wanted a challenge.<eos> Death is quite a challenge.<eos> I wasn't the one who dumped him and left him with a broken heart.<eos> Oh, so it was my fault.<eos> You paid to have him nobbled, but it's my fault?<eos> He was a wreck.<eos> He forgot his bloody net.<eos> I thought he'd get over it.<eos> Maybe he will.
Come in, Rachel.<eos> Your request to be transferred off the Devereaux case has been denied.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> When you start a case around here, you finish it.<eos> And the traffic video?<eos> I've contacted the judge in that case.<eos> The conviction is under review.<eos> The matter will be resolved before Devereaux is sentenced in your case.<eos> Provided, of course, you get a conviction.<eos> I will.
And when was that?<eos> - Two days ago.<eos> - Miss Larkin, can you account for your whereabouts yesterday?<eos> Like, where I was?<eos> I was at my friend's salon.<eos> She's learning how to do waxing and needed someone to practice on.<eos> I got a free haircut, too.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just ask.<eos> Oh, we will.
Werner Forssmann inserted a urethral tube into his elbow, pushed it to his heart, then x-rayed himself to prove that cardiac catheterization is possible.<eos> There is a long and very healthy tradition of scientists making themselves the subject of their own studies.<eos> Well, I-I can't continue this work If it comes at the expense of your marriage.<eos> I am not discussing my sex life with you.<eos> According to Libby, there's little to discuss.<eos> I am very clear on where the line is between you and me and what we do here.<eos> - It is for the work.<eos> - I don't need you to tell me that.<eos> So then whatever goes on between us can't affect Libby.<eos> It won't.
Isn't the hotel on Sycamore?<eos> You mind if we get something to eat first?<eos> No. No.<eos> Who do you think he thinks I am?<eos> One of those golf pros at the club?<eos> Maybe the handyman?<eos> I've never had any secrets from him.<eos> But now I have you.<eos> And I want to keep you to myself and at the same time, tell everyone.<eos> But you won't, right?
Impossible.<eos> Simatech was only certified for the toxin this year.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> Yeah, you can go now.<eos> This fall, we are gonna drive through New England, see the leaves turn.<eos> I know this great inn that you would love.<eos> And you can teach me how to make your abgoosht.<eos> I am so sorry that... I was too busy last weekend.<eos> You are gonna get through this, Arastoo.<eos> You Will.
Why not?<eos> Hey, uh, Jim?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Care to make a wager?<eos> Wager on what?<eos> Me and my boys beat you at "brain burst," you lay off of Allie.<eos> You and these guys are gonna beat me at "brain burst"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do I get if you lose?<eos> We won't.
Really?<eos> You never wanted me to kill Katherine.<eos> Why are you protecting her, Stefan?<eos> Listen to yourself.<eos> Your rage is making you crazy.<eos> - Do you still have feelings for her?<eos> - This isn't even about Katherine.<eos> This is about Jeremy.<eos> What, you think that killing her will take all that pain away?<eos> It won't.
What happened on your wedding night?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> -Nothing?<eos> What do you mean, nothing?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - The marriage wasn't consummated?<eos> -Nothing happened. Nothing happened?<eos> Nothing at all? But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> - And it will.
Are you determined to put me off?<eos> OK!<eos> Well, if that's what you want.<eos> So shall we?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Why not what?<eos> Some of us are going on to the Embassy later.<eos> Oh, what fun.<eos> Oh, well, you can come, if you'd like.<eos> I will.
Well, when I decided to go to Rose's ball, I felt it was wrong not to tell you, since you'd asked.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> I suppose it came to me that these balls and presentations and comings out are not just aristocratic folderol but traditions by which members of this family measure their progress through life.<eos> And you wanted to be part of that?<eos> Well, I felt by dismissing it as trivia, I was being smug and intolerant.<eos> Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
I hope I can make you understand how important that is.<eos> I'll pay you whatever you want but it has to be a complete secret from my family.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I think it should be our secret, My Lady.<eos> Ours and no-one else's.<eos> I'll er... send a letter to myself tonight and tell Marjie it's about an old friend of mine who's died and asked for me to take the child.<eos> She won't question it.<eos> Then nobody but you and I will know.<eos> Mr Drewe, would you do that for me?<eos> For you and the little girl, My Lady, yes, I will.
If that's okay, I mean. Oh...<eos> Well, I mean, I saw you with two ladies.<eos> I thought you were with them.<eos> Never seen 'em before.<eos> So... cool to crash?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
I haven't seen him or heard from him in a while.<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm leaving you all this in a voice mail.<eos> I just feel like there's so much I wanna talk to you about.<eos> Hopefully I'll see you at the funeral in the morning.<eos> I'll save you a seat, 'kay?<eos> I love you.<eos> Yes?<eos> Pick me up in an hour.<eos> - What if he wakes up?<eos> - He won't.
You hooked him real good.<eos> Come here, you little bugger.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> Throw it back.<eos> It's a catfish, cuz.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
Hurry!<eos> I want to! So hurry and get out of there!<eos> The debris has crushed my legs... I wouldn't be able to run.<eos> You understand what that means.<eos> then!<eos> Why don't you ever listen to your mother?<eos> You can at least do this one last thing!<eos> Mikasa!<eos> No... No!<eos> all three of us will...
In prison, there's hundreds of 'em.<eos> All right.<eos> His name is Jimmy. He runs a service...<eos> Not another word, Mr. Blackwell.<eos> Agent Byrne, FBI.<eos> What the hell's going on here, Byrne?<eos> You work the count room in the Savoy, correct?<eos> I'm here to offer you a deal.<eos> If you agree to testify to how their count room skim operates, the state of Nevada is gonna drop all the charges against you.<eos> - Like hell it will.
- I don't...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> If a potential federal witness were to disappear, that would only bring more heat to the casino.<eos> But don't think there aren't consequences for your actions.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Fired...<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> Absolutely fired.<eos> But you need to know what will happen if you ever decide to talk.<eos> I won't.
Thanks, Daniel.<eos> And Nolan says thanks, too.<eos> Listen, I was thinking about coming to the studio later to see your interview. That is, if you think your father won't mind. No.<eos> No, not at all. I...<eos> I'd love to have you there.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> I love the Jedi mind trick on Danny boy.<eos> But it'll all be for bubkes if I can't break the Falcon.<eos> You will.
Is that who you're afraid of?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not afraid, I just...<eos> I don't know, I just feel... angry.<eos> Feeling powerless.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> We can't defend ourselves until we feel safe in our own skin.<eos> Do you... Feel safe in your own skin?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
Run the shutdown script.<eos> Get the rest of that C-4 down here.<eos> I want this door open, and then I want them all dead.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Unless you got a problem with that.<eos> Almost got it.<eos> What if Grace is right?<eos> What if we end the world?<eos> We won't, Aaron.
How do we know Dr. Kang isn't working for the Shop too?<eos> We don't.<eos> Part of me hopes he's dirty.<eos> At least I could punch someone.<eos> Alex, look.<eos> If this goes bad, I'm worried about what it'll do to Nikita.<eos> Make her understand that her family, the one that she's built, is there for her.<eos> She started this journey by herself.<eos> I need to know she will not end it alone.<eos> She won't.
Do you want the radio?<eos> No, I'm going to take a nap.<eos> Don't get caught.<eos> During lunch break.<eos> See you, then.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Explanation of social processes, communication, conflicts, decision-making, cooperation...<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I don't remember any of that.<eos> At your age, I probably won't either.
- Who's Annie Taylor? Oh, Higgins.<eos> Do you read the paper?<eos> She's the 63-year-old woman who just went over Niagara Falls in a barrel.<eos> Unfortunately, Detective Murdoch has asked me to remain at the station.<eos> What ever for?<eos> It's our first Victoria Day. You should have the day off.<eos> Well, the constabulary never rests, Dr. Grace.<eos> Particularly on official holidays.<eos> Uh, I'm free to escort you if you'd like.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, you won't.
You will test it tomorrow, on me.<eos> I must let you get back to your lab and ensure your calculations are correct.<eos> Tomorrow, van Helsing.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I thought I told you specifically to keep this to yourself!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
So, what do we do?<eos> Where's your phone?<eos> We're gonna call Gene.<eos> You're gonna tell him you're sorry.<eos> You're gonna tell him you know what he did.<eos> But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
No, I'm still waiting on the sign for the door to be ready.<eos> It was like a 6. What is this?<eos> Seriously, that's like a 4.<eos> Well, interview room 1 was empty, and you know kids... always managing to find a secluded space.<eos> And you're eavesdropping on them?<eos> Hey, this was not my idea.<eos> Unattended minors can get into trouble, and I think you'd be interested in the girl that your foster son is about to ask out on a date.<eos> Oh, he's not going to do that.<eos> I bet...<eos> One month of absolute civility that he will.
Now hand it over.<eos> Okay, let's try this again.<eos> You hand it over, I let her go.<eos> Don't trust him, Steve.<eos> What are you gonna do, hmm?<eos> You gonna watch her die, son?<eos> I think you're out of moves.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> You didn't want anybody to see what was on there anyway, right?<eos> Now nobody ever will.
It's my fault.<eos> You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I-I drove her away.<eos> Oh, Raj.<eos> Penny, I...<eos> I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
Now, the questionnaire is essential to our research.<eos> So just think of it as eating your greens first.<eos> Well, I think we can skip straight to dessert tonight.<eos> In fact, take the questionnaires home.<eos> You can mail them back to us.<eos> I'm sure Mrs. Johnson can provide a stamped envelope.<eos> Tell her to remove the pins from her hair.<eos> They'll interfere with the leads from the electroencephalogram.<eos> Which, actually, we won't be using tonight.<eos> Actually, we will.
Though I-I'm no great fan of montage.<eos> I don't suppose you've read André Bazin,<eos> "The Ontology Of The Photographic Image"?<eos> I'm waiting for the movie.<eos> It's pretty theoretical.<eos> Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.
You are under oath.<eos> I agreed to a solution benefiting both parties.<eos> I'm so glad you said that.<eos> Whew! Uh, your honor, with your permission, we'd like to contest Dr. Hall's statement with a demonstration.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - A pitching machine, Your Honor.<eos> I also have an affidavit from the maker stating it's been properly calibrated for its consistency.<eos> If you turn this courtroom into a batting cage, Mr. Bash, I'll run you.<eos> Your Honor, a little leeway.<eos> We won't.
He's an imaginary monster that lives in the basement.<eos> It's a ghost story they all tell each other.<eos> Creak isn't just a story!<eos> Tell me more about this Creak.<eos> You have been making accusations about my hospital...<eos> Abuse...<eos> The blue medicine.<eos> It's time for you to forget.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.<eos> I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable, but the guy's a junkie, sir.<eos> How far is he into withdrawal?<eos> Hardly started.<eos> What he's feeling now, it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.<eos> Methadone would make it easier.<eos> Has to be cold turkey.<eos> Where he's going, we need him functional.<eos> Even if it kills him?<eos> It won't.
You know, making sure I'm doing the right thing.<eos> Do you have concerns? No!<eos> No, I don't have concerns.<eos> I have concerns.<eos> Carter, I wish someone had done this for me on the day of my first, second and fourth weddings.<eos> Not the third.<eos> She was a shot of life.<eos> And for what it's worth, I was noticing, there's actually plenty of room in here.<eos> Oh, my God! Kick them out already! I will.<eos> I-I will.
Get in there and get your dad.<eos> Looks like I don't have a choice.<eos> I told Michael to land, find alternate transport to Mumbai.<eos> We'll head back to D.C.<eos> This is gonna work.<eos> We're gonna save him, I promise.<eos> The DNA was a perfect match.<eos> You handled yourself well.<eos> What happens when I refuse to cooperate?<eos> You won't.
Keep looking.<eos> I'm telling you, they've got something big planned for him.<eos> They'll never see him coming.<eos> It will be trickier without Peller, but we'll make it work.<eos> It had to be done.<eos> You wasted a valuable asset.<eos> We can't see this through as designed without Peller in place.<eos> We have the Stuxworm.<eos> We can improvise.<eos> Oh, I will.
Easy.<eos> Careful.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - We're safe.<eos> A bubble has now been created for Nikita to believe in.<eos> She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.
I have no idea who that is.<eos> You deny being Dr. Sabet?<eos> Categorically.<eos> Don't worry, pet.<eos> You're perfectly safe.<eos> You'll be with me? The entire time.<eos> Dr. Bates, will you please read these words?<eos> Now, Betty, close your eyes.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will not.
They'll listen to you.<eos> That day in court, you said if I worked hard and turned my life around, doors would open for me.<eos> I remember that, and I stand by it.<eos> Okay, so I did what you said, 'cept the doors are still closed.<eos> All I'm asking is for you to open one for me.<eos> I'll see what I can do...<eos> But ultimately, it's up to you.<eos> I can't make people trust you, Lenny.<eos> You have to earn that.<eos> I will.
Byrne worked part-time in a builder's supply yard so on and so on.<eos> Gives us nothing.<eos> I can talk to the parents, see if the blanket rings any bells.<eos> Think about it.<eos> They've got the big car, the big house.<eos> They won't even notice.<eos> All I need is his pin. Or hers.<eos> They'll think it's online fraud or hackers.<eos> But what if they found out?<eos> They won't.
- She said she did it?<eos> Then you were right to send her away.<eos> I don't know if I could have.<eos> You could have, Maggie.<eos> You've done harder things.<eos> Don't doubt yourself.<eos> We don't get to anymore.<eos> Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.<eos> - We need to do something.<eos> - We will.
I'm going into town.<eos> Avi's in charge.<eos> He needs a doctor, Raymond.<eos> If he dies, it's a mortal sin and we all go to Hell.<eos> You still believe that crap?<eos> After what he did to our family?<eos> I know killing's wrong, that's all.<eos> We take him to a hospital, he turns Bunch in for shooting him.<eos> Maybe he won't.<eos> Oh, he will.
No, no, no, they see me, they see me!<eos> Just memories.<eos> You won't be hurt by your memories.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> Good.<eos> Now tell us what you see.<eos> Tell us everything.<eos> But I can't control it.<eos> Neither of us will.
I can't think of a better way to spend an evening... or more delightful company.<eos> I am Dr. Brick Breeland, Lemon's father.<eos> Pleased to meet you, sir.<eos> Carter Covington.<eos> Carter. Well, Daddy, don't let us keep you.<eos> Oh, nonsense, sweetheart.<eos> Carter, let me tell you a little story about a friend of mine who got so busy at work, he took his eye off his lovely daughter.<eos> And she ended up dating a bartender!<eos> I bet he never let that happen again.<eos> No, he won't.
What wouldn't have happened?<eos> I got fucking drunk and I shot him.<eos> You what?<eos> Ray had to take care of it.<eos> He killed him right in front of us.<eos> It really fucked up Terry and it really fucked up me.<eos> How does Ray feel about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you fucking ask him?<eos> All right, I will.
I'm just telling you the truth.<eos> I hope so. Sir, you know I didn't do this.<eos> I didn't send that cash and note.<eos> Someone else has to be involved. And that's why you waited this long to tell me about the necklace?<eos> Because you think that cash and note lets you off the hook?<eos> No, but I think it helps.<eos> Maybe you just don't want to move to Arizona.<eos> You were gonna let your mom take the fall, weren't you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> She most likely will anyway.
'Darling! Darling, just relax.'<eos> OK? Relax and open the door.<eos> 'There's no-one here, I promise!<eos> I saw them!<eos> 'They're gone now.<eos> Please...'<eos> You can trust me. I'm a doctor.<eos> No!<eos> You'll let them in!<eos> 'We won't.'
He uses normal, hard-working people as cannon fodder to help him get what he wants.<eos> You don't have to tell me, kid.<eos> There's loads of them out there, scratching each other's backs, greasing the wheels, looking the other way, playing the system.<eos> It's the old boy's network - look after their own.<eos> Yeah, well...we look after our own, too, right?<eos> Yes, we do. Jack, I read every police report on everyone who died in that fire.<eos> There was a kid, he had trials for West Ham the next day.<eos> His whole life, just starting to take shape.<eos> Granger needs to know what he's done. He needs to pay for it.<eos> He will.
"I'm sorry, Bay, you can't spend time with your biological mother"?<eos> You can't go live with a fresh out of rehab alcoholic basket case.<eos> And she would have done it anyway.<eos> And given you the cold shoulder for like a year.<eos> Besides, Regina is not a basket case.<eos> Honey, it's only fair.<eos> We had Daphne for weeks.<eos> She's still here and Regina's back.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in with Regina for good?<eos> She won't.
- No, we can't.<eos> - She obviously needs help.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> Just put her over the line and that's it?<eos> - Yep. - Yeah.<eos> You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
How'd she find out?<eos> The little girl got sick with meningitis.<eos> - She okay?<eos> - She's healthy, but as a result of the infection, she went deaf.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What do we do?<eos> - We fix it.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we will.
Okay, Briana.<eos> Remember how we have to talk in here.<eos> Jerry Stone, my boss, and the C.E.O. of Stone Quarry Enterprises, introduced me to Mark Hull.<eos> I had sex with Mr. Hull.<eos> He paid Jerry for that, and he tipped me $80.<eos> Did Jerry video me having sex with that guy like he did the others?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you gonna watch that video?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Abaddon?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Thought you Kentucky fried that meatsuit.<eos> I did, Dean.<eos> You -- well, then, how did she get it back?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And why's she playing G.I. Joe?<eos> No clue.<eos> Why don't you ask her when we find her?<eos> Oh, I will.
- Fly! - Caw!<eos> - He could fly.<eos> - I'm flying!<eos> I'm doing it, Book Cop.<eos> I'm winning the war!<eos> Fire!<eos> Fife-Eagle Cop,<eos> You're dying.<eos> All I ever wanted was to have a place in history.<eos> You will.
You lied to me.<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> Hello to you, too.<eos> Cami, Rebekah, Rebekah, Cami.<eos> I see you still have a thing for blonds.<eos> Hey!<eos> Tell me where Elijah is.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Tell me where he is, or I will kill you!<eos> No, you won't.
And I stabbed him.<eos> I couldn't let him take me away -- not -- not with Bonnie in her condition.<eos> It was either him or your wife.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lee, baby.<eos> I am not getting better.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> No.<eos> No. I never will.
Vikram is dead.<eos> I know.<eos> There must be someone covering for him.<eos> Someone who you think murdered Regina Crane?<eos> I'm just trying to solve this case.<eos> Well, you're not doing a very good job.<eos> The prime suspect is out there poisoning other students.<eos> What are you gonna do about him?<eos> John, can you just look into what might've happened with those files, please?<eos> Okay, I'll...
- Lacey, now he's sending it out to people!<eos> I even heard a few Chess Club guys talking about it.<eos> I don't really feel like confronting that creep Doug.<eos> Lacey, he...<eos> If it makes it to my friends, then so be it.<eos> They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.
Lacey, he...<eos> If it makes it to my friends, then so be it.<eos> They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.<eos> I mean, it'll be weird,<eos> - but she'll understand.<eos> - No no, she won't!
I have mine.<eos> My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.<eos> It's a delay. Not a failure.<eos> I'm not sure there's a distinction. Not in this context.<eos> What Duncan is trying to say is, we can still right the ship.<eos> Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
You run toward them...<eos> and fix them.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's what you do for the people you love.<eos> Why do you keep dealing those?<eos> It's not going to change.<eos> There's got to be a way.<eos> The girls have never lived this long before.<eos> I don't think I can take losing them again.<eos> We won't.
Someone in the White House must have gotten to her.<eos> She's gonna go on live tv and tell the world she had the affair.<eos> Nothing starts until I give the okay.<eos> Was it you? Did your people do this?<eos> Jake Ballard is alive.<eos> - They'll release him?<eos> - No. I tried.<eos> There are protocols in place.<eos> No, they need to release him.<eos> They won't.
I've seen him praying before his window on his knees facing Jerusalem morning, noon, and night, always the same.<eos> Then perhaps we need to make him stop.<eos> He won't do it.<eos> Then perhaps we need to make sure he continues.<eos> You say there is nothing anyone can do to stop his prayers.<eos> No, nothing.<eos> What if the penalty for this devotion of his was death?<eos> If we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execution?<eos> Don't be ridiculous. He'll just stop praying.<eos> No, he won't.
Knockoff suit has already seen my face.<eos> - Hagen doesn't need to.<eos> - Thanks, Moz.<eos> You caused quite a ruckus.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> This is the real thing?<eos> You know your forgeries.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
When you're gone, do you think she's suddenly gonna stop menacing this land?<eos> And who will protect the people then?<eos> Did I protect them today?<eos> I couldn't even help that poor girl.<eos> And don't kid yourself.<eos> She isn't gonna stop with the peasants.<eos> She's going to come after the people who are closest to me.<eos> I will stand by your side no matter what.<eos> Even if it means our death.<eos> Which it probably will.
He had no idea he hated you that much.<eos> Maybe he just needed somewhere to focus his pain.<eos> Mike lost someone he loves.<eos> But enough people have suffered.<eos> We have to work together to build a new Haven.<eos> It's time to let go of old grudges.<eos> He's made mistakes, but he's our only chance.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
Maggie!<eos> Happy first day!<eos> Oh. Yeah, I guess.<eos> Hey. So... how are things going with the college applications?<eos> Oh, they're fine. It's fine.<eos> Hey, what schools are you applying to?<eos> Don't even try it, Walt.<eos> It's not gonna happen!<eos> God, I hope she doesn't out me.<eos> She won't.
There's only one solution.<eos> We need Duke.<eos> - What for?<eos> - You know.<eos> Duke has to kill me.<eos> No, you can't start thinking like that.<eos> We already have four dead.<eos> If that hospital goes, we're talking a lot more than that.<eos> But what if Duke killing you. Doesn't cure Aiden's Trouble?<eos> Of course it will.
Crap.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Open the register.<eos> No! Please!<eos> I won't talk. I won't talk.<eos> No, you won't.
None of this is funny.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> And I'm horrible for feeling this way, but I don't care.<eos> Jennifer, stop.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> After this, you and me... we will still be okay.<eos> No, I was with you when your brother died, after your brother died, everything that you went through.<eos> Look... - no.<eos> No... we were supposed to have our flavored-coffee commercial tomorrow with all of this stuff behind us... William, that stupid door.<eos> We still will.
You can feel her, can't you?<eos> You can feel... Us.<eos> We better keep going.<eos> They're not going to find us.<eos> You ready to take that chance?<eos> You know what they'll do.<eos> We've broken every rule there is.<eos> Yeah, but we've had so much fun doing it.<eos> Mara, they'll take you from me.<eos> No, they won't.
You know, I've always considered you my brother... always, since the day I was adopted.<eos> You are my brother.<eos> I am closer to you than anyone else.<eos> I saw agent Howard's photo in Jennifer's file, and I didn't want anyone to find his photo in my file.<eos> But why do you think you're from there?<eos> I've been there.<eos> You're coming to the lighthouse.<eos> No.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't!
Pack it in!<eos> Stop it, that is an order!<eos> I was just about to do that.<eos> I will not have this kind of behaviour in my incident room.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> Tidy up.<eos> Don't let it happen again.<eos> It won't.
We only get one shot at this.<eos> You ready?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making certain I don't slow you down.<eos> You know what you must do.<eos> Good luck, Cyrus.<eos> I won't leave you!<eos> There's no time to argue.<eos> When Jafar learns you witnessed my escape without alerting the guards, he will kill you.<eos> No. He won't.
Crap.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Aren't you excited about the interview?<eos> Well, I was, except it's right in the middle of the concert.<eos> I'll just have to...<eos> Be direct and explain to Walt that this interview's really important.<eos> No.<eos> What I have to do is figure out how to be in two places at once.<eos> You're never gonna pull this off.<eos> Sure I will.
Look, guys, look, I am big enough to overlook that and still offer to help you guys out.<eos> Help us out?<eos> This is a high-profile case, and I am willing to let you guys exclusively benefit from my out-of-the-box crime-solving mind.<eos> And what do you get?<eos> Escape from the life at the loft.<eos> Ah.<eos> Sorry, Castle.<eos> If Gates were to find out...<eos> Yeah.<eos> She won't!
She's ex-french intelligence.<eos> She now makes a handsome living Selling secrets, mostly of a technological nature.<eos> I really don't understand any of it,<eos> But she's clearly stepping up on this one, Trying to make a legacy for herself.<eos> She owns that nightclub.<eos> Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun Until she tried to strangle me with her stocking. I'll get a warrant.<eos> You'll have it by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk, and even if she did, What would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know seth's location.<eos> She won't.
No, I get it.<eos> All right.<eos> Fellas.<eos> Shit.<eos> Our new tail.<eos> This is bad, Jackie.<eos> We got a very, very busy week ahead of us.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to finish that conversation.<eos> We will.
- Are you gonna tell Carrie?<eos> - I haven't made up my mind yet.<eos> Having sex for the first time is a big deal.<eos> Hopefully, it can... it can be special with me.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Really sure.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Nobody saw you, right?<eos> - 'Cause if your dad found out...<eos> - He won't.
I'll call TM, get the vote.<eos> Jax, Gaalan, Gaalan's a lunatic, but he's smart, man.<eos> No matter what the plan is, they're not gonna put themselves at risk.<eos> I know.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Irish will die before they get caught.<eos> Aye. And if this shit goes sideways, they're gonna blast a very bloody way out.<eos> We're so damn close.<eos> I don't want our last push out of guns to end in a pile of dead cops.<eos> It won't, brother.
How you gonna do that?<eos> Once a week I head out to pick up cottonwood, yarrow bark, some other meds, and I store it in here.<eos> Cozy.<eos> So what makes you think they're just gonna let you out of here?<eos> Porter: The town still needs medicine.<eos> Troops do too.<eos> I can sneak Aaron past, right out to Monroe.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> What if they search the wagon?<eos> - They won't.
Except for you two.<eos> You two are complete strangers.<eos> - Hmm. - You know, I think I'm gonna change where I was gonna have you sit.<eos> Mike, can you help me for a second?<eos> - What's he doing here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I hate to say it, but I'm not even looking forward to Thanksgiving this year.<eos> My family just fights all the time.<eos> You should come to my house for Thanksgiving.<eos> Okay, I will.
There'll be a meeting in the staffroom...<eos> - Oh. Excuse me, have you seen Mr. Bates?<eos> - Yeah, he should be back in a minute.<eos> - Hey, how are you?<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Did you and your... dad find a house?<eos> Oh! Um, not yet.<eos> Sorry about the other day, rushing off like that.<eos> If you want some help, let me know, because we've just listed a couple of fantastic properties.<eos> I will!
Well, I just said I would think about it.<eos> I'm still glad.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you care so much?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Brandy? What?<eos> I-I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> Yeah. It won't.
- Uncle Nucky, I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I just... Couldn't be there anymore.<eos> If you're trying to impress me, you're off to a very poor start.<eos> This isn't a game, Will.<eos> I need to trust you. I need men around me who can keep their wits.<eos> I know.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
You understand?<eos> I understand.<eos> Good.<eos> I tried to get them out, but I couldn't.<eos> Cynthia thinks... the whole town thinks... that the lantern started that fire.<eos> And I thought so too until now.<eos> Now I know it was me.<eos> Whatever this is, clearly I can't control it.<eos> What if I do something like that to Cynthia?<eos> You won't.
No, that is out of the question.<eos> From now on, we handle everything internally.<eos> The last thing you want is to have the Council show up on your doorstep and question your competence.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> She saved me... that black girl.<eos> That monster, it was Bastien. And the voodoo queen sent him here for me.<eos> What do you think, I don't know that?<eos> Just keep that information to yourself, you understand?<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
People can change.<eos> Terrible... unspeakable things happen to all of us, but... that doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's life.<eos> Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for 14 years, you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about.<eos> The one person in his screwed-up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter.<eos> You took his desire to protect and save you, and you perverted it.<eos> You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
It isn't easy making friends in grade school when you sound like Natasha.<eos> I... Don't have a lot of time.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Must hurry.<eos> Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> You weren't going to leave without me, were you?<eos> I should kill you right now!<eos> You won't.
Ah, so listen.<eos> Doing the thing was 50,000.<eos> Keeping quiet about it, I'm thinking it should be 50 more.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, I want word to spread.<eos> It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
She told you about me? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> Look, when I was pregnant with Morgan, the hormones made me crazy, just moody and weepy and...<eos> It's normal.<eos> Just give her some time.<eos> She'll call you, she will, she just needs a bit of space right now.<eos> Okay, okay, Mrs. Sanders. - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Tell Morgan... - I will.<eos> I will.
He's always home.<eos> Seemed like a natural.<eos> Okay, I got to go.<eos> I can't sit here anymore.<eos> Lacey, if Bob's making you uncomfortable...<eos> No, I just got waxed and my shorts are sticking.<eos> I did that.<eos> So you're the Devil, huh?<eos> Tell your buddy Barack he's doing a hell of a job.<eos> I will.
I don't care.<eos> Why?<eos> All I ever do is lie and I screw up.<eos> That is all-- that is all I ever do.<eos> No.<eos> There was no job in Mexico.<eos> There was nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> I don't want to leave you.<eos> I won't.
What else would I do, exactly?<eos> - After my debt was paid?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You think I still mean you harm?<eos> - Why would that be?<eos> - All I meant was...<eos> You don't pick your family or their faith.<eos> And it doesn't matter whose blood flows through your veins.<eos> You choose your own path.<eos> Or your King will.
This is not glamorous.<eos> This is not what you think it is.<eos> You are one of 10,000 beautiful boys here in New York City, and the word that you will hear more than any other during your brief career... will be... "no."<eos> Well, you know, like, dreams aren't easy, and, I mean, I come from a place where even the idea of sitting in this room with you would seem impossible.<eos> I mean, I know who I am, and... I know where I'm headed in life.<eos> I can take a few no's along the way.<eos> I do like you, Trouty Mouth.<eos> (giggles) Well, this is awesome. Okay, this is so awesome.<eos> I'll get those, - uh, pictures taken right away.<eos> - Uh, no, no, no, you won't.
No!<eos> Mike!<eos> Where's Coulson?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Coulson.<eos> We land in half an hour.<eos> Good.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work.<eos> I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
"We polked you in '44.<eos> We shall Pierce you in '52."<eos> Meet the 14th President of our great Republic.<eos> Always the Professor.<eos> That was not meant to be a lesson. It was a warning.<eos> Olivia Pope knows about Remington, and now she's working for Josephine Marcus.<eos> If she thought she needed it, she'd use it against us.<eos> She'd let Marcus use it against us.<eos> She thinks she knows. She thinks she knows because of Ballard, and he's yet to come across anything concrete.<eos> And he won't.
I am.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You're thinking I'm making a huge mistake.<eos> What if you are?<eos> This isn't something you can just go back and undo.<eos> Why don't you wait a year, okay?<eos> Move into the dorms.<eos> I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.<eos> And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won't say a word.<eos> Yes, you will.
They'll want a ghost... so we must give them one.<eos> - Christian, can it be done?<eos> - Yes, it's possible.<eos> Their journey will end at the same place as the final instalment, in Grace's bedroom.<eos> Then they must wait until they arrive here, and then they're given the chance to purchase the final edition.<eos> Once they've walked through the entire store.<eos> And Christian will be here to capture a memento of their experience.<eos> Thank you, Denise.<eos> We haven't done it yet.<eos> But we will.
He won't show up until the morning.<eos> If he does, he will come back drunk and beat us both up.<eos> Should I stay here tonight?<eos> But that would also be a problem, right?<eos> Let me take Ihsan, then.<eos> Let him stay with me for a few days.<eos> Of course, if Ismail doesn't mind it.<eos> He won't.<eos> You can tell him that we went to the social services center.<eos> I will.
Kill the President.<eos> Correct.<eos> So if she does this, she injects the President with the poison... he'll die instantly?<eos> Within seconds.<eos> You're positive?<eos> I need to know, if I ask her to do this, it's going to work.<eos> That he'll die right away and will it be traceable?<eos> Will it look like he's dying of natural causes?<eos> I need to know that, uh, she won't get caught.<eos> She won't.
You near as said it yourself.<eos> The jar contained the Song of the Sirens.<eos> I've been foolish, very foolish.<eos> I must seek out Circe again.<eos> I cannot sit here and watch Medusa die.<eos> You would trust this Circe after all she has done?<eos> You would be lucky to return with your life.<eos> Then we have to find another way.<eos> Do not worry my love, for you are everything to me... ..and I will not lose you.<eos> I will not.
Yes.<eos> The moon is my sun.<eos> I like to kill beetles.<eos> Beetles are teachers.<eos> I sleep with a fork.<eos> All right, guys, time to find a new family dog.<eos> Hey, Chris, you're kind of a creep.<eos> You should get a ferret.<eos> You're right, I am.<eos> And I will!
And I'm here to help you.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Blood cell count of 642.<eos> Acute lymphocytic leukemia.<eos> Unsuccessful third round of chemotherapy.<eos> Your wife is a very sick woman.<eos> I warned you to stay away from my family.<eos> I took the safety valve off.<eos> I can dump 20 cc of morphine into her before you take another step.<eos> You won't.
Okay. Happy to do it.<eos> Surprised, but happy.<eos> Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute chef jackets.<eos> Oh, chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs to wear these.<eos> But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.<eos> I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
I'm a swan.<eos> And a surgeon... a freaking kick ass surgeon... who, by the way, has had sex before.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Does daddy know?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
When your boss dies, you can then be boss.<eos> You then proudly marry her.<eos> Mr. Mrs. Thief.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Tao Shing-bong.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Sure.<eos> You want me to make shrimp dumplings Or pork dumplings?<eos> Then you'd better work harder.<eos> I Will.
Uh, two fingers.<eos> Three at the most.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Dignity and ethics.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, I'll dial it back a notch for the lunch.<eos> Good. So no crazy character voices, no fruity orders...<eos> So Dandy Randy and his Banana Band won't be ordering the beet salad with the culinary foam?<eos> They will not.
Oh!<eos> Excuse me, I'm just gonna have to "Oh" this out until I'm not surprised anymore.<eos> Lois, before I get mad at your dad, h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?<eos> No, Peter, we've been through this.<eos> Good.<eos> I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
If I step out of this house, I'm not the one who's going to die.<eos> Mr. Do Min Joon is going to die, too.<eos> Why? Because news articles saying that you're my secret lover will be out.<eos> Everyone will know your face. Do you want to live a noisy life?<eos> While every little movement of yours being watched by people... That's more terrible than you think.<eos> Please let me stay for a while.<eos> I beg you.<eos> First, don't touch anything in this house.<eos> I won't touch anything.<eos> I won't.
I would love to stay, thank you.<eos> He works for the company too, and we never knew.<eos> Oh, my. - I thought, "Bring him to dominoes night."<eos> - Well, that's perfect.<eos> Thursday evenings here are always so exciting.<eos> I mean, the banter, especially Inspector Michaud.<eos> And his son Olivier.<eos> He's fantastic.<eos> Come, come. You must meet everyone.<eos> Oh, I will.
I hated you.<eos> You hated me?<eos> Before you ever touched me.<eos> I used to walk into a room and I'd see you there. And you'd barely look up.<eos> I'd find myself moving around and around your chair hoping that a small part of my dress or my hand might touch you.<eos> Do you still hate me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you can leave me.<eos> But I won't.
Fuck no, they don't wanna see my research. I don't have enough cash in my pocket, to make it worth their while.<eos> It's enough! - That's it right there.<eos> I'm gonna be a pain in your ass, till I'm six feet under.<eos> - Let's go outside, now.<eos> Maybe, one day. You'll get off your ass and do your fuckin' job!<eos> I need you to leave, let's go.<eos> Here, pass this around.<eos> Here, Don't listen to those cocksuckers.<eos> We think it is in everyone's best interest that you resign.<eos> I won't.
Or perhaps you are trying to sketch Maman?<eos> Isabelle.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have seen you when you think we are all asleep.<eos> Do you not want me?<eos> Do you not want to do those things to me?<eos> She is not even my mother.<eos> She need only say a word.<eos> She won't.
That's bullshit, that's just words. it's nothing.<eos> If that were true, you would have cut back on the touring.<eos> - You would have paid more attention to what was going on with me.<eos> Not always looking for a perfect goddamn fingering to a Haydn quartet.<eos> I did the best I could.<eos> I tried to be a good mother to you.<eos> I wanted to be perfect, but this is a musician's life.<eos> We rehearse and we practice and we perform.<eos> Unfortunately, that's how it's going to be for you, too, you'll see.<eos> No, I won't.
You got a name for it?<eos> And with a United States military man, no less.<eos> You are a disgrace to that uniform!<eos> No, he's not a Marine.<eos> He buys those uniforms on eBay so Dad doesn't find out he's a modern jazz dancer. What?<eos> That's possibly worse than the incest thing.<eos> This is an abomination.<eos> I'm telling Todd.<eos> - No, he won't believe you.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
- It'll be fine.<eos> I can't.<eos> No ...<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't.<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> They just want to see you.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> They will kill me.<eos> - No, they won't.
- I just did.<eos> I'm playing by the rules.<eos> Where you live, the rules are different.<eos> All right?<eos> He set me up, had my friend killed, took his chances and paid the price.<eos> By the way, I know guys that would've done him real slow.<eos> - When this is over...<eos> - You wanna do this dance?<eos> - I won't have a have a choice, will I?<eos> - No, you won't.
- Why isn't she here?<eos> - Because!<eos> She's a lady.<eos> And ladies, unlike your little sister, stay at home while the men go out...<eos> Kick the shit out of him!<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> He'll talk.<eos> - Just tape him up. We've done enough.<eos> I know that it's not easy to watch, but it will work.<eos> - No, it won't.
What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?<eos> It's Reaping Day. The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.<eos> I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.<eos> Of course you were.<eos> Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers. No.<eos> Not today.<eos> It was the first deer I've seen in a year.<eos> Now I have nothing. Okay.<eos> What if they did? Just one year. What if everyone just stopped watching?<eos> - They won't, Gale.
Use your side mirror.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Why couldn't you do that in the test?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I didn't really want a license.<eos> Listen...<eos> Of course I know where you're coming from.<eos> But you gotta trust me to figure this out.<eos> - Don't do this again, please.<eos> - I won't.
Do you have anything to say to me? Anything?<eos> Negative, sir.<eos> Enjoy these naval exercises, Hopper. They are likely to be your last.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Is there anything I can do to help?<eos> Negative.<eos> If you want to talk about anything..<eos> I don't.<eos> If you change your mind..<eos> I won't.
Do you like Lady Gaga?<eos> Nah, Lady Gaga's pop.<eos> I like hip-hop, period.<eos> 'Hip-hop, period'?<eos> - Is that the same as rap?<eos> No, it's different, slightly.<eos> - Would you mind telling me what rap is?<eos> - Tell me what opera is.<eos> No, yes, uh, well, yes, I will...<eos> I will eventually.
She does so want to perform the quartet.<eos> Jean.<eos> Take part.<eos> If you can't sing at the gala, do conjuring tricks.<eos> The only alternative is to be guest of honour at the crematorium.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - There's some change, Ms Horton.<eos> No, you keep that.<eos> Could you give this to Mr Paget?<eos> - Of course I will.
Yeah, who are you?<eos> Eric Nolan.<eos> I'm a friend of Sara's.<eos> You're Eric?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - I haven't seen her in weeks.<eos> Tell her to call me or something if you see her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Picking up my pathetic check.<eos> I got my bike back.<eos> That's good.<eos> Good.<eos> I was thinking, if you wanted to meet me off campus, you could.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Come on, Ellis.<eos> Why don't you spend some of that allowance money your parents send you for being the perfect boy?<eos> - If you change your mind...<eos> - I won't.
And I get an apartment in the city.<eos> It's happening again all over again, right?<eos> I have made many mistakes.<eos> - Dad, this is not about you.<eos> Or about something you've done.<eos> This is about me.<eos> Who I wanna be.<eos> Who I am.<eos> Tell me what to say so I will not lose again.<eos> It will not.
Can you put the brakes on it?<eos> It's five against two, and they're packing more heat than we are.<eos> But, you know, sure, what the hell?<eos> We can try.<eos> No, Sam. Sit tight.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> So, they're gonna do what?<eos> Just sit there and let Sharif sail away with even more money?<eos> They make a move, they're dead. Then we have to make a move.<eos> We will, but not right now.
You have two bricks?<eos> Yes!<eos> Throw them down immediately!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> There's a little goat eating the wire!<eos> You need to lose weight immediately!<eos> My pockets are empty.<eos> I could poo.<eos> That won't be enough to make a difference.<eos> Yes, it will.
I just get so messed up inside. Like I'm not there or something.<eos> - Tell it to someone who cares.<eos> - Look, I know. I'm sorry. Just we've all become such good friends.<eos> Good friends?<eos> Do you mean the people that I've known since kindergarten... and you've known for six months?<eos> Those good friends?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna do anything to ruin our relationship.<eos> It's ruined. Okay? So stop calling everyone.<eos> Stop embarrassing yourself.<eos> Okay, I will.
Puppy love.<eos> What am I supposed to do with a puppy?<eos> (WHINES) We're going to have so much fun!<eos> You could take me on walks!<eos> You could throw sticks.<eos> I will retrieve them!<eos> You can rub my tummy!<eos> All off-topic.<eos> What I need you to do is many me.<eos> Yes, I will.
Can I live With that?<eos> Well, I don't know, Bella.<eos> I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life turn into a very large dog.<eos> My daughter looks like my daughter. But doesn't.<eos> Can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that you need to know?<eos> And I don't need to know this?<eos> No. Really, you don't.<eos> Not gonna lose you again.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then you won't.
No, but I'm getting... I'm getting to it.<eos> - Yeah, well, you should get to it. I'm just saying.<eos> You could use some of that.<eos> You could use some Shut the hell up. How about that?<eos> - You just lack initiative. It's not that big... - Oh, yeah?<eos> You lack a dick.<eos> Boys, please tell us what's going on here.<eos> Uh, well, it would seem that a Virgin Mary has appeared... in the syrup of a local man's pancake.<eos> No, it has not.<eos> Uh, well, it will in a second, okay?
Since then, we use condoms.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Pierre always said I was an accident.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We decided to keep you.<eos> We really wanted you.<eos> Honest?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> So tell Pierre to stop bugging me.<eos> L certainly will.
It doesn't hurt?<eos> It won't hurt me?<eos> Oh God, my dear!<eos> Who did it?<eos> What happened?<eos> 50 hours in surgical room.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Even for you.<eos> Do you think he will forgive me?<eos> He will.
But the good news is, you know... he'll love you forever.<eos> That's in our DNA.<eos> We stick around.<eos> He worries about you, you know.<eos> It puts a lot of pressure on him.<eos> I know.<eos> I just - I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.<eos> Why don't you talk to Claire?<eos> Oh, if I open up to her, she'll leave me.<eos> – No, she won't.
And because of your foolishness first that idiot Ronnie and then that old Victor...<eos> Next time you take my papa's name, do it with respect.<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> You should be thankful that it was my left hand.<eos> Open the door, baby.<eos> Oh. Charlie has got a gun now.<eos> What will he do?<eos> Shoot me.<eos> Come on, shoot me.<eos> You will surely, but not so easily.
Get me help first, and I'll tell you.<eos> If you tell me where she is, I won't shoot you again.<eos> But you have five seconds.<eos> You stupid bitch, she's alive.<eos> She's under your house.<eos> She's been there the whole time.<eos> My God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you the truth. You said you wouldn't shoot me.<eos> I won't.
(Kate) Let's try up in here.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's space here.<eos> [Ruth groans] She needs to lie down.<eos> (Kate) Let's set up a bed in there.<eos> Kate.<eos> There's some kind of control room through there.<eos> We can use it as a base.<eos> We need to find David.<eos> And we will.
He smells so good.<eos> - No.<eos> It starts at midnight?<eos> - So?<eos> - We can be there for 10 minutes.<eos> - It's Halloween.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - He will not.
- What happened to your arm?<eos> - I fell, and it hurts a lot.<eos> - Should we get the party started?<eos> - Mom will be so happy to see you.<eos> There's just a little thing you need know about Dad. What now?<eos> - I really should kick his ass.<eos> - Don't do that here.<eos> - It's your sister's party.<eos> - But when my arm is cured, I'll give him a...<eos> No, you won't!
I was your defender and your apologist, but no more!<eos> Charlie, I can do this.<eos> You're about to be questioned by a Federal agency about piloting an airliner drunk, an airliner that crashed, and you continue to drink!<eos> And stumble around. What kind of crazy ya have to be to do that?<eos> I'm afraid of you.<eos> – Ok alright, let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you, they're staking out all my houses anyway,<eos> I'll stay with you, until... until... you know un- un- until the hearing.<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
Well, after last week's family meltdown, this laptop is the only thing keeping me sane.<eos> Writing is my new outlet. You should be happy for me.<eos> If you say so.<eos> But Vanya say same thing about "Warcraft," and then D.S.L. bill come...<eos> Yes, of course everything's set for tonight.<eos> There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.<eos> I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> Jack, they won't.
You kill him the same way he killed Nathan.<eos> Deal was ten grand.<eos> You'll get it.<eos> Here, same time tomorrow.<eos> You have to go to the police.<eos> Mitch, you heard him.<eos> That man is unstable.<eos> What if he does it?<eos> What if people find out we knew?<eos> They won't.
She's innocent, I'm certain of it.<eos> How?<eos> How can you be so sure or something you don't know?<eos> In the Church of Man, you believe what you see;<eos> In the Church of God, we live by faith, not by sight.<eos> She needs more than faith on her side.<eos> She needs you.<eos> Will you hang tight a minute, Kyle?<eos> I can't miss my bus.<eos> You won't.
He's out of surgery.<eos> Doesn't look like it hit anything critical.<eos> It's time to stop screwing around now.<eos> Where the hell is Mitch?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> If you don't want me to call you a liar, you're gonna have to stop lying to me.<eos> I want to know where he is, what he's up to, now.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> You can.<eos> You won't.
You should come with me.<eos> We could...<eos> We could leave tomorrow.<eos> Or tonight.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Maybe I need a change of pace too.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Uh, call me.<eos> Let me know.<eos> I will.
Killed?<eos> I was playing cards. Your shooter thought it was Judi Silver 'cause she was wearing Judi's wig.<eos> You killed the wrong whore.<eos> That's why God made extra bullets.<eos> Judi can't hurt you.<eos> She doesn't know anything.<eos> Don't do this, Ike.<eos> It demeans both of us.<eos> - You know how this works. - I can't let you kill her.<eos> I won't.

We entered into contract.<eos> You, as agent, should understand it.<eos> Have you ever heard of a holdout?<eos> Two wives?<eos> Six kids?<eos> I'd milk every penny I could get.<eos> What are you... ohh! No talking!<eos> Have you not heard of honor among thieves?<eos> We gave our word, Nathan Scott, that you would die.<eos> And so you will.
Lift your spirits. Half price.<eos> Make it full price.<eos> I bank with chase.<eos> My pin is "backstabber."<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> I'll say we just got in an accident.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Of course it will.
It's personal.<eos> I embarrassed you, Tom.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, Tony, it's OK.<eos> We were both going places once, weren't we?<eos> You got over your...bump in the road.<eos> Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony. You will.
What are you doing with him?<eos> I'm going to remake him.<eos> Remake him?<eos> Make him strong, fast, Like my children,<eos> Indestructible.<eos> For one final time, I'm going to tap into the dark magic I used a thousand years ago.<eos> Like my husband Mikael before him, I will make Alaric into a true hunter, the vampire to end all vampires.<eos> You can't create another original.<eos> What if he turns out to be an even bigger monster than your children?<eos> He won't,
Because I wanna know who I am.<eos> And the people who I came from, they did this and according to you, who we are is who we came from.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because it's ridiculous.<eos> Because if who we are is who we came from then I am destined to be the worst mother in the world.<eos> Who doesn't care about anyone but herself who can leave her children without a glance back.<eos> Okay, no, I didn't-<eos> Okay, and I won't do that to a child.<eos> I won't.
Dawn.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> I thought I'd join you all for dinner if that's all right.<eos> Brought a bottle of Pinot from France.<eos> I remember you saying that was your mother's favorite.<eos> How kind of you, Dawn.<eos> This is an excellent meal, as always, mother.<eos> Seriously, it's amazing.<eos> You need to teach me how to cook this, grandma.<eos> All right, I will.
It was all to protect you in this cruel palace<eos> I'm your mother<eos> Why'd you force me on the throne and turn me into someone who can't trust his mother?<eos> You can't trust me?<eos> You dare defy your mother!<eos> If you all meet, the truth will come out<eos> Guards!<eos> Bring Minister Yoon and Kwon-yoo at once!<eos> That won't happen!<eos> Yes, it will!

John Coniston!<eos> Manager of the month!<eos> Come on up here, shy man.<eos> Speech!<eos> Speech! 20 words.<eos> That's all we want.<eos> Ah, well, thank you, thank you everyone. Thank you very much.<eos> I um, well, I'm lucky, I suppose. I... ..have some good staff and they, they don't make too many mistakes.<eos> So I guess I'll be sharing this with them. Thanks very much, thank you.<eos> Bullshit you will!
No, we were not a good couple because he bugged me.<eos> He was never interested in anything I had to say.<eos> So now, you've found a pupil?<eos> That's not what I'm saying.<eos> Paul - he is curious, he's excited.<eos> He's um, yeah he's a nice guy. And he seems to really like me.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is my little secret, you can't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
What if I were to offer a ministry?<eos> Something that covers your areas of interest?<eos> What could that be, except prime minster?<eos> This isn't what we have spent all these months working for.<eos> It goes against all accords.<eos> But then they are well aware that they are top dog.<eos> If Zeeland really are threating to pull the plug there is not a damn thing we can do about it.<eos> You don't think this is right either.<eos> But I hope you will change your mind.<eos> I won't.
- What is it?<eos> - What? These shorts you wear won't look good in front of your sister-in-law. My sister-in-law?<eos> The one I think about all day. And she's made my internet bill soar.<eos> You're marrying Sunny Leone!<eos> I am...<eos> Simran. Like one of those heroines out of Yash Chopra, Raj Kapoor films. Now like today.<eos> Fakir, Panti...<eos> What's...<eos> You're marrying Simran? - Yes... She said yes.<eos> She will.
Why not try?<eos> You don't think I've considered it?<eos> Mother would never allow it.<eos> Suren and I would have to disappear.<eos> Two suitcases, 2 train tickets and never look back and she--<eos> She's not ready to give this up.<eos> You wouldn't have to run.<eos> Stay on Mother's good side.<eos> We can have what they have.<eos> And in a thousand years, we will.
- My husband, of course.<eos> Shake some reaction out of that great lump!<eos> Do you happen to have a cigarette?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now look here, don't be obtuse, Tietjens.<eos> Dammit, man, is the department's duty to support Waterhouse and make his case to the house.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Minister has to show the figures for the insurance bill will balance.<eos> Well, they won't.
Her father says no.<eos> I have to give her something.<eos> I'll give it to her.<eos> You go home and wait for her to ring you.<eos> OK?<eos> Here...<eos> Tell her I did my best, and tell her that Alo helped me cos he does computer shit on his PlayStation.<eos> All right.<eos> And tell her that you're a mean old cow who probably never gets laid.<eos> I will.
Mini, Mini!<eos> Tell him to stop!<eos> Mini!<eos> I don't want you here!<eos> I never wanted you at all.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Now get the fuck out, you deluded loser!<eos> I don't know what teenage drama you've got yourself embroiled in, but try for a bit more professionalism next time, OK?<eos> I'm so sorry, Gregory, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it fucking won't.
Well, miss a fucking class!<eos> This is important!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll sort it.<eos> Course.<eos> And Franky!<eos> You need to tell her.<eos> Tell her I'm coming home!<eos> Tell her I...<eos> I will.
Gloria came right out and said that she still loves me?<eos> Listen to her sing.<eos> Mr. Sherman, if I could be with Gloria again, it'd be worth being locked away all these years.<eos> I signed on to find a bullet...<eos> Not your reason to live.<eos> Enjoy the CD.<eos> So, what do you think would happen to you if you fail to find what you're looking for?<eos> It's never happened.<eos> What if it did?<eos> It won't.
- We shall see.<eos> Stark had you longer than I did.<eos> Lord Stark is gone.<eos> And how do you feel about that?<eos> What's done is done.<eos> I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.<eos> Who gave you those clothes?<eos> Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?<eos> If my clothes offend you, I will change them.<eos> You will.
Well, that must be very nice for you.<eos> -Do you love your wife?<eos> -l do.<eos> Yet you have known other women.<eos> Don't talk about my wife.<eos> I'm not. I'm talking about other women.<eos> Like me, Ser Davos.<eos> You want me.<eos> You want to see what's beneath this robe.<eos> And you will.
- How do you know?<eos> - That's his safety zone.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Marty, I want to go home!<eos> Marty!<eos> Marty, what are y...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> They all want me to change back.<eos> - But I won't.
Your bruise-- did somebody jump on you like that?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get away from here.<eos> Done.<eos> What do you mean, done?<eos> Does he know we were in his office?<eos> We didn't get to that part.<eos> I just told him football players talk a lot when they're not on the field.<eos> - Okay, Mona, he cannot know that we were...<eos> - He won't.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means we're gonna hit you where hurts, right in the...<eos> Cinnamon rolls.<eos> What?<eos> George, that geyser on your lawn caused extensive water damage to our driveway.<eos> And, sadly, we're gonna have to have the whole thing repaved.<eos> Ooh, that sounds expensive, George.<eos> Oh, it will be, and if George doesn't pay for it, we'll sue.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - But we will.
I won't ask, and you don't have to tell.<eos> (Under breath) But just so you know, you're barking up the wrong tree as far as Ryan Shay is concerned. He is... (Click teeth) straight as an arrow.<eos> But his body...<eos> It's so muscular.<eos> I know.<eos> And that's usually a telltale sign, but...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You do know.<eos> - You can't out me.<eos> - I won't.
Don't short-change me.<eos> It's eight bob, if I bring you inside.<eos> Thought he'd dropped off on the job.<eos> I tell you what, some of them lascars, they don't half rub off on you.<eos> Maw!<eos> You've got one in the oven.<eos> Is it any wonder?<eos> There's things you can do, Mare.<eos> Things you'll have to do.<eos> And what if I won't?
I agree with you.<eos> Vaya con Dios.<eos> Hey! Hey, man!<eos> I am an American.<eos> I'm an American!<eos> You can't do this to me!<eos> Yes, General?<eos> Your associate seems to be missing.<eos> Well, if you find him, have him give me a call.<eos> I will.
Now, that's not nice.<eos> - Tell 'em.<eos> - I set explosives on the main engine.<eos> What?<eos> Mech, you still have explosives?<eos> Some C4.<eos> Good.<eos> If we put C4 in the main engine, we can blow up the ship and the queen with it.<eos> We might not make it out in time.<eos> At least they won't.
I thought you're weren't back till 6:00.<eos> Uh, we got out early from rehearsals.<eos> I'm...<eos> Tess.<eos> Tess.<eos> Cat.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> What...<eos> What if she says something?<eos> She won't.
Right, Sutton?<eos> Mm-hmm. Your whole family's getting along, and mine's totally messed up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Phyllis took off.<eos> Look, just stay here, Char.<eos> Just stay with your aunt.<eos> No, I gotta go.<eos> My mom needs me.<eos> Okay, I'll come with you.<eos> We all will.
Goddamn.<eos> Damn.<eos> That's real good news.<eos> He's due.<eos> Fuck him.<eos> I'm due.<eos> Know what Dan would have said.<eos> I better help the new guy with the truck.<eos> He'll probably fuck it up.<eos> Fucking will.
Love you.<eos> I don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You said I would always be in your heart, and...<eos> That is too cruel a fate.<eos> Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me, because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else...<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
It creates happiness.<eos> And that man in the stables... you love him?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> Then you must marry him.<eos> I will go tell father right away.<eos> N-no. No. No.<eos> No. You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Surely he'll understand.<eos> Perhaps, but not everyone will.
It's nothing.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I wasn't looking where I was going.<eos> But he says he's fine.<eos> I'm fine, papa.<eos> Really.<eos> Are you sure, Bae?<eos> Yes. I'm fine.<eos> Well, I suppose it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Not easy, the older you get.<eos> Oh, don't I know it.<eos> Oh, Jesus God...<eos> Ah... Maybe. Let me see if I can get Jody.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> He's had 24 hours to run his mouth already.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He won't.
- What if we had a baby at home?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> What if we had a baby relying on us to come home, and something happened?<eos> Something?<eos> Something, anything.<eos> I don't know, we didn't come home.<eos> Who would raise the kids?<eos> What-what would happen then?<eos> Honey, we don't have a baby, let alone babies plural.<eos> Not now, but we will.
Yes, all right, then. - Sam. Sam.<eos> - Yo.<eos> Meet Dick.<eos> He's gonna be on the floor with us today.<eos> You are not to let him out of your sight.<eos> - Okay, welcome. How you doing? - How do you do?<eos> Sam, I need you to do me a favor.<eos> Can you hop on this trauma for me?<eos> If I stand next to Lenny, he'll totally pick up on my break-up vibes.<eos> - No, he won't.
Still totally hot.<eos> I've already seen this movie, and this pizza sucks.<eos> Sorry. Can I make you a grilled cheese?<eos> You can make me one.<eos> Where's Lip?<eos> God, you're so fucking hot.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.<eos> Shh. I don't want Ian to hear us.<eos> He won't.
Competition?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> High quality heroin.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> This bag left the Ali house with the younger brother after the unfortunate incident with the bottle and before the arrival of the emergency services.<eos> The 24 minute gap.<eos> They're all over it - fingerprints, DNA.<eos> Bag and contents.<eos> I won't ask how you...<eos> No, you won't.
Maybe you guys should spend a shift back here, see what it's like.<eos> Kind of like when you spend a night in your own guest room.<eos> Make sure it's up to scratch before you stick your mother-in-law in it.<eos> I don't have a mother-in-law.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't.<eos> Yeah, well, you might someday.<eos> You're right, McNally.<eos> Maybe I will someday.
Succinct.<eos> I wanted to make sure that we were really together first, that this was gonna stick.<eos> You know how she is.<eos> Hence the abject terror.<eos> You wanna tell Chelsea about us?<eos> But I also know that she'll go home and open that always-gigantic mouth of hers around Ithaca, which means it's just a matter of time before our parents are sobbing over the phone, insisting how they always knew we'd work things out someday.<eos> So I wanted to make sure that... you wanna tell Chelsea too.<eos> I wanna say the right thing here.<eos> Well, don't by--<eos> - No, I won't.
(Muttering in French)<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Arrête!<eos> (Groaning)<eos> (Groaning)<eos> (Vehicle passing by)<eos> (Gurgling)<eos> Please don't let me die.<eos> You don't wanna die?<eos> Well, you never will.
I'll walk.<eos> It might rain.<eos> Then I'll get wet.<eos> Now come and kiss me.<eos> So, if they can't find Mr... Pillbox, what will you do with the money?<eos> Pullbrook.<eos> And they will find him.<eos> But if they don't?<eos> Then I'll decide what to do.<eos> Or we will.
Fate?<eos> This is me. So you're leaving tomorrow?<eos> At the crack of dawn.<eos> But I was thinking I'd come back.<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, this place isn't exactly Buenos Aires.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But there is a lot more to Chance Harbor than the guidebooks suggest.<eos> Well, then you should come back.<eos> Well, then I will.
Because you did something you couldn't take back, and you didn't know if she would forgive you.<eos> I betrayed her.<eos> That is something that is with me every day.<eos> I tried so hard to make sure that she would have a real family, one that wasn't going to fall apart.<eos> Will it help you if I tell you that Greg is a good father?<eos> And if everything he says about Leslie... makes her sound like a great mother.<eos> You did the right thing, Ade.<eos> You couldn't keep her.<eos> Do you think she'll ever forgive me?<eos> She will.
He is a very important surgeon.<eos> Do you think one of those organizations maybe kidnapped him for ransom?<eos> Or they need a doctor.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Maybe he sent his new information to my old e-mail account at New York Hospital!<eos> I'm gonna check it.<eos> Uh, no, you won't.
Do you, uh, you wanna do chumley's next week?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Of course.<eos> The Ritz, please.<eos> Oh! Edward Vanderway.<eos> Lieutenant, U.S. Navy.<eos> - Serial number 653...<eos> - Knock it off.<eos> I'm never going to figure out lighting.<eos> Sure you will.
Go! Come on!<eos> Do you recall this?<eos> My body pressed against yours?<eos> You trembling helpless, as you tremble now --<eos> I am far from helpless.<eos> You think this makes difference?<eos> My death will not heal the scars you bear.<eos> Nor erase memory of my cock inside of her, or all those that followed.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
Is something wrong?<eos> We're estranged.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought the four of you were inseparable.<eos> I know, but something happened a few months ago, and...<eos> Bree?<eos> After everything we've been through, I promise you can trust me.<eos> I don't want you to know.<eos> You're the only one who still believes in me.<eos> And I always will.
I've dreamt about seeing you in your bridal gown Ever since you were a little girl.<eos> Well, you were never really little but you know, young.<eos> Hi, I'm colleen, your bridal consultant.<eos> Oh, you and I are going to be very good friends.<eos> Well, let's not start braiding each other's hair just yet.<eos> Okay, time to try dresses.<eos> Oh, not me, right?<eos> No, no--dresses no--oh, my god.<eos> No, mom, this is so crazy--we need to talk.<eos> And we will.
I'm never gonna see you again, am I?<eos> If you'd like to plan a vacation to some friendly, non-extraditing country, I'd be happy to set up a weekend for you.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It's real.<eos> I get that now.<eos> We're not gonna get that 1.6 million, are we?<eos> When the courts release it, it will go into your account for about nine minutes, and then it will mysteriously disappear.<eos> Don't try to stop it.<eos> - We won't accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
He's kicked off on an anger management course, for fuck's sake!<eos> This was my fault.<eos> Your fault?<eos> How's that?<eos> I haven't managed a problem.<eos> I've created one.<eos> All right.<eos> Get ready to jump out.<eos> If I get caught...<eos> You won't.
Is he going to get his conviction quashed?<eos> Is he going to stand on the steps of the Appeal Court with a big smile on his face?<eos> I'm quite sure that he will.<eos> But he may have to wait for a bit.<eos> Do you think he'll settle for that?<eos> I think he might.<eos> Come here.<eos> What will I do with myself?<eos> You'll figure something out.<eos> We will.

Thank you very much.<eos> Welcome to mini camp, gentlemen.<eos> Yeah, it's real.<eos> You made it, man.<eos> Welcome to my house.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> And to play alongside you?<eos> Just hope I can keep up.<eos> Eh, you won't.
Okay.<eos> Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.<eos> Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.<eos> His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him.<eos> His 60-foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12.<eos> Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.<eos> She has.<eos> Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't. - Yes.
I want to.<eos> I need to.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you for understanding.<eos> And for doing everything you could to help me with this.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> It means so much.<eos> I wish I could have done more.<eos> Oh, and Raj, please, give your parents my regards.<eos> I will.
What did he do to you?<eos> Your sergeant-<eos> - I mean, did he assault you?<eos> He raped me.<eos> Okay?<eos> My sergeant raped me.<eos> I think we can do without these.<eos> Right?<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
See you.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Lloyd.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's what you wanted me to write.<eos> Doesn't feel like you left anything out.<eos> It's good.<eos> And I have a copy, if you need it.<eos> You want me to read it?<eos> Not if you don't have to.<eos> Then I won't.
I know, baby.<eos> Because it feels like I'm giving up on you.<eos> I know that's not true.<eos> And I am not... giving up on you.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, screw it.<eos> I can't-I can't do this.<eos> I won't do this.<eos> I will not say good-bye to you.<eos> I won't.
You can forget about that.<eos> Who is disturbing me?<eos> "Beloved "<eos> What is it? How about a long-drive?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Wear your slippers.<eos> We'll be taking the car, not going bare-foot.<eos> "Beloved "<eos> By the way, you like driving, don't you? You know, so do I.<eos> You won't any more.
Uncle. Tihattar.<eos> - He's your brother.<eos> Bahattar Singh. Bahattar!<eos> - Tihattar!<eos> Tihattar!<eos> My brother!<eos> Brother, he's the right guy. Who will finish the last round?<eos> Come on, son.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I will.
It's what your job was, wasn't it?<eos> Roots... and wings.<eos> Then it's OK, because you know that they'll come back.<eos> When they're ready.<eos> So, you ask about boyfriends and... friends. But... the truth is,<eos> I didn't really know her very well in the last year or so.<eos> You know, she was out there.<eos> Making her own life.<eos> And she hadn't come back to us yet.<eos> And now she never will.
Okay, but let's keep an eye on him, yeah?<eos> I don't think the war's over for him yet.<eos> Why gold?<eos> It's the ancient elixir of life, the basis of alchemy.<eos> Τhey must have found a way to use it, a way to make those things out there.<eos> Τhat's why the gold was here.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Τhere must be more than this.<eos> I can't go back with nothing.<eos> You won't.
Do not fuck with me.<eos> Naomi Walling was having a relationship with Herreshoff.<eos> And it sounds like it didn't end well.<eos> Do you have any other conversations between them? No.<eos> This is the only one we picked up.<eos> I think you'll agree that I've given you everything you asked for.<eos> This call is a silver bullet for Ellen Parsons.<eos> She gets her hands on it, your case is sunk.<eos> Then she better not hear it.<eos> Oh, she won't.
We're gonna put out a full-length album and go on a bunch of tours.<eos> Stick around, touring just around Portland at different bars and stuff?<eos> Kevin wants to get out. Kevin?<eos> What are you talking about, Kevin?<eos> He's never seen New York.<eos> We want to take it as far as we can.<eos> I think you guys are gonna stay here because you're my band and you're not going anywhere.<eos> You don't think we should go on tour?<eos> Ok.<eos> Maybe we won't.
Are you in the front row?<eos> Did you get front row seats?<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - What's this?<eos> I'm an outlaw and the government has my family,<eos> - so I have to kill another outlaw.<eos> - No you won't.
Previously on Falling Skies...<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
Well, it's enough to make anyone Bolshevik, sending men and boys to murder each other in millions!<eos> I don't want a birthday if he's lying dead.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> He's in Glasgow.<eos> I meant...<eos> You are surely not in love with Christopher Tietjens?<eos> You mustn't be.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> But when he comes home, he will make me his mistress.<eos> Or he won't.
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> You sure it won't hurt him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's good for him, to be touched.<eos> Okay, I'm just going to try this and see how it goes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can get into bed with him.<eos> I'll mess up his lines.<eos> No, you won't.
But now, after this, I really don't give a shit about you anymore.<eos> You might not have my memory, but you better remember that.<eos> What the hell did you say to Daniel?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What matters is I don't ever want to see Mike Ross in this office again.<eos> - Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
No.<eos> Wilfred! I'll have a glass of Pinot.<eos> Just a club soda for Bear.<eos> Bear's back on the wagon.<eos> Five weeks sober. It's a miracle.<eos> Take my coat?<eos> Wilfred, Wilfred, I know what this is.<eos> You want to get to know Amanda better, but now isn't the time.<eos> I need everything to run smoothly tonight.<eos> And it will.
What the fuck kind of monsters are you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey there, baby.<eos> You're fine.<eos> Just don't shift.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> What the fuck are you doing out?<eos> - Shift.<eos> - I'm not gonna leave her.<eos> We won't.
Okay, look, okay, but you... you made it work.<eos> You always do.<eos> The patient is fine.<eos> Look, you can't control everything.<eos> I know you want to.<eos> But you can't, okay?<eos> Is Meredith all right?<eos> I don't know how to talk to her, Richard.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> Yeah, I will, I will.
You can't paint over bloodstains.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> A few hours ago, you promised me another 50.<eos> Now I hear I've been cut off.<eos> Why the change?<eos> I imagine you already know that.<eos> Well, I'm sure Raylan Givens paid you a visit, and you just pussed out.<eos> Nothing to do with the fact that you've spent the last 20 years looking for a way to hang me out to dry.<eos> I asked you to deal with the marshal, and you didn't deal with him.<eos> - Now I will.
To save my own life?<eos> That's why you'll never win!<eos> I'm not fighting for me!<eos> I fight for them!<eos> That's something you'll never understand, machine!<eos> It's the very thing that makes us human.<eos> Captain?<eos> AI designation: Vision.<eos> You are to surrender by the order of Iron Man.<eos> I... will... not!
Eddie.<eos> - Huh? - Come on.<eos> Man up.<eos> Move spa day.<eos> It would help pay for green dolphins.<eos> - Don't know what that means.<eos> - Again, man up.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I will have one of those beers.<eos> Yeah! Yeah, you will!
You're an alcoholic at a casino.<eos> You don't get any drinks.<eos> I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a compulsive gambler.<eos> And those dots aren't connected?<eos> Let me explain.<eos> You had a drink. You gambled. You lost your company.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> What I should do is walk through that door and make you live with this.<eos> Well, you won't, will you?
It will be a surprise.<eos> I have some magic.<eos> Do you wanna see it?<eos> Please?<eos> Okay, sit.<eos> Part of magic is suspense and expectation, right?<eos> What could it be?<eos> Voila.<eos> I didn't want to forget you.<eos> And I won't.
Or perhaps you are trying to sketch Maman?<eos> Isabelle.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have seen you when you think we are all asleep.<eos> Do you not want me?<eos> Do you not want to do those things to me?<eos> She is not even my mother.<eos> She need only say a word.<eos> She won't.
Previously on The Client List Kyle left me, and I have no idea if he's ever coming back.<eos> Bobby just texted me, and he's thinking we should just look around here and get married.<eos> Well, whose are these, anyway?<eos> Dee Ann.<eos> Me?<eos> This guy I'm seeing... It's just fun.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
She was a bit of a wallflower when I last knew her.<eos> Now you're gutted you let her go.<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> Hey, this one's very drinkable.<eos> It's a bit cheaper.<eos> This one's got, like, a biscuity flavour.<eos> It's more expensive.<eos> I don't think anyone's gonna notice the difference.<eos> Someone will.
Th-this is sexual harassment.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I think of it as sexual encouragement.<eos> Think about it, Kepner.<eos> Take one for the team.<eos> You got her the grant money.<eos> Look, I know you did.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> It'll help things between you guys.<eos> - No, it won't.
But I was good at scouting and history.<eos> And why?<eos> I'll tell you so you know.<eos> Dates...<eos> Dates. That's the key to knowledge.<eos> Weddings, funerals, uprisings - everything has a date.<eos> I'm good at dates.<eos> You won't stump me on anything. On any fucking thing, remember that.<eos> - Will you remember that?<eos> - I will.
It's all frozen.<eos> Can't access any of it.<eos> We're in the shit, Frannie.<eos> So, don't, don't call anyone, Adrian, associates.<eos> You got to keep your head down cos the sky's falling in.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Can't eat, can't sleep.<eos> Every time I look out the window, the police are there.<eos> Hey. They'll give up soon, all right, they'll go away.<eos> No, they won't.
- A man like Harper?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Five hundred thousand should do it.<eos> And you're suggesting I go and find £250,000 in cash, like that?<eos> Well, you're a billion-dollar-a-year company.<eos> That's just loose change.<eos> Hmm.<eos> So what are his options?<eos> Well, he could walk away.<eos> But he won't, will he?
Look, what is it with you lot?<eos> - He's very persuasive.<eos> It's the eyes.<eos> - Yes, it's definitely the eyes.<eos> Well, either that or you two are unbelievably gullible.<eos> And did Ridley recognise you from the hotel?<eos> Don't worry, son, we'll sort it.<eos> So what are his options?<eos> Well, he could walk away.<eos> But he won't, will he?
I'm not here to control you.<eos> I just want to keep you safe.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Look, Noelle, it is d...<eos> I know, okay?<eos> I... I get it.<eos> I got scared today. I actually got scared.<eos> I mean... some numb-nuts knocks me down, and all I can think about is losing what I never thought I'd have... so from on, I will ride the desk, all right?<eos> And I will even try and like it.<eos> No, you won't.
Let's go.<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> You cut that fine.<eos> Is it all there?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're not gonna die on me, are you?<eos> There are kids out there.<eos> It's all there.<eos> You can check it if you want.<eos> I will.
Just let me explain.<eos> I... No, I think this once I agree with your father.<eos> Going tonight is a really terrible idea.<eos> Wow, you, you always manage to abandon me when I need you the most.<eos> When did this become my fault?<eos> He's the one who cheated on his wife behind her back.<eos> He's the one who said he loved you and then disappeared when it got tough.<eos> I'm the one who found you barely alive.<eos> I hope you're not expecting me to thank you for that.<eos> Because I never will.
sitting at his house ready to grab him.<eos> Only one day.<eos> I-I-I can't wait that long.<eos> Bring Mr. Morris in.<eos> I want to have a chat with him.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Brenda, you have to go back to work at this hour?<eos> Mama, I am so sorry, but I've got a deadline.<eos> Hmm, I thought since Clay was feeling better, you and I could have a little talk.<eos> And we will.
I'm not asking.<eos> This isn't about work. It's about you and Peter.<eos> Eli, can we do this later?<eos> We're meeting with Donna Brazile this afternoon.<eos> She is going to decide if Peter is the keynote speaker at the Democratic Convention.<eos> - Really? - Really.<eos> Hey, I am a good campaign strategist.<eos> But I need to know if you're divorcing Peter.<eos> Donna Brazile will not agree to the keynote - if you are.<eos> - She won't...?
I... Who is this?<eos> FE Construction.<eos> You wanted me to reissue a check.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I said I'd get back to you, though.<eos> I know, but you didn't.<eos> So I decided to call you.<eos> Okay, um, let me get all my ducks in a row, sir, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Sir?<eos> No, you won't.
Turn around! Let's get out of here!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get out of my way! (Tires screeching)<eos> Move!<eos> You don't look like the law.<eos> I've been hearing that.<eos> Ralph: Name's Samantha Meade.<eos> She was found dead next to some motorcycle tracks.<eos> I got a man out there right now checking to see if those tracks match your tires.<eos> Which they will.
- Manchester!<eos> Who put you up to this?<eos> - Easy, Manchester.<eos> - Not chatty?<eos> Fine.<eos> Pokolistani tweaked about England's support of Bialya.<eos> You're killing them!<eos> Stop!<eos> Can't just let them get away with it, though, can we?<eos> We won't, but not like that.
Now I'm checking employee files at Petrosian Construction.<eos> - You hacked into his company?<eos> - "Hacked" is such an ugly word.<eos> And we have two more CCs.<eos> Chad Colombo, 40, a welder, unlikely to bear a child.<eos> And Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.<eos> Checking. Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.<eos> Get me an address.<eos> I'll go and talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
All right, call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> - It's too much.<eos> - Would you relax!<eos> This is still peanuts.<eos> We could move up to ten million before anyone else starts asking questions.<eos> Well, I'm not so sure.<eos> I think it's all happening too fast.<eos> What if they realise why we buy what we do?<eos> They won't.
No.<eos> - Did I wake you?<eos> I am having sex with my husband, Ruby.<eos> What is it?<eos> Walt just called.<eos> There's a situation at The Red Pony.<eos> Let him figure it out.<eos> It's your day off. I'm all he's got.<eos> I flew home especially to see you.<eos> And you will.
So big, in fact, that if you don't clear this up right now,<eos> Lamar Lewis and his friends in the Twilight Crips are going to think that your son shot Anthony.<eos> Diego didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> Sir, if you cooperate, we can make that clear to the people who want to kill Diego.<eos> But we need your statement.<eos> Hold on.<eos> If I help you, will you be sure that Diego gets to keep playing?<eos> Please.<eos> Will you help my son stay on the team?<eos> Yes, I will.
And to think that you wouldn't figure it out?<eos> Wouldn't exactly bring us closer together, would it?<eos> You know I love you, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't know if I believe you.<eos> You were at her house last night.<eos> I thought that if she knew how much I cared about you, then she would back down a little.<eos> But she never will.
Call the stakes, deal me in<eos> Devil take the hindmost<eos> Our Christine shall choose tonight Let her choose<eos> Is she yours or mine?<eos> Draw the line<eos> If she sings, you lose tonight I won't lose<eos> You leave from here?<eos> Disappear?<eos> Fine<eos> And if she won't?
We have all day before she has to feed, Damon.<eos> That's a day to exhaust every possible way out of this.<eos> There is no way out of it!<eos> We all know the drill...<eos> You feed or you die.<eos> There is no door number three.<eos> I was ready to die.<eos> I was supposed to die, I don't... I don't want... I can't be a vampire!<eos> If there's something that Bonnie can do, we have to try it.<eos> We will.
I'll believe that when I see it.<eos> Neil, do you want me to call your family?<eos> I'm sure they'd love to visit.<eos> Oh, don't worry about me, sunshine. My family came to say their good-byes the first two times.<eos> "We love you.<eos> We'll miss you." It--it was sweet, but I've heard it.<eos> I told 'em not to bother this time around.<eos> Okay. Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.<eos> I will.<eos> Okay. But I won't.
Smokers get a break, then I should, too.<eos> And that must be the famous attitude that Connie mentioned in her two-page, single-spaced diatribe to human resources about your work ethic. Or lack thereof.<eos> Hey.<eos> I do my job.<eos> I get paid to work from 9:00 to 5:00.<eos> Just because I don't come in early and stay late every day...<eos> And where were you last night?<eos> - McHale's bar. - Huh.<eos> - They know me. You can ask.<eos> - I will.
I dunno.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll drop you back off, then I'll have to nip out.<eos> Whatever.<eos> What happened?<eos> You forget about me?<eos> Something came up.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No...<eos> It won't.
Give us a minute.<eos> Still doesn't make sense.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'll live.<eos> You should be in hospital, Mia.<eos> I've broken more bones and spilt more blood than this before.<eos> I like you a lot, Ben.<eos> But it could never work.<eos> Why?<eos> It just won't.
You guess?<eos> Leo, come on.<eos> Ben didn't burn down the school and he didn't get kicked out of school or get anyone else kicked out.<eos> That's the best possible outcome. It's over! Congratulations!<eos> Oh, it's far from over.<eos> He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.<eos> He won't get in anymore trouble.<eos> He's not a bad kid. Dylan's still circling around.<eos> Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her.<eos> No, I won't.
I mean, she's gonna find out.<eos> Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.<eos> You replaced me with a tiger.<eos> I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you.<eos> But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
We're on our way now.<eos> That's not much time.<eos> Come on, man, you're CIA; you don't need time.<eos> You keep us alive.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Go on.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Hey, come on now, guys, huh? Look around.<eos> I don't think we want to be doing this for an audience.<eos> You made a big mistake, pendejo.<eos> This whore shit all over our club.<eos> Got my mom locked up.<eos> This is our get.<eos> We got to send a message, make sure the other pussy thinks about doing it.<eos> I will.
The best salesmen, they're the best liars.<eos> Are you lying to me, Mar?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - Thermite burns are nasty, huh?<eos> - I can explain.<eos> Mm, I can't wait.<eos> I've been using Billy to develop a more stable thermite.<eos> A patent could mean millions.<eos> If the thermite in your burn matches our victim...<eos> It won't!
He doesn't know where she is.<eos> What if Wilson...<eos> No, forget Wilson.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do...<eos> I'm gonna send a patrol car out to you right now, and you are going to stay put.<eos> No, I need to go out and find her.<eos> No, you need to stay put in case Lacey comes home.<eos> Get out there right now.<eos> I can't lose her, Bud.<eos> You won't.
And in your case, it's bullshit.<eos> There are not words ugly enough to describe what Kyle did to you and the kids.<eos> To walk out that door and leave you to fend for yourselves without so much as saying a word or giving you a clue?<eos> Okay, well, maybe he did give me clues, and I didn't see --<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> Don't you dare make excuses for Kyle Parks.<eos> You are way past that.<eos> I know.<eos> So, snap out of it, girl.<eos> I will.
If I'm right, that's where he'll head.<eos> He can't just have disappeared.<eos> I'm monitoring RSS.<eos> Patrol cars are running a street sweep spiraling outward from St Paul's.<eos> Alec!<eos> I've got feeds from all the CTV cameras,<eos> ATM and security cameras.<eos> There is no sign of Kagame so far.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> They will.
But now, after this, I really don't give a shit about you anymore.<eos> You might not have my memory, but you better remember that.<eos> What the hell did you say to Daniel?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What matters is I don't ever want to see Mike Ross in this office again.<eos> - Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
What?<eos> The, the, the, the running, the Olympics.<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, my God, how can you have missed it?<eos> Even coming from the airport, it's everywhere.<eos> Darling, it's been everywhere for five bloody years, hasn't it?<eos> Will we, won't we?<eos> Will it be built, won't it be built?<eos> Will we win?<eos> No, we won't.
It's funny.<eos> Some people never get to know the folks next door.<eos> They share a fence and nothing else.<eos> And we've shared everything.<eos> How did we get to be so lucky?<eos> I am so crazy nuts about you guys.<eos> Promise me this is not the last time we're gonna play poker together.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - We'll just have to make the time.<eos> - Of course we will.
Take him quietly and grab all his computer equipment.<eos> Nate, we have liftoff.<eos> Get it?<eos> 'cause of the...<eos> Yes. Yes, parker, I get it.<eos> Okay, eliot, hardison, kanack is sending muscle to the location.<eos> Make sure you beat him there.<eos> Yeah, we're on it.<eos> Not gonna win any races in lucille.<eos> Oh, we will with this.
Do you realize you'll be sleeping alone?<eos> Yes, I think about it every night.<eos> I can't sleep because you snore like a fog horn.<eos> I'm worried, all alone in that house...<eos> I won't be alone, Massimo will be there too.<eos> This Massimo!<eos> I don't see you together.<eos> Actually, I've never seen you together.<eos> - When can I meet him?<eos> - You will.
Those are some serious Competitors,man.<eos> for sure,definitely.<eos> I'd love to find an idol.<eos> yeah,me,too.<eos> That'd make me feel so much Better.<eos> I'm definitely glad to Actually be able to talk to you.<eos> When colton said to vote for You,I didn't really want that,You know?<eos> colton said that? yeah.<eos> Yeah. and... Don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.

Don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
I would directly ask him whatever I wanted.<eos> Exactly. I'm doing the same thing.<eos> People have always told me, that God is like a father-figure.<eos> But how can I believe, as long as I don't see Him.<eos> You're an atheist, how can God appear before you?<eos> Eat.<eos> Kanji bhai, even I believe that God's like a father-figure. - Yes.<eos> So, will he appear before me?<eos> Do you believe in temples, idols etcetera? Yes, I do.<eos> - Then He won't.
the cia has no jurisdiction here.<eos> come to think of it, you have no jurisdiction anywhere.<eos> i'm taking her into custody.<eos> it's a legitimate warrant, chief.<eos> mrs. winstone, would you come with me, please?<eos> get me everything you can on that guy.<eos> thanks for helping me, giancarlo, but you're not taking me back to rome, not while she's in ravello.<eos> the lawyer?<eos> cia couldn't make her talk.<eos> but you will?
Mase...<eos> We talked about this.<eos> She's not... she's...<eos> She's not coming home.<eos> She's dying.<eos> That w what you said last time in Seattle, but then the doctors fixed her.<eos> Right, but, Mason...<eos> They can't help your mom there any more.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> Somebody will.
What, has she got her martini goggles on again?<eos> Yeah, every once in a while, She goes through these periods<eos> Where she just gets super smashed And her judgment goes right out the window.<eos> I mean, she'll get on a tree stump And think it's a Kennedy.<eos> That's e... that's exactly what's happening.<eos> Well, it's all right.<eos> You just tell her.<eos> She'll have a laugh,<eos> Set fire to his car, and move on.<eos> I will.
You're just lucky I told your sister, because that girl does "not" want to have a party.<eos> Yeah, but Sloane always does stuff for me.<eos> I want to do something for her.<eos> Well, she said... and I quote...<eos> "I want to do absolutely nothing."<eos> OK.<eos> If that's what she wants to do, then we will do nothing.<eos> And don't say anything, because it's going to be a surprise.<eos> I won't tell her.<eos> And this time I really won't.
Yeah, you just...<eos> Didn't mention how different he was.<eos> Different than who?<eos> Or is "different" code for "young"?<eos> No. I... I don't have a problem with his age.<eos> Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other.<eos> Okay. Well... It's a good start, I guess.<eos> We'll talk. We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
You brought a civilian into your danger area without clearance.<eos> That's a breach, genius, and a major one.<eos> You're out of leverage, Ronnie. You do realize that, right?<eos> Oh... that is upsetting.<eos> And, jeez, if I get upset, I might not perform very well on the stand and...<eos> Well, that'd be bad for, gosh, everybody drawing a paycheck from Uncle Sam.<eos> You do realize that, right?<eos> You listen to me, you lowlife SOB.<eos> Whatever you've got up your sleeve is not gonna work, not today.<eos> It will, though.
Mr. Ferguson.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr. Durant don't need you.<eos> Like hell he don't.<eos> He asked for me himself.<eos> And he's paying me.<eos> Just like he pays you.<eos> Only difference being, I don't got to kill nobody.<eos> So when you coming back?<eos> Maybe I won't.
In a manner of speaking.<eos> What evidence does this person have?<eos> As soon as I have more information, I'll let you know.<eos> Your performance in the deposition left a little to be desired.<eos> Well, I was blindsided.<eos> Yeah, but you're our witness now.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> We need to prepare you for anything that Ellen Parsons might throw at you.<eos> And what if she asks about Torben and Herreshoff?<eos> She won't.
All right, maybe he's an egomaniac, and maybe he got a little rough with Naomi Walling in that hotel room. But I don't really believe that he tried to harm her.<eos> And you got nothing to show that I'm wrong.<eos> Well, I appreciate your opinion.<eos> You know, it's not enough that you're wasting your time, you're risking 30-plus years of your reputation.<eos> You think you can beat Ellen Parsons with nothing, but what if you lose, Patty?<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Find out who's funding Channing McClaren.<eos> Channing wants to tell Ellen Parsons about you.<eos> That cannot happen.<eos> It won't.
Let's get to work.<eos> Gary, we could use your help.<eos> - Agent Bell.<eos> - Okay, Agent Bell, can you download all the digital files from the investigation? Download.<eos> That's a waste of my ability.<eos> Hey, man, my guys could do it, but it'd take them hours.<eos> You can do it in ten minutes. Ten minutes.<eos> I could do it quicker than that.<eos> Great.<eos> So will you?
Listen to me.<eos> I get wanting to do anything you can for your family.<eos> I get it.<eos> You know, you're doing this because you feel a sense of... of responsibility and guilt.<eos> But I am telling you, no matter how hard you try, you won't bring Corinne up.<eos> She'll bring you down.<eos> And that makes me scared for you.<eos> Well...<eos> I made a promise to my sister that I'd never give up on her.<eos> So... I won't.
I'm gonna behave in class.<eos> I'm gonna read books instead of watch too much TV.<eos> And I'll eat green beans.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> I love you, too, Mason.<eos> Coop.<eos> Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
Hey, get away!<eos> Dad?<eos> Hey, stay away from him!<eos> Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.<eos> This isn't about the money. I just want justice for my father.<eos> Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed. Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
I so did not pee on her Emmy.<eos> Because I would never do that.<eos> Yeah, I pulled it out, but I never peed.<eos> Never.<eos> Never!<eos> Well, if I dribbled, I'm sorry, but come on.<eos> It was ten years ago!<eos> You really won't give me her number?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You really won't?
My God, that's awful.<eos> He had me scare shitless.<eos> I thought he was going to do something to me in the car.<eos> I can't believe he said he'd do that.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> He'd throw acid in my face.<eos> Even thinking of now I'm shaking.<eos> Poor Siobhan.<eos> You won't say anything to her, will you not?<eos> I won't.
Please Janet. I'm going clean. I am, I swear.<eos> I was having one last hit before the programme.<eos> You must think I'm stupid!<eos> No Janet, I don't.<eos> I swear, it's so you don't have any so you can do it clearly.<eos> You say that was the last one and you remember what it was like.<eos> I swear, that was it. That was the last one.<eos> Please Janet, I don't have anywhere to go to. No.<eos> I'd lose my job.<eos> You won't.
No! No!<eos> Hey, morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> What's all this?<eos> That, uh, pediatrics practice in Providence made me an offer yesterday.<eos> Are they okay with the hand?<eos> Yeah. I'd finish the rehab up there.<eos> They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.
Oh. That makes me very happy, Tara.<eos> My partners will be thrilled.<eos> And of course, we'll keep it off the radar until you say otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll talk to Margaret and start the paperwork.<eos> Okay. That sounds great.<eos> Can you hear my voice, Mr. Delaney?<eos> Oh, man, you should've just kept going.<eos> I know you want to die.<eos> And you will.
I thought you were in trouble.<eos> Any trouble that I've found is of your doing.<eos> My father would still be alive if you hadn't helped those cops.<eos> - He knows us.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> How do you know us, Alec?<eos> From the news.<eos> That must be it.<eos> - We should...<eos> - We will.
Mr. McLean.<eos> McLean?<eos> Jeremiah McLean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Out of me way!<eos> Sim! Where's your man McLean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He always seems to wander off when new stock comes in.<eos> Tell him I want to see him.<eos> I will, detective.
She's trouble with a capital T.<eos> You don't love her, you two don't even know each other.<eos> We're getting to know each other.<eos> I don't like that she shows up here unannounced with her friends and brings pot with her.<eos> It bothers you when people show up unannounced?<eos> You like Henry, he's been showing up for years unannounced.<eos> He doesn't bring pot with him when he comes.<eos> I don't like her parents showing up unannounced, snooping around.<eos> Henry's parents have never shown up unannounced.<eos> And they never will.
Who were you talking to?<eos> Just some girl I met at the party.<eos> Dylan.<eos> Dylan, huh?<eos> Well, that's an interesting name.<eos> Interesting girl. And she's a redhead.<eos> I love redheads.<eos> So ask her out.<eos> I'm going to.<eos> I will.
It's a text from my mom.<eos> Remember we asked her to find out who leaked the video of Payson kissing Sasha?<eos> And?<eos> It was Lauren.<eos> Honey... breathe.<eos> Thanks for making this happen so last minute.<eos> No worries. Nothing I like more than making dinner for six unexpected house guests.<eos> This is getting serious, Annie.<eos> - I really could lose this job.<eos> - But you won't.
The fella next to him didn't even flinch.<eos> Doesn't even break a sweat.<eos> We know he's ex-military, but still...<eos> His name is Matthew Downs.<eos> That's what he told Rossi and he wasn't lying.<eos> History shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> You see that?<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> We will.
Whatever.<eos> I kept telling you. I kept telling you to come over.<eos> You never told me to come over here.<eos> I did.<eos> I told you a bunch of times...<eos> And then I stopped. Well, it's not exactly easy for me to get here from work, so...<eos> It's not that hard.<eos> I take the bus to the train.<eos> Yeah, well, you never sleep here.<eos> - So... - Well, I will now.
Sexual assault.<eos> Yeah, we should talk to that desk clerk, see if she heard anything.<eos> Do you mind taking care of that?<eos> There's something I need to follow up on.<eos> Yeah, go do what you have to do.<eos> Hey.<eos> I-I parked far away, I left all of my electronics at work.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'll...
She's gone!<eos> - Heather?<eos> - No.<eos> Stormfly.<eos> Little miss innocent stole my dragon!<eos> Oh, this is bad.<eos> This is bad, this is bad, this is bad!<eos> This is catastrophic.<eos> - If Alvin gets that book...<eos> - He won't.
You can trust me.<eos> - Daddy. - .' Go, go... .'<eos> - You promised you'd stop smoking. - .' Go, Santa, go, go... .'<eos> I will, honey bunch, January 1st.<eos> It'll be my New Year's resolution.<eos> I love you.<eos> At least one of my girls is still sweet.<eos> Now you go get ready for bed, okay?<eos> Only if you say good night.<eos> I will.
Lev Shapiro, you know Sophie?<eos> Of course.<eos> Still beautiful.<eos> - How is the publishing business?<eos> - You know, not good.<eos> How's sculpture?<eos> Amazing-ng-ng.<eos> Oh. My boyfriend likes that artist you work for.<eos> - Tell your boyfriend he can talk to me if he wants to buy something.<eos> - I will.
You'll learn Japanese.<eos> We can videochat.<eos> Twenty-first century.<eos> What up?<eos> - My computer doesn't have that.<eos> - New places are good for you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You should travel, Fran.<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
Shh. Welcome home, Carly.<eos> Oh, man, it looks like we got trouble.<eos> What?<eos> Some cops came by the shop looking for you.<eos> - They say what for?<eos> - No, no.<eos> But Marty gave 'em your address.<eos> So what? We're not there. Well, they sure as hell know about Hayden, and they knew to look at the shop, so you might want to be a little more concerned.<eos> We have to finish this.<eos> We will.
Van Ness rotation.<eos> Very exciting.<eos> Whole hospital's talking about it.<eos> You don't look excited.<eos> Well, I convinced Kinney to let me do it and now I have to do it.<eos> That's usually how it works, doctor.<eos> Yeah, this kid's 24 years old.<eos> He's got his whole life ahead of him.<eos> I can't screw it up.<eos> You won't.
Or somebody else.<eos> Got it.<eos> She was waiting for me to tell her that I had figured out how Pelant framed her for the murder of Ethan Sawyer.<eos> Which I have not been able to do, yet.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna go to the next grave on your list, and you're gonna leave a flower that says, "Surrender yourself to the FBI."<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will arrest you.<eos> Oh, cut that out, now.<eos> You will not.
I wanted him... disbarred, unemployed, homeless.<eos> But you were there.<eos> You had motive.<eos> I peeked in the window, and then I left.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> I went to work.<eos> I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.<eos> I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.<eos> You can check surveillance.<eos> I will.
They were the first artists to break top 5 in pop radio with no label.<eos> But if you talked to Matt Drouin who manages Metric, he will tell you: "We had more people working on that record than if we were at a label.<eos> We just hired them ourselves so, no, we didn't have a label but we kind of built our own staff around it."<eos> When I got off the label, I pretty much knew I didn't want to sign with another one.<eos> And I knew nothing could beat doing direct business with my fans, it wasn't...<eos> There was no deal in the world that was that good.<eos> I cannot tell you how many emails I've got from fans saying:<eos> "We want to directly support you. How can we do it so your label doesn't get the money?"<eos> Give people awesome music and then make it very easy for them to help you.<eos> And they will.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Allow him to speak.<eos> I want my bean.<eos> Let me tell you how it works on my ship.<eos> I make the demands.<eos> You follow them.<eos> The bean's now mine.<eos> You have to give me something for it.<eos> Oh, I will.
Then everybody did.<eos> Suddenly, I was Mayor Lavon Hayes.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, sometimes I feel... adrift... myself.<eos> Well, I, um... I better go.<eos> What?<eos> My grandpa has me on a curfew.<eos> I know, it's humiliating, but...<eos> Good night, Lavon.<eos> Don't take these without food, and if it happens again, just give me a call.<eos> Thanks, I will.
They'll come after me again and again.<eos> You know that's true.<eos> Dad there are more kids out there, kids who had their harnesses removed but had their spikes serving with other resistance units.<eos> Someone has to reach out, convince them the rebellion is the best chance...<eos> How can you be so damn sure?<eos> When that Overlord invaded my mind he couldn't keep his thoughts completely walled off.<eos> Two-way street.<eos> I saw, felt what these aliens are all about.<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
I care about all of you.<eos> I know how tempting it is, but I'm not going to let you go down that road, letting yourself be seduced by an artifact--<eos> Claudia, that's just a path to destruction!<eos> And I've seen it.<eos> You've seen it! With MacPherson, with H.G., with Sykes.<eos> I'm not them.<eos> They weren't them either until they became them.<eos> No!<eos> No, she did not use the metronome.<eos> And she won't.
Let's just hope he's right.<eos> Kim, a juror spoke to us.<eos> That's grounds for a mistrial.<eos> Not if we keep our mouths shut.<eos> I have never wanted to win so badly.<eos> But under the rules of professional conduct we have to report the juror communication to the judge.<eos> If the judge declares a mistrial, who knows what happens with a new jury.<eos> Since when are you such a stickler for rules, anyway?<eos> - The point is, if this gets out...<eos> - It won't!
In fact, Cameron and her partner won the whole tournament.<eos> Wow, that's great.<eos> She must've been happy you were there for her.<eos> So... are we on for a jog Monday morning?<eos> 'Cause I gotta say, I miss my workout partner already.<eos> Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um... Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family...<eos> I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
This is not a purely political decision, Frank.<eos> I know it's not.<eos> We'll agree to disagree, Commissioner.<eos> Mr. Mayor... if you go out there on TV and announce this to the public, those three terrorists will burrow so far underground, they will come out on the other side of the world.<eos> And hopefully, they'll stay there.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> These aren't mercenaries, Mr. Mayor. They're radical fundamentalists, they're messianic.<eos> And they still have the virus, and they will come back here... and they will try it again and again and again.<eos> And we will face those challenges, Frank, as they present themselves.<eos> No, we won't!
You will lose everything... your job, your reputation.<eos> You will be disbarred.<eos> Unless I'm innocent.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> You have access to Doran.<eos> You could obtain the kind of documentation that would put him in a cell right next to his good friend Bernie Madoff.<eos> Whatever it is you're asking me to do, I won't do it.<eos> Take a day. Think about it.<eos> We don't want to ruin you.<eos> But we will.
Baby, how about we skip out on this shindig and we go watch the game somewhere?<eos> Well, now I know something's wrong.<eos> You wanted to go to the mayor's house since I met you.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I wouldn't miss tonight for the world.<eos> And you look beautiful.<eos> Babe, we're gonna be late.<eos> I guess she told you I'm the notorious Drake thief.<eos> Actually, no, she didn't.<eos> And I won't.
Are you?<eos> I should have thought a little sober reflection would not have gone amiss.<eos> Mama, let's try to be positive.<eos> Of all of them, Anthony Strallan is the most traditional choice.<eos> Robert, Edith is beginning her life as an old man's drudge.<eos> I should not have thought a large drawing room much compensation.<eos> Why dwell on that now?<eos> Because I want the pleasure of saying "I told you so".<eos> Now, the moment you feel tired, you're to tell me and I'll take over whatever it is you're doing.<eos> Oh, will you, now?
I'll go to London today.<eos> I'll arrange an interview.<eos> I won't come home till I've seen Short.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know it's right.<eos> For him.<eos> And for Sybil and this family.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Let me know if Sybil gets in touch.<eos> She won't.
I believe I can make Downton safe for our children, if we ever have any.<eos> But I can only do it if you're with me.<eos> But what about Papa?<eos> I do love him.<eos> Love him by all means, but believe in me.<eos> There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
I'm losing myself, Peter.<eos> I'm losing the man that you helped me become.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm not going to let that happen.<eos> We need you.<eos> You are our only hope to defeat the Observers.<eos> And I'm gonna be here with you every step of the way.<eos> Please, son.<eos> Whatever happens don't let me go.<eos> I won't, Dad.
Just tell Hoylake I'm sick.<eos> Let's be having you, chum.<eos> This is the terminus<eos> - Dufton.<eos> Dufton, aye.<eos> Unless you want to pay the bob back and make a day of it.<eos> Hello.<eos> I used to live here, you know. The Lamptons.<eos> Do you remember them?<eos> Your Mum and Dad will.
Hey, you got a lot on your mind.<eos> Nathan, that burned body that we found this morning?<eos> Turns out that it was the real Detective Tommy Bowen.<eos> - What?<eos> - He was killed and buried five weeks ago, when the first Tommy Bowen came to town.<eos> So who were we working with this whole time?<eos> Some Troubled person impersonating Tommy and killing people with a bolt gun who was also looking for my son.<eos> I got this.<eos> You go find whoever...<eos> We will.
They go to the cops, we go to prison.<eos> Do you want to go to prison?<eos> Just give me the little bird, and we're gone.<eos> We don't want anything to do with the rest...<eos> How about you sit down?<eos> Yeah, no way you're taking leggy.<eos> This isn't about the bird, Skeezer!<eos> Stop acting all gangsta, dude.<eos> You're not going to kill anybody.<eos> Maybe I will.
No. The problem is, Tom Klapperich, he's like you.<eos> He thinks he knows better than everyone.<eos> The truth is, he doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.<eos> He needs to declare bankruptcy, and he doesn't want to hear that.<eos> Let me keep him in the family in exchange for backing Jessica.<eos> Well, you close him.<eos> Then, we'll talk. That's not so reassuring.<eos> You came to me. I didn't come to you.<eos> I'll see you on the first tee.<eos> No. You won't.
Okay, neither were the Navajo.<eos> - One of our many snubs.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh!<eos> Fun factoid.<eos> At the time of the first Thanksgiving, our Serbian ancestors were having a Thanksgiving of their own.<eos> They were thanking God for sparing them from the wolves while giving each other the plague.<eos> That fact wasn't fun, was it?<eos> Oh, you'll get 'em next time, kiddo.<eos> She will not.
Public place.<eos> Bloemenmarkt, noon today.<eos> If you're trying to call my bluff, know that I've killed before.<eos> The only way you're gonna get what you want is if you go with my plan.<eos> I'll see you at noon.<eos> We're on.<eos> You got quiet all of a sudden.<eos> I know, I just...<eos> I want this to work.<eos> It will.
How can I know what you know?<eos> How can I know what I know will help you?<eos> You're testing me.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't have issues with authority figures.<eos> You know you're the smartest person in most rooms.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Am I required to tell you?<eos> Well, I'm just a consultant. You don't have to tell me anything.<eos> Then I won't.
- Please don't.<eos> - Don't what?<eos> Don't take away your right to be a victim?<eos> Point out how pathetic you're being right now?<eos> Riley, I swear, I will mess you up.<eos> Try it.<eos> Try.<eos> Get out of that chair right now and punch me.<eos> At least you can.<eos> - Well, maybe I will.
You are not the savage.<eos> We are. We humans are vulgar, violent, and, above all, never to be trusted.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> He killed Steve.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ah, that was uncomfortable for all of us.<eos> I can't believe I killed the real Bigfoot.<eos> He was completely innocent, as are all animals.<eos> How will I ever forgive myself?<eos> You probably won't.
No, why did you drop acid?<eos> I'm desperate to remember the plan before he completely takes over.<eos> Who are you talking about, Walter?<eos> Nina and I made an arrangement.<eos> What kind of arrangement?<eos> She promised that when I finished the plan to defeat the Observers, she would help me remove the pieces of brain that they put back in.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea, Walter.<eos> I don't want to lose you, Peter.<eos> I don't want to lose any of you.<eos> And you won't, Walter.
- Hmm?<eos> Oh, well, that's just a little one.<eos> The point is, this quilt is going to unite the Wyatt clan.<eos> It's beautiful, and it won't.<eos> Everyone, before everyone else gets here, I'd like to make a little toast.<eos> My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.<eos> And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us.<eos> Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it.<eos> Ben, don't you dare hurt her.<eos> I won't.

I found the latch. And I survived in my brother's place.<eos> If only my brother had known about that latch.<eos> If only he had had someone to tell him it was there.<eos> If only he had been lucky enough to save himself.<eos> If he'd had any one of those three, my brother wouldn't have died.<eos> It's the people without those three who lose first.<eos> I don't know which of the three you have.<eos> But you've been spared because you do.<eos> You mustn't forget that.<eos> I won't .
2006.<eos> Amanda, you need to know these details.<eos> Mason's gonna try to confuse you with these questions.<eos> How am I supposed to tell him I paid for all this?<eos> A generous patron from the club.<eos> I've written down specifics about him, too.<eos> Though hopefully, you won't have to go there.<eos> What if he doesn't buy it?<eos> What if he starts digging deeper?<eos> He won't.
Don't be crass.<eos> You're skulking.<eos> Women of your generation are graceless.<eos> It's an affront to nature.<eos> Mediocre surgeons will see you and feel themselves wilting in your shadow.<eos> Do not shrink to console them.<eos> Do not look for friends here.<eos> You won't find them.<eos> None of these people have the capacity to understand you.<eos> They never will.
People think it's killing that I like, but murder's just an act.<eos> It's all about the anticipation, the planning.<eos> Watching you and your daughter taking a walk, you and Beckett making love...<eos> Standing in your living room, being inside your life,<eos> knowing that I'm gonna take it all away from you... that's what I like.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?<eos> You think that they're gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?<eos> Beckett will.
Do you mind taking a taxi home?<eos> Uh, sure, no problem.<eos> I'd drive you, I just have some things to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... then we're done here?<eos> I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> All righty then.<eos> You know, uh, we should do this again.<eos> Oh, we will.
On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.<eos> Welcome to Long Island, Tex.<eos> Amy deserves better.<eos> You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them.<eos> She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.<eos> Yeah, that she is.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm a callous egomaniac.<eos> She's gonna leave me.<eos> No, she won't. No, she won't.
Don't make me rat out my own mom.<eos> Snitches get stitches.<eos> I'm not asking you to be a snitch. I'm asking you to do what's best for you and your daughter.<eos> You want her to be the little pilgrim, don't you?<eos> What do I have to do? I don't have to beat up my own mom, do I?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You are gonna wear a wire.<eos> You cheated.<eos> Prove it!<eos> Oh, I will.
The frankfurter turf war got kind of messy.<eos> I better go take a bite out of crime, sir.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I gave him my mom's number and he gave me two courtside tickets to the Bulls game.<eos> Courtside?<eos> Well if it doesn't work out with your mom, does he like old black ladies?<eos> Because my grandma will do a lot more for a lot less.<eos> These are the best seats ever.<eos> You know, if we wanted to, we could actually trip the guys on the other team.<eos> But we won't, right?

It's so hard not to trip them now, because I'm-I'm thinking about it.<eos> I won't, I won't, I won't.
Where do you think I bought that crock-pot?<eos> My wedding present?<eos> Really?<eos> I remember you. Got me down to four dollars.<eos> Your overbearing nature is legendary.<eos> We're not here to kiss each other's asses, madame butterfly.<eos> We're here to do business.<eos> She's not taking a penny less than ten bucks for that blender.<eos> But for $15, you get back your crock-pot, and you can take home these penis-shaped ice cube trays.<eos> $11. $12, and we'll...
Our agreement remains.<eos> We are going to Storybrooke together.<eos> I'll get it back.<eos> I don't have time for your games.<eos> I've crossed through too many worlds to be brought short at the brink of success.<eos> Who was it who bested you?<eos> The swan girl.<eos> Emma.<eos> Rest assured, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
And I'll be waiting.<eos> You're going to this Netherworld?<eos> I faced you.<eos> How bad could it be?<eos> It's not as simple as that.<eos> You can't get there.<eos> You haven't been under a sleeping curse.<eos> Well, then put me under one.<eos> If we do that, there's a chance you might never waken up.<eos> Sure, I will.
- and now he's trapped.<eos> - Okay, slow down.<eos> David is trapped in there?<eos> I have to get back.<eos> There's only one way to help him.<eos> True love's kiss.<eos> Yes, but it won't work in there.<eos> We have to get back.<eos> If we don't...<eos> We will.

You'll quash the suit if she does?<eos> No, I'll quash the suit if she's successful.<eos> She needs to convince two of the three swing votes for the FCC to drop their fine.<eos> She does that, she doesn't pay a cent.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> I know.<eos> That's not the concern.<eos> The concern is her.<eos> She won't go?<eos> No, she will.
Well, we'll, let you have some time alone.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> We were just leaving. We've been here a while.<eos> I guess I'll see you in a couple weeks.<eos> Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> Right now you have nothing to compare it to.<eos> But you will.
I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing, like I did. Walk away.<eos> I doubt Rex will want to be with you anyway when he finds out you're not even the mother of his child.<eos> He hasn't even got a child.<eos> He'll hate you when he finds out all those years of lies.<eos> It's unforgiveable, darling.<eos> You'll destroy them.<eos> I've worked so hard to keep them safe.<eos> Biba, if you care about either one of them, you will not tell them the truth.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I won't.
Oh, God, if I wasn't catholic and didn't have two kids and I didn't have a dentist appointment tomorrow that would be so rude to cancel this late, I'd kill myself.<eos> I know, I'll send him a text and tell him it was all a joke.<eos> Oh, I don't know, Melanie.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> This is good, this is good.<eos> I'll say it was an elaborate prank.<eos> I punked him.<eos> And send.<eos> That'll fix it.<eos> No, it won't.
Yeah.<eos> Do you wanna watch the news?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sure.<eos> You are not going to grow old alone.<eos> You're never alone.<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's blackmail.<eos> That Bible-thumping bitch is blackmailing me, and I don't want to give in to her.<eos> I won't.
She was taking the pictures.<eos> I've been racking my brain for the past three days, but I can't recall the name of the place.<eos> Ally would know.<eos> But she hasn't answered me in a while.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is for you.<eos> I keep hoping that I can will her to wake up.<eos> None of the doctors can agree as to when that might be.<eos> But as long as a chance exists, I can't give up.<eos> I won't.
And I brought you some-- some clothes, you know, and stuff you might need.<eos> And then I made you a sandwich.<eos> Still like ham and cheese?<eos> Your favorite?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, well, you need to take care of yourself, son.<eos> Okay. Well, okay, just, um, please... Tell her I love her.<eos> - I will, dad.<eos> - Please.<eos> I will.
Listen carefully, for I will not repeat!<eos> - The wedding is canceled ...<eos> Hulijane, can you hear me?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> If necessary, grab the ears Ricardo and drag him to the altar!<eos> For no one, no one will leave Julia in the lurch!<eos> Let's clear!<eos> No I was called Salome!<eos> Just to make it even more lacking!<eos> Will walkie-talkie?

Not even you could hope to thwart such magic.<eos> It would take a power as ancient as the dragons themselves.<eos> No.<eos> There must be something that we can do, Gaius.<eos> Only the Sidhe possess such magic.<eos> In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power.<eos> You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
Then this isn't going to be simple.<eos> I guess.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's here.<eos> Hang on!<eos> Before that, I have something to tell you.<eos> Actually, I am not a courier.<eos> A reporter?<eos> Aren't you going to negotiate with him?<eos> You will for sure.
Maybe I want to give the village another chance.<eos> I just need to learn, you know, just how to roll with it, like Johnny does.<eos> No, no, you can't go to the village again.<eos> Maybe you can make them see that we could be friends.<eos> No, that isn't possible.<eos> Well, you can't be sure.<eos> It's all in how you present yourself.<eos> - No, that won't make a difference!<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because it just won't!
Shut up.<eos> And we're going to meet guys with strange foreign accents, handsome dangerous guys who are like international spies or something.<eos> - In Venice, Italy.<eos> - Why Venice?<eos> Well, it's more romantic than Texas.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> It was all I could think of at the time, okay?<eos> Meg?<eos> Do you really think I'll meet someone...<eos> - Yeah, you will. - ...someday?
They've been scrubbed.<eos> This will do.<eos> I have one more thing to pass on.<eos> Our superiors are worried, and they want to accelerate the schedule.<eos> I told them I work on my own schedule.<eos> I've planned this out with extreme precision.<eos> Your arrival today has thrown everything off.<eos> It was just four minutes.<eos> I'll tell you what, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
I'm--I am so sorry.<eos> This is so unprofessional.<eos> Chris... Chris was so lucky to have such a loving mother like you.<eos> Aw, that is so sweet of you to say. Eh...<eos> All right, um... If you think exhuming his body would help.<eos> But could we please get this over quickly?<eos> Rachel, are you all right with this?<eos> I need you to be honest with me... I know I lost it in there, Dr. Rosen.<eos> I will not let that happen again.<eos> But it will.
You don't.<eos> Okay. I don't give a shit about friendship, this situation, or the past.<eos> Major League Baseball thinks the way I think.<eos> You're not gonna win.<eos> And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.<eos> You're never gonna get another job after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.<eos> You'll have to explain to your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.<eos> I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.<eos> Fuck you, Billy.<eos> Now I will.
Maybe we can find some other way, with nets or something.<eos> Nets?<eos> Oh, that's a great plan.<eos> And meanwhile, Belladonna's going to get raped and die!<eos> We don't know for sure if she'll die.<eos> Is this a joke to you?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I shouldn't even be here.<eos> We've almost been killed multiple times.<eos> I will probably die on this quest.<eos> Courtney definitely will.
I was wondering who you told about our little arrangement.<eos> No one.<eos> - He's telling the truth.<eos> - Good. Well, I guess we're done here.<eos> Let's wrap things up, shall we?<eos> Oh, I knew better than to trust you.<eos> Now, you let me walk out of here with my money, or I will pull this pin, and we all die.<eos> Go ahead. Pull it.<eos> I'll do it, I swear to God.<eos> No, you won't.
Hey. Watch that teeth.<eos> Are you gonna be a hero?<eos> All right.<eos> Come on. Check that kick.<eos> Easy.<eos> Come on, Dog, you can do it.<eos> Let's go, come on.<eos> -Good jab.<eos> Good jab! -There we go!<eos> No, he won't.
I really need help.<eos> Look, you're the valedictorian, all right.<eos> You have a 4.0.<eos> I copy off of you in calculus.<eos> Why would you want me to write you a paper?<eos> It's not a paper.<eos> It's my graduation speech.<eos> Save your money.<eos> No one gives a shit about those things.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom will.
So?<eos> Um, so... this old man he goes to the doctor, and he brings his wife along.<eos> It's the yearly physical, so the doctor says:<eos> "I just need a urine sample, a blood, a sperm and a stool sample."<eos> The old man can't hear very well, so he looks over to his wife "What?<eos> What is he saying?"<eos> "He wants your underwear!"<eos> My work here is done.<eos> So, I have to go back to New York for a few days, but call me if you need anything.<eos> Okay, I will.
- 밳our father won't give me horses?<eos> - Stop, why repeat my lines?<eos> - My sister...<eos> - You have no sister!<eos> - It's not true!<eos> I know it by heart. - 밫he Seagull?<eos> ..<eos> - Masha! Masha, confidently:.<eos> 밐e will, ask him for them...<eos> He will.?
You need a bath.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll guest so. Running the bath.<eos> So...<eos> My mom says you see them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are their older?<eos> No, no.<eos> You can tell them how much I miss them?<eos> I will.
What the fuck is going on, Johnny?<eos> They don't know anything, Jim. They don't know nothing about this.<eos> This is life.<eos> Everything you, you want or care about in this world... it ends up nowhere, right?<eos> My mom says she's gonna put me back in the hospital.<eos> It's like they're always trying to get rid of me or something.<eos> But when I get out, I'm gonna get a job.<eos> I'm gonna get enough money to get an apartment... and we're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay, Milk.<eos> As long as we don't say nothing. And I never will.<eos> I never will.
And I like you, and I'm sorry I'm gonna have to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> But if you were standing where I am... and your wife or any one of your kids had a gun... to his or her head, this time, you did have time to think, could anyone on Earth stop you from jumping?<eos> I'm begging you. Please don't do this.<eos> Here's what I want you to do.<eos> Gavin, please don't do this.<eos> I never told Shana I loved her.<eos> - You tell her for me.<eos> - I will not do it.<eos> Yes, you will.
Including Winter?<eos> Clay...<eos> The plain truth is no one wants an animal with her disability.<eos> No dolphin has ever been known to lose its entire tail and survive.<eos> Every aquarium in the country says it's hopeless.<eos> Well, they haven't met Winter.<eos> Listen, Dr. McCarthy is looking into some new materials, right?<eos> He says he can have a new tail ready by...<eos> What if she rejects that one too?<eos> She won't.
I'm a... I'm a bit off today, aren't I, Karen?<eos> So, um, vodka?<eos> I could do slow comfortable screws.<eos> Plenty of tequila.<eos> I think I'm out of lime.<eos> Um, definitely gin fizz.<eos> Just a couple of Cokes, Mom. - And some beers.<eos> - Beers. Great, Sheila. Thanks.<eos> So what if your dad comes back and sees me here?<eos> He won't.
Do you like the apartment?<eos> - Absolutly.<eos> Haven't you been awake?<eos> - I slept badly, I just woke up.<eos> You remember the importance of routines?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He sleeps here.<eos> As the court has determined, he doesn't know where you live.<eos> If you want a phone...<eos> - I will not.
He's playing some party, but this is Times Square.<eos> She's a little on edge today.<eos> Ready for the confetti test.<eos> Brendan.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I thought you were with your family.<eos> I was, then I realized you wouldn't make it through the big night without me.<eos> - Wow, I'm really touched. - Heh.<eos> I'm trying not to say this, but if I screw up...<eos> - You won't.
I need you, man!<eos> You gotta help me!<eos> Shut up, man!<eos> Shut up!<eos> This isn't going to be easy, man.<eos> Here's what you've got to do.<eos> You gotta touch her again...<eos> No, man.<eos> No way!<eos> I won't!
You want your binky?<eos> Your bottle?<eos> Tell me what you want, and I will get it for you.<eos> Stop. Don't do it.<eos> Give him what you want him to have.<eos> It's too late for me, but you're just starting out.<eos> It's not too late for you.<eos> Tell your friends.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> She won't.
Sorry you're missing it.<eos> There's nothing more romantic than municipal nuptials.<eos> I'll send you pictures of the new place.<eos> I can't believe I'm doing this without you.<eos> I don't know how you did anything with me.<eos> I love you. I love you.<eos> Kate, water 15th, power 20th. I know.<eos> I got it.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother.<eos> I will.
I order crab tortellini.<eos> Catastrophically allergic to crab.<eos> Why do I order it?<eos> Because I'm thinking of you.<eos> I have had thoughts.<eos> I want to do a paper on this -- on you.<eos> Nothing flashy -- just a dry academic one.<eos> But I think we can help some people.<eos> How would a paper help anyone?<eos> Probably won't.
Well, hooking up with loony tunes like you has left me a little suspicious.<eos> Tide's shifting now, so...<eos> What is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some kind of a telescope.<eos> It belongs to a client.<eos> Well, I got to shove off, so sayonara, which is Chinese for "Get lost."<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> Walter, you're cute, but if today works out, you'll never see me again.<eos> Nobody will.
Ellie's not in the hedge where she hides from the nanny.<eos> Ellie hides a lot.<eos> Hey, andy.<eos> I gotta go talk to him.<eos> No! You' m my searching partner/ tell-me-ellie's-crazy buddy.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're trying to find someone to tell you that I'm crazy.<eos> When I find you, you're dead.<eos> You'll never find me.<eos> No one will.
Some men will hear this and agree with it but have no resolve to live it out.<eos> Instead, they will live for themselves and waste the opportunity to leave a godly legacy for the next generation.<eos> But there are some men who, regardless of the mistakes we've made in the past, regardless of what our fathers did not do for us, will give the strength of our arms and the rest of our days to loving God with all that we are<eos> and to teach our children to do the same, and, whenever possible, to love and mentor others who have no father in their lives but who desperately need help and direction.<eos> We are inviting any man whose heart is willing and courageous to join us in this resolution.<eos> In my home, the decision has already been made.<eos> You don't have to ask who will guide my family, because by God's grace, I will.<eos> You don't have to ask who will teach my son to follow Christ, because I will.<eos> Who will accept the responsibility of providing and protecting my family?<eos> I will.

- There has to be another way.<eos> - There isn't.<eos> And you're going to die, Elena.<eos> And then I'll come back to life.<eos> That is not a risk I'm willing to take.<eos> But I am.<eos> It's my life, Damon.<eos> My choice.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
But if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.<eos> Klaus wanted to deliver a message.<eos> Sacrifice happens tonight.<eos> The ritual is straightforward.<eos> A witch will channel the power of the full moon to release the spell bound within the stone.<eos> After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire will sacrifice one of each.<eos> - Where do I fit?<eos> Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger to your death.<eos> - I can't lose you.<eos> - You won't.
It's not ok.<eos> It's not ok.<eos> All those years, I've blamed Stefan.<eos> No one forced me to love her.<eos> It was my own choice.<eos> Shh.<eos> I made the wrong choice.<eos> You tell Stefan I'm sorry.<eos> Ok?<eos> I will.
But he is deeply concerned about the ability of the family to move forward, if that's what you're asking.<eos> And if he asks what you said, I would assume I could I tell him you share the same concern.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Honey, tell me you didn't walk home.<eos> - You know the rules.<eos> - It's only six blocks.<eos> Six blocks of opportunity for some crazy l.D.S. Nut to make good on that fatwa against us.<eos> Your mother's right, sweetheart.<eos> You should have called.<eos> Okay, well, I will next time.
"Yes," "no," or "I can't recall."<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> - She's never gonna be able to do this, Bill.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Keep rehearsing.<eos> What if it gets technical?<eos> Like, what if they ask me the difference between procuring and soliciting and befriending?<eos> They won't.
How unfair life can be.<eos> It's so delicate, so precious, and then, suddenly, it's all over in an instant.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> Please, just tell me what you want!<eos> I want you to suffer... every moment of every single day for the rest of your life, just like I do.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise you, Mr. Forte.<eos> You will.
I'm doing some whites.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That makes me nervous, but, yeah, actually I do, if you're going to do some laundry.<eos> I have a big pile of dirty, smelly laundry.<eos> Just go ahead and scoop it up with your hands... I don't want to do that. ...and then wash it.<eos> I don't really want to do any laundry.<eos> I'm just coming in here so you'll play me a song.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I won't.
See, we can see how it's actually gonna be on the night of the show.<eos> It hurts my eyes.<eos> Listen, the spotlight's really cool 'cause it lets us see your big moment.<eos> Yeah, super cool.<eos> - You look awesome.<eos> - Mm-hmm. I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> Buddy, you don't have to be scared of anything.<eos> You're doing great, and you just... yeah, you keep on truckin'.<eos> Could somebody else do it?<eos> I will.
But he also worships airport security workers.<eos> Go right on through, sir.<eos> I don't notice anything, because I don't take my job seriously.<eos> Hey, why don't you invite Fatty Patty over for dinner?<eos> She's probably lonely.<eos> And I know she likes dinner.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> I will invite her to dinner.<eos> Of course you will.
Raylan have any idea?<eos> No.<eos> And he ain't gonna.<eos> When Raylan finds Dickie, that doglegged son of a bitch is gonna be dead.<eos> Aah! God!<eos> Christ, Dickie!<eos> How the hell am I gonna explain this to Genny?<eos> Just say we were out hunting and I accidentally shot you.<eos> She ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Sure she will.
Can't let you hurt a prisoner.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't happen again. He's gonna be all right.<eos> As long as he does what's right!<eos> Now, let me talk to you in a language I think you can understand.<eos> Think of this as a business deal.<eos> If I take down Dickie, you and Boyd can have free rein over all of Harlan county.<eos> Don't matter what I do.<eos> Mags won't give Dickie up.<eos> Yes, she will.
I COULD SEE MYSELF LIVING HAPPILY HERE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.<eos> AND YOU WILL.<eos> YEAH, BUT I NEED TO KNOW--<eos> IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT I'M GONNA GET KICKED OUT?<eos> I MEAN, IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE?<eos> LISTEN, DANNY, I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL, AND YOU DON'T KNOW ME THAT WELL.<eos> BUT I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF GIVING A CLIENT FALSE HOPE.<eos> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M ALREADY PAINTING THE PLACE.<eos> SO I NEED TO KNOW THAT NO ONE IS GONNA COME HERE AND KICK ME OUT--NO ONE.<eos> AND NO ONE WILL. NO ONE?
I think I'd understand if you did, though.<eos> You know, run away.<eos> You know what I don't need, Ian?<eos> I don't need your understanding.<eos> Well, we're family.<eos> We should act like one.<eos> Family protects itself.<eos> I thought you had to protect Melissa and your bundle of joy.<eos> I do...<eos> And I will.
- Hear us. - Hear us.<eos> - Grant us freedom. - Grant us freedom.<eos> - Break down these walls. - Break down these walls.<eos> - Release us. - Release us.<eos> - Goddess. - Goddess.<eos> I told her I had a brother named Jason.<eos> I lied my ass of.<eos> You know what you should do?<eos> You should go tell her right now.<eos> No, I will.
- Excuse me?<eos> - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...<eos> - You think I don't know?<eos> Staying at home was wrong?<eos> Come down here and tell me that?<eos> Let me tell you something, ghost lady.<eos> It's the living you wanna watch out for.<eos> Not the dead.<eos> There she is. Now try to forget all about it.<eos> The headmaster will.
- She sure does.<eos> She'll be going out live, nationwide, from the NBC studio in Hollywood.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> She called you?<eos> She called me up, and told me the good news!<eos> And she'll call you up, too.<eos> Of course she will.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She won't call me.<eos> Sure she will.
Come on, we both know how much time you put into this deal.<eos> - Don't blow it now.<eos> - What time?<eos> - 3:30.<eos> - Okay, fine fine.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> You can also let him know that he'd better be serious about that promotion.<eos> - You can tell him yourself tomorrow.<eos> - I will.
How do you know this?<eos> Because one of the crewmen survived.<eos> He was my father.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> The crew rigged the interior with explosives to prevent enemy access.<eos> I need someone who can open it without setting the charges off.<eos> Luckily, I already know the best.<eos> That's why you're here, Neal.<eos> - And if I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
Arthur, make me your champion.<eos> Make me your champion, and I will find Lot and avenge the death of your mother.<eos> For our family and country.<eos> It's Merlin!<eos> With the sword!<eos> Today, we pledge our allegiance to the King of all Britons;<eos> the one who removed the sword of the gods.<eos> I present to you, your undoubted King.<eos> Will you solemnly swear to rule the peoples of this realm according to their laws and customs and cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?<eos> I will.

I can't be bloody Romeo all the time!<eos> Come on, you two.<eos> Let's go inside and have a drink.<eos> Have you got a shilling? - What?<eos> - Have you got a shilling?<eos> For the gas meter.<eos> In case I'm late for supper.<eos> Freddie, darling.<eos> Would you come home with me, please?<eos> No, I will not.
Impossible.<eos> I have been here for more years than I care to remember.<eos> I am a jedi.<eos> We don't give up easily.<eos> Jedi? Huh.<eos> But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
We're adjourned.<eos> W-What...<eos> What does it mean?<eos> No jail.<eos> It means no jail.<eos> Really?<eos> You can't mess this up, Malcolm.<eos> He's giving you another chance.<eos> You need to make this work.<eos> I will.

The only question is how are we gonna get him here?<eos> The answer is by force.<eos> Ms. Cartwright. Could I talk to you about yesterday?<eos> I wanted to address the rumors about how I got into cru law.<eos> How you got in is irrelevant.<eos> You're here now. Do your best.<eos> Yes, but I need you to know that I got in on merit.<eos> And I need to know that the false things other students say about me<eos> - won't affect the way that you judge me.<eos> - It won't.
Case is a slam dunk.<eos> Eyewitness ID.<eos> Credit card receipts, cell phone records put him in the area at the right time.<eos> Final arguments are today.<eos> And you got a problem?<eos> I do.<eos> Why do you have a problem?<eos> Coply intuition.<eos> If I set it up, will you talk to him?<eos> I will.
Take Jay out of town for a couple of days.<eos> Everything cash.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Feels like I've been away too long already.<eos> He's just trying to steady the boat.<eos> And we don't need you jumping all over it.<eos> We'll have to see what Glickman says about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Harvey's dead.<eos> Who did it?<eos> HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Where's Glickman?<eos> He'll be here.<eos> He should be here already.<eos> It's him I should be talking to.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> I'm due to make a large purchase off you people.<eos> I know.<eos> And you will.
Mistake?<eos> It cost my son his life.<eos> Your son was killed instantly, Mr Delaney.<eos> No amount of backup would've saved him.<eos> But you also lost a killer.<eos> He got away!<eos> And no-one even knows what he looks like!<eos> We'll find him.<eos> How?<eos> We will.
Because...<eos> Because... we are your weakness.<eos> Yes.<eos> Is he trying to blackmail you?<eos> No.<eos> Threaten us?<eos> Call her!<eos> Tell her!<eos> Tell everyone!<eos> I will.
Harvey Wratten had me set up a brand-new line.<eos> Completely clean.<eos> He had me invest everything I own to make it look that way.<eos> Everything.<eos> But now Harvey's dead.<eos> And the only way you can make back your money is to allow me to make back mine.<eos> And the only way we can do that is if we set up that line together.<eos> So, come after me, you'll get nothing.<eos> Work with me and you'll make far more than a million.<eos> We both will.
In the end, I'd stopped hoping at all.<eos> I hadn't.<eos> And when you got shot, when they said you wouldn't pull through, I didn't then either.<eos> - And here you are.<eos> - With a bullet in my head.<eos> Which didn't kill you.<eos> - Which still might.<eos> - Hasn't yet.<eos> But is that what you're afraid of?<eos> That it will?
But when he does, whoever he calls will be calling me.<eos> Because you scared the shit out of them.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you'd like to send them a nice little bouquet when all this is worked out.<eos> It's not Stanley knives keeps people loyal, Jay.<eos> It's them putting that in there and us giving them the means to do it.<eos> Yeah, well. Let's just see who they call, shall we?<eos> All this just to find Andy Dixon?<eos> - He was there.<eos> - What if he's got nothing to say?<eos> Oh, he will.
It's Arthur!<eos> - Ready?<eos> Is this it?<eos> Have I done it?<eos> - Yes, my child.<eos> - This was everything.<eos> - I know.<eos> Now take your throne, my queen.<eos> Will you swear to rule this realm according to the laws and customs of its people, and to administer justice with mercy?<eos> - I will.

There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.<eos> You must blaze tonight, child.<eos> It's all yours to take.<eos> So blaze.<eos> What they do to the women...<eos> Do you think it happens in other villages?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Wherever it is we have to stop it.<eos> - We will.
/tis Dr. Lawson.<eos> Listen, I wanted to say that I assumed the worst about you. But Hannah talked to me.<eos> She told me how you treated her with respect, how much you careaﬂ and I think you should call her.<eos> Listen, I'm not say/ng that I think you have to call her. But I just think that you should.<eos> I'm not trying to PW<eos> I just want to know what your intentions are about my daughter.<eos> I love her.<eos> You need to call her. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I definitely will. Thanks.
Even Yogi is back with Maya.<eos> It would be nice if I could also... I mean, I'll go and do something.<eos> With those fake tears?<eos> Can you tell?<eos> Yes. I could never cry.<eos> Well, whatever you say, be sincere. My mind doesn't seem to be working.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Ifshe comes back, will the property be mine again?<eos> Can't you keep the property out of this? Fine, now will she come back?<eos> Yes, she will.
There's plenty of other targets.<eos> And I swear to you, what I am gonna do will make your little massacre look like a fucking paper cut.<eos> How messed about are we, huh, are vampires as a species, that my story can be seen as inspirational?<eos> It has to end.<eos> This story... has to die.<eos> And it's gonna hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell... tell people that you liked me.<eos> I will.
Come on.<eos> I thought the whole point of exploring unexplored sections of the ship was to, well, explore them.<eos> We are.<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, what can I say?<eos> Rush wants us to take a cautious approach.<eos> Who cares what Rush thinks?<eos> He's not our boss.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> I will.
He wants to see this work.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> This is great.<eos> You know what, though?<eos> This time, Marcus, you need to talk to people.<eos> You need to tell them about your problems and your "kurludges" and the little bugs and all the problems.<eos> They want the same thing as you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Marcus.<eos> I will.
Some people say what they mean, but don't mean what they say-- lawyers, politicians, the guy at the car wash that keeps asking me if I want to upgrade to executive.<eos> I don't need that.<eos> I prefer to say what I mean, mean what I say.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I honestly don't.<eos> Oh, oh, oh! I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's nice and wet.<eos> I can- oh, oh, oh. - No, no, no!<eos> I'll just--I'll just, uh- no, no, no.
Every day I waited for him to come and rescue me, and he never did.<eos> Who, Danny?<eos> So this is all about your brother?<eos> He's not my brother.<eos> Not any more.<eos> So this has nothing to do with the anomalies?<eos> This is just because you wanted to punish Danny? Why are you so interested in me?<eos> I thought you were somebody else, but I was wrong.<eos> That should hold him until you figure out what's going on and we can send him back home for good. If I figure out what's going on.<eos> You will.
I can't relate to you telling me you're planning to commit suicide.<eos> Is that what you're saying?<eos> What do you think it'll do to your parents?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They'd assume it's an OD.<eos> Happens all the time.<eos> You've had these thoughts before.<eos> They've always passed.<eos> It's hell while it lasts, but... It'll get better. Everything will be fine.<eos> Except it won't.
Don't you all have owl-like night vision?<eos> Oh, it's just me.<eos> Bummer.<eos> They're testing our group dynamics.<eos> On Titan, a power outage could cause life-support failure.<eos> First and foremost, we need to look after each other.<eos> Let's get this panel off and look for the electrical short.<eos> You're not the dictator of GD anymore, Number Two.<eos> No one's going to follow you down here.<eos> I will.
Uh, I'll call you if I hear anything. - OK? - OK.<eos> You know the first thing he said to me?<eos> - Where did I get this idea?<eos> I hope he told him he got the idea from you.<eos> Well, I mean, you know, we really, he and I really developed it together.<eos> It's changed a lot since the version that I started with.<eos> It's not right.<eos> You should be at the lunch.<eos> - Harcourt should know you. - He will.<eos> He will.
- Are you serious?<eos> - I'm damn serious.<eos> Maybe this is kind of a sign.<eos> Time to get out.<eos> I've put away a little money.<eos> Maybe I should just retire and...<eos> What is it retirees do?<eos> I can't believe I'm hearing this.<eos> Look, I won't let you just give up.<eos> - I won't.
Last week, a man tried to rape his girlfriend.<eos> The rapist is being set free so he can cooperate with police on another case.<eos> That's how our justice works.<eos> Make the right deal, and a rapist gets freedom.<eos> And consider this very proceeding.<eos> I'm before the board of bar overseers, and you actually suggested that I lie about an illness or a family tragedy, something more clever to get away with turning on my client.<eos> It's all just a big game.<eos> And you lecture me about moral integrity.<eos> Only real question before you today is, will she ever pull this again?<eos> I won't.
[Screaming] All I know is I can't control it.<eos> Not as yet, no, but--<eos> Look, doc, I have spent my adult life working with abnormals, learning to accept them, even appreciate them...<eos> Look, I can't account for myself when I'm that thing, and what if I hurt one of you?<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> [Screaming] [Henry]: I spent a lifetime more or less human.<eos> [Biggie]: You've yet to discover your gift.<eos> You only see the curse in it.<eos> The difference between you and me is you can control your power.<eos> And in time, so will you.
But I'm in love with you.<eos> All right, girls, a bit of professionalism here, please.<eos> This from the woman who kept us all waiting.<eos> Look, every virgin I've ever had has been great.<eos> Well, better than great.<eos> No bad habits, no bad reviews.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Will somebody please take Tim?<eos> If you're so keen, why don't you take him?<eos> All right, I will.
Nothing's changed.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> No, we just got wasted.<eos> Nice fucking you.<eos> Watch yourself!<eos> You don't trust me, remember?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I'll break your fingers.<eos> No, you won't.
You know how it gets on the road.<eos> You know, Dante gets tense.<eos> You're not on the road.<eos> Dante gets tense at home too.<eos> Prudence knows the deal.<eos> What, the deal?<eos> No, I'm pretty sure prudence does not know the deal.<eos> And I think--I think that you should tell her.<eos> Or what?<eos> Or I-I will.
No blinking.<eos> Hey! Hey! I was just getting ready to show michelle what I can do.<eos> What you can do?<eos> You're not even making any sense.<eos> I make sense.<eos> My zoop. Uh... Ooh, you've been drinking.<eos> Ohh. Ooh, you've been drinking a lot. Ohh.<eos> Whoa! Whoa. Okay.<eos> Okay. Okay, well, when she wakes up tomorrow with a gigantic hangover, tell her that I had a fantastic time.<eos> I sure will. Okay.
Excuse me, Sam.<eos> Another woman was just reported missing.<eos> Her husband said she had car trouble.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to leave.<eos> Promise me one thing.<eos> You'll give me five minutes alone with this guy.<eos> I'll do the same thing to him he did to her.<eos> That's what he deserves, not jail, and he has to pay for what he did to my mother.<eos> He will.
No sorry, it's uh-<eos> It's okay, really.<eos> Be careful on the road okay?<eos> All set?<eos> Okay. One sec sweetie-<eos> Well have fun and let me know if you need anything okay? Anything at all.<eos> I'm not going to call you while I'm gone.<eos> And I don't want you to call me either.<eos> Why does it feel like I'm never going to see you again?<eos> You will, Bo.
Highness, these so-called cardinals who attack His Holiness, are the very ones who accepted bribes to promote his election.<eos> Borgia's degradation is well documented!<eos> Jesus Christ, our Savior, was in like manner accused by the Pharisees, who were themselves corrupt.<eos> Do not be fooled, Highness, a tiara is no crown of thorns.<eos> Rodrigo shows no inclination to imitate Christ.<eos> And when have you, della Rovere?<eos> Majesty, I understand that you have recently signed a treaty with the King of England.<eos> But what will Henry VII say, what will the other Christian princes say, if word is bruited abroad that you besiege the Vicar of Christ and claim to judge him?<eos> The very man to whom God has committed the judgment of all men?<eos> What will your wife,
Because you're a lousy cop.<eos> And you love her.<eos> Because I love her.<eos> And thus, I love her feet.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, look at those feet.<eos> I just want to taste those arches.<eos> You can-- you can go right ahead.<eos> You can do that.<eos> Oh, I will.
You can't just stand there and watch her die!<eos> Bizzy. You can't...<eos> Addie, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for bizzy. I'm sorry for you.<eos> what did she want me to do?<eos> Susan had a d.N.R.<eos> Listen to me. You did the right thing.<eos> You did what susan wanted.<eos> Bizzy's never gonna forgive me.<eos> Oh, e will.
Are you in City Hall?<eos> Yes, unfortunately.<eos> Is anybody hurt?<eos> Not mortally, yet.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'd love to chat with you, Lisbon, but there's a man here with a large gun, who wants to talk to you. Who's this?<eos> Mr. Crosswhite, this is Agent Lisbon.<eos> Let's just take it easy, okay?<eos> You tell all those cops to stay out of here.<eos> I will.
I think you've found something really quite remarkable.<eos> It's an original idea, he has a unique voice<eos> - So you'll publish it?<eos> I'd publish anything if it would lure you back.<eos> But, yes.<eos> He'll be thrilled.<eos> You don't know what it'll mean to him.<eos> I still want to know more about him.<eos> Have you found out anything?<eos> No, but I will. Good.
Um, I know I shouldn't be here, but...<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We can't give you that information.<eos> You're not Corey's wife.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> He needs surgery.<eos> So w-what are you waiting for?<eos> Patricia wants to manage the swelling with drugs in hopes that Corey will heal naturally and regain his full brain function.<eos> And will he?
You're gonna want to take a moment to get settled in, put 66 years of prison behind you.<eos> But we don't have a moment to waste.<eos> Some of you will be taken to the portal array's location to finish the infrastructure.<eos> Depending on your specialties, the rest will do final design work, helping us obtain the rest of what we need.<eos> We own these homes... and the land they sit on.<eos> But this is nothing. Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - I am. You understand the size of the array we're building, the amount of fuel we're going to need?<eos> - This operation needs to work.<eos> - It will.
- See what?<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about what happened this morning.<eos> You wanted to look for her.<eos> Why?<eos> This whole time I've wanted to ask you.<eos> 'Cause I think she's still out there.<eos> Truth is, what else I got to do?<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We will.
When?<eos> Is there anyone there?<eos> - I don't know. I'm on it!<eos> - Find out!<eos> I need to talk to a bomb specialist now!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll be alright.<eos> When will it explode?<eos> The man said it'll explode if ..<eos> It won't!
We got his address, though.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Just need to see your ID, sir. Okay, okay.<eos> Okay. First Class.<eos> Mr. Fargas.<eos> First door on your left.<eos> Okay. Here's your ID.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice flight.<eos> I will.
You could be one of my daughter's boyfriends.<eos> Which makes me the matronly mom.<eos> This is criminal.<eos> I used to be younger than you.<eos> You're still beautiful.<eos> Take this.<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> No, no, it's OK.<eos> - I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> - You won't.
Come on. Hey, stop. Will you stop running into traffic?<eos> My gosh. You made me spill my beer.<eos> You're gonna get hit by another truck.<eos> Let me tell you something, that truck knocked the life into me.<eos> Does Marsha feel that way?<eos> About what?<eos> About... About the new you.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, you need to talk to her.<eos> - I will.
Bob!<eos> Your mother told you to go, so go!<eos> Out.<eos> Go on, guys. I'll catch up.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I don't care what the fucking DNA test says.<eos> You're not taking Liam.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Forward.<eos> You see, it is working.<eos> Now where do I go to find Pippa?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Anybody got a 20 on this nut job?<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> Take off the hood.<eos> It's working, Mr. Lusek!<eos> The world must see that I have cured you. Now, take off your hood.<eos> And they will.
Dr. Bailey, when you're rolling down the far side of the hill, things fall apart.<eos> Uh... Okay, look, if it was me, and my wife was suddenly accident prone and losing track of details, I wouldn't ask the general surgeon who's only been an attending for a year to check her out.<eos> I'd ask the neuro guy... the very fancy, extremely good neurosurgeon who happens to be studying neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's, who happens to be a close friend.<eos> That's who I'd ask.<eos> But that's just me.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you were all right.<eos> Ricky's not, that's for sure.<eos> I told Julia that she'd find somebody else.<eos> - But... I'm not sure I believed it.<eos> - She will.
For the procedure to work, we would need to transplant two.<eos> But... But I only have two.<eos> That's right.<eos> The procedure would kill you.<eos> Ha ha, that car's gettin' towed!<eos> My God, Dr. Hartman, isn't there any other way?<eos> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Griffin.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> What?<eos> I'll...
I had to work the fields.<eos> You're such a pig!<eos> Whoa! I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but you're kind of making me feel bad.<eos> Well, you should feel bad.<eos> You're cheating on my mother.<eos> What? ! Mm-hmm.<eos> I never cheated on you.<eos> Then why you showing up here with your tail tucked between your legs?<eos> I came to tell you I don't have a high school diploma.<eos> And now, thanks to lumpy, the study partner, I never will.
Look, there's no signal.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> I was going to yesterday but..<eos> OK, the doctor's here with me now.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> I didn't forget, dearest.<eos> Would I?<eos> What way is that to talk?<eos> OK, first thing tomorrow I'll..
The stealing of carrots, the unpaid bill of fare.<eos> Rodrigo sees you as uniquely qualified to make decisions in his name.<eos> A large step and good training.<eos> Listening to the desires of others is the key to learning their weaknesses.<eos> Like Lucrezia.<eos> That sad, conflicted girl.<eos> Sad?<eos> May we all be as satisfied.<eos> His Holiness will not allow her to remain in the convent of San Sisto because he wants to secure her.<eos> Yes, he will.
I think maybe part of that is leading by example.<eos> - I think I'm a great example. - Mm-hm...<eos> Maybe I could tone it down a little.<eos> But I can't promise it won't happen again.<eos> I've had my share of psycho sorority sister moments in my day, putting you through hell most of your pledging.<eos> So enjoy this place while you're here, because one day you're gonna go off into the big bad world, and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
Um... the excellent horse moves before the whip touches its back.<eos> The good horse runs at the lightest touch.<eos> The poor horse doesn't move until he feels pain.<eos> And then there's the very bad horse.<eos> He doesn't move until the whip penetrates his marrow.<eos> My car accident... was my whip.<eos> It broke me.<eos> And it... brought me back to Lacey.<eos> What if I screw up again?<eos> You won't.

Just now when you were late, I was worried sick.<eos> Why are you interfering?<eos> I didn't come here to fight.<eos> Oh, God, why can't I make her understand?<eos> Didn't you say it was my fault, that I introduced her, that if I hadn't left, none of this would've happened?<eos> So let me fix it, then.<eos> If I pay, it means I have accepted it was my fault.<eos> But he has consented.<eos> He won't let us be.<eos> - He won't, anyway.
To beat him like a common pimp?<eos> If that is what he is, Father-<eos> If that is what he is, then what does that make you?<eos> You've heard the rumour.<eos> That one of us was sired by him, and not by you, not by the Pope of Rome?<eos> And you want to feed these rumours?<eos> What is all of Rome talking about now?<eos> Hmm? - I will not have him in her house!<eos> - You will-<eos> You will not?
But then it grew sweeter.<eos> I need details.<eos> You will not have them.<eos> Your husband, Giovanni...<eos> He... fell off his horse.<eos> Foolish man.<eos> He will go hunting.<eos> I find the more confined husbands become the more... tolerable.<eos> I could write a book about it.<eos> Perhaps I will.
You're not the only one who's trained in psy-ops, you know.<eos> You've been hiding something from us all week and you've been highly emotional.<eos> For your information, I'm emotional because<eos> I got dumped last week by my boyfriend for being... too emotional!<eos> Look, I don't do too well with girls and crying.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Maybe we should be a little easier on her.<eos> She's trained to do this, Chuck.<eos> Do not let her manipulate you.<eos> Okay, fine, I won't, I won't.
This is DS Gray, SSU, requesting urgent armed response to Egmont Terrace, E1.<eos> And send an ambulance.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> DS Gray DS Ripley, please escort Miss Calvert home.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm angry.<eos> Too angry?<eos> Just angry enough.<eos> Because I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John.<eos> They won't, Martin.
Pick up the phone! Pick up the phone!<eos> I am here!<eos> I am...<eos> No. That man, that voice, those voices, that's the man we're gonna leave on the streets if we do not do our jobs properly.<eos> This isn't about DS Ripley<eos> It's about Sadie. It's about Abby. It's about Jason.<eos> It's about all the others that will be next if we mess this up.<eos> Listen, DS Ripley knows that and he wouldn't have it any other way, so if you respect him at all... just get back to work.<eos> What if Pell regards your silence as weakness rather than strength?<eos> He won't.
What random and not-helpful fact, Phil.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm... I'm having kind of a rough day.<eos> Yeah, I'm kind of having a rough day myself.<eos> Look, Phil, I need you to take care of dinner for me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out.<eos> Don't do that. Just explain to her what happened.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.<eos> - Sure, she will.
Yeah.<eos> The police said I did.<eos> What do you say?<eos> We... we went in a motor.<eos> A van.<eos> Who was driving the van?<eos> I can't say.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of now.<eos> He said he'd hurt my mum if I told.<eos> He won't.
Then she dropped out, and it was rewritten as a buddy comedy with Dempsey and Josh Hartnett.<eos> But everyone fell asleep during the table read, so we moved it over to Telemundo where they tried to turn it into a variety show hosted by a supermodel and a soccer ball with a mustache.<eos> I met that soccer ball once at a no-hands-allowed sex party.<eos> Then after another round of rewrites, it was picked up by our low-budget thriller, high-budget porno division, Splatterflix, and now it's a horror movie starring "any blonde actress."<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait, that's our project?<eos> This is exactly what I was talking to Lemon about.<eos> Three years, millions on rewrites, $20,000 in first-class flights for the drill.<eos> And we still have nothing to show for it.<eos> And we never will.
He said it hadn't happened since, but what if he's wrong?<eos> What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?<eos> His EEG didn't show any sign of seizure activity.<eos> I didn't say it was a seizure, I said it was something like a seizure.<eos> I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an EEG to prove...<eos> Nope.<eos> Because I already got one.<eos> You want me to sing?<eos> How's singing My Bonnie going to help you see inside my brain?<eos> It won't.
Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I've never--I've never punched a girl before.<eos> - That's comforting.<eos> - I feel like she had it coming, though.<eos> You know...<eos> She was turning into a wolf and everything.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> Do either of you wanna switch for a little bit?<eos> Sure, yeah. I will.
[Laughing] - Thank you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Love you too. Bye.<eos> Love you. [Giggles]<eos> - See ya.<eos> - Bye, I'll see you later.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Young man...<eos> - Okay. - Enjoy yourself.<eos> - I will, I will.
So to get these freebie socialist tax credits we are going to make this place lean and green.<eos> Typical corporate bullshit. Thirty acres of wetlands disappear every single day but all you care about is how much gas you pump out.<eos> Hey, we're just supplying a demand.<eos> Yeah, AmPetCo's demand for huge profits.<eos> Well, some of those huge profits are paying ISIS to protect that pipeline.<eos> Which I'm only doing for the wetlands.<eos> Wetlands, profits, whatever.<eos> Yeah, sounds like a win-win.<eos> Just get out there and do your job.<eos> Yeah, I will.
The shape of the complex is roughly the same as the mother ships.<eos> If I'm right...<eos> They're building landing sites.<eos> Yeah, but for what?<eos> For their invasion.<eos> There are 538 Concordia sites being built around the world.<eos> - But there are only 29 mother ships.<eos> - Yeah, do the math. More on the way.<eos> - If those ships land...<eos> - They won't.
deposit the rent every month!<eos> I have all the receipts.<eos> Look.<eos> What happened?<eos> They've given us a notice of seven days but have served it today... which is the last day.<eos> But how can anyone just snatch my land from me?<eos> The government wants to sell this stable and build a warehouse here.<eos> But we all know who is using this excuse... to demolish our stable school... and why.<eos> But this time we won't let it happen!<eos> We definitely won't, guruji.
Military training in service of terrorist ops.<eos> Not the friendliest children in the schoolyard, in other words.<eos> Question is, what is he doing here?<eos> I don't know, but it's a hell of a wrinkle this close to go time.<eos> Hq. Flag on the play.<eos> What type of flag are we talking about?<eos> Dratschev received a shipment of nukes here tonight.<eos> Three guesses who the customer is.<eos> If the iranians get their hands on those missiles...<eos> They won't.
We finished the 9-Liner,<eos> The boy is good, the girl is stabilized. Isn't it Fitz's turn?<eos> Rebecca, you're gonna lead in Fitz's surgery.<eos> I'm gonna scrub in to observe. I want to be there for him.<eos> Sir, the mother from the 9-Liner,<eos> She is fighting to live, And we have a chance to save her if we can get to her right now. We're doing Fitz first.<eos> Look, I understand your feelings, Sir.<eos> I do. But we prioritize patients based on Their best chance of survival, not--<eos> Then this time, we make an exception!<eos> Sir, respectfully, we will not.
My mother wouldn't let them, but now I wish they had.<eos> I've asked the others and they say you're the one to help me.<eos> Of course I will. I'd be happy to.<eos> That's what they said. If you can just find a way to tell her?<eos> We'll both find a way.<eos> Mr Carson, might I have a word?<eos> I'm busy with this dinner for tomorrow night.<eos> Well, that's just it.<eos> I don't expect you'll be using Mr Lang.<eos> Not after last time. - I will not.
You don't sound very excited.<eos> To quote you 'that's not who we are. '<eos> There's something I've been meaning to ask you. Here's the hero.<eos> Why did you try to bribe Anna?<eos> She told you, did she? She didn't.<eos> Not me.<eos> But why did you do it?<eos> Next time, if you want to know anything, just ask me.<eos> Well done. Very well done.<eos> All right then I will.
Unmarried?<eos> I'll live with his mother while the banns are read.<eos> And then we'll be married.<eos> And I'll get a job as a nurse.<eos> What does your mother make of this?<eos> If you must know, she thinks we're very foolish.<eos> So, at least we have something in common. I won't allow it!<eos> I will not allow my daughter to throw away her life!<eos> You can posture all you like, Papa, it won't make any difference.<eos> Yes, it will!
Okay. I'll do this.<eos> But here's how it's gonna go.<eos> See that guy behind you?<eos> Don't look now, dumbass.<eos> I'll help you hook up with her if you help me with him.<eos> He looks like a douche.<eos> Fine, forget it.<eos> All right, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, of course I'll help you.<eos> I will, okay?
I can't just sit here, Bobby.<eos> I've got to help him.<eos> Dean.<eos> You know, "Dreamscape" his noggin... something.<eos> You know what Cass did.<eos> The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.<eos> - We don't know what's going on inside.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - We have got to do something!<eos> - And we will.
Let the tournament begin.<eos> So, these red flakes, they were embedded in the front of his skull.<eos> He's so ground up, it'll be tough to determine the cause of death.<eos> At least he was already dead before he was pulled apart.<eos> You know, the only perimortem injury that I could find is this fracture to the nasal bone. - Who dies of a broken nose?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> If I can't figure out the cause of death Dr. Brennan's going to be tossing me into that machine.<eos> Right.<eos> You're supposed to say, "No, she'll understand."<eos> Oh, but she won't.
So, did I pass?<eos> It's not that kind of test.<eos> The questionnaire is step one.<eos> There's so much more to cover before I can make a recommendation about surgery.<eos> Great. So, what's step two?<eos> Well, generally we recommend further counseling before starting hormone therapy.<eos> I don't need counseling!<eos> Honey, we just want to make sure.<eos> What if you change your mind?<eos> I won't!
It's a classic illustration of why people try to screw each other over when it's in their best interests to cooperate.<eos> It's game theory.<eos> You think Shea's going to run, you run first.<eos> What if Shea doesn't run?<eos> This isn't a game.<eos> Okay, I am not going back to maximum security.<eos> I cannot talk to my daughter through three inches of plexiglas.<eos> Erica, I don't want to go back there, either, believe me.<eos> But I don't want to ruin the best work release program we could find.<eos> I won't.
I think this is a very responsible thing to do.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, you can go now.<eos> You don't want me to wait for you?<eos> Because we could go and grab some dinner, just the two of us, and then maybe you could stay over tonight just for old time's sake.<eos> No.<eos> I'll be fine, Mom.<eos> All right.<eos> If you change your mind, you--<eos> I won't.
He did it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay, Puck?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, I'm really sorry I wasn't around, you know?<eos> To see you get naked in court.<eos> Another time.<eos> Take care.<eos> I will.
Right, it was shit.<eos> Jai, you could've ignored them.<eos> Sometimes I just don't understand what gets into you guys.<eos> A small thing and you lose all control.<eos> A small thing?<eos> It's not a small thing, Naina.<eos> And people who treat this as a small thing... should be slapped right and left!<eos> Because they are responsible for encouraging such behaviour.<eos> You think you'll change everyone, Jai?<eos> Yes, Naina, I will.
See, that's the thing.<eos> From the beginning, my heart has always wanted...<eos> Don't...<eos> Erica...<eos> No, okay? No. Just stop talking.<eos> I don't want to hear it, okay?<eos> I gotta go find Sam and uh..<eos> Shit.<eos> Y-you do not tell Sam ever.<eos> I won't. - Ever!
Hang on. Let me put on my glasses.<eos> No, I can't say I do.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Isn't that the little girl that died?<eos> Are you a reporter?<eos> No, no, nothing like that.<eos> Then why are you asking these questions?<eos> I just...need to find them.<eos> If you know anything important about this little girl and her mum, you should go to the police.<eos> I will. Maybe I will.
I'm sure he's okay.<eos> If Travis is there, we've gotta catch him before he does God knows what to how many people.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It's me.<eos> I made it.<eos> - Are you in Homicide yet?<eos> - I'm on my way right now.<eos> Remember, it's lieutenant Morgan that is leading this attack against us.<eos> You must get to her.<eos> - I will.
I love you, but I wasn't talking to you.<eos> I mean, he was lucky.<eos> The exposure was very mild, but this gas attacks the upper respiratory tract.<eos> You could get nosebleeds followed by extreme dizziness, especially after physical exertion.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Got it.<eos> - You gonna go to the E.R.?<eos> - On my honor.<eos> Stop with the sarcastic bullshit, all right?<eos> No bullshit, I will. Really.
I am the beginning and the end.<eos> I am making everything new.<eos> No!<eos> Stop! - What?<eos> - Get away from him!<eos> I killed you.<eos> Stay back!<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> How's the world going to end if the beast is still alive?<eos> It won't.
This is what you wanted all along tonight.<eos> Now you don't wanna get married.<eos> You wanna live together.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I mean, if you don't wanna get married now, you're probably never gonna wanna get married.<eos> I'm fine with that.<eos> I just wanna be with you.<eos> Yeah, well, no matter what we want,<eos> I don't think your parents would ever let us live together.<eos> No. They will.
I'd say he's harmless. Darren, it's not harmless.<eos> It's totally freaking me out.<eos> I'm saying I don't think he means any harm.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> And what, he'll deny it?<eos> Maybe but if I tell him he's freaking you out he'll stop.<eos> I know he will.<eos> Talk to him then.<eos> Yeah, I will.
We double up the dose, she'll be fine.<eos> We bring her to the hospital, we do a CT scan to locate the bleed, drill a burr hole in her skull, and maybe she'll be fine.<eos> We can drill a burr hole here.<eos> You're not just risking our careers here.<eos> You could go back to prison.<eos> I made a promise.<eos> You made a promise?<eos> I will not take her to the hospital.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I will.
Come on. You guys are my best friends.<eos> It's really so sweet of you to feel that way, Ben.<eos> But you have a new best friend.<eos> Adrian. Come on.<eos> You two will always be my best friends.<eos> Adrian is just--<eos> The mother of your baby and your soon-to-be wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, guys, that's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
You're starting to stress me out.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't wanna stress you out, but...<eos> Are you sure you don't wanna change your mind?<eos> It's not too late, you know.<eos> You can even wait until the baby is older.<eos> Like when the baby is 16?<eos> Look, I haven't changed my mind, and I'm not going to change my mind.<eos> But if you do--<eos> I won't.
Go to sleep, it's late.<eos> Will you tell?<eos> You are not a child!<eos> Anyways tell me.<eos> Once during a fight two pilots saw storks, "leleky", coming back home, and they had a front line ahead.<eos> Explosion, smoke, fire...<eos> And then our father and uncle Kolya decided to escort them...<eos> Will father come back?<eos> Yes.<eos> When will all the birds.
Unknown.<eos> She was found killed.<eos> They didn't take anything. The Gold Star of the Hero wasn't taken.<eos> That's the way we play ball in the ball park - l am alone, and Vanya is alone.<eos> We will act through Red Cross, meanwhile I am completing the formalities about adopting.<eos> Vanya is adult now, he understands everything.<eos> Uncle Kolya? Can you bring papa from Canada on your plain?<eos> Not by MiG.We need an other plain for this.<eos> You will have to wait, Ivan.<eos> I will.
You're way, way too young to be moving in with a guy. It's not just me moving in with a guy, it's my son, John, and me moving in with his father and my boyfriend.<eos> You guys are my best friends.<eos> But you have a new best friend.<eos> Adrian. That's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
Eton College?<eos> My ass.<eos> So why did you give me the job?<eos> Have a guess.<eos> So you could get us thrown out at any point then?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> Better make sure you stay in my good books hadn't you?<eos> Don't pretend you won't enjoy it.<eos> What if I say no?<eos> You won't.
We loved Gloria, too.<eos> We wanna get justice, but this isn't the way to do it.<eos> You have no idea what he's done.<eos> How about trafficking underage girls?<eos> He was behind a case we just broke.<eos> 16-year-old runaway.<eos> We managed to help her, but there were others we couldn't save.<eos> We can rescue them, then take down Pajaro's entire operation, but not if you kill him.<eos> He can't hurt another girl.<eos> He won't.
What about your father?<eos> He was at the hospital that day, wasn't he?<eos> Of course.<eos> Both my parents were there.<eos> He was in trouble with the I.R.S. and about to declare bankruptcy.<eos> Perhaps he was trying to do something that would look like hospital malpractice so he could sue.<eos> That is the most idiotic thing I've ever...<eos> What?<eos> You try it!<eos> - Okay, I will.
DI Louise Munroe.<eos> Well, in that case, my dear, I am not Mr. Canning.<eos> My name is Richard Moat.<eos> Comedy Viagra.<eos> Well, I need to speak to him.<eos> He's an important witness. Do you know where he is?<eos> No.<eos> Well, when you see him, can you get him to phone me at the station?<eos> Urgently.<eos> I certainly will...
Faith?<eos> You take it where you can.<eos> This is not how I saw my life.<eos> Me neither.<eos> This was a surprise for you?<eos> Well, yes, you could say that.<eos> I always imagined him going on the golf course.<eos> Well, not that he's actually gone yet.<eos> Don't worry, Gloria.<eos> - He will soon.
Mark, put the gun down.<eos> You should listen to him, kid.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Listen to me, Mark.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> You don't have to do this, Mark.<eos> Killing him won't do anything for you or your father.<eos> He can't get away with murder!<eos> - He won't.
You should listen to him, kid.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Listen to me, Mark.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> You don't have to do this, Mark.<eos> Killing him won't do anything for you or your father.<eos> He can't get away with murder!<eos> - He won't.<eos> - Of course he will.
Yeah. Yeah, we're clear.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> - I'm sorry I left you.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Someone, uh, taking you home?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna get a ride with Traci.<eos> Andy... you can't stay at your dad's.<eos> I've been to your dad's.<eos> Fine, then I'll...
What then?<eos> More infections, more pain?<eos> Yeah, but that, that is my decision, isn't it?<eos> That's my life.<eos> Tess, I don't need you or anybody.<eos> You see, that's where you're wrong and that is what worries me.<eos> Because it's all right being independent, but what are you gonna do when you really, really need help?<eos> Ben.<eos> He'll tire of it, Caitlin.<eos> He will. No, he won't.
I'm not just arresting you for murder.<eos> I'm arresting you so your clients can get better representation.<eos> Okay, I know that killing an embezzler or even an actor should never have been plan "A,"<eos> but I never would have done any of this if it weren't for the fact that I am absolutely, totally dead broke.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
So are they allowed to kiss humans?<eos> You're shameless.<eos> Is it wrong that I have a curious mind too?<eos> Uh-huh. I don't think it's your mind that's curious.<eos> Ah!<eos> But I'm hoping he won't be here long enough for you to find out.<eos> I'm gonna make sure he gets home safe.<eos> He didn't come here to hurt anybody.<eos> I just wish they could understand that.<eos> Well, maybe Valentina will.
Takumi... We're done talking.<eos> Go away.<eos> I'll lose right at the start. I promise.<eos> I won't. so I'll go alone.<eos> Won't you at least wait until 11:00?<eos> I won't. Takumi!<eos> Just do what everyone expects!<eos> anyway?<eos> Just give me one last chance.<eos> I won't.
You don't need those kind of signs.<eos> It's the non-verbal stuff that matters.<eos> He's crazy about you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good.<eos> Panic over, yeah?<eos> For now. Yeah.<eos> He adores me, you reckon? Yeah, he does.<eos> So you let me know how you get on with that test.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I will.
About what?<eos> Kate, I saw you.<eos> So what happened that night? When you saw that gun, you froze.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Your hand was shaking.<eos> That's not nothing.<eos> Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all. It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
Do you think that she's trying to let you down easy?<eos> Easy's not her style, no.<eos> Well, then she's trying to make you jealous.<eos> Trust me, Nate.<eos> We're all the same.<eos> Okay, so what do I do?<eos> Fight fire with fire.<eos> Take me as your date.<eos> Well, no. I wouldn't wanna-- I wouldn't wanna ruin your night.<eos> I... You won't.
Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?<eos> No, no.<eos> After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you-you asked if I had protection.<eos> Oh, you did, didn't you? Of course.<eos> I'm always packing.<eos> Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and... that was all she wrote.<eos> So, we didn't actually...<eos> I did.<eos> Penny, please, please promise me you won't tell anybody about this.<eos> Of course I won't. No, I won't.
!<eos> T.K., I'm in the middle of my son's teen pizza party.<eos> I love pepperoni.<eos> You are my patient.<eos> If I just let you waltz in here anytime of any day,<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> Okay, so, what, so this whole thing is like a lesson?<eos> I'm in distress, Doc!<eos> We will talk about this at your appointment.<eos> No. We won't.
Yes.<eos> I have some experience with revenge, Elka.<eos> It's never as satisfying as you hope, and the police always come sooner than you expect.<eos> Just think about what you're doing.<eos> And that coming from someone who hates to think about what's she's doing.<eos> Mom, what is going on with you?<eos> I'm not gonna leave till I clean up this mess.<eos> No, this is my mess.<eos> I'll clean it up.<eos> No, I will.
The mother and child-- a daughter-- escaped to America.<eos> But it didn't end there.<eos> 25 years later, the daughter came back.<eos> She had changed her name.<eos> She had two children.<eos> A girl and a boy.<eos> My father swore on his father's grave to end their bloodline.<eos> She died not far from here on a beach while her son played.<eos> He won't go easily.<eos> No, he won't.
The network won't pay him.<eos> You like this guy?<eos> -Of course not. -Then we need to make it happen.<eos> If there was something I could do, don't you think I would have done it?<eos> -l would give anything to have Dice back.<eos> -Anything?<eos> Give him a piece of your salary.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> Give him your salary.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
- Where's that?<eos> - England.<eos> It's where you make the big trip across the ocean.<eos> Did you go there, Mama?<eos> I did, dear.<eos> That's where my boat left from, when I came over from Ireland.<eos> I'm going to do that, too.<eos> Sail a big ship like Sinbad straight over the waves.<eos> Mind you don't get seasick, now.<eos> I won't.
I just need a minute.<eos> Tammy?<eos> Uncle Cy?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I--I was just going to buy some beer.<eos> You ok?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe I should take you home.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble with mom and dad.<eos> You won't.
He says it's a divine gift.<eos> There's this light, this light of the world, and it's in all of us.<eos> It connects us.<eos> Look, Doc, I know it's hard to understand that it's there, but once Jonas explains it to you, you'll see it.<eos> Everything just makes sense.<eos> This might seem all quite miraculous to you, but what you're experiencing has nothing to do with the divine.<eos> This is a result of his ability.<eos> His Alpha ability.<eos> You should let him show you.<eos> Uh...well, maybe I will, Nina.
Such a brutal attack on Tahir.. Confirms that it's someone close to Reddy<eos> In fact, he referred to Reddy as Anna..<eos> And he sounded very angry.<eos> He followed us the entire day.<eos> In fact, he even knew that we went for a film from Swati's office.<eos> I am sure his men were keeping a watch outside my house.<eos> Tonight he will definitely attack me.<eos> That's when we will know his identity.<eos> Yash, what if he doesn't show up?<eos> He will for sure.
What's behind that wall is a vacant lot.<eos> Eileen, will you accept this rose?<eos> I will.<eos> Joy.<eos> Melanie.<eos> I wish I could take you both to the final round.<eos> But there's only one rose left.<eos> Yes, we know.<eos> Would you please just tell us who it is already?<eos> I will...
You ok?<eos> Just drive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Honey, your dad...<eos> All our families, we have beliefs that have been passed on through generations.<eos> And we were taught never to stray from them.<eos> You did. You taught me to look at things in a different way.<eos> I just thought that he was the one who got me.<eos> He did.<eos> He will again.
Yeah.<eos> Well... it couldn't have been Mike.<eos> He... hasn't even left his bedroom since Thursday.<eos> I didn't go there.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I'm glad I bumped into you.<eos> I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Looks like they're friends.<eos> If those two hook up and she starts asking him about that night, and he remembers--<eos> - He won't.
That's off the table for the moment.<eos> Em, Emmy, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If you're stressing about the Danby scholarship, I want you to let it go, okay?<eos> They're not going to withdraw the offer because you had a setback.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I know that you need to rest.<eos> You need to listen to the doctor.<eos> I need to swim.<eos> Hey, you will, babe.
We have a situation on our hands.<eos> Should be home soon.<eos> Do you have Jane's phone?<eos> Pretty sure it's in the back.<eos> Look, I need you to text Cassie and tell her that Jane's home already.<eos> Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
Uh-huh?<eos> Then forget it.<eos> I'll go to the supermarket!<eos> Go.<eos> Go to the supermarket.<eos> You can't get anything the damn supermarket!<eos> Here you go.<eos> On the house.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
I don't see how that matters.<eos> Well, it indicates that you thought your husband would be a handful even before you went to pick him up that night.<eos> Kind of undercuts the whole idea that you went up on the mountain with Bob and had a spontaneous argument.<eos> All right, well, so I had a feeling he might chicken out, and he did.<eos> Look -- I actually made him sound a lot better than he was, and [chuckles] I mean, you have no idea -- none -- how jealous he was that Missy and me were on television and he wasn't.<eos> Speaking of which, how soon will this video get out to the national media?<eos> I'd say... a year and a half-ish.<eos> A year and a half?<eos> But you said people would see me.<eos> Oh, people will.
As real friends who see that she's going to try to cause trouble when she doesn't need to do that.<eos> Because we're not that good at being friends.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> Or you could be.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I knew I was in love with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> And when you're talking to Jack, remember you're in love with me.<eos> I will.
Well, I don't, dick-meat, so get the hell out of here.<eos> - I'm sorry, what'd you say?<eos> - What, are you gonna beat me up?<eos> Is that an invitation?<eos> 'Cause I'd be more than happy to go there.<eos> Go ahead, hit me.<eos> I could use the money.<eos> You talk to the police, Marcus?<eos> - Why don't you ask them.<eos> - Oh, I will, I will.
She said that a bad cop had framed her and is forcing her to help him.<eos> I told her that there was nothing to tell this man about us because we are honest businessmen.<eos> I hoped the fofficer would grow tired of waiting and leave her alone, but unfortunately, that did not happen.<eos> I'm afraid your killer may be closer to home than you think.<eos> We've already ruled out detective Carver.<eos> Of course.<eos> And what were you... honest businessmen doing between 10:00 P.M. and midnight on the night Jane was killed?<eos> We were home, watching television.<eos> Please feel free to speak to any of my household staff if you wish to verify this information.<eos> We will.
Give me something.<eos> Alex, there's not enough.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Lights.<eos> I can't remember the next step.<eos> Well, you might remember this the next time you're screaming at an intern for skipping the fundamentals.<eos> Will you just do it, please?<eos> Take your time.<eos> It'll come back.<eos> No, it won't.
I don't know, Larry.<eos> Maybe yes, maybe no.<eos> Technically?<eos> Technically, yes.<eos> Did you give Afzal Hamid a razorblade?<eos> No.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're free.<eos> I hope I never see you again.<eos> Oh, you will.
Why--why did you bring that up?<eos> I said yes.<eos> You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out.<eos> And everybody called you "the gerbil" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?<eos> Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV.<eos> The point is you can't choose where you were born.<eos> But you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
Sounds like you did just fine without me.<eos> Did you ever connect with Emily?<eos> Uh, no, I did not.<eos> After you left I went over to find out why she cancelled, and get this... she's over there with some other guy.<eos> Yeah, not the first time I've seen him hanging around, either.<eos> Mm. What a bitch.<eos> Well...<eos> If it helps, I smelled that one coming a mile away.<eos> Doesn't help.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
It's not just me you're punishing.<eos> What about your boys?<eos> Andrew, Juliet.<eos> I'm not planning on being my sister forever.<eos> Just long enough to fix things.<eos> Just give me a chance, and I...<eos> By midnight, or I'll tell andrew everything.<eos> Your call.<eos> - I won't do it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
So he used that passageway to scare off tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion's legend so that no one would want to live there.<eos> And then when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around, he had to kill him, too.<eos> You guys.<eos> Great story.<eos> The DA will never buy it.<eos> It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
Conflict of interest.<eos> Oh, oh.<eos> I'm... Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's got a couple stitches in his head.<eos> He's gonna give a statement to Internal Affairs.<eos> All right, well, you tell him that we're all thinking about him.<eos> I will.
It's still a crazy plan.<eos> We've got those traps after us, now we've got this Frank Butler after us.<eos> You know, I would say that things can't get much worse than this.<eos> I've come to collect the bank's money. The money you took.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Unless you want to see that school teacher dead.<eos> His man's got Miss Catherine, Dan.<eos> He'll kill her if we don't give him the bank's money.<eos> Did you tell him that we don't have it?<eos> But we will by the end of tomorrow.
Still.<eos> You see that, don't you.<eos> I still have to watch out, just so some other woman doesn't lure him away. Still.<eos> And all those infidelities had their advantages.<eos> There is no man more attentive than the one feeling guilty.<eos> Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that?<eos> If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But he will.
It's not opt-out mediation or I-don't-feel-like-it mediation.<eos> We know that, but what can we do?<eos> We can't negotiate with a stone.<eos> Yes, but you can lower your ask.<eos> Given the set of facts I'm looking at, well, it's way too high.<eos> And the law is far from clear as to...<eos> Then let's go to court.<eos> Look, the judge doesn't want to clutter up his docket.<eos> That's why he empowered me to keep you here as long as I want to reach a compromise.<eos> And I will.
He's a butcher in the French quarter.<eos> His number's in the book.<eos> I'm going to get that drink now.<eos> I'm... I'm gonna top this off.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You cannot trust her.<eos> Well, uh, obviously, it depends on the circumstances.<eos> But the point here is... She would never hurt her family.<eos> Do not let Hap leave this house.<eos> I won't.
Defensive wounds consistent with a fistfight.<eos> So there was a struggle before he was killed.<eos> I did find kerf marks on his right acromion.<eos> Ah, very small kerf marks.<eos> And they're on the right greater tubercle.<eos> And on his right olecranon.<eos> The victim struggles with his assailant and then is struck multiple times on the right side, with something that approximates a tiny saw.<eos> Good work, Dr. Edison.<eos> But I have no answers.<eos> You will.
Right, you're done.<eos> OK, Tubs, you're next.<eos> It won't be like this for ever.<eos> You'll meet a girl who likes you, you won't have to steal her bag.<eos> You're the guy in the mask!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It's you, I recognise your voice, the cut on your hand...<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> No-one can know.<eos> (WHISPERS) I won't.
I think he says he misses your roast dinners.<eos> - It's my husband! - He's saying, he's saying...<eos> He's saying something about a ring.<eos> - I lost my wedding ring.<eos> - A wedding ring.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's in the U-bend of the sink of the downstairs bathroom. OK, OK.<eos> He says don't try and get it out yourself. You'll only make a mess of it.<eos> Get a plumber. OK.<eos> I will.
OK, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but I just couldn't stop thinking about what Tuffnut said last night.<eos> Toothless can't come and go like the other dragons, and that's just not fair.<eos> I was up all night, and I think I found a way to fix that.<eos> No way!<eos> You built him a new tail?<eos> So he's gonna be able to fly without you!<eos> Wow! What a great gift.<eos> What if he never comes back?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course he will.
I'm considering a purchase.<eos> Come on, now, Rossi, you know we're not buying that.<eos> What's really going on?<eos> Look, it was a late night with Ringo and not enough coffee.<eos> I mean, the guy's a world-class drummer, but don't think I didn't wipe the floor with him in rock band.<eos> All right, what do you think?<eos> He could be telling the truth.<eos> I only played him to the easy level.<eos> I can't tell.<eos> And you never will.
That's why I need to talk to this reporter. Ask her a few questions.<eos> You don't need that<eos> - to ask questions.<eos> - Let me just take care of this. What do you care, huh?<eos> What, you the loyal son all of a sudden?<eos> I'm counsel for the club. If she's really sitting on<eos> Bruno's murderer, she's gonna be surrounded by Feds. You think they're gonna let John Bianchi walk in that door?<eos> Fine.<eos> Do it. But if I don't have a name by the end of the day...<eos> You will.
You made one with her, the-the lady of the house.<eos> Vivien.<eos> That's Violet's mother.<eos> And I can't give you that baby anymore.<eos> Everything's changed, Nora.<eos> I'm in love with Violet.<eos> I see.<eos> I just can't take her brother away.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I will.
One more push.<eos> One more big push.<eos> Here she comes. Come on, push!<eos> Come on, honey, push!<eos> Push!<eos> Push, honey!<eos> God, I love you.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I never wanted to lose you.<eos> You never will.
I love you.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> You're weak.<eos> You let this place get the better of you.<eos> The house didn't do this to me. You did this to me.<eos> If I catch you peeping in my windows one more time, I'm going to send Travis out to ruin the other half of your face.<eos> They're selling the house.<eos> No matter.<eos> I've told you... no one can own this house.<eos> No one ever will.
- I'm gonna go get your slippers.<eos> - You're...<eos> - You're starting again.<eos> - I told you I wasn't going to stop.<eos> Do you want the ones with the little bunny ears, or the slipper socks? - What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going to wear them.<eos> I'm not going to pull a splinter out of your feet.<eos> - I don't have a splinter.<eos> - You will!
- if you boys want in.<eos> - Sure, why not?<eos> Friendly little game, right?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> The friendliest.<eos> Chicks love that.<eos> You're lucky the game was postponed.<eos> Otherwise I'd be pounding you right now.<eos> - I'd like to see you try.<eos> - Oh, you will.
You all squared away?<eos> I'm set, thanks.<eos> Are you coming, shiv?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> You know, just give me a second.<eos> Of course.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I don't want to mess anything up for you.<eos> You won't.
I'm not going to make it that easy.<eos> Nice to see you, too!<eos> Where's Merlin?<eos> He's alive.<eos> The last I saw of him, he was still alive.<eos> Dispatch patrols at first light.<eos> Scour every inch of the forest.<eos> Yes, sire.<eos> We will find him, Gaius.<eos> We will.
You think we should release it?<eos> It's coming out either way.<eos> The only thing you can control is when and what it means.<eos> - What it means?<eos> - You're the Facebook generation, sir.<eos> Every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo from some dumb college buddy.<eos> Krystal Ball and the reindeer nose.<eos> - Well, she lost.<eos> - Yes. But she didn't release it.<eos> You will.
I know you'll stay, Pete.<eos> You'll stay no matter what.<eos> But...<eos> I don't want that.<eos> That is no life for me or for Lucas.<eos> And... and I know you are more comfortable sticking than being the guy who leaves, so, um...<eos> So I'll... I'll leave you.<eos> If you can't do it but that's really what you want, if you don't love me...<eos> If you don't love me anymore, then ask me to leave...<eos> And I will.
Keep her out of it.<eos> She's six years old.<eos> I understand your concern.<eos> However, your wife was murdered, and we don't know what happened in that room.<eos> It's best if Melrose spoke to a doctor.<eos> Hey. This nice lady is going to ask you some questions, okay?<eos> But Hoppa, I want to be here when Mommy wakes up.<eos> We're going to see about that, okay?<eos> Please look out for my daughter.<eos> I will.
I'm stuck, though.<eos> Well, you know, I've been in this situation myself more than a couple of times, so...<eos> Tell you what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna lend you the $400, okay, but it's a one-time thing.<eos> - Yes. - I know that you're working - Of course.<eos> very hard, but it's not cutting it.<eos> So obviously you're going to have to figure something else out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're a smart girl.<eos> You will.
This is what we do.<eos> I think my emotions will impair my ability to do this mission well.<eos> So I'm not doing it.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's late.<eos> What are you doing here? Did you finish the race?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was exhilarating.<eos> I've never done anything like that.<eos> And I never will again.
My fault, my fault.<eos> Back to the sharks.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Finish your homework.<eos> Oh, so you don't have your daughter's number programmed in your phone?<eos> That's weird.<eos> - I don't know how to. - Uh-huh.<eos> Maybe you should come back when Lucy's back?<eos> - She'll be back tomorrow.<eos> - No, she won't.
Right here, yeah. Yes, I see.<eos> Let's see... (Just filling it in... )<eos> How long would you sponsor a child like this for?<eos> Usually till they're eighteen. Eighteen?<eos> How old is she now?<eos> She's seven.<eos> Seven? A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy.<eos> Mm. So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will. Will she? Mm-hmm.
He wants you to notice his new tattoo.<eos> Oh, another tattoo, huh?<eos> You really don't wanna be buried in a Jewish cemetery.<eos> Tacos Mi Corazon was having a special offer.<eos> Get free tacos for life ifyou get a tattoo of their logo.<eos> You don't wanna be buried in a Mexican cemetery either.<eos> The joke is on you, because my corpse will be unrecognizable.<eos> Only you would spend hundreds of dollars on a tattoo just to get a free 99-cent food item.<eos> Well, it also affords me the ability to threaten to get food on your clothes every day.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.
We're going to split the cost of private school, Alicia.<eos> That's non-negotiable.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Where are we at with Grace?<eos> No TV, no computer except homework.<eos> No calls except to us. And no calling Jimmy Patrick.<eos> That's that Christian kid she was with?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'll talk to him.<eos> No, I will.
I have to go home and do the laundry and I have to feed the puppy.<eos> You can do the laundry tomorrow and feed your dog later.<eos> My dog... If I don't feed him on time, he will go crazy.<eos> Then just let him go crazy.<eos> How crazy can he get?<eos> I understand your good intentions, but I'm sorry.<eos> I don't need your understanding. It would be good if you just come.<eos> If it's not your father's funeral or something serious like that, then please stay and join us.<eos> She definitely won't come.<eos> She will this time.
I can't abandon Kurisu. I can't let her die and then keep living.<eos> What would the point of that be?<eos> I...<eos> You can run away...<eos> You can run away, but that'll just make it worse! Shut up!<eos> No matter how many times you time leap, you can't get past the 1% barrier! We don't know until we try!<eos> You'll just see Mayuri die!<eos> Again...<eos> It'll destroy you.<eos> It won't...
I can't take a taxi.<eos> Can't you just be normal?<eos> I thought you'd be flying.<eos> If I were normal, my music would sound like yours.<eos> Give me my MP3.<eos> I didn't come here to give you that.<eos> Didn't I tell you to come for it?<eos> All the songs you wrote are in there.<eos> What if I pretend I wrote them all?<eos> You won't.
I can't help it if my mother's an actress!<eos> Why are you being so fucking strident?<eos> - "Strident"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I called you strident?<eos> Yeah. You should leave.<eos> Okay, I will.
The prize is near, Father.<eos> Soon you will have not only the mask, but the blood to fill it.<eos> Marique, how your mother yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.<eos> Imagine the secrets she will bring back from the realm of the dead.<eos> And imagine how indomitable I will become when she's once again by my side.<eos> Father...<eos> If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
Come on! Snowy, after him!<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> - Got you!<eos> - Steady on.<eos> I've lost him!<eos> You must find my wallet.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I have to get it back.<eos> And you will.
It's time for lunch, so get with you.<eos> Rain Man and Spud, rode my bed.<eos> Spud, do you want all at school must think you're a sissy?<eos> It did not expect to.<eos> And therefore I with a mission.<eos> It becomes dangerous.<eos> It gets crazy.<eos> We can be kicked out of school. We may even die.<eos> Who is on a prohibited completely mad dip?<eos> I will not.
Retiree.<eos> -Pretty perceptive for a retiree.<eos> -Yeah, well, what's your point?<eos> I was hoping that you could just listen to this tape...<eos> Lady, I never told you anything about helping you.<eos> All I need is a few seconds for you to listen to it.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's taken me a while here, but I finally found a way to make this place work.<eos> I got it, and it'll take all of 2 minutes.<eos> -It won't.
You know I'm going through a really painful time, and you're acting like you don't give a shit.<eos> It's just a book.<eos> And a movie.<eos> Still, it doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> I need you to sign this.<eos> No.<eos> I am not gonna help you sue your brother.<eos> For the sake of the family, would you just give up your lawsuit?<eos> I will not.
Goodness, honey.<eos> I did not put her up to this.<eos> - Coke? Diet Coke? - No, I don't want a Diet Coke.<eos> Step aside!<eos> - Jerry, I would like to talk to you.<eos> - You're gonna bust a cap in my ass?<eos> What if I get the ratings up?<eos> We've got six weeks.<eos> What if I move that needle just enough?<eos> - You won't.
Did the name I got you- did it help?<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> It could be a big break.<eos> Did you find her?<eos> Look, um, I'm sorry.<eos> I - I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I... I have to get going.<eos> Well, where are you headed?<eos> Just got to tell my wife that we've lost everything.<eos> But that's not what our broker statement says.<eos> No, but the next one will.
No, you had to. You had to.<eos> I mean, he was going to go to the press.<eos> You had to bring him on board.<eos> Can I rely on him anymore?<eos> I mean, is he going to fall apart on me again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then bring him here.<eos> I need to look him in the eye.<eos> I already asked him to come.<eos> He won't.
impossible!<eos> - ridiculous.<eos> It's a pleasure..<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - pleasure..<eos> Oh Jigar.. you did it again. It was fantastic!<eos> Thanks Shimmer.. I was a little nervous.. as always.<eos> Jigar, When will you teach me to dance?<eos> I will.. I will!
And they threatened hurt me.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just really, really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry Mrs..<eos> - Sorry is not good enough.<eos> That's just not good enough.<eos> Thank you for asking for leniency for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you, I did it for your mom.<eos> My mom won't forgive me.<eos> She will.
They can be brutal.<eos> They can shut you down mega fast.<eos> No more Chippewa casinos. You need our help, chief.<eos> - You heard Mike's proposal?<eos> - It's a tough call. It's a hell of a fees you're asking for.<eos> - But think of the billions that you're gonna saved.<eos> I can guaranteed you that goddamn Jena tribe casino will never opens.<eos> And before you know it, the Jena tribe gonna be back selling moccasins.<eos> You know, Mr. Abramoff, we can't afford to lose this one.<eos> You won't.
It's not a box, it's a brick, you dumb moron.<eos> Oops!<eos> I've been trying to open it all day!<eos> - Can he say, "Zoo-wee Mama"?<eos> - No, it's not funny.<eos> Well, I think it is.<eos> I like Zoo-wee Mama.<eos> You know what? If you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Where is he?<eos> Fuck off, Aldous.<eos> Your dad's a piece of shit moocher.<eos> You see how she talks about me dad? Imagine that.<eos> Anyways, we really should get...<eos> He had a heart attack last month, my dad.<eos> Look how she mugs him off.<eos> Disgusting.<eos> Well, if you like the bastard so much, why don't you go and visit him when you're in America?<eos> Perhaps I will.
Pick up something, join us.<eos> (Jeannle) Dad, what happened?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I better lay down.<eos> My legs are cold.<eos> can't feel my toes.<eos> She said you might have trouble with your circulation.<eos> Your hands are warm.<eos> I don't wanna die alone.<eos> You won't.
Guess who we found.<eos> Starts with T and ends with a..."Urtle"?<eos> It's over. Call off the logging.<eos> The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.<eos> You think I care about what the law says?<eos> Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?<eos> I care about power, you pinheads!<eos> And I'm gonna get it. Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
Keep your eye on the little bear.<eos> Look at the skills.<eos> Amazing!<eos> And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.<eos> You think I care about what the law says?<eos> Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> - Some stupid park for families to picnic in? - No. No.<eos> No. I care about power, you pinheads!<eos> Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
He's not done yet.<eos> It's the Kensington sniper all over again.<eos> What's a Kensington sniper?<eos> A few years ago, a guy shot four strangers and then his own wife, trying to make a personal killing look like a serial.<eos> The guard works for the woman's husband.<eos> I think the two victims were just a decoy.<eos> The guard is gonna kill her.<eos> I need to be in that elevator right now. Move. Right.<eos> Please don't let him kill me, Ben.<eos> I won't.
It's not that I don't think I can, it's just that I don't know how to do it.<eos> -lt just comes involuntarily.<eos> -l think you can.<eos> I don't have any control over what happens to me.<eos> I think you could.<eos> I think if you want to.<eos> I wanted to get better last time, though.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I know. I failed you that time.<eos> But this time, I won't.
When I travel, I need to go farther.<eos> I know, 'cause you're smaller, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> My life is harder than you think.<eos> - I need more money.<eos> - I know. You told me.<eos> For your family, right?<eos> I don't have family.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe one day I will.
Crying is a part of feeling, all right?<eos> You want some breakfast? I'II cook you up some eggs.<eos> - I have a boyfriend.<eos> - That's not a problem for me.<eos> I should've just told you about the interview, about everything.<eos> You know, no matter what.<eos> No. You know, we'II figure it out.<eos> We'II just figure it out.<eos> I know that you keep saying that we're gonna figure it out but we haven't.<eos> But we will.
Nice.<eos> So picking through my brain's okay. But letting' me into yours? Forget it.<eos> Look". I know she's in love with you.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> But she's in love with me, too.<eos> She just won't admit it to herself.<eos> I can't tell you if you're right.<eos> Then let me ask you something.<eos> If she chooses me...<eos> She won't.
She wasn't.<eos> So it didn't take anyone by surprise when she up and left with the child.<eos> No, stop!<eos> Hungry, ain't you?<eos> No one left to feed you anymore.<eos> But Daddy won't let you go hungry.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you know that pain.<eos> I won't let you know the pain this world's got.<eos> I won't.
Lost in bloodlust and insanity.<eos> With time itself resurrecting them, to find new ways of dying, over and over again, a travesty of life.<eos> Isn't it better to end it, at last?<eos> Thank you for your opinion.<eos> I will NOT die!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> A billion years of Time Lord history riding on our backs.<eos> I will not let this perish.<eos> I will not!
How about never?<eos> So don't walk in here like we're family.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you just get the fuck out of here before I collect that bounty myself?<eos> Do you want us to come in and wait with you?<eos> No no no.<eos> I'm gonna be all right.<eos> We're right next door if you need anything.<eos> Please let us know the minute you hear from Bobby, okay?<eos> Okay, I will.
It is totally irrational.<eos> We could say the same thing this whole journey.<eos> How old?<eos> Greater than ourselves.<eos> T-om! Think you'll be well when you get to Santiago?<eos> Sure. T-ú is by eating the lamb. There's nothing like few kilograms of lamb to reduce excess weight.<eos> It is part of the experience the road.<eos> You can not come to Spain and not eating roast lamb.<eos> "Where will cross the path of the wind with the stars."<eos> What size waist will this guy?
Cole told me.<eos> He works at N-gen.<eos> He saw a guy who took it there turn.<eos> What?<eos> God, I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You could turn into one of those things.<eos> What?<eos> No, I won't.
Sure.<eos> Can I lie down?<eos> So you stole a wallet and threw it away?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's how he--<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know why I do what I do.<eos> You ought to stop, Whatever you're doing,<eos> Maybe I will.
You hear me?<eos> Bye.<eos> This is my best friend Janne.<eos> He has a missus but no digibox.<eos> You've got a hex key for this?<eos> Where is it from?<eos> - From the TV stand.<eos> That won't hold your TV.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> It won't.

The messenger has been put to grass.<eos> And you will follow, if a word of this transaction parts your lips again.<eos> I shit myself.<eos> Ashur?<eos> Ashur.<eos> Young Pietros!<eos> How does the day find you?<eos> As the night, filled with worry.<eos> Barca never returned.<eos> Nor will he.
the name is gus!<eos> Gus!<eos> turn around, walk out. Forget you ever saw me.<eos> Go have a drink. toast to a job well done.<eos> Leave me to do what i have to do.<eos> We can live with that, can't we?<eos> i can't.<eos> easy, little sis. drop it, ewan.<eos> we both know you're not gonna shoot your older brother.<eos> no, but i will.
How could you want to chase around some human who would freak the fuck out if he knew what you are?<eos> You really think you can take up with that boy?<eos> We ain't supposed to mix!<eos> -lt's your duty to mate with Felton.<eos> -But I don't love Felton.<eos> You ain't gotta love him.<eos> You lie under him, bear his kids, keep his bloodline going.<eos> -Especially now that you done ruined mine.<eos> -l can't go back there.<eos> I won't.
Come.<eos> I think over again my small adventures, my fears, those small ones that seemed so big.<eos> For all the vital things I had to get and reach, and yet there is only one great thing, the only thing, to live to see the great day that dawns and the light that fills the world.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> That's because that shit is Inuit.<eos> And we all is used to lesser religions.<eos> I'm gonna have to sit this one out.<eos> I guess I don't have the endurance that you all have.<eos> Oh, not to worry.<eos> You will one day.
Where were we?<eos> This will eventually kill you.<eos> You'll be killing Telford too.<eos> That might just work out for the best given that he's been compromised.<eos> I have a full rundown of the personnel aboard Destiny, and I doubt very much that civilians or the scientists would have endured this, so the question is whether or not Colonel Young would have put himself in this situation, or...<eos> Send his first Lieutenant, Scott? How do you know I'm someone aboard Destiny? That's a fair question.<eos> You can make this stop.<eos> If I answer your question, you're gonna kill me.<eos> Either way I'm dead.<eos> I won't.
Good work.<eos> Want to do it again?<eos> Ok, to the tree and back.<eos> Okay, on your mark, get set, go.<eos> Same time if you're tired.<eos> We'll do more once your breath pick up a bit.<eos> Jen, I have to be going.<eos> You want to come say bye to me?<eos> Troy, just still take good care of her.<eos> Yes, I will.
What else could I do?<eos> He said he was going to live to 126.<eos> I had to protect his image from being tarnished<eos> I had to think about his legacy.<eos> - Well, who knows?<eos> - Not a single soul,<eos> - And don't you tell anybody.<eos> - We have to turn him over to the f.B.I.<eos> You can't ask me to do that.<eos> I won't!
Okay, sweetie, enough.<eos> Hey, I wasn't done.<eos> Nicki?<eos> Do you know how much she's making selling that TV-trading-post junk to shut-ins?<eos> - Look what I found.<eos> - It is none of our business.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You need to tell Bill.<eos> Well, you're assuming she hasn't already.<eos> All right, I will.
Nothing's ready. We can do it here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> We'll do it here. She's right over there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sonia?<eos> I'm Amy Pindus.<eos> You left me a message?<eos> I need to get him to accept his hand.<eos> He won't.
How's she doing?<eos> Really well.<eos> She just had abdominal surgery, so she's gonna have to stay here a few days.<eos> And then I can take her home, right?<eos> What do you mean, I got no claim on her?<eos> We've been a family for six years.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Raymond, but you and Cydie's mother weren't legally married, and since you didn't petition to be the child's guardian...<eos> I love that kid like she's my own.<eos> I don't need no piece of paper.<eos> The court will.
She wouldn't be dead.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I'm sorry that that happened.<eos> And I can see how you would feel terrible, but you're a smart man.<eos> And you know deep down that it's not your fault.<eos> You have to let yourself off the hook.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> I'll go home with you and we'll pack up Yelena's stuff together.<eos> Listen, Veronica, thanks again for everything, and please tell reverend Todd that I said I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
Shorty here has a bit of a problem.<eos> He likes the brown stuff.<eos> Can't stop sticking it in his veins.<eos> - What's going on out there?<eos> Any new players on the street?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> That's why I'm sitting in an alley, shivering, puking!<eos> Is there a drought?<eos> - Ain't talking without no cash in hand.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Yes, sir.<eos> There definitely seems to be more activity in recent weeks.<eos> The press are calling it a crime wave.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Crime wave?<eos> I'm not sure, sir.<eos> .. running out of men.<eos> Uh, yes, Commissioner.<eos> Promise me you will help.<eos> Yes, sir, I will.
It's all right.<eos> Let the music fill you up.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> {\$CARTON}<eos> I cannot thank you enough for getting him in.<eos> {\$CARTON}<eos> If you ever wanna help more of us, there's a place I'd like you to visit.<eos> We could use a doctor... And a siren.<eos> This'll help get you there.<eos> - I will.
It's gonna happen, and you're gonna save her.<eos> Fine.<eos> You really think you can get us out of here?<eos> Let me see you try.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> See?<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're trapped here, forever.<eos> We got to do something with her.<eos> That we will, eli.
At this point, the company has too much invested in you To cut ties. But we do need you to make a change.<eos> Take a wife, start a family.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> No, it'll put your life in balance, calm you down... So there will be fewer incidents.<eos> A wife?<eos> I can't do that again.<eos> Sure, you can.<eos> That cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
You shouldn't have done this to me. You pushed me to do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just go away, please.<eos> Just taking stock of the home ec supplies.<eos> You see, our home ec program teaches practical skills... like food service preparation.<eos> Can't feed a child sheet music, Will.<eos> I suppose you could for a while, but... they'd be dead in a month.<eos> - I'd like to buy you a beer.<eos> - [Scoffs] No, no. I want to convince you that you're wrong.<eos> - You won't.
Using devon is our best option.<eos> Sydney won't go to her superiors with his identity Until she definitively knows Whether she has turned him or burned him.<eos> When sydney contacts him, He'll do what she says just long enough for us To track her, find her and bring her in.<eos> You mean I have to do what she says? No, you don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> This is my family we're talking about here.<eos> It's the only way to keep him safe.<eos> Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.<eos> If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.<eos> I will, devon.
A hundred pounds?<eos> I'd lend it to you gladly if I could, but I need it to buy next year's wool.<eos> - When would you need it returned?<eos> - Early spring.<eos> Can you manage it?<eos> No.<eos> No, not unless...<eos> Why can't I sell you next year's wool?<eos> - You haven't got it yet.<eos> - But I will, in the spring.
Yes!<eos> Have I missed it?<eos> Good on you!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Oh, stop swearing, Norman.<eos> To hell with it.<eos> This is amazing, isn't it, Jim?<eos> - Yeah! You'll always remember today, won't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- That's not what we discussed.<eos> - I know. And I'm sorry.<eos> But he deserves to know the truth about who he is. No.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> Things have never been better between us.<eos> I can't lose him again. - I can't.<eos> - You won't. Once he knows the whole story.<eos> Walter. You saved his life.<eos> I am sure that he will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
What are you implying?<eos> You've kept information from me since I met you.<eos> Information that's prevented me from understanding the origin of many, if not all of the cases I've investigated while with Fringe division.<eos> And I know about Peter.<eos> I know the whole story.<eos> Does Peter know?<eos> Have you told him?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm going to.<eos> - No. You won't.
Walter, God is science.<eos> God is polio and flu vaccines and MRI machines, and artificial hearts.<eos> If you are a man of science, then that's the only faith we need.<eos> Then allow me to serve as a precautionary tale.<eos> There will be repercussions if you pull Arlette from that car.<eos> You don't know how things will be changed by your actions, but they will.<eos> It's not our place to adjust the universe.<eos> And you will never be able to look at her again without knowing that, just like every time I look at my son.<eos> I have traveled through madness to figure this out.<eos> And you will too.
That's who he is again.<eos> He wants you to take your name back, And your life back.<eos> And he says it's nice to see a really old friend.<eos> I see it.<eos> My mom.<eos> She's waiting for me.<eos> Then go and be with her.<eos> Tell glen he was always right About family.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> I will.
For giving ihis fear and feeding yours.<eos> They're always there.<eos> The love you want, You can't get that from someone else--<eos> Husbands, girlfriend.<eos> Even if your parents gave it to you now, it'd be too late.<eos> He's saying that the love you need to find Isn't romantic love; That you can't find it with somebody else.<eos> That sounds grim.<eos> Tell her it's all around her.<eos> It's in her heart right now, Waiting for her.<eos> I will.
This thing wouldn't work on anybody.<eos> Wanna bet?<eos> I have to tell hunter that it worked.<eos> You've been scared of your own shadow Since you were a kid.<eos> Well, I have a very scary shadow.<eos> My hair often makes horns.<eos> - That rubber spider didn't scare a five-year-old girl.<eos> Yes, it did.<eos> Mike's been trying to scare her since the third grade, But he never has.<eos> And he never will.
It's too much drama and I'm overwhelmed as it is.<eos> I want it to be normal.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, who should my lawyer talk to?<eos> Lawyer?<eos> You have a lawyer?<eos> No, but I will.
Promise me no more slow.<eos> Well, what if it's the good kind of slow?<eos> And realize no matter how long it took, It was worth the wait.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I spent 18 years Accepting the fact my mother was dead.<eos> I was misguided... to let one of my father's girlfriends<eos> To hope things may be different.<eos> Your real mother would never turn her back On a chance to know you.<eos> I don't have a real mother, blair.<eos> I never will.
I need to get it into the proper hands.<eos> But the Republic guards are hunting you, which means...<eos> Whoever doctored this recording is likely in the government itself.<eos> If you set foot inside the Senate, they'll take you.<eos> And the disk will be destroyed before anyone can see it.<eos> Which is why you must take the disk to Padmé.<eos> Blast it.<eos> Where will you be while I'm in the Senate?<eos> - What if they find you?<eos> - They won't.
What about that man in the road?<eos> - Was he a?<eos> - From what I could tell, yeah.<eos> You didn't know him?<eos> If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him.<eos> I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the Vamp Bar and Grill.<eos> Where are we You brought me to a bar?<eos> I'm not old enough.<eos> They're not gonna let me in.<eos> Sure they will.
Happy's a welcome addition.<eos> Tell them.<eos> Tacoma's growing a little thick.<eos> I was hoping to jump to a smaller charter.<eos> You thinking about coming back to Charming?<eos> Yeah, gonna put in a request to transfer next church.<eos> That in's on Tig, brother.<eos> We'll make it happen.<eos> All right, man.<eos> We will?
- Where is he? - Over there.<eos> - Too right I'll fucking batter him. - That's nasty.<eos> - What's he done to you?<eos> - He dug me up.<eos> - Did you sort it?<eos> - Benny did.<eos> Ah, Benny did!<eos> Bring him up here, I'll kick his fucking head in.<eos> - He's all right. - Is he fuck, mate.<eos> You'll fucking what?
Yeah, you're right.<eos> It's a stupid question cos the answer's kind of obvious.<eos> No scrapes on your hands means you didn't try to break your fall, means you were either out cold or totally disoriented when you went down.<eos> No sign of trauma, other than the cut, means no one hit you in the head.<eos> Powder burn on your jacket sleeve means someone shot a gun.<eos> All right, Eddie.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I don't care what you guys are into.<eos> If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again.<eos> What will?
You've been drinking a lot.<eos> That's why I didn't say, "Drive away with me."<eos> I screwed up.<eos> I never should have let you go.<eos> Dump the 22-year-old, and you'll never have to worry about anything for the rest of your life.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> And tomorrow morning, when you wake up, you'll be really relieved I didn't.<eos> Ah, you know, I'm good-looking, I'm rich.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Junior.<eos> Dad.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just want this mix-up at the bank straightened out, all right?<eos> I mean, why is your name still on the account as a trustee?<eos> Not to worry. I'll...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> All right, well, you know, you could have just done it with a phone call.<eos> Sure.<eos> And I will.
- I want say I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - Not sad?<eos> - No!<eos> - You want marry me later, you call.<eos> - I'll do that!<eos> Now I go visit my grandchild.<eos> You know, I have little baby.<eos> - Oh, give them hugs from me!<eos> - I will. Goodbye.
It's been a while since you did this for me.<eos> I've troubled you a lot back then...<eos> This is the first time for me.<eos> Oh right... my mistake. let's go.<eos> it's the real deal.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> Nagato...<eos> Are you going to wait in that clubroom?<eos> I will.
What a joke. Santa, we're here to put the coolant, not that one.<eos> If we open that here.. ..people will go crazy with a fit of laughter<eos> Why is that?<eos> - Because this contains laughing gas.<eos> It's called nitrous oxide.<eos> We have to deliver it to the dentist, later.<eos> And that's the tooth haha..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Bob, I want to speak the truth, and I will.<eos> - No, you won't.

I don't think so.<eos> I called the minister.<eos> He's going to do the Christening.<eos> He's going to do the memorial, too.<eos> For my mother.<eos> He said we could do them at the same time.<eos> You need to check with your dad.<eos> No. I told the minister you're Charlie's Godfather.<eos> Maddie, your father won't allow...<eos> Yes, he will.
They're onto us.<eos> They're watching us.<eos> He wants to hang me for Katya.<eos> Maybe you set me up.<eos> Sweeney finds the body, he comes looking for me.<eos> I called the minister.<eos> He's going to do the Christening.<eos> I told the minister that you're Charlie's Godfather.<eos> Maddie, your father won't allow...<eos> Yes, he will.
Just until things settle down.<eos> You don't have to feel so guilty.<eos> And I can get my head screwed back on.<eos> Where is all this coming from?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I am... too far in.<eos> I understand that you're scared, and all the reasons that you don't trust.<eos> Don't you know by now, Peyton, this is what I want?<eos> I have never lied to you.<eos> And I never will.
- Of course.<eos> - Is that allowed?<eos> Well, it's going to be quite tough if you don't do something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So who is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Oh, come on or do we have to pretend you don't already know?<eos> It might be more fun.<eos> Sir Edmund's such a weasel, I should probably leave you to it.<eos> But you won't.
About what, exactly?<eos> How you cried during a two-man threesome?<eos> Wooden spoons are a huge emotional trigger for me, Lana.<eos> Yeah, and now I know.<eos> And when I tell Pam... so will everybody in the office.<eos> - Oh, is that how you wanna play it?<eos> - Yeah. Fine!<eos> Keep your stupid bounty, then!<eos> And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.<eos> I will.
You can call her.<eos> Call her?<eos> Could you give us, like, one quick second?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll see you at the next hole. okay.<eos> Yeah, we'll, uh, be right there.<eos> There is absolutely no way i'm calling riley... To reminisce about a relationship... That just completely blew up.<eos> Owen likes the dynamic in the script.<eos> What if he senses, like, the major tension between us?<eos> No, no, no, he won't, okay?
That is my problem, Margaret.<eos> After all these months, Little Man still seems intent on behaving as if he must earn his place amongst us.<eos> Miss Lane, I happened to be passing and I was wondering, has a missive arrived for me, post-marked Pontefract?<eos> I'm afraid we no more have a Pontefract epistle today than we did yesterday, Miss Pratt. Or the day before.<eos> Tomorrow, I am certain.<eos> Mum, if the grocer gives you a penny too much in change and you keep it, is that a lie or a fib or a mistake?<eos> That, Minnie, is thieving.<eos> Mmm. I usually find, child, to avoid painful entanglements, the best approach is to keep it simple.<eos> Just tell the truth at all times.<eos> I surely will, mum.
Oh, we're just going to stretch our legs a little.<eos> Don't stray too far because it's easy to get lost around here.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move it.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think I know how to get us out of here.<eos> It would mean me getting out first.<eos> That's a slice of luck.<eos> And then I'd come back for the rest of you.<eos> Of course you will.
And you are going to help us.<eos> We'll find a room for you here.<eos> It'll be pleasant to have some civilised company.<eos> That can't be very comfortable.<eos> I suppose you haven't had a hot shower since the plague hit?<eos> You have one here?<eos> Coal-fired.<eos> Get yourself scrubbed up and we'll talk further.<eos> You have to take me with you. I can't stay here.<eos> Of course we will.
I'm trying to give the team the support it needs<eos> Until his return.<eos> This isn't an office job, hetty.<eos> We don't need a temp.<eos> You're right, this isn't an office job.<eos> I'll get to it when I have a chance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> I will.
You're right. No, I'm not.<eos> My leg's fine, airman.<eos> I've been ordered to take you in the chair.<eos> Consider yourself relieved of your order, kid.<eos> Do what somebody tells you for once.<eos> Hey, this is my first time on american soil In over five years.<eos> I'm gonna walk on it, if you don't mind.<eos> So this is it.<eos> Yep. Unless you want me to do something else for you,<eos> Because honestly I will.
Here are your lacrosse scores.<eos> It's Annabelle.<eos> She's the, uh, the daughter of a woman I was with.<eos> Uh...<eos> A long time ago now.<eos> We were kind of a family for about five years.<eos> But, uh, when the relationship ended, um, we both decided that it would be best to have a clean break, so the last time I saw Annabelle was when she was seven.<eos> And now... she's scoring the winning goal for Brown against Princeton.<eos> Let me know when Karen's done with her first round of treatment.<eos> I will.
Lots of protein for the brain and muscles, a little bit of fat to keep you going.<eos> No bread, so you don't get that carbo crash in a few hours.<eos> Water... to keep you hydrated.<eos> You've done this before.<eos> A few thousand times.<eos> Do you have siblings?<eos> Two younger brothers.<eos> When Lisa's husband left her, I thought it would be a good idea to bring her down here to have some fun.<eos> I'll never forgive myself.<eos> Yes, you will.
Because Payson does want it.<eos> And if you were honest with yourself, you'd admit...<eos> Payson, I'm going to ask you this one last time.<eos> Do you want this surgery?<eos> Tell us, honey.<eos> Tell us why.<eos> Because it's tearing you guys apart!<eos> We love you.<eos> And even if it doesn't sound like it sometimes, we love each other.<eos> And we always will.
Because he expects me to trust him.<eos> And I can't do that.<eos> I feel like I'm betraying Dad by knowing what Marty did... and letting him stand there and make a fool of us all!<eos> I don't know how he can coach me as if he's done nothing wrong!<eos> But I can't be a part of this.<eos> I made a terrible mistake with Marty.<eos> But I made a worse mistake when I asked you... to keep my secret my lie, from your father.<eos> - And for that I am truly sorry.<eos> - It's fine. I'll just quit the National Team.<eos> No, you will not.
Of course, it would be helpful to know exactly when the Chinese are coming.<eos> - Do you have any idea?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> When do you think you will?<eos> Shortly after I invite them, I imagine.<eos> What?<eos> You haven't invited them?<eos> No.<eos> - You told everyone they were coming!<eos> - And they will.
Push on my palm again.<eos> Stuff keeps getting in the way:<eos> his school, my work, life.<eos> It's hard to make the big commitment, you know?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm in a text-only relationship.<eos> How'd he do on the scanner?<eos> Uh, good, but I need to get him to O.R. before his arm hemorrhages again.<eos> That dressing won't last much longer.<eos> No, but that will.
If we left now, we could be on the beach while it was still dark and get breakfast on the way back.<eos> Are you asking me out?<eos> I am, yes.<eos> How unexpected.<eos> I'm going to have to think about it.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, it's just so sudden.<eos> I'm worried you might be moving a little fast.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> No, you won't.
You let pierce walk because you're playing your own angle?<eos> There were three of them, peter!<eos> You shouldn't have let her go!<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> You think what you want to think.<eos> I'll walk from here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Home -- something you don't have right now.<eos> If you don't trust me, you can check my anklet.<eos> I will!
No, they're just gonna take Ava back to juvie, and then they'll arrest you for taking her from there.<eos> We can take care of this on our own.<eos> Well, yeah, but, well, you're supposed to be the sensible one, you know?<eos> Yeah, and you're supposed to take unnecessary risks.<eos> Not when it comes to you.<eos> Oh, they were looking for this egg, this little jeweled egg that Ava had in her pocket, and I called Reynolds and he's gonna put it into the system and see what he can find out.<eos> What's so bloody important about an egg?<eos> Ava won't talk about it.<eos> Well, she'll talk to me.<eos> No, she won't.
- I do. Okay, well, then you need to know that I love you,<eos> I will always be here, and that I'm gonna help you make sure that ultimately, this is gonna be wonderful.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> How's Scott?<eos> Trying to get better.<eos> Checked himself in somewhere last night.<eos> I hope he does. I do. You want to say I told you so.<eos> But I won't.
Well, that's all.<eos> And I love you too.<eos> Whatever you're doing, you can stop.<eos> All you got to do is stop.<eos> And I don't want to see you again.<eos> Understand?<eos> I thought he was with his friends.<eos> He was. Just not in a good way.<eos> You want to speak to him.<eos> I will.
You took long enough getting here.<eos> We're playing Ace of Truth.<eos> And I can tell you we've learned a few things tonight.<eos> - Haven't we, Karen?<eos> - You said it had to be shocking.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Please don't say it.<eos> I'm still feeling queasy.<eos> Who's going to start?<eos> I will.
- We don't need your charity, Nate.<eos> Let's continue this outside.<eos> Molly needs her rest.<eos> - You're just never gonna get it, Nate.<eos> - What do you expect me to do?<eos> So what do you want me to do with these guys?<eos> Give 'em to a sick kid.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> What if your dad comes back to visit?<eos> He won't.
Can you blame them?<eos> I'm from the heights.<eos> Neighborhood went to hell After you murdered pastor Tompkins.<eos> Look, I-I've been living with this for 25 years.<eos> Let me get my violin.<eos> Look, I ain't making no excuses.<eos> You know, I know what I did.<eos> I've spent every day trying to make up for it.<eos> That won't bring the pastor back.<eos> No, it won't.
Worse-case scenario, we take him to surgery to insert a shunt.<eos> I don't want any surgery until we know what's causing this.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> As long as you're holding my grandson's hand, I won't worry.<eos> Any chance of permanent damage?<eos> Not if we move quickly. Thank you.<eos> Any luck getting those medical records<eos> I told you there's no history of anything like this.<eos> Okay. We'll figure out the cause.<eos> We will.
Well, I'll write to Murray.<eos> He won't say anything different.<eos> Well, we have to start somewhere.<eos> Our duty is to Mary.<eos> Well, give him a date for when Mary's out of mourning.<eos> No-one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself!<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
I - I totally meant to call you.<eos> Well, I'm-I'm breaking all my rules coming down here, but nobody stands me up like that.<eos> So, are we going out or what?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... I made a promise to a friend.<eos> I have to say no.<eos> Oh. Oh, I see.<eos> You're trying the "no" thing on me.<eos> You really think that's going to work?<eos> 'Cause it won't.
And be there with my bail money tomorrow.<eos> A'right?<eos> We deserve a home.<eos> We deserve a home.<eos> Now police are aware of the situation here, But they say so far it's been a low-key response to the protest.<eos> It's time to end this!<eos> Will you vacate or do we have to take the door down?<eos> It's unlocked.<eos> Will you step outside?<eos> No, sir, I will not.
Hey, kid, I just got a message from the maid of honor.<eos> Your fncée would like a rd with you.<eos> ck at the inn.<eos> What do you mean, back at the inn?<eos> Allison's not here?<eos> You're not even dresd yet.<eos> Everyone's waiting.<eos> Joe, the girl I've been dreaming about-- e one your cousin strangles-- she's r daughter, Joe.<eos> We don't have a daughter. I mean, not yet.<eos> But we will.
Why am I trying to figure this out when I could be listening to my tapes in the car?<eos> Bye.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Well, it's a shame that you have to die, Lois, but look on the bright side:<eos> You'll be a story on the 6:00 news.<eos> You know, unless a local cat does something funny.<eos> Diane, please, please, don't do this!<eos> I won't tell anybody, I swear to God!<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
Sorry, Bianca.<eos> I only have 126 Saturday nights left before college, and I promised my dad I'd start taking school seriously.<eos> I can't waste one on a nork.<eos> Please?<eos> I already told him you'd go.<eos> Plus, what else are you going to do?<eos> All that's on TV are shows about people who want to dance or can't dance or do dance with overly tan celebrities.<eos> But what if Cameron thinks this is a date and falls in love with me?<eos> Just watching you go through that was so annoying.<eos> He won't.
We want radiance!<eos> Girls, we must do everything we can to show those boys that it is not extravagance that wins the day, but beauty.<eos> Which boy would like to present the horse? ALL CLAMOUR James, you can be the horse.<eos> And who would like to be the doctor? ALL CLAMOUR Lawrence, you be the doctor.<eos> GLASS SMASHES Oh, Lizzie!<eos> It's all right.<eos> We can mend it.<eos> Don't look so fearful.<eos> But you said we must win, Mrs Brown.<eos> We will, girls.
It's like everyone I sent is a sitting duck and Zod's about to call a start to hunting season.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> You've stared down the barrel of a gun before.<eos> We're dealing with a hundred Clarks.<eos> I don't know if I can dodge this speeding bullet.<eos> Well, you're not in it alone.<eos> We're a team. You got me. Hey.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you. But I don't think talking me off a ledge is gonna help us solve our technical difficulties.<eos> Okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.
I thought to call you first.<eos> Call the 911 now.<eos> - Can she talk?<eos> - Yes. She asked me for some water and I gave it to her--<eos> Call the goddamn ambulance.<eos> Have them take her to touro.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?<eos> - All right.<eos> Dominique, call them now, As soon as I hang up the phone, okay?<eos> I will.
Uh... Wait, what just happened here? Fine!<eos> She thinks I won't go?<eos> Well, guess what!<eos> I don't need her!<eos> I, however, do need your keycard.<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> Barry dillon, ease.<eos> Yes, I'll hold!<eos> Oh, d just wait till I get to odin.<eos> I will!
I mean, I know she's your wife, so I should keep my mouth shut, but she can't keep hers shut, so why can't you keep your fucking mouth shut, bitch?<eos> Okay. Time for a little chitchat.<eos> Um, I get the anger, 'cause we're all angry.<eos> But here's the deal... this thing with Neil, you can't keep hiding stuff from him, 'cause it's not cool.<eos> I mean, the engagement was one thing, but come on... you're having the man's baby.<eos> This isn't a game.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, tell him, please.<eos> I will.
She's not.<eos> Nobody can get between us.<eos> Come on, Bones, you've been at it for hours.<eos> You gotta eat something.<eos> In a little while.<eos> Her old court documents from when she was a prosecutor have case numbers, criminal code numbers, and then there are zip codes.<eos> Well, that's great and all, but you know, it's not gonna be any good if you starve yourself to death.<eos> She was laughing at me, Booth.<eos> I-I can't let her win.<eos> She won't.
Talk to Ben.<eos> And say what?<eos> You want me to tell you what to say?<eos> I wish someone would tell me what to say.<eos> Well, I highly recommend the truth.<eos> No one really ever tells the truth, do they?<eos> Yeah, some people do.<eos> Like me, for example.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> All right, I will.
A little mix-up there.<eos> That was Eunice Kennedy. Keep joking.<eos> You're cynical and craven.<eos> Tobacco put a roof over your head and it fed your children.<eos> And then it killed my business.<eos> I never thought you had the stomach for a partnership.<eos> I'm no longer a part of this agency.<eos> You there, get my shoes.<eos> Bert, calm down.<eos> I will not.
Henry was going to pick one up on his way home from work, but he's been so busy.<eos> Betty, he's very ambitious.<eos> He's mad at me.<eos> Why would that be so?<eos> Oh, God, if I can make it through this weekend...<eos> It's a two-year-old's birthday party, and you'll have help, and no one cares.<eos> Is he coming?<eos> I told him about it.<eos> Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.<eos> Well, he won't.
Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I hate having a secret.<eos> I just--I feel so far away from them.<eos> Does it help that I know?<eos> Yeah. Even bobby, sort of.<eos> Well, that, my friend, is what it feels like When you don't have to keep a secret anymore--<eos> Relief.<eos> I just feel like everything's gonna change.<eos> It will.
All right, you happy?<eos> No I am not happy I want more!<eos> You want more? All right.<eos> Happy?<eos> Now come on....<eos> No more come on (laughs)<eos> All right...<eos> Now get your game face on!<eos> You are going to have to tell her sooner or later Brian!<eos> And I will!
He's just not working out.<eos> Yes, now.<eos> It may sound unorthodox but I think our first best option is Jesse Pinkman.<eos> Hello?<eos> No, look.<eos> There's a shorthand that exists between us experience together at a level that, quite frankly, I'm just never going to reach with Gale.<eos> Look, Mr. Fring when I accepted your offer, I was told the lab is mine.<eos> And I know best how to run it.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Yes, I will.
I've got to get my husband an iPad!<eos> Key to a good birthday...<eos> Low expectations.<eos> Thought I was getting an iPad.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages.<eos> Sorry, big Phil.<eos> When it comes right down to it, we're Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.<eos> Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.<eos> He won't.

Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll still finish the record.<eos> I will.<eos> For you.<eos> No.<eos> For you.<eos> For us.<eos> But we are not that far off.<eos> We might just finish this thing by the time you have to leave.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Sit.<eos> Do you know why I am here today? - No.<eos> I want to marry you.<eos> What?<eos> I can't get married.<eos> Why?<eos> You look fine.<eos> Do you want to remain unmarried all your life? - Yes.<eos> And what if you find a strong and fearless man like me?<eos> Still you won't. - No.
With Nirmala.<eos> - I see.<eos> It was mother's wish as well.<eos> I see.<eos> Strange, mother never mentioned it to me.<eos> Are you getting married for mother or yourself?<eos> - Both.<eos> You must have invited the entire village.<eos> Won't you invite me?<eos> - Of course I will.
What happened between Steven and me... It wasn't love.<eos> What was it?<eos> Just sex? Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes!<eos> I mean...<eos> I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't. Aah!
Wait.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I-I just...<eos> I wish I could handle this whole selection process some other way.<eos> You know.<eos> Some... Better way.<eos> It's okay, Will.<eos> It's fine.<eos> My hope is that, uh... You know, when this whole thing is over, we can... Somehow, you know, find some way to - to keep our relationship.<eos> We will.
But with an act of God such as a hurricane, There's nothing in the perpetual care pack--<eos> Damn.<eos> You know who you sound like?<eos> Allstate, yeah.<eos> Come on, ma.<eos> You need to sit somewhere.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> - How could David--<eos> - I'll fix it, ma.<eos> I will.
- Sure.<eos> - So you and Sue are really close, right?<eos> Duh. She's, like, my best friend.<eos> - That's why I need your help. - Okay.<eos> Here's the thing. I'm having this slumber party on Saturday night,<eos> - and you're invited.<eos> - I am?<eos> But I really don't think we should say anything to Sue about it.<eos> Then how will she know to come?<eos> She won't.
Do you think we can manage that?<eos> What I did was not on a whim.<eos> Your brother does not work and play well with others.<eos> It's not Rick's fault.<eos> I had the key.<eos> - I dropped it.<eos> - You couldn't pick it up?<eos> Well, I dropped it in a drain.<eos> If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
- Are you a part of this? You want to hold onto your teeth?<eos> Question is, do you trust that man's word?<eos> No, question is what are you willing to bet on it?<eos> Could be more than them guns.<eos> Could be your life.<eos> Glenn worth that to you?<eos> What life I have I owe to him.<eos> I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank.<eos> He could have walked away, but he didn't.<eos> Neither will I.
Thanks for this.<eos> It's just that, uh...<eos> I always felt there was something more I could've done for my brother, and... maybe he'd still be here.<eos> Guess I'm still just trying to do that little something extra is all.<eos> We always feel that way when we lose someone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, tell you what, while you're here, why don't you go and pick up an application.<eos> The bureau's always looking for a few good men, and, I mean, with your service record...<eos> Tell Jenny in Personnel that I sent you.<eos> I will.
It looks like we've explained everything.<eos> Yes, except why he was killed.<eos> Morning, mother.<eos> Morning.<eos> So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?<eos> Dad, he's gone. Theodore?<eos> When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,<eos> I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.<eos> Oh, he's not gonna hate you. He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
Yeah.<eos> I just... I couldn't trust her, Ty.<eos> And what about me?<eos> You left me too, Dad.<eos> What, you feel duped for raising somebody else's kid? No.<eos> I love you, Ty.<eos> Either way.<eos> Please trust that.<eos> You need to go talk to your mom about this.<eos> Yeah, I will.
So we don't have to worry about it anymore?<eos> It's all done?<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, we both want to thank you.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> It's not nothing.<eos> You said you'd take care of it, and you did, and appreciate that.<eos> So does Jason.<eos> Tell him you're welcome.<eos> I will.
Okay. If I pursue this, no one's gonna uncover his Escalade,<eos> - point out it was never in an accident? - I can't promise anything, but I can't locate it.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's up?<eos> - They've been talking a lot.<eos> Something's brewing.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> Can you tell him I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I will.
Thanks for the gin.<eos> How do you know I like gin?<eos> I like to fuck and then I like to drink gin.<eos> The gin is a present, from Peter.<eos> Right.<eos> Peter mustn't know about us.<eos> No, no he mustn't.<eos> We must never tell Peter anything about these Sunday afternoons we have and what we get up to, must we?<eos> Never, ever.<eos> No, we won't.
I know every bar for miles around.<eos> There's no Henderson's.<eos> Well, it's not like we expected to find her waitin' for us in there.<eos> No, but we are gonna find her, Tommy.<eos> I know, but she could be 50 feet away in some basement here. She could be 50 miles away in, you know, some back alley.<eos> How cold do you think it's gonna get tonight?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We are.<eos> We will.
You got Louis to give you a second chance?<eos> B., that's great.<eos> And to prove that I care about more than his title, I've planned a day of polite interaction with the proletariat.<eos> Think Diana, princess of the people.<eos> Obviously, I'll wear gloves.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> Not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.<eos> Nothing will. Mm.
See, I've been at this a long time.<eos> And any other night of the month, The situation would be reversed, But tonight...<eos> You've been marked.<eos> I want to help, but I don't know what to do.<eos> There's nothing you can do.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> No!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
I got it.<eos> So, what are we gonna do?<eos> Make lunch.<eos> About Katherine.<eos> We're not going to do anything, jeremy.<eos> She tried to kill jenna.<eos> We can't let her get away with that.<eos> Yes, we can. If it keeps us safe, then we can.<eos> What if she tries something else?<eos> She won't.
We are your family.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I want to make a unilateral decision here.<eos> I want this to be my call.<eos> I want haddie to go and I want Amber to go.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then you know what?<eos> You tell her that, Adam.<eos> You tell your daughter that.<eos> Okay, I will.
And then what?<eos> We've accelerated our plans for the residents on the Live Aboard Program.<eos> How long until we can realize our goals?<eos> Our physicians are experimenting on the humans as we speak.<eos> - They're moving as quickly as possible.<eos> The two guards I dispatched to retrieve the hybrid's parents were killed.<eos> Release a Soldier.<eos> No Soldier has ever touched foot on Earth.<eos> If the humans become aware of the level of destruction they are capable of...<eos> They won't.
- I mean, she probably was scared.<eos> - No, I know she was scared.<eos> Believe me, I've had that same look on my face.<eos> When you're staring at something you can't have, but you have to remind yourself to resist it. L...<eos> - It was like a test. She... - I'm sorry, Justin.<eos> I hate being in this place to begin with and now all I see is her standing at the door.<eos> Look, I've changed, Saul.<eos> The whole family keeps telling me that, so why won't she give me a chance?<eos> - Why can't she see that?<eos> - Well, maybe she will.
- Yes, Mom, she's still mad at me.<eos> Could you sit down together, apologize...<eos> This is not something we can work out with an apology,<eos> - so let's just drop it. - Okay. What?<eos> Justin, that would be a start.<eos> Look, sweetheart, you have to talk all of this out.<eos> - That's what you have to do.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Honestly, she'll come back...<eos> - No, she won't, Mom.
The thing is, I realize that taking sides isn't quite as simple as that because, you see, you're my family too.<eos> - Saul, you don't have to...<eos> - Let me finish, please.<eos> I know you don't want anyone to think that you're perfect.<eos> But to me, even with all of this stuff, you two are about as close to perfect as anything I've ever seen.<eos> Yeah. And I guess because I was raised at a time when a real relationship between two men, much less marriage, seemed impossible, you and Kevin were living my dream.<eos> And when I found out what happened, I just... Suddenly, everything seemed less possible again.<eos> Saul, everything is still possible.<eos> Don't let what I did make you give up hope.<eos> I won't if you won't.
I have ears everywhere.<eos> Let me just say that if those ears Hear about anyone talking about me, that person will die.<eos> And I'm not threatening your jobs, I'm threatening your lives.<eos> And I'm serious.<eos> But here's what's happening, In case any of you have heard.<eos> I'm bringing an n.F.L. Team to Los Angeles.<eos> And it won't affect this company, by the way,<eos> Except we all might have really good football seats.<eos> Mike Ovitz couldn't do it.<eos> I will.
I told Walt not to work for a slimebag like Dale.<eos> It was a matter of time before something like this.<eos> Dale?<eos> Dale Lawson.<eos> This guy my brother works for.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Walt's no angel, but he didn't deserve this.<eos> The cops better find out who did this.<eos> Someone's got to bring them to justice.<eos> Someone will.
Oh, no, that's totally fine.<eos> I mean, of course it is, 'cause it's okay with me.<eos> That's really cool!<eos> How did you hear about this underground Ben Harper concert?<eos> Yes, please, enlighten us.<eos> You know, I just, um, you hear things, you know.<eos> You meet people.<eos> So, uh, I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
I'm not doing it.<eos> It could be dangerous if Parvati would talk to Danielle about what I told her that Danielle wants to get rid of Parvati.<eos> It could turn into a problem.<eos> He wanted to blindside you.<eos> - He said that to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He told me that you came up to him and said that you wanted to blindside me now because you don't think you can win against me and all this other stuff.<eos> He's such a liar.<eos> But I'm not voting you tonight.<eos> I won't.
* Monday's to go meatless The misogynous speechless *<eos> * Save the naked morass All y'all gonna * * Gonna beat this They tried to search your lockers *<eos> * I led the insurrection Forget the police * * Send them to detention Vote Kat Stratford *<eos> * It's about time To have a president * * Who speaks up for rights Vote Kat for prez *<eos> Peace.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Can you believe they threw out my script and did this?<eos> It's vulgar.<eos> We're so going to win.<eos> No, we won't.
It's an emergency!<eos> Everybody has an emergency!<eos> Wait your turn!<eos> There's a man who was beaten up.<eos> He's under a cart.<eos> You have to bring him here.<eos> The doctors don't make house calls.<eos> If he is hurt, call the police.<eos> - Maybe they will bring him.<eos> - They won't.
It means Kaylie's number one in the country.<eos> You can't even beat Emily for number two here at The Rock.<eos> Hey, Bob... can I get your input on something?<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Alternate or Olympic contender?<eos> It's up to you, Lauren. She's walking with death<eos> I know it's eight hours later in France, but call me.<eos> As soon as you know anything.<eos> I don't care what time it is.<eos> OK, I will.
And he feeds off of making them powerless.<eos> We had rolling blackouts all last Summer, and this guy wasn't around.<eos> Well, he is now.<eos> And based on the vicious nature of his crimes, the press has named him the Prince of Darkness.<eos> Prince. That'll fuel his ego.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's gonna be all over the news.<eos> Once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
- Well, coming from you, that's high praise.<eos> - Look, now that we've bonded...<eos> - What are the chances of a brief encounter With one of my lonely cigars, Hmm?<eos> - The chances of that are slim to none And slim just left town.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Okay. Then how about a favor instead?<eos> Convince Ted they should complete Their adventure without me.<eos> - What? Why do you need me to tell him that?<eos> - 'cause he'll say no to me.<eos> - And he won't to me?
I'll erase it quickly so it can't be tracked back to them.<eos> What choice do we have?<eos> Do it.<eos> Why did you me?<eos> You're a man with a history of serving your loyalty to the highest bidder.<eos> We want to continue to retain your services.<eos> To do what?<eos> Infiltrate a terrorist group known as the Fifth Column.<eos> And if I say no?<eos> You won't.
Understood.<eos> I got it. What?<eos> She wants money.<eos> Who wants money?<eos> Lizzy. 100 bucks says she asks for a loan.<eos> Good plan.<eos> Either way, you lose money.<eos> Oh, so you're already giving her the loan, huh?<eos> She hasn't asked me for a loan.<eos> But she will.
Cenred's army ride for Camelot on my command.<eos> There is nothing you cannot do.<eos> It is you that gives me strength, sister.<eos> How goes the battle for Uther's mind?<eos> When Cenred marches on Camelot, he will find a kingdom without a leader.<eos> Then finally we are ready.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Merlin suspects me.<eos> Has he told Arthur?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
That I wanted to hurt her.<eos> What do you think these are for?<eos> That's not who I am. It isn't?<eos> Who told me to get rid of her husband?<eos> He deserved it.<eos> Deserved?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Leave that shit to God and look after business.<eos> She starts shooting her mouth off...<eos> - She won't.
Come on now, everyone, eat your cake.<eos> We still haven't found the surprises.<eos> - Anything in there?<eos> - No.<eos> The ring.<eos> It means I'll be married, right?<eos> May it bring you better luck than it did me.<eos> The First Lady of the United States.<eos> What will you do, Nan, if he doesn't send for you?<eos> Well, of course he will.
I could have. Except for one fact:<eos> I don't own a printer, and I fucking hate computers, all kinds.<eos> I come here today, not just to bash on fucking technology but to offer you all a proposition.<eos> Let's face it, y'all fucking suck.<eos> Don't get your feelings hurt.<eos> Don't get sensitive on me.<eos> I fucking suck too right now.<eos> I'm in the darkest Third World hole I've ever been in in my entire life about a thousand hundred million miles from where I should be and the only way for me to get back there is for us to join forces.<eos> If we can make enough noise down here then just maybe, everyone in America will hear us.<eos> Everyone will.
It's just that with your corn-silk hair, you might have stepped right out of its pages. Wow.<eos> Do you, like Lady Chatterley, feel trapped? Emotionally.<eos> Longing, the need, the desire to be held.<eos> Oh, my... This flowery crap actually works on you?<eos> If you had read the book, you would understand, Shawn.<eos> This man has actual insight into the psyche of a woman.<eos> I saw all the Emmanuelle movies, including the one where she changed races.<eos> I got plenty of insight into the female psyche, thank you.<eos> Now, will you admit that your book is dated, and that I have more game than you?<eos> I will not.
What's that called?<eos> Yellow tape.<eos> Crime scene tape.<eos> And it's there for a reason.<eos> Look, we only came over to get a closer look at the ride, because I used to have one just like it.<eos> Gus and I built it from scratch in auto shop.<eos> Spencer, you don't want this case.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> - But you can't have it.<eos> - Oh, but I will.
I got to get to neuro!<eos> Ma'am, we're gonna have to redirect you.<eos> Okay, thank God you guys are here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> You're gonna be okay, Gail.<eos> Hold the fort down while I'm gone.<eos> I will.<eos> And don't let Christina get her paws on it.<eos> I won't.
She's just smiling.<eos> We spent the night together under the stars.<eos> The others don't know.<eos> It's our secret.<eos> Where are the others now? Working.<eos> We're always working.<eos> It's just too late in the season.<eos> It's a waste of time.<eos> Well, we need to try.<eos> And we will, okay?
Look, Ben, I feel really badly about even trying to get back at Amy.<eos> I got a whole new level of understanding of what she went through and is going through.<eos> You guys are really good together.<eos> I really hope things work out between the two of you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And you and Ricky?<eos> No. No, I don't think so.<eos> I know Ricky's never going to forgive me.<eos> Some day.<eos> Some day he will.
Does the name ring a bell?<eos> Steve Price...<eos> No.<eos> Well, we think these two might be targeting you in some way.<eos> If something comes up, please let me know.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Keep those photos.<eos> I will.
As soon as he was on the floor writhing in pain, I could see that the sketch really didn't look that much like him.<eos> Then why did you kick him?<eos> The police did say that these mistakes happen all the time.<eos> Joy, I am so sorry about everything.<eos> You should be.<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> Listen, of all the things that happened tonight, the one thing that I can't get out of my mind is the look on your face when you thought I had finally done this great thing for you.<eos> And then all I did was disappoint you.<eos> I wasn't a good friend, and I will never forgive myself for that.<eos> Of course you will.
'Method: Hands only.'<eos> 'Weapons just for show.'<eos> 'Take your time.'<eos> 'One of them will feel right.'<eos> 'Remember that feeling the first time.'<eos> 'How strong you felt.<eos> You were as strong as me.'<eos> 'Now, pick one.'<eos> 'Because if you don't...<eos> I will.'
Run fast and far.<eos> Make a new life for yourself.<eos> But this is our family.<eos> Exactly. It is. And some of it you get to inherit, and some of it you get to pick, like Marco.<eos> Don't marry him because you're supposed to, because you're already in this far.<eos> Marry him because... you want his face beside yours in a scrapbook your grandkids are looking through, because you can't stand the thought of not waking up next to him when you're 80.<eos> You're making him your life.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> You're scaring me, like we're not gonna see each other again.<eos> We won't, baby.
pick your term. But yeah, that's exactly what we want.<eos> Your other choice is to go to jail... for a very long time.<eos> Now you in... Or out?<eos> You really think flipping this kid makes sense?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're screwing his sister, ty.<eos> It sort of complicates things.<eos> Yeah, okay. I know.<eos> I can handle this, Alex. What if he tips her off, tells her you're a cop?<eos> He won't.
.<eos> Is that the woman whose husband killed you? .<eos> I need to work.<eos> Mr. Meyer likes punctuality, you know.<eos> Good heavens.<eos> Wait, Jiao.<eos> Sasha, hold on.<eos> Without a paddle, you can not canoeing.<eos> He paddle like a wimp.<eos> - Will you? .
I can't believe you'd say that.<eos> Yo, man, the girl's not that hot.<eos> She's only gettin' on you 'cause she's a slut.<eos> Cut.<eos> You know, I...<eos> I can do that better.<eos> It's reality. Rough edges are great.<eos> K.K., you've got visitors.<eos> I love Chelsea.<eos> I always will.
Maybe people shouldn't know.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't know.<eos> If that's what Adrian did today, then it's over.<eos> It's between her and God.<eos> It's not for us to judge.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> So we're too late?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, if she did lie and she was pregnant and she did get an abortion, but we don't know that that's what happened, and if she wants to tell us that that's what happened, then she'll tell us, and if she doesn't tell us, then we leave it at that.<eos> Maybe some day she will.
And that way, you don't have to be involved.<eos> I know that's what you're thinking.<eos> I admitted that's what I'm thinking.<eos> I don't wanna be involved.<eos> And what happens if Adrian decides to have the baby?<eos> You gonna get involved then?<eos> She's not going to do that.<eos> You never know, son.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She won't.
I've got a cauliflower for if a vegetarian comes.<eos> With the barbecue lit, we turned our minds to the guest list.<eos> Well, I've invited Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp...<eos> Oh, you invited Johnny as well?<eos> I invited Johnny Depp.<eos> He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come.<eos> She will.<eos> - No, she won't.
Why would the killer put lye on the body?<eos> Lye is an accelerant.<eos> Have you identified what made those ligature marks yet?<eos> An accelerant like lye would have helped the fire destroy the body.<eos> That's not how he died.<eos> Thought you said there was blunt-force trauma?<eos> There was, but that's not what killed him.<eos> You'll never guess.<eos> He drowned.<eos> Or maybe you will.
Get out of here, you whore!<eos> Get out!<eos> Aharon to Aharon,what now?<eos> What else to do?<eos> Aharon to Aharon, there's one more goodbye left.<eos> I wish we had bigger signals.<eos> When you're a kid, you see these things instantly.<eos> When you grow up, you have other things on your mind, you don't walk with your head in the ground.<eos> If I make it...<eos> Of course you will.
I think I might go to that larping thing.<eos> OK. I mean... Do you, like, mind if I go, too?<eos> Why would I mind?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You just seem kind of...<eos> Look, I can't help it if Trent likes me.<eos> OK, first of all, you don't actually know that he likes you.<eos> And I can't believe you think I'm even still thinking about that.<eos> You should go to the thing.<eos> Great. I will.
We both know you can shape destiny.<eos> You have done it before, so do it now for Bo.<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> This is not a game.<eos> What are you gonna do, help everybody else, just not Bo?<eos> Do you really think I didn't try to fix this thing with Aife long ago?<eos> I have rooms of books filled with my blood.<eos> Every time, something horrible went wrong.<eos> I can't use my blood again.<eos> I won't.
How'd you guys get here?<eos> We walked.<eos> Don't be mad, Dexter.<eos> They wanted to see where it happened.<eos> Where they lost their mother.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Astor, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.<eos> I should have brought you back here, like you asked.<eos> If you want to move back here, then we will. We'll find a way to make it work.<eos> No, we won't.
Absolutely.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I lost it in there,<eos> If you let her get under your skin, about the living together thing, and about... the other thing that she mentioned-we're not gonna get anywhere.<eos> What is that other thing?<eos> Remember:<eos> Tough.<eos> Silent.<eos> Do not let her get under your skin.<eos> She's, she's not.<eos> She won't. What?
I'll bukkake you.<eos> - Gross.<eos> Technically, you can't.<eos> I mean it. Go!<eos> Nice red leather shoes you're wearing.<eos> Tell me, do you enjoy thinking about the cow that was skinned to make them, or do you just block that part out for the sake of being fashion-forward?<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Curse words were invented by people too stupid to think of an intelligent response.<eos> - You should print that on a T-shirt.<eos> - Yeah, maybe I will, Rebecca.
I've seen a lot of children.<eos> We'll keep an eye on Harrison, but I really think your son is gonna be perfectly fine.<eos> Ooh. He wants his head back.<eos> Ahh. Children Harrison's age can exhibit what might seem like violent behavior, but they're just releasing energy.<eos> It's important not to read into it.<eos> I'll try not to.<eos> The most important thing you can do right now is take care of yourself.<eos> Find some time to release your own energy.<eos> Do something for Dexter.<eos> Dexter will.
- We need to talk about it. - Yeah, but probably not when I've got an hysterical teenager, freaking out about head lice and I'm about to do my nut!<eos> Here, use this.<eos> I get nits about five times a year and it's really good stuff.<eos> - It's pesticide, it's an insecticide.<eos> - Yes, I know<eos> Rita wouldn't have liked it, but if you want to get rid of them.<eos> If you know Rita wouldn't have liked it, why would you bring it?<eos> It was just an excuse to come round because of what's happened.<eos> - If you don't want it, don't use it!<eos> - I won't. Thanks.
JJ.<eos> I'm here.<eos> We're gathering some background information on Flynn that could be very helpful.<eos> Ok.<eos> Just sit tight for a minute.<eos> You ok?<eos> Hotch...<eos> What if I mess up?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You won't.
I'm not lying to you now.<eos> When you think about it, Paul did us a favor!<eos> Look!<eos> No, no!<eos> Look, look, look!<eos> We're closer than ever!<eos> Susan, get off of me.<eos> Violence isn't the answer.<eos> We can't let him get away with this.<eos> We won't.
I know this isn't gonna end well.<eos> She keeps going this way, she's gonna get herself killed or thrown in jail and you're gonna be right there with her.<eos> Dex, she's gonna bring you down.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Having breakfast?<eos> You're looking for the men who hurt you.<eos> So, what, you're spying on me now?<eos> What are you gonna do if you actually find one of these guys?<eos> Maybe...<eos> What you won't.
Move, move.<eos> FBI!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> The situation is under control.<eos> You're not in danger.<eos> You need help?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Tell... Tell... Tell Maryann...<eos> Tell Maryann...<eos> I will.
Now, she wants the Red Seals but any old shit's sound.<eos> So, I'm thinking is, I'm going to let her sniff it<eos> - while I'm up to me old tricks in her knick-knacks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Pop it back in the wrapper, nip it back round in morning.<eos> You don't have to give me the full quid back, just 50p or summat.<eos> I'm telling you now, mate, smelling it won't do fuck all.<eos> - It will.<eos> - No, it won't, mate.
Your father was a brilliant man.<eos> He was a close friend of mine.<eos> A dear friend.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why he was executed after the takeover<eos> While you fled the country.<eos> I'm going back, Hanna.<eos> I'm going to take our country back.<eos> And I promise you... you will have your revenge.<eos> We both will.
What are they up to?<eos> The bastards!<eos> It's bad to steal. Stealing is very bad.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Need to be in charge at night too?<eos> Keep out of it!<eos> It's not good to steal!<eos> Would you look at what's going on here!<eos> I'll sort it out...<eos> Will you now? Bastards!
Hello, Ben.<eos> Amy?<eos> Amy, is that really you?<eos> Yes, it's really me.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you for talking to me.<eos> Ben, I thought it was clear when I didn't return your 57 messages that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, but apparently you can't accept that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, so I'm just calling to let you know<eos> that I will talk to you at some point, but not over the phone, okay? When I get back, then we can talk face-to-face.<eos> Until then, please stop calling me.<eos> So, you will see me and talk to me when you get back?<eos> Yes, I will.
Amy?<eos> Amy, is that really you?<eos> Yes, it's really me.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you for talking to me.<eos> Ben, I thought it was clear when I didn't return your 57 messages that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, but apparently you can't accept that I don't really wanna talk to you right now, so I'm just calling to let you know<eos> that I will talk to you at some point, but not over the phone, okay?

Like Brian, that kid you've got just in case?<eos> God, it doesn't matter.<eos> It's fate.<eos> Right, I can't change anything.<eos> All I have to do is watch.<eos> I can't change anything.<eos> Hey, we just did, at the party just now.<eos> We can make our own fate.<eos> We can stop this.<eos> And we will.
So if you suck at sales,<eos> You make almost no money.<eos> I guess that's fair.<eos> - Dwight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you call all my clients at the mall<eos> And cancel all my business While using the "f" word?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> And I'm gonna do the same with all of your clients.<eos> - No, you will not.

You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Might.<eos> Might be crawling with herpes.<eos> I might have gotten it after her.<eos> You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna do that.<eos> - Then I will.
I know that, deep down inside, you are a closet nice person.<eos> So why don't you just come out of the closet?<eos> Enough!<eos> If you do not apologize, you are no longer welcome in this restaurant.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - Just watch me. - Oh, yeah.<eos> I know the law around here.<eos> What kind of syrup are you packing?<eos> - Oh. - I... I won't.
You called after I specifically told you not to?<eos> Dad, you're being ridiculous.<eos> Will you please tell him that everyone has the Internet now?<eos> Tell him it's my house, and I make the rules!<eos> It's his house.<eos> He makes the rules.<eos> Why didn't you tell him about the Internet?<eos> He's got a gun pointed at my wiener.<eos> - He's not gonna shoot you.<eos> - Oh, yes, I will.
Ugh, really?<eos> Take it from me,<eos> You show her that side of you And she will open up like a flower.<eos> 'cause there ain't nothing sexier in the world Than a secure man being honest with his woman.<eos> Baby, you coming back to bed?<eos> Now, that man Is honest as the day is long.<eos> And had he not been honest, I never would've Found out he was long.<eos> God, I love your grandma.<eos> You may not believe this now, But you'll get over this man.<eos> Yes, you will.
Hey, how's shit going over there at the kids table?<eos> It sucks.<eos> Boys, I'm sorry there's no room at the inn.<eos> No harm, no foul, Pop.<eos> I think it's just more rude of Casper to not offer his bed to guests, but whatever.<eos> Yeah, this'll be good.<eos> All right, house rules:<eos> No jerking each other off.<eos> This is my workspace and I don't want you spraying all over... - ...all my inventions.<eos> - We won't, Mr. Powers.
- We're not gonna let that boy die in vain.<eos> It's a two-step plan.<eos> First, you have to establish the segregation.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> This county has two schools.<eos> Centennial academy, which is mostly white...<eos> And cyrus garza, which is mostly black.<eos> - But the question is why.<eos> I mean, we need to prove that the county Is intentionally dividing the students.<eos> - And we will.
I know he will.<eos> Clearly...<eos> If he makes everyone feel the way you do.<eos> At least now I know why you turned me down.<eos> It's not just me that says that. No.<eos> I'm sure it isn't.<eos> Let's hope he lives that long.<eos> I don't know what we do.<eos> I could try and persuade Arthur to withdraw from the contest...<eos> He won't.
He is not coming back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Call you later.<eos> Are you gonna tell grandma and grandpa?<eos> About you getting drunk in Miami and shoplifting?<eos> Nah, that's up to you.<eos> We all have our secrets, right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - But if it ever happens again...<eos> - It won't.
There was a complication, but we were able to take care of it in surgery.<eos> You're gonna be fine as long as you quit the worms.<eos> I understand.<eos> The surgery destroyed them all.<eos> Every experiment has its ups and downs.<eos> How much time would you think before my bowel is completely healed?<eos> No, if you do this again, you could die.<eos> - Do you understand that?<eos> - Only if I make the same mistakes.<eos> I won't.
Sounded like shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounded fucking awful.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> It's fine!<eos> Fucking fix it in Pro Tools!<eos> Uhhh, I don't know there, Willy. It's uuuuuh...<eos> I'm sorry, are you being insubordinate?<eos> Do you want to tell Charles you're insubordinate?<eos> Because I fucking will!
Hell, yeah.<eos> Go, lions.<eos> All right.<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> Who wants a drink?<eos> ♪ if you ever really cared about me ♪ ♪ tell the truth, give it up ♪ ♪ you sound guilty ♪<eos> You guys out for a big night?<eos> Don't y'all wait up now.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We won't.
So why would I risk my life for a few bucks?<eos> I charge more an hour than you make in a week.<eos> As an errand boy for drug dealers and thieves.<eos> Maybe you got sick of carrying their water.<eos> You seem to have made up your mind.<eos> You gonna read me my rights?<eos> Offer me a phone call?<eos> I assume you'll want to call your lawyer.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> But you will.
What...<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Bladder trouble-- it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.<eos> I'm going to the bathroom right now.<eos> Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.<eos> Say...<eos> "Ah..."<eos> Wow!<eos> I can't wait to see it.<eos> Well, hopefully you never will.
Ha ha! P.G. Out, lover boy.<eos> What's all that?<eos> Our technical analyst ran background checks on the suspects.<eos> Oh, I could have given you that.<eos> We typically gather our own intelligence.<eos> Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.<eos> Well, how do you know they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?<eos> It's nothing personal, chief.<eos> It's just, you could have asked.<eos> Next time I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Really.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you, but I really should be getting back.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> How do you know what the killer's family is thinking?<eos> You said they'll want to apologize?<eos> They will.
And now I gots fucking welts all overs my arms!<eos> Okay well listen - And the TV news called me fat!<eos> - Okay, guys...<eos> - Yes?<eos> I'm really busy right now.<eos> In the meantime, try to tell Toki that you don't appreciate being hit.<eos> You tell him!<eos> He won't listen to us.<eos> We know he won't.<eos> No, he won't.
Someone's gotta file charges.<eos> We gotta get a case.<eos> Joe...<eos> The man's a rapist.<eos> Ain't life a bitch, shelly?<eos> we should get you a wheelchair.<eos> I walk outta here on my own steam Unless I'm in a body bag or a coma.<eos> Don't you people have somewhere to be?<eos> don't let me fall.<eos> I won't.
You saved my life, remember?<eos> So you can let me help you, or we can go another round?<eos> Man-Ape took my father and did nothing.<eos> I failed him.<eos> I know you can understand that, Captain.<eos> Please, let me do this.<eos> Okay, so that was...... a little harder than it should've been.<eos> For an uncharted African nation, they've got tech that's decades ahead of anything we've got.<eos> If HYDRA gets their hands on any of this...<eos> They won't.
That wasn't the killer.<eos> That was the police, and now they probably think you're the killer.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> How so? Did I tell you to go out there in the middle of the night?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Uh, I'll go to the police.<eos> I'll explain things to them. They'll see it's a misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, sure, they will.
Figure of speech.<eos> What's the matter with you this morning?<eos> Two busboys and a waiter called in sick, So I had to walk here in the freezing rain Because my bicycle was stolen.<eos> You want us to file a report?<eos> We might be able to find it.<eos> If you're going to play detective, I'd prefer you find my car.<eos> Which was stolen a year ago and the reason I'm riding a bicycle in the first place.<eos> We'll have two breakfast specials.<eos> You'll have whatever I bring you and you'll like it.<eos> Yes, we will.
No.<eos> No-one does.<eos> It's... lonely... ..to...be more powerful than any man you know and have to live like a shadow.<eos> To...be special and have to pretend you're a fool.<eos> I know how it feels.<eos> I understand.<eos> Then you understand why I have to fight.<eos> If Uther is killed, so what?<eos> How many of our kind have died at his hands?<eos> How many more will?
What do we do now?<eos> Father, we have to hurry. SHOUTING<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please, Father, now isn't the time.<eos> BELLS RING OUT What the hell are those two doing?<eos> If we're to go down, we'll go down fighting.<eos> For the love of Camelot!<eos> I have a feeling I won't be seeing you again.<eos> No.<eos> You won't. Oferswinge!
Look, just give us a minute.<eos> Stop panicking.<eos> Of course I'm panicking!<eos> Just stop panicking.<eos> What do you expect? ! Calm down!<eos> Oi, you're on the camera.<eos> Get over here.<eos> I couldn't handle 18 months, so no way can I do 18 fucking years.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> And you won't either.
... For serious relationship. "<eos> Thevainqueencalledourprincethedrearytype.<eos> Buthowcanhebegloomy?<eos> Onthecontrary , he's cheerful and so energetic.<eos> One-two- andgoingontheroad.<eos> Butwhatmovedhis headabit - it is so for a reason!<eos> Withlove,aman goestomarry !<eos> I will not, dear Prince!<eos> As you wish, prince, I do not let you go!<eos> I will not!
The fuck are you talking about?<eos> All I want is a blow job.<eos> That's it.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just get down on your knees.<eos> Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...<eos> First, you get down on your knees, all right? All right?<eos> I want to go back to my cell.<eos> You will soon enough.
Good.<eos> It's when you don't that you need to start being scared.<eos> Talk to me for a second.<eos> Now, I'm not mad at you, Zoona.<eos> You've done a lot of good things for this province.<eos> But right now, we really need your help.<eos> You need to tell us where they are,<eos> what they want.<eos> If you tell us that, he's gonna let you live.<eos> No, he won't.
I'm gonna pull out. You gonna get out, and you go open the gate.<eos> Why I got to open the gate?<eos> What?<eos> Because you gonna open the gate.<eos> Next time we trapped in a garage with a damn near seven-foot dead guy... and we're in your car, you can drive.<eos> But until then, you the gate-opener motherfucker.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Thought that's where you put it.<eos> - How's that gonna help us?<eos> - It won't.
look! So many people have gathered here!<eos> For me... and for you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Good work, everyone!<eos> Does anyone need water?<eos> Does anyone need water?<eos> Does nobody want to sing?<eos> Eh?<eos> Nobody?<eos> I will.
I can't justify opening up a seven-year-old out-of-state kidnapping.<eos> - We have to try!<eos> - I won't.<eos> Paradise is my last stop, Rose.<eos> There's nowhere to go from here.<eos> Then I'm going to do it.<eos> On my own time.<eos> - I can't stop you.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - But I won't.
Yeah, that's good but... I don't know the point of it.<eos> I mean, my face has cleared up but everything else feels the same.<eos> Well you have to stick with it.<eos> Do you like the people in your group?<eos> They're ok.<eos> This one girl, she...<eos> You know, I hope you're taking this seriously.<eos> I mean that I hope you are trying with all your might.<eos> I cannot lose you to this.<eos> You won't.
Never.<eos> I have counseled obedience and I have helped wives find harmony with their husbands.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I want you to find Rhonda and bring her to me.<eos> I'm not your errand boy.<eos> If I can't find her and convince her to renounce the lies she speaks against me, I will put your wives and children on the stand to testify to her credibility, and everything that you're trying to hide about your life will come tumbling out in open court.<eos> Don't you dare try to drag my family into this.<eos> I am an innocent man defending himself.<eos> You come at me, I will do everything in my power to see you locked up for the rest of your life.<eos> No, you won't.
Bullshit.<eos> Clear.<eos> Wait.<eos> I've gotta find her.<eos> Trust me, this won't turn out well for either one of you.<eos> I love her.<eos> I know.<eos> Tell her...<eos> Tell her that I'm sorry I kept her a secret.<eos> I will.
I still can't believe this happened.<eos> I thought they were gonna kill all of us.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> It's over... and we're safe... thanks to a lot of brave people.<eos> Excuse me, Madam President, the vice president is on a secure line.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Did you mean what you said ... about putting the past behind us?<eos> Of course I meant it.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
I heard about Jack.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm still debriefing him but I brought a full description of the canisters.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, get this out to the field agents.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Hard to tell.<eos> Larry, so many people have died today.<eos> We cannot let their deaths be for nothing.<eos> We won't.
The staging team's ready and waiting on us.<eos> This'll be uploaded in two minutes.<eos> Good.<eos> Jibraan... we're getting ready to move out.<eos> I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother.<eos> Tell him what we discussed.<eos> Go ahead and wake him up.<eos> Please, I can't do this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
What do you mean?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Agent Walker, are you still there?<eos> I'm not...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> We could not have gotten this far if it wasn't for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> No one would blame you if this was just too much for you to handle.<eos> Maybe you should get out.<eos> Maybe I will.
What?<eos> How long have you known about this?<eos> They're not going to get anything out of him.<eos> He's unconscious in the hospital.<eos> There was a crash during a chase.<eos> Listen, the FBI recovered that database you told me about, the list of names.<eos> I'm in the process of deleting it.<eos> I'm going to erase every trace of it.<eos> I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list.<eos> They won't.
And what of Judge Jeffreys?<eos> Captured trying to follow him.<eos> Fell ill, died in the Tower.<eos> So, I've no enemies left in England.<eos> Thank God my father's lived to see this day.<eos> Robinson.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> I promised him.<eos> I promised him he'd see me again.<eos> And he will, but not in this world.
- Love Lays Dying?<eos> Yeah, I think I'll be all right.<eos> Sounds like a chickflick. But, uh, I'll have everything packed by the time you get home.<eos> Amsterdam, here we come.<eos> I can't believe we're actually going.<eos> Um, heh... You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.<eos> speaking of, she's walking up right now.<eos> I'm gonna run, okay?<eos> - Tell her I said hi.<eos> - I will.
- I love you, dude.<eos> - I love you, Bro Montana.<eos> - I love you, holmes.<eos> - I love you, Broseph Goebbels.<eos> - Love you, muchacha.<eos> - I love you, Tycho Brohe.<eos> Okay. Okay. Right.<eos> Let's continue here.<eos> - I so wanna marry you.<eos> - You will.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe not such a strong person.<eos> Please stop.<eos> And you know what the worst of it is?<eos> There is nothing we can do about it.<eos> Because she is gone.<eos> And this family can't be fixed.<eos> And that is it.<eos> And what if one of us freaks out like that?<eos> We won't.
Yes, he is.<eos> Anyway, I can't. Sorry.<eos> I have to tell you you're letting down a child.<eos> A small person who strangely hero-worships you.<eos> I am shocked, Luke.<eos> Shocked and saddened.<eos> You can bring him to play at the flat.<eos> And what about your Xbox?<eos> No, he'll trash it.<eos> He won't.
I know what you want, Ruby.<eos> But it's not going to happen.<eos> You can't just smite your way into Luke's heart.<eos> The sooner you realise that, the better.<eos> I've never seen Galvin so angry.<eos> I mean, it's not like he's a relaxed kind of guy.<eos> I suppose this is different.<eos> You're not old enough to have enemies, Luke.<eos> Not...real ones.<eos> But you will, one day.
You know sometimes, Mina, you love to create problems.<eos> I'm going after him and I'm going to kill him.<eos> I'm not trying to stop you, just be patient.<eos> We need more time.<eos> We have no more time.<eos> OK, I want you to stay here with Mina.<eos> When I get back, we'll think of a better plan.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> He'll come.<eos> No, he won't.
Make sure you watch your step as you enter the aquarium.<eos> We did it, Gus.<eos> A year of planning's finally paid off.<eos> Don't you think we should wait until they get a little further away?<eos> No. We have to move now.<eos> We've got 10 minutes to find a dolphin, feed it, then ride it.<eos> Plus, my dad being sick and not being able to chaperone, the fates are with us.<eos> It's a perfect storm.<eos> I don't want to miss the otters.<eos> No, we won't. Um...
No fair.<eos> Your parts are much bigger than mine.<eos> I'm older, so live with it.<eos> Aunty, Lamis won't let me leave this part of the room.<eos> I can't even get to the door!<eos> Is it true, Lamis?<eos> - No, I was just kidding. God!<eos> - No, she's not.<eos> She's gonna put the tape back there when you leave.<eos> No, she won't.
From now on, anyways.<eos> Wow.<eos> You don't know where to get such a car.<eos> I know someone. You only have to give him a call.<eos> He can get you any spotter you want.<eos> You don't get it, do you, man?<eos> I want to change my life, bro.<eos> No more shit... just a good life.<eos> Well, I hope it works out for you.<eos> It will.
I promise. This guy will get his 15 minutes of fame and then bam, he ain't shit no more.<eos> They'll find someone else to talk about.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> You on board?<eos> You feeling better now? Huh?<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> What?<eos> I heard something. - What?<eos> - Just go check it out.<eos> - I will, in a sec.
The drug. It's not being sold, Topher.<eos> The effects are spreading.<eos> Mr. Dominic is exhibiting erratic behavior.<eos> (nervous laugh) He didn't take any.<eos> There's no way Dom would consciously try and have fun.<eos> It could be airborne.<eos> We'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus. Beyond even.<eos> Exposure to a patient, whether viral, or through touch... that spreads more slowly, but pretty soon, that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs.<eos> Well, we need to know what it is.<eos> Yes, well, we will...
You sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, fine. Just got banged up a bit, you know.<eos> Don't start being all concerned, now.<eos> It doesn't suit ya.<eos> Well, listen, you may have got banged up, but I'd say it was worth it.<eos> - Great work.<eos> I probably should have stayed home.<eos> I'm not much in the mood for socializing.<eos> You should go and talk to Diane.<eos> I will.
I remember it.<eos> Just like Niles remembered killing Conor.<eos> Maybe his memories weren't real, and neither are yours.<eos> You said that magic had to be behind all this.<eos> Well, now I'm starting to agree.<eos> We need to go find that sorcerer.<eos> Well, I hope you're right.<eos> 'Cause right now, I don't trust myself.<eos> What if I do something like that again?<eos> You won't.
We need to find some food.<eos> My father used to give this to me when I was a baby.<eos> There you go.<eos> I thought you might like that.<eos> Richard,what are we gonna do with him?<eos> Well,I was thinking.<eos> Maybe we can take him to the Valley of Thandor.<eos> The duty of the Sisters of the Light is to protect the children at Thandor.<eos> They'd never take in a male Confessor.<eos> No one will.
Are you saying that he's dead?<eos> No. He's not saying that he's dead.<eos> You're not saying that, are you?<eos> We were in the walls, and she attacked.<eos> And I couldn't get to him in time.<eos> Uncle ted is dead?<eos> I shouldn't have left him alone.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> We'll find him, suse.<eos> We will.
Where are you?<eos> We haven't made the arrest yet.<eos> You're not coming home?<eos> Honey, I can't.<eos> I... I am so sorry.<eos> Look, I would've called you earlier, but I kept hoping we'd be done.<eos> We're probably gonna be here all night.<eos> You're upset. I can tell you're upset.<eos> Just remember this the next time you're mad at me 'cause I have to put my work first.<eos> I will.
Here's the thing.<eos> I can't pay you today.<eos> But I can pay you this week, all right?<eos> Seventeen fifty?<eos> We'll make it 1,750, for, like, you know, interest.<eos> - I thought your word was your bond.<eos> - It totally is.<eos> Definitely.<eos> I just don't have the money at this particular moment.<eos> But I will, soon.
It can swallow me again.<eos> We don't belong here, do we?<eos> - So? Go home.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Police want to talk to me.<eos> - About what?<eos> She came from nowhere. Drunk.<eos> - They should talk to her, not me.<eos> - Tell them that.<eos> I will.
Stevens is streaming<eos> A live video message from the plant.<eos> I will put it on-screen. Video message?<eos> To who?<eos> Everyone.<eos> The pentagon refused to build my design, They called it excessive and unnecessary.<eos> This is a weapon that would eliminate war.<eos> If you wanted Bin Laden dead, Just push in the coordinates and it was done.<eos> But you see nobody listens Unless something horrible happens.<eos> And now, once again, It will.
We stayed behind on Pegasus with the civilian fleet. You thought you'd never see him again.<eos> That easy to read, huh?<eos> Just to me.<eos> There were some good times for us, weren't there, on Pegasus?<eos> Yeah. I remember what you told me.<eos> We had to keep the human race going.<eos> And you did.<eos> No, we did.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you, Dee.<eos> You will this time too.
I'm going back to the university to teach and do some research.<eos> It's where I belong.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And good luck to you too, Captain.<eos> Have a safe trip out there, Chief.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
- Correct!<eos> I mean...<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> Jesus.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Ok!<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't I go to the village and convince Grandpa to transfer all the property on my name before the wedding.<eos> Has my father-in-law ever listened to anyone that he will listen to you?<eos> He won't.
Pass that thing here.<eos> Thing? It's a fucking gun, Ryan.<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> It's none of your fucking business.<eos> This is my house! It is my fucking business!<eos> Eric, you don't know what's going on. Just give it to me.<eos> Well, you better fucking tell me then.<eos> If I don't get that to him, yeah? I'm in the shit. We all are.<eos> You better go and tell him to fuck off.<eos> Or I will, all right?
I'm never gonna use it.<eos> If you're sure. This is everything.<eos> Where's my laptop?<eos> Up stairs in the bedroom with your suitcase.<eos> Is this enough food for one week? Plenty.<eos> I don't eat much when I'm working.<eos> I'll unpack the rest.<eos> Come on, let's go before you miss your flight.<eos> You'd better call me.<eos> Oh, of course I will.
- I'm trying.<eos> - Today should help take your mind off it.<eos> I don't want the family to know I'm going to Latnok.<eos> I don't want to upset Nicole.<eos> - Then don't go.<eos> - I've made a deal.<eos> And I've seen what they're capable of.<eos> If I don't go today, it won't be the end of it.<eos> - So you won't say anything?<eos> - I won't.
But if that blonde little bimbo hurts you...<eos> Just say the word and we'll crush her.<eos> Don't worry. I'm OK.<eos> I never could get used to Kyle seeing through me all the time,<eos> - but with two of you, I guess now I'll have to.<eos> - I guess.<eos> I know you had to relive something today, Jessi.<eos> Something that you saw that was really bad.<eos> You don't have to tell me about it.<eos> - I will.
- How?<eos> Something to do with her disappearance.<eos> Recall your experiences from that night and examine your memories.<eos> It's working.<eos> I see something.<eos> He killed her!<eos> She's dead!<eos> My mother is dead.<eos> We need to find out why he did it.<eos> We will.
-Kily, Pirjo...<eos> -That's enough!<eos> We're arriving.<eos> There seems to be action.<eos> ...fuckin' great...<eos> Take it all.<eos> Battering rams, flares.<eos> Everything.<eos> Sir, who got the battering ram?<eos> -I will.
Fighting without a commando unit is...<eos> Sudhendhu. - Yes.<eos> Give them whatever they want.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The hostages should be saved within 24 hours.<eos> Raid all the Naxal villages.<eos> Shoot at sight, if need be.<eos> That scoundrel burnt so many Naxal villages.<eos> The villagers will lose faith in us.<eos> No, they won't.
It was a bar we go to sometimes.<eos> Strip club.<eos> My wife doesn't know.<eos> Just please don't judge me.<eos> I'm not judging you.<eos> (GROANS) What?<eos> He's dead, he can't feel this.<eos> I wonder if they sell cars here with those seats that warm your ass.<eos> Well, why don't you ask him?<eos> Maybe I will.
Well, remember Kurt?<eos> Your ex-boyfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.<eos> - What?<eos> - He was drunk.<eos> I would hope so.<eos> Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.<eos> Did he pay you back?<eos> No, but he will.
vin, don't say a word.<eos> Are you talking to my client without his lawyer being present?<eos> Now you know better than that.<eos> If Mr. Sheridan is in fact your client, then we have a conflict of interest, don't we?<eos> I know the law, Lieutenant.<eos> Mr. Reyes has been notified.<eos> And that's my only legal obligation.<eos> Yes, and we both know Mr. Reyes is innocent, don't we?<eos> Do you have evidence to prove that Mr. Sheridan had any involvement?<eos> I will.
I've been trying for so long.<eos> But nothing gets through to them.<eos> Courtney's still alive isn't she?<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> You can't let that happen.<eos> Look,what they did to you...<eos> It was...<eos> Awful.<eos> But hurting Courtney is not gonna fix any of this.<eos> Yes,it will.
It's not your fault.<eos> You didn't leave her.<eos> You didn't leave her alone.<eos> She'll never be alone.<eos> Mom, there it is again.<eos> The light.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Tell Lucy we're sorry.<eos> Tell them all we love them very much.<eos> I will.
Why you singling me out?<eos> Because you created a fake identity, went along with a plan to put that fake person onto this jury.<eos> And that much we can prove. That's a serious felony.<eos> Talking to you doesn't get me anything.<eos> Okay, if you've got nothing to say to us, we'll just put you back out on the street, and make sure everybody knows you were in here.<eos> You can go hang out with your buddy Robert Logan.<eos> Oh, actually, you can't. He's dead.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> I don't want to end up like Logan.<eos> You won't.
That's why we'll save him for last.<eos> Well, I'm glad you've got my back.<eos> I'm glad to have it.<eos> Especially when it looks like that.<eos> Oh, that sounds perfect, Colby.<eos> Uh-huh, thanks. It's almost as if we planned it that way.<eos> All right, take it easy.<eos> So, Liz met with the second dealer.<eos> He's in. I really think this plan's gonna work.<eos> - Of course it will.
Nine? Where would you meet a nine-year-old girl?<eos> We're in the same math class.<eos> Is, uh... Is she one of those advanced students?<eos> Sadly no.<eos> But she does help me with my homework.<eos> Hey, Berta.<eos> Chelsea's not feeling well.<eos> Could you make her tea and English muffin?<eos> Sure, I could.<eos> But you won't.
Dougie still can't remember a thing.<eos> Bob? Well...<eos> He's in a bit of a state.<eos> Craven and Douglas knew shots had been fired, knew the SPG are on their way, and still they go charging in there?<eos> 'Strange.'<eos> Hero cops, remember?<eos> It doesn't quite add up, does it?<eos> It's your investigation, Hunter.<eos> I want to talk to them.<eos> And you will, but not just yet.
Martin Laws helped me.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> Why didn't you come to me?<eos> I want to know what the fuck you're going to do about this mess!<eos> Let us worry about that, yeah?<eos> You just keep it together, lad.<eos> I am not going to be the fucking goat!<eos> There's always a goat. It ain't gonna be me.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> Fucking right, it won't.

Yeah. I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone.<eos> It's not.<eos> The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.<eos> I knew you wrote the book.<eos> I liked it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You're a good writer.<eos> I think you should keep writing.<eos> Thanks, Andrew.<eos> I will.
Oh, thank god!<eos> we've been locked in here all night.<eos> Really?<eos> good thing I came by to check the rat traps then.<eos> Ugh! I'm glad I forgot about those until now.<eos> Uh, mayer?<eos> I, uh, would appreciate it If you wouldn't talk about what we talked about.<eos> I wasn't planning to.<eos> Good, because I'll deny it if you do.<eos> I won't.
Okay, you know the problems they're having at his school.<eos> And now with all the budget cutbacks...<eos> I mean, this place is fabulous.<eos> I'm not saying it's not.<eos> I'd kill to send him there.<eos> I just can't swing it.<eos> We've got to do something.<eos> My editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves.<eos> Could you pick up some extra shifts?<eos> Oh, yeah, I will.
The environmental impact studies that you're basing your statements on don't tell the whole story, not by a long shot.<eos> What about the flash point?<eos> Yeah, what about the flash point?<eos> Sounds hot. Is there any way that you could push the flash point up?<eos> Yeah, can you push it up a bit, Pat?<eos> When something goes wrong, this stuff burns like crazy, and I'm not going to have an uncontrollable blaze at the foot of Manattan.<eos> Yeah, a blaze to the foot would be bad.<eos> Charles, my parents are hosting a little soiree at their place tomorrow night for investors, potential partners.<eos> We would love it if you two could come.<eos> Well, then, maybe we will.
- Stop it!<eos> Look... if you don't settle down your blood pressure's gonna rise and you're gonna start contracting.<eos> Sorry, because I don't know you, but you really need to shut up, OK?<eos> All right, look. There.<eos> Look, there's your son's face.<eos> [Alex] That's what you need to hold on to for the next couple of hours, OK?<eos> is that a tumor?<eos> He's gonna need more aggressive treatment.<eos> - He'll have to tell his daughter now.<eos> - He won't.
The dart does not penetrate, adheres to the animal skin.<eos> And we will track GPS with this reaching 10 km.<eos> We put one of these in Our "boy"... sorry, "Girl" and she should lead us directly to her family.<eos> So the question is: how find the creature and mark it?<eos> With something never mentioned in Revelation.<eos> Let's get this thing out.<eos> I never thought it would come day I would have to do something.<eos> Could you give me coverage?<eos> - I never used it in my life.<eos> I will.
Sir Roger of Gisborne!<eos> Now, to celebrate those who have returned and to honour those who have not, I want you to join me in enjoying something the men have brought back from their travels.<eos> The Fire Wheel will light our skies to show us that our darkest days are now behind us.<eos> Now, I need two strong men to lift the wheel, and the two best archers in the county.<eos> Robin, will you help me?<eos> And Guy?<eos> Father, may I?<eos> - Robin...<eos> - I want to make the shot.<eos> And you will, but not because of the bow.
What?<eos> Do you think they'll want a little brother or a sister?<eos> You've been spying on us?<eos> I've been looking for an opportunity to get what I deserve - lands of my own!<eos> You will give me yours, lady, unless you want everyone to know your little secret.<eos> Very well.<eos> Go to Nottingham, have the deeds drawn up.<eos> Thank you, my lord.<eos> Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.<eos> And they will.
You men with me!<eos> I will come back to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Then Arathorn, son of Arador,<eos> Lord of the Dúnedain, led his people in a great and valiant onslaught, and the servants of the Enemy quailed.<eos> Arathorn, wait!<eos> Now the line of Kings ends!<eos> The line is not broken. There is still hope!<eos> They will return, Gilraen.<eos> They will.
It's more interesting, isn't it?<eos> Depending on the project, if both the mosque and the parking... the larger space will be the parking and the smallest the mosque.<eos> There's nothing I can do in this case.<eos> Our work has been clear from the beginning, remember?<eos> My father said to you might construct a Great Mosque and left to believers... the decision on the parking lot.<eos> In this village it is impossible.<eos> - How is your father?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Please, give him my regards.<eos> - I will.
He knew he was garbage.<eos> He wanted to go in there.<eos> I... I barely did anything.<eos> You don't... You don't think you've done anything wrong?<eos> No, I do.<eos> Captain Industry should be behind bars, but now I'm here.<eos> Arthur, why is it so important that you capture Captain Industry?<eos> He killed my mother.<eos> When will I see Mommy again?<eos> You won't.
Bye.<eos> Are you off, baby?<eos> I'm studying at Quentin's.<eos> I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Is that him?<eos> Why not my place?<eos> It's too small.<eos> We'll disturb you if you want to watch TV.<eos> No, you won't.
Our money!<eos> Shell it up!<eos> You are a dirty thief!<eos> - Come on, let them reason<eos> - I would pay them, if I were you...<eos> - Just a second, listen to me!<eos> - They are savages!<eos> They will kill me. They want their expenses immediately!<eos> - They will wait<eos> - No, no, no they won't!
It's killing my dog!<eos> He's got my neck!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> My dog is dead!<eos> Maybe that's why he was tied up.<eos> Meg, will you take one of these and pass it down, please?<eos> What's this? I'm starting a new advocacy group.<eos> The quahog animal equal rights league.<eos> Our first meeting is tomorrow night, And I'd really appreciate it if you guys Would come and show your support.<eos> Well, of course we will, Brian.
I Iike it.<eos> Each envelope contains a unit of hope.<eos> More envelopes, more hope.<eos> More envelopes, more hopes denied.<eos> Some of us hold on to hope. Boyden.<eos> KIotz.<eos> Wider path, please.<eos> The King approaches.<eos> You're never going to tell her you love her.<eos> I will. When?
Why don't we just go to bed, and pretend that we have neither kids nor kingdoms to consider?<eos> You have an early morning of judgment. (SIGHS)<eos> Well, I'm not in the mood to judge.<eos> Well, justice is indifferent to your moods.<eos> Oh, as is my own wife, apparently.<eos> After all I've done, to recant now?<eos> The King can't forgive you if you don't.<eos> ETHAN: I don't want his forgiveness.<eos> I want him to change his mind.<eos> He won't on the land.
Well, young wives have nothing to fear from old wives' tales.<eos> They look at her and laugh.<eos> You had an eye on greatness and the grip to hold it, and you'd let a quarrel with me pair you to a laughingstock.<eos> You had a more interesting weakness than spite.<eos> KATRINA: Hmm. Did I lose more weight?<eos> It just drops off me when I'm happy.<eos> You blackmailed him into this.<eos> Jack accepted my proposal freely, happily, once he saw the damage it would do you.<eos> It will never happen.<eos> Of course, it will.
Hey, I could throw one on for you.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I told you not to see him.<eos> I just wanted David to know he still has our support.<eos> Well, he doesn't.<eos> I'm just trying to protect you from what could happen to him.<eos> We have evidence that the case against him is a lie.<eos> If I take the stand, I can provide an alibi that proves his innocence.<eos> I will not have brother cross-examine sister, tear her apart, destroy her credibility.<eos> Because I will.
If it was my son, I'd come.<eos> Arlene, we need to talk about Will. L...<eos> No.<eos> I told you no.<eos> No vaccinations.<eos> I don't think you can risk putting Will - through what Michael's going through.<eos> - I can't risk putting Will through what Jeffrey's gone through.<eos> I lost one child to autism.<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> - Arlene, you won't...
Jesus is for them not only Son of God and the Saviour, but also Rabbi.<eos> Who?<eos> The teacher.<eos> - The best teacher!<eos> - Well, yes, this yes!<eos> Whom would the Poles. would listen to more than the best teacher?<eos> We aren't so nad've to believe that the death rate. will drop by the mentioned 95 per cent.<eos> But the number of people saved will be immense.<eos> Unless the Polish Parliament turn their backs on Jesus.<eos> They won't, Father Editor, they won't!
- Yeah, sure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> No no, I'm grand.<eos> Thanks. I'm starving.<eos> Let's see what we have here.<eos> You'll have to help me.<eos> There's no way I'm dragging all this cheese and jam back to London.<eos> Will you have some red wine or a drop of- what is this- whisky?<eos> No, I won't, thanks.
Can you help me out?<eos> Hurry! They're coming!<eos> - Where?<eos> - Hurry!<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - If they get us, it's your fault.<eos> - You never listen to me.<eos> - I always listen to you.<eos> - Don't... Don't let them get us, okay?<eos> - I won't. I won't.
I'm not doing this with you, Olivia.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> You did it.<eos> What was that?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Farnsworth.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
She in't from nearby.<eos> But prettier than a penny to a poor man's eyes.<eos> Does she have a name?<eos> As lovely as her face.<eos> Rose. Twister... stop this.<eos> That's all right, Alf.<eos> It's my own fault for supposing I have a right to know your affairs.<eos> I'm glad for you.<eos> Truly. I hope I can meet Rose sometime soon.<eos> Oh, you will.
And it was exhausting!<eos> I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago!<eos> That is not true.<eos> It's not true?<eos> So you're calling Dr. Harris a liar?<eos> Yes. I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.<eos> How about that?<eos> You call him!<eos> You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.<eos> Yes. Yes. I will.
And we've put a lot of time, resources, so, no, I do not accept it.<eos> You just can't walk away.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> You cashed the advance.<eos> I'll pay it back.<eos> And you'll be talking to our lawyers, all ten of them.<eos> Fine. Fine. You go ahead and do whatever you u want, but it's not gonna get a book out of me!<eos> Because... I give up.<eos> I can't... I can't go back there.<eos> And I won't.
That's just it.<eos> The baby is fine.<eos> But you, Naomi, we all want to change the baby. To a him. Into something that he's not.<eos> So you just want to leave him a freak.<eos> - He's not a freak.<eos> - Well, he is if they don't do the surgery.<eos> Please, you've gotta do this.<eos> Give us our son.<eos> I can't. I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
- Why me?<eos> I don't trust anybody else.<eos> Well, you shouldn't trust me either.<eos> Wh... They didn't catch you?<eos> I took a sedative to relax my face.<eos> I don't believe this. You gotta tell them.<eos> It's the only chance you have of not getting fired.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> They won't find out.<eos> Lightman will.
-ln the fridge.<eos> -There's nothing here.<eos> Hello.. tomato ketchup..<eos> Have you counted this?<eos> Have you?<eos> Hello..<eos> Come on!<eos> Now I have to start all over again.<eos> What if Kewal calls AGM?<eos> No he won't.
Yes. Only that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I misunderstood?<eos> Yes, Dorcas.<eos> And I shall prove it to you here and now.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Marry me, Dorcas.<eos> Don't say a word now.<eos> I don't have the necessary ring.<eos> But I will, within the hour.
It's basic instinct.<eos> A cook who loves cooking will never do that.<eos> Have some tea please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Master Sum left.<eos> We have no cook now.<eos> I just know following cook book.<eos> And my sister doesn't want to be a cook, too.<eos> If this goes on, our restaurant... It will be closed sooner or later.<eos> And this family business will...
Just keep heading east.<eos> No, no, no, you have to come with us.<eos> Not with Wakefield still out there.<eos> Then we all stay.<eos> I mean, what about Trish?<eos> I can't just leave her here. Your priority is to get your little girl off this island.<eos> Now, Shea, crank that sucker.<eos> Thank you...<eos> and tell Trish that I...<eos> I will.
Wasn't part of the plan.<eos> They know that somebody let Wakefield out of his jail cell.<eos> You're setting Jimmy up as Wakefield's accomplice?<eos> I'm doing it for you.<eos> For us.<eos> So that no one will come looking for us.<eos> So that we can live our lives together.<eos> Jimmy will sign a confession.<eos> No, he'll never do it.<eos> No. Yes, he will.

Don't you worry about Eric.<eos> We'll do the job and go home.<eos> A deal's a deal.<eos> Sookie, you know what he's like.<eos> What's it to him to break a contract with a girl?<eos> A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
Chloe would have done that for anyone.<eos> She believes in second chances.<eos> She doesn't actually have feelings for you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of what i am?<eos> I didn't want this, clark.<eos> I even killed myself to try to escape this life, but the darkness... it doesn't come out when chloe's around.<eos> She makes me... human.<eos> What happens when that changes?<eos> It won't.
Yeah.<eos> I think they were ready to get married and have a baby on their second date.<eos> I think they did.<eos> I really hate that I'm gonna miss Jamie getting bigger.<eos> By the time I come home to visit he'll already be walking and talking.<eos> - Not with Nathan and Haley. He'll be reading and dribbling first.<eos> They are gonna be amazing parents.<eos> And you are gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> You should have that one day.<eos> And you will.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't!<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> I promise, okay? They're gonna welcome us on Gemenon...<eos> It's not like it is here on Caprica.<eos> We'll have a whole new family.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew she'd back out.<eos> She won't tell anyone before we're off-world.<eos> She won't.
Thanks for stopping me back there.<eos> The store doesn't need any more trouble than it's already got.<eos> What is it, sir?<eos> Rumors mostly.<eos> There's been some talk about a store in the area closing.<eos> People being fired-- Times are tough.<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
- There's a point?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> People get hurt.<eos> Some get saved.<eos> A lot die.<eos> And it happens all over again.<eos> I should not have come into work today.<eos> You can't pick the days, Nancy, or what happens in them.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
I'm gonna separate Davis from the beast... and use this crystal to send Doomsday to the Phantom Zone.<eos> Spare me the Kryptonian mumbo jumbo.<eos> You have to bend the rules on this one.<eos> When I took Davis to the fortress, you stopped me from sending him away.<eos> You knew he was worth saving.<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> - No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through, but there's still a side of Davis that's human.<eos> So, then what if the plan fails?<eos> It won't.
You know, someday, weeks will go by, maybe even years, it won't even cross our minds.<eos> We'll come home, and we'll talk about work.<eos> And what we want for dinner... movies.<eos> Nursery schools.<eos> It's going to be great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, all we got to do is survive.<eos> We will.
I've been working.<eos> Throughout the night, actually, trying to find out why our power reserves are so low.<eos> I'm quite concerned, and so should you be.<eos> Okay, well, how bad is it?<eos> I haven't been able to access any of the main systems yet, so I don't know.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.<eos> Get the information we need and make some informed decisions, and we report...<eos> Could you please stop people running around activating every bloody system they can get their hands on?<eos> I will.
You will someday.<eos> I'll probably do like a michael douglas thing, ya know?<eos> Grab some young hottie.<eos> Ah, so you're an actor.<eos> But not really a michael douglas type.<eos> I'm more of a colin farrell, ya know?<eos> Dangerous, yet vulnerable.<eos> Well, if doesn't work out-- uh, it'll work out.<eos> But if it doesn'T.<eos> It will.
So if someone spiked Castigan's pool,they would've had to do it last night.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> At a movie.<eos> With my girlfriend.<eos> You know we're going to have to check with her,right?<eos> You might want to call your clients,too. Tell them they're gonna have to clean their own pools today.<eos> We gotta take your truck.<eos> Yeah,right.<eos> You guys do whatever you got to do.<eos> We will.
And unless you pledge your trust to me, dear Rudolph... that troll will ensured you never get anywhere near the throne of our beloved country.<eos> So what are you going to do now?<eos> - Do?<eos> - Well, you can't stay here anymore.<eos> They'll just send more men to kill you.<eos> Do you've somewhere else you can hide?<eos> I have a shelter up between the hills.<eos> Yes... stay there hidden until I come back.<eos> - You'll never come back.<eos> - Of course I will.
I'll give you first bite.<eos> - I am not hungry.<eos> - Oh, come now.<eos> As I recall, your appetite was always insatiable.<eos> This human act you do for your girlfriend is charming and all but we both know better.<eos> Don't we?<eos> - Please.<eos> I don't wanna die.<eos> - Let him go.<eos> I will.
Sorry.<eos> What about your folks?<eos> Colorado Springs.<eos> They own a bookstore called Bering Sons.<eos> How many brothers?<eos> No brothers.<eos> Just me. My dad thought the "and Sons" sounded classier.<eos> Well, he must be proud of you.<eos> Well, did protecting the President of the United States turn him around?<eos> Yeah. This won't.
Well, it can't take priority over homicide.<eos> Perhaps Captain Rehder would like to tell mr. Parsall's family that...<eos> Chief Johnson is trying to combine my Officer-involved shooting - when they are clearly...<eos> - Are you interrupting me?<eos> - Are you interrupting...<eos> - I must go first!<eos> My investigation must go first!<eos> These attempts to pull rank are embarrassing, unacceptable, and potentially an obstruction of justice.<eos> I've a federally mandated responsibility to determine why an LAPD Officer discharged his weapon, which supersedes Chief Johnson's objections, as well as yours, sir, - if it comes to that.<eos> - It won't.
No.<eos> Let them kill us both.<eos> They won't do that.<eos> They need one of us.<eos> We should both live.<eos> You know they won't let that happen.<eos> If they cancel you...<eos> I won't want to live.<eos> I'll step in front of the first bullet_BAR_shot at me.<eos> No, you won't.
This is not the new 90210 premiere.<eos> This is Scorsese.<eos> I am pumped indeed!<eos> Oh, a little heads up - the wife's probably not going to come.<eos> What? Why not?<eos> This is a couples thing.<eos> My wife is very excited.<eos> - As was I. - What's really going on with you?<eos> - What if your wife doesn't like Marlo?<eos> - Of course she will!
I'm sorry she's not a coke-snorting teen idol or a big black rapist!<eos> - Not everyone can have class up the ass.<eos> - No ass, just class.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I could take the stubbornness, really I could, and the substance abuse, and the lateness and the "cooler than school and all the rest of us" ne'er-do-well attitude, but the thing that absolutely got me was the unwarranted advice<eos> about my biological clock.<eos> But, you know, he's fully qualified to do that, because he has such a deep understanding of womanhood.<eos> Shouldn't you be defending me?<eos> Talking up my good points?<eos> Well, yeah, I will later.
Do you understand?<eos> Now, tell Sam the truth.<eos> I'm sorry, Sam.<eos> Sorry's not gonna bring me back, bunny.<eos> I'm sorry because you made the mistake.<eos> - Not me. - You were late.<eos> You were early.<eos> The target made you, and you got yourself killed.<eos> I love you, Sam.<eos> I always will.
Six-Adam-43, woman screaming at 2245 Van Ness.<eos> Penal code 2, incident 1349-RD671.<eos> I also got cactus too.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Every day for 15 years.<eos> - Ma'am, what's the problem? - They're out of chicken nuggets.<eos> I've eaten them every day for 15 years.<eos> You called 911 because they're out of chicken nuggets?<eos> - What am I supposed to do? - I don't know. But right now you need to bring it down.<eos> - No, I won't.
And teacher.<eos> You're a doer, remember?<eos> You know exactly what you have to do.<eos> (knock on door) Come in.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You can cut into my brain again.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can do it, but...<eos> I don't want to end up a vegetable.<eos> Izzie, you won't.
Look at that.<eos> Wetbacks with a baby.<eos> Probably got nine more at home.<eos> Whole town's gone brown, man.<eos> Police! Don't move!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Drop to the ground with your hands up!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Take another step, and I'll blow your brains out!<eos> No, you won't.
Only got the one.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> You know how big this match is.<eos> Not only are both of these men champions of their respective brand, I mean, you know... Damn.<eos> I should have frozen these Snickers bars first.<eos> What the hell. It's all gonna melt when I cook it.<eos> Maybe I'll freeze it then.<eos> - Mama, what the heck are you doing? - Hot sauce.<eos> Oh, God. Nobody's gonna eat that.<eos> He will.
He's gonna get pretty damn suspicious... when I come home from the hospital without a baby.<eos> You need to relax.<eos> And drink more.<eos> - I have got this whole thing figured out.<eos> - You do? Mm-hmm.<eos> Blondie's due date is right around spring break.<eos> You and I are gonna have a little ladies' week... at a spa down in Cincy that caters to the prenatal set.<eos> But in reality, we're gonna be camped out at Woo's office with Quinn... until that high school hussy drops. Oh.<eos> That's a great plan... except for the fact that Quinn won't give us her baby anymore.<eos> But she will, dummy.
That's how much a sonogram costs.<eos> This is just the beginning.<eos> There's going to be more doctor's visits, Vitamins, new clothes for when I explode.<eos> What are we going to do? What are you going to do?<eos> I'm looking for a job.<eos> I mean, no one's hiring.<eos> I almost got in at olive garden, But they said I was too tall to be a busboy.<eos> Somewhere in that pea brain of yours is a man.<eos> Access him and tell him to prove to me That I chose the right guy to have a baby with.<eos> I will. I
Not very.<eos> There's still another house I can check on the way home.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott Smith?<eos> Me and my kids got nowhere else to be.<eos> My babies just need a place to feel safe at night.<eos> We don't make a mess or nothin'.<eos> You ain't gonna tell?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
And, what, you believe her?<eos> I know this sucks for you, but she's in there because she's involved, so get your fuckin' head on straight.<eos> We don't have any proof.<eos> Come on, Quinn. You're a detective. What does your gut say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're too close to this.<eos> I'm not the only one too close.<eos> She say anything yet?<eos> Nope.<eos> She won't.
I want to be an eyewitness for the shooting.<eos> I thought you said you didn't see anything.<eos> I was in shock.<eos> My memory was fuzzy.<eos> Now it's clear.<eos> There's no doubt in my mind that Nikki shot me and Frank.<eos> Mine either.<eos> Are you talking about going on the record?<eos> And what happens later if you decide you're still confused?<eos> I won't.
Sergeant Riley.<eos> And Dr. Boone. [sighs and gasps of disappointment]<eos> That's 15.<eos> We're done here.<eos> You can fit more people on that thing.<eos> Spencer, I need you to shut up.<eos> Come on, people!<eos> If we don't do something right now, we're done!<eos> He's right, we got to do something. [crowd gasp in shock] Now, I don't want to have to do that to anybody else...<eos> But I will.
-You're an asshole.<eos> Okay, look. Hey, look.<eos> The truth of the matter is you're cursed with schmuckness.<eos> You want my help?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Fine. -I will help you.<eos> -Oh, my gosh. Thank you.<eos> After I slam his dick in this drawer.<eos> -Let's go. He's not gonna help.<eos> -No. No. I will.
For your information, I have a hot date that I'm taking to a fundraising dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> What are you, the emcee?<eos> It's black tie.<eos> You know, not all of us spend our free time with our dvd player and a gallon of chocolate ice cream.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> And for your information, it's a gallon of strawberry ice cream.<eos> Oh! Oh, I see.<eos> Well, you have a good night.<eos> I will.
Your mother asked me to take that out the week after we left.<eos> What, you kept it?<eos> It's brand new.<eos> I got it in my car.<eos> - I'm selling it online. - Good for you.<eos> Maybe you can trade it for a dog.<eos> I still want a dog.<eos> We're not getting a dog once we get back in the house. Exactly.<eos> Who knows if we'll get back in the house?<eos> Sure we will.
- Yes.<eos> Good night, Emily.<eos> Good night.<eos> You know, if you don't marry him, I will.<eos> He's young enough to be your son.<eos> He is not!<eos> Oh, honey. I was just kidding.<eos> Aw... Honey!<eos> If dad finds out about tonight I¡¦m dead.<eos> - He won't.
This is my number.<eos> It goes straight through to my sat phone.<eos> If Perovic doesn't come in by noon tomorrow, you tell him<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> They just got him stabilized.<eos> He's in surgery.<eos> Which way?<eos> They're not gonna let you back there, Olivia.<eos> Like hell they won't.
He organized the bank fraud and he contracted the Kerrigan hit.<eos> Those were the state cops who questioned me.<eos> Well, have they got any evidence?<eos> No, no, nothing real, just O'Hare's word against mine.<eos> - And no documents? - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> I have those. But Kerrigan saw them.<eos> And there's just one problem.<eos> We're screwed if he wakes up.<eos> He won't.
As much as we all appreciate your insightful and incredibly believable theories, Miss "cosmo" is gone, so I believe you can go home now.<eos> Home?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no. This... this case just got good.<eos> And... and I'm... I'm a witness.<eos> All right, I'll let you work this one case with me if you promise to leave me alone when it's over and not to weasel your way back in.<eos> Deal.<eos> But fair warning, detective.<eos> I will make you change your mind.<eos> - I won't.
- In the hallway?<eos> In your ceremony.<eos> Everybody in town knows you humiliated me.<eos> I think I deserve a public apology.<eos> - In the middle of my wedding?<eos> - I found the perfect spot.<eos> Right here.<eos> After the reading from Ecclesiastes and right before We've Only Just Begun.<eos> - I am not doing that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'm glad to see that someone is.<eos> So what do you think of the house so far?<eos> Honestly, I'm a little surprised you girls are such slobs.<eos> You do know you're only getting the second floor tour<eos> - because you're with doris.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Traveling with her sometimes does have its perks.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> What if he recognizes me?<eos> He won't.
You want to fight me? You want to rep Bob Saget, he's all yours.<eos> I'm trying to explain what you're dealing with.<eos> I understand that. I'm trying to explain to you that I'm not buying it.<eos> - Scotty.<eos> - What?<eos> I teed this one up for you.<eos> All you got to do is sell Murray on it and the credit's all yours.<eos> I get it. All I got to do is tell Murray Berenson that Bob Saget wants to fuck in his office.<eos> I don't believe it and I'm just not gonna do it.<eos> Then I will.
Did you consider Telling me, your partner, about this before you did it?<eos> Zoe was gonna take emily, so i had to-- Jeopardize the financial future of this company?<eos> That's a bit dramatic, isn't it?<eos> You know, i--i lied earlier When i said i was devastated about the divorce.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You know, for the first time in 5 years, When i get dressed in the morning, I don't automatically reach for black or brown or navy blue.<eos> I'm wearing pink today, cal, pink,<eos> Because i like pink.<eos> I'm divorced, and i'm free, and i'm happy, And if you do something to screw that up--<eos> I won't.
I wanted us to win.<eos> I wanted to prove that I'm better than he thinks.<eos> What a joke.<eos> You are better than he thinks<eos> And you will prove it to him.<eos> How?<eos> I'm not going to Nationals.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Sasha will cool off, And tomorrow he'll forget all about it.<eos> No, he won't.
They can also get you lost.<eos> One long weekendand I am back in action,okay?<eos> There's no disrupting my life.<eos> You need to disruptyour life.<eos> The allure of a quick fixis what got you addicted in the first place.<eos> I am not some junkiewho needs drugs to get through the day.<eos> I am a guywho got in over my head,and with a little help,<eos> I am getting out... that is,if you will help.<eos> Hank?<eos> Of course I will,but not this way.
I see...<eos> The RED-RACERS are in equally bad shape.<eos> Wait for Colonel Volton's order.<eos> Roger out.<eos> You came all this way to win REDLINE, right?<eos> I'm only halfway there.<eos> I didn't get to see the finish line.<eos> I'll show you. Not much room, but you don't mind, right?<eos> It'll be too heavy. You can't win.<eos> Yes, I will!
- murder at union wells in odessa claire bennet.<eos> - you heard about that?<eos> - a cheerleader in texas gets her head sawed off At the homecoming game?<eos> Yeah, i've heard about that.<eos> - you know, i kind of want to keep the whole Murder at union wells on the d-l.<eos> - no kidding.<eos> I mean, if i were you, i would change my name.<eos> Like now.<eos> They'd probably let you do it over the phone.<eos> - no, they won't.
Twelve girls have gone missing over the years, and they were all her students.<eos> Mother Confessor, we've heard enough.<eos> We've made our decision.<eos> For what she's done, it is our will that this woman die by confession.<eos> She has shown no remorse.<eos> It is our will that she also die by confession.<eos> CROWD:<eos> Yes.<eos> Will the Mother Confessor abide by the wishes of our elders?<eos> I will.
They just left, gave up.<eos> - It's too late for me, but for you... - Oh, no.<eos> There's gotta be another way.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> I was cocky never actually thought I'd lose.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Dean I was wrong.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> Say yes.<eos> But you won't.
I'll go to Cafe Diem. The roads are all iced over.<eos> You'll never make it. I might be able to lend a hand with that.<eos> Just like old times, hey?<eos> I hate old times!<eos> Damn it! Why did I waste my butane on creme brulee?<eos> Zoe, can you see if there's any more cartridges in the back, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> Vincent will get us out.<eos> No, he won't.
When someone says you can't have something you get them fired, which for the record, I do have a problem with, but you don't so it doesn't matter.<eos> You go after what you want and you don't take no for an answer.<eos> - What the?<eos> - Sorry about that.<eos> You have a good arm.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not gonna let some college counselor who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings get in my way.<eos> I just have to find a way to get into CU.<eos> And I will.
Let's go right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> What?<eos> You think you can dangle that ax over my head?<eos> Then go for it.<eos> So you want mom to know?<eos> You want to destroy her life?<eos> Your mom finding out that I had an affair won't destroy her.<eos> Her finding out that you knew about it?<eos> Yeah, that will.
I'm gonna share that one with my next husband when we're spending all your money.<eos> Dad, this is the coolest bike ever.<eos> Awesome.<eos> So, listen, buddy.<eos> Certain members of this family don't think you can take care of this bad boy.<eos> You mean Mom?<eos> Your words, not mine.<eos> Look, uh, your mom and I are a team, and she- we feel like this is a chance for you to show some responsibility.<eos> Don't make us look like jerks here.<eos> I won't.
It's a cow.<eos> Udder.<eos> "I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> Please give me another chance.<eos> I would hate for my careless gesture to spoil our fine romance."<eos> It's the only one they had.<eos> Tthank you, Monk.<eos> I realize how hard this must have been for you to have Natalie buy it for you.<eos> Okay, I bought it, but Mr. Monk paid for it.<eos> Or he will.
I'd go completely crazy without you.<eos> That's what I'm here for.<eos> And you're right.<eos> I'm not obsessing about this anymore.<eos> I'm just gonna give nate his space, and let him figure it out himself.<eos> We're just going to find out what daddy's up to, aren't we, baby boy?<eos> Yes, we are!<eos> And if he's got nothing to hide, he won't mind if I go through all his stuff, will he, baby boy?<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
I don't think so, man.<eos> I'm excited about it. I've just never been outside of Philly. I don't know what people are like.<eos> - Well, people are people.<eos> - Nobody's gonna be, like, a dick?<eos> There are probably gonna be some dicks out there. Yeah, sure. But I'll be there.<eos> I'll back you up, man.<eos> Hey, thanks, man. I tell you what will help.<eos> Shotgun a beer?<eos> That'll calm my nerves.<eos> It sure will.
Unusual to see you here.<eos> That's just what I was going to say.<eos> He's so rarely out of his lab these days.<eos> He takes his work seriously, don't you, Linus?<eos> The light came on.<eos> Midnight.<eos> Mm.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I'm not sure I'm going to have enough time.<eos> Of course you will.

If I release you, what will you do?<eos> That is not your concern.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> Nevertheless, you must promise, or Camelot will fall.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now, please, give me the spell.<eos> Close your eyes and open your mind.<eos> Few men have ever been gifted such knowledge.<eos> Use it wisely.<eos> I will.
Why?<eos> Melinda:<eos> All the time that we were together, I told myself that I was good for you.<eos> But I really wasn't.<eos> I want to be good for you.<eos> Once.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell him I don't know if we were good for each other...<eos> But he--he was the best thing I ever had.<eos> I will.
Okay, so, right now, her lie is making my name less valuable.<eos> But not your game.<eos> That's why we're countering.<eos> I'm gonna ask for four years.<eos> We'll take three.<eos> They offered two, and we ask for four?<eos> It's how the game is played, Nate.<eos> You're sure they won't stop playing?<eos> Buddy, trust me.<eos> They won't.
Too bad Stan isn't here.<eos> He's the one to talk to about pants.<eos> I'm gonna order a suit online.<eos> I've gotta have all my measurements.<eos> Can you do my inseam now?<eos> This is a matter between gentlemen, Mother.<eos> Please, give us the room.<eos> As you wish.<eos> This will not happen, Snot!<eos> Indeed, it will, Steve.
i don't understand. The shadows get you installed As the university president,<eos> And they're responsible for this dead girl Somehow?<eos> Melinda was warned to leave julia alone.<eos> She should listen.<eos> What, the message in her kitchen? She tried to get that girl to cross over into the light.<eos> Is that a bad thing? what do the shadows<eos> Have against going into the light? I'm taking a huge risk just being here.<eos> Hold on! are you saying the shadows<eos> Had something to do with what happened to aiden? All i'm saying is if you and melinda Aren't careful, they will.<eos> They will.
dump sites reveal something about the unsub, you know?<eos> at the very least, a geographic familiarity, a place he knows he won't get caught.<eos> ok, so he knows this road.<eos> yeah, except he abducted kristie in farmington, and then dumps her here in rio rancho.<eos> it's a 175-mile drive.<eos> why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road?<eos> a forensic countermeasure?<eos> covering his tracks by sheer distance?<eos> so the geographical profile won't do us much good.<eos> no, it will, just not with the victims.
We are still here because he told your father. Come.<eos> I know he'll not tell.<eos> How knows him better, you or me?<eos> I know him from childhood.<eos> You know him but haven't understood him.<eos> He loves you and me. He's struggling between us.<eos> Forget about him, first...<eos> They have come, you said he'll not but I said he will.<eos> He told him.<eos> - He will not.
That's acid!<eos> And you cut yourself.<eos> I'm gonna go take her, ok?<eos> Jenny, stop. Jenny, just stop for a second.<eos> There is something going on, isn't there? With you and Callaghan?<eos> No, Erica.<eos> He broke up with me last night, so... so, no, there's absolutely nothing going on.<eos> You need to go to the principal about this.<eos> Jenny, you have to go to the principal about this.<eos> Or I will!
Happy New Year.<eos> So, provided I can get Connor to give me the money...<eos> We buy out Hartley and reinstate you at Mode with 50% ownership.<eos> With equal veto power.<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> May I now kiss the bride?<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Can you really do this without consulting your mother first?<eos> Please, focus on getting that money back.<eos> Oh, I will.
Uther has disinherited Arthur...<eos> and made Catrina his heir.<eos> So if Uther dies, she will rule Camelot.<eos> We are gathered here to bear witness to the naming of Queen Catrina as the rightful heir to Camelot.<eos> Are you willing to take the oath?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to govern the people of Camelot, to uphold the laws and customs of the land?<eos> I... do.<eos> Will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?<eos> I will.
We ordered sushi and learned about the Kombai tribes of New Guinea.<eos> Good times.<eos> I need sex, like I need water. I'm in a desert.<eos> And it's not actually the sex that I miss, which I would be very grateful for, let's be clear about that.<eos> It's just that feeling, you know, of being alive.<eos> I mean, the flutter that you get in your stomach when you first kiss someone and your lips part your tongues...<eos> Stop. Just stop.<eos> I gotta sit.<eos> I need it, too, but if you tell anybody...<eos> I won't.
I know what we said, but... when I look at you and I think about what they're about to do...<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> If you want to save the baby, Eleanor has to have surgery.<eos> I'm scared, too, Ronnie.<eos> But this our baby.<eos> Okay, maybe it's not my egg, but it's got your DNA.<eos> Honey, it's your child.<eos> It's not that I don't love it. I do. But ght now...<eos> I love you more. I can't even think about losing you.<eos> But you will.
What are we gonna to do?<eos> You boys got a show to do.<eos> Don't worry, I'll be right here when you're done.<eos> I'm going to have a little meeting with these guys.<eos> We thought you were dead. You're right, Nathan.<eos> I was dead.<eos> I made sure that I was pronounced dead on the premises.<eos> Where were you for the last nine months?<eos> I can't tell you now. But when the time is right,<eos> I will.
And yet, I caught you.<eos> You went right where I asked you to go.<eos> You're mike287.<eos> You making a little abby movie?<eos> Oh, that's for watching you when I go to work.<eos> I took the day off today so we could be together.<eos> After all, abby, We're a team.<eos> There's no "i" in your team.<eos> You'll resist at first, And maybe I'll wait for you to come around.<eos> Or... Maybe I won't.
To be near you one last time.<eos> Why does this have to be so hard?<eos> We're almost to your floor.<eos> You want me to come in?<eos> Yes, which is why you can't.<eos> But then again, these elevators can take forever.<eos> Cyrus, enough.<eos> Yes, enough.<eos> I will. I will tell her.<eos> I will.
Cara, if Richard is truly out of control, then maybe only Mord-Sith magic can stop him from using the Sword.<eos> Caldor's main camp.<eos> All those tents.<eos> There must be a hundred men.<eos> That's a hundred more souls for us to send to the Keeper.<eos> How do we fight that many?<eos> We don't.<eos> These are the men who killed our fathers.<eos> We can't let them live.<eos> We won't.
Amen.<eos> Dance with me?<eos> Teddy...<eos> Come on, one dance.<eos> Between friends.<eos> Fine, between friends.<eos> You know, I probably shouldn't leave Naomi for too long since she's my date and all.<eos> I'm sure she'll survive.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course she will.
You still can.<eos> You saved Jack.<eos> You know, I may have the tools to do this job, but I don't know if I have the tools to help my son.<eos> You have to ask yourself what kind of father you want to be.<eos> And when you figure that out<eos> Then you'll know what to do.<eos> I meant what I said today.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> And I need to do what's best for Jack.<eos> You will.
Come on, boys!<eos> (Good luck.)<eos> Start.<eos> Please start.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Don't come any closer.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> But they will.
Take it off.<eos> Well, what if the engine blows<eos> After the factory warranty expires? Yeah.<eos> You just told me you're gonna sell a product where the engine's gonna blow?<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> Then take it off.<eos> We don't need it.<eos> But it could blow.<eos> But it won't.
People can sort things out themselves.<eos> Let's go, I have to work.<eos> Work can wait, busy man.<eos> Look, a Volga! Follow it!<eos> I'll kill you, you bastard!<eos> That's life. You can't change the world.<eos> Have you ever tried?<eos> That attack could have been gang-related.<eos> They'll find you and no one will help you.<eos> But you will, won't you?
Can I help y...?<eos> God... I said I don't need you.<eos> I'm a customer today.<eos> But you know,after we make fake DNA test results what do we do with that?<eos> First, we make the 'receiver' the son's name, just as if he payed for it.<eos> And then?<eos> And then we have to make sure the father in law reads it.<eos> But then won't he ask his son, 'Were you suspecting it too?<eos> '<eos> He won't.
please, I'm begging you, okay?<eos> Look, I'm really sorry I stole Octa.<eos> I don't know what came over me.<eos> -I never steal things.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because it's wrong.<eos> So then you've learnt a valuable moral lesson.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> And you'II never do anything wrong again, as long as you live.<eos> -No, I won't.
People don't usually recognize me. Not on the subway, anyway. Ha, ha.<eos> My name's Henry.<eos> How funny.<eos> I have a son named Henry.<eos> I met a girl.<eos> And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time.<eos> Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.
Love is a myth to keep the minds of young peasants and virgins occupied with a dream.<eos> - It has no place in our world.<eos> - In your world!<eos> I do not understand you though.<eos> It would be benifitial for you if I married Erzebet.<eos> So you could grand me a tiny portion of her land?<eos> She never marry you.<eos> Your blood is not noble enough.<eos> - You are leaving today for Denmark.<eos> - I will not.
But you?<eos> You can give your poor daddy everything he ever wanted.<eos> Come on, Tiana.<eos> You're almost there.<eos> My daddy never did get what he wanted.<eos> But he had what he needed.<eos> He had love.<eos> He never lost sight of what was really important.<eos> - Easy with that. Careful.<eos> - And neither will I!
They cost too much, they take too long and they involve too many people, so...<eos> They should have grand titles.<eos> And might you tell the press what the film is about?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know what my last film's about.<eos> That was the problem.<eos> Nobody else did.<eos> Of course I can tell you what my film is about. I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I'm going to cast and the music I want to use.<eos> I can tell you everything.<eos> But I won't.
All you want.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> What do y'all do with all the leftover food from the restaurant?<eos> We have to throw some out, what's already cooked.<eos> -That's too bad.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I'd rather sell it.<eos> Seems like you could give it away or something.<eos> -You should check into that, Daddy.<eos> -All right, I will, SJ.
Yeah, one of us will just have to change venues.<eos> Right.<eos> One of us could.<eos> Probably not the one of us who's been saving up for a decade... ... becauseshemakesapittance compared to the other one of us. But--<eos> True.<eos> Or it would be if the other one of us wasn't so desperate to get married... ... atThePlaza,becauseThePlaza is the only happy memory... ... shehasof herchildhood.<eos> So, oops, that's--<eos> Right.<eos> One of us will have to move her date.<eos> Yep, one of us will.
I'll knock your― oh, oh.<eos> - Come on, then.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> - Colin! - No, don't rise to it, Pop. - Eh?<eos> - Yeah, you're right.<eos> Why give her the satisfaction?<eos> Wouldn't give her the pickings out of me handkerchief.<eos> - He's not saying much, is he, Tom Cruise?<eos> - He's keeping his head down, hoping it will go away.<eos> - Well, it won't!
That I could trust with my kids for two weeks?<eos> This is a disaster!<eos> I don't have anybody else!<eos> That's not true.<eos> No, no.<eos> You have me.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll take the kids.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> - I will.
That wasn't a threat, Caprica.<eos> No... That was a threat.<eos> I don't know why you couldn't have children, Ellen.<eos> Sometimes love must not be enough because he loved you.<eos> Yes, this...<eos> This is rough.<eos> But what can I do?<eos> If I make him choose between you and me, I know the best I could do would be to tear him in half.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't.
Start off-loading the civilians by tomorrow.<eos> The full crew and officers transferred ... by the end of the week.<eos> What?<eos> We're abandoning ship, Tigh.<eos> No.<eos> No, you can't do this.<eos> I have to, Saul.<eos> She's dying. And we both know it.<eos> As your XO, I can't let you do this.<eos> I won't!
I'm sorry. Did you want something?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I've narrowed it down to Toofer or Frank.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God, I am famished. Oh.<eos> Those are Jack's.<eos> Come on, guys, whoever did it, just confess so we can get out of here.<eos> Why are you looking at me and Lutz?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I think Lutz will tell you that, uh, I'm innocent.<eos> No, I won't, dude.
I'm sorry.<eos> Well,don't be sorry to me.Be sorry to father mike.<eos> You call him,he'll hear your confession and he'll get you and callie into counseling.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> -It is not too late.<eos> You made a vow to callie and a vow to god.<eos> you just don't walk away from that.<eos> This is your soul we're talking about.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No,you will not.
It was presented to Taketa Morisaki by the Emperor of Japan."<eos> Is he on the level?<eos> The belt's a fucking national treasure.<eos> It's worth a quarter of a mil.<eos> He's going to give it to Ricardo if he loses?<eos> It's publicity.<eos> It's publicity.<eos> It's something to tell the papers.<eos> It's a story. "I am a samurai, should this gaijin defeat me I will surrender my fucking belt."<eos> And will he?
In private.<eos> - Which friend?<eos> -This way, my Lady.<eos> Jane.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I ask you only one thing:<eos> that you allow me to serve and worship you.<eos> As Lancelot served and worshipped Guinevere.<eos> Sweet gentle Lady, will you let me so?<eos> I will.
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing, huh?<eos> Let go. I'm looking for my boyfriend.<eos> Let go. Don't touch me.<eos> Let me- - Let go.<eos> No, you look.<eos> This is not America.<eos> You're scaring the other passengers.<eos> If you don't stop, I'll confine you to a locked compartment.<eos> You said you'd help.<eos> And I will.
Nothing you could do will ever stop me loving you.<eos> I'd give you some, kid, but, you know, you're underage.<eos> What you doin'?<eos> Leaving.<eos> I'm the common denominator here.<eos> If I go everyone's, problems will be solved.<eos> You can't!<eos> No?<eos> I can't put Debbie through this.<eos> I won't.
Chill out, it's not him!<eos> There's no point in going under.<eos> I know, I'm trying!<eos> People will notice!<eos> They'll come here looking first.<eos> So what if they do?<eos> He left drunk.<eos> He fell in a ditch.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> You won't.
It's the First freakin' Daughter, man.<eos> - Who's got a camera?<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> One picture.<eos> - No No pictures<eos> She said, no pictures.<eos> Oh, and what are you gonna do, huh?<eos> Call Secret Service?<eos> - Ow! - No, but I will.
Well, you're not gonna live here that long, right?<eos> Esperanza, she's like the local newspaper around here.<eos> I think she cornered the real estate agent and so we got the lowdown on you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, so what are you doing? Buying it, selling it and making a profit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> Well, don't sell it to any weirdoes, okay?<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
- Fucking white people.<eos> Pull this out.<eos> I ain't playing.<eos> - You're gonna be all over the fucking Net.<eos> - Stop. Fuck off.<eos> Dude, you're fucking squirting everywhere.<eos> - You're a squirter. - Shane.<eos> What about my brother?<eos> I don't wanna lose him.<eos> You won't.
Let me guess. "Supreme combat" pasta?<eos> No, just bugs and tennis rackets.<eos> Bugs and tennis rackets?<eos> I do have a really cool boyfriend.<eos> I don't know what this road trip was about, Robert, but if there's something wrong with you, you need to know what it is, not avoid it.<eos> - Now the doctors-- they want to--<eos> - I know there's something wrong with me.<eos> I don't need a doctor to tell me.<eos> Because it's never good news when they wanna run more tests.<eos> And they will... tomorrow.
But I don't want you to go away.<eos> Why do you have to leave?<eos> I really don't wanna leave you, it's just...<eos> Your mommy doesn't like Nanny Carrie.<eos> She wants me to leave.<eos> But I want you to stay.<eos> So do I.<eos> But your mom's the boss and what she says goes.<eos> I wish you were my little boy.<eos> I always will.
And Where You Want To Be.<eos> Hey. Aren't You Supposed To Be At Your Mom's Engagement Thing?<eos> Yeah, Well, I Had To Get Out Of There.<eos> It Was Getting A Little Hard To Breathe, You Know?<eos> Those Parties Can Be That Way.<eos> So Are You, Um, Packing Up Your Music?<eos> Nah.<eos> I Just...<eos> Need To Find Something New To Write About.<eos> And I Will.
- So it was you, right?<eos> Use your words, Sammy.<eos> What was me?<eos> This.<eos> - You got Ryan a concert.<eos> - Oh, wow, this came out pretty sharp.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The umlaut was my idea.<eos> - You made him sell you his soul?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
It killed Superman.<eos> I'm just a man.<eos> You really are, like, a super special kind of asshole, aren't you?<eos> I ride the special-kind-of-asshole bus.<eos> - Do you really?<eos> - All right. Okay.<eos> - One more bite.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Alexis is gonna freak out when she sees this.<eos> - No she won't.
I won't do it, and I won't...<eos> You see, what I think it is, is- ...is I think I'm more comfortable with being disappointed.<eos> I think I'm angry with you for trying to take that away.<eos> Mum, I love you, but not now.<eos> Should I take that as a hopeful sign?<eos> If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
Code name for the president.<eos> Biggest bird in the west.<eos> The watchroom is in town hall.<eos> The president will be making a stop outside of jennings and rail first before heading out to the farm for the speech.<eos> And how long's he scheduled to be on main street?<eos> 20 minutes.<eos> Shake some hands on the rope line, meet and greet with the mayor.<eos> Well,that sounds like the time for us to make our move.<eos> You got the password yet?<eos> I will.
tell her.<eos> Tell me what? Nothing.<eos> Nothing,there's nothing to tell.<eos> You said you'd have no one at the wedding... so we asked JenningsRall to trace your family. What did you find?<eos> Nothing. I mean,we found your father's second cousin on a census in indiana, but the area had already been evacuated.<eos> And there was a woman with the same last name in a nearby refugee camp. But she wasn't related.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I really wanted you to have your family at the wedding.<eos> I will.
Thank you, Sookie.<eos> - We'll be in touch.<eos> - Let's roll before I melt in here.<eos> Stop.<eos> Mama, I don't need any sunblock.<eos> Please, Hoyt, if anyone needs sunblock, it's you.<eos> Your skin's whiter than Desitin.<eos> Mama, I'm gonna move out.<eos> I swear it, I will.<eos> You won't.
I never knew and I do not know Sarah Connor.<eos> If you see or hear anything, call me.<eos> Any time. I never sleep.<eos> Just a reminder: Grief counseling will be available in my office throughout the week.<eos> -What are they doing?<eos> -Writing notes, for Jordan.<eos> She's dead.<eos> -Yeah, I remember watching her fall.<eos> -Me too. How will she get the notes?<eos> -She won't.
Yeah.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Did you Id the girl from the apartment?<eos> Her name is Ana Llorca, worked for a local pizza place.<eos> Apparently made a few deliveries to his address.<eos> We also found a jeep registered under the name Roberto Rosa.<eos> We are trying to locate it now.<eos> We're not sure if he keeps it on the island or the mainland to get from one crime scene to the next.<eos> It's a lot of ground to cover but we'll fucking find him, Tom.<eos> - No, you won't.
You're paying him today, right?<eos> I just need to know where.<eos> He - he said he was gonna direct me to the hand-off once the job's done.<eos> Maybe he said, "just be in your car with the money in the gables, ready to go. "<eos> He's doing it walking distance from the hit.<eos> Oh, that is nice.<eos> Okay. This is what we're gonna do.<eos> You will go where he says, you will give him your cash, and then you will hit the deck when the bullets start flying.<eos> Once Michael's dead, then you can run, and, Drew, if you ever come back, I will find you.<eos> - I won't.
No, no, wait, don't give it to him.<eos> Don't give it to him.<eos> Come on, let it.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Why?<eos> He won't give it back;<eos> he'll just sell it.<eos> Don't you remember I lost my phone just, like, a month ago in a cab, and I never got it back.<eos> If you give it to the cab company then they'll-- they'll call the people that--<eos> No, they won't.
Okay, you're never going to prove that. Never.<eos> I just did.<eos> Not after I talk to the state attorney and tell them that you coerced evidence unlawfully.<eos> Assault and battery.<eos> You beat me up to get what you needed. You stole my shoelace. Nice try, Ron.<eos> Well, that bruise should show up about the same time as the state attorney, I would say, don't you?<eos> Now, Horatio, tell me.<eos> Are they gonna believe me, or are they gonna blame a cop who got extradited to brazil for killing a man?<eos> Just remember what I said, Ron.<eos> I will.
Like what?<eos> Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?<eos> Eat at the diner every night? Steak and cobbler?<eos> Dad, that's you. That's not me.<eos> Bella, come on, I just...<eos> I just got you back.<eos> Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now, then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.<eos> Your father's gonna forgive you.<eos> Why don't you let me drive?<eos> He won't.
Eat, drink, make merry and..<eos> ..ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Excuse me, daddy.<eos> - Yes, my darling.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> - Yes!<eos> What nonsense, daddy?<eos> This is not nonsense, this is serious lt can't be announced right away that this was a joke.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will.
- That's boring to me.<eos> - Oh, Cheryl. The opportunities are endless with this setup.<eos> - Right? Thank you very much, Larry.<eos> - Yeah. Oh, and, hey, I have got an ex-girlfriend from college that's working at Innovative Identity Group.<eos> - You know, we can just--<eos> - Greg.<eos> - Just kind of--<eos> - Greg.<eos> No. - So let's say this actually happens.<eos> - Which it will.
Look!<eos> Looks good to me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Zack, I love you.<eos> I believe this just about sums things up, kids.<eos> Yes?<eos> No?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Jason and Cindy cannot beat you again in Miami.<eos> - They won't.
If I'm not back in 10 minutes, well... call the police.<eos> Call the police for what?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Make her pay.<eos> Harry.<eos> Harry.<eos> Harry!<eos> Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.<eos> Yeah. If I have to...<eos> I will.
And I don't either.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> Your letter killed me.<eos> I mean, if I don't have you or Michael to come home to... I'm not gonna make it.<eos> It's just that any time I hang on to any bit of hope, it gets taken away from me.<eos> So you tell me.<eos> Do I wait for you?<eos> I want you to.<eos> But I understand if you can't.<eos> Well, I will.
Move your ass!<eos> One of us just got lucky.<eos> I'm thinking it was me, baby.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Any closer, I'll spray her brains all over the street.<eos> Drop it!<eos> I'll kill her, I swear to God!<eos> I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I care about you. Susannah is going to Mr. Blackthorn.<eos> They've come up with a plan.<eos> It had better be a good one. I'm to sail to the New World.<eos> When?<eos> Today.<eos> Father, you will see me again.<eos> I'm sure I will.<eos> Susannah will get me a pardon. And when it's safe for me to return to London, she'll put a notice in the London Gazette.<eos> You'll never see that.<eos> One way or another I will.
Well, he can think again.<eos> Maybe you should go and see him.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You never know when you'll see him again.<eos> Like I care.<eos> What if something happens?<eos> What if it was the last time?<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - No... you won't.
And you'll get your money.<eos> Everyone's a winner.<eos> - Now that's how I want it.<eos> - For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> I didn't think things through.<eos> It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
What kind of killer could I possibly be?<eos> The kind that leaves tracks.<eos> Those are gurney tracks where the paramedics wheeled away Colonel Likkin.<eos> Those treads that go from the batter back to the deep fryer are killer tracks.<eos> Yours.<eos> Those are hot-oil burns on your hands.<eos> Did the colonel spatter when you deep-fat-fried him you sick son of a bitch?<eos> Pixie dust and lemonade.<eos> You have no proof. That story will never hold up in court.<eos> This will.
Monk is no longer the morale Officer.<eos> Still no signal.<eos> Phone lines must go through here.<eos> Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk.<eos> Come on, you have to...<eos> Come on, you gotta pull yourself together.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me. We just have to make it until 9:00 am.<eos> When the bank opens, they'll open the vault.<eos> No, they won't.
I'm afraid they took everything they could carry.<eos> They even found a ring I had been saving for my engagement.<eos> I have to know, mr.<eos> Dubois: How exactly did you think to advise me to buy a lock on the very day I was about to be robbed?<eos> Um, well, uh... it really has nothingto do with me.<eos> Uh, like I told you,it's my daughter.<eos> Um, she... uh,she worries about people, and at times, it-it... seems like she's very... prescient. Do you know what I mean by that?<eos> I think I can guess.<eos> Will you please tell her I appreciate her effortson my behalf?<eos> I will.
It's a big day tomorrow.<eos> The biggest day.<eos> I'll get back to you, Molly.<eos> What did Evan get you for your birthday?<eos> A Blackberry.<eos> We'll get you some more and you can make a birthday crumble.<eos> Have we met before, Alex?<eos> I was scared and I was so alone, and you took my hand.<eos> What would you do if your goddaughter found out?<eos> She won't.
We still got a chance to get out of this.<eos> After what you did?<eos> What chance?<eos> What you did, too. Remember?<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Says who, huh?<eos> You?<eos> It's your word against mine, bud.<eos> I just want this to end.<eos> It will, all right?
That young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these days.<eos> Today?<eos> Yeah, well, until I open him up, I can't say for sure.<eos> But all indications are that he was killed by the gunshot wound.<eos> There are no defensive wounds, no lacerations, no abrasions, no contusions.<eos> And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.<eos> A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?<eos> Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.<eos> Ask different questions, Duck.<eos> I will, Jethro.
You cut my toast in those little triangles I like.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Just for you.<eos> - That looks so good, boy.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You just wait till she comes back, though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, grandma.<eos> Well...<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yep. We will.
I suddenly understand what your mother must feel.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> You're easy on your father.<eos> He disappears for months, then barges in unannounced, wants to break into your therapy.<eos> He invades your private space, but still you defend him.<eos> He is always the king.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry because he's never coming back here again.<eos> So you can have your crown back.<eos> - Okay, let's say, he does come back.<eos> - He won't.
- If we'd been one minute later<eos> We weren't.<eos> - We stopped him.<eos> - What happens when you have to stop me?<eos> - If the freezing doesn't work?<eos> - It won't come to that.<eos> I can feel it coming. It's pushing me out.<eos> What will you do when I lose my last bit of me?<eos> We will figure something out, Beth.<eos> No, we won't.
But we understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't, Jack!<eos> You all think it's cold and lonely out there.<eos> But it isn't for me because I have him.<eos> He matters.<eos> And I've lied to him for long enough.<eos> What he did today was so brave, braver than any of us because we signed up for this.<eos> He did it because he loves me, and I won't take that away from him!<eos> I won't!
In fact, he never gets mad at Chloe, so I told him you did it.<eos> - Me? - Yes.<eos> Just like that other time with the bad nurse who kept telling on you and me?<eos> Remember we told daddy that you hit her?<eos> This is just like that.<eos> And now everything's going to be fine.<eos> You can keep my secret for me, can't you, baby?<eos> And you'll never tell daddy the truth?<eos> Even if he asks?<eos> No, I won't.
Driving me nuts.<eos> I already looked in there. Ah.<eos> Well, you must have missed it. How am I expected to cook if you're always hiding things, huh?<eos> Are the kids upstairs?<eos> Last time I checked.<eos> Hey, there's a spot.<eos> Where? Here.<eos> It's teeny.<eos> No one will notice that.<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
His story checks out.<eos> - Sheriff?<eos> This sounds important.<eos> You better punch up Line 2.<eos> Sheriff Landry.<eos> Bring my brother to the center of Market Square in Santa Luna, Mexico.<eos> Sundown, this Friday.<eos> Once my brother is released, you'll get the girl.<eos> At one minute later, if I don't see my brother, I'll assume you want me to kill her.<eos> And I will.
If you fall I will catch you<eos> I'll be waiting<eos> Time after time<eos> What do the lyrics mean?<eos> It's about a broken heart<eos> But my favorite part is<eos> If you're lost you can look<eos> And you will find me<eos> I love this part<eos> You will, huh?
We've done what we said.<eos> We brought them safely here.<eos> We have.<eos> Ain't our business to do owt else.<eos> I won't argue with that.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> We should just... just leave them, then, eh?<eos> We should.<eos> But you won't.
Helena...<eos> Helena...<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But when did beauty ever pay the rent?<eos> I am sorry, Em.<eos> I just got caught up in the passion of it.<eos> It was like it was waiting, calling to me.<eos> I suppose you can't leave the poor thing unfinished.<eos> - I can and I will.<eos> - Oh, no, you won't.
Come home to Craigy.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Seriously, dude, I am totally losing it.<eos> Can you just leave?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Peace out.<eos> But check this, okay?<eos> If I take one step out this door, you'll never see me again.<eos> Yeah, I Will.
You're not from around here, are you?<eos> No scar.<eos> The past, right?<eos> Which means, to you, I'm the boogeyman.<eos> It's a hell of a thing.<eos> You coming here to find out That you and I are brothers.<eos> Brothers?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that you've come all this way, peter, But I can't help you.<eos> Can't?<eos> I won't.
Pull the trigger.<eos> No! If you don't do it, I will.<eos> Okay, mom,<eos> Your turn to spin.<eos> Listen to me. Leave them alone! I-<eos> Oh, you got to love the irony.<eos> I mean, it's like a greek tragedy or something, right?<eos> Okay, mom,<eos> Do it.<eos> I won't.
I should be at the Ark.<eos> You stay there until the area is clear. Understood?<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Just goodbye.<eos> It's me. Cutter's here.<eos> I'm going to have to get out.<eos> What about your men?<eos> No sign, but don't worry, we've got contingency plans.<eos> - If Nick finds out...<eos> - Well, he won't.
- Exactly.<eos> If you want it to work... You take a piece of cloth, cut 2 holes for your eyes, snip-snip, we tie it around our heads, and there you have it!<eos> Anything else?<eos> You want an autograph?<eos> - Sure, why not?<eos> A couple of lines?<eos> It's still very rough. - I want to hear it.<eos> Now? - Yes.<eos> Men, Lanze's going to sing a song.<eos> - No, I won't.
We may be opponents on the field but outside we're friends.<eos> - We're no friends.<eos> - l wanted to give you something.<eos> What?<eos> - This.<eos> - What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> - l won this for you.<eos> - Don't want it.<eos> - Will you please take it?<eos> - l won't.
I fucking hate you.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> 130 English pounds.<eos> I claim my prize.<eos> American Pie.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> Man, you said we were gonna get jiggy!<eos> I said you'd get laid, Jake.<eos> And you will.
All dead.<eos> - Maybe she went away for Christmas.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I'll go out tomorrow, I'll walk into town.<eos> There's got to be work.<eos> Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> just you wait, Mum.<eos> What if it never gets better?<eos> Course it will.
- Guys,I'm just a coroner assistant.<eos> Caught you **,you are not going nowhere,man.<eos> Hold down,hold down now fellas,he is just doing his job.<eos> Mr. Bell is our first priority.<eos> We are gonna have him back here as soon as we can.<eos> Ok,you guys go help with the funeral band too?<eos> Yeah,buy another casket?<eos> 'cause that was donated by the community.<eos> - We'll pay for a new casket.<eos> - We will?
- Say what?<eos> - I screwed up.<eos> You can say it, probie.<eos> It was not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.
What do you need help with? Besides remembering the groom's name?<eos> I'd cut him out of the will if I thought there was a chance he'd outlive me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, Teddy, darling. What's up?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That's wonderful. Can you keep it up till I get there?<eos> All right, I want to make sure we're all on the same page here.<eos> This wedding will be ruined if Mom finds out... ... hersonandfuturestepdaughter have been carrying on behind her back.<eos> -Don't worry.<eos> -She won't.
Cut 'em fresh.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> How long Can we stay here?<eos> Uh, well, old man stratman Doesn't usually come back Until the first.<eos> You know, I figure our dads Won't be looking for us Around here by then, So we could just slip away.<eos> You know, baby, We can go wherever We want to go.<eos> The money that I saved up,<eos> You know, you and I Just buy a house, Just escape.<eos> My daddy finds us, He'll kill you. I know he will.<eos> No, he won't.

There's something he needs me to do.<eos> I just don't know what.<eos> Well, the whole place is covered, all of London, they're saying.<eos> The whole world.<eos> It's the scale of it, Donna.<eos> I mean, how can one man stop all that?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He can do it.<eos> Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him he'll have to answer to me.<eos> I will.
Changing the planet into a clone world.<eos> Earth becomes a hatchery.<eos> The Sontarans are clones, it's how they reproduce.<eos> Give 'em a planet this big, they'll create billions of new soldiers.<eos> That gas isn't poison, it's food!<eos> My heart... It's getting slower.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> In your mind, you've got so many plans.<eos> There's so much that you want to do.<eos> And I will.
I didn't want to shoot you.<eos> I was just trying to make a score.<eos> I didn't know you'd get there first.<eos> You really want to kill him?<eos> Go ahead, Andy.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> You're never gonna answer for it.<eos> Not in this world.<eos> That's right.<eos> Didi will.
I wanted you to understand.<eos> I do.<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I can go.<eos> I wish you didn't have to.<eos> Sara. This is a good thing.<eos> You made me mortal.<eos> Only to lose you.<eos> We should have had more time.<eos> We will.
I don't know about enjoying his company.<eos> He's like a car crash in slow motion.<eos> Which can be fascinating.<eos> You want to watch a car crash, give him the address of the writer, Danny Spader.<eos> He wants to know the truth about this case, so...<eos> let him see the truth.<eos> - He won't like it.<eos> - None of us like it.<eos> Well what if it pushes him in the wrong direction?<eos> It won't.
Dave, he kills her.<eos> And then I think he's going to kill me too.<eos> It was just a cock-up.<eos> It was a total bloody cock-up.<eos> He's a liar though isn't he, he's lying!<eos> Everybody's a liar.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> What if he finds out where you're keeping him?<eos> - He won't.
I've done everything you asked.<eos> No, you haven't, or she wouldn't be asking me these questions about Paul Eastman.<eos> There are ways to fix that if you'd let me.<eos> Where did I go wrong to make you hate your sister so much?<eos> You really need me to answer that?<eos> I have to go.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Leave me alone, do you hear me?<eos> I won't let you do this to me.<eos> I won't.
If you tell me what's wrong, we can figure it out together.<eos> Figure out what?<eos> That I'm a freak?<eos> Julian, you're not a freak.<eos> Please, Julian, we've got to talk about this.<eos> This is totally normal, but we can't make it better if you run away from me.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You can't tell anybody.<eos> I won't.
So what does that make you, then?<eos> Go on, shut me up.<eos> Cos you are just their bitch.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> - What if he finds out you're keeping him alive?<eos> - He won't.
That's not funny.<eos> It's not meant to be funny.<eos> Allison, look, if you hadn't told me about Rory Carmer's ghost riding shotgun, I'd be driving it around right now thinking it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.<eos> Oh, right. So now it's my fault?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> Look, you, you know what I'm saying.<eos> I know. We have to sell it.<eos> Um, yes. Hold on, hold on, sweetie, hold on.<eos> Yeah, well, we will.
Did nothing wrong.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> It's ok. It's ok.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that i didn't do anything with those other guys.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> I will.
You're not telling me what to do.<eos> No, you have to come with us so we can Take you to thandor and get back to our friend<eos> This may be hard for you to comprehend, But the fate of the world just might depend on it.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I'm sorry to have to do this. But I can't let you run away again.<eos> Don't! Unh!<eos> You will not bind his hands!<eos> It's ok, I am not gonna hurt him.<eos> I'm just gonna make sure-- no!<eos> You will not.
- Don't you trust me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - It must've been something you said.<eos> - I don't know why you weren't told.<eos> But you said I should be.<eos> Aren't you curious why I wasn't?<eos> Yes!<eos> Do you want me to find out why you weren't told?<eos> - If it's important to you.<eos> - Fine. I will.
What exactly is that pile of ashes?<eos> It turned out to be the victim's intestines.<eos> The abdomen had been slashed opened.<eos> And with a body so badly burned, intestines reduced to ashes, how did you identify the remains as those of deputy director kirby?<eos> I've got nothing to say.<eos> You're under oath as a material witness, ms. Montenegro.<eos> I swore to tell the truth, and the truth is that I am not saying anything.<eos> judge haddoes, could you...<eos> - The witness will answer.<eos> - No, the witness will not.
I honestly don't know.<eos> Tick-tock, Bill.<eos> Bill...<eos> Just look after yourself, all right?<eos> I've asked Sam to watch over you.<eos> I wish you hadn't have done that.<eos> Be smart, Sookie, and just let him.<eos> There's still somebody out there who wants to kill you.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
Thanks.<eos> Good night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> Jeez.<eos> You are way above the Greek noise limit!<eos> Hysterical.<eos> - Now get out of here.<eos> - Before we do sir, if you wouldn't mind blowing into this before you drive your lovely date home.<eos> I will not.
Hello.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> David, I want to marry her.<eos> Yeah, I know, Bob.<eos> And then we're gonna buy a house, and we're gonna get a puppy.<eos> And Nina's gonna have a vegetable garden because she loves to garden.<eos> And...<eos> Why is this happening, David?<eos> Why can't we fix it?<eos> We will, Bob.

Yeah.<eos> I'll see if I can't get a match to ours.<eos> Mayko, do you think you can get me a list of every lab, zoo, I don't know, university labs researching feline genealogy?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> But even if I do...<eos> You find the lab, I'll make them own up, believe me.<eos> We may never know who's responsible for this.<eos> But if we're right, It's still out there. It's likely to kill again.<eos> You wanna call the Sheriff?<eos> Yeah, I will.
But he's trying to cure cancer.<eos> Who wouldn't support that?<eos> Well, if they get behind the drug and it fails, It could bankrupt the whole company.<eos> They're terrified.<eos> - Well he never said anything to me.<eos> - You know Denny.<eos> He could break his arm and you wouldn't know it.<eos> He's really suffering.<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
Now they'll know when one of them dies.<eos> Great planning.<eos> - You couldn't have known.<eos> - But I should have.<eos> Every single one of them has stage 4 cancer.<eos> Some of them are lucky to be alive.<eos> I chose the room, the chairs, the program.<eos> I just spent so much time trying to get it right.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Next time you will.
Hey, everybody.<eos> Lieutenant Provenza, even you're here.<eos> Thank you for coming down.<eos> Anything you need, you, uh, you know, just let us know.<eos> Are you hungry, sir?<eos> Did everybody get some pizza?<eos> Uh, did you guys get some pizza?<eos> Because I ordered plenty of pizza.<eos> So, please, make sure that you get some, sir.<eos> I will.
- Like who cleans up the next day.<eos> - What item's that?<eos> - 28. For Christ's sake, just get on with it.<eos> - Item four, food.<eos> - Good.<eos> She did it as a bet.<eos> One more time, that's not true.<eos> Say what you like, I know it was a bet.<eos> - Ask her.<eos> - I will.
I thought you said nine years.<eos> I was promoted again this morning.<eos> I'm now director of mail systems.<eos> Nice work, Hornberger.<eos> Are these dolls?<eos> Are they?<eos> Mommy!<eos> They're called little creepers.<eos> Oh, is it so wrong that I just want to have one of these to grow up and resent me?<eos> Oh, you will.
I am the last person you wanna fuck with, because I will fuck you back in ways you never even imagined!<eos> An anonymous tip, couple of search warrants. Hmm?<eos> Who knows what the police might find in your apartment or in that little boat of yours.<eos> You got the ring!<eos> I got City fucking Hall!<eos> I didn't get it before, Miguel, but you can't be reasoned with, guilted, controlled.<eos> This whole back-and-forth game for leverage is pointless.<eos> That's right! I'll do what I want, when I want, to whomever I want!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.
You've gotta be kidding.<eos> He also requests conjugal visitation.<eos> Jesus, you have no shame! And no case!<eos> Run the evidence from the crime scene, will you?<eos> Blood at the scene belonged to Albert Chung.<eos> DNA matched his sample in our database.<eos> Odds are 170 million to one that it's anyone but Albert Chung.<eos> Mmm, it won't hold up.<eos> You do know what odds are?<eos> The jury won't.
Good job.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I need that guy's booking slip.<eos> His lawyer called.<eos> Rezian get the money?<eos> As far as I know.<eos> Okay. Just get there early, and make sure he stays calm.<eos> Look, I know what to do.<eos> I wanna make sure that we don't miss out on a payday, that's all.<eos> We won't, man.
You have to go.<eos> Do it.<eos> - What? - Go.<eos> Move!<eos> Call to him.<eos> Call to him.<eos> - You're making this difficult.<eos> - He won't come back!<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
But I understand more than you think.<eos> So you understand that I'm going to keep seeing riley, Even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.<eos> I understand that it's a bad idea.<eos> And I understand that being john connor can be lonely.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How do you understand that?<eos> You and I talk about it a lot.<eos> We do?<eos> We do.<eos> We will.
Women are the oppressed ones.<eos> And it's even harder being a beautiful woman.<eos> Everyone assumes I don't try in bed.<eos> - It's discrimination. - Whatever.<eos> You couldn't last one day in my shoes, maroney.<eos> Right, Toof?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I could totally be black.<eos> You should try being a white woman.<eos> Okay, I will.
How advanced is your colleague's condition?<eos> I'm unable to deduce without a firsthand examination.<eos> I must see Mr. Scott myself.<eos> Which I am unable to do.<eos> Unless-unless signed out by a legal guardian who must be, once again, a relative.<eos> What are you asking me to-<eos> No. Guardian?<eos> No, forget it.<eos> - He'll do it.<eos> - No, I will not.
- I do. Then, don't do it.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> What's up?<eos> I just thought I'd try you.<eos> I'm thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.<eos> - I don't know what I'm gonna do!<eos> - Please call me back.<eos> - I'm not gonna be OK.<eos> - You will.
All right.<eos> Well, I was right.<eos> They're all in their hibernation pods.<eos> - Where?<eos> - There's chambers in the aft section.<eos> The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.<eos> What?<eos> The normal procedure would be to leave crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in, there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.<eos> So if we do not wake them...<eos> - Then they never will.
What? The rocket's mine,numb-nuts.<eos> Wait up.<eos> Deviated my septum,little bastard.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Still whistles when I breathe. Got your asses kicked by a couple 12-year-olds?<eos> Seth wanted that rocket real bad.<eos> He was crazy enough to take us on for it.<eos> Hey,I was honest with y.That's got to be worth something,right?<eos> Right.We'll get back to you,Malcolm.<eos> No,you won't.
We all do.<eos> This isn't waco.<eos> They stay for now...<eos> While i pray for god's guidance. Please don't try to force us out.<eos> No one's gonna try to force you out of here.<eos> Trust me. Trust is earned.<eos> It is.<eos> Tell them i'm not crazy.<eos> Tell them i'm just a man living by god's law.<eos> I will.
I lost my older sister in a car crash.<eos> And it was really hard on our family because she was the responsible one.<eos> She was the one that my mother always counted on to watch over us.<eos> And when she died, my mother wouldn't let the police in.<eos> If she didn't let them in, then my sister wasn't really dead.<eos> This man is a monster, and we can catch him.<eos> But we need your daughter's help.<eos> - If you accuse her of anything...<eos> - Ma'am- i will be on the phone so fast...<eos> - Ma'am, ma'am, we won't.
Some of it was on-line, and some of it was just an educated guess based on birth order.<eos> A guess. And in the process, you lied.<eos> That mother was shut down. I needed to salvage some rapport.<eos> I don't know how you did things in counter-terrorism, But we don't make it a habit to lie to get the job done.<eos> I got you in the door, didn't i?<eos> Not only do you represent the fbi, you represent this team-- To the press, the police, and to the families who are struggling with some of the hardest times of their lives.<eos> If you get caught in a lie, the trust we depend on to help solve these crimes disappears.<eos> Do i make myself clear?<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - No, it won't.
Yeah. Something like that.<eos> Maybe the words people said under their breaths Weren't so kind.<eos> Call me crazy,but when a perfectly healthy,bright, But underachieving 29-Year-Old suddenly keels over, I smell...<eos> Drugs.<eos> I haven't seen the result of the tox report, But they're saying it was an overdose.<eos> Grace,don't do this.<eos> We don't have anything to feel guilty about.<eos> We know what we did.<eos> I have to scrub up, but we'll talk.<eos> No,we won't, not about this.
Nothing is ever going to be the same.<eos> Remember what you used to tell me when i had a bad day or i didn't do well?<eos> You would always say that the only thing that mattered to you is that you knew i tried my best.<eos> That's what i need you to do.<eos> I need you to try to be ok.<eos> For me.<eos> She wants you to try.<eos> Just like you used to tell her to do.<eos> She needs you to promise that you'll at least try.<eos> I will, sweet girl.
Well, a last-minute plane ticket is expensive.<eos> - Wait. Where are you?<eos> - Somewhere in Spain.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Slow song.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> - It's Barney.<eos> - So?<eos> For all the years Heather's been visiting New York, Ted's never let Barney meet her.<eos> And I never will.
Mom, why do you have this cello in your closet?<eos> That's where I keep my cello.<eos> You don't play cello.<eos> Well, tell that to the cello.<eos> You are such a bad liar.<eos> This is one of my Christmas gifts, isn't it?<eos> No, why would I give you my cello?<eos> Then what am I gonna play?<eos> Okay, then. Play me something.<eos> Okay, I will.
she wanted white lilac.<eos> Now I've got $3000 bucks worth of purple trees sitting in my truck, but hey, she's paying.<eos> I guess.<eos> So... you talk to sadie lately?<eos> We're not really, no, I mean, not in a few weeks.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, sure, everything's great, you know.<eos> I'm kinda keeping my distance these days. She'S... got a lot on her plate.<eos> You could say that.<eos> then I will.
Yes!<eos> So now you know.<eos> Now you [bleep]ing know!<eos> And you'll do well to keep your filthy mouth shut about it.<eos> Keep your mouth shut, or we'll lose everything.<eos> Of course, master.<eos> Of course. You can trust me.<eos> l-l won't tell anyone.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
And you'll do well to keep your filthy mouth shut about it.<eos> Keep your mouth shut, or we'll lose everything.<eos> Of course, master.<eos> Of course. You can trust me.<eos> l-l won't tell anyone.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.<eos> Die, you piece of [bleep].<eos> [ bones cracking ] That's right.<eos> You won't.
And what makes it even worse is that even deeper down, you're sick of this--<eos> This,uh,grudge that you guys are carrying on, and you really, really miss your brother.<eos> You know,tommy,i really wanted to be pregnant.<eos> And i would--i would think-- i would think, well,h-how do people like trish just go out,<eos> They don't even want kids, they have a one-night stand, and e's immediately pregnant.<eos> And of course i'm, you know,i'm very grateful that she's bringing our baby into the world, Just as you're grateful to kevin,but it-- it's just that-- That little part of you that--that thinks it's not fair.<eos> Maybe you do understand.<eos> Eh,just,you know...<eos> Yeah,but,uh,you won't-- you won't say anything, will you?<eos> - Oh,i won't if you won't.
Who deserves this more than you?<eos> I have wanted this practically my whole life.<eos> You will totally rock at it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not like Nick denies himself anything when it comes to his career.<eos> Word.<eos> Come on, Lisa.<eos> Think of yourself for a change.<eos> Nick can never find out about this.<eos> He never will.
Wake up, donkeys.<eos> The Internet is where it's at, and I'm going to be an Internet sensation.<eos> You're totally right.<eos> If you don't mind, I'm going to come with you.<eos> Maybe I can throw Green Man into a couple of your videos, you know, and work it out.<eos> That'll get a lot of hits.<eos> You can help me out, Charlie, but we're not going to put Green - Man into anything.<eos> - Well, we'll see about that.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Well, we will.
Oh, baby, and you were so happy.<eos> That's true.<eos> Seeing those bodies every day was an epiphany for me.<eos> Mm. Well, that epiphany cost $867.42. What?<eos> That's when my father realized epiphanies are expensive.<eos> Epiphanies are expensive.<eos> Then he had another epiphany.<eos> I'm never going to get that money back.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> I will?
Oh, am I crazy or is it actually getting cooler?<eos> About time.<eos> You sure you're okay? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was the right thing.<eos> You know, i, uh... I-i'm--i'm sorry.<eos> I cannot believe that Nate Archibald is a gigolo.<eos> You cannot tell anyone, remember?<eos> Hey, who would I tell?<eos> Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met?<eos> I won't. I won't.
And millicent is moving to be with mouth, And peyton with lucas and they're all moving forward.<eos> And it's like I am stuck here, standing still, and<eos> Brooke, you're 22 years old and the founder Of a multi-million-dollar corporation.<eos> I'd hardly call that standing still.<eos> But it's gone.<eos> You'll do something else.<eos> You're intelligent, you're creative.<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> Right. but what if I don't figure it out?<eos> You will.
I just got a call from my agent.<eos> Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book.<eos> Luke, for The Comet?<eos> That's great.<eos> No, actually. Not for The Comet, but Ravens.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> Slashers!<eos> - You up for this?<eos> - Not if it's gonna put me in a wheelchair.<eos> - They won't.
You knew how to tell him to read before checking with me.<eos> Ari, you've got to get gus to do you a favor and see him.<eos> A favor to cover up your fuck up or a favor for vince?<eos> For vince. He needs this right now.<eos> He might not be showing it, but he's hurting.<eos> That sucks, but there are certain realities We need to face up to in this life.<eos> And one of them is that vince ain't getting in a gus van sant movie.<eos> Will you call gus back?<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> - Fine, then I fucking will.
- The 2nd of July?<eos> Whatever Scudder was warning us about is going to happen the day after tomorrow?<eos> That'd explain his urgency.<eos> - We have to contact Captain Kell.<eos> - There's nothing we can do tonight.<eos> I'll telephone the Bureau first thing in the morning.<eos> Well, I suppose we should try to get some sleep.<eos> - I'll take the floor.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you won't, Hannay.
Fractured cheek, broken nose...<eos> - left nut swinging solo.<eos> - Yes, it was beautiful!<eos> Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing.<eos> Any luck up north?<eos> Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere.<eos> Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.<eos> We'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning.<eos> We'll get our guns back.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
- I'll pay for him. - Everything?<eos> . - Another beer?<eos> . - No, thanks.<eos> What's up?<eos> I tried calling her.<eos> She hung up on me.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> She won't.
He'll bring us some gas.<eos> You didn't go along?<eos> Should I have left you alone?<eos> I hope he comes soon.<eos> When he comes, pay him ten liras more.<eos> I didn't have enough.<eos> You already paid him?<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> He's not going to run away with the money.<eos> Of course he will, stupid!
Ah. Don't worry. I tend to have that effect on women, Belle, eh?<eos> No. Actually, no. I can't do it.<eos> Put your head between your legs.<eos> Have a glass of water.<eos> I'm not dizzy.<eos> I'm just not gonna have sex with you.<eos> You're a prostitute, for God's sake!<eos> She's new.<eos> Fine. I'll do everything but have sex.<eos> So will my wife.
But you know, Dad can't have another Pocock on the team.<eos> - Karl!<eos> - Yes? Why don't you go upstairs and I'll make us a cup of tea.<eos> Oh...<eos> Right. See you misfits later.<eos> Poor you.<eos> You must feel awful. - I do.<eos> - Oh, come here.<eos> You know, I'm really pleased for Karl. But I do hope that this doesn't turn him into a prize cock.<eos> Probably will.
Mr D'Urberville whistled to them this morning, ma'am.<eos> No wonder they're subdued.<eos> Pretty airs are what's needed, Tess.<eos> Can you manage it, do you think?<eos> Damn and blast it!<eos> Was there ever a more beautiful sight on God's earth, Tess, than watching you whistle?<eos> I could stand here all day watching you - pouting and swearing to yourself.<eos> - I did not swear!<eos> - Perhaps I will give you a lesson...<eos> - No, you will not!
Izz, I'm going to Brazil... alone.<eos> I have separated from Tess for personal reasons.<eos> I see.<eos> I thought as much.<eos> Would you go with me... instead of her?<eos> - You truly wish me to go?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
You have some 'time?<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> - Remind yourself that are out of head...<eos> - One of the two of us must be by force.<eos> But when he speaks to open a po ', leave to enter the light...<eos> - Forget that stuff.<eos> - Why '? Why 'Your husband thinks only to money?<eos> - That 'in Parliament...<eos> - I do not know what I am talking about.<eos> I will '.
And at the cost of her own life.<eos> You must find her, Logan. Before it's too late.<eos> I will.<eos> I don't think we're alone.<eos> -How'd you get in here? ! -Hm.<eos> Well, you know the security code and I'm telepathic.<eos> You tell me.<eos> We don't need spies in the X-Men, Frost.<eos> You're out of here as of now! -You'll need my assistance.<eos> -No, I won't!
You're holding out on me!<eos> I- - I was delayed.<eos> I ran out of time.<eos> What is more important than earning your keep? !<eos> I have a friend.<eos> As if anyone would care about a thieving reject like you.<eos> He says I am more than just a thief.<eos> And he fills your head with lies! Who is he?<eos> Tell me!<eos> -I will not!
I seem to remember Magneto doesn't even want you near his island.<eos> I mean, how can he not be impressed after I blew up the MRD archives?<eos> Plus, wait till he sees Nitro.<eos> Okay, we are finished.<eos> What happened?<eos> I-I feel sick.<eos> You're going to be fine.<eos> We were able to shut down your powers.<eos> So I think things will finally be different for you.<eos> No, they won't.
Not after I talk to the state attorney and tell them that you coerced evidence unlawfully.<eos> Assault and battery.<eos> You beat me up to get what you needed.<eos> You stole my shoelace.<eos> Nice try, Ron.<eos> Well, that bruise should show up about the same time as the state attorney, I would say, don't you ?<eos> Now, Horatio, tell me.<eos> Are they gonna believe me, or are they gonna blame a cop who got extradited to brazil for killing a man ?<eos> Just remember what I said, Ron.<eos> I will.
Just marry me.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is the play over?<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Well, then I'm out of here.<eos> Hang on, hang on, hang on a second, hang on.<eos> - Is it a yes, or...?<eos> - Is it a yes?<eos> Really, Charlie, will I marry you?<eos> No, no, I will not.
I know nobody likes him but me, but I do love him!<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I'm sure you'll both be very, very happy.<eos> You are so good!<eos> Could I ask you something more?<eos> Anything.<eos> Papa will miss me so much, I know.<eos> Will you keep him company?<eos> Only when you can spare the time, and Mama too, there is no-one they like so much, or trust so much.<eos> Of course I will.
- Shall we ask for someone else?<eos> No. A communist who survives police headquarters must have excellent references!<eos> - Fernando Borgia, Deputy Public Prosecutor.<eos> - Commissioner Scialoja.<eos> - Pleased to meet you, Canton.<eos> - What have we got?<eos> There were at least 2 cars.<eos> No prints but no bloodshed.<eos> We've tapped the phones in case they call.<eos> They will.
Within half a day of your departure, Mistress Fanshawe was arrested.<eos> She's charged with robbery and murder.<eos> - They will hang me!<eos> - Lies cannot hang you.<eos> This was done to attack me, why else?<eos> Thomas, a word.<eos> - You must not tell him.<eos> - I killed a thief.<eos> - Will he not understand?<eos> - No, he will not.
And sad.<eos> My head...<eos> Won-Kyun!<eos> Sell the ox!<eos> Sell what ox?<eos> Why keep it when it's so much trouble?<eos> I do all the work, not you.<eos> Will you stop talking like that?<eos> Sell it.<eos> I won't.
I'm not a kid any more.<eos> I'll be your pusher, for free, anything...<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I've not been a kid for some time now.<eos> - Get rid of the body.<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Let her go?<eos> - What if she goes to the cops?<eos> She won't.
That device has been discredited for years.<eos> Well, check their Web site.<eos> It's still used in 1400 state and local agencies.<eos> Well, not in Las Vegas.<eos> Or anywhere else in this state.<eos> Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession ?<eos> He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.<eos> Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.<eos> He tell you why he did it ?<eos> No, but he will.
- Honey, that's the grief talking.<eos> - I want the surgery today.<eos> Well, there are no other clinical trials out there.<eos> No one else has any answers.<eos> - Dr. Shepherd has worked hard on this.<eos> - Meredith. We're not letting you have surgery because you want to die with Jeremy.<eos> If I go home, I die.<eos> I die in a few weeks, a few days.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Mom, you won't.
Yes?<eos> Caden asked me to give you this.<eos> You're to keep it in all the time.<eos> /So touched by the sadness /of Adele's neighbor /so close to death.<eos> /Say, "Thank you," /to Adele's neighbor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome, young lady.<eos> /Now say, "Have a very good day."<eos> Have a very good day.<eos> I will indeed.
That's the way i am.<eos> - It's my fault.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What ever happens you always will be her father.<eos> I know.<eos> Like you always will be my son.<eos> Yes.<eos> Forgive me, please forgive me.<eos> - I think you should go.<eos> - Yes, i will.
Red, stay away from the window!<eos> World, here I come.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Guess we're out.<eos> Hey, Hellboy, over here.<eos> East Side Railyards,midnight<eos> Your Royal Highness.<eos> Prince Nuada you honor us with your return<eos> Before entering the council chamber, you must surrender your weapon.<eos> I will not.
There are drugs to render your bones so brittle that a wrong twist getting out of your chair will do the trick.<eos> Or you can puncture your vertebrae with a four-inch spinal needle.<eos> But there's one path to paralysis that excites a wannabe's imagination above all others.<eos> They use it to soften plastic.<eos> This is Ginger Jake.<eos> It'll paralyze your legs, your arms.<eos> If you wanna fuck yourself up, you be my guest.<eos> Okay, I'm not being a bitch, but I will give you back your shoes in little cut-up pieces of leather if you don't help me.<eos> - I'm not helping you.<eos> - You will.
You knew I was trying to get rid of you.<eos> - Yet you stayed.<eos> - Ya.<eos> I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt!<eos> But it could never hurt more than it did everyday in my life just being me.<eos> I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me, could make me, not me it was you.<eos> The greatest Kung Fu teacher of all of China.<eos> But I can change you!<eos> I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior.<eos> And I will!
Yes, but say it like Gabrielle would say it.<eos> Go on, say it.<eos> Yes?<eos> - I want you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No.<eos> Europe, I think.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
That's putting it mildly.<eos> You made Mom's night.<eos> So, you're leaving?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just think it's time I did stuff for myself.<eos> I need some distance to give me perspective or I'll go crazy if I stay here.<eos> I'll send you a postcard, okay?<eos> Tell mom and dad I love them.<eos> I will.
I can't believe I was so insistent upon bringing these... silly things.<eos> It was Fletcher who did this, wasn't it?<eos> The last thing Flynn told me before he died was that- that your husband was killed by a- by a glass-tipped spear... like the ornamental ones in the homestead.<eos> Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear. King George is from Arnhem.<eos> Fletcher was trying to make it look like King George. - Fletcher.<eos> - It can't be proved.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maitland-<eos> We can't let them win.<eos> We won't.
I hardly know her.<eos> What now?<eos> I just, I thought if I did everything... for the now, that I could forget the past... and the past is who I am.<eos> And I just, I don't... I...<eos> How am I supposed to go back to Susan if I don't know how to forgive her?<eos> Look.<eos> I'm gonna disappear.<eos> Just, look, tell them that you lost me, okay?<eos> No, Frank.<eos> No, I won't.
Kainan<eos> There's another one!<eos> Kainan!<eos> everyone's leaving.<eos> Eric, it's not safe here anymore.<eos> Everyone's going to the boats.<eos> You need to go, too.<eos> But, I want to stay here with you.<eos> You'll come back soon.<eos> Everyone will.
- Thank you.<eos> - You don't have to thank me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> The Joker won.<eos> Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for undone.<eos> Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation.<eos> We bet it all on him.<eos> The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.<eos> People will lose hope.<eos> They won't.
- Give you a hand.<eos> - Dumbass.<eos> - Help me push it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - It's fucking strong.<eos> - Is it?<eos> I'll be in touch, Rico.<eos> - Tell the boys I said, "What's up?"<eos> - I will.
What's that sticky stuff called?<eos> - Duct tape.<eos> - Yes, duct tape.<eos> I love duct tape.<eos> Besides, what was I in Inkheart?<eos> The Adderhead's henchman. Living in the woods with all those filthy beasts.<eos> But look at me now.<eos> I've got a castle.<eos> I'll never go back.<eos> None of us ever will.
Darling, I missed you.<eos> What happened?<eos> I missed it.<eos> I missed it.<eos> They're all gone.<eos> I got here too late to go home.<eos> He'll never read me back in now.<eos> He said he'd try.<eos> After he got his wife back.<eos> Well, he won't.
I'm not afraid of her. You need to be afraid of her. You don't watch Wild Kingdom?<eos> You ain't never seen a lion attack a gazelle? She about to smack the CoverGirl off your face. You better get up out of here.<eos> 'Scoe. 'Scoe.<eos> Hey, look, man... Let him go.<eos> Get off of me, Reggie!<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I can see your spine. Look at that snake!<eos> It was so good to see you, Jamaal.<eos> Yeah. Don't you forget to stay in touch with your grandma and grandpa, you hear?<eos> I will.
What's to like?<eos> Oh, come on, what does that mean?<eos> There's plenty to like.<eos> Such as?<eos> You can really hold your liquor.<eos> Sarcasm will get you everywhere.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> is this pointless?<eos> Am I ever going to have another chance with Cristabel?<eos> Oh...yeah. Of course you will.
Yeah.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Did you Id the girl from the apartment?<eos> Her name is Ana Llorca, worked for a local pizza place.<eos> Apparently made a few deliveries to his address.<eos> We also found a jeep registered under the name Roberto Rosa.<eos> We are trying to locate it now.<eos> We're not sure if he keeps it on the island or the mainland to get from one crime scene to the next.<eos> It's a lot of ground to cover but we'll fucking find him, Tom.<eos> - No, you won't.
When are you coming back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, there's something I want you to have.<eos> But the Mach 5's your car.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Look, Speed one day, people might say things about me.<eos> But no matter what they say I just...<eos> Look, I hope you never believe them.<eos> I won't.
A hotel called La Perla de las Dunas in the desert.<eos> Thank you, Felix.<eos> James, move your ass.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> Just what we agreed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The slide's caught.<eos> Maybe you should check your own.<eos> I will.
When you're all here.<eos> Twice a year.<eos> Can I have some paper towels?<eos> Max spilled yogurt on the couch.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> Take out the cake.<eos> If Mom weren't here, would you still stay?<eos> Tend to the house?<eos> If you keep it.<eos> We will, for the children.
Yes, yes, I know, I know. I know it's a girl.<eos> Wait, Charlie.<eos> I'll give you a star.<eos> Is it your father?<eos> No, no.<eos> Who is it then?<eos> Don't worry, mum.<eos> It's someone from school.<eos> Are you going to let them in?<eos> Yes, mum, I will.
Wait.<eos> Wait. Your cell phone.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Connection lost.<eos> Connection lost.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - We're gonna stay here till after dark.<eos> - No, no, they're gonna come after us.<eos> They won't.
Ron,I gotta call you back.<eos> - Angie?<eos> - Hi,it's Angie.<eos> I know. I know. So,any news?<eos> Well,I peed on one of those stick thingies,and it said yes.<eos> Angie,that is just the greatest news!<eos> That's just unbelievably great.<eos> Thank you so much,Angie.<eos> If you need anything,anything at all,you let me know,okay?<eos> Yeah,okay. I will.
I already dίd the first floor.<eos> I can't go back uρ . Do you have Jackίe's cell number?<eos> No , I never ρut ίt ίn my ρhone .<eos> I didn't want anythίng to tie her to me . Qh' God!<eos> Come on!

Skeeter Bronson, the handyman from the other day.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Listen, uh, I got some kids with me right now.<eos> My nephew and niece.<eos> But, I gotta fix your father's TV. - Could you watch them for a few minutes? - Huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Mr. Nottingham, sir?<eos> - Uh, the telly won't turn on.<eos> It won't?
Why are they doing this?<eos> Maybe they're preparing for something. Like a sacrifice.<eos> It has something to do with the ruins.<eos> Now that we're here, they won't let us leave.<eos> So, what do we do, just wait for someone to find us?<eos> Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
Shit! Shit!<eos> What do I do?<eos> - Calm down!<eos> Pull over.<eos> What if he saw us go by before to the Pioneer?<eos> He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one.<eos> Just keep your mouth shut.<eos> What if he searches the car?<eos> What do we say about...<eos> He won't!
Freeze to death.<eos> Greg?<eos> You stoned again?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> No, no!<eos> No, I promise!<eos> I promise I won't tell!<eos> Please, please, please, please!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I won't... please!
Up close, as close as ginsburg's mole.<eos> Did you see her making eyes at me?<eos> Oh, she was hot for me.<eos> What woman isn't?<eos> It's my curse.<eos> You know, I was thinking about what you said about mercy.<eos> I sometimes wonder whether that'll be part of my legacy.<eos> I mean, will someone stand up at my funeral and say,<eos> "that man had mercy in his heart"?<eos> I will.
–Let me finish!<eos> Who are you looking to protect?<eos> My investigators have seen you with Ms Strickland.<eos> Hey, you want to go after me, sweetheart?<eos> Take your shot.<eos> I will go after you if you have broken the law.<eos> Your honor, this law is about imposing a morality.<eos> What's more, it doesn't work.<eos> Prostitution exists.<eos> It always will.
Shirley, now it is good that we oppose.<eos> First, it will offset any fallout this firm will get for representing perceived traitors.<eos> Second, what they're doing is wrong.<eos> Whatever one's problems with America...<eos> You should be telling Alan to withdraw, not Denny and me.<eos> Who's arguing?<eos> I am.<eos> But, Denny, you specifically came to me and—<eos> For backup.<eos> I'll first chair.
Some of my crew has been dealing with... what might best be described as a heightened case of cabin fever.<eos> I think it's got something to do with the close proximity of the island.<eos> Why don't you turn around, then?<eos> I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board, and he's done one hell of a job on my engines.<eos> I've got my crew working around the clock to repair them.<eos> And then you'll take our people home?<eos> Then we move to safer waters.<eos> Those are my orders.<eos> And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?<eos> Sure, I will.
- It's bad molar contact.<eos> You see, Dentist, in life, I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.<eos> Bad molar contact?<eos> I mean, is it really very serious?<eos> - You should come and see me.<eos> - Should I?<eos> - You have to finish it for me. - Yeah.<eos> There's a 38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.<eos> You just give him two in the head. Leave the gun on the floor.<eos> - Maybe I will.
Do you understand me?<eos> -No.<eos> Why?<eos> -Riley, listen to your mother.<eos> Don't repeat the address to anyone.<eos> -Kate, what are you doing?<eos> -You've gotta promise me, Riley.<eos> Please, promise me you won't repeat the address to anyone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.
I'll do it.<eos> I'll burn out his vocal cords.<eos> No, let your father handle this.<eos> Come here, Will.<eos> Kate....<eos> Kate....<eos> What if she's pregnant, Will?<eos> What if right now this genetic mutant's seed is joining with Riley's beautiful, young egg and his spawn is growing inside our daughter's belly?<eos> I am the decider, Will, and I am telling you, shut this serial-killing son of a bitch up.<eos> I will.
Rinne, you don't have to count the rocks.<eos> Try to see beyond the landscape.<eos> Try to see it your unique way.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> This is an oyster catcher eating a ladybug.<eos> This is like the cycle of nature and the cruel sea combined.<eos> The cruel sea?<eos> Simola will become a writer one day.<eos> Don't let her see you.<eos> - She won't.
That war, it's still taking its toll.<eos> Wars never end.<eos> Just...<eos> Just the lives of the soldiers who fight them.<eos> She's panting awfully hard.<eos> She does that all day long.<eos> Bulldogs have respiratory problems.<eos> You should really have her checked out.<eos> Problems, really?<eos> Well, I will.
Yeah, that's me.<eos> Can you kill him?<eos> They said you can kill the Master, can you?<eos> Tell us you can do it, please.<eos> THEY SPEAK OVER EACH OTHER<eos> Come on, leave her alone...<eos> she's exhausted.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> They want me to talk.<eos> And I will.
Robin, please.<eos> If you love me, you will let him go.<eos> I do love you.<eos> And that's why I can't let him live.<eos> Because one day he'd do something that would take you away from me.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Please, don't taint us with his blood.<eos> You owe me your life.<eos> Don't you EVER betray me!<eos> I won't.
ROBIN LAUGHS What was his name?<eos> Thomas. "Thomas"?<eos> And, yes, this is for him.<eos> I've waited for this moment.<eos> I've imagined it so many different ways.<eos> Meeting you.<eos> Killing you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, I hope it lives up to expectation.<eos> It will.
You're gonna owe them so much money.<eos> I don't even care.<eos> You are one cool customer.<eos> And that just pisses you off, doesn't it?<eos> - Yeah, it does...<eos> - You wanna shoot me, don't you?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> - Well why don't you do it then?<eos> - Think I won't?<eos> - 'Cause I will.
When I... when I was leaving,when I was... when I asked you to give me a reason to stay, you chickened out,which I-I get.<eos> I get that.It was a lot.<eos> It was scary,and I-I know I can be kinda intense, but I thought... I thought... oh!<eos> I thought after the... the chickening out part,I thought... you would come for me.<eos> I came back for you,which basically... makes me a beggar.<eos> I'm a beggar for halloween.<eos> And now you're mocking me.<eos> I'm not mocking you.<eos> We need... to talk.<eos> We will.
Lots of kids commute to and from school.<eos> Christ!<eos> Watch where you're going.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - She could at least help tidy up.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Dad, I didn't want the shelf there.<eos> - Too late.<eos> - Or do it yourself.<eos> - Fine, I will!
I wasn't planning on it,no.<eos> Look,I'm an addict,okay?<eos> Lying is second nature to me.<eos> But it is selfish,and it is easy, and in the end,people get hurt.<eos> Okay,maybe it'll take a year or two years, or in my dad's case 20 years,but you know what?<eos> The truth always comes out.<eos> I'm not your dad.<eos> Come clean with sarah and do what he couldn'T.O?<eos> if i donn't<eos> Then I will.
Twenty minutes ago, you weren't even going, and now you're telling Jack... I didn't want to go with you.<eos> Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.<eos> I know where there are some guns.<eos> There's a hidden cache a couple miles from here.<eos> I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.<eos> Juliet, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - Don't do anything stupid.<eos> - l won't if you won't.
Your task force doesn't need my help railroading a good cop.<eos> Doakes was officially a person of interest.<eos> Not reporting that call could be aiding and abetting.<eos> None of you wanted to hear what he had to say, so I didn't tell you.<eos> - What did he have to say?<eos> - That he's innocent.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> What do you think?<eos> And if he calls again?<eos> He won't.
It's over now.<eos> They're safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> You two, secure a perimeter, and have the fire chief see me as soon as he gets here, OK?<eos> Put out an APB on Lila West, AKA Lila Tournay, suspected arsonist - Five-seven, black hair, pale like a fucking corpse.<eos> "Fucking corpse." Got it.<eos> You're wasting your time. She's not coming back, not after this.<eos> - Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> - No, she won't.
You're actually doing it.<eos> You're really communicating with him.<eos> But what's a church and an old room supposed to tell me?<eos> Maybe there's more to the message.<eos> I tried and got nothing.<eos> Stephen's finally ready to listen and I'm letting him down.<eos> When my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardens at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.<eos> He always told me I could do anything if I just believed.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> You won't.
- You can't.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> You can't.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Tom, I'll go.<eos> Leon Cushman's out there from the Post, okay?<eos> I have a relationship with him;<eos> I'll talk to him alone. Tell him to fix it.<eos> Tell him to tell everybody else.<eos> I will.
They may be too...<eos> I want them to be right.<eos> - Well, let's hear them.<eos> - What?<eos> Now? Got a room full of women.<eos> Try 'em out on us.<eos> "Cristina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you.<eos> I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.<eos> I could say, "Till death do us part. "'<eos> But I won't.
All you've got, at the end of the day in this army... is your word.<eos> So you aren't gonna fight for your career?<eos> No.<eos> You also have a marriage.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm asking you as your wife simply to obey the law and to obey your superiors.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> If you can't fight for your career, then why should I fight for our marriage?<eos> - [Beeping] - Hang up that phone.<eos> I will not.
108.<eos> You're 108? Yeah.<eos> This guy has been calling for you for the past hour.<eos> He asked me to go to your room and knock on the door, but I told him it's against hotel policy.<eos> He's a very pushy man.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If you break it, you have to buy it. Excuse me.<eos> Front desk.<eos> Please hold, sir.<eos> No, sir, I will not.
I can't believe we're doing this in a patient's room.<eos> It's about to get hotter.<eos> Yyyyes!<eos> - Turk, you are full of surprises.<eos> - Isn't he though?<eos> And what are you doing here?<eos> - He's here to kill you.<eos> - Kill me?<eos> Elliott won't let you get away with it.<eos> Sure I will.
Just me.<eos> 'Cause you know, I'm not looking for a gang bang.<eos> It's just me...<eos> One short, cuddly 20-something.<eos> Just what you say you wanted.<eos> Be at Cafee Primo on Sunset in 30.<eos> Wear a red hat.<eos> If I like what I see, I'll say hi.<eos> And if you don't?<eos> Then I won't.
That's interesting.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - He showed up at my house today.<eos> Wanted that information I gave you weeks ago.<eos> - Ben's Mexican contacts? - Yeah.<eos> Said he's working on some hush-hush case.<eos> Nothing I know about.<eos> I gave you those contacts on the Q.T.<eos> If they find out I was funnelling money to him...<eos> No, they won't.
I'm tired.<eos> We need to rest.<eos> I'm going to sit down.<eos> It's dirty!<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The stool is old.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You can't stay on that stool!<eos> -You're gonna fall over, Grandma!<eos> - No, I won't... Grandad!
Of course, we'll have updates for you as events unfold.<eos> Bryce Larkin was CIA, Graham.<eos> He was one of your agents.<eos> -And it was NSA's job to find him.<eos> To question him, not to kill him.<eos> Thanks to Rambo here, we've got nothing.<eos> No, you got a dead CIA agent.<eos> That's gold star in my book.<eos> -lf this gets out--<eos> -It won't.
- You know what?<eos> We could've had a really great weekend, Sam.<eos> And then you had to get all caught up in your head and make it weird.<eos> No!<eos> I don't think it's weird. It's the opposite.<eos> It's not weird.<eos> - Yes, it feels weird.<eos> Listen, you're like my best friend, ok?<eos> I really don't want things to change.<eos> And they won't!
Andi.<eos> So you're finally making your move, huh?<eos> No.<eos> I tried.<eos> She, uh, she said she couldn't accept it.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We're kinda in this weird limbo thing right now.<eos> She's acting like it never happened.<eos> Ah, maybe it never will.
We need to talk.<eos> What's that?<eos> D.N.A. Results.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> What the hell have you done?<eos> I found out what i needed to know.<eos> I found out the only way that i could given the fact that my wife doesn't tell me the truth.<eos> So... so you know?<eos> I haven't read the results.<eos> I won't.
I've been looking at this in my office all day.<eos> You bought a bike?<eos> Yeah,it's custom built,it's from italy,and allan is never getting his hands on it,ever.<eos> I don't care if it costs $6,000.<eos> You bought allan a $6,000 bike?<eos> I-I ordered it last year.<eos> It just arrived today... on his birthday.<eos> Brutal.<eos> Why don't you sell it?<eos> yeah. Yeah,maybe I will.
Brutal.<eos> Why don't you sell it?<eos> yeah. Yeah,maybe I will.<eos> Or give it away.Just-- great.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm gonna give it away.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You will not give allan that bike.<eos> I won't?
The woman allan dumped you for cami?<eos> he didn't dump me.<eos> He just married her right after he left me.<eos> What the hell is she doing with naomi?<eos> Cami davis is a patient here?<eos> You should ask naomi.<eos> What is cami davis here for?<eos> You should ask naomi.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna hug Digby and pretend that he's you.<eos> the pie maker was saddened that chuck could hold Digby while he had no one,<eos> - save the waitress, - ? who he now realized he did not want to hold.<eos> Not in that way.<eos> Olive?<eos> Still here.<eos> I'm sorry I've been avoiding you, and I'm sorry i said our saliva wasn't compatible. I'm a big girl.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> I know you will.<eos> Will you?
Why don'tyou just fuck off?<eos> Come on.What do you think?<eos> In your heart or hearts,what's your best guess?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> How's uncle charlie?<eos> I just came byto say goodnight to our little courtney lovein training.<eos> Well, she went to celebratewith her bandmates.<eos> Will you please tell her that I will call herfirst thing in the morning.<eos> Yes, I will.
Hang on a second.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> I'm probably gonna be home in, like, two hours.<eos> It's my boyfriend.<eos> - That steak was amazing.<eos> - Yeah, what do you season it with?<eos> I'll never tell.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You'll tell me.<eos> No, seriously, I won't.
John Chase...<eos> Is that Vinnie Chase I see in that car?<eos> - Hi, how are you?<eos> - I'm Turtle.<eos> Vinnie, I am a big fan. Big, big fan.<eos> My kids, they're just obsessed with Aquaman.<eos> My daughter cried when they replaced you in the sequel.<eos> Said she will not see it no matter how good it is.<eos> - Tell her thank you. - I will.<eos> I will.
You said "violent episodes".<eos> Yes.<eos> What if he has one?<eos> There's not a lot you can do about it, is there?<eos> -Under the circumstances.<eos> -Please. Could you just sit over there?<eos> What if he hurts someone?<eos> If he's as bad as you say... -He is.<eos> -What if he kills someone?<eos> -He won't.
- We're still on that dinosaur thing?<eos> What, is there an echo in here?<eos> Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.<eos> We step foot on the far end of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai and he starts blasting us with buckshot.<eos> We know our dead guy was there every night leading up to his death, digging around the periphery of this property.<eos> No, Shawn, wait.<eos> I don't want you borrowing my tools.<eos> Oh, Gus will leave his class ring as collateral.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> - Yes, you will. - No, I won't.
I also believe you're patriots, - but the fact is...<eos> - What? ...the fact is something had to be...<eos> Screw friendship, screw honor, screw patriotism.<eos> We just lost the franchise!<eos> Oh, please.<eos> The show's been on for 15 years.<eos> It's had like eight head writers, a couple of hundred staff writers-- it'll be fine.<eos> Studio 60 is a restaurant with a good location.<eos> Give him a couple of days-- he'll come back.<eos> No, he won't.
- What is it?<eos> I have a virus.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> I can't make you or anybody else sick.<eos> - What's gonna happen to you?<eos> - Do you remember Dr Suresh?<eos> He is working really hard to find me a cure.<eos> And, when he does, I'll get better.<eos> - Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
I can already tell you're gonna do quite well for yourself in this town.<eos> That's right, which means we don't need to see you or your sicko clients any longer.<eos> Have you seen today's variety?<eos> This sicko has just climbed up another rung on the ladder.<eos> "Bob easton named c.e.o. After merger."<eos> He told me he was leaving town.<eos> I guess the rush of power's just too addictive to walk away from.<eos> Call me.<eos> I don't need your kind of help.<eos> You will.
Is that right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She needed some stability.<eos> I... I guess I was it.<eos> Anyway, we're keeping the business together.<eos> Beyond that, I'd rather just stay out of this.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're a key witness.<eos> You can tell the jury about all the harassment, the stalking.<eos> And I will.
- My father.<eos> Yes.<eos> I tried to contact him to interview him for my book.<eos> He passed away.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Well, uh, Lee Jay, it's time.<eos> You're on.<eos> - Catch you later, Mick.<eos> - Yeah, you will.
How am I supposed to do that?<eos> Just turn on the Mick st. John charm.<eos> What girl could resist?<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> If Morgan is Coraline-- and I'm not saying she is.<eos> If-- and she realizes that you suspect her, I don't know what she'll do.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> But one way or another,<eos> I will finally find out the truth.<eos> We both will.
Clear the set, please.<eos> Clear the set.<eos> Shh, shh, shh. And...<eos> Scene 84.<eos> Take 1.<eos> Action.<eos> Write to me while I am gone.<eos> I will try.<eos> Not "I will try," but "I will."<eos> I will.
You will what, Pauline?<eos> Bake him a cake?<eos> Knit him a sweater?<eos> Look, your brother here is... is asking for an emotional lifeline, okay?<eos> That's great. Fantastic, Leo.<eos> Can we take it again?<eos> Scene 84.<eos> Take 2.<eos> Not "I will try," but "I will."<eos> I will.
Remember how i followed the guy,<eos> Saw him leave the butt on his windowsill?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. It wasn't on his windowsill.<eos> Where was it?<eos> In an ashtray.<eos> ?<eos> She is so mad at me.<eos> She's never gonna forgive me.<eos> Yes,she will.
I tell you, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.<eos> Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.<eos> Honey, that ain't gonna work, but you keep tryin'.<eos> I made chicken.<eos> I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic.<eos> You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr. Patel-- Tt's a beautiful story.<eos> The Lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on Lasik-- You know, those that needed it.<eos> That is a lovely story.<eos> Are we gonna do anything about Sheldon?<eos> Oh, we will.
I specifically asked you not to.<eos> When my wife is upset, I gotta do something.<eos> You don't take your car to a mechanic, tell him what's wrong, and then say, "but don't fix it. Just listen and hug me."<eos> I should be able to share things with my husband without worrying he's gonna go do something crazy.<eos> Or you could be more amused when he does something crazy.<eos> Let's not forget about the beautiful flowers.<eos> One of which is already dead.<eos> Honey, I just want to be able to move on from this<eos> - knowing it's not gona happen again.<eos> - It won't.
kyle.<eos> I did what you said.<eos> I fought back.<eos> I know you did,son.<eos> I know you did.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm doing this,kyle... because I'm your father,okay.<eos> You...what?<eos> I know you don't believe me,and we can't talk about it now.<eos> But we will.
They were never really alive.<eos> I was doing them a favor.<eos> But that's not for you to decide,is it,Mr. Pike?<eos> Good to have you back,Mr. Wolfe.<eos> It's good to be back.<eos> You went to bat for me.<eos> I'm never going to forget that.<eos> It's in your blood,isn't it?<eos> Never forget that.<eos> I won't.
Make your own life.<eos> I have too much here.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Crisis averted?<eos> Yes. Papers were on my desk.<eos> Do you want to go visit the kids?<eos> No, I just want to go to sleep.<eos> I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want you to get upset.<eos> I won't.
Everything happens for a reason.<eos> Whoa, that's bright.<eos> Is that a chopper?<eos> No. No. That's not a searchlight.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It means you're ready to go.<eos> Tell anna I love her.<eos> Tell her not to let my little girl forget about her dad.<eos> I will.
And I know you were trying to save me.<eos> She risked her life for me.<eos> She doesn't blame you.<eos> She was really proud of you.<eos> I'm so sorry, mom.<eos> I don't know how to do any of this without you.<eos> You will always have me with you in your heart, But most importantly, you have each other.<eos> They've gotta stop punishing themselves.<eos> Please tell them that we'll always be a family, And they have to take care of each other.<eos> I will.
- I was.<eos> - Take the damn shot.<eos> Maybe your partner will talk him out of it.<eos> Henry, just let the girl go.<eos> And I'll clear everybody out, and you and I can just talk.<eos> That's a promise.<eos> It doesn't have to end like this.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> And it will.
This tube is a clue to the hidden immunity idol.<eos> You must give this to a member of this tribe before you rejoin your own.<eos> Cool. I hope it's worth it.<eos> I need something to save me. I'm in a bad spot right now.<eos> Todd is the cornerstone to all the alliances on this tribe, so I'm going to roll with todd and roll the old dice and maybe it will come up right.<eos> fei long day 18<eos> you... i..<eos> just..<eos> tell..<eos> i will.. and....
Oh, I'm sorry, I never go to Mozambique on a second date.<eos> - Kenya.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I can. I just don't know that I will.<eos> Oh, look at that. My goodness.<eos> Is that you playing hard to get?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. I'm not sure.<eos> I don't want you to do to my dad what you did to Darling Plaza, or me for that matter.<eos> I won't.
But I don't even know your last name.<eos> Well, I don't... I don't even know your last name.<eos> I'm Sofia Montoya. And you're Jeremy...<eos> I'm cool with just Jeremy, babe eson.<eos> Jeremy Babeson. Babeson?<eos> Yeah. Well, you know, it's a common American last name.<eos> It's right on all those lists beside Smith, Wong and White.<eos> Well, thank you again for the ride. And I'll see you tomorrow,<eos> Jeremy Babeson.<eos> Yes. Yes, you will.
Because I've been everywhere else first.<eos> Is "a little while" over yet?<eos> Because I can't bear the thought of you hating me still.<eos> I feel better.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> No.<eos> I thought, for one minute...<eos> I'm not gonna bring him back just so you can watch me kill him again.<eos> I can't do that to you.<eos> I won't.
And where was his home regiment?<eos> 18th infantry.<eos> "In omnia paratus."<eos> "In all things prepared."<eos> No medals,right?<eos> Ribbons,yes.Medals,no.<eos> He has a silver and bronze star.<eos> And a purple heart.<eos> And he'll be getting another purple heart?<eos> His parents will.
Let's clean up the streets.<eos> This is how it's gonna work.<eos> You're gonna walk right up to him.<eos> You're gonna kindly ask him to leave.<eos> He's gonna see me with the bat, looking tough.<eos> He's gone.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's all you need to do when you look like a badass, Dee.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Yes, It will.
It's just that this is such quick work.<eos> Martha, my dear.<eos> You cannot forge such a plan just to benefit me.<eos> Matrimony is a very solemn thing.<eos> Thank you, Miss Matilda.<eos> I've always it thought so.<eos> Then why do you object to it?<eos> I don't object as such! I daresay I shan't mind once it's done.<eos> I hope the Lord forgives you, Jem Hearne!<eos> Because I won't.
Anyone.<eos> Thank you, sir, $300.<eos> Do I hear $400? Who will say $400?<eos> Do I hear $400?<eos> Who will go $400?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have $400.<eos> Do I have $500?<eos> $500?<eos> $500, who will.
- Do you understand me?<eos> - Yeah, I'm with you.<eos> I hope so.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> OK?<eos> Glad to hear you say that.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I will definitely give Dr. Averies a call.<eos> - Have a very safe trip back.<eos> - I will.
Come downstairs.<eos> Ga-in.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> I can't stay home like this.<eos> Do you know how dangerous it is outside?<eos> What about inside?<eos> It's safe here?<eos> Mom just tried to kill me!<eos> Who knows, when you'll change too?<eos> I won't.
Good.<eos> They took the bomber alive.<eos> It's a woman.<eos> She might lead us directly to Halir._BAR_<eos> We wouldn't need Formitz anymore.<eos> - I thought you'd like to know._BAR_<eos> - Thanks.<eos> She broke?<eos> No.<eos> And she won't.
The women I love die, Tessa, Kate, all of them.<eos> I kept telling myself...<eos> I'm an Immortal. It was the price I paid.<eos> But deep down inside, I always believed that one day the light bulb would come on, and I would know why I spent the last 400 years cutting people's heads off to survive.<eos> I would know why I am what I am.<eos> Look, I haven't lived like you.<eos> I haven't seen what you've seen.<eos> I don't. But we've come this far for a reason.<eos> I won't lose you.<eos> You won't.
But we're almost there, Miranda.<eos> We are so close.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> I'm really sorry. I just wasn't thinking.<eos> You never do.<eos> Well, I'll get it back.<eos> - How are you going to do that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I will.
Nice ride.<eos> This is supposed to be fun.<eos> I got three days until the contest.<eos> I don't have time for fun.<eos> No time for fun, huh?<eos> - Hey, Cody! - What?<eos> Bring me some clams when you come back!<eos> I'm not coming back!<eos> - He'll be back.<eos> - No, I won't!
# Welcome to the sixties #<eos> # Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties # # Your mama's hip, your mama's in #<eos> # Hey, Mama # # Your mama's lookin' at herself and wonderin' "Where you been?" #<eos> # Where you been? #<eos> # Your mama's lit, she's all aglow # # Your mama, what she's holdin' back # # Your mama's gotta let go, go, go #<eos> # Welcome to the "six", to the "O" # # To the apostrophe "s" hey-yay, baby, yeah #<eos> Mmm. Wait till Dad sees you. Sees me?<eos> He never notices what I wear.<eos> In 20 years, he's never even said to me, "nice muumuu" or nothin'.<eos> Now he will.
- We don't?<eos> - Sherry calls it "the little engine."<eos> - It makes her hot all the time.<eos> - Right.<eos> Doctor told her she's got three times more blood in her and that's why she can't cool off.<eos> Kid's not even born yet, I'm already awake all night.<eos> You're lucky you don't ever have to worry about that stuff.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Remember, lock the back door.<eos> I will.
HAYTHAM: What is it? AL GHAZl:<eos> FLEURY: Reminds me of when they hit the towers, first time, in '93.<eos> You remember how they caught the cell?<eos> -Car bomb. -Yeah.<eos> He went back to get his deposit on the rental car.<eos> $400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Be serious.<eos> - I am serious.<eos> I need to know who he is.<eos> I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him.<eos> Is that more important than your family's safety?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you need to do this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because nobody else will.
Thank you, Mrs. Moran.<eos> Oh, it's not Mrs. Moran anymore.<eos> Mr. Moran and I have separated.<eos> And I need... a man.<eos> .<eos> You're in suspension.<eos> Oh, look, more children.<eos> We'll just have to finish this tonight.<eos> What?<eos> We will?
He's been asking questions about the heart.<eos> Does he know?<eos> Then perhaps his usefulness has run its course.<eos> Steady, men.<eos> Go.<eos> All of you.<eos> And take that infernal thing with you.<eos> I will not have it on my ship.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Because I will.
- Arrive hungry......<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving, Grandma! -...<eos> From Director Eli Roth Thanksgiving.<eos> You'll come home for the holidays...<eos> in a body bag. This February.<eos> Get more out of life.<eos> Go out to a movie.<eos> Hold on, I've got to come up!<eos> I've got to take the world's biggest fucking piss. - We can't be late!<eos> - We won't!
- No thanks, I quit.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - How are you gonna get home?<eos> - It's not so far to walk.<eos> - We could sleep over;<eos> - there's a spare room.<eos> - I want to go home.<eos> - Okay, I'll go too.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - But I will...
You're used to it!<eos> Used to it! Used to it!<eos> - Come on, Michal...<eos> - You are going to another school.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> - You will go.<eos> - You will go...<eos> You will go...<eos> - Just calm down...<eos> You will!
A Monday and all... pretty near Christmas.<eos> This is it!<eos> It's real this time.<eos> This is not a coincidence.<eos> I'm going to be with you, Holden.<eos> In the rye.<eos> I'll just disappear into the ink of the book.<eos> No, that won't happen.<eos> That's a non-reality.<eos> But something will...
Go !<eos> Where you goin' ?<eos> Call an ambulance !<eos> You saw what they did to Sean.<eos> You know what that would have done to Jimmy.<eos> All I can do is talk to Sal and try and make him see that.<eos> But I need your word Jimmy isn't planning anything else.<eos> You got my word.<eos> Tell your mother Sean's in my prayers.<eos> I will.
We hear everything that goes down.<eos> We'd also have a tail on you, so we'd be with you at all times.<eos> Small.<eos> Light as a feather.<eos> You're fucking kidding me.<eos> That's it? That's it.<eos> That's the risk.<eos> You just gotta find that stash house.<eos> - This can't get out.<eos> - It won't.
Holy shit, Ingrid.<eos> You're gonna have a baby sister or brother.<eos> My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.<eos> Who cares?<eos> - Do you think your mom is fuckable?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I think she's hot, your mother.<eos> I'd do her if I was gay.<eos> I might anyway, I mean, if she came on to me.<eos> She won't.
You didn't like the skins being there?<eos> Ten pair - twenty combat boots in the courtroom with me and my client.<eos> "Murder in the first degree, and for motivation, ladies and gentlemen, turn your heads to the assholes in the peanut gallery."<eos> I didn't invite nobody. They came.<eos> You didn't invite nobody means you invited somebody.<eos> You're playing at being stupid.<eos> I didn't ask them to be there, okay?<eos> You've got a "crew" in the courtroom and I'm supposed to stand up there straight-faced and tell the room the crime was not racially motivated.<eos> You can tell them whatever you want.<eos> No, I can't...and I won't.
You.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Do you want to kill me?<eos> Just go to sleep, all right?<eos> - Help me.<eos> - I can't!<eos> You can't leave me like this.<eos> I have to leave.<eos> I'll tell them it was an accident.<eos> I will.
- It's too high!<eos> He'll never make it.<eos> You did it, Crusoe!<eos> Well done, boy!<eos> He'll not be coming back, will he?<eos> I think he's meant to be on his own, dear.<eos> Not Crusoe.<eos> I meant Daddy.<eos> No, love.<eos> He'll not.
Who'd have thought you'd be in a van with "Saint Augustine's"?<eos> Just listening to the ball game!<eos> Cubs are off today.<eos> Hey, Gillie. This guy say he's in love. He come to Jamaica to find his girl.<eos> Well, see, we were supposed to get married and then she just called it off.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Just... Man, you don't have to worry, it's a long ride. It's really a long ride.<eos> It is absolutely beautiful here.<eos> Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?<eos> Like hell I will.
I've had a few but none that I could ever ask for anything, let alone money<eos> Now you want to know who the man in Vegas is but you're too polite to ask<eos> No<eos> It's not important<eos> He's my father<eos> Taught me how to play poker<eos> He had me figuring odds around the same time other kids were learning how to count<eos> He used to tell people that I thought the number that came after ten was Jack<eos> So I can ask him for money or anything, but<eos> I won't
Finding places to thicken your blood.<eos> At least slow it down.<eos> Just let the suckers do the rest.<eos> Leave us.<eos> Wanna tell me what went down?<eos> I'd rather just lie here.<eos> Let your needles and your guys do their work.<eos> It's all in the Gazette.<eos> We can hash this out later, when you're feeling up to it.<eos> We will.
Naomi studied with a palm reader for several years.<eos> She's really... She's quite good.<eos> - Larry... Thank you.<eos> - No, I mean you are.<eos> Well... You're very gifted.<eos> So...<eos> Can she look at mine?<eos> Honey, what are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't help it, I... I wanted to look.<eos> Will you?
Gramms.<eos> Where you running off to?<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mrs. Jenkins down the block called.<eos> Asked if I could read Jane Eyre to her.<eos> Jane Eyre, is it?<eos> I told my gramms I was gonna read Jane Eyre to this weird lady down the row.<eos> What if she finds out you're not?<eos> She won't.
If a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either is observed it will not go through both.<eos> If unobserved, it will.
Pledge Porkchop, please introduce yourself!<eos> Porkchop!<eos> Extra gravy.<eos> Brother Showtime, please introduce yourself.<eos> Showtime!<eos> Pledge Knucklehead, please introduce yourself.<eos> Knucklehead !<eos> Payback's a bitch, ain't it?<eos> I'll see you at Nationals.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Hey, Maya.<eos> - Hey, Monty.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> - What up, Willie?<eos> - What's up, young blood?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Old and tired, man.<eos> - That woman say this engine won't start.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, it won't.
Everything is ok?<eos> Yep, just it happens and looks a ittle excited for the race.<eos> You don't look so excited.<eos> I was just thinking, maybe you are right,<eos> maybe uncle MicheaI is not such a good guy after all.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing,really. Just the race.<eos> He likes these pep talks.<eos> He likes to win. I need to win.<eos> You will.
And I see you're still doing your stunts.<eos> Big time.<eos> Actually...<eos> Here.<eos> Peep the strategy.<eos> You're jumping the pool?<eos> Wow!<eos> Yeah, it's the real deal.<eos> You should come.<eos> Maybe I will.
Well, I appreciate the concern, but what would I do with it?<eos> Live in it of course, boss.<eos> Obviously.<eos> But where would I put it?<eos> Next to Mammy's.<eos> She really wouldn't mind when I tell her what you're doing.<eos> That's fine, but I don't think the laws of the council will allow it.<eos> I'm not a Traveller.<eos> You might have to be a Traveller to enter the Puck, boss but to live with us, all you need is not to have a house.<eos> In a week I won't.
Edith!<eos> Edith and the cougars!<eos> What?<eos> Wait, you want us to charge them to have sex with us?<eos> No. No.<eos> We charge our friends to have sex with them. - All right.<eos> - You see?<eos> Now listen.<eos> We start a little country club, okay?<eos> A "Cougar Club," if you will, right?
Have you ever constructed a bomb?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You've never constructed a bomb?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Six years ago... I, uh... I worked briefly on a study commissioned by the ATF.<eos> Nothing to do with bomb-making.<eos> Just detection, using trace paper technology.<eos> You can check it out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
Right, I'm sure he's good enough for y'all.<eos> My grandma would be good enough for them.<eos> - Ha!<eos> You'll see.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> Oh, and don't worry.<eos> I'll let y'all take pictures with our trophy.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Your trophy...<eos> We will.
- Excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Would you press 3?<eos> Is that your way of trying to quit?<eos> I could smell it from upstairs.<eos> Sorry, Mr. C.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You better tell your mom before I do.<eos> Yeah, I will.
What should I tell him?<eos> He has gone mad!<eos> Come on, let's bring Angel back home. - Come on.<eos> I love Isha.<eos> I love her very much.<eos> I felt this love one year back and only now do I believe it.<eos> Along with my daughter I also want to bring Isha home.<eos> Just think, Arush! What if..<eos> ..she finds someone else in these 7 days?<eos> She won't!
No, I can't believe you are actually suggesting that.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's clear.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> Why is it such a big problem?<eos> I see, otherwise you wouldn't be suggesting that. Here they are!<eos> Did he give you the money?<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> Mother fucker, when will he pay?<eos> - He won't.
Easy, kid.<eos> It's not your fault, okay?<eos> Why don't you go see Megan now?<eos> Come sit by me.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> I would like to take care of you a little bit longer.<eos> You know, if you think really hard, maybe you could stay longer.<eos> I love you, Davey.<eos> And I will stay with you.<eos> I will.
Look, do you have a pen?<eos> I need you to find someone.<eos> Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.<eos> - Yeah. - You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> Man, this is hard to spell.<eos> Swagger is going to go with what he knows.<eos> He'll try to track the shooter.<eos> He won't get far that way.<eos> Yes, he will.
A good thing, I suppose.<eos> But?<eos> You know how it goes with me in peacetime.<eos> Violence is the only trade I know.<eos> Peace comes, and the collegia change, as you say they must,<eos> I'll be on my arse again, won't I?<eos> Jobless, telling war stories to the rest of the drunkards.<eos> No, it's different now.<eos> You and me, we can do big things here.<eos> You will.
Our federale is neck-deep in some prison beef.<eos> Couldn't help.<eos> How did Guardo get Lem to show up at that place?<eos> Alone.<eos> And the way he died.<eos> Shit.<eos> We find Guardo...<eos> He dies the same way.<eos> Only slower.<eos> Yeah. He will.
Except Guardo's.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey. Come here.<eos> Wyms and the chief are trying to push through my retirement.<eos> I'm not sure why, but I don't have much time.<eos> - No man.<eos> - That's why you... can't get reckless. You hear me?<eos> I'm gonna need your help to finish this thing.<eos> I can't lose you, too, Shane.<eos> You won't.
Help me if you can.<eos> I can only tell you what I went through...<eos> And I've never told anyone.<eos> After your birth, I felt an unknown attraction to another woman.<eos> I was ready to leave my family.<eos> But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
I'd fuck him.<eos> - Right?<eos> - All right.<eos> So who would you fuck, unconditionally?<eos> Unconditionally...<eos> So is someone gonna say, like, "action"?<eos> - Would you like that?<eos> - If you like it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I will.
Then where is the grass?<eos> The horse ate up the grass.<eos> Then where is the horse?<eos> Why will the horse wait after eating the grass?<eos> He left, isn`t it brothers?<eos> - Yes, you are right.<eos> The horse, left we are leaving too.<eos> Bye. - Bye. - Thank you.<eos> Don`t take tension at all, once the grass grows back..<eos> The grass will..
Your brother and that creature inside of you will have won.<eos> - But I killed my family.<eos> I was weak. - No !<eos> You're the only chance your family has to survive this, and continue in through you.<eos> Do you understand ?<eos> Do you understand me ?<eos> You carry your family with you, Mary-Elizabeth, but you have to survive.<eos> And then forgive yourself for surviving.<eos> I just pray to God that you remember this.<eos> I will.
Sounds like you've been listening to the wrong source.<eos> It would appear so, now, wouldn't it?<eos> You don't like me very much, do you, Baliel?<eos> Strange, because I hear no complaints from the others.<eos> Is it something I've done?<eos> More like something you haven't.<eos> Then let me put your mind to rest.<eos> You did a good thing to bring him here.<eos> -I'm not sure the others will agree.<eos> -Oh, they will.
How did you know I am outside the car?<eos> Fear darling. Fear! From the fear in your voice..<eos> Even a blind man on the phone.. ..can tell that I am outside the car, right?<eos> Right!<eos> Can you see the white wire?<eos> - Yes, I can see it.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Will I get a shock?<eos> - You will find out.<eos> No, you won't.
- Really?<eos> - Yes, really!<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
- Warning. - Sawyer, let's go!<eos> - Warning. - Sawyer!<eos> Then what the hell do you suggest we do?<eos> Go get Danny, then find Austen and Ford and bring them back.<eos> No.<eos> You do that and Ben dies. - Go.<eos> - No, you think I'm lying?<eos> You think that this is a bluff?<eos> I will let him die.<eos> No. Jack. You won't.
I'M--I'M GIVING YOU YOUR SPACE, I JUST... CAME BY TO TELL YOU THAT'M... GIVING MYSELF UP.<eos> WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU?<eos> I DON'T KNOW.<eos> I'LL PROBABLY GO AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.<eos> I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE AND SAY THAT I'M SORRY.<eos> I'M REALLY SORRY, REGINA.<eos> LOOK, I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.<eos> I JUST WANTED TO BE THE MAN YOU WANTED.<eos> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.<eos> BUT YOU WILL.
Mrs. Kessler told me.<eos> She did?<eos> I can't believe she narced.<eos> I-I-I--all those years, I pretended to love those bundt cakes.<eos> She said that in this day and age, when it's impossible to count on anyone... what could be better than knowing there's a guy who'll always be there?<eos> She said that?<eos> She did.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I gotta get back to work, but you should ask me in sometime.<eos> I will.
Distilled or something?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That would kill the fish.<eos> So they must shut it down to clean the tank.<eos> No, I checked.<eos> It runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<eos> It's never been shut down.<eos> So how do they do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who will?
Let's just say next time i'm south of the border, officer batista will be expecting me to go "south of the border."<eos> - really?<eos> - No, you creep.I just asked.<eos> It was no big deal.<eos> Julio's records were sealed because he was a juvenile when he committed his heinous act.<eos> He took a neighbor's horse so he could give his girlfriend a ride on the beach.<eos> Officer batista laughed when i asked him if julio might've been a hit man.<eos> Then he cried when i told him julio was dead.<eos> - You don't have to say it.<eos> - I won't.
Fortuitous I didn't knock over the plant.<eos> Well, if you had, there'd have been two all-meat pizzas floating' out there.<eos> As I've always said, Bedzyk, you're a kindly, thoughtful man.<eos> Just passin' the time till it's my turn - to go out the garbage port.<eos> - I am Samswope!<eos> No, you loathsome creature, I am Samswope!<eos> Come on, Bedzyk, it's not that bad.<eos> At the very least, we are still alive.<eos> We'll find a landfall.<eos> We will... - All in the fullness of time.
You are normal. Right.<eos> You should've never had children.<eos> Not when you knew there was a chance they'd be like you.<eos> All locked up.<eos> Did Ariel say "good night"?<eos> Just not to me.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> Give her time.<eos> What if she doesn't?<eos> She will.
They've always loved him and he's always loved to be loved.<eos> Whereas you...<eos> Well, you're you, aren't you?<eos> Cold and heartless?<eos> I'll not say that.<eos> But you've never been the affectionate type now, have you?<eos> Thank you, Pullo.<eos> - I'll be hearing about the grain, then, will I?<eos> - Perhaps Bibulus will succeed?<eos> - No, he won't.
Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I love the food at the Mix, and...<eos> But I haven't been able to come in there, because... you know...<eos> Come in and eat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> All right, I will.
I'm sorry I fixed your toilet.<eos> I'm sorry I was a jerk about that.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I know you love me.<eos> I do.<eos> You do?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> So... so tell me.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
- Oh, John.<eos> Yeah, good one.<eos> Actually, I've got a room reserved for you two.<eos> - Mm? You have double rooms?<eos> - I'm sure I could sort something out.<eos> - It'll be separate rooms by then, dear.<eos> - Oh, no, that told you.<eos> I wouldn't let you go into a home.<eos> - You might not have a choice.<eos> - I will.
After all, that's what Lex is gonna get a big dose of.<eos> Victor and AC were able to hack into the 33.1 mainframe... before we blew the building.<eos> That was your other mission.<eos> Haven't met the computer yet I couldn't crack wide open.<eos> What'd you guys find out?<eos> Lex isn't satisfied playing in his own backyard anymore.<eos> LuthorCorp is starting up divisions of 33.1 all across the globe.<eos> Wherever there's evidence of people with abilities... there'll be laboratories to do experiments.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> We won't.
Yeah, right.<eos> Why are you doing this, Frank?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're his father. He would have wanted to see you either way, and now he's going to find out you lied to him. I made some phone calls.<eos> You're as healthy as a horse.<eos> You, uh... you checked up on my story?<eos> Yeah, for good reason. Your story doesn't check out.<eos> The cab is on its way.<eos> Now before you go, tell Ryan the truth.<eos> Or I will.
All my clients have their tactics.<eos> But hers was... insane.<eos> She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.<eos> You have 13 alleles in common.<eos> You killed your mother.<eos> Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
Okay, it's not the first one to be able to read people's minds.<eos> Hey, let me guess. You were personally chosen to smite some sinner?<eos> You just got to wait for some divine bat signal.<eos> Is that it? Yeah, actually.<eos> Great.<eos> I don't suppose you asked what this alleged bad guy did.<eos> Actually, I did, dean.<eos> And the angel told me.<eos> He hasn't done anything... yet.<eos> But he will.
You intend to use Unit-01?<eos> There is no other choice.<eos> Ikari Shinji-kun...?<eos> Y-Yes?<eos> You will pilot it.<eos> Father?<eos> You know why.<eos> you want me to step into this and fight that thing outside?<eos> Correct.<eos> I won't!
When we were friends, I felt like I could do anything.<eos> It's so awesome.<eos> She sees a light. She's ready to cross over now.<eos> No!<eos> No, she can't go yet.<eos> I need to say that I'm sorry. And I was stupid and lame.<eos> - And if I could take it all back, I swear.<eos> - Tell her it's ok.<eos> Tell her she's a really good person and it's ok to let others see it.<eos> I will.
I mean, you ain't much, but you're the best she ever had.<eos> No, no, nothing's wrong.<eos> I just... I have to go to work today.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Silly me.<eos> Naomi never dated anybody with a job before.<eos> At least not one that's indoors and legal.<eos> I understand.<eos> Well, you let me know if you need anything.<eos> I will.
- "Ten Designers to Watch."<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> You'll totally get in!<eos> The beginning of your huge career!<eos> Betty, settle.<eos> I enter every year.<eos> There's thousands of applicants, and the one who picks who gets in...<eos> Wilhelmina. Ooh.<eos> - Well, she'll die eventually.<eos> - No, she won't.
- Jack's father?<eos> - He was killed in the air strike.<eos> And Cheng is in custody.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Look... I was talking to Dr Hastings.<eos> He says the test results are in, but he's not telling me anything.<eos> Is it... serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bloody hell, Chloe. Whatever it is, I'll help you get through it.<eos> - No, you won't.
Take me to her now.<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I know that I promised... to take care of you, and protect you,<eos> but I'm at a crossroads.<eos> Right now, the best way... the only way... to do that is to let you go.<eos> I hope one day you can understand that.<eos> I hope one day you can forgive me.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.
You were the one who told me to make up with Women United Through Faith.<eos> Yeah,I'm not making up with them,though, and I'm not raising money for them.<eos> They're raising money for teen abstinence awareness.<eos> Very dangerous stuff.<eos> I'm completely behind teen abstinence.<eos> I'm just saying,as a former teen,it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Ever.<eos> These scripts will just have to sell for exactly the same price without your name on them.<eos> Yes,they will.
Cos you are the best of them.<eos> Oh, an egg.<eos> Oh, haven't got an egg.<eos> Haven't got an egg. Um. Oh.<eos> Tell her!<eos> Tell her! Oh, not today!<eos> Have a heart!<eos> Oh, tell her!<eos> No, it can't!<eos> No, I won't!
Oh, I had such a lovely dream...<eos> Wow.<eos> Get it out.<eos> We can at least some spliffs before you're taken out and debollocked.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> Thanks Tone.<eos> Relax.<eos> We'll sell it tomorrow.<eos> Where?<eos> We just will.
Ted might have a broken arm and the Janitor is blind!<eos> Hey, wait. No.<eos> Coming back. Hello!<eos> Who's making pancakes?<eos> See?<eos> He's great and so's Ted.<eos> Oh, I think he popped it back into joint.<eos> You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.<eos> I can't miss this.<eos> I just... I won't.
Come inside, we'll talk about it there.<eos> No.<eos> You just...<eos> Just give me five green and I am gone.<eos> I'll give it to you inside.<eos> I'll never come out of there alive.<eos> Lisa... you're probably right.<eos> Forget about the money!<eos> I won't say a word, I swear!<eos> Yeah, you will.
Panco team, meet your new legal chief.<eos> Aubrey's a five-star paralegal, who wants to be a lawyer, too.<eos> She's the hardest worker I've got.<eos> - Would you like to take a stab at this?<eos> - I am not a lawyer, Mr. Rich.<eos> The Rosemere Academy, fifteen-hundred a month, eighteen a year.<eos> Our school is currently full, Mrs. Rich.<eos> They're ain't nobody gonna tell me I don't care about my kids.<eos> - They're not gonna let us in.<eos> - Yeah, they will.
Wow!<eos> Great.<eos> - If I wasn't seeing Simon, that'd be amazing.<eos> - Simon?<eos> That's me.<eos> - We've got so much in common.<eos> - Depression, self-Ioathing.<eos> He knows we can't have a physical thing, I don't do that now.<eos> - I'm still hoping you'll change your mind.<eos> - I won't.
You've been off your game, you're distracted, exhausted.<eos> You're just, you know frankly, you're plain obnoxious.<eos> I just haven't been sleeping very well.<eos> You need to pull it together, and focus on your job, fast.<eos> Or I can find someone who can handle the press as well as pull a comb through their hair once a week.<eos> - Lieutenant.<eos> - Good morning, XO.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It's just temporary.<eos> The colonel will...
- He was scratching the walls.<eos> - He kept scratching until his fingers bled.<eos> - (Cabott) I won't say.<eos> He was in Cylon detention on New Caprica, you remember?<eos> He came out all squirrelly, and this is not helping.<eos> You gotta get him outta here. It doesn't matter.<eos> - Where are the seals?<eos> - Oh, you son of a bitch.<eos> - Come on. - Galen, you gotta get him outta here.<eos> - Cabott? - No, I won't...
Don't forget your wrench.<eos> Mike, where are you going?<eos> Mike!<eos> Hey, Mr. Delfino.<eos> I need to, uh, talk to your stepdad.<eos> Orson's not here. He went to the hospital with my mom.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Mr. Hodge... Your wife's just sleeping. I suggest you go home and do the same.<eos> I will.
You just keep me posted.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> That's all I got for now.<eos> I'm sorry, it was hard to tell exactly how he looked like.<eos> No, It,s OK.<eos> We understand.<eos> Andre, kept saying that the government was make him rich.<eos> Will you pay to save my husband life?<eos> We will.
Do this as a favour to me<eos> Because of the wrong blood type My wife might divorce me<eos> But I don't want to leave her<eos> You should clarify it and decide<eos> I don't care about the child's true identity<eos> Dr. Zhang, I'll treat him as my own<eos> My wife is very stubborn<eos> When I discovered her affair She want to suicide<eos> If she does that again Who will take care of this child?<eos> What will this family then?
Would you like to come inside for a drink of coffee?<eos> Listen you left a message on my machine; you said you needed to talk about Mina, but I don't have a lot of time, so...<eos> I know you've talked with the police and the FBI...<eos> Yeah, so what, what are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna go through the same line of questioning a third time?<eos> Thank you, but no.<eos> You feel it, don't you?<eos> There's something going on here about Mina's death.<eos> Things you're not sure you can talk about with the police and FBI, because you don't think they'll believe you.<eos> I will.
So everybody works late.<eos> PCRs ASAP.<eos> Elvia, where's your mother?<eos> She died last year.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> My father brought me here so we can be happy.<eos> Well, you're going to have to take charge, okay?<eos> I want you to make sure your father does not get out of bed, that he gets lots and lots of rest.<eos> Will papa get better?<eos> Yeah, he will, yeah.
Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I want to bring some friends to Atlantis, and apparently I've got to clear it through you first.<eos> Unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any offworld visits to Atlantis for the time being.<eos> - On whose authority?<eos> - It was a directive from the IOA.<eos> - Well, they don't need to know.<eos> - Ronon, she's... I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.<eos> It is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.<eos> And it will.
I told you guys already.<eos> It's mine.<eos> My nose started bleeding.<eos> No, actually, Cayla told us that, which means that I don't know really who is covering for who.<eos> Okay, Ashley was outside at the time, and I wasn't even at the party, okay?<eos> I was at the gym.<eos> Feel free to check.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I will.
- There's always furniture to sell.<eos> - Sounds good. - You've come for pictures of Lane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thanks. I am giving these to you in pristine condition, and I expect that that is how they will be returned.<eos> Do not cut them up or put glue on the back.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> I will return them in the condition in which they were received.<eos> - See you at the shower.<eos> - No, you won't.
What's he talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He must be halucinating.<eos> He seemed very lucid to me.<eos> You know you are beautiful.<eos> You're delirious.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> We'll talk about it when you're better.<eos> I can't wait that long.<eos> But I will.
Blake's Seven? Pepperoni pizza?<eos> - Connor?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're good times.<eos> Weren't they?<eos> You can fight the dark side, mate.<eos> You really can.<eos> You too, Connor. Move away!<eos> He will kill you.<eos> No he won't.
And what's gonna happen when Julie finds out you knocked up my sister?<eos> Didn't your stepdad just say no one's gonna find out about that?<eos> Okay.<eos> Try this.<eos> Julie's a nice girl, and you, well... you're a dog.<eos> No knock.<eos> I'm a dog lover myself, but Julie deserves better.<eos> You know you'll just end up cheating on her.<eos> No, I won't hurt her again.<eos> Sure you will.
Well, listen, I don't know nothing about none of that.<eos> Sh-She was breathing when I left her.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> But I have a boyfriend.<eos> So you say.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not that hard up.<eos> Look, she didn't like me.<eos> So what?<eos> On to the next who will.
You and the Director have a nice chat?<eos> Well, I wouldn't call it "nice".<eos> Illuminating, perhaps.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Well, not for her.<eos> As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
Serious pain in my ass.<eos> - I'd understand if they were shagging. - They're not!<eos> - They are! - They're not!<eos> - They are?<eos> - I said they're not!<eos> You say that like they are!<eos> Oh, they are!<eos> I'm such a terrible liar!<eos> Look, you have to promise me, you can't tell anybody!<eos> Of course I won't.
He's no longer a cop!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Please don't, honey!<eos> Leave.<eos> Please stop...<eos> Listen to me...<eos> Please don't, honey...<eos> You promised not to get involved again.<eos> I have a feeling that it'll kill you.<eos> It won't.
- No! I haven't heard anything!<eos> - He didn't come home last night!<eos> - Do you know where he might be?<eos> - He told me he would be at the Great Hall.<eos> - I'll go there and check for him, Mrs. B.<eos> You stay there and do as your husband told you to do.<eos> Keep your door closed and locked!<eos> f I hear anything I'll come right back and let you know.<eos> - Tell him I love him!<eos> - I will!
So... this guy who ripped you off... you wanna give me his name, tell me where I can find him?<eos> You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy.<eos> I wanna help you.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> It's his.<eos> The baby's his, and I still love him.<eos> So call the cops. Have him locked up.<eos> Will you ever forgive your mom for calling the cops?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
- No?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Killed a monkey once.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.<eos> I won't.
Such injustice?<eos> You've carried the entire burden alone, sis.<eos> Try to understand me..<eos> ..he's asked for your hand.. ..what can you possibly do now?<eos> If you refuse.. ..it impacts Chutki.<eos> If you say yes.. ..then both your relationships will have.. ..a sword dangling over them for life.<eos> No, daughter!<eos> Wait here. I'll do something..<eos> No, mother.<eos> You won't.
I don't need soldiers.<eos> I need soldier.<eos> I just need the one.<eos> Why?<eos> I couldn't just come out and say that, could I, Sam?<eos> I had to let everyone think they had a fighting chance.<eos> But what I need... Is a leader.<eos> To lead who?<eos> Oh, I've already got my army -<eos> - Or I will soon, anyway.
Yeah, well, maybe they know what's good for him.<eos> Hey, better me teaching him than some pasty Hugh Grant wannabe.<eos> Yeah, I saw y'all talking to him.<eos> Hey, we don't talk to no...<eos> They are the enemy.<eos> Please, like I chose to have him breathing on me and shoving his flyers in my face.<eos> Someone's got to put that guy on a bus.<eos> Hey, I feel you on that.<eos> (woman) So why don't you, if you're so offended by him taking your students?<eos> Well, maybe I will.
It felt good to be holding the mother of my child.<eos> This is nice. But given recent events, cuddling was as far as I was gonna go.<eos> Kim and I had to get to know each other again and build trust and...<eos> Oh, my God, is that side-boob?<eos> Careful with the side-boob, big guy.<eos> My hormones are going crazy.<eos> I might just pounce your skinny ass. - Kim, I really don't think we should.<eos> - I won't, then.
Wit?<eos> Get that girl out of here, now.<eos> - Where is she now?<eos> In the shower.<eos> - You want me to just burst in?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you don't tell her... then I'll tell her myself.<eos> - You wouldn't do that.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - You won't.
Well, I suppose you should first meet with the client.<eos> He didn't sound very pleasant as the police report read.<eos> –No, he didn't.<eos> –Can't say I want to meet him.<eos> Arrested for what?<eos> Ah, it was a conflict of interest.<eos> I was involved with this cop who was working on a case that I was... involved with.<eos> –Oh, dear God.<eos> Alan will take care of it.<eos> No, he will not.
Nancy Wilding is hoping that person is you.<eos> I'll take it under advisement.<eos> Uh, wait, wait. You didn't hear from me.<eos> I'll take it under advisement. I'll hear you before I read my ruling.<eos> Judge, I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.<eos> Whatever.<eos> –This is not going well, Alan.<eos> –You think?<eos> She won't even hear our side.<eos> Hopefully she will before she—
Of course it's possible to do a wire transfer.<eos> But they'll see what bank the money came from, and they'll flag the account.<eos> Abe.<eos> You can do something here.<eos> Come on, man, don't shit me.<eos> Well, I mean, what we could...<eos> What we could do is we could transfer the money from multiple accounts.<eos> Like, you know, commercial and personal accounts.<eos> Then you route the money through different branches and create, like, a smokescreen, a labyrinth, if you will.<eos> If you will.
But we need all the leverage we can get.<eos> And I need some money.<eos> No one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan it.<eos> So you tell these people whoever it is that took Sara and my nephew...<eos> You tell them I get it, and I'm gonna do everything I can.<eos> I'm gonna break this guy out of here, or I'm gonna die trying.<eos> And if it's the latter then that should count for something, right?<eos> That's gotta count for something.<eos> You tell them that.<eos> - I will.
- For what? - I don't know.<eos> I'm sorting it through. I could use your help.<eos> We're in a<eos> - We're in a bad spot. I feel for you, man, but I'm done with bad spots, Linc.<eos> I'm gonna go see Maricruz.<eos> I talked to my cousin Petey. He told me she's back in Chicago.<eos> Hey, you're still wanted in Chicago, remember?<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> If you change your mind, I'm staying at the Plaza del Sol.<eos> I won't.
To get to the heart of the story, you have to go back to the beginning.<eos> His Majesty, the king.<eos> My dear sister.<eos> Fare you well on your journey.<eos> Remember, the king of Portugal, your future husband loves and respects you.<eos> And you must love him in return.<eos> Remember your promise.<eos> When he dies, I marry whom I choose.<eos> Charles, as you love me, take care of her.<eos> I will.
You must go to Hyunto and appease the governor.<eos> Will His Majesty go to Hyunto?<eos> He'll never go, not even if it means going to war.<eos> We're in big trouble then.<eos> We'll have no salt.<eos> Who could've done such a stupid thing?<eos> - Bulgae.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Bring this matter to light, whatever it takes.<eos> I will, Your Highness.
All troops have a hierarchy, just like the Palace.<eos> Bosses must be able to order their workers around.<eos> Otherwise nothing will work.<eos> Will you do as I say?<eos> Yes.<eos> This goes for Kepil, Wootae and Sayong, as well as Sosuhno.<eos> Respect and learn from all who joined before you did.<eos> I'll do as you say, my Lord.<eos> You tell him what to do.<eos> I will, my Lord.
Are you going to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's nothing to gain from fighting Dochi's troop.<eos> You're right but... Giving in like that will hurt our pride.<eos> Did you say pride?<eos> You suggested we steal his salt but you ended up getting kidnapped.<eos> Our pride's already been hurt.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Tell Wootae to return the salt.<eos> I will, my Lord.
It's for Puyo and our people.<eos> Answer me.<eos> Your Highness...<eos> Tell me and I will reward you greatly when I become King.<eos> But if you don't, I'll kill you here and now.<eos> So tell me.<eos> Commander Haemosu's grave... is right beneath Mt. Chunbu.<eos> Mt. Chunbu...<eos> Go to Mt. Chunbu and do as I said.<eos> I will, Your Highness.
I trade with a Haengin man called Baemang.<eos> He was once a soldier... but things went wrong and he became a bandit.<eos> Handang saw Prince Jumong locked up in their hideout.<eos> And?<eos> Handang told him to kill Prince Jumong.<eos> He should be dead by now.<eos> Who else knows of this?<eos> You're the first to hear.<eos> Don't you dare tell anyone else.<eos> I won't.
Puyo has forsaken me.<eos> So I will now turn against Puyo and serve the three-legged crow.<eos> I have sinned greatly against you.<eos> I'll tell you what I did when the time is right.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Yeomieul just left the Palace.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell them to select a new Sorceress.<eos> The Shrine must not be left unattended.<eos> I will, Your Highness.
Why is this happening to me?<eos> I'm sorry, Your Majesty.<eos> I just can't figure out what happened.<eos> This is a disaster, not a disease.<eos> The disaster we're facing is now upon me.<eos> Oi.<eos> Yes?<eos> What we saw and heard in there must remain our secret.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Ted is not an explorer.<eos> He raises a good point.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> With my maps and my journals, a six-year-old could find the shrine.<eos> Thank you, I think.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you ready for your big adventure.<eos> Now, Ted, the journal won't take you right to the idol.<eos> It won't?
Where can I find her?<eos> This story isn't hers alone but all of ours!<eos> - You people.<eos> You got yourself something.<eos> You know what you got now, Chris?<eos> How about breaking and entering?<eos> By the looks of this, a little assault as well.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> - This can't go any farther.<eos> - It won't, Sister.
You have been orientated for years.<eos> Don't come up to me, go "Where am I gonna get that?"<eos> I'm not interested!<eos> You figure it out.<eos> I only wanted big things for you, Bartleby.<eos> I'd say this is pretty big.<eos> Thanks, Dad. Ah!<eos> Thanks, Pop.<eos> Okay, honey, I want you to have a good semester.<eos> Okay, I will.
Ellis?<eos> Ellis? - I'm coming.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - To cheer him up.<eos> The nicest one is for you.<eos> - That's sweet.<eos> Are you coming with me?<eos> Actually I have to go home.<eos> - So I won't be seeing you tonight?<eos> Of course you will.
He is alright. No broken bones.<eos> Was knocked out.<eos> Remember anything?<eos> What are we gonna call him?<eos> I like the name alfred<eos> Give me a break. We'll call him vasia<eos> Why did you bring him?<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> What if he dies?<eos> He won't.
God, I can't...<eos> I am just so glad you're alive.<eos> A Hermosa Beach woman brutally assaults an UPU officer with an oversized dildo.<eos> A reversible birth control option for dogs may one day replace neutering.<eos> Bin Laden's search...<eos> Did you get the tape?<eos> When do I get paid?<eos> Soon enough, baby.<eos> That shit better not get out.<eos> Oh, it won't.
The secret you are looking for is hidden in the Baron's private chamber.<eos> What is the secret?<eos> There's a dead body they've retrieved from the desert.<eos> They found the body in your car.<eos> Did I kill someone out there?<eos> They're listening.<eos> They're watching.<eos> If you should succeed, remember me, my love.<eos> Remember my name.<eos> I will.
You live in the world, where people think you're a certain kind of man.<eos> I am a certain kind of man.<eos> You know, when I was a kid it seemed natural that a grown man would stay up nights with catgut and steel wire, pliers and scissors, and make little catapults.<eos> Read books about them.<eos> Will you change your mind?<eos> You know, I could hurt you, Jack.<eos> Like you're trying to hurt me.<eos> I could say something.<eos> I could tell you something that would hurt.<eos> But I won't.
Pen and ink.<eos> For writing.<eos> It's all done except the last chapter.<eos> I want you to help me.<eos> How?<eos> Finish it.<eos> Finish it.<eos> - I don't know how it ends.<eos> - You do.<eos> You will.
Stop it!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Leave me! Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Leave me! Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
We saw her in the forest again...<eos> the old woman.<eos> Danu thinks she's a sign that the horned soldiers will come.<eos> He also says that the moon slid across the ocean... and fell off the earth.<eos> I miss her, Father.<eos> Why did Ffion have to be taken?<eos> How many of us must die for this one prince?<eos> There are certain things that you cannot understand yet, Theo.<eos> Then I want to learn.<eos> You will... in time.
Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm here to help remove the Princess material.<eos> Do you know where Charlie is?<eos> No one does.<eos> Is your name August?<eos> Yes.<eos> I forgot to tell Preben that you should remove Christina's tomb.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We won't do that.<eos> Okay, then I will.
This woman, Karen Eiffel, she's one of my favorite authors.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Beautiful tragedies.<eos> Just beautiful. Anyway let me quickly copy this list for you, just in case.<eos> Sociopathic author.<eos> - I just wanted to thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Listen, please, you must tell me if you hear the voice of the narrator again just for my own edification.<eos> I will.
Care package from Babe!<eos> It's beluga!<eos> Let's get some Ritz crackers and eat it right now.<eos> Let's. And you know what I think you should do tomorrow?<eos> Go see the Clutter place.<eos> Honey, if Alvin Dewey won't return my calls, I'll never see the house.<eos> You know everybody on the planet.<eos> Call somebody.<eos> And please tell the duke and duchess I am sick to miss the dance.<eos> I will.
The only reason we're here is because we agreed that she'd be going to the Olympics.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I guess I lied. Hmm?<eos> Look, everyone...<eos> Everyone wants to hear that their kid is special.<eos> And they are.<eos> And maybe they're going to the Olympics.<eos> - "Maybe. "<eos> - Yes. Maybe they will.
I can't. I can't.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I already have a plan for dinner.<eos> Thanks for my present.<eos> We- - We almost forgot.<eos> My cut.<eos> You really want this money?<eos> I helped.<eos> You're a fuck.<eos> You just will.
Are you gonna sue me for sexual harassment?<eos> That was fun.<eos> What are they doing down there?<eos> Javier:<eos> Oh no, Dylan brought his Scrabble games.<eos> Scrabble?<eos> Dylan: I get 30 seconds for each board.<eos> We need one more.<eos> Who wants to play?<eos> I will.
You have to force yourself.<eos> Good girl!<eos> You see? She's getting better.<eos> Ira, sing the song you learned, dear.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> What injections have they been giving her?<eos> You'll have to ask the doctor.<eos> They give her what she needs.<eos> I'll ask right now!<eos> I will!
Suppositories?<eos> So keep it up.<eos> Coming to Andre's birthday?<eos> I have a ton of work.<eos> Stop by to please Francois.<eos> Move!<eos> I have another patient to see.<eos> - She won't come.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because she won't.
- Who are you? Whoever you want me to be honey...<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> - Hey... - Dude... What are you doing?<eos> Sorry son...<eos> Just a little... tied up...<eos> Oh God... da...<eos> And how did this break?<eos> I'll teach you how...<eos> I will...
A plan that could see us all retired within the next two weeks.<eos> - Hey, you tell him yet?<eos> - Tell me what?<eos> This is a mark worth millions.<eos> No security on corporate insurance.<eos> That'll cover getting him back fast, no matter what the price.<eos> With the prenup we have, there's just no other way.<eos> I want them all dead and the trail leading to McCain.<eos> - If something goes wrong-<eos> - It won't.
- Mister?<eos> - Mande.<eos> - Spanish?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Watch the movie, Dad.<eos> - Are we going to mass?<eos> - I heard the bells.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Tell your mom to get ready.<eos> Okay, I will.
Does this thing have an airbag?<eos> No.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To a job interview. - Another one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where'd you get the suit?<eos> I don't want Mom's money.<eos> I wasn't going to give it to you. I know, but I still don't want it.<eos> You keep it.<eos> Of course I will.
Mattie, look at me.<eos> I saw it... the thing Josh was talking about, it came for me.<eos> - Right after I found this.<eos> - What?<eos> The virus Josh was working on.<eos> I found it taped inside of his computer case.<eos> Off-line, where they couldn't get to it.<eos> - Will it work?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But Zeigler will.
Okay, this is too much.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?<eos> Did you retrieve the map legend?<eos> Yes. And the map also.<eos> The location of King Solomon's Mines is safe?<eos> All right. Grab the first plane out and return to the library.<eos> I'm not coming home right away, Judson.<eos> I'm going to the Mines.<eos> It's dangerous, Flynn. I mean, if the Key of Solomon should fall into the wrong hands...<eos> It won't, okay?
My people wanted to be assured that the operation had gone according to plan.<eos> Oh, your people.<eos> It's my plan. It's my operation.<eos> Why would your people think anything could go wrong?<eos> Stand back<eos> - You stupid idiot!<eos> It's OK.<eos> The container is not compromised.<eos> Sorry. I won't do that again.<eos> No. You won't.
He won't even notice.<eos> You look great, boy.<eos> Not bad at all.<eos> Hurry, your father's waiting.<eos> Do we have to go?<eos> These Sunday drives are very important to your father.<eos> How would it look if we didn't go together as a family?<eos> But it's weird.<eos> We never know anybody.<eos> Well, maybe this time we will.
I'm telling you, they should come from you.<eos> I'm not going to make it to December.<eos> No more Christmases.<eos> Promise me you're going to make the day a special day for them.<eos> Promise me you'll make it a big deal.<eos> How about I make it... a big deal for all of us?<eos> If you insist on trying to cheer me up, I'm going to leave you.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Not if it's going to cheer you up.<eos> It won't.
- Yes, all of them.<eos> I'm a master student. - Put it down.<eos> Are you a master student, too?<eos> - No, I'm a killer.<eos> Put it down. You never know what it's good for.<eos> Let those losers fight it out.<eos> It doesn't get my nipples hard.<eos> We're here now...<eos> and we'll see this through.<eos> No, we won't, you fucking cunt!
It's like a playground.<eos> But there's one thing you should never do.<eos> The thing you do best.<eos> Play piano.<eos> No, sleep.<eos> You'll be more famous than him.<eos> Much bigger.<eos> I really believe in you.<eos> They'll shave your head, too.<eos> - No, they won't.
I was kidding, Cliff. - You got a pen, kid?<eos> I was kidding.<eos> Your house is going into foreclosure.<eos> - I'm post-dating it.<eos> Stop being the hero. - Go to bed.<eos> - I got it, I got it.<eos> Walk away. Go. - I got it.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Go to bed.<eos> - I will.
- I've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.<eos> They want me to go over, all expenses paid.<eos> - But you can't start going on chat shows.<eos> - Why not? .<eos> Has nothing I've said made any sense to you? .<eos> They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> - I can answer anything.<eos> - Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> - They can't keep changing.<eos> - They won't.
Why don't we get everything out of the car, you know, before it gets dark?<eos> I'm going to go look for the breaker box.<eos> Why don't you see if the water's turned on yet, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Figures.<eos> There's frickin' rats!<eos> One just tried to rip my throat out.<eos> Mom!<eos> What if the rat comes back?<eos> He won't.
Biting me, for one thing.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got to get this place sprayed.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll buy some stuff tomorrow.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> It's their room.<eos> They should pay for it.<eos> - But someone would have to come in.<eos> - Goddamn right, they will.
And escort her from the guest quarters to wherever His Highness pleases.<eos> Such is my misfortune.<eos> Sounds like a funny misfortune to me.<eos> She is very beautiful, yes.<eos> Mon dieu, quelle pétasse!<eos> Un shrew sans pareille.<eos> More arrack, Jacques.<eos> More arrack.<eos> We shall all have sore heads tomorrow.<eos> Well, you will, anyhow, Jacques.
- Of course not.<eos> - Ready? Right.<eos> - One...<eos> - Two...<eos> Three.<eos> That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.<eos> Very nice.<eos> And the best part is...<eos> I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.<eos> Someday, perhaps you will.
Live and die all by yourself.<eos> No people.<eos> We're up here together, you and me.<eos> In this little box.<eos> Above the clouds.<eos> Overlooking the world.<eos> Imagine when we come down from the mountain.<eos> With this gift of fire?<eos> They'll never understand.<eos> One day they will.
That was the best moment ever with my dad.<eos> And then we went home, and it was the best evening ever.<eos> We had fish and chips, we fooled around.<eos> I don't remember us fooling around before.<eos> Anyone for bar mitzvah cake?<eos> But what I now think is this.<eos> What happens when you become a man is that you stop blaming your dad for not being perfect.<eos> You realise he's just a man and you love the man he is.<eos> And on my bar mitzvah, my dad became my friend for one day and I loved him.<eos> And I always will.
Sure, sure, I guess.<eos> Did my mom break your heart?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Well, you got over it, huh?<eos> I guess.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> I just feel like I might not get over it, you know?<eos> Like maybe I'm too sensitive or something.<eos> Well, maybe you won't.
You can't will anybody to do anything.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> What was her name?<eos> Sarah.<eos> Did she ever love you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think so.<eos> Don't do anything, just be cool, you know.<eos> Just wait; she'll call you.<eos> - She won't.
What do I have to do?<eos> What was her name?<eos> Sarah.<eos> Did she ever love you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think so.<eos> Don't do anything, just be cool, you know.<eos> Just wait; she'll call you.<eos> - She won't.<eos> - Yes, she will.
- Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Mackey.<eos> Your men lack discipline.<eos> They got no respect for chain of command.<eos> - I disagree with that assessment, sir.<eos> - You think they're heroes?<eos> They're cowboys.<eos> They're gonna get people killed.<eos> You better pray they're not detected.<eos> I've ordered Team 1 Helo Platoon to organize an exfil...<eos> No, sir. You will not.
Are they still out there?<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Yeah, they're holding back, though.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> They're holding position, sending for non-lethal weapons.<eos> They want some prisoners for interrogation.<eos> The rest they're gonna send to the farm.<eos> I'm not going back to one of those farms.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't have any choice.<eos> None of us will.
You must relinquish the seat.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Are you an agent for someone else?<eos> Some other group?<eos> Someone covetous of our success?<eos> I am my own agent, Roman.<eos> Well, you're not displeasing me, you're throwing out a challenge to God.<eos> You shall relinquish that seat, or I will bring your temple crashing down upon you.<eos> No, you won't.
Self-control?<eos> Barb is deeply upset...<eos> Deeply jealous.<eos> What about you?<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah. Are you jealous when Margie goes off like a tractor-trailer?<eos> I fight my jealousies and I conquer them.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> You can tell Barb that.<eos> Good, I will.
That's who they are?<eos> I don't have the power to stand up to them.<eos> You don't have the power to stand up to anybody.<eos> Demonically speaking, I mean.<eos> But you won't have to.<eos> As far as they know, you're human.<eos> They can't touch you.<eos> Maybe not, but they're sure as hell not gonna let us take out Grant so I can become chairman.<eos> We won't have to take him out, they'll do it for us.<eos> At least Billie's spellbound parents will.
I guess that once the two of us talked to him.<eos> When he killed Bummer Dan by mistake.<eos> And that was high fucking water.<eos> So you'd hold me as fair calling Harry fucking outright dimwitted?<eos> You think better than the sheriff with a shortish temper, which in certain sheriffing situations is a plus, camp be better with Harry?<eos> Anyways.<eos> You gonna have dinner with us?<eos> May be my last fucking meal if apoplexy takes me... off my nervousness.<eos> What if you won?<eos> I won't.
We got him one of the top attorneys in town. We gave him the best defense we could.<eos> He was broke,of course.<eos> Paid me back in paintings.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> It'll have to do.<eos> Now,getting back to leslie.<eos> I don't think she's stable. Noted.<eos> Do you have her address?<eos> She probably wouldn't want me to give it to you.<eos> So I will.
Yeah, you too.<eos> Would you like a drink?<eos> Yeah, that would be great.<eos> I can get it.<eos> Just wanted to finish the sentence.<eos> Excellent book-- shame to put it down.<eos> I hope martinis will be fine.<eos> Ooh, better than fine.<eos> Will Rory be having a martini?<eos> Yes, she will.
What's up?<eos> Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like,<eos> "You know who likes juice?<eos> Ted."<eos> I love juice.<eos> Great. So you want to come over and make juice?<eos> When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> I'll come over.<eos> We'll... juice.
No, I do. Just...what's it gonna do to me?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> I don't know, I find that it makes me floaty and I see trails and colors sometimes...<eos> But is that fun?<eos> Well, let's set me free.<eos> You know what?<eos> It'll give you illusion that will set you free and that's...just too good.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I don't feel anything.<eos> You will.
Hey, Fornell.<eos> I got one right up your jurisdiction.<eos> Like my father always said, "Be careful who you marry, Anthony.<eos> She may end up being a homicidal maniac."<eos> - Your father actually said that to you?<eos> - No, but I'm sure he thought it.<eos> Probably he knew your taste in women.<eos> Abby's got active taps on Sergeant Dawson's cell, home and work phones, boss.<eos> - lf she calls her husband, we'll know.<eos> - She won't.
I'm ready to come home now.<eos> So just...<eos> God, just ask me already.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're gonna be charged with filing a false police report.<eos> You're gonna be remanded for psychiatric care.<eos> No, that detective he's done everything you've asked him to do. So you just tell him that it was a mistake.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yeah, you can.<eos> I won't.
one bad idea after another.<eos> just trying to work a cell phone menu is enough to make you scream.<eos> there's some cold pasta.<eos> no, i ate already.<eos> what's all that?<eos> for the silent auction.<eos> my busy little beaver.<eos> not really.<eos> look, ton', i haven't wanted to bug you, but before you'd gotten hurt, you said you would get that building inspector to cut me some slack so i could get back to my business?<eos> oh yeah, right right. i will, later.
On Earth, we would normally use a technique called aerodynamic dissemination, but because of the problems of doing that inside, say, like, a Wraith hive ship, we have attempted various styles of thermal dissemination.<eos> - Explosives?<eos> - Explosives. Yes, yes.<eos> The problem with an explosive delivery system is that, because the drug is now an aerosol, a third of the tests ignited the medication, rendering it useless.<eos> They call it flashing.<eos> Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons. We found them most difficult to use in outer-atmosphere combat.<eos> When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes. We will.
We are not murderers!<eos> You know, a deputy stopped by today.<eos> Said he was out on the marsh last night.<eos> Said you may have even saved some lives.<eos> Leading those--those things outta there.<eos> Nim helped.<eos> Yeah, I guess people are starting to get to know about your pet, and, uh, i-it's got 'em worried.<eos> Well, people should worry about themselves.<eos> Well, things are gonna get back to normal soon.<eos> No, it won't.
Oh perfect, more guns.<eos> The van said CDC, whatever that is.<eos> Where you going, little man?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Does your lizard know about your other girlfriend?<eos> You know, you'd think girlfriends would be a sore subject for you right now, Greg.<eos> Oh, I'm not worried.<eos> Your sister will snap out of it.<eos> Nah, she won't.
You know?<eos> How is it you know?<eos> My job don't got no "take your daughter to work day. "<eos> - But I want to be able to go out and do-<eos> - You want to fight?<eos> Who are you mad at?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> - I just... want to get out there.<eos> - It's never gonna happen for you.<eos> Sure, it will.
You know, these are actually quite comfortable.<eos> Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.<eos> They're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity.<eos> You're wasting your energy talking.<eos> Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out? Then what, huh?<eos> We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.<eos> We fly home on the wings of imagination?<eos> - Is that what we do, Ronon?<eos> - You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.<eos> - Oh, fine. I will.
No, I can't. I can't walk.<eos> I tried.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, don't leave me, please.<eos> - No, look, look, hey. - Please?<eos> I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right. We'll just hide, all right? We'll wait this out, okay?<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> I'm not leaving you, Peyton.<eos> I won't.
I tried.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, don't leave me, please.<eos> - No, look, look, hey. - Please?<eos> I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right. We'll just hide, all right? We'll wait this out, okay?<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> I'm not leaving you, Peyton.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't, okay?
I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> Yeah you do.<eos> My dad's dead.<eos> They said cancer, but...<eos> Then Warren turned on my mum and me.<eos> He said if I danced at his club, and was nice to some of his friends-<eos> - If you're spinning me another line-<eos> - Setting you up was my last job.<eos> He said if I did that, he'd let me go.<eos> But he never will, will he?
So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?<eos> Okay, I want you to know I tracked down Kandi.<eos> I told her to move on and she has.<eos> So I got no lifeboats, no life preservers, no water wings.<eos> If the ship goes down, I'm going down with it.<eos> So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked.<eos> Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents.<eos> Hello.<eos> What if Dad says I could stay up to watch it?<eos> He won't.
If I could have just one more day.<eos> Just a few hours.<eos> I would show both of you.<eos> He wishes that he could have one more day with both of you.<eos> You have a lifetime.<eos> This baby.<eos> You'll never be far.<eos> Tell my brother to love Lillia.<eos> Love her the way I never could.<eos> I will. I will.
We already have a caterer.<eos> Oh, right. You're getting married.<eos> You see what I did there?<eos> Took a...<eos> It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.<eos> A prom?<eos> Can... can we go to that?<eos> Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, they won't.
Let's go friends. Go!<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna push you. The trek to the erasement camp was long and arduous. We lost many cameramen in the dark forest,<eos> And two to super shrimp Thursday at long john silver. Ugh. It's locked.<eos> No!<eos> What are we gonna do? Stand back, everyone. I'll ram into the door and knock it down.<eos> [large exhale]<eos> Ohh! [dazed] stand back everyone.<eos> I'll ram into the door and knock it down. [deep inhale] [large exhale]<eos> Ohh! [slurred] stand door, every ram.<eos> I'll melatonin. [deep inhale] [large exhale]
We really should be at Lucas'.<eos> You're right. Just stay here for a second.<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I had this morning paper route.<eos> And every morning there was this moment, it was right around dawn, and I would just stop, breathe it all in.<eos> You could almost feel the magic in the world.<eos> But lying here with you, I feel that same stillness.<eos> I can almost believe that the world's not as screwed up as I know it is.<eos> My mom's coming home. She called.<eos> Well, at least now you won't have to live alone in this big giant house.<eos> No, but she will.
But for tonight, let's celebrate.<eos> How you doin'? Thanks.<eos> Damond.<eos> I look forward to working with you, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Likewise.<eos> And congratulations to you, too.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'm going home.<eos> No, come on. Stay. I won't be long.<eos> Yeah, you will.
- That's all.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't.<eos> Doesn't matter, just as long as everything's back to what it should be.<eos> It will be if you get us back.<eos> I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Well, the ring will.
I love him.<eos> Well, I want you to be happy.<eos> I am happy, really happy.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Big day.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're gonna have to tell me how it is living with a guy before I let Luke move in.<eos> If it's too creepy, he may have to stay with Babette.<eos> I will.
That theft charge is from way back.<eos> Theft, possession, trafficking stolen goods, you were a real live gangbanger, weren't you, Clinton?<eos> I was messed up, yeah.<eos> But that was before I got with the theater, got off the street.<eos> We heard you brought trouble right in with you, got tough on other actors, threatened Dennis.<eos> I learned real early how to play tough to cover up being scared.<eos> That's all it was, but I got over it.<eos> And me and Denny got tight.<eos> - You can ask anybody in the cast.<eos> - We will.
- Who?<eos> - Ma.<eos> Aquamom!<eos> I love it. Boom!<eos> There's no way Ma's coming to L.A., bro.<eos> - No way.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> You've never gotten her to come before.<eos> What makes you think she'll come now?<eos> - She won't.
We've already requested and been granted the authority to go after Tippin ourselves.<eos> We're only telling you this because Will is your friend, and we both know you'd want to be informed.<eos> We are not asking you to end your leave.<eos> We have this under control.<eos> You don't need to come back to work.<eos> Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.<eos> She's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.<eos> We anticipate that she will reveal herself before long.<eos> We will find her.<eos> Yes, we will.
Say it again.<eos> I won't let go.<eos> - Again.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> - Again.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> - Again.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> Please... again.<eos> I won't...
You lied to me.<eos> This entire day has been one giant lie.<eos> - What you've done makes me sick!<eos> - Martha, enough.<eos> I need you to swear to me that you will do as I ask... for the country.<eos> I hate you.<eos> The situation with Martha is taken care of.<eos> There are too many loose ends.<eos> We cannot have her unravel everything.<eos> She won't.
Where was Tim Martin ?<eos> I don't know, detective Hubbard.<eos> But I know where he is now.<eos> I saw his brains splattered all over the floor of an abandoned warehouse while his body was being eaten by flies.<eos> And I can't help but think... you may have overreacted.<eos> You can't... you can't tell...<eos> Charlie about Tim.<eos> No, you won't do that.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> - We have a challenge match.<eos> - I know.<eos> It was supposed to start 10 minutes ago.<eos> I was doing an interview.<eos> We all know you're a big superstar, Andi, but tennis should come first.<eos> You're right.<eos> This guy just kept talking.<eos> Tell him you have practice and that being late is frowned upon.<eos> I will.
Leukemia has a higher prevalence in both the young and old.<eos> Cameron: So does asthma.<eos> House: No, no, no.<eos> They can both get diabetes.<eos> N o.<eos> The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Some kind of circle of life thing.<eos> This kid doesn't have kidney failure.<eos> He will.
It's my lucky number.<eos> What about lymphoma?<eos> Causes kidney failure, GI bleed, and can infiltrate the base of the brain.<eos> You check Esther for that?<eos> She never showed any signs of...<eos> If he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain.<eos> Chase, run a blood smear and immunochemistries.<eos> Foreman, get an MRI.<eos> - I'll page Cuddy.<eos> - No, you won't.
I've seen his name in the paper a few times.<eos> He gives lots of money to local charities.<eos> And now I'd like all of you to stand with me...<eos> On this momentous occasion... as we honor this great man.<eos> Maybe he should give some money for some new color guard uniforms.<eos> Stop!<eos> - He's lucky you got there in time.<eos> - He's lucky he's alive.<eos> I figured this for a heart attack or a stroke, but nothing showed up on the test?<eos> Nothing will.
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a Corvette.<eos> He is doing just fine.<eos> Okay, calling cards are the wave of the future.<eos> These things sell themselves.<eos> Who uses calling cards anymore?<eos> You know what, that's a nice attitude, Ryan.<eos> I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.<eos> It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme. Yes. Thank you.<eos> You will get rich quick.<eos> We all will.
You don't know it's going to be okay.<eos> Don't give him false hope.<eos> It's probably nothing though.<eos> Hi. Delivery for Michael Scott.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Okay, this is great.<eos> Thank you, my friends.<eos> She is perfect.<eos> Uh. Dwight, may I have your chair, please?<eos> And some singles, if you will.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm very tired.<eos> I'm going to go home and go straight to bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm going to wear earplugs tonight. The good ones that expand in your ear, so I won't be able to hear anything that might be going on out in the street at all hours of the night.<eos> Thank you, Mama. For everything. And look at it this way.<eos> You're not losing a daughter, you're gaining a son who likes to wear a dress.<eos> - He had better make you happy.<eos> - He will.
- What are they waiting for?<eos> - They're waiting for us to leave the building.<eos> So what do you wanna do?<eos> - How do you trip the silent alarm?<eos> - A key. But if you trip that, LAPD will be here within minutes.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Henderson's men outnumber us.<eos> If we leave now, we lose.<eos> The cops get the recording if we go into custody.<eos> We won't.
*****<eos> I've been waitingfor this.<eos> Now that you'vekilled David, you're gonnareplace me with her.<eos> I didn't do anythingto David.<eos> He left her.<eos> You aresuch a liar.<eos> You know I didn'tdo anything to David, but you can't accept that.<eos> You can't accept thatit's fate that sent David away, and that it's proofthat celia and I are meant for each other.<eos> She'll never love you.<eos> Yes...she...will!
- You know what else I'd like?<eos> - Name it. It's yours.<eos> I want Andrew's room.<eos> You said he's probably not coming back. And I could use the extra closet space.<eos> But, sweetheart, this is his room.<eos> Mom, you forgot my birthday.<eos> You're really in no position to negotiate.<eos> Honey, where am I gonna put all of his things?<eos> And, you know, he might come back at some point.<eos> He won't.
I finally told the truth about not getting into Brown and things are great.<eos> Life is so much better when you're honest.<eos> You just mean what you say, you say what you mean.<eos> I feel like you.<eos> Now that you're on a roll, you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten too?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm gonna wait a little bit on that.<eos> It'll go down easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.<eos> - What if they find out?<eos> - They won't.
Flying, actually.<eos> That man could fly.<eos> Have you ever thought of taking dance?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> Well, maybe you might want to think about it.<eos> There's nothing sexier than a man in tights.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that's true.<eos> Look, can you just tell Lorelai I came by?<eos> Oh, of course I will, honey.
You can't tell anyone, even your friends at school, That daddy's home - For a little while.<eos> - Are you gonna have to go back to afghanistan?<eos> The cia doesn't tell you where they'll send you next.<eos> Is it dangerous to be a spy?<eos> Not as long as nobody knows who you are.<eos> I'm what they call "working deep cover."<eos> That's why, like I said, - You gotta keep the secret.<eos> - I won't tell.<eos> - You better not!<eos> - I won't!
We all do.<eos> -You all know what?<eos> -That you always do that.<eos> They warn us.<eos> -Was it in your mission briefing?<eos> -Under potential hazards.<eos> -Along with mines and drunken soldiers?<eos> -Right above it.<eos> You should read them.<eos> - I will now.
I was angry at Mike.<eos> I never understood how he could quit until now.<eos> I got 'em, boss.<eos> I got 'em from the medics, when they took you.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> You'll do.<eos> It's your team now.<eos> Tim, you're a good agent.<eos> Don't let him tell you otherwise.<eos> I won't, boss.
I didn't shoot her.<eos> Open the trunk!<eos> If you didn't shoot her, then what's this?<eos> That isn't mine.<eos> You're going to tell me you don't remember showing me that on our first date?<eos> And you used it this afternoon?<eos> !<eos> Hey.<eos> You... you have no proof of that.<eos> No, but I will.
No, it's just so sad, you know.<eos> I mean, it's all over.<eos> No more Harbor.<eos> Atwood's going to Berkeley, Marissa's sailing around the world.<eos> - I'm going to Rhode Island.<eos> - Well, I'll be there, too.<eos> We don't know that yet.<eos> We haven't heard from RISD.<eos> Whatever happens, you know, we'll make it work.<eos> - We will?
No, I'll go. Just give me the directions.<eos> Hey, I thought we decided I was coming along.<eos> I'm going to handle this myself.<eos> Okay, if you come, you're staying in the car.<eos> - Aww, you know what?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm really going to miss you bossing me around.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> - Nope, nope.<eos> - Yes, you will.
You never have.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But it's because he's needed me more.<eos> You are always going to find love in the world.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> He was only ever going to get it from me.<eos> You know, I know you believe that.<eos> That's why I've tried so hard to forgive you.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Maybe one day I will.
The child is dead.<eos> You will hold her in your arms and you'll know, for the first time, what it is to feel true love.<eos> But you'll lose everything you've done here.<eos> Wish I had some chocolate caramels.<eos> Let's move! We got some people waiting for their ride down there.<eos> Will you quit looking at me like that?<eos> Like what?<eos> You know like what.<eos> Like we're never gonna see each other again.<eos> We will.
There's nothing you can do, Gaius.<eos> But it'll be OK.<eos> It's you.<eos> Help me.<eos> You have to sign it. They'll kill you if you don't.<eos> Sign it! Sign it!<eos> Sign your name!<eos> - Sign it!<eos> - I can't.<eos> I won't.
My stomach hurts!<eos> You're laughing way too hard.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> But it's hilarious!<eos> It's not.<eos> Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Something might happen again.<eos> It won't.
Unfortunately, the only form of currency I have is that card, so accept that card or you're gonna have to eat that drink.<eos> I'm not gonna eat anything.<eos> Anybody ordering a cafe latte?<eos> - Right here.<eos> - Hey, wait, hold on.<eos> That... that's my drink.<eos> Get me the manager.<eos> Well, tell Ari when you find him<eos> - he needs to call me back.<eos> - I will indeed.
They're expecting it to be turned over.<eos> I should get going.<eos> Tell me, have you ever considered what would happen if you did that?<eos> Once Prophet 5 has the amulet, their use for you, for all of us, would be limited.<eos> Unless we find a way of solidifying our position, making ourselves less expendable.<eos> That's a very bold move, Arvin, trying to cut a side deal with one of their top assets.<eos> I'm well aware that you could walk out of here and tell them what I'm proposing.<eos> You might curry some favor, save your life,<eos> temporarily.<eos> But you won't.
I want Mitchell to look up to me, to be proud of his dad.<eos> Which is why no matter what you do to me I'll never help you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got... a hangnail right there on my thumb.<eos> You mind working on that one next?<eos> Marshall's right about you.<eos> I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> Does that help you sleep at night?<eos> Eventually, Marshall or Rachel will do what I ask.<eos> No. They won't.
- I am.<eos> - Really?<eos> Because right now it sounds like a threat.<eos> - Tyler, you have to talk to us.<eos> - No.<eos> If we get out of the house, can you make it so their cars can't start?<eos> No, I'm not helping.<eos> Didn't you see what they did to that other girl? They took her away.<eos> I don't wanna go away.<eos> You will.
Has your good friend Guy of Gisborne said anything to you?<eos> I think he was a little preoccupied.<eos> But I will go to the castle to see what I can find out.<eos> If I do not rescue them, people will think I cannot protect my men.<eos> Do I risk us all to save them?<eos> You are a good man, Robin.<eos> Nothing will change that.<eos> That won't help you make your decision.<eos> - It might.<eos> - It won't.
Will, go and find Allan and Djaq.<eos> We need to find Lucky George.<eos> He has to be here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Maybe some salt?<eos> Where's Marian?<eos> Good question.<eos> If you've hurt her...<eos> If you've done anything to her...<eos> You'll what?
The House of Armaya.<eos> Domic's faction.<eos> You don't think Boone can really get an audience with a Pure Blood, do you?<eos> I'm not willing to risk it.<eos> I want you in Silvan.<eos> I'll send a team to meet you there.<eos> I'm sending Krista back.<eos> No! Use every asset.<eos> If he gets to Domic and he discovers what we've been doing here.<eos> He won't.
- Freddie.<eos> - Hey,tommy.<eos> How are ya?<eos> - You know my daughter clair.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I haven't seen this many Irishmen in ties since the pope came to town.<eos> Well,you know,if we pull this off, it's gonna be a win for the whole neighborhood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somebody donates more than that, you let me know,and I'll match it.<eos> I will.
Their parties are notorious...<eos> Nothing but free-flowing booze and boys.<eos> They're totally against school policy.<eos> Alcohol at a sorority party?<eos> Doesn't exactly sound like news.<eos> According to reliable sources... four of them... the Theta Betas get pledges all liquored up, take them to a secret room, and have them undress while the guys from their brother fraternity watch the show through a two-way mirror.<eos> If this Parker girl was there...<eos> You had me at "secret room".<eos> Looks like you'll have a room all to yourself.<eos> I will?
Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatever's in his lungs is also in his brain, unless you've got something more promising.<eos> I'll go get an MRI of his head.<eos> Keep testing till you find something.<eos> I'm going to my office to rest for a while.<eos> It's been a long time since I took an anatomy class, but I'm pretty sure you're moving farther and farther away from my lungs.<eos> Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.<eos> Oh, no. Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail?<eos> But you will.
I am so sorry, Vince.<eos> He is not here.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Then when he gets in, tell him I'd like to have lunch.<eos> He wants to have lunch.<eos> Vince, I've got his schedule.<eos> There's no way he can make lunch.<eos> He has a ginormously important lunch already planned.<eos> Okay, then tell him to call me back.<eos> Okay, I will.
I hope so.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> We're heading west, toward the money, toward L.J.<eos> Just got one more stop to make.<eos> What for?<eos> You trust me?<eos> Of course, I trust you, Brad. It's just that if anybody finds out about this, I...<eos> They won't.
Phone book.<eos> It took all night, but I found him.<eos> I paid him a visit this morning.<eos> Put the fear of God into him.<eos> - What did you find?<eos> - His medical records.<eos> He's claustrophobic, paranoid, depressive. Got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide.<eos> He's barely left his house in years.<eos> - Look, Owen, if Jack finds out...<eos> - Well, he won't, will he?
I can'T.<eos> She'll-- she'll never forgive me.<eos> You gotta risk it.<eos> Look at all the other risks you took.<eos> He says you have to risk it.<eos> And tell him I forgive him for the rest.<eos> And he forgives you for the rest of it.<eos> He does?<eos> He does.<eos> Steve... she will,too.
Gene.<eos> Yeah, Gene.<eos> Maybe you've had a little bit too much to drink yourself.<eos> - Lizzie's pregnant.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey! Congratulations.<eos> I want to do the right thing. I really do.<eos> But I don't think she's going to let me.<eos> She will.
So much glare out here, I can't tell if that's the white lady judge or the black lady judge.<eos> Hey ! Get out of my damn living room !<eos> Oh, God, please no.<eos> I need a third umbrella.<eos> Hey, maybe we should unplug the cord before...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'm leaving it here.<eos> It's yours. I have returned it.<eos> And somehow or another, I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.

But even if you are right and she's not that into the idea,I'm still going to get one because I'll just tell her how much it means to me and she'll understand, 'cause we communicate.<eos> That's how we solve problems.<eos> Communication?<eos> Right.<eos> I can predict exactly how your pool table fight's going to go.<eos> I could write the script word for word, and our little play does not have a happy ending.<eos> You are a bizarre human being.<eos> Oh,am I?<eos> Here we go.<eos> She'll say,"isn't the room a little small for a pool table?
The water's cold.<eos> Good for colds.<eos> It's freezing!<eos> Too cold!<eos> Time went by, the World Cup was upon us and no sign of my parents.<eos> I suffered every day at breakfast and dinner at Shlomo's place.<eos> You're your dad's spitting image!<eos> But at least now lunch was somewhere different every day.<eos> - Leave the boy alone.<eos> - I will not!
Under the circumstances, I'm... willing to make an exception.<eos> Just this once.<eos> Thank you, Lord Rusk.<eos> And I thank all of you for your indulgence.<eos> I am honored to have had the opportunity to prepare this site for this...<eos> Oh, get on with it, Van Sciver.<eos> We're far too old to be moved by your honey-voiced ass-kissing.<eos> And remember, you might have built this room.<eos> But that doesn't mean a turned blood like you belongs here.<eos> Or ever will.
She's saying she... She doesn't blame you for all the pain and the worry.<eos> She's saying it's not your fault, Ted.<eos> She shouldn't be here.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> MATT: She's saying it never is.<eos> She said that was the best date.<eos> The picnic on the beach and it poured sheets and sheets of rain.<eos> We sat in my car and listened to the whole American Beauty album.<eos> She remembers it all.<eos> She always will.
My mother needs to gointo a nursing home.<eos> I'm not saying thisbecause I wantyour sympathy.<eos> I just want you to knowhow all this started.<eos> - Your mother-- - she has parkinson'S.<eos> She's getting worseevery day.<eos> Cynthia and andreware good people.<eos> And I believe they havegood intentionswith blackthorne.<eos> So is jeremygoing to join them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He'll makehis own decision.
You know who watches talk shows?<eos> Juries. But that perp walk, rich guy, fancy party, those ridiculous pajamas.<eos> That plays for us.<eos> It's as good as gold.<eos> Besides you told me, "Hey, nail somebody." There's your guy.<eos> You know how many jobs Pruitt brings to the city?<eos> If Pruitt folds, so do dozens of other ancillary businesses.<eos> - Who does that help? - Those are sweatshop jobs.<eos> If they go, you think people will stop coming here?<eos> They won't.
Now it's my turn.<eos> Hey, Sean.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - About Matt, I know.<eos> He's adamant about giving me his kidney.<eos> I'm afraid he's going to leave it on my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.<eos> You don't need Matt's kidney.<eos> Because I'm going to give you mine.<eos> That is very sweet, Sean, but I think that we're both gonna feel a little silly when my body rejects it.<eos> It won't.
Previously on Nip / Tuck...<eos> I don't think it would be appropriate for you to work for us, Monica.<eos> The thing is, Sean, some men can't handle temptation.<eos> Marry me again, Julia.<eos> Sean, what are you doing?<eos> And some men can. Burt can't find out about this.<eos> He won't.
Can I help you find something?<eos> You wouldn't happen to have a good meat knife?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anyway, the other half of the argument was about you.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah. It was already tense enough, but when I brought your name, she lost it.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> Tell her it's all your fault.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - You will eventually.
Like when you got that tow truck driver to drag your pumpkin.<eos> He drove off before I could get the wig on it.<eos> Earl, thanks again for loaning us all this money.<eos> No problem, Crab Man.<eos> Besides, what kind of man doesn't help his ex-wife make bail ?<eos> Recently, Joy and Bargain Bag had a difference of opinion on their return policy.<eos> You can't return this.<eos> I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.

I think we're making progress.<eos> I told you, I'm not pregnant.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> But you can't have the baby.<eos> You'd be a terrible mother.<eos> Why would I be a terrible mother?<eos> We all turn into our parents.<eos> I mean, as soon as Brooke, Jr. Hits puberty,<eos> Brooke, Sr. Hits South Beach.<eos> I will not.
Titus now ordered the area around Jerusalem to be scoured for timber.<eos> Every tree for ten miles was cut down for siege platforms and towers.<eos> When this is finished, the Jews will be finished.<eos> Not much further, men.<eos> We can do it.<eos> They may be stronger than us, but they don't have our brains.<eos> The towers were vast.<eos> Seventy five feet high and weighing many tons, teams of men were needed to move them into position.<eos> - We'll never do it.<eos> - Yes, we will!
Guys, this is what he wants.<eos> How long have we been down here?<eos> We don't even know where here is.<eos> He doesn't want us to know.<eos> He wants to break us down.<eos> It's called sensory depravation.<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> You hear me, you son of a bitch?<eos> ! It's not going to work!<eos> Yes, it will.
Are you ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Now isn't a good time.<eos> Do you want me to get you out of here?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You've done enough damage.<eos> Lane, get in here Lane!<eos> I left so this would stop.<eos> But it didn'T.<eos> It never will.
and "the enemy of Rome will be defeated. "<eos> Stay with me, please, I'm frightened.<eos> - I need to see that the men are following orders. - Orders.<eos> What orders?<eos> Lactantius wants the men to paint the Christian sign on their shields.<eos> He says that if we use it as our standard...<eos> You've caught something from that sorcerer!<eos> What will the men think when they can't fight under their gods?<eos> They will lose their nerve, Maxentius will win!<eos> - No, he won't!
Oh, shoot, man, I've been in corners before.<eos> Anyway, listen, given that we're lifelong friends, I figured I'd give you about 12 hours... to get your affairs in order and say your good-byes, all right?<eos> Wait, wait. No, no, Ralph.<eos> There's gotta be a way, man. Earl, I'd appreciate it if you didn't touch me with the same hand that defiled my mother.<eos> I'm sorry, Ralph, but there's gotta be another way, man.<eos> Eleven hours and 59 minutes.<eos> [Earl Narrating] Since I knew I couldn't get Ralph to change his mind...<eos> I went to talk to the one person I knew he would listen to.<eos> Anyway, uh, I was hopin' you'd talk to Ralph and get him to, you know, not kill me.<eos> Of course I will.
Call me a faggot!<eos> Say what you want but stand the hell back.<eos> You all right?<eos> Harry,in the car now.<eos> Come on,man!<eos> Where are you going,coward?<eos> !<eos> "Jesus,I don't think you're gonna be able to get the networks to forgive its debtors.<eos> " "We should.<eos> " "We won't.
And look, the good news is, Mommy's fine now.<eos> And we'll all see auntie Nora again in heaven.<eos> Or wherever.<eos> Did they let you keep the bullet?<eos> No, no, afraid not.<eos> That blows.<eos> We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you okay?<eos> What if the crazy lady comes back?<eos> She won't.
Take a number and wait in line.<eos> I'm sure he feels the same way about you, too.<eos> I mean, don't you two have some kind of agreement?<eos> Yeah, he dates anything that moves, and I agree to smile and take their messages.<eos> And now I'm sending them flowers, too.<eos> Amanda, if you knew who he was, why did you get so involved?<eos> Because... I thought he would get sick of serial dating.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> And what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
A new flame?<eos> Do I know him?<eos> I don't think you do<eos> I will make you a bet<eos> If he stays with you, then the money is yours<eos> Wanna bet?<eos> Mousey, give her 5 million bucks<eos> I think you'll regret it<eos> If you lose...<eos> I won't
Ok, should be enough<eos> Where to?<eos> Two tickets to Taipei<eos> I wanted to ask you...<eos> Don't peak, go away!<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry...<eos> I just wanted to ask<eos> What?<eos> What if our school finds out?<eos> They won't
I was expecting a severance.<eos> Some time off.<eos> But, um, maybe this is good.<eos> Finding another job is a pain.<eos> There's another annoying boss, another desk. I'd have to learn everything all over again.<eos> So... there are reasons to stay.<eos> Hey, um... I think I am gonna take that job.<eos> And... Scranton? It's not that bad.<eos> So if they offer you a job there... I think you should take it.<eos> Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
Hey, Joy, can you help me ?<eos> Only thing that'll help your worthless-never-achieve-anything in-your-waste-of-a-breath life is if somebody drowned you in a river.<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time, sweetie.<eos> What you need ?<eos> I'm trying to return this letter for Earl's list, but the address has a Shamrock smudge.<eos> I've been asking everyone in the trailer park to help me figure out who wrote it.<eos> Well, that's easy. Earl says it's illegal to open other people's mail.<eos> That's the good thing about having three strikes you don't have to worry about the stupid laws anymore.<eos> Wish I had three strikes.<eos> You will someday. What the... ?
Kind of walked into that.<eos> The situation is coming to a head.<eos> Authorities have given Mr. Velch two minutes to leave the vehicle before they smash their way in here.<eos> At present, there is no sign of the bee. Come on, Rich.<eos> This is gonna turn really bad.<eos> If they gotta pull you out of here, you could get arrested.<eos> You could get hurt. I don't care.<eos> If I take one step out of this car, it means I'm starting my life without Lina.<eos> And I won't do that.<eos> I won't.
You know, i think we have a clip from your last cockfight. [Ling-Ling yelling]<eos> [Applause] Now, ling-Ling, what do you say to your critics Who claim that cockfighting is a cruel and inhumane sport, hmm?<eos> R, well, yeah, for you, because you're a kille<eos> But the chickens you battle Are skittish, unbelievably stupid animals Who don't even want to fight.<eos> Boy, am i talking about chickens or the french?<eos> [Laughter] right, kevin?<eos> And i pretend homeless people are you, And i burn 'em. [Laughter]<eos> Gosh, i don't know about this, foxxy.<eos> The cool kids are never going to let me play meth lab with them.<eos> Of course they will.
Oh, no, no.<eos> She sent me a mass E-mail last week.<eos> She's spending Christmas in Cabo.<eos> She would've invited me, but she knows that I don't like Mexican food.<eos> But it's not a problem because I'm having dinner over at Ryan's.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you were invited over there.<eos> I'm not... well, yet.<eos> But I'm sure he's going to ask me.<eos> Well, I mean, I hope he does.<eos> Well, he will.
Everyone has his own side of the same story.<eos> If you had believed me, Jongsook would still be alive!<eos> Of course the detective, too...<eos> The DNA tests will tell us who the murderer is.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You must still be in shock.<eos> February 29th is over.<eos> will the ghost return in 4 years?<eos> will she?
Each envelope contains a unit of hope.<eos> More envelopes...<eos> more hope.<eos> More envelopes, more hopes denied.<eos> - Some of us hold on to hope.<eos> - Boyden, Klotz.<eos> Wider path, please.<eos> The King approaches.<eos> You're never gonna tell her you love her.<eos> - I will.
No, it's just a stringy bit of meat, just there.<eos> I think I'll live with it, thank you.<eos> OK. lt's your decision.<eos> Make it a phone-in competition - 'Guess The Presenter's Lunch.'<eos> You know, it really is the oldest trick in the book.<eos> I was trying to help, Ben, but if you don't believe me...<eos> BEN: No, I don't.<eos> Eight, seven...<eos> Why not ask the gallery, then?<eos> OK, I will.
Consider yourself... forgiven.<eos> It's over... almost.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> No.<eos> But you can.<eos> - There's gotta be something we can do.<eos> - You came all this way to save me.<eos> - And you will.
None of us know our end, really. Or what hand will guide us there.<eos> A king may move a man.<eos> A father may claim a son.<eos> That man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game.<eos> Remember, howsoever you are played, or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone.<eos> Even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power.<eos> When you stand before God, you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do thus", or that virtue "was not convenient at the time".<eos> This will not suffice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I will.
- Okay. Bye.<eos> - I'll get it. - No.<eos> I got it. I got it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Want me to take it up? No. I'm okay.<eos> I'm just gonna go upstairs.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did, uh- Did you want a baby?<eos> Eventually.<eos> Well, eventually you will.
Susan!<eos> Where's Aslan? What have they done?<eos> Aslan!<eos> But we saw the knife. The Witch.<eos> If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic differently.<eos> That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery is killed in a traitor's stead, the Stone Table will crack and even death itself will turn backwards.<eos> We sent the news that you were dead.<eos> Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will, dear one, but not alone.
You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you.<eos> Until then, Willy Wonka. "<eos> The 1st of February.<eos> - But that's tomorrow.<eos> - Then there's not a moment to lose.<eos> Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.<eos> - And get that mud off your pants.<eos> - Now we must all try and keep very calm.<eos> First thing that we have to decide is this: Who is going with Charlie to the factory?<eos> I will.
I can't guarantee that they won't come after you.<eos> The Parliament.<eos> Your broadwave about Miranda has weakened their regime.<eos> They are not gone and they are not... forgiving.<eos> That don't bode especially well for you... giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt.<eos> I told them the Tams were no longer a threat, damage done.<eos> They might listen... but I think they know I'm no longer their man.<eos> They take you down, I don't expect to grieve over much.<eos> Like to kill you myself, I see you again.<eos> You won't.
He needs this-all the attention and the control- and he doesn't even know it.<eos> He needs Mom.<eos> What are you doing down here this time of night?<eos> I want to see the television cameras.<eos> You in that spelling contest tomorrow?<eos> - I don't see them.<eos> - The cameras?<eos> [Woman] I guess they don't bring them till the morning.<eos> You better get back to sleep before your mother comes down here looking for you.<eos> She won't.
- Thanks, Dad.<eos> - That went okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where's Maggie?<eos> Uh, it's hard to say.<eos> She moves around a lot.<eos> Well, I want to meet her eventually, you know?<eos> She's your sister.<eos> - I want to know her.<eos> - You will.
Sorry, Gina.<eos> I'm so sorry this happened to you.<eos> I can't catch a break.<eos> I just...<eos> I have Vanessa's recital tomorrow, and I have to go up in there with all o' this on my brain.<eos> It's okay, Gina.<eos> You'll get through this.<eos> - You'll get through this.<eos> - I wish that was true, Joe.<eos> You will.
Don't bother, Ishtar, even the dunes have moved.<eos> Anyway, I have what I need.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't want to go there anymore.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to go back.<eos> We'll go back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bab'Aziz, won't you go to the gathering after all?<eos> I will, my little angel. I will.
What the fuck are you doing there? Get the fuck up!<eos> You know, I got to thank you all... for helping me to understand what my heritage is.<eos> You see, the Wydells, they've always been vigilante justice.<eos> Now, my granddaddy, he rode with the likes of Tom Horn, killing scum like you for a living.<eos> We've always been devil slayers.<eos> See I tried to walk the line, but now I realize there is no line.<eos> We here, we are playing on a level that most will never see.<eos> I know my brother George, he didn't see it.<eos> Maybe he had a divine moment when his brains hit the floor.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you will too.
That is a huge distraction.<eos> It's unacceptable.<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> You will be busy training.<eos> And four college courses. Four?<eos> Are you out of your mind, with everything she's doing?<eos> All right, two.<eos> But then four in the fall.<eos> Only if she wins sectionals.<eos> Oh, she will.
I have to talk to the police tomorrow morning.<eos> Twig...<eos> I want you to listen to me.<eos> It's best if you grab your things and come with me right now.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yes you can.<eos> Sooner or later the cops will figure out that it was your dad who has done this thing.<eos> When they do, they are gonna lock him away.<eos> Then they will take you and put you with another family.<eos> - No, they won't.

Yuri Orlov.<eos> Fuck! You run from us?<eos> No, Mbizi.<eos> Can you run with no legs?<eos> Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine<eos> Around here, people disappear all the time.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Look where we are.<eos> Who will know?<eos> We will.
Come on, where's my fucking money?<eos> When it is delivered.<eos> It is delivered.<eos> This is not for me.<eos> This is for my neighbors to the west.<eos> The west?<eos> We're going to Sierra Leone. Oh, yes.<eos> And my son Baptiste Junior will go with you to make the proper introductions.<eos> We have no trucks.<eos> You will.
You're a sassy little thing.<eos> You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats.<eos> The trap is set.<eos> locked and ready to spring.<eos> So what?<eos> They're scum. They deserve what's coming.<eos> So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?<eos> They haven't killed anybody I know about.<eos> It got pretty bad at Shellie's place, but they didn't kill anybody.<eos> And they won't.
You won't?<eos> No!<eos> Still not going to wash them?<eos> Lie prone here.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No!<eos> Yes or no? No!<eos> Yes or no? No!<eos> Still so stubborn!<eos> You won't?
This is... this is your Czech plan?<eos> To cut me up?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you really want to be dead?<eos> For sure? This is the best time to be sure.<eos> Catch her feet.<eos> She will fall asleep in 10 minutes.<eos> - Then we will go inside.<eos> - And what if she wakes up?<eos> - She won't.
You ain't gotta dog-pile on him like that!<eos> Hey, yo, she pregnant, man!<eos> Don't forget, man, you knock this motherfucker out.<eos> He's gonna have to come around here.<eos> Djay, tell me what to do, please.<eos> Please tell me what to do.<eos> Baby, take my pad.<eos> I want you to get that shit up on the radio.<eos> You put it in the DJ's hand yourself, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
Maybe they forgot.<eos> Unlikely. He mentioned it at work.<eos> -Can't you call them?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Voice mail.<eos> What do we do, eat?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Quick shag while we wait?<eos> What if they turn up?<eos> They won't.
Oh, yeah. Course.<eos> This is mine.<eos> You got it from the staff kitchen.<eos> No, I made that.<eos> This stuff is really good for your skin.<eos> It has like all these minerals in it.<eos> - Let me see!<eos> - Let me just finish!<eos> - It doesn't match at all.<eos> - It will.
- Yeah.<eos> It's all right. It's all right. [coughs]<eos> - Listen, Kris.<eos> You're just gonna have to wait here for a minute, all right?<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> - Listen, it's just for five minutes.<eos> - Please, don't leave me.<eos> Please! - Listen. - What if he catches me again?<eos> - He won't, he won't.
- We should have bet another $200.<eos> Come on, let's go get a drink.<eos> The next day some of the others asked if we would place bets for them.<eos> Hank, we have to take their bets.<eos> Manny, those guys haven't got any money.<eos> Only the coffee and chewing gum money that their wives give them.<eos> We can't waste time at the 2-dollar windows.<eos> We're not going to bet their money, we're going to keep their money.<eos> - Suppose they win?<eos> - They won't.
Do you understand?<eos> You don't have to be scared anymore.<eos> You can stop hiding now.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Hold it, hold it.<eos> I've nowhere to go.<eos> I can't survive anywhere else, Zachary, only here.<eos> It's the only home that I've ever known.<eos> Don't let them take it from me.<eos> I won't.
- No, thanks, sweetie, I'm not hungry.<eos> - Hey, honey, please.<eos> Why do we always have chicken on Saturday and beef on Sunday?<eos> Regina can't read.<eos> Dolly-boy's mother taught her to do a different meal for each day of the week.<eos> Clear?<eos> Got it?<eos> Comprende?<eos> - Then I'll teach her to read.<eos> - The bloody hell you will.
Marta's in the hospital.<eos> Who?<eos> My wife, asshole.<eos> The one whose life I ruined.<eos> She mixed sleeping pills with alcohol.<eos> Not enough to kill herself, but enough to keep pissing me off.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Here's your ticket, I'll take the jeep.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - I won't.
I'm the mistress of the house.<eos> Did you hear how she said that?<eos> What a kind, tactful woman!<eos> I'm just happy, that's all.<eos> Alright already, we know you're happy!<eos> We get it, for chrissakes!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Too much happiness, too much!<eos> Beware of parties, they often end in tears.<eos> - This one won't.
"pasta quattro funghi", full mushrooms.<eos> Anyway, it took me a long time to realize but I think somebody put shrooms in it, all right?<eos> Or somehow they got in there.<eos> I was so hallucinating and everything..<eos> You know what amazes even me?<eos> A guy's capacity to be a world-class asshole.<eos> Fortunately, I'm familiar with the cause.<eos> Will you just please tell her I came by?<eos> No, forget it. I'll catch up with her on my own.<eos> No. You won't.
Give me that.<eos> We're feeling no pain there, and you know what?<eos> If we're at 0.1, let's have some fun.<eos> Let's double down.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, there you go.<eos> All right, keep on coming.<eos> Keep on coming.<eos> Give me three, three is well in.<eos> You give me that right now...<eos> You will?
You know, maybe it's this whole camera thing?<eos> Cameras... computers.<eos> They let you hide, don't they? So safe.<eos> I heard how your voice changed when the camera came between us.<eos> My voice changed because I felt sick because you drugged me.<eos> Yeah, you were drugged, all right.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.<eos> Go ahead. Call these models. They'll tell you.<eos> Of course they will.
Let's go in the house children.<eos> Milena, love, come.<eos> Ranka, tell Ljubo to send more sausages.<eos> As long as you've come son!<eos> Give me the plate.<eos> If there wasn't a war going on,<eos> - this would be the most happy day in my life.<eos> - I know.<eos> Take this to Milena, she's hungry.<eos> - I will.
Joe.<eos> You can't make this right by stealing her back.<eos> It's not stealing when she comes by herself.<eos> It is if we keep her.<eos> She doesn't belong to us, Joe.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Come on.<eos> She'll come back again, you know.<eos> They'll not keep her caged.<eos> -Not this time, she won't.
Thank you. Huh?<eos> That's good.<eos> One more?<eos> This is fun.<eos> Sounded a little gay, but it was good.<eos> No, no, no. no. That's it, dude. That's it.<eos> I get too many callbacks, Sylvia's going to get suspicious.<eos> Oh, Sylvia's going to be kissing your ass.<eos> Not if she recognizes your voice.<eos> Oh, she won't. Here, sir.
On the eve of your revolution?<eos> A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Tonight, I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to them.<eos> The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.<eos> Tonight, any protestor, any instigator or agitator will be made example of!<eos> Chancellor, there is a contingency that has not been addressed.<eos> And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?<eos> - Should the terrorist succeed...<eos> - He won't.
Li was told about this.<eos> That's why he broke down in prison.<eos> This was the reason.<eos> We know why you have come here.<eos> Our committee has already made its decision...<eos> I cannot give you the details straight away.<eos> Why not?<eos> Before I explain... I must clarify some things.<eos> Please translate what I say.<eos> Of course I will.
[stammers] Out of... out of fear, anger...<eos> I don't know, I was just so angry.<eos> He's... he's a great kid, you know?<eos> And he loved us.<eos> He loved... being a ranger.<eos> I'm sorry, Billy.<eos> I'd trade my life for yours if I could.<eos> Maybe he traded his life for us.<eos> [Zack] Yeah. Probably did.<eos> I would.
We're gonna draw him out.<eos> How?<eos> I copied the data from the tablet before you left.<eos> Joy's been going through it.<eos> Bakuto has been transferring the money that Gao was hiding in Rand to his own account.<eos> And now that we've been reinstated in the company, I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.<eos> - And when that happens...<eos> - you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.
She's gonna pop.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Uh-oh. - Hang on.<eos> - What's up?<eos> My mom's trying to call me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> - Oh, no, I never would.
Vaughan residence, tommy speaking.<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> No, But that's only because your boyfriend already did.<eos> Fiance, thank you very much.<eos> Seriously, who grinds coffee beans before 7:00 a.M.?<eos> So, ben is there with you?<eos> Yep.<eos> He's looking very fit.<eos> You want to say hi?<eos> I would, actually.
How do you apply for a job? You know, I've been fucking on film for the last 30 years?<eos> And it's important that you think about your future.<eos> You think about what's going to happen afterwards.<eos> I've been really lucky with-- you know, I started three Web sites as well as doing my paintings and everything, I have my auction site.<eos> So I've always got a lot of different eggs in the basket and things to fall back on.<eos> 'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.<eos> I wouldn't recommend anybody get into the business today.<eos> I just wouldn't.
That was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah, it did.<eos> Now, why don't you grow a pair and tell me why you're here.<eos> Tell me about Fred Johnson.<eos> When he joined the opa and everyone lined up to stone him, you stayed quiet.<eos> There was plenty said about him.<eos> I understand it's hard to watch a war hero...<eos> You don't understand shit about Fred Johnson.<eos> -Enlighten me. -Oh, then you want<eos> -the real story? -Yes, I would.
You're welcome.<eos> I've never seen a war between the conscious and subconscious before.<eos> Should be interesting.<eos> How is a stupid pageant supposed to remind me of feelings attached to something I haven't even forgotten?<eos> Just... dance.<eos> And trust that Elena is right here dancing with you.<eos> For the sake of argument, if Elena Gilbert weren't tied to your mortality...<eos> Would I become a vampire for you?<eos> Well, you said even if you wanted to.<eos> Oh, would you?
Once that last bell rings, this stupid town will go up in flames and everybody will go poof.<eos> Well, they'll... burn alive first, but then their ashes will go poof.<eos> You know, petty doesn't look good on a woman your age, Katherine.<eos> Oh, I'm not being petty.<eos> I'm gloating.<eos> No, you're jealous of Elena.<eos> Because you know that Stefan and I both would choose her over you every time.<eos> And she would choose Stefan.<eos> What makes you so sure of that?<eos> Because I would.

What?<eos> You think I deserve to die?<eos> No, no.<eos> That's not what he's saying.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> I'm saying maybe if we find her, we can explain to her that you're different now, you know?<eos> Sam, that won't work.<eos> She won't quit.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Would you?
Do you have any idea what that reason might be?<eos> No.<eos> No, I... I don't.<eos> I understand there was an altercation at your mother's funeral.<eos> You got into a physical fight, threats were made.<eos> Yes, I just didn't want him there.<eos> Why not?<eos> I felt that he had been bad for my mother and that he was part of the reason she took her own life.<eos> Some people are saying he blamed you for her death.<eos> Yes, well, of course he would, Sheriff.
He's on my team.<eos> Your Honor... there was never an autopsy done on Adelaide Henderson.<eos> Well, it's my speculation an autopsy would reveal she was murdered.<eos> Objection.<eos> Speculation.<eos> Overruled.<eos> But... But she did... she said "speculation."<eos> Your Honor, the People have more than enough evidence to warrant a trial.<eos> Would the defense like to make a motion?<eos> Yes. The defense would.
Destiny is all.<eos> No, no.<eos> Please, God, let this not be true.<eos> Thyra!<eos> Lady Aethelflaed!<eos> Please be alive, please be alive, please be alive.<eos> Not a single man left living.<eos> Nor woman.<eos> She is the daughter of King Alfred, they would not kill her. They...<eos> They would not.
I'd be more than happy to refresh your recollection.<eos> It seems you published it 20 years ago in a journal called the "Real Estate Investor's Quarterly."<eos> Do you remember who owned the journal at that time?<eos> I owned it.<eos> So you thought you'd share your wisdom with the rest of the industry?<eos> It was a legitimate treatise.<eos> Has it ever been cited?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I would.
I saw the light leave her eyes!<eos> Hey, Dad, who put tulips on Margaret's grave?<eos> Clearly someone who wants to torture me.<eos> Okay, don't be paranoid.<eos> I'm sure it's just a simple mistake.<eos> I chose tulips specifically to torture Larry Henderson.<eos> After all, he killed my baby sister.<eos> Plus, tulips are my wife's favorite flower.<eos> Before we unveil the headstone, would a loved one of Margaret's like to say a few words?<eos> - I would.

He's right in there.<eos> You know, according to your journal, he's Rittenhouse.<eos> In a decade he becomes a monumental ass, spews his hate across America.<eos> The way you feel about Rittenhouse now?<eos> Can't tell me it wouldn't be at least a little bit satisfying taking him out.<eos> You can't just kill Charles Lindbergh. It's not right.<eos> Look, I will go in there, I will talk to him, and I will convince him to leave Rittenhouse and not become the monster he's supposed to become.<eos> And you think he's gonna just, what, give up all that fame, the power, the legacy?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would. Okay.
- Yeah, I heard you.<eos> Does that not creep you out?<eos> Bethan was the doc's babysitter.<eos> You need to let this go, Velma.<eos> - Velma?<eos> - The dumpy one out of...<eos> Yes, smart-arse, I know who she is.<eos> I couldn't tell you the last time we saw anyone. It's the back of beyond up here.<eos> You know Jonjo Patterson's missing?<eos> No, we'd no idea.
Now, get me the name and home phone number of the Plant Manager at Hayes.<eos> What are you going.../ But before you do... Hang it./ What?<eos> You heard me. Put your deal on the board and ring... the fucking... bell.<eos> Based on what?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> This deal guarantees that we win the month.<eos> I want that production on today.<eos> Mr. Blackridge will fire me!<eos> I can't roll the dice on twenty grand!<eos> Race Bannon would.
You did see your niece, Mrs. Glenn.<eos> You saw her on that wall, at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.<eos> So what she saw was a movie?<eos> Not a movie. The movie.<eos> The movie.<eos> But the film burned up.<eos> Well, how did she see it two days after it supposedly burned up?<eos> And the wardrobe matches perfectly.<eos> So Amelia had a second print? She had a copy?<eos> Wouldn't you?
You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?<eos> Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass.<eos> I would like to speak to my son.<eos> He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.<eos> She grew up.<eos> Almost.<eos> Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?<eos> I expect it was Mother.<eos> Your mother wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, she would.
A loyalist, I'll wager.<eos> Yes, I suppose so.<eos> Of course.<eos> Trying to play the British side by having his goddaughter marry a supporter of the king.<eos> I don't care why.<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I will speak to your godfather.<eos> But he just made a decision that means you might not have to marry a loyalist.<eos> Oh, would you?
Last night, some psycho froze a cop. To death.<eos> Froze her?<eos> Yeah. Told you it was weird. Come on.<eos> Nygma's waiting for us.<eos> Frozen.<eos> Interesting. It took nearly five seconds to freeze this rose in liquid nitrogen.<eos> So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass and body fat, of course.<eos> So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.
They're still making payments every month to one person.<eos> Who's Henry Williams?<eos> I'm sorry. He's not in.<eos> What did you say this was all about?<eos> I'm not sure I did say, Mrs Williams.<eos> We just want to talk to him.<eos> That's all.<eos> I... Is he in some sort of trouble?<eos> Now, why would you think that?<eos> I wouldn't.
My husband was a money launderer.<eos> He told me he was a producer of adult entertainment.<eos> Please.<eos> Let's cut the crap, Mr. Morada.<eos> You knew the real source of my husband's income.<eos> You helped him wash it.<eos> That would be very hard to prove.<eos> What you couldn't have known was that some of that money that you and my husband laundered Tony stole from his cousin Joey Marks.<eos> Now, obviously the Armenians don't know you were involved in that, or we wouldn't be sitting here.<eos> Well, you certainly wouldn't.
I hyper-extended it. - I thought he fuckin' got suspended.<eos> - Hey!<eos> I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts. - Sorry, that's what I heard.<eos> - What'd you hear?<eos> - I heard that you got suspended.<eos> - Do I look suspended?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - He doesn't look suspended.<eos> Would I be sittin' here staring' at you two chowderheads if I was suspended?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
-What are you doing?<eos> -Just give me a second.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What? You want to find this thing and take another photo?<eos> Yell at it?<eos> This is a terrible idea.<eos> Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
What is corporal kilner's status?<eos> Been here three days, and we're short on beds.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I...<eos> You're to be the queen of all nurses, you'll need to keep up.<eos> I'm waiting on Dr. hale. Dr. hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
Mm... yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I mean, in theory.<eos> I guess I just never met the right guy.<eos> I'll try not to take that personally.<eos> I wasn't talking about you.<eos> So, if I were the right guy, you would marry me.<eos> - Mnh. - You wouldn't?<eos> No. That's not what I'm saying.<eos> - So you would.
He knew she was into girls.<eos> He didn't like it.<eos> Would he have tried to warn her off?<eos> Is that the sort of thing he'd do?<eos> I don't think she'd have listened.<eos> - He'd have had to...<eos> - He'd have what?<eos> Had to do something drastic to scare her of.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> And he wouldn't.
District Attorney Remz has taken on a new position as my deputy mayor, and I would like you to succeed him as D.A.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I think that we could do great things for this city if we worked together.<eos> Take care.<eos> Listen. Reiter's men outnumber us.<eos> We have guns, but so do they, so when we get up there, we cannot hesitate to kill, do you understand?<eos> Taiana?<eos> Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.
Hello, Donald. Oh...<eos> Hello, Margo.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry about Larry.<eos> Larry is as well as can be expected, darling.<eos> Hello, Larry.<eos> He won't be out of the anaesthetic for a while.<eos> Whatever happens, thank you.<eos> Anybody would have done the same.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Don't you see, sir?<eos> DS Rogerson is a former girlfriend of DS Arnott.<eos> Weren't you aware of the relationship between Rogerson and Arnott?<eos> No. I wasn't.<eos> You should have told him, DC Fleming.<eos> Spare the gaffer his blushes.<eos> Well, the only person known to have handled that file apart from DS Rogerson is you, not DS Arnott.<eos> Well, the pair of them must have hatched a plot to alter the file.<eos> DS Rogerson denies altering the file.<eos> Well, she would, wouldn't she?
I can bring my chainsaw over for you.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> Don't ever fucking do that again.<eos> I'm supposed to be frisky.<eos> Kidding?<eos> Frisky?<eos> - I'm gonna go in now.<eos> What?<eos> Do it again, I'll do it back.<eos> You wouldn't.
Where is she? I'll contact Burkhardt when the time is right.<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> You're still hurt.<eos> Don't make it worse.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> What we had to!<eos> Nothing from Trubel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I can't believe she would just leave like that.<eos> She wouldn't.
Welcome your offer with open arms?<eos> It's what our father would have wanted.<eos> It's what he intended.<eos> It's my home as well as yours.<eos> Since when did that mean anything to you?<eos> This is the only way to do what's right by folk.<eos> - As far as you're concerned.<eos> - No, it's a fact.<eos> Because if you don't, there's nothing to stop me taking over.<eos> - You wouldn't.
No, you have no problems.<eos> That girl up there?<eos> She had problems.<eos> - You have challenges.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> I would, though.
No, no, my lady!<eos> I can do that.<eos> Nonsense, your hands are covered in soot.<eos> What's this?<eos> A wig of this quality would cost a small fortune.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> And the color.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Did you steal it?<eos> I would never.
Do you know what the biggest difference is now than when I was raising Joy?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I'm exhausted.<eos> I just seem to remember having so much more energy dealing with a 5-year-old.<eos> Especially one who doesn't want to settle down for a bedtime story.<eos> All right... You know, it just so happens that bedtime stories are my specialty.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> Would you like to stay, David?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Rhonda, please!<eos> (sobbing): Please, Rhonda, please!<eos> Andre.<eos> Um... (exhales) I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> They're coming for us from all sides, Bella.<eos> And I want you to know something.<eos> Everything I did was to protect my legacy, - (faint, distorted shouts) - and I will do it again.<eos> Yes, I would.
- That's different.<eos> - How so?<eos> - I'm your mother.<eos> - Ma. Come on!<eos> If you wanna pass the test, you gotta do the math.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Nobody can figure out these equations.<eos> I bet the Chief Medical Examiner of the Commonwealth could.<eos> Okay, Maura does not want to tutor me.<eos> Sure, she would!
The only reason you warned Agent Hotchner about this storm is because your son had something to do with it.<eos> And now you need our help.<eos> Not as much as you need mine.<eos> Your son framed a federal agent and manipulated special weapons and tactics operatives to do it.<eos> So, here's the thing about SWAT.<eos> They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon to stop by.<eos> You aren't supposed to be here, are you?<eos> How come you're not in jail?<eos> I agreed to testify against Professor Strange.<eos> In case you're about to ask, I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.<eos> I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
Fine. Fine.<eos> Just shut up!<eos> - There we go.<eos> - No, none for the adults.<eos> - Bitch.<eos> - You tell her, New Fiona.<eos> That's New Fiona?<eos> - If the bra fits... - Okay.<eos> Out, or I swear to God, I'm gonna call the cops.<eos> You wouldn't.
I'm thinking about the baby.<eos> He's so... little and helpless and in so much pain.<eos> I know that you've had second thoughts, but it's actually a good thing you stuck with pathology.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You don't want to get so involved with patients.<eos> What if... that poor little baby doesn't make it?<eos> You're gonna feel terrible.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I would too.
How about a city that loves its people?<eos> All people!<eos> Addicts and thieves and teen boys who suck cock for a living.<eos> Holy shit. Patsy's made, like, 1,500 tonight.<eos> How'd you do in tips?<eos> - I got two bills.<eos> - Damn!<eos> Hump her on the table, why don't you?<eos> - That doesn't bother you?<eos> - Why would it?
Pretty heavy.<eos> What do you got in here, a rock collection or something?<eos> Detective!<eos> You and I both know you cannot open that bag without my consent or a search warrant.<eos> Warrant?<eos> Thought we're on the same side here, Joe.<eos> We are.<eos> But please put the bag down.<eos> You remember, Joe, when you told me that you'd do anything possible to find the animal who did this?<eos> Yeah. Well, so would I.
- Forensics found semen.<eos> The sample's already on the way to the lab.<eos> How did you get an autopsy approved for a suicide?<eos> I didn't. I got it approved for homicide.<eos> I found evidence Bella's hanging was staged.<eos> Processing the DNA at the junk lab in Red Hook?<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> Our bureau's got the best labs in the country.<eos> Yeah, didn't think I made the cut.<eos> Usually you wouldn't.
Hey, man, you hear that?<eos> Hear what?<eos> Hey, turn it up, man. Turn it up.<eos> Hey, man, tell him I sketched Uncle Riley's...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Paper Boy," boy!<eos> That was quick.<eos> Hey, man, look, you should come down here.<eos> We need to talk right quick.<eos> Like you would with a manager?<eos> No, nigga, like I would with a calm yo ass down!
"Where's the fun in them pulling your life apart?"<eos> Here we go.<eos> Tit for tat.<eos> I came to apologize... for my behavior.<eos> Accepted.<eos> You meant what you said last night?<eos> Yes.<eos> If James remembered now, if he were standing here now instead of me, what would you say?<eos> Go away.<eos> - You would?
I'm sorry about all that stuff earlier by the fire.<eos> There's... there's something I need to ask you.<eos> What did Ronnie mean when he said that I don't know what's really going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I should have told you this.<eos> So, tell me.<eos> Her pain.<eos> My mother's pain... there's a way to make it go away.<eos> Is that what's in the black bag?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why wouldn't you?
I'd love to watch the tennis, except I'm stuck here.<eos> - Man's gotta eat!<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> I have this memory of just loving him and the more I try and get it back, the more I strangle it.<eos> - And I just...<eos> - Yes, I know!<eos> We've been having this same conversation for six months.<eos> I just feel like the amount of time I spend trying to massage this relationship, I could have learnt the clarinet.<eos> Mm, and clarinets don't ruin 'Shine Bright Like a Diamond'. Mmm...<eos> They probably would, actually.
This is the Color Wars.<eos> Deb want's our help getting the kids inside.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We can handle Damon's crew.<eos> What if this Holyoke is behind it?<eos> He's been dead for a century.<eos> Look, I know you believe this stuff...<eos> If you saw what I did...<eos> What we saw...<eos> You would, too.
I can prove none of it.<eos> Those limbs once added up to a man named Jimmy Koslow.<eos> He ran afoul of a street gang-- Mara Tres.<eos> They're clients of mine.<eos> They're not concerned with courts of law.<eos> They much prefer revenge.<eos> Brutal revenge.<eos> Rey Torres was their favorite smuggler, and now he's dead, thanks to you.<eos> All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.
I am not crazy!<eos> I just canceled the night.<eos> Manny, maybe you could help out here.<eos> Mom's upset because Joe won't go to sleep and I won't go back to a party.<eos> You won't go back to a party?<eos> Why? I suffered an unfortunate series of embarrassing incidents.<eos> I just want a wine bath and to go to sleep.<eos> Listen up, Manny.<eos> Of course you want to run away from whatever happened back that party.<eos> Anybody would.
I'm close to landing the astronaut story.<eos> But it won't be an exclusive.<eos> "The Today Show" already booked her.<eos> I've got a source... He heard that David Baxter, the U.S. solder captured in Afghanistan, was beheaded.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - There may be video tomorrow.<eos> I hope you're wrong, but if you're not, we'll edit it and put it on the air. No.<eos> I don't want to air it.<eos> I'll make sure it's vetted.<eos> Julia, I'd rather not.
Listen, you need to back off.<eos> Is this some kind of state secret?<eos> It's a cartel front.<eos> Probably laundering drug money, though we can't prove it yet.<eos> So Javier Garcia's an imbed?<eos> He arrived in New Orleans months ago, been buying companies and properties all over the city-- he's probably gonna be our new focus in the investigation.<eos> Listen... you need to stay away, Percy.<eos> Dustin's in the hospital, his aunt is dead, and the man who may be responsible is off-limits?<eos> Come on, Gregorio, you know we're not staying away.<eos> And you wouldn't, either.
I WANTED TO CHANGE THE ROUTINE,<eos> AND I WANT TO GO ON EXOTIC TRIPS AND...<eos> YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.<eos> I WAS CRAZY TO THINK I COULD MAKE US CLOSER<eos> BY LOCKING US IN A CAR FOR A WEEK.<eos> NO, BUT YOU WERE DOING THAT FOR US.<eos> YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD<eos> TO MAKE THIS TRIP MEMORABLE FOR ME AND THE KIDS, AND...<eos> AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT.<eos> BUT WHY WOULD YOU?
What's this?<eos> Any officer can assign his or her sick days to another officer.<eos> Yeah, but what if you get sick?<eos> You're not gonna get those days back!<eos> Am I right, chief?<eos> You don't get 'em back.<eos> So you're scewed.<eos> You bleeding hearts.<eos> That dyke wouldn't do it for me.<eos> Yeah, she would.
Yes, but before that, you has made your mistake.<eos> And many mistakes before that.<eos> - Wait, I have not--<eos> - Many, many, many, many!<eos> Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.
- Wait, I have not--<eos> - Many, many, many, many!<eos> Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.
Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.
- Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.<eos> We could go round and round.<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> - But I would not.
Who is the girl?<eos> His name is Jess, Farhad.<eos> It is our intern.<eos> - Have you fucked?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - No, Farhad, not grabbed me.<eos> - You should do it.<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> - I would.
What's the matter?<eos> Cat got your tongue?<eos> I need water. And food.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Let's start with... A story.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about the first time you got fucked?<eos> You have been fucked before, haven't you?<eos> If you'd rather not...
Yes, yes.<eos> When I am hanged, Elizabeth will no longer be married.<eos> Soldiers will try to claim her.<eos> Yes?<eos> I want her to marry James, as soon as I am buried.<eos> Would that be possible?<eos> ~ Does she want to marry him?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> And do you want to marry her?<eos> What man would not?
Thank you for choosing Rapidline.<eos> We'll be making limited stops on our way to our final destination, New York City.<eos> Please sit back and enjoy the ride.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Aw, Jesus H.<eos> You in the service?<eos> Me too. 3rd of the 9th.<eos> Back in the day.<eos> Ah, they wouldn't want me now, even though I'd go back if I could.<eos> Yep. I sure would.
It's not exactly MOMA... But she's having a big gallery show in LA.<eos> Karen Alvarado.<eos> That's such a pretty name.<eos> An architect and an artist.<eos> You guys are like the perfect couple.<eos> And she's so hot.<eos> You must have sex, like, all day.<eos> - Bel!<eos> - What?<eos> I would.
You always liked that.<eos> .Okay- .okay-<eos> About that business...<eos> I'm looking at opening a clothes 'shop.<eos> But I need to take out a loan.<eos> That's not so easy today. I need someone to co-sign.<eos> Iwenlto see Mum, but she doesn't want to. So I thought of you. - Granny?<eos> -Yes?<eos> I was wondering if maybe you'd be willing to put up the house as collateral.<eos> 'Course. Of course I would.
It seemed like a good opportunity.<eos> That was me being opportunity.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> Well, I'm gonna figure out what happened.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> Swarek's a good guy.<eos> He's gonna want to know you're pregnant.<eos> Any guy would.
But who... who was Alice?<eos> Really?<eos> Well, maybe someday we'll find out.<eos> Or maybe we won't.<eos> Do you mind if I take that photo just to... just to make a copy?<eos> No, help yourself.<eos> - Raul lied to you!<eos> - Can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - He lied!<eos> I-I would never!
My father was gone.<eos> She was alone.<eos> But... she put me behind her, and she faced these men.<eos> They knew they could kill her.<eos> But they also looked her in the eyes and knew she would take at least one of them with her.<eos> And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
The Germans besieged us.<eos> We ran out of food and water and... .. only eight of us came out alive.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If there's anything I can do.<eos> I can't be in the store any more, not after what happened.<eos> We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> ~ Anyway, Mrs Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> ~ Of course she would.
Mrs Tabb, send for Dr Choake.<eos> I wonder you do not think of marriage, Captain Poldark?<eos> I dare say I shall, in due course.<eos> Always remembering the purpose for which it was ordained?<eos> In particular...?<eos> As a remedy against sin.<eos> And to avoid fornication.<eos> ~ We can't thank 'ee enough.<eos> ~ Any man would do the same.<eos> "Any man" would not.
Does other counsel wish to be heard?<eos> Your Honor, defense would like to reiterate that this is defendant's first arrest.<eos> He has never been in trouble before and that he has an IQ of barely functional intelligence.<eos> Would the defendant like to say anything?<eos> Charles?<eos> - Chuckie.<eos> - What?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
I... I just feel like I don't have a choice, okay?<eos> You... you have a choice, okay?<eos> We all have choices.<eos> And mine... Is to try and not stop you.<eos> You're letting me go?<eos> Honey, if something happened to Topher over there, you would blame me for stopping you, all right?<eos> You would think that you could have done something to save him,<eos> - and I... - No, no, no, no.<eos> I would never blame you.<eos> - Yes, you would.
But she may have a good reason for leaving.<eos> Or not.<eos> Or not.<eos> But you'll never know unless you look.<eos> Sometimes the best romance is not the stuff of fantasy.<eos> You sure you're ready?<eos> It's the romance of small moments. Of intimate moments.<eos> I think so.<eos> You think I should do this, right?<eos> I would.
It was difficult, I'll not deny it.<eos> You think I should accept his terms and set the date?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That's your decision.<eos> I can only say he was very moving when he spoke of you.<eos> He avoided... vulgarity, then?<eos> Vulgarity?<eos> Mr Carson wouldn't be vulgar if they put him on a seaside postcard.<eos> I'd like to feel a man could speak of me like that at my age.<eos> I would.
I never remember my dreams.<eos> How about "I want..."?<eos> I want... A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You think I'd use it to go back a few days ago... So I could save my mom.<eos> I'd go back long before that...<eos> To when the bad stuff really started.<eos> I would, too.
Really?<eos> Not even flowers?<eos> You get me flowers, I'll make you eat them.<eos> Heart on a cracker?<eos> I knew there was a reason I liked you.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> The Donahues aren't that great.<eos> We treat you pretty good around here.<eos> You don't think I'd like to lie on the couch all day and chew on an old belt?<eos> I would.
It could be that he was at the epicenter of the explosion and was vaporized, but there's a strong possibility that Keller, a.k.a. Lazarus, is still alive.<eos> Damn.<eos> I let Austin P.D. know, and we're putting out a BOLO to all the local hospitals.<eos> Wylie's putting together a k.a. list, and I'm gonna have agents set up shop at all of them.<eos> Well, did you put out a wire just in case --<eos> He runs for the border, yeah.<eos> All right, well, it seems like you have everything handled.<eos> I don't know if I should tell Jane and Lisbon.<eos> Good question.<eos> I wouldn't.
I'll be back by 2:00.<eos> By 2:00?<eos> But that's six hours from now.<eos> I didn't bring any work with me. That's good.<eos> That's the whole point of getting away.<eos> What am I supposed to do all morning?<eos> Well, I believe the technical term is "relaxing,"<eos> which I know you will refuse to do, so I've made an appointment for you to have a Swedish massage.<eos> Now, Hilda will be here in 15 minutes with her table. Then you have an appointment at Duvall's Boutique, where Clarissa will help you pick out a nice, beautiful dress for this evening. And afterwards, the beauty parlor downstairs will be expecting you.<eos> I... I would really rather not.
What's the matter with you?<eos> I'm, um, uh...<eos> Lou! Lou Grover.<eos> Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Michelle.<eos> This non-golfer here, that's Steve McGarrett.<eos> How are you? I'm Steve. How you doing?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - What's the matter with you? - If you don't mind, I just want to give you a tip.<eos> I just saw something from back there.<eos> Oh, I would... yes, please.
Were you still angry that he'd slept with Catherine to conceive the twins?<eos> Or was it about him seducing the nanny?<eos> Or was it all part of the same betrayal, eating you up inside?<eos> Do you think it was easy being the king's mistress? Hmm? A position easily gained.<eos> But held?<eos> For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, Mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open to get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.
I don't think that's a good idea with me standing next to you and all.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Kill me, if you want war the likes the Comanches have never seen.<eos> My death brings Yankee soldiers like buffalo herds.<eos> The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.<eos> Shakespeare does not translate into Comanche.<eos> He said that the Cherokee call you the Raven, but the Comanche call you Wild Turkey because you drape yourself in foolish colors and you lose your head when the coyote come.<eos> What the hell they saying?<eos> You'd prefer not knowing.<eos> I would.
That... ~ Holy Moley!<eos> ~ Wow.<eos> ~ Yes indeed.<eos> That is the 488 GTB.<eos> It has a 3.9-litre turbo-charged V8, 661 horsepower, 0-60 in three seconds.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, this is the replacement, isn't it, for the 458?<eos> ~ Yes, it is.<eos> ~ I'm just thinking, if you had a 458, you'd be feeling suicidal now, ~ wouldn't you?<eos> ~ Yeah, you would.
The DGP has sent IG Meera Deshmukh, on an indefinite leave.<eos> In its verdict on a PIL, the court has decreed... mthat if the police... mwants to interrogate Vijay Salgaonkar or his family they need court orders to do so.<eos> Vijay-<eos> Vijay, don't you think that their lives are completely ruined'?<eos> Anyway, it wasn't her fault.<eos> She was an IG and a mother.<eos> I feel as if we did the crime and she paid for it.<eos> Ifs good of you to feel that way.<eos> But, if it were Anju instead of Sam and vice versa wouldn't IG Meera try to save her son?<eos> Of course, she would.
You know, for balloons and streamers?<eos> Word to the wise.<eos> Pink, nothing but pink!<eos> Pink, Laura?<eos> Come on.<eos> Once a year, she just lets that girly freak flag fly. Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
__<eos> You know, I prefer talking to texting.<eos> - Join me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You still smell like hotdogs.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> Sort of into it.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?<eos> Wouldn't say no to a creme de menthe.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
You and I are so much more serious than Jake and Angela and I've never even considered introducing you to the boys.<eos> No, I mean... I mean, I've considered.<eos> Well, how about it?<eos> What if I come over tomorrow night, throw down my world famous grilled cheese for you and the guys, huh?<eos> Uh... I don't know.<eos> I mean, I just got finished tearing Jake a new one.<eos> I'm gonna do exactly the same thing?<eos> Okay, consider it a standing offer.<eos> The whole Jake Angela thing, I'd cut them some slack.<eos> You would?
If we aren't careful, those choices can fill us with darkness, leaving us destined to never see light again.<eos> You're getting pretty good at that. What's wrong, sweetheart?<eos> Why are there bad people, Daddy?<eos> Is this about the crash you saw on the TV?<eos> The Flight 197?<eos> I don't think that people are born bad.<eos> I think it's their choices that make them who they are.<eos> I think sometimes people convince themselves that doing something bad is okay.<eos> - What if I do that?<eos> - You would never.
I mean, it it is a little creepy looking.<eos> - The doll, not your head. - Oh.<eos> Nice head.<eos> Seriously, I felt so bad. I have Elliot in the dumpster right now looking for it.<eos> Eh-eh... - Gonna tell him to get out.<eos> You really want to make this up to me?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Hold off on that phone call.<eos> Come on, Elliot. Just give us the shirt.<eos> I would, except no.
Like you've never cased out a house from the back before.<eos> Warehouses, not houses.<eos> And that was only cos my brothers made me.<eos> I'm too easily led, that's my problem.<eos> Bless us, O, Lord, your humble servants, who give thanks for the bounty you have provided here today.<eos> May he be present at the table so that we may join in fellowship with thee, now and for evermore.<eos> Amen. And we also give thanks for the safe return of Aumea.<eos> May the journey she is about to embark upon be as blessed as the union from which she came.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill her?<eos> They wouldn't.
But when we switched places, neither of us were.<eos> So, you think...<eos> Perhaps she nicked something.<eos> The tail of the pancreas.<eos> And that could have opened the splenic artery.<eos> We're gonna have to open her up.<eos> Listen, you could find a doctor to perform 20 operations on that leg, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> I know you want to fight for this.<eos> And I would, too.
May. It's Andrew.<eos> Ward's going to kill him.<eos> You have to get to him!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Come in.<eos> Thank Fitz, but there's no reason to dote over me.<eos> Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?<eos> I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you've been doing, and I just can't understand it.<eos> After everything you've been through...<eos> - Why would you...
Yeah? You check out the delivery guy?<eos> I know the guy.<eos> He's from Vito's Neapolitan over on 12th.<eos> Delivers to my desk sergeant every day.<eos> - Neapolitan?<eos> - Are you ever not hungry?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> No, the mom said that they're gluten free.<eos> Why would they order a dough-laden pizza?<eos> They wouldn't.
No, it's not. It's real.<eos> The darkness... It's been locked away since the dawn of creation. [ Crying continues ]<eos> And now it's free.<eos> Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> [ Sighs ] I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
That's where you disappeared with all my research and my money?<eos> You brought me here to atone. I am atoning.<eos> And look.<eos> Here he is.<eos> Lieutenant, I understand you.<eos> If someone tried to kill me, I would not rest until I took my revenge.<eos> But you're not going to kill my doctor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Well, you were brewing. I was bored, and...<eos> Wow, you sure you want me to go out with a girl who lists sex as an interest?<eos> At least she didn't list it as an occupation, right?<eos> Look, she's hot, she's different, and she's getting her master's degree.<eos> She looks familiar.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her.<eos> Not that I wouldn't. I totally would.
Got it.<eos> Doesn't look too damaged.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll send the data from the black box, along with everything from the car's computer.<eos> Wait.<eos> If I'm analyzing the black box and the CAN-Bus, what are you guys gonna do?<eos> We're going to Disneyland.<eos> You don't think they're really gonna go, do you?<eos> I would.
I'll tell you what you're staring at.<eos> A mirror.<eos> No matter what you do, you'll end up just like me.<eos> Just like me.<eos> For months after that I would check my face in the mirror every day to see if it was happening yet.<eos> You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.
I can't do this.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just need to be like,<eos> "Hey! I'm a good-looking doctor."<eos> No, it would work for me, Mikey.<eos> - Would it?<eos> - Yeah, it would.
OK, I'll go first.<eos> I'm going to Tulane in the fall.<eos> Double majoring in child psychology and public policy.<eos> I'm hoping to intern at a law firm while I'm there.<eos> And then after law school, I'd like to work for a non-profit.<eos> Maybe in another country, that deals with children's issues.<eos> - You wanna work with children?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> You wanna have a family of your own?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.<eos> Allow me to explain the alternative.<eos> If you cannot bring yourself to admit that God is dead for the purposes of this class, then you will need to defend the antithesis that God is not dead.<eos> And you'll need to do it in front of this class from the podium.<eos> And if you fail, as you shall, you will fail this section and lose 30% of your final grade right off the bat.<eos> Are you ready to accept that?<eos> .<eos> Well, who would decide whether I won or lost the argument?<eos> .<eos> Well, I would.
You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, some guys came around asking where my father is.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> I have to go away for a while.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Do you know where my father is?<eos> - Would you go away with me?<eos> Would you?
I don't know who you're fucking on about!<eos> You listen to me!<eos> I want to know who you was with in that pub. Do you understand?<eos> I want to know his fucking name!<eos> Because, I swear, I'll rip your head off.<eos> - Tell me! - I don't know what you're fucking on about!<eos> Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
I'm sorry, but you just handed that one to me like a little present.<eos> Yeah, you know, we've hung out before.<eos> Anyway, your mother lent me this book a couple of months ago, and I'm just trying to get it back to her, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on.<eos> You made fun of my shoes?<eos> These are my mom's.<eos> Do you wanna try them on?<eos> No.<eos> All right, yeah, I would.
Wait.<eos> Why don't we just ask him ourselves?<eos> It says right here that Micah's in Chicago having surgery on his wrist with the team's doctors.<eos> I'll just call up his agent and set up an interview.<eos> I know how much you despise going to restaurants, so I have brought dinner to you.<eos> And I've invited Ely and his mother to join us.<eos> I made sure the caterers have made all of your favorites... the chicken coconut soup, the mint and fennel salad...<eos> Paul, that's very thoughtful.<eos> I... I'd be happy to host a dinner for you.<eos> - You would?
Sounds good.<eos> We will come by, and take a look as soon as we can.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should go to this one... alone.<eos> Why? You know what you're looking for anyway.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> It's the whole Manhattan thing, isn't it?<eos> Why would I care if you moved to Manhattan?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why would you?
Except for my personal views.<eos> Some.<eos> We were married at 18.<eos> She was the only one.<eos> And we waited.<eos> Is that what you don't respect?<eos> I spoke to you, sir, in the wrong manner.<eos> I apologise.<eos> I'd be grateful if you could see your way to putting it behind us.<eos> You would, would you?
Four years ago.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I went through this phase, thought I wanted to know where I came from.<eos> So I hired a private detective.<eos> He tracked you down.<eos> But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?<eos> Mr. Kenneth wouldn't say that.<eos> Would he?<eos> Of course he would.
How about we go fishing tomorrow?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> We can take Wilbur. We can use his sequins as lures.<eos> Speaking of Wilbur,<eos> I need to go upstairs and make sure he brushes his teeth...<eos> And takes off his makeup.<eos> We made a good kid, didn't we?<eos> We sure did.<eos> You know, I never thought I'd say this, but do you want to go to bed, grandma?<eos> I sure would, grandpa.
I haven't done anything.<eos> I'd like you to leave.<eos> I have a right to legal counsel, and you haven't presented a warrant.<eos> We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky, for abetting an act of cyber terrorism.<eos> Who's going to take care of your mother while you're spending the next three years in courtrooms?<eos> Would you please raise your arms? - No, Meechum.<eos> I know you don't want to shake my hand, so we'll just skip that part.<eos> Meechum.<eos> The President didn't mention anything about it.<eos> Why would he?
A terrorist?<eos> But she had me going.<eos> Guess I'm just a sucker for a pretty face.<eos> Look, you know you can't trust 'em.<eos> The government. The people you work for.<eos> You're just a cog in their machine. Ira...<eos> If you want to have control, I mean, make a real difference and some money, too, work freelance with me.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You know we would be a great team again.<eos> Yeah, we would.
Doesn't fit.<eos> Are you sure those are Natalie's?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, her alignment has relapsed.<eos> So Natalie didn't wear them.<eos> How long had it been since she did?<eos> Years ... two to three, at least.<eos> But we found them with her in her briefcase.<eos> Why would you take retainers that don't fit?<eos> You wouldn't.
Here I stand, there you are!<eos> Here we go!<eos> Oh, Hey there! - Didn't she do a good job?<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> We need to get her a balloon with my face on it.<eos> Yeah? I know we got slightly derailed today with the universal child care, but now we are really back on a roll.<eos> Will you come on our walk, ma'am?<eos> Someone from the vice president's office will absolutely...<eos> Catherine, wouldn't you like to go on this lady's walk?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Where are we going?<eos> Talk to Dan's friends.<eos> Why?<eos> Patience.<eos> Ah, everyone is here.<eos> Please, come on in. Take a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's been a very interesting development in the case.<eos> I'm gonna need you all to pay very careful attention.<eos> Agent Fischer, if you would.
What kind of bomb was it?<eos> Propylene oxide. The filler is typical, but the wiring is very sophisticated... multiple decoys.<eos> I'm still trying to reconstruct it.<eos> This charger is an insult, Dr. Lom.<eos> Well, at least it will give you a jolt of energy, like an espresso shot.<eos> Dude, I think you're picking Radio Korea.<eos> You'll be tip-top once the damage from solar flare is dealt with.<eos> I want to move out.<eos> He doesn't want to sleep with MXes.<eos> Well, who would, really?
And they're bound to.<eos> They're kids! And he kills her!<eos> Wow! I don't want that on my conscience.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Glad you're here, because Josh was telling me how he really feels about vampires, about me.<eos> - That's not fair... - We're not to be trusted.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.<eos> It's about my son, so it does.<eos> And you want to do anything for him.<eos> - Yes, I would!
And I've got the key!<eos> 'As I was finishing my demonstration, 'I received a message.'<eos> I've got a text.<eos> Oh, it's from the producers. Eh?<eos> Yeah, it's the first of the challenges.<eos> What happened to the gold envelope?<eos> He's a teenager.<eos> That would mean using a pen.<eos> Oh, he wouldn't have seen one of those.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
- Looks like you got - a chain gang knocking on your back door.<eos> - Bikers?<eos> - What the hell do they want?<eos> - I think they want us to pull over.<eos> - Obviously, you idiot!<eos> Why? !<eos> - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
_<eos> Are you sleeping?<eos> Yeah-- I-I don't know.<eos> But you're comfortable here?<eos> The Advocacy Center is committed to giving you anything that you need.<eos> You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> I'll turn the camera off.<eos> I think you know the Doctor's very powerful, and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Finn, I know you care about this girl.<eos> You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
Why would you want me when you can have girls like her?<eos> Who'd I give that earring to?<eos> Her or you?<eos> Let me show you something.<eos> Where you taking me, back to my shithole?<eos> - No, we gotta do something first.<eos> - I stood by you, Ray.<eos> Didn't give you up.<eos> You know I would never do that.<eos> Sure you would.
- Right.<eos> Not much here, Jenny.<eos> I thought someone saw me.<eos> Whoa, what's the matter?<eos> I didn't want you to think that...<eos> - What?<eos> - That I'm like Cammy.<eos> Don't worry, nothing bad is gonna happen to you.<eos> Unless you do get caught, 'cause then they'll want you to talk.<eos> I wouldn't.
Well, that's gross.<eos> Listen, those are Wendy, Al.<eos> You're not supposed to see those.<eos> Your fiancée sends you these?<eos> Yup. Okay, all right.<eos> What... what... what...<eos> - what if you lose it?<eos> - You can't see her face.<eos> - Nobody'd know it's her.<eos> - But you would.
Really?<eos> Uh-huh. Well, she got a point, right?<eos> I can live with that.<eos> What?<eos> Brother, I thought you were shot.<eos> I was.<eos> In my thigh.<eos> Thigh? That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
Weren't you always saying you wanted to get out of this town?<eos> That's what I always say too.<eos> But Two Horns, he's like the mayor.<eos> He's the guy we have to answer to.<eos> Maybe this isn't my last job for Two Horns, but it'll be hers.<eos> Then she can start a new life, just like she wants.<eos> Deunan?<eos> No way.<eos> She'd never go without you.<eos> Maybe she would.
Hannah!<eos> Yes, mouse, what is it?<eos> When people die, and you see them again in heaven, do they look exactly the same?<eos> Yes, I reckon so.<eos> I don't think I'd recognise Mother.<eos> Course you wouldn't.<eos> She died when you were born.<eos> How would she recognise me, then?<eos> In heaven.<eos> She just would.
but I get it.<eos> Catherine's been in the military half her life.<eos> She's doing what she was trained to do. She's not coming home until the job is done.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You've been quiet all day.<eos> am brought up the M-word last night.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He didn't officially propose.<eos> Just wondering would I consider it.<eos> And would you?
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What a miracle.<eos> Look!<eos> Shooting star.<eos> Ooh, another one.<eos> The stars are falling.<eos> It's the final sign before the Darkness said it would return.<eos> He said it would sweep the land.<eos> What would?
The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
Who are you? I'm the owner of this house.<eos> Just a heads up... the water pressure in the shower's a little low.<eos> You might want to check on that.<eos> I'll check it...<eos> Right after I shoot you.<eos> Now, who are you?<eos> I'm Christy's ex-husband.<eos> And I'm her father. Oh, really? Did you know your daughter took her family and ran out in the middle of the night to beat me out of the rent?<eos> My daughter wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, she would.
She said "leave."<eos> We could go to the judge, tell her there's been collusion between parks and Keegan, they're suborning perjury... Something.<eos> No.<eos> Maybe there's another way.<eos> She can let him walk free, just like that?<eos> How is that legal?<eos> The DA is allowed to offer whatever plea deal she wants to you or Griffin.<eos> The only way to stop that deal is to get her to rescind it.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - She wouldn't.
I have to resolve this.<eos> I'm sick of running away from it.<eos> Do you know where he lives?<eos> I think it's best you just call him.<eos> Bird, you're telling someone you like them for the first time, but you really don't wanna tell them, and you also really don't wanna even like them in the first place, but you're also wondering if they like you, too.<eos> I'm not having that conversation over the phone.<eos> I just really think he wouldn't want you to go to his home.<eos> Why?<eos> Just trust me, okay?<eos> He wouldn't.
So he died from asphyxiation.<eos> Manually strangled.<eos> You can see finger-shaped contusions beginning to form.<eos> I swabbed the neck for epithelial DNA from our killer.<eos> Already sent it to Henry.<eos> So, he was stabbed, and then he was strangled.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> That shank could have done major damage.<eos> So, why would you strangle someone if you had a perfectly good weapon?<eos> You wouldn't.
Got it, boss.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Steve Kot.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Lawyer from the state's attorney's office?<eos> I heard he went right back to work the day after his kid was killed.<eos> Is he a stand-up guy?<eos> I really wouldn't know.<eos> Olinsky would.
Dulaque?<eos> Of course that's what he's calling himself.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, quick question, Jenkins.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> If Dulaque and the Serpent Brotherhood have Santa, at least we know what happens next.<eos> Dulaque kills him.<eos> He kills Santa Claus.<eos> Ho, ho, ho. Santa was not expecting this turn of events.<eos> Santa wouldn't, would he?
The fortunes of the world... will rise and fall.<eos> But here in this... kingdom, we will endure.<eos> Legolas said you fought well today.<eos> He has grown very fond of you.<eos> I assure you, my lord... Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.<eos> Perhaps he did once.<eos> Now I am not so sure.<eos> I do not think you would allow your son... to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.<eos> No, you are right.<eos> I would not.
Picked me.<eos> And, uh, you know, once I... I made her laugh so hard, she peed her pants.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I used to be able to make women laugh like that.<eos> Come on.<eos> You made me laugh.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't make you pee your pants.<eos> Well, give it time.<eos> Hey, I didn't know her, obviously, but she sounds like the kind of woman that wouldn't want you spending all your time being sad.<eos> - No, she wouldn't.
Thank you, sir!<eos> Thank you very, very much.<eos> Say, I just wanted to ask you. What's with these here flag ladies?<eos> They done smell like shit.<eos> Oh, that's right. They are part of my deal.<eos> - Yeah, I bring them along with me.<eos> - Speaking of deals, how would you like to join Jerry Cleveland Enterprises?<eos> We do shows for county fairs in eight states throughout the Southeast.<eos> And it pays.<eos> Why, yes, sir, I would.

- It's the K-123.<eos> - That's Constantine Gubin's boat.<eos> You should be flattered.<eos> He's the most decorated hunter-killer in the fleet.<eos> 000 meters and closing.<eos> The November's lining up to take a shot.<eos> Appears our government doesn't approve of your plan.<eos> What you do not understand and what our politicians don't want to accept or face is that the Americans have acquired a first-strike nuclear capability.<eos> what makes you think they'd use it?<eos> We would.
It's not getting any easier, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.<eos> Pieces of you get chipped away.<eos> Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.<eos> I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark.<eos> He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
Don't move it.<eos> Chateau Hermitage '83.<eos> Do you know how much that bottle costs?<eos> $1,000?<eos> That might pay for the cork.<eos> This guy's probably got a million-dollar wine collection.<eos> Wow.<eos> The place is temperature controlled, fireproof probably.<eos> It's a great place to hide $10 million.<eos> I would.
To see you.<eos> To see you.<eos> To see you.<eos> To see you again.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> It's nice to see you again.<eos> # you're gettin' ready to work # it seems you got a bad connection #<eos> Hey!<eos> # no reception # what will it take to make you understand?<eos> # # bad reaction, what would... #
- Like this week, like this month?<eos> No.<eos> I like my porn, OK?<eos> I watch it every day.<eos> I always have.<eos> Maybe when I was a kid, like before I had a VCR in my room and I couldn't, but even then I had Playboys, so...<eos> - Have you ever thought about quitting?<eos> - Quit...?<eos> - You're talking about it like...<eos> No, why would I?
Or he's aware of, for that matter.<eos> But he has experienced periods of lost time.<eos> Yes, I've seen him confused at crime scenes.<eos> I've seen him disoriented.<eos> He may have been confused because he was waking up.<eos> Might not have known where he was or how he got there.<eos> Waking up?<eos> From a dissociated personality state.<eos> He would appear perfectly normal and not remember a thing.<eos> But a fractured part of him would.
- Does West know?<eos> - I haven't told him.<eos> But I'm sure he'll understand.<eos> So none of us are going to the prom?<eos> Maybe we could still go- the three of us.<eos> It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
- Nice to meet you, Faith.<eos> What are you in for?<eos> Well... it's a little personal, don't you think?<eos> Okay, well, then I will back up and make with the polite conversation.<eos> Um, what do you do in the real world?<eos> My relationship to the real world would be tenuous, at best.<eos> I hear that.<eos> You're a groupie.<eos> I prefer muse.<eos> Sure, who wouldn't?
So this week in Glee Club, it's ladies' choice, inspired by the Sadie Hawkins Dance.<eos> Which I thought of.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> Yes, thank you, Tina. And every girl will sing to whoever they want to take to the dance.<eos> Well, I, for one, love this lesson.<eos> I've got a song I want to sing to somebody.<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> Kurt, he's still sleeping. ♪ Would you like some tea?<eos> Yes, I would, but shh.
Come on!<eos> Hi, Rae!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hiya.<eos> All right?<eos> How's your hand?<eos> I'll live.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anyone would have done the same thing, you know.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
You're a "bummer brother."<eos> So... yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> This whole thing is lame.<eos> Except kitchen floor hoops, which I just invented, and is totally awesome.<eos> I know you fancy yourself some kind of rebel, Axl, but sometimes in life, you just have to follow the rules.<eos> I put on sunscreen an hour before going outside.<eos> I wait till the bus comes to a complete stop before standing.<eos> You don't think I would love to fill up on bread?<eos> I would.
♪ From my perspective ♪ I see the woman from the big jet plane ♪<eos> ♪ The woman look...<eos> Oh, yeah, you guys weren't there for that.<eos> You know, I get why they want to free up space in the storage room, but... who's gonna want any of this old junk?<eos> I'm keeping the soul patch.<eos> What's that?<eos> I remember that case.<eos> That's the pregnancy pact.<eos> You looked good in that.<eos> I still would. Ooh.
All right.<eos> Let's close up and get out of here.<eos> (Alex) You counted five vessel loops, but there was already one in that cup...<eos> The other half of the one that Victor trimmed.<eos> Just hold on a sec, everyone.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The loops were marking the vessels.<eos> They weren't squeezing them shut.<eos> So even if I left one in, that wouldn't kill the patient.<eos> Ah. Yes, it would.
She's worth talking to because?<eos> She's trimming an evergreen in the middle of winter.<eos> You're supposed to do it June.<eos> And the only thing more important than a well-maintained lawn in the suburbs is gossip.<eos> Teri was a lovely woman.<eos> Lots of people thought so.<eos> Men, especially.<eos> Uh, was there any particular man you're referring to?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't want to speak out of school.<eos> Course you wouldn't.
Perhaps it warrants a second look.<eos> You know, it occurs to me that once you've accepted my offer of an apprenticeship, you should probably start taking notes.<eos> I'm not becoming your apprentice.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Not in an official capacity.<eos> More likely you'll peddle some fiction to my father about me not being ready to be alone yet. Hmm?<eos> Whatever your pride dictates, I shan't hold it against you.<eos> You know I'm not staying, right?<eos> What? And continue your journey to profound professional satisfaction?<eos> Why would you?
(plays notes) Don't pull!<eos> Don't pull.<eos> (Burt groans, notes play)<eos> (muffled murmuring) No, no, no.<eos> That's gonna hurt! JIMMY: So we started checking TheNatesvilleCourier.<eos> After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
Hey, Jimmy's cell phone.<eos> He's not around to pick me up right now, so please leave a message.<eos> Odd, the sequel.<eos> Permission to track their phones, sir?<eos> When they're turned off?<eos> Well, I wouldn't be able to track Ducky's model of phone, but as long as Jimmy's battery hasn't been removed, even if it's dead, I can still get a trickle charge that'll power up the...<eos> His battery's been removed.<eos> According to this error code.<eos> Why would Jimmy do that?<eos> He wouldn't.
Well, he admits that he was at her building last night but says that he didn't actually buzz up to her apartment.<eos> Well, let's see if Sarah's DNA shows up in his SUV, and if the rope matches.<eos> Maybe Sarah's stalker showed up last night?<eos> Hey, I think I got something.<eos> I checked out the deal memo and corporate structure.<eos> Sarah had a controlling interest in the company,<eos> - but now all her shares are sold to Jen.<eos> - Sarah didn't want to sell.<eos> She didn't get a chance to sign the deal memo.<eos> Or maybe she wouldn't.
I told you we're not supposed to hang it out there.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Liz Fletcher.<eos> Luckily they spared me the stripper.<eos> Probably thought I was so old it would've killed me.<eos> Remember that stripper at your leaving do?<eos> She was uncomfortable.<eos> You know, didn't fancy the idea of stripping in a bar full of coppers.<eos> Who would?
Oh. Yes.<eos> So I really didn't know Ricky but I felt him.<eos> These are his ashes.<eos> He's charred, top to bottom<eos> I'm gonna pass him around.<eos> Feel free to snort a little of him.<eos> It was epic.<eos> The mic is now free if anyone would like to talk.<eos> Anyone?<eos> I would.
Doesn't mean that she's not the murderer, okay?<eos> It just means that she didn't use this.<eos> I think you're reaching, Booth.<eos> Our assumption was that the victim was strangled at the top of the stairs... and then tossed over the railing.<eos> But Finn and I tried that every possible way.<eos> The yellow fractures show the injuries from the simulated falls, and the red show the actual fractures to your victim.<eos> We couldn't match the same fracture pattern that we found.<eos> What if the body dropped at a 90-degree angle?<eos> Well, how could that be possible if she was thrown over the side?<eos> It wouldn't.
To what end?<eos> We may not strike at Jedediah Shine or Silas Duggan through him.<eos> We may not strike at those men at all.<eos> What, then?<eos> Say, imagine, we might, you and I, walk into a chophouse on the Commercial Road and in that chophouse we... lay our hands up on the shoulder of the man the world made<eos> The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.

What a great story.<eos> Men In Black.<eos> The psychic predicted her own murder?<eos> The killer's a zombie.<eos> I said "almost always."<eos> But in this case, we're not trying to catch our killer.<eos> Fosse's already dead.<eos> You know what bugs me?<eos> Why would a guy on a bombing spree be worried about selling his baseball card collection?<eos> He wouldn't.
Neither am I.<eos> Rachel?<eos> Can you come in for a minute?<eos> You called Gayle Hudson at BNC, right?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Then we're all set up for tomorrow night, prime time?<eos> Thank you, Rachel.<eos> Tell Fitz he has 36 hours to convince me, in person, that he regrets the unfortunate choices he's made and truly wants to recommit himself to his wife and children.<eos> If he doesn't, he will have the pleasure of seeing the First Lady of the United States call her husband a whore-loving bastard on national television.<eos> You wouldn't.
Annoyingly, so am I.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> What do you think I mean?<eos> It's not a very complicated word.<eos> Don't you want to be Lady Aysgarth and rank alongside your daughter?<eos> Lord Aysgarth, I'm modern.<eos> I don't hanker for those days before the war.<eos> And I don't really want to spend the rest of my life among people who think me loud and opinionated and common.<eos> But I assure you, they wouldn't.<eos> Ah, yes, they would.
I'm going home to my brother.<eos> After I say good-bye to Rose.<eos> Where did, um where's her body?<eos> I don't know if you heard about Lester Coggins, but no one took over the mortuary since he passed, so Linda had to leave Rose... in the Sweetbriar kitchen.<eos> What?<eos> I know it's a shame, but it's just until she can get buried.<eos> Here.<eos> I want you to take this and go see her.<eos> You have a key to the diner?<eos> Well, I'd better.
That's nine years ago.<eos> And this is why you couldn't meet me at the florist?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> What I can't understand is how you can maintain such a willful disinterest in your own engagement party.<eos> What?<eos> Honestly, Mina, it's like talking to a man sometimes, nose buried in whatever silly thing has captured his attention.<eos> Lucy, what's wrong?<eos> I hate this.<eos> Lucy, I... I don't understand.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
Four years ago.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I went through this phase, thought I wanted to know where I came from.<eos> So I hired a private detective.<eos> He tracked you down.<eos> But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?<eos> Mr. Kenneth wouldn't say that.<eos> Would he?<eos> Of course he would.
Doesn't sound like me.<eos> I saw you break down, Crowley.<eos> When I was trying to cure you,<eos> I know a part of you was human again, maybe still is.<eos> Blah-blah.<eos> Boo-hoo. Done?<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause this is what I know.<eos> I'm not giving you anything.<eos> Why would I?
You know, I want someone to be happy.<eos> - Maybe I'll just call Paul.<eos> - No!<eos> No, that is the worst thing you can do.<eos> Really?<eos> Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.<eos> Would you, you sweet, sweet man?
Who are you?<eos> I'm not sure we're ready to be on a first name basis.<eos> I want to meet face to face.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You're one of us.<eos> Why are you hunting down your own kind?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Someday, this war between our species is going to end.<eos> And when it does, I'd like to be on the side that's still standing.<eos> Wouldn't you?
I got him.<eos> ♪ The echo to your yell<eos> ♪ The ripple to your dive<eos> ♪ The currents under your wave<eos> You're Julia?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're frightened.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I could come to visit you, if you like.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Oh, my god.<eos> We've got to stop her and try to talk her out of it.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> - Visiting hours are over.<eos> - Oh, please?<eos> I need to tell him something before I lose my nerve.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Oh, there must be something you can do.<eos> I-I mean, I'm sure that a hard-working, but poorly paid man like you probably wouldn't take a bribe.<eos> I wouldn't.

Don't take it out on him.<eos> Yeah, well, I think he knows better now.<eos> Too bad you don't.<eos> You have any idea what he just did for you and the club?<eos> Gem, Gem...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He needs to know.<eos> What?<eos> D.A. wanted him to give you up.<eos> He wouldn't.
And remember the most important part... it's the "wisdom to know the difference."<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was really inspiring.<eos> - Super inspiring.<eos> - Totally inspiring.<eos> Beyond inspiring, wow.<eos> Sean, I hope you were listening to what Blake had to say.<eos> I gotta be honest, I tried, but I'm still pretty buzzed from breakfast because I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Okay, who'd like to share next?<eos> Sean would.
Hi, Morgan, pleasure to meet you.<eos> I'm following up on a report from your OB/GYN, Dr. Marsh.<eos> She noted bruising on your arms and legs.<eos> Like I said, I just bumped it in gym class.<eos> Can you show me the bruises?<eos> Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> Had.<eos> How do you two get along?<eos> He's never laid a hand on me.<eos> Ever. And he never would.
Anthony really liked your ass.<eos> I know what Antonia and I had.<eos> This is what we had.<eos> That's what we had.<eos> Well, that's a lot.<eos> But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that, and it's a shame too, because I had a great eulogy.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Would you like me to share it with you?<eos> I most certainly would.
Got enough respect for myself.<eos> But I do not want them to beat me.<eos> They're never gonna beat you.<eos> They came close today.<eos> I'm going in that Phillies dugout tomorrow and I'm gonna wring Ben Chapman's neck!<eos> Did I say something funny?<eos> When I first told you about Robinson, Harold you were against it.<eos> Now, all of the sudden you're worried about him.<eos> Wonder how that happened.<eos> - Why, any decent-minded person would... - Sympathy, Harold.
He got passing grades.<eos> He hoped one day to become an architect, like his father.<eos> But that dream is gone.<eos> Snuffed out because like so many typical teenagers,<eos> Parker decided to try something that he saw on TV.<eos> On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> If there's anything you wanna talk about... maybe trouble with Stacy, or...<eos> Yeah, 'cause you'd love that.<eos> He's not answering my texts, my tweets, my e-mails, my voicemail, my Facebook messages...<eos> Do you think he'll tell his father?<eos> No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> What about Danny?<eos> Do you think he'll tell the authorities?<eos> - He'd never.
Absolutely.<eos> Uh, we're gonna work through it, but<eos> Debbie, uh told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way--<eos> Who's Tom Petty?<eos> You know who Tom Petty is.<eos> And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to "F-up his pussy ass."<eos> Which is what she said.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I would never. To a child?
We'll call you back in.<eos> Would you stop staring?<eos> You're driving me crazy.<eos> -Likewise.<eos> Stop clinging!<eos> Want a beer?<eos> As long as it's cold.<eos> You seeing someone?<eos> Would you like to see my new tattoo?<eos> Would you?
If you love someone, you don't inhibit or shackle them.<eos> Besides, if he's seeing Rai, Bruno tells me.<eos> Deep down you're like your mother:<eos> resigned to it.<eos> I accept this situation because I want to!<eos> I'm free!<eos> My father ignores my mother. And me!<eos> Bruno doesn't ignore me.<eos> He loves me!<eos> Why wouldn't he? With all this understanding?
- All right, I love you.<eos> See you soon. Yeah.<eos> Hey, a quick one while they're away? Come on. For old times' sake.<eos> You know what? You're hitting on a married woman.<eos> - I know. What's your point?<eos> - Yeah. You really want me to sic my husband on you in the state he's in?<eos> You're right. That kind of thing could lead a man to drink.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And then his glorious mangina might make an appearance. Wouldn't want to see that happen, would we?<eos> Actually, I would.
Girl?<eos> Aren't you, like, thirty?<eos> Closed!<eos> What in Gaia's name are you doing?<eos> Going for nuance.<eos> No.<eos> You cannot touch the sacred tree.<eos> I guess my bite is worse than your bark.<eos> You... you wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
I've got rumors she might be talking.<eos> And you can't fire her.<eos> Not without a nightmare on our hands.<eos> Look, as yet, she hasn't gone to the press.<eos> It'd like to put a stop to it before she does.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Makes me look like a dirty old man.<eos> I have to ask.<eos> No.<eos> I never, I would never.
So that's what this is about.<eos> Come on. You're a rich guy.<eos> You can afford to give them time<eos> - to make up one month's, right?<eos> - You're right. I could.<eos> - So great.<eos> - But I won't.<eos> I have a fairly specific rental agreement.<eos> If they miss a payment, I'm within my rights to evict. - Oh, come on.<eos> Why would you--
So I've burned my bridges with VR, and now you're telling me I'm no better off than I was before?<eos> Look, talk me through what you heard when Doyle was inside the van.<eos> I told you what I heard.<eos> You mean did he shout, "Argh, my chest hurts?<eos> , I think I'm dying"?<eos> Er...<eos> What if I'd opened that door ten minutes earlier?<eos> Or even five?<eos> Would it have made a difference?<eos> Well, would it?
"ln order for the demon to enter the host,<eos> "the Hittites believed three stages had to be completed.<eos> "One..." Are you listening?<eos> "Actuation.<eos> "The host will begin to exhibit signs of pre...<eos> "Preternatural ability."<eos> Robbie's been doing that.<eos> Been doing that a lot.<eos> "Affirmation.<eos> "The host would...
You know it's unjustifiable. You don't care.<eos> You are the definition of evil.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> Okay. We're going to sell this ring for just $3795.<eos> How is that?<eos> I just read the day shopping networks make their money on the day seniors pick up their social security checks.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> Alright, you shouldn't say things like that, cause a host of a jewelry channel may up and do it.<eos> You would feel bad.<eos> No, I wouldn't.

Ashur?<eos> He must have been there that night, when your brother fell.<eos> Yet the villain moves only upon command of Gaius Claudius Glaber.<eos> Much has been lost.<eos> The ones we have loved.<eos> The ones we thought would forever be at our side.<eos> But in their passing, the chains that bound us to desires not our own have been struck.<eos> And without such a blow, we would not find ourselves in each other's arms.<eos> No.<eos> We would not.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You're out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Ahem. Uh, now that, uh, we're all here,<eos> I'd like to make a toast to, um, to Jerry.<eos> He was a good man and a good cop.<eos> I never got to tell him that.<eos> So, um, I'd just...
Mmm! This is the best barbecue you will ever taste, Trav -- guaranteed.<eos> Well, look who it is.<eos> Look, I'm not looking for any trouble, man, so why don't you just take off?<eos> Really, tough guy?<eos> You like telling me what to do, hmm?<eos> No. Actually, I don't.<eos> There's nothing I really like about you.<eos> Where's your girlfriend?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I would.
I don't want a birthday if he's lying dead.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> He's in Glasgow.<eos> I meant...<eos> You are surely not in love with Christopher Tietjens?<eos> You mustn't be.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> But when he comes home, he will make me his mistress.<eos> Or he won't.<eos> But you wouldn't!
You have to do my hair, today.<eos> [Chuckles] I'm booked.<eos> Yeah, yeah, there's always room if the price is right.<eos> What do you charge?<eos> $30.<eos> Look, we're not gonna get anywhere if you insist on joking around.<eos> What do you charge?<eos> If your blow outs are as good as I think they are, you could be charging ten times that amount.<eos> Oh, people wouldn't pay that.<eos> Of course they would.
I love you!<eos> I think I do, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
I doubt it.<eos> Ben, you don't know that you burned down the school. Oh, no.<eos> We know we burned down that school.<eos> How many other people were in there making s'mores?<eos> And her dad works in the security business, he set up the security system at that school and he hired the security guard.<eos> Her dad knows the security guard.<eos> You told me all this last night, I'm not going to sleep with you again this morning.<eos> Maybe I should just go in there and confess.<eos> Tell my dad what happened. No. If Dylan's father knows anything, you think he's going to rat out his own offspring?<eos> My dad would.
I'm sorry you've wasted your time, detectives.<eos> I don't know anything about insurance fraud, and that is not my signature.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Okay. Go ahead.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Look, I liked Susan, but it's not inconceivable that she forged the signature<eos> - and fudged the insurance on her own.<eos> - Well, maybe she fudged something else, like this mysterious engagement to someone a couple days before she was murdered.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know who that was, do you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'm coming with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Lew, thanks for helping.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry about all this, Bobby.<eos> It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
Let's go.<eos> Call me, let me know what happens.<eos> So?<eos> You ready to do this?<eos> Already helped C.I.B. process three bodies.<eos> Now I'm going over reports from last night, see if there's anything I should carry over.<eos> Wow, way to work it.<eos> Well, I just don't want people thinking I got this promotion because I'm sleeping with Jerry.<eos> No one's gonna think that.<eos> I would.
And I dove in and I broke a vertebrae by diving in.<eos> AUDIENC GROANS You've also been run over?<eos> I have been run over, yeah.<eos> I was 19 years old, I was in Vancouver and I was at a bar,<eos> I had a few drinks, I'd left my car and I decided to walk home.<eos> Being responsible.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I was crossing the street, it was about two in the morning and I was hit by a drunk driver.<eos> LAUGHTER I always wondered if he tells people that he got hit by a drunk pedestrian.<eos> LAUGHTER I would.
It happens to a lot of guys.<eos> Well, it doesn't happen to me.<eos> It was probably just something you ate.<eos> You know, the body is a real mystery.<eos> Even scientists don't understand the way it works.<eos> I have been eating a lot of soy lately.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I really picked up the slack in there.<eos> That does not make me feel better.<eos> Would it help if I told you we could barely hear you yelling at your penis in the bathroom?<eos> It would not.
' Believe me, I am with you 100%.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> I'm embarrassed for them, frankly.<eos> I mean, who are they to judge you?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Eat it.<eos> Have it.<eos> It looks nice.<eos> Why wouldn't you...?
Stop it.<eos> Then, in a moment of weakness, the thick sexual tension became something much more real.<eos> I said stop!<eos> And Caroline has no idea.<eos> Hello, Damon.<eos> Klaus, where's Tyler?<eos> Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...<eos> He wouldn't.
I should be dead.<eos> I was dead.<eos> I was standing in my kitchen, chopping garlic, talking to my husband, and then I started convulsing.<eos> He calls 9-1-1, and by the time the paramedics got there, my heart had stopped.<eos> They shocked me three times and took me to the ER, and...<eos> Dr. Wilder.<eos> He brought me back.<eos> He did 20 minutes of CPR, shocked me three more times.<eos> He didn't give up on me.<eos> He just... wouldn't.
He's not ready to be put out to pasture.<eos> He's not there yet.<eos> He's not even close.<eos> You know, he forgot to send in his renewal.<eos> Big deal.<eos> Dad?<eos> I don't want to talk about it, Sonny.<eos> Okay. And I'm pissed at all of you.<eos> That's why I left. I just want to calm down.<eos> I'd just like a few minutes to myself.
- No.<eos> I can't believe that pregnant is no longer crazy.<eos> I don't want to stay in Tokyo.<eos> I hate it there.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "And then when I got pregnant, I was just like, "Get me the fuck out."<eos> But your blog looks so happy.<eos> I don't think my Mom would read it if it were about depression.<eos> My Mom would.
Looks more like he got a manicure than had a beef.<eos> So, what is this, I'm grounded?<eos> We got everybody up on the O.C. wires trying to find out more details, but for right now, yes, you are confined to this house.<eos> For how long?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> Do I have a curfew?<eos> Can I stay up and watch Jon Stewart?<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> No, I think it's ridiculous; you wouldn't do this to any other cop caught in the same situation.<eos> I damn sure would.
And I was wearing my cords.<eos> Don't wear cords.<eos> Enjoy your brecky.<eos> - Reycraft.<eos> - Busy.<eos> Reycraft, listen.<eos> If I needed some time off, would you cover me?<eos> Mat leave?<eos> Who's your baby daddy?<eos> Seriously, would you?
Takes maybe 20 minutes.<eos> ICBM's faster, but you gotta launch it up and down. That takes time.<eos> And you better be 100% sure you kill her, 'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.<eos> And once the "Colorado's" tridents are airborne, there is not a thing in this world that stops them 'cause somebody kept my daddy from building star wars 20 years ago.<eos> So tell me exactly how you would take out that submarine?<eos> Linus.<eos> What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie. - Oh, relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
OK, I'm counting three lost causes, anyone else?<eos> Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.<eos> Yeah, got it on the sensors.<eos> The Asylum has a force-field.<eos> The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to turn it off.<eos> Soon as I do, they'll burn this world and us with it.<eos> So, Oswin, my question is this.<eos> How fast can you drop the force-field?<eos> Pretty fast.<eos> But why would I?
No bridge?<eos> We're gonna have a 6-minute song.<eos> I think we have to have a bridge.<eos> Do you have any orange juice?<eos> I got some vodka.<eos> You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually...<eos> I would.
How did that rabbit just talk?<eos> Um... Fred has been studying ventriloquism.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I might do it professionally.<eos> You're being ridiculous. Stop it!<eos> Sit down! You should be nicer to your son.<eos> It's just a thought.<eos> Who wants to hear a song?<eos> We'd love to sing a song for you.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Uh, you know, I feel that we've spent a lot of time today talking about these standardized tests, and I think we've already acknowledged the system is failing us.<eos> And if we continue to just keep looking at these tests and focusing on these tests, then we will fail our students.<eos> And if we keep pushing those kids towards the ever-important test score, we're pushing them to fail.<eos> It seems naive to presume that these test scores don't exist.<eos> I don't mean to presume that they don't exist, but the students have very different needs.<eos> And we have a responsibility to see what those needs are and to address them.<eos> What would you have us do?<eos> Sit down with every student in the state?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
So, how'd the lecture go?<eos> In a word, triumphant.<eos> Really?<eos> Triumphant? Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people.<eos> Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom.<eos> I may have changed a few lives today.<eos> Oh, please let me tell him.<eos> I don't know, I kind of promised Howard. Tell me what?<eos> Actually, we should all share the moment.<eos> Raj, if you would.
And Social Services have paid the first month's rent on a great apartment starting next week.<eos> I think I miss my husband.<eos> You mustn't call him for at least a week.<eos> All right, Nicki, you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved.<eos> This is crazy. And this isn't the time.<eos> There is no right time or wrong time to save someone in need, Barb.<eos> And it's important to me that our children know we feel that way.<eos> But she wants to go home.<eos> She doesn't know what she wants.<eos> Who would?
Maybe nine-mil.<eos> Brime County issues nine-mils.<eos> What the hell are you people doing here?<eos> Detective Lucas Martin.<eos> I saw you at, uh, Steve Jackson's wedding last year.<eos> You know Jim Brass-- you two worked the Anne-Marie Tolsom case.<eos> You ever hear of professional courtesy?<eos> We're on the trail of Anne-Marie's body.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> Well, I damn straight would.
This is all going to be pretty straightforward.<eos> Always tricky to estimate that, isn't it?<eos> Simpler these officer-involved cases look, the more surprises seem to pop up.<eos> I've seen plenty of claims of self-defense turn out to be cold-blooded murder and a life sentence in Ely.<eos> When do I talk to CSI Langston?<eos> Well, let's give the guy a couple days.<eos> He's been through the wringer in two cities...<eos> You saying you want to delay?<eos> We all want to put this to bed, Detective, Langston included.<eos> Who wouldn't, in his situation?
- Bye.<eos> She's lying.<eos> - Haddie's lying?<eos> - You think?<eos> Yep, I think she's lying.<eos> I think she's going to see that boy Alex.<eos> Wait a minute, we don't know that she's lying.<eos> You know, she needs a consequence because she lied.<eos> Okay, if she's lying, she needs a consequence, or she's just gonna keep lying.<eos> I would.
I don't want to turn bitter.<eos> - l worry for Frank. I care about him.<eos> - Well, I'd stop.<eos> No.<eos> I love Frank.<eos> I always will.<eos> If that's the case, why not fight for him?<eos> - Against Priss?<eos> I'd never win.<eos> - Sure you would.
Where are you going?<eos> Grab some dinner. Then back to bed.<eos> You know your way out, right?<eos> Paige? Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> You have every reason to hate me.<eos> I don't even know why I'm here.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I would.
Duncan.<eos> They probablyjust moved out because of all the building work.<eos> No, bodies started turning up.<eos> Ripped to pieces.<eos> Well, why did no one do anything, then?<eos> These are homeless people, Connor.<eos> No relatives, no one to look out for them. The authorities don't care.<eos> Listen, if there was a creature out there, then we'd already know about it, believe me.<eos> How?<eos> We just would.
Or we could search the rest of the property now and keep an eye on things while you get married.<eos> Great.<eos> And what the hell, you're all invited to the wedding. Oh! Yay!<eos> Excuse me, where's the exit?<eos> Anything?<eos> Clear.<eos> She looks different.<eos> She's happy.<eos> Do you think she's told him?<eos> Would you?
Yeah, that's not really his style either.<eos> We have to tell him.<eos> We've told him all we can.<eos> We can't even tell him we've seen his future self.<eos> He's interacted with his own past.<eos> It could rip a hole in the universe.<eos> Except, he's done it before.<eos> And, in fairness, the universe did blow up.<eos> But he'd want to know!<eos> Would he?
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Pretty cool party.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> "Cool."<eos> Okay. All right, not the most original of openers.<eos> Let me try this again.<eos> Would you like to go grab a cup of coffee?<eos> So?<eos> Would you?
There were 17 in total, virgins.<eos> There were 17 in total, all of them apparently virgins.<eos> It was abhorrent for me to watch and, if I know Peter, he would've found it deeply degrading.<eos> I was banging away till dawn.<eos> - Peter, don't be so crude!<eos> - Sorry, Judith.<eos> He was rutting away till dawn.<eos> Fortunately, after eight or nine hours, Peter was spent and the high priestess very kindly gave us a lift back to the airport.<eos> I must say, for as long as I live, I would never go back there.<eos> I would.
Either Greco-Roman or Freestyle, whichever he chooses.<eos> You're twice his size.<eos> Yes, well, he could have committed adultery with another person's wife.<eos> He chose mine.<eos> I'm not going to go back to my client and recommend he wrestle you.<eos> Okay, well, then, I guess you're just gonna have to call the police.<eos> Or I just go down now and get her.<eos> - That wouldn't go well.<eos> - No.<eos> It wouldn't.
You love her.<eos> She's family, Which means she's supposed to be here, no matter what,<eos> Even if you say you don't need her Or don't want her to know that you do.<eos> Ah, don't listen to him.<eos> He's very dramatic.<eos> I want you to come live with me.<eos> You'd hate it.<eos> So would I.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> And neither would barry or the boys.
Whatever is happening, how can you not say anything to the people who love you?<eos> - Why would you-<eos> I told you not to worry about me.<eos> - Oh right, your note.<eos> Josh, did you ever think that the one thing not to say to Jewish parents is "don't worry"?<eos> Please.<eos> Please, just tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - You wouldn't underand.<eos> - Try.<eos> - You wouldn't.
It's there. I know.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> You are listening to me.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> This time... we do it your way.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, Peter. No.<eos> No. No, the FBI is not gonna pay for your combat training.<eos> Think about what I could do for you guys if I knew how to fight.<eos> No, I'd rather not.
Ethan, we're trying to solve a murder.<eos> Go take your 4-H project somewhere else.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> The manure wasn't from the horse that Bryn was riding, Sherlock.<eos> So someone else rode a different horse out to the crime scene.<eos> Yes, and he ate something shiny.<eos> Glitter.<eos> Somehow he ingested it.<eos> Why would a horse eat glitter?<eos> He wouldn't.
You don't know anything.<eos> You'd just be repeating gossip.<eos> Violet Slater's husband heard him bragging in the pub.<eos> Gossip.<eos> Do you want to destroy your son's marriage?<eos> - I'm not the one in the wrong.<eos> - You will be if you tell Paul.<eos> Wouldn't you want to know?<eos> In his situation?<eos> Wouldn't you?
He says you may have damaged your spine.<eos> How long will it take to repair?<eos> We can't expect them to put timings on that sort of thing.<eos> But he did say it would get better?<eos> He says the first task is to rebuild your health, and that's what we have to concentrate on.<eos> I see.<eos> And he says there was no reason why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life.<eos> Just not a very mobile one.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> I would.
2001, 10 years later<eos> - Don't drink too much.<eos> - Yeah, yeah. Get home.<eos> Is that Won-gil's brother?<eos> That's Won-seok.<eos> Now, it's the kids that nag, not the wife.<eos> He's grown a lot.<eos> I wouldn't recognize him.<eos> If we met our lost sons on the streets, - We wouldn't recognize them.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
Hell, I would have taken revulsion, any emotional engagement at all.<eos> It's no wonder Cuddy broke up with you.<eos> Folks, Chad Lockerbie just won first place in the chili cook-off.<eos> Congratulations, Chad.<eos> That cocoa powder really did it.<eos> Dumped in a field in Schenectady.<eos> Ouch.<eos> You mind if I make a move ?<eos> I know she's out of my league, but she's at a spud gun contest with the soon-to-be five-time runner-up, so she's probably got some self-esteem issues.<eos> You wouldn't.
The only ones who liked it were the teachers and moms.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That's our audience.<eos> We've got our next show!<eos> Rallo, you boys are going to be on TV.<eos> What?<eos> ! We'll be the laughing stock of Stoolbend!<eos> We're not doing it.<eos> Oh, you're doing it, or I'll sign you up for the summer reading program.<eos> You wouldn't.
Did you happen to bring anything of hers that we could get DNA from?<eos> Well, everyone on the project mapped their DNA into the database.<eos> I'll need that information.<eos> You know, on this first victim, the more I work on this skeleton, the more I question its condition.<eos> The ocean floor preserved the other remains remarkably well.<eos> I think something else caused this.<eos> Could this be the age of these bones as opposed to the others?<eos> Well, he's significantly older.<eos> Arthritis in the joints puts him in his late 50s, but that doesn't account for this degree of breakdown.<eos> In fact, nothing in the ocean would.
I told you, Adrian should be the one to work things out with Amy.<eos> Either way, they should work it out.<eos> Just so we can have the stupid shower?<eos> No, not so we can have the stupid shower.<eos> Because they're friends.<eos> And are you and George friends now?<eos> [scoffs] Come on, Grace.<eos> George is George.<eos> You wouldn't... Cheat on Jeff?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
He's even sideways through that.<eos> BMW only bringing 450 1Ms to Britain, 300 of them already sold.<eos> OK, hard on the brakes, penultimate corner, still very greasy out there.<eos> Into Gambon and there he is across the line.<eos> I have the time here.<eos> It did it in 1 minute 25 dead so, even though it was a damp track, it was faster than an M3.<eos> Very good, but hang on, because I think there was a bit of film there we didn't see. No, there wasn't.<eos> There was, from the final run.<eos> I think the audience would like to see it.<eos> No, they wouldn't.

Yeah, it kind of is.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Call the police?<eos> I'd be happy to tell 'em the whole story<eos> About how you hired a struggling actress To pretend to be your daughter<eos> So that she could gain access to your real daughter's trust fund<eos> Just so su could take the money for yourself?<eos> I think the authorities would have a problem with that,<eos> And your family would, too.<eos> You wouldn't.
Did you kill her?<eos> Well, this is really going to disappoint you, Harry, but no.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't like her.<eos> Bet you didn't want to hear me say I'm innocent, did you?<eos> Because a conviction would only prove you failed.<eos> An innocent man in prison for the rest of his life because of your incompetence.<eos> Imagine having to live with that.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> You would.
Like you want another chance?<eos> -Yes. -So in hindsight, do you regret putting yourself in that position?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Well, you risked your own salvation for a man that ultimately didn't care about yours.<eos> So be it.<eos> Do think that in some way had something to do with your father abandoning you and your family?<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> -l think that's a stretch. -Perhaps, but you said yourself if he showed up today you'd welcome him back into your life.<eos> -l didn't say that.<eos> -So you wouldn't?
Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's awful.<eos> Is this him?<eos> I lost my dad suddenly, too.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Let me, uh, let me make you some breakfast. Oh.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> No, I-I would...
Why can't I keep a secret?<eos> Look, we were thinking...<eos> There is something you could do, maybe, to, like, make it up to him.<eos> Yeah. You could always offer to, you know...<eos> What?<eos> Make it up to him.<eos> You can't feel that bad, then.<eos> Yeah, if you felt that bad, you'd at least think about it, wouldn't you?<eos> Would I?<eos> I would.
Jim and i developed a good partnership moving forward.<eos> But numerically,it doesn't seem completely straightforward that we're going to be able to get rid of elyse because right now it's jim and i on board to vote for elyse.<eos> There has to be somebody else willing to do this or else we're screwed.<eos> i mean**<eos> Ozzy.<eos> I was talking to,um,jim,and i don't think jim's fond of getting rid of ozzy.<eos> Who is closest to ode?<eos> Elyse?<eos> I think she's in ozzy's back pocket.<eos> would***
- What's your theory?<eos> He's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment in which children like Bailey Shelton and others are repeatedly abused.<eos> Josh is a protector type.<eos> His power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.<eos> We believe that's when everything shifted.<eos> Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.<eos> There's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.<eos> Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.<eos> Why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?<eos> He wouldn't.
Don't look so worried, Merlin, I don't really think you want to kill me.<eos> Aconite.<eos> Wolfsbane to you.<eos> The deadliest poison known to man.<eos> What was it doing on Arthur's food?<eos> Merlin took some from here earlier.<eos> He was really angry when he realised Arthur wasn't going to eat it.<eos> He has been behaving very strangely.<eos> Why would Merlin want to kill Arthur?<eos> He wouldn't.
- Wait.<eos> We don't do it to who? Shh!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> First of all, I don't understand why you bring this guy's race into it.<eos> - There's 40,000 cops in this city...<eos> - Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just tryin' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> - Yes, I would.
- Ah!<eos> What are you playing?<eos> - Bach.<eos> Ah, yes. I do not.<eos> I play in a piano bar.<eos> I have no ambition in this field.<eos> It is only to ... buy paint.<eos> Where do you play?<eos> I would like to go to listen.<eos> You'd rather not.
Do you want to be in the queues or do you want to be on the rides?<eos> You want to be on the rides, don't you? You want to be on Nemesis, Oblivion.<eos> Rubber Dinghy Rapids.<eos> - Yeah. You with me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Rubber Dinghy Rapids.<eos> - Yeah, Rubber Dinghy Rapids.<eos> Right? - OK, I would kill you, brother Omar.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
I offered him more than I got.<eos> And he won't listen to reason.<eos> But they're gonna kill her.<eos> I know this is hard, but there is nothing I can do.<eos> I'm sorry, Carrie.<eos> Flicka helped heal my broken spirit.<eos> And has become part of my soul.<eos> She embodies all that is pure and true.<eos> I would do anything to save her.<eos> So would I, Katy.
You know what that means?<eos> It means you gotta do it for yourself.<eos> Being the underdog with nothing to lose is the best place to start.<eos> I'm doing pretty good at the moment, you know. Yeah?<eos> I got one or two proper deals on the go.<eos> Money owed.<eos> I got a nice penthouse in Old Victoria, I'm happy with me digs.<eos> You should come and see me.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Would you?
Your fallopian tubes are scarred here and here.<eos> We usually see this form from a pelvis infection that was once untreated. What was once untreated?<eos> -Should we talk alone?<eos> -No, it's okay.<eos> An untreated STD can cause this issue.<eos> is there a surgery or something that we could... I honestly wouldn't recommend it.<eos> It's very risky. Right. Okay.<eos> Excuse me. Thank you, Doctor. Babe.<eos> -Babe. lt's okay.<eos> Would you...
She wants to place a big order for a birthday party.<eos> I can not get involved in this stuff Twelve.<eos> Can I give you her number<eos> - Mike White stop. You're full of questions.<eos> You want something nice, or not?<eos> Give her my number.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It is a famous party.<eos> And I will be famous.<eos> Would you?
Daddy's the son of the sheriff in a town with no crime.<eos> Mommy has an important job at the bread factory,<eos> And daughter Emma is the brightest bulb<eos> In her first grade class.<eos> Eat 'em.<eos> Mommy and daddy still sneak off for smoochy-smooch, Despite the fact that they've been together since prom.<eos> So tell me, Emma.<eos> Why would we trade any of that<eos> To go to a place full of earthcakes?<eos> We wouldn't.

The opposite sex has no sense whatever when it comes to their limits.<eos> They must be constantly watched, least they harm themselves in the simple act of being men.<eos> Wait.<eos> Domina.<eos> How did you fare with Spartacus last night?<eos> Was his cock of impressive size when engorged?<eos> How many times did he have you?<eos> Huh?<eos> Speak. He would not have me.<eos> He would not?
What would you do?<eos> If you paged me during sex?<eos> About the contract with AtlanticNet?<eos> I got them to come up to 8%, but we should get at least 12.<eos> It's all numbers, do the math, and nothing else.<eos> It's not about my pride, it's about the principle.<eos> They're trying to screw us over because we're small.<eos> That's what they're supposed to do. They should be pressuring other hospitals to be more like us, not trying to make us more like them. It's stupid.<eos> And putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?<eos> You would.
Ben, come on.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Good looking pant.<eos> Not the right cut for you, though.<eos> I think they look good.<eos> They're exactly what you wanted.<eos> Yes, because I'm a fucking moron.<eos> No, you're just a little insane, 'cause you hate everything you ever done.<eos> No real guy would wear these.<eos> - I would.
We'll have a location in two minutes.<eos> Roland Pike has dodged the Marshals Service, the FBI, and the mob for over five years.<eos> He's already dumped the phone.<eos> Doesn't bother you, working for spics?<eos> See, the spics we got here, they're mostly wetbacks with no papers.<eos> They pick lettuce all day, live like 30-deep in some rat-piss apartment or else, like, you know, homemade tents out by the highway.<eos> Point is, they ain't running shit. - No.<eos> - "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
And if it helped, great.<eos> I've listened to the dog and pony show.<eos> I have seen the drawings.<eos> But to bring Dalton into it, no.<eos> But why is our son still in a coma?<eos> Why can't the doctors tell us what is wrong with him?<eos> How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here?<eos> Don't you see, Renai?<eos> You want to believe.<eos> Anybody would.
Well, now I laundered your clothes.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> That's an odd combination, when you think about it.<eos> I mean, if you think about it.<eos> You must be Duke.<eos> Milk...<eos> One sugar, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, and why would you know how I take my coffee?<eos> I wouldn't.
The tumor has compromised the organs to the point<eos> - where anything we do to remove it...<eos> - Will kill me.<eos> Audrey, you're not even listening to them.<eos> It doesn't make sense. I just want one more month.<eos> I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
Well, look, since you don't want to talk, let me just ask you this... is there something that might make you feel better?<eos> I mean, not talking, not chocolate... Uh, I don't know.<eos> Um... Well, I see something.<eos> Um... it's Fife.<eos> It's Fife, okay? I don't even know how I feel about him, but, uh, he kissed me yesterday.<eos> And, uh, well, you asked if there was something<eos> - that would make me feel better...<eos> - So go with feeling better.<eos> I... I couldn't.<eos> I wouldn't even... I...
- Ugh! - Forgive me, Miss Lane.<eos> This tyke has followed me over brook and dale.<eos> I can't seem to shake her off.<eos> Oh, but look at her!<eos> She is the loveliest little creature!<eos> She seems to think you are her master, Thomas.<eos> Who's a fine lady?<eos> Who's a splendid lady?<eos> Would you like a drinky of water?<eos> Would you?
We must be rigorous in our consideration.<eos> Perhaps tomorrow might be a little warmer.<eos> I could take her out then.<eos> But we do have a moral responsibility to seek out her owner.<eos> Of course we do and so we will, my dear.<eos> I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
You're a virgin?<eos> Can you drown me now, please?<eos> Yeah. I think I have to.<eos> We have a very strict "no virgins" policy here.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, I'll leave soon.<eos> So, what else?<eos> You know, the whole thing you said about, you know, feeling in the moment,<eos> I wasn't feeling in the moment at all.<eos> Why would she?
I've been through it.<eos> Marshall's been through it.<eos> A lot. And it never gets easier.<eos> That's nice to hear, huh?<eos> So what do I have to look forward to, more of this?<eos> Feeling like a fat, stupid, ugly nothing?<eos> Dom, come on.<eos> No, hey, everything my uncle said is true.<eos> Who'd want me unless I paid, right?<eos> And who would? Huh?
I mean, how could he do this to her, how?<eos> I don't know, the same reason any other guy does it to their wife, you know?<eos> Low self-esteem.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They take those little blue pills that make their things go...<eos> It's not genetic, okay?<eos> 'Cause I would never ever... do that to you.<eos> I didn't even think of that.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, well, of course, I would never.
I think, um...<eos> I think what Samson's trying to say is...<eos> Have the courage to say goodbye.<eos> Is that it?<eos> And what do you think of that, Vincent?<eos> I-I think maybe it's a good idea.<eos> Better to have loved and lost, eh, Vincent?<eos> I-I wouldn't know.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
That's what girlfriends are for.<eos> Okay, I can get the top part...<eos> Stay, stay, stay!<eos> Stay! No, please, do not...<eos> It maybe be actually very contagious.<eos> I may have to hurt you massively.<eos> She'll do it.<eos> I may have to hurt you.<eos> I would do it for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't!
Okay, I can get the top part...<eos> Stay, stay, stay!<eos> Stay! No, please, do not...<eos> It maybe be actually very contagious.<eos> I may have to hurt you massively.<eos> She'll do it.<eos> I may have to hurt you.<eos> I would do it for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't!<eos> Yes, I would!
No, no.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, uh, Chloe said she wanted you all to herself tonight.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she said something about wanting to catch the early show at the Clova.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancee?<eos> He'd better!
I know bad people.<eos> - This kid isn't bad. - He's a punk.<eos> Show me some bodies, then we can talk. Quiet, guys.<eos> I want to see if she bites.<eos> See if she's still worth saving.<eos> Ames, we do this, it's over.<eos> We can live whatever life we want.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Of course she's gonna do it.<eos> I would.
Nate, I'm sending you all the data that Hannity has on that project.<eos> Okay, look, I just punched into the laboratory storage database.<eos> Not only does Dr. Frankenstein have some of that UG99 nightmare fungus stored in a biohazard vault here at the Wakefield, but, like you said, she's keeping it in a canister that matches the schematics that Archie was given.<eos> Looks like somebody was trying to jump-start an outbreak.<eos> Oh, this... this virus, this what-do-you-call-it, gets out and kills the normal wheat.<eos> That's right.<eos> And famine everywhere. I mean, it's a multibillion-dollar market ready for Wakefield to dominate.<eos> It's so arcane, brutal.<eos> She'd have to be a monster.<eos> Yes, she would.
You know, there's nothing wrong with me as a person.<eos> I'm smart, I'm funny,<eos> I recycle!<eos> I just want to learn to control my eating, you know, and not keel over in a White Castle drive-through like my dad.<eos> And it was his third lap.<eos> That's it.<eos> Oh, and I would love to be able to walk into a nightclub without having every queen in the room leaping on me like I'm a Gay Pride float.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who wants to share next?<eos> I would.
In the car!<eos> And it's definitely, especially not fair on them.<eos> And what about Rita?<eos> I mean, she's with us all the time, Dave,<eos> - and she always will be.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love Rita, you love Rita. What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work".<eos> She would.
I was going to tell you.<eos> When I thought the time was right. How could you...?<eos> Look, it's my business, all right?<eos> Well, why'd you lie to me?<eos> I didn't lie to you.<eos> You've got your pride when it suits you, but this whole time you're running around with that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're deserting me.<eos> I would never...
It's Paul!<eos> If you're in the middle of affair sex right now, could you please put your clothes on so we can talk?<eos> Sorry for yelling.<eos> I didn't want to barge in on you and your lover out of respect.<eos> I'm big on respect.<eos> Let's get a dictionary and look that word up for you.<eos> I'm not having an affair, Paul.<eos> That's what everybody who has an affair says in the beginning.<eos> Trust me, I wouldn't even know how to get an affair started.<eos> Sure you would.
Virginia, you're gonna need to come back here. I don't... I don't...<eos> I don't think I can do this alone.<eos> Your family's amazing.<eos> You actually like this?<eos> I love it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And your mother, she doesn't even realize that she's the craziest one of them all.<eos> This is great.<eos> I may never leave.<eos> Why would you?
He's in his room, talking to his hap girlfriend on skype.<eos> We took care of the vigil.<eos> We rescheduled it for next week.<eos> I... killed him.<eos> I could not... Stop myself.<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
Hang on.<eos> Look at this.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Eric, somebody sawed off the tilt lever here.<eos> Which means the wheel would be locked in place.<eos> The steering wheel's at a weird angle.<eos> The airbag didn't deploy.<eos> Someone was definitely trying to make sure the baby got hurt in the collision.<eos> Why would a carjacker go to this much trouble?<eos> He wouldn't.
Indian.<eos> It can't be overdrawn, mate.<eos> I put a cheque in five days ago for 22 grand, so it can't possibly...<eos> Say that again.<eos> Tony's cheque bounced.<eos> No, nothing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He wouldn't do that to us.<eos> He wouldn't.
- This is terrible.<eos> It's what de Klerk got, plus an increase for inflation.<eos> Today President Mandela announced that, in his opinion...<eos> - Thanks.<eos> ...his salary is too high.<eos> Dead right.<eos> They're all overpaid.<eos> He has, therefore, decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity.<eos> Give me the houses and cars they give him, I'll donate a third of my salary too.<eos> - You would not, not in a million years.
Minds.<eos> - - No, I do not know.<eos> - - Stop playing with us.<eos> What the fuck you know?<eos> You said that we're in this together.<eos> This blade is ... specifically created to cut skin and muscles.<eos> It's a knife for human flesh.<eos> "Unbelievable" "Imagine your"<eos> He really wants to do that.<eos> Why would it?
He was changing.<eos> - But he wasn't dead. -<eos> You put a fucken bullet in his head.<eos> Tony. He was part of the family, dammit.<eos> Waste her. Get it over with.<eos> She did the right thing.<eos> - Fuck off! -<eos> Put your feelings aside, cop!<eos> We need everyone.<eos> He wouldn't.
Hey, you want a Coke?<eos> - You got a Coke?<eos> - Give the kid a Coke.<eos> - I don't want a Coke.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want you to take me back to New York with you.<eos> Take you back?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Son, I'd like to do that.<eos> I really would.
Fine, but I win every "my mother's a fucking horrible person" contest.<eos> To mother issues.<eos> You're lucky, Marshall.<eos> Your mum's there for you.<eos> Look what she made you.<eos> Hey, Nordic.<eos> I just read in Us Weekly that Lance is dating one of the Olsen twins.<eos> Which must be total vindication for Sheryl Crow.<eos> I mean, that guy is just gonna fuck everyone, isn't he?<eos> Hey, I would.
At least that's what some of the guys at work told me.<eos> That's what all you macho guys talk about?<eos> No, hey, it's cool.<eos> It's not like it used to be.<eos> Everybody talks about it.<eos> It's on television. You know.<eos> The male body's the "in" thing, right?<eos> I hear a guy can get a blow job real easy around here.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> You wouldn't ?
Yes,I took Cal flying a few times.<eos> Without the kids?<eos> This one here is my favorite.<eos> This particular flight to New York.<eos> You were gone the whole weekend.<eos> All right.<eos> All right,I'll tell you what you want to know.<eos> No,my husband didn't know I was having an affair with the Kings' manny.<eos> Would I have killed Cal to prevent him from finding out?<eos> No,I would not.
You're afraid of me. I can't say I blame you.<eos> - You tried to kill me.<eos> - Kim, please. I don't expect you to trust me. But you have to know that hurting you in any way... is the last thing in the world I wanted to do.<eos> - Then why did you do it?<eos> - I'm so sorry, Kim. I-<eos> - I panicked.<eos> At that moment, if you'd gone to the police, it would've been the end. For me, Marian, for my children. And I'm not talking about prison, you understand?<eos> They would've killed us all.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would?
All right. All right, then.<eos> Just try and be still.<eos> So you've seen stuff like this before, right?<eos> A patient with a 4-inch blade in her head?<eos> No.<eos> There is a knife in your brain.<eos> -Right, yeah.<eos> -By some miracle, you're still alive.<eos> If you're gonna get stabbed in the head, you picked exactly the right spot, but, then...<eos> -...you would.
This one's on the house, Darwin.<eos> You consider it a welcome-home gift.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> What did you do?<eos> What the fuck did you do?<eos> Nothing. I didn't do anything!<eos> You made her do this.<eos> You killed her.<eos> No. No, Tom, I would never.
There.<eos> - Is that your shot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> - That's it.<eos> OK, here we go.<eos> One more. Lovely.<eos> Have one of me and Freddie, eh?<eos> you'd better not hurt my daughter again, do you hear me?<eos> - I wouldn't.
- I can't smuggle...<eos> - Don't give me "can't".<eos> You're gonna have to try harder or you're the one who's gonna tell this chick it's not gonna be fried!<eos> You look into its sweet, innocent face and say:<eos> "I'm sorry, Penny,<eos> "we're out of trans fat!<eos> You won't be fried today!"<eos> Because I will not do it.<eos> - How'd you like to get that bunny?<eos> - Would I?
Like swarms of locusts they descended<eos> Their aim to make the town folk flee<eos> They've got to be here somewhere.<eos> Where's my first lieutenant?<eos> Here I am, sir. Yes, sir.<eos> Right indeed. Here indeed. Yes, I am, sir!<eos> I want you to turn this settlement upside down until you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson!<eos> That fat bastard thinks he can steal my bride and get away with it?<eos> I wouldn't bet a corn farthing on him escaping.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
From cancer? But if you jumped over it, then...<eos> Doesn't mean I don't still get it, Charlie.<eos> Sometimes I think that the things I've done, maybe I've sped up the date.<eos> - It's my fate, Charlie. - Come here. It's my fate.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Wish I could tell you I found every hole and patched it but no such thing as perfect security. Perfect, no.<eos> But is it sufficient? The damn thing is tricky.<eos> Can't know for sure, not really.<eos> - Who would know?<eos> - He would.
The car.<eos> It used to work, and then it stopped.<eos> We've got the ceremony on inside if you wanna watch it.<eos> You look like you know what you're doing.<eos> My dad taught me.<eos> Is he around?<eos> He died in the war.<eos> You need a new hose.<eos> Will that take long?<eos> A new one would.
- He doesn't like cops.<eos> - And what are you, a fed?<eos> - I'll take that as a yes.<eos> - Lieutenant Platko...<eos> You may not know Jimmy, but your daughter does.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
Of course you did, sir.<eos> The act of a gentleman.<eos> You know who pinned those on me?<eos> Yes, sir, i do.<eos> I'd like to pin them on you, tom.<eos> It's been authorized, and it's a fact if you will accept.<eos> It would mean leaving the unit.<eos> Unit's a colonel's billet, tom.<eos> Would you like to think about it?<eos> Yes, sir, i would.
Lynn, hello.<eos> Dr. Atwell, you've never met the baby's father.<eos> This is Lee Scanlon.<eos> Lee, nice to meet you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> So... 20 weeks.<eos> First ultrasound.<eos> Do we want to know the sex of the baby?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I would.
Great!<eos> I can't believe.<eos> You were ready to kiss him?<eos> Long kiss goodbye.<eos> Both from his family and his career.<eos> Either that or to let me pass the exam...<eos> With compliments.<eos> - You think he would agree to that?<eos> He is tricky.<eos> - He would.
He was just lying there.<eos> So you wanted us to think it was Riley.<eos> So that your son's death would mean something, make a difference.<eos> Otherwise everything was for nothing.<eos> Is that why you joined the Neighbourhood Watch?<eos> Got yourself beaten up, cos you thought it would make a difference.<eos> My son...<eos> Your son walked away when he found out what Riley did.<eos> He could've stuck with it, be rolling in it.<eos> Most fellas would.
Okay?<eos> She used to sing you the song about elephants.<eos> We were happy.<eos> She wouldn't kill herself.<eos> You gotta believe me.<eos> She would never kill herself.<eos> Agent, the surveillance you wanted is ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She wouldn't do it.<eos> She just wouldn't.
I would be thrilled.<eos> Thrilled.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Pretty sharp, huh?<eos> No.<eos> Girls, I'm telling you, are not into the flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Would James Bond use a cane?<eos> No, he would not.
Ever. Even yourself.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was just thinking out loud.<eos> What? I wasn't listening.<eos> What's his name?<eos> - Dan.<eos> - Dan.<eos> Can I meet him?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
I'm sorry.<eos> Stuff happens.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What time did Lee get home?<eos> Same time as every night, about half past midnight.<eos> My husband did not do this thing.<eos> If he went into jail, what would happen to the kids?<eos> They'd go into care.<eos> And he wouldn't do that to me.<eos> He wouldn't.
- And why is that?<eos> Every time I look at that pool table, I keep seeing you on it and then I can't think about anything else.<eos> - What do you say we get out of here?<eos> - And go where?<eos> Well, we'll sneak out the back and shift, and run and play.<eos> Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work right now, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't slap me with a harassment suit for telling you this but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> - Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
What do you want to do, Nak?<eos> I want to kill him.<eos> Look, he could give us Sachi's murderer.<eos> And then he goes free?<eos> The man who put my sister's head on a spike?<eos> If we don't cut this deal, then... her murderer could walk.<eos> It's your case, Booth.<eos> What I want doesn't matter.<eos> To me, it does.<eos> And it would to Sachi.
Really great.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Really heartwarming.<eos> OK, last one.<eos> The lucky bride-to-be has to... Kiss a girl.<eos> It has to be a real kiss.<eos> Tongue optional.<eos> What a wimp.<eos> - Like you'd do it?<eos> - Maybe I would.
Why does he always fail?<eos> Just for how long does he want to be a drain on my pocket?<eos> That's so disgraceful, we mustn't talk to anyone about that.<eos> Here we go again!<eos> You too!<eos> Becoming pregnant with sixteen... and then you're coming back here!<eos> I don't want to have that child, too!<eos> There are still so many things I want to do.<eos> Then have an abortion.<eos> I would, but... 120.2.2.
- Oh, hey.<eos> - Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?<eos> Not a lot.<eos> That we always have the option of going back to being friends.<eos> - Is that what you want?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.<eos> I guess.<eos> - It would take the pressure off.<eos> - It would, wouldn't it?
Dr. Robbins--<eos> I said no.<eos> Dr. Shepherd is operating On the inside of man's spinal cord right now.<eos> Even the most minor disturbance could cause him To make a mistake on that patient, A patient who happens to work here and whose life<eos> So no, you don't get to go in there and be a bully.<eos> Not today, chief. Not on my watch.<eos> Okay, I totally thought that was gonna end different.<eos> Yeah, more like that.<eos> Dr. Bailey, care to fill us in?<eos> No, I would not.
Can you imagine what that would feel like?<eos> So the father loved horses and lost his head to alzheimer's.<eos> Gabing, gabang, headless horseman.<eos> You got your ghost.<eos> Ok, but I had a vision Of the father seeing the ghost, Like he was being haunted by the horseman.<eos> Or a projection of the man's own fears.<eos> Ok, so is that what's galloping around town right now, his fears?<eos> Or his rage.<eos> You said he didn't take the diagnosis well.<eos> Um, would you?
Something happened with Jimmy, something so bad that she blocked it out.<eos> Good morning, Nai.<eos> Oh, I hear you hired a new doctor.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm sorry. No, yes.<eos> A... a doctor has been hired.<eos> And he's great, and everything's going be great.<eos> If you could erase bad memories, do you think everything in your life would better?<eos> There's some things in my life I'd like to erase.<eos> Yeah, wouldn't we all?
Is it his fault that Lee got eliminated?<eos> She depended on her looks too much.<eos> Boss, boss.<eos> I want to quit.<eos> I'm not desperate enough to kill and keep shooting.<eos> Why, you wanna report this?<eos> You just stood and watched that's a punishable offense.<eos> You've changed so much while you were away.<eos> You think you wouldn't change?<eos> You would too, with enough money.
You tell me.<eos> I just want the keys to that truck and I'm gone.<eos> No one gets hurt.<eos> Don't worry, they're not gonna shoot us.<eos> I'm not sure about that.<eos> Call them off, Malcolm!<eos> Go ahead, shoot the kid.<eos> He's willing to die for his cause.<eos> Is that what you want, Jay?<eos> He'd rather not, Malcolm.
Me, neither. Recital hall must be a dead zone.<eos> Auditorium at school has a scrambler To stop cell phones from ringing during a performance.<eos> I bet they got the same thing here.<eos> How could wait phone his mom from the auditorium door, If it's a dead zone?<eos> And look-- check this out.<eos> Walt said the fire trucks came here, On university av, but the fire station<eos> Is there and the lab is there.<eos> Yeah. But garden av is a direct route.<eos> Why would the firefighters go the long way around?<eos> They wouldn't.
I'm freaked out.<eos> Damon attacked me. I could be dead right now.<eos> - But I'm also grateful. - Hmm?<eos> - To Stefan.<eos> He saved my life. - Mm.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Not since he told me he was leaving.<eos> For all I know, he's already gone.<eos> He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.<eos> Yes, he would.
- Right about now I am.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Zero, back to the car.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us.<eos> Conversation's over.<eos> Playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher,<eos> I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.<eos> And you would know, huh?<eos> - I would.
Did I say you should go?<eos> I didn't say you should go.<eos> The night's young.<eos> Apparently so are you.<eos> Let's see what happens.<eos> Sean Allison.<eos> You wouldn't do it.<eos> For that kind of money?<eos> You're gods damn right I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Laugh.<eos> So where are you gonna be sleeping?<eos> Are you staying with Charlie?<eos> Because, you know, I don't care.<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't even tell me.<eos> You can sleep with whoever you want.<eos> Betty, no. Of course not.<eos> I would never do anything like that--<eos> Darn right you wouldn't.
-l hope so.<eos> Are you really gonna marry Mistress Boleyn?<eos> Whatever the consequences? Whatever her history?<eos> Why do you ask, Charles?<eos> What do you mean, "whatever the history"?<eos> Henry, I have it on very good authority that she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.<eos> She fornicated with him on many occasions. Sometimes brazenly entering his chambers at night.<eos> I've heard those rumours.<eos> She denies it.<eos> Well, she would, wouldn't she?
- No!<eos> - But I thought that was...<eos> - It would be blamed on my master.<eos> At the moment, he doesn't need that.<eos> He has a war with the Turks to contend with.<eos> - But why should anyone ever know?<eos> - Don't be stupid, Brereton.<eos> They would find you and torture you,<eos> - and you would tell them everything.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
- So why doesn't this one have armor?<eos> Except for its tusks and its size, this looks like a piglet.<eos> Wolfgang!<eos> Here, boy!<eos> Wolfie, is that you?<eos> Hey, Brooks. You got a camera on your cell phone?<eos> Take my picture.<eos> Fuck you. Hey.<eos> You wanna see how this is done? Get in close.<eos> I wouldn't.
We wanna confuse the police with this identical twin thing, restage the robbery on the chemist with one of you in custody as Paddy.<eos> Crime?<eos> Mercy!<eos> Exactly the same job, but with Paddy inside he'll have a definite alibi!<eos> Means it might not have been him the first time, creates a reasonable doubt!<eos> They'll never get a conviction.<eos> What about me?<eos> They'll be seeking a lookie-likie.<eos> Why not try twinnie?<eos> I would!
I didn't know Val was gonna put it round the entire nick.<eos> She's the biggest gobshite of them all!<eos> I thought she was a sweet old dinner lady.<eos> - Yvonne!<eos> Open the door!<eos> - A good sarge knows her staff.<eos> I can tell you the names of everyone who works at our nick.<eos> Fine.<eos> But do you know them?<eos> - A good sarge would.
But she says that hearing you admit that you knew what your boyfriend was doing, well that's a start.<eos> And I think...<eos> I get the impression that despite everything... your daughter loves you very, very much.<eos> - Hey, Mum, look, I've finished.<eos> - It's lovely, Debbie.<eos> In a bit.<eos> Norma, would you pop upstairs and wake Mum?<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - No!<eos> Norma, would you?
When she picked up a violin, it was like she already knew where to put her fingers.<eos> Your uncle, on the other hand, never figured out what his talent was, except trouble and mischief.<eos> My parents said the most ridiculous thing.<eos> But, like, you never have proof, and you just want some sort of proof.<eos> That's exactly what it was like, you know. And then it just turned out to be really funny, so I wanted to show you guys.<eos> I mean, he thought that his life is, like, really dramatic...<eos> I thought you were on crack when you showed us that.<eos> It's, like, why would you waste your time videotaping...<eos> Simon, you want to get that?<eos> Why would Simon...
The more the merrier.<eos> you know,you and tommy d really got it figured out,trine.<eos> The guy has no idea how luckhe has it with you.<eos> Susan,hi.<eos> You two get settled in okay.<eos> The best that we could.<eos> Our old furniture barely fills half the new house.<eos> Maybe you could give my wife some decorating tips.<eos> Sure.Call a decorator.<eos> who'd up for a harvey wallbanger.
I don't know if it's healthy.<eos> I'm sure he's harmless. She looks harmless but that's all Birdy can ever talk about since the lesson.<eos> Jenna this and Jenna that.<eos> Mom, I've got a man crush on Brad Pitt.<eos> It doesn't mean I'm gay. I just want her to have a normal childhood.<eos> I don't think it's bad to be gay.<eos> I'm not saying it's bad. I just don't think I want Birdy to be like...that.<eos> Life would be easier for her if she wasn't.<eos> I sure as hell wouldn't want any a son of mine growing up queer.<eos> Jim! Well, I wouldn't.
Please.<eos> Bye.<eos> - No, I can't leave him with you!<eos> - Alex, if you have...<eos> - He'll be fine, I have a daughter.<eos> - I know, I know!<eos> And you could be such, such a wonderful mother!<eos> So wonderful!<eos> But I don't remember a boy turning up!<eos> And surely I would!
- with stuff.<eos> - Like social hierarchy and that sort of thing.<eos> - No, that's not what I meant.<eos> - Sure.<eos> So since you can't back out of the mixer, you want us to.<eos> Which is fine.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> Well, you know, it's not what you think.<eos> Our social calendar is really limited, and we have to consider our entire year when we make plans.<eos> Any smart social chair would.
We just needed to draw the dragon to the general area.<eos> Once here, she and the Fire Dragon will find each other.<eos> Come, we have to move quickly.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> There is an abandoned farm up ahead, where we can hide.<eos> I can't find Luisa.<eos> Did you ask her maid?<eos> She hasn't seen her since last night.<eos> She wouldn't have gone out knowing the danger.<eos> Wouldn't she?
But dangerous, leave it to me.<eos> I led the team while you were away, Jack.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> He knows you too well, he'll never tell you the truth.<eos> Three rules.<eos> One: don't believe anything he says.<eos> Two: always keep him in front of you.<eos> And three:<eos> under no circumstances let him kiss you.<eos> As if I would!
So we can spend more time together.<eos> Quiet evenings at home. -Cuddling on the couch.<eos> -That's good. Good, good.<eos> Devon. What's really behind the washer and dryer?<eos> -So we can spend more time together.<eos> -What?<eos> No more Laundromats.<eos> We come home and go onto a run without worrying about dirty shorts.<eos> I never go running with you.<eos> Maybe you would with a drawer full of clean jog bras.
Whoever said men could read maps?<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> After everything's Steven's done you're still willing to risk your life for him.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Lester asked me to assess everything that might interfere with the team's efficiency.<eos> I thought Steven's affair with Helen would've come into that category.<eos> So, he's sent you here to spy on us?<eos> I prefer to call it management appraisal.<eos> I should leave him up there to die because of what happened with him and Helen?<eos> Some people would.
Any word?<eos> I spoke with the neurologist.<eos> Her spine is broken in three places.<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> Arthur.<eos> What Nathan said about Linderman...<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Come on, Angela.<eos> Linderman wouldn't dare go after Nathan on his own.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Why did you kill her?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't kill your daughter.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Right back at you.<eos> So,crocotta,huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> That would explain the flies.<eos> Yeah,it would.
And of course, that kind of decision has an effect on others.<eos> You and your sister - you were separated when your parents died, weren't you?<eos> You entered the chaos of the care system and Jess went to live with Aunt and Uncle.<eos> Who raped her and called the neighbours in to hold the camcorders.<eos> Incredible what goes on behind the net curtains in this nation of ours.<eos> Robert and Abi, though, they seem contented little kids.<eos> I'm sure they'd rather be together, with your sister.<eos> Is he fast?<eos> Cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he takes a couple of steps.<eos> I would, too.
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.<eos> If it reaches the conduit, it will have access to virtually unlimited power.<eos> - And what would happen?<eos> - The growth would increase exponentially.<eos> And since we've shut this section down, we have no sensors in the area, so the only way to know how far it's penetrated is to do a visual inspection.<eos> All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
- No, thank you... ignorant hussy.<eos> Why, Lily Aldrin, you sly minx.<eos> I've been saying for years that our gang need a Woo Girl, and here you've been hiding a whole batch of them from me.<eos> We do not need a Woo Girl.<eos> No one needs a Woo Girl.<eos> Be careful, Lily.<eos> The world absolutely needs Woo Girls.<eos> If there were no Woo Girls, there'd be no Girls Gone Wild, no bachelorette parties, no Las Vegas poolside bars...<eos> - Those are none of the things... - The souvenir shot glass industry would collapse.<eos> So would the body glitter industry and the stretch Hummer rental industry.
I've got enough to charge you with,hector.<eos> W-we just want to know your side of the story.<eos> How'd you two meet?<eos> Oprah and dr. Phil here.<eos> I told her this is how it was going to end,<eos> Only it was going to be me that died and her sitting here with dumb cops asking dumb questions.<eos> ******<eos> Why was she?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Sure she would.
He bought a good beard for nothing.<eos> Then that night he doesn't show,so i remembered him when your nice young lady called.<eos> Uh,no disrespect,but,uh, your maid isn't very thorough.<eos> No,she is most thorough.<eos> She cleans here tomorrow.<eos> - For monthly rentals, she-- - monthly?<eos> Yes. She comes every third day.<eos> So he's been here recently, in the last two days.<eos> The chips would imply this,yes?<eos> Yes,they--they would.
You are all packed for your conference. Care to hear my opening joke for my talk on schizophrenia?<eos> I would love to.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You are all packed for your conference. Care to hear my opening joke for my talk on schizophrenia?<eos> I would love to.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I would.
Well... little gifts are always a nice way to express your feelings.<eos> I know.<eos> Could be as simple as a cashmere robe... or, uh, as extravagant as a new car.<eos> - Yeah, I suppose it could. Ahem. - Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, I got something really cool for Jake.<eos> Doesn't even have to be new.<eos> Certified pre-owned is still very thoughtful.<eos> - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> - I was trying to research cars... but you wouldn't believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."<eos> Actually, I would.
Don't you find her impressive, Mr. Shore?<eos> Denny, if this case comes down to his testimony... he's incredibly unlikable.<eos> All worked out then, didn't it?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Alan, you didn't really want to like this guy, did you?<eos> No, but I do want to win the case.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course really.<eos> What, do you think I'd purposely lose so I could be with his wife?<eos> I would.
But it turned out to be a night full of surprises...<eos> The kind most people don't care for.<eos> Damn it, Lynette.<eos> Why do you have to be such a buzz kill?<eos> Why can't you, just once, give me a little support?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll get you a towel.<eos> For what?<eos> If I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
- You know what's gonna tear me apart? Another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.<eos> Honey, look at it this way,<eos> God blessed us again because you are such a great mom.<eos> Oh. Get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch.<eos> I told you I love you.<eos> Doesn't that mean anything to you?<eos> That we had an agreement to keep things casual. Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> So if we're not in a relationship, If I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
You said you never felt this way about anyone before.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Okay, listen, after all we've been through... When you walked away tonight, all I could think was,<eos> "she's the one I want to be with."<eos> So, yeah, it matters.<eos> It's easy for you to say because you didn't just pull a Janet Jackson at the snowflake ball.<eos> Oh.<eos> You wanna grab a drink?<eos> Yes, I would.
Temporal and frontoparietal regions, normal.<eos> Occipital lobe, normal.<eos> I have the right to walk away from you, House.<eos> There is a world beyond you, you need to realize that. And even if you don't, I'm moving on.<eos> The next time you knock, I'm not answering.<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You charge me for listening in on my own conversations?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I?
Chicken dinner.<eos> - What the hell does that mean?<eos> - I don't know. I want to play.<eos> Let's not jinx my system.<eos> - What gives?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, this is just for fun, right?<eos> If you don't win I can just get you a satellite radio.<eos> I don't want the radio.<eos> I would.
This place is still packed every night.<eos> So how did philly fall so behind?<eos> He's a degenerate gambler.<eos> So why would I want to invest with him?<eos> He's in the program now.<eos> 30 gs and he's back on his feet.<eos> - He won't make the same mistake again.<eos> - Ronnie, forget it.<eos> Like my last investment with you, I'll never see my money again.<eos> - Maybe you wouldn't. - Right.
I'll practise my thank-you speech.<eos> Come on, Sasha, don't be a...<eos> What is the problem with George?<eos> (SIGHS) It's complicated.<eos> Over my head you mean.<eos> Well, George wants to pull out of the film.<eos> And I want to persuade him not.<eos> But I also want to find out why he's suddenly doing this.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want to be on TV.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
Now, you'll have to show yourself out.<eos> As I said... we lost our...our butler.<eos> Thank you for keeping my arrival a surprise, Maggie.<eos> Oh, Clara, I'm just so glad to see you again after all this time.<eos> And it was worth it to see the look on Gus's face.<eos> It's been real hard for Gus since Nellie died.<eos> I'm sure it has.<eos> I'm sure, too, that Woodrow Call wouldn't know how to be a help under those circumstances.<eos> No.<eos> He wouldn't.
A young mother in Liverpool has killed her baby in the microwave.<eos> This is our competition Eliott Gast.<eos> We have to do something so audacious that people will notice it.<eos> Small acts simply splash on the surface like a stone thrown into a pond.<eos> You, on the other hand, continue to set new records.<eos> Millions have watched, more every day.<eos> You really enjoy this...<eos> I'm simply doing my part.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Of course you would.
When Walter was here, I used to walk by his room... when he was sleeping.<eos> And even though I couldn't see him or hear him. I could feel him.<eos> That's why I don't think Walter's dead.<eos> I can still feel him.<eos> Mrs. Collins...<eos> - No. I know what the police said.<eos> But that place and the remains, they couldn't be properly identified.<eos> And maybe that kid made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture.<eos> I understand you don't want to accept this.<eos> What mother would?
- Yeah.<eos> You don't want to do it doggy style?<eos> Put it in your post - nup.<eos> He's mean to your mother?<eos> A new camaro.<eos> I can really do that?<eos> Honey,it's all part of the negotiation,you know?<eos> And let me be the first to tell you- -<eos> Well,I guess I could think about it.<eos> I would.
- You know where I'm goin'?<eos> Watch this.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's cookin'?<eos> This.<eos> Hey, franco.<eos> It's alicia.<eos> Look, I just wanted to let you know that keela and I are back in town, so of course she'd really like to see you.<eos> We both would.
What the hell is going on!<eos> We hunt Neuros.<eos> A dozen deaths traced directly to Vonotek.<eos> He's on the express elevator.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir.<eos> Pre-sales figures.<eos> We have orders from 90 percent of targeted stores throughout the country... including every major chain.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Looks like retailers are betting that Vonotek's new product... will be every bit as successful as our pharmaceuticals.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
And at this point, you'd probably settle for any guy, wouldn't you? - That is not true.<eos> - Mom, Patrick is annoying, and he's arrogant, and even if I was straight, I wouldn't go out with him.<eos> But guess what? I'm not straight.<eos> - Ok, is this about Carmen? - Car... No, mom, this is about me.<eos> Ok, alright, you don't like Patrick, I get it.<eos> All I'm trying to say to you is that maybe you shouldn't write off all guys, - maybe just because you decided that... - Decided?<eos> Decided, what? What, you think I just woke up one morning and thought to myself, how am I really gonna piss off my mom today?<eos> - Oh wait, I think I'll decide to be gay.<eos> - No!<eos> - I would never...
No, I suppose...<eos> I suppose I'm not.<eos> Come on, behave yourselves.<eos> There's still a chance to save this thing.<eos> Oh... why...<eos> Sorry, I couldn't hear you.<eos> I said, "Do you think you'd die if you drank wee?"<eos> I don't know, but it's a bloody good question.<eos> Here's a question - who here would eat a spider?<eos> I would.
What is this?<eos> Trust me, I was just standing there to meet a friend.<eos> Why else would I be standing there?<eos> And honestly,<eos> We're probably the only couple that's gone out for three years and not done it.<eos> It just that...<eos> Guys get really stressed out if they don't do it.<eos> You really want to have some fun?<eos> I would like that.<eos> I would.
- Is it, really?<eos> - Yeah. Oh, I'm so disappointed.<eos> What character did you relate to the most?<eos> I didn't relate to any of the characters.<eos> The one character that I might've related with is probably Meg.<eos> Do you think Jesus, if he would've come back, would enjoy Family Guy?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> No. No.<eos> If he would've had the network, would he cancel Family Guy?<eos> Yes, he would. Correct.
You can get the escape when you do get high, but never like the first few times.<eos> I wanna escape.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanna know what it feels like to escape.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> And I would chase that feeling all day.<eos> I would chase it until I couldn't chase it anymore.<eos> - No, you wouldn't. - Yes, I would chase it.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Then what?<eos> Maybe it was family business.<eos> Do you know something you haven't told me?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about that.<eos> I didn't think you'd understand.<eos> Me?<eos> Come on, Zane.<eos> I wouldn't?
Only you would understand.<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> - Oh, no need to.<eos> It was his time to go.<eos> No, I mean about being late.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry about that too, I just... I mean, about him.<eos> It's all gassed up, Dad. It's ready to go.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> You sure you want this?<eos> He would.
After seven years of searching,<eos> Aonghas reached the Cuilfhionn Mountains on Skye.<eos> But when he reached the peak, beyond it lay yet another peak.<eos> Nothing could have lived there.<eos> It was just a bare, grey space.<eos> It's what we call now the Inaccessible Pinnacle.<eos> And there, concealed in the snow, was the world's last crimson snowdrop.<eos> He tested the first petal on himself... the petal that didn't reach her lips in time.<eos> He wanted nothing more than for his own heart to stop beating too.<eos> But it would not.
Walk the field. Oh, walk the field.<eos> He's going back.<eos> This isn't going to work. If I had a minefield that he could sweep, then I...<eos> I could keep him busy, but I don't have a minefield.<eos> He's ours.<eos> We got a lease on him...<eos> no option to buy, and I'm taking him back.<eos> If you do, I'll leave you.<eos> You'd leave me for that weapon detector?<eos> You'd...
It's just not always the right time.<eos> It's not appropriate for us to talk.<eos> No.<eos> McPherson, what have you got? Huh?<eos> - Connie Chris?<eos> Anything?<eos> - Um... Not yet, no.<eos> - Nothing from the dealer?<eos> - Wouldn't admit to knowing her.<eos> Of course she wouldn't.
Then it's all good?<eos> On first look, no offense, but your brain...<eos> Nothing special.<eos> Do you have a family history with this sort of thing?<eos> I don't know. I'm gonna go and see my sister later, so... I can ask her.<eos> Brett, what are you doing here?<eos> Where were you?<eos> At the emergency room. James had an asthma attack.<eos> - I didn't know he had asthma.<eos> - No, you wouldn't, would you?
Come here.<eos> Before, when we used to have sex...<eos> Yeah?<eos> I wouldn't always come.<eos> Really?<eos> - Always?<eos> - No.<eos> No, sometimes.<eos> Not always, but...<eos> Sometimes you would...
Not really much of a car salesman, am I?<eos> Yeah, but you're a really good soldier.<eos> Sometimes that doesn't mean much.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes it does.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I told you, it was him or me.<eos> I wasn't kidding.<eos> Tyra, did you really think that I would choose a man over my daughter?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
I know that my best shot is in the light, not with machines or tubes or a hospital bed.<eos> You have insider information.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> So do you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's just, you know... if it came to you, it wouldn't be easy for me, that's all.<eos> Yeah, but you'd do it because you love me.<eos> And you know I'd be ok.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Well, I guess it's best that neither of us remembers.<eos> I mean, I can't even really picture the two of us.<eos> You don't think... that we...?<eos> Think that we what?<eos> You know?<eos> That we...<eos> No, Lois.<eos> I think I'd remember.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, you would.
I want you to crush him.<eos> Mr. Jordan, Keith called on your cell.<eos> He said they were at the thing, and Little Zay just ended up running.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> Well, he wanted Dwayne Jr.'s number, so I gave it to him.<eos> You did what?<eos> Damn it, "K," now I have to hear from Tanisha's mama how they both met at the Twins.<eos> You have to handle this stuff better.<eos> Mr. Jordan, I don't know any of these people.<eos> But Grizz would...
- Can't this wait? - Market's already open in Tokyo.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna open some more wine.<eos> Mr. Young wants to make sure you understand that last part.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> So when we think of Jane, let us remember her kind heart and her loving spirit.<eos> And now, if there's someone who'd like to share a special memory of our dear friend...<eos> I would.
Um,she said that she never told him she was pregnant.<eos> Oh.<eos> I think that your husband knew.<eos> He gave me a doll once.<eos> He was,you know,around.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I-- no,it's okay.<eos> I'd still like to know... who my father was.<eos> Of course you would.
It's... one of the reasons that I'm a winner.<eos> I'm in a hurry.<eos> I promised one of my patients that I would be at his first first day of drug counseling.<eos> See?<eos> I got it right here.<eos> Oh!<eos> Bar-boo!<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Why, on God's name do you think I'd care about anything that you wrote down?<eos> You wouldn't.
And if they won't give me my job back and they won't give you my pension...<eos> Gail, honey, you're gonna need money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... that... that's all I can do.<eos> I... That's as far as I can go.<eos> I don't have... access to that part of the system.<eos> To the root directory?<eos> You don't have access to the root directory?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Who would?
I do. Heck, I'm still mad at myself.<eos> It's just that, at some point, you are gonna forgive me eventually, right?<eos> It's just sometimes it feels really overwhelming.<eos> I know, but you got to let me back in.<eos> I want to. I do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're thinking about making a dollhouse for Martha?<eos> She'd really like that, wouldn't she?<eos> She would.
How can we send them back as slaves?<eos> !<eos> Hey, guys, is it true?<eos> Is Prince Jumong really in charge of sending the migrants back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Jeez...<eos> What the...?<eos> There must be a misunderstanding.<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> He wouldn't.
My work has been called ugly, and vulgar, inconsistent, naive.<eos> And in the face of this I've continued to paint, and tried to make my voice heard.<eos> You know I need all the help I can get or I may not survive this.<eos> You know that, Dorante.<eos> I have supported you, in the face of outrage.<eos> I've supported you to the public and to the Marques.<eos> I have never written anything nENative about your work.<eos> There's no need to take offence.<eos> Will you apologise?<eos> Of course he wouldn't.
Or we could just hang up the phone right now.<eos> - lf that's what you'd like.<eos> - l would, yes.<eos> Then let's do that.<eos> Hi, darling, how are you?<eos> Dad, did you forget my birthday?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Did you think I would?<eos> - l didn't know.<eos> - l never would.
- What?<eos> - What do you fucking reckon?<eos> I just had a quick little bit!<eos> It was nothing!<eos> Where?<eos> Um, In the park. When I met Ange.<eos> Did Angela do it with you? No, of course not! We left as soon as we did the deal!<eos> Only because he's decent enough to go home to his girlfriend.Like you should be!<eos> Oh candy! He sold me the dope! Why would he want to have a hit in the public toilet?<eos> Well why the fuck would you?
I'm sorry. I kind of got hooked in something.<eos> Hooked in something... Someone?<eos> No.<eos> No, not someone.<eos> I just- - I'm having a time getting used to the move and everything.<eos> - I won't take it personally.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Blow me off again, I will.<eos> Should I take that under advisement?<eos> - Yes. I would.
Yeah, not bad on short notice.<eos> It's beautiful!<eos> What'd I tell you?<eos> If you'd just let me be your king and lead you, all right?<eos> Any more?<eos> Oh, one more piece.<eos> Oh!<eos> - Would anyone mind if I...?<eos> It's mine!<eos> I would!
I know what you're thinking about.<eos> Drop it, it's useless.<eos> It's all an illusion.<eos> You remember the song?<eos> 'It's only an illusion'...<eos> What difference does it make whether he's a maniac or not?<eos> One thing's clear - he's not such a bad guy.<eos> Imagine, if a few days ago someone told you that all these things would happen to you, would you believe them?<eos> Of course you wouldn't.<eos> No-one would.
It's always good to see the man with the mysterious beard.<eos> Don't tell me you really came thirty blocks for saffron?<eos> Uh, we came here to eat.<eos> This is my friend Nina.<eos> Oh, just taking the day off, then.<eos> Nice dress.<eos> Let me guess, it was Manny's idea.<eos> It must have cost him a fortune.<eos> NINAHe made us pay for them.<eos> Well, I would, too.
Make them understand.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Then I'll listen, maybe even act.<eos> But if you renege, I'll insist the Admiral hunt you and your friends down without mercy.<eos> You seem very content.<eos> Sharon's child is safe.<eos> Adama and Roslin have agreed that more study is required before any drastic measures are taken.<eos> Yes, but by saving Roslin, you've denied yourself your rightful place of leadership.<eos> There are many aspects of you, Gaius, I will never understand.<eos> You wouldn't.
He's looking out for his newest girl.<eos> And I'm the fool who actually fears god.<eos> What's that mean, his newest girl?<eos> You think that he took care of young, pretty girls just for heaven points?<eos> No. He's getting something back, and it wasn't nothing holy.<eos> Ana wouldn't do that.<eos> She put 70 lumps of heroin in her gut.<eos> She wouldn't do something naughty for a night of safety?<eos> Come on, Alvaro.<eos> Sure she would.
It's our list. Seeing how this place could have turned me around I figure you're responsible for everything bad I did, since the summer of 1982, and that's about 200 things.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Stupid Carson Daly!<eos> Wakey, wakey! Hands off snakey!<eos> - Time to get up and get started on your list.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I chose the first one.<eos> "Took donuts from a banker, when I was not a customer."<eos> - I have to go now.? - Randy, people don't want their donuts in the afternoon.<eos> - Oh sure they would.
Hey, how about this for a change?<eos> How about in a cage match:<eos> Encyclopedia Brown versus The Great Brain... to the death.<eos> Are you high?<eos> Am I high?<eos> No!<eos> No, come on, man.<eos> I love when you go for the comedy.<eos> But I would not quit your day job beating up, uh, people.<eos> I wouldn't.
iana's a big girl, clark. she can make her own decisions.<eos> i'm not saying she can't, but we all know lex.<eos> he twists everything around, one lie on top of another, until you don't know what to believe.<eos> lex is a snake. believe me, i've seen his scales.<eos> but he did almost die taking a bullet for lana.<eos> i saved her from a bomb.<eos> doesn't that mean anything ? yeah. you know what ? it would if she knew about it.<eos> clark, the only reason lana started talking to lex was to learn more about that spaceship.<eos> if i would have been honest, she never would have had to.<eos> no, she wouldn't.
- A little bit more. Someone with Unit experience makes mid six figures in the private sector.<eos> Well.<eos> - Good for you and Andrew. - That's why we're starting our own company.<eos> We've got contracts in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.<eos> And we're looking for men to fill them.<eos> Unit men. Pays $300,000 a year to start, and two months vacation time.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They can all opt out of the Unit tomorrow if they want- well, except for Bob- and come work with us.<eos> Mack wouldn't know what to do with a hundred-dollar bill if you gave him a slide show on it.<eos> But we would, wouldn't we?
Jack and Sydney are in Vancouver, Queen's bank.<eos> They need extraction.<eos> Okay, uh, is this who I think it is?<eos> Tell the team they'll need diapers.<eos> I just spoke to Dixon.<eos> He's in contact with Europol and the SVR.<eos> So far, nothing.<eos> We'll find her, Sydney.<eos> Would you like to hold your granddaughter?<eos> Yes, I would.
Wait.<eos> - Christy...<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> Wait...<eos> I love you.<eos> Leo, what am I supposed to do?<eos> I can't let these kids risk their lives, but I'm running out of options.<eos> And if I do let them do this, how am I supposed to know if it's gonna work anyway?<eos> Let them try.<eos> Daddy would.
Don't care.<eos> Look, infection can start with a simple sneeze.<eos> And then a handshake.<eos> Perhaps an accidental collision.<eos> Then a simple touch on the shoulder.<eos> And just like that, you have a patient in trouble.<eos> Chinatown is awesome!<eos> I want that bird gone.<eos> Keith, I realize you'd like to be at your grandmother's funeral on Saturday.<eos> Heck, we all would.
This badge is on a journey, too, just like that bacon.<eos> And I got to help it find its way to where it needs to go.<eos> The badge had entered our lives a few years ago, as we were enjoying America's favorite pastime.<eos> and after we bowled, we enjoyed our favorite pastime-- stealing.<eos> We had discovered that, when people bowl, they stash their wallets and other cool stuff in their street shoes.<eos> The only valuables you should ever keep in your shoes are your feet.<eos> What kind of kid puts acorns in his shoes?<eos> A squirrel kid might.<eos> Except a squirrel kid doesn't wear shoes.<eos> Unless... no,even then it wouldn't.
Or committed triple homicide.<eos> Jethro.<eos> The three bodies found with First Sergeant Downing were<eos> Were killed with his personal weapon.<eos> I heard.<eos> Where are your glasses?<eos> Oh, I forgot 'em.<eos> I don't like what it says, either.<eos> First sergeants don't go looking for this kind of payback.<eos> You would.
( belch ) hello, i'm nanny stella !<eos> oh thank you so much for coming. please come in !<eos> and you must be eric !<eos> mom, i want a twinkie.<eos> oh, alright, dear.<eos> hold on, mrs. cartman- there are going to be some rule changes around here, eric.<eos> first of all, no video games until chores are done.<eos> i'm serious.<eos> let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.<eos> ( in british accent ) no thanks, i'd rather not !
That's absurd. Or you know, maybe it is man-made.<eos> Maybe it was man-made.<eos> Sent over to destroy your oranges and ruin you as a million dollar citrus supplier.<eos> Billion dollar.<eos> Billion dollar citrus supplier.<eos> In that case, should Castro be avenged?<eos> I didn't say Castro was behind this.<eos> I think you did. But to your point: if he is behind this?<eos> Sure. Drop all the bombs on him you want if it'll make you feel better.<eos> It would.
Um,by serious, uh,you mean,we could,like,get fired?<eos> He means,Mr. Palmer, instead of attending medical school next month, you'll most likely be in prison.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Danger,intrigue,a damsel in distress.<eos> I'm actually looking forward to it.<eos> Me,too.<eos> I'm not exactly the type that would do well in prison,guys.<eos> No one's going to think any less of you if you want out,Palmer.<eos> Really?<eos> Well,no,they probably would.
Well, there's no such thing as a perfect dragnet.<eos> The roadblock went up around the time that she switched cars.<eos> Right around here.<eos> Well, there's something called the trawler problem, where a fast boat chases a slower boat until the slower boat disappears into a fog bank.<eos> Let me guess, we're the faster boat.<eos> Right, and-and this... is the fog bank.<eos> The boundaries of the dragnet.<eos> The solution to the problem is for the faster boat to assume that the slower boat has turned around and is heading back toward it.<eos> - Why the hell would she do that?<eos> - She wouldn't.
two weeks ago, yes?<eos> yes.<eos> and when michelle planned that procedure, would the physician have to have been screened by agent hecht here?<eos> well, yeah, but we didn't always... this wasn't the kind of thing that michelle wanted to discuss with anyone but me.<eos> as i told this young fella here, tim didn't come to flagstaff until the night before we drove to l. a.<eos> but agent hecht was in flagstaff two weeks ago.<eos> and though he might not have seen you, he did see michelle.<eos> in fact, i'm pretty sure he went with her to the doctor.<eos> no.<eos> he wouldn't.
Absolutely. If he's cheating, he could bring home a disease.<eos> Okay, that's what I was thinking.<eos> I mean, that's how Bunny Connors got chlamydia.<eos> She told me she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.<eos> No, that's how she got crabs.<eos> Poor Bunny.<eos> It's always something.<eos> If it's not the clap, it's a botched face-lift.<eos> Be that as it may, do we all agree that I should tell this man's wife?<eos> I wouldn't.
Or someone slipped him the sedative so he wouldn't struggle once injected with something.<eos> - Like?<eos> - Diabetic insulin.<eos> It can cause cardiac arrest.<eos> We've seen it before. It's nearly impossible to detect unless you find a point of injection.<eos> - But if I had a chance to examine the body...<eos> - Jesus Christ! He's not even your family.<eos> Mom and Dad were.<eos> - Will you start questioning me now?<eos> - You? Why would I...
I didn't hurt that white girl.<eos> I said...tell me it's not gonna match yours.<eos> You made me a fool.<eos> I defended you to my boss, believed in you.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't have.<eos> what were you doing in her yard?<eos> Getting the note back for my sister.<eos> Then why not say that?<eos> No one's going to believe me.<eos> I would!
I went to check her pulse... and that's when I realized... what?<eos> What did you realize?<eos> The little girl... was alive.<eos> It was a miracle.<eos> A true miracle.<eos> Her mother used the warmth of her own body to keep her kid alive.<eos> Lane was with her mother that night.<eos> Anna died trying to save her baby.<eos> Why would her husband lie about that?<eos> y would bradlie about that?
Why? What could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?<eos> Look, there is nothing to be gained by dredging up the past.<eos> Orson, if there's something I should know.<eos> Could I speak to my son a moment?<eos> Of course.<eos> So you know, I've decided to accept your wife's kind invitation.<eos> I won't allow it.<eos> Oh, I think you will.<eos> We're going to end our quarrel right now, or I'll tell your wife what it's about.<eos> You wouldn't.
She made us so proud. I mean...<eos> To open a magazine, and see her right in there, so beautiful, so confident...<eos> Just exactly the way I wanted her to be. I...<eos> I never thought she'd go so far. Linda.<eos> Linda's the one I thought would be in the spotlight.<eos> Jim Clancy. Hi.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Eva would so love that you came.<eos> I don't think she'd even remember me.<eos> Oh, she would.
Whoever hid those weapons in there must've known we'd catch wind of it.<eos> Maybe they even leaked the information to us, maybe they wanted it to happen.<eos> Why?<eos> Because some people are afraid of peace.<eos> Afraid to stop fighting, afraid of what they might be without it.<eos> But you're not one of those people, are you, James?<eos> You'd like to put all this bloodshed behind you.<eos> Get a place of your own one day, a farm, maybe.<eos> A wife, kids, a life.<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
- On behalf of? - The FBI.<eos> - I thought you were FBI?<eos> - I am, Your Honour. I told you.<eos> A big, noisy mess. All right.<eos> Let's hear your argument.<eos> It's a precipitant exhumation in an inflammatory case.<eos> The evidence has not been authenticated.<eos> It has, by the Jeffersonian Institution.<eos> The FBI would like to do their own in-house analysis.<eos> Of course they would.
Come and do your demonstration.<eos> Comrades, this is Alexi Mikhailovich Isayev.<eos> He designs the retro rockets, which bring you back.<eos> This is the Earth, this, the capsule.<eos> First, we must slow the speed of the capsule, which will be travelling at around twenty-seven thousand kilometres per hour, with small, breaking rockets.<eos> The rockets must fire with great accuracy.<eos> Too long, and the capsule will fall down too rapidly towards the Earth and burn up.<eos> Too short, and it will hit the outer atmosphere and bounce off into, into a higher orbit.<eos> - How would you return?<eos> - You would not.
A shitload.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With your talent and my money I can make you a star.<eos> Hey, Jay.<eos> I saw you in the magazine.<eos> That was bitchen.<eos> Jesus Christ, girl.<eos> Ain't you Chino's old lady?<eos> No. lt's like he won't leave me alone.<eos> Well, I wouldn't either.
I've never met anyone like Stanley Kubrick.<eos> It's flat 8.<eos> Right. Flat 8.<eos> Gentlemen, over here!<eos> Here I am! Over here<eos> You simply must forgive me! You simply must!<eos> I've been talking over old creative differences with Marlon!<eos> The trouble with Marlon is he thinks he's Brando.<eos> He would not let me go!<eos> Simply wouldn't!
Or raise your hands.<eos> Woman in the back.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Instead of once a year, have you considered a monthly forum where... students and teachers could exchange thoughts in an effort to enhance... communication and bridge gaps?<eos> That's a...<eos> That's a great comment, Mrs...<eos> Miss Hamilton.<eos> I also wondered if you'd thought of monthly mixers for single parents.<eos> Not that I don't want to meet married parents as well.<eos> I would.
Please tell me.<eos> It was, uh, right before we got married.<eos> No.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> It didn't mean anything.<eos> It took a while... but eventually we got over it.<eos> My God, that is horrible!<eos> I can't believe you would do something like that.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Mom would never.
I wanna take care of myself.<eos> Take care of my kids.<eos> You know it's happening to all of us.<eos> Every woman up there.<eos> But you don't give a shit, do you?<eos> If somebody like her came to see me back in New York with this dogshit case you know what I'd do?<eos> I'd take it.<eos> Settle quick, pocket the contingency make more money than her, never see a courtroom.<eos> Pearson would never settle.<eos> - Sure he would.
You know this because you lived this before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, everything he's saying is possible.<eos> Atoms aren't really solid at all.<eos> They're loaded with space.<eos> In fact, they're mostly space.<eos> The only reason I can't put my hand through this car door... is because the door's atoms and mine are operating... on a mutually interactive frequency.<eos> But if you could somehow... change the frequency of the atoms in your hand... your hand would or could theoretically pass right through that door.<eos> Since we also see along the same frequency... visible light wave lengths, the door would also seem to disappear.<eos> Any body would.
Sergeant George is in debt, is he not, Mr Smallweed?<eos> He is indeed.<eos> Right up to his throat he is.<eos> And the debt could be called in at any moment?<eos> Quick as lightning, if my friend in the City gave the nod, Mr Tulkinghorn.<eos> And then Sergeant George, and any dependent on him, would be ruined?<eos> Would you care to reconsider, Sergeant George?<eos> Change your mind?<eos> There would be no shame in it.<eos> No, sir, I would not.
3, right?<eos> The shooting start about 8:00 last night?<eos> This is not the place of your questions.<eos> This is the place of my questions.<eos> Let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm not answering any of your questions unless you answer mine.<eos> It's a serious matter to withhold material information About a homicide, Colonel Walter.<eos> I'm not withholding any material information, madam. It's just my opinion.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Yes, i would.
Yes, I know.<eos> You have something to do with this ?<eos> Oh, I assure you, if I'd wanted Miranda Ellis dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> But she isn't dead.<eos> She's very much alive.<eos> The thing you need to ask yourself is, why would the love of your life go to such measures to convince the world she was dead ?<eos> What are you talking about ?<eos> Miranda set this whole thing up.<eos> No, she..<eos> Miranda would never...
- Guys!<eos> Be honest.<eos> You didn't want any part of this until you found out I was involved.<eos> That is so not true.<eos> Oh, yes, it is.<eos> It burns you that your own daughter picked me over you.<eos> She did not pick you.<eos> It just didn't occur to her I would agree to do it.<eos> Now she knows, and if she had it to do over again, she'd pick me.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
She's the one that got away.<eos> But wherever she is--<eos> Someone's coming!<eos> We'll be safe in here.<eos> No one uses it.<eos> You worked out what you're going to say yet?<eos> I'll think of something.<eos> Tell him you're a useless jerk.<eos> He'll believe you.<eos> I would.
Why make a second appointment? She didn't.<eos> The nurse made the appointment.<eos> They were looking-- They were looking for ovarian cancer.<eos> You got all of that from one canceled appointment?<eos> With Jerry Lauseng, yeah.<eos> He's an oncologist.<eos> Hang on. Her current blood work doesn't show cancer.<eos> C.A. 125 is normal.<eos> And the cancer wouldn't account for the alleged twitch or any of her other alleged symptoms.<eos> Actually, it would.
What if that kid talks, huh?<eos> Did you ever think of that?<eos> Huh?<eos> What if he goes to The Star and he says that Rod Sebring is an ass bandit?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Ben wouldn't do that.<eos> Ben wouldn't do that.<eos> No.<eos> He wouldn't.
- No, I'll just have yours.<eos> - Did I miss anything?<eos> - No, it's boring.<eos> Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is returning from Parliament, which was opened today by Her Majesty the Queen.<eos> Though for an extra 40 quid, they could have had Kerry McFadden.<eos> Prime Minister. Here's a summary of the Arab-lsraeli conflict.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you have a copy of the draft treaty there?<eos> In the Foreign Secretary's office. I'll get it.<eos> Would you?
Hal, get in this bed and go to sleep!<eos> Oh, I'll sleep, Lois. I'll sleep where I'm wanted!<eos> Are you coming back to bed, or should I just order a crib for you?<eos> I'm not coming back.<eos> I don't like to be where I'm not wanted.<eos> Especially if it's on a big giant bed!<eos> You've been on the couch for four days.<eos> I can hold on as long as you can.<eos> I have nothing to apologize for!<eos> Why would you?
He won't kill Ducky.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you couldn't live with the guilt?<eos> Maybe Ari knows that.<eos> Maybe that's his plan.<eos> Maybe the only way to save Ducky, Abby and McGee is to kill yourself.<eos> Special Agent McGee.<eos> Found Ducky and Gerald's cell phone in the park.<eos> Why would they leave their cell phones in the park?<eos> They wouldn't, McGee!
