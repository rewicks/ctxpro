This better be good.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Good enough?<eos> Yeah, what happened?<eos> What happened is I need by bank to cover some debts.<eos> Wait, you're his bank?<eos> It's not a charity.<eos> She makes money.<eos> - I don't make money.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I need my bank to cover some debts.<eos> You're his bank?<eos> Here, don't say your bank didn't do anything for you.<eos> What am I supposed to do with it?<eos> Sell it, pawn it.<eos> Are you sure you wanna do this?<eos> It's your first time, I want it to be perfect. - I miss her.<eos> - I'll find her for you.<eos> I believe you have a necklace of mine.<eos> - No, I don't.
Lourdes is trying to gain power by controlling you.<eos> I answer to a higher power.<eos> Lexi... I think you're in danger, and I'm not convinced that the people here have your back.<eos> There's not even anyone guarding the camp.<eos> As long as we are peaceful, the world is peaceful.<eos> Will you please stop talking like a damn fortune cookie.<eos> How would you like me to talk?<eos> Do you have a manual for how I should communicate?<eos> You think you're a better teacher than Dickens or Shakespeare or your own God? !<eos> Do you? !
There he is.<eos> It's Tom!<eos> Tom Mason? !<eos> You want me?<eos> Here I am!<eos> No!<eos> Tom!<eos> Welcome, Tom Mason.<eos> You know my name.<eos> I do.
Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.<eos> There's an argument for that.<eos> But I want to make sure.<eos> Smile. Ho, ho, ho! Okay.<eos> On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne.<eos> Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.<eos> Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.<eos> Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?<eos> Do you want the fire extinguisher?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.<eos> You feeling okay?<eos> You hardly touched your goose.<eos> It smelled too much like blue jay.<eos> Can I help you clean up?<eos> Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you're good.<eos> Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?<eos> Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.<eos> I thought you hate giving gifts.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I just want to spend it with you...if you'll have me.<eos> That sounds like --<eos> It is.<eos> My God.<eos> I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.<eos> But will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do we know we're doing the right thing?<eos> We don't.
That sounds like --<eos> It is.<eos> My God.<eos> I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.<eos> But will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do we know we're doing the right thing?<eos> We don't.<eos> We don't.
A transporter.<eos> Great.<eos> What's a transporter?<eos> Run now, talk later, okay ?<eos> Thank you for saving my life.<eos> Not yet, I haven't.<eos> Your roommates miss you.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Absolutely I have a plan.<eos> You don't...
- _ - _<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What's it look like?<eos> Tell him to run.<eos> Tell him.<eos> He says,<eos> "Run. You're about to die."<eos> Tell him that this bridge can tolerate a static load of two tons, or 24 kilograms per meter square.<eos> I don't think he's interested.<eos> Just do it.
Ah. Cheers to us being divorcés.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I got my h-o-t!<eos> I've got my d-o-g!<eos> I love that streety meat.<eos> So drop that meaty beat.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why do you always got to...<eos> the "hey" has never worked.<eos> Yeah, it does, as a punctuation.
They've had an atomic program since Hitler was in art school.<eos> If we can recruit them, we'll finally have a fighting chance.<eos> They've got to give us at least one Brit for implosion.<eos> Oppenheimer barely tolerates our existence.<eos> You really think he's gonna up and hand us Nicholas Nickelby?<eos> Oppenheimer's not going to hand us anything.<eos> He's letting the Brits choose which group they join.<eos> Well, no offense, but who's going to choose this group over Thin Man?<eos> The Brits had 30 scientists working on implosion the past year.<eos> They did?
How is that good, Marco?<eos> We lied.<eos> I pretend to be the hero, everyone saves face, and your name's kept out of it.<eos> The lie protects everyone.<eos> Did you arrest Robles?<eos> It's not that easy, Sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.<eos> That should be plenty to take him down.<eos> No, they don't.
I was 13.<eos> I mean...<eos> - he was my big brother.<eos> - It would have made a difference, Jack.<eos> Lisa could still be alive.<eos> Okay, look... I want you to understand, please,<eos> - I didn't come looking for this.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You knew exactly what you were doing.<eos> So did you.
- Here.<eos> - Thanks for your help.<eos> - We'll put the bonsai here.<eos> - Can you manage ?<eos> Get these panels up.<eos> - This goes here.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - Pull your pants up !<eos> - Don't like it ?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Daddy. - Oh.<eos> Baby, I'm fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - I'll let you guys talk.<eos> - Partner.<eos> You two arrive at the same time?<eos> - Dad, we have something that we need to tell you.<eos> Dad, the thing is-- - You two are dating.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
She's not my Mom.<eos> She is the woman I have to live with until I find my real Mom.<eos> Which is hopefully before you guys find her.<eos> Well, to be honest, that's turned out to be a lot harder than we expected.<eos> Really?<eos> Besides you, all we've got is a tip line with sightings from 50 different countries.<eos> Who even knows what she looks like now.<eos> Or what her name is.<eos> Really, you have absolutely no idea?<eos> Neither does the FBI.
What've you got for me?<eos> Two fat pigs and a fine goat.<eos> Hello.<eos> That's two fat pigs and a fine goat.<eos> We'll see you tonight.<eos> You'll join me for a dram?<eos> - Aye!<eos> - Good.<eos> I thought you said no pigs.<eos> Aye, I did, didn't I?
Of course.<eos> Okay, I don't want to seem insensitive with everything that's happening with Daphne right now.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We're not gonna ignore you. What's going on?<eos> Emmett's going to USC in the fall, and I want to go with him.<eos> And I asked my parents and my dad was really against it.<eos> I can see why he's concerned.<eos> L.A. is a long way away.<eos> That's what he said, but he also said that if I put together a good plan, they'd be okay with me going.<eos> And did you?
Why?<eos> Clean slate in the eyes of the church, I guess.<eos> Nikki's pretty religious.<eos> This doesn't mean that she's forgotten about you or that it didn't mean anything<eos> - or even that she isn't still hurting.<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been saying the same things to myself for the last two hours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have your music and your family and a million friends.<eos> I do.

~ Grant is definitely a person of interest.<eos> Let's check out his lifestyle.<eos> Does he use the personal ads on Clicker?<eos> Interview his supervisors and colleagues.<eos> Find out how he gets to and from work.<eos> Do a CCTV trawl around the hospital.<eos> If he has sneaked in and out let's get some evidence.<eos> I thought I was so grown up the first time I slept with a stranger.<eos> I mean, I know some women regret casual sex.<eos> I just don't but...
Who says- - Rebecca?<eos> I mean, come on, aren't you banking a lot on this journal?<eos> Isn't that the same journal that said she killed her Vincent?<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know what happened or why.<eos> It doesn't make sense, but I'm not doing this because of the journal, I'm doing this because what does make sense is protecting Vincent from Gabe.<eos> And that's all that matters to me.<eos> I got to stop Gabe now.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Uh, Toby... tell me you have the Lynwood payment.<eos> First, can I note how I nearly tripled the Lynwood payment?<eos> So those thugs are chasing you down to give you a big congratulations?<eos> I beat them in poker!<eos> They're born chumps!<eos> Pupils that dilate like saucers whenever they had a good hand. Come on!<eos> A Harvard-trained behaviorist should know that people<eos> - don't like to get cheated!<eos> - I hate you.<eos> - No, you don't.
I know.<eos> But I want to stay... and help.<eos> Is that wrong?<eos> No.<eos> It's just...very human.<eos> It's a compliment.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sam.<eos> You need to get to Beulah, North Dakota ... now.<eos> I do? Yes.
I don't know.<eos> That is a vast understatement.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, Cass, listen.<eos> I know you're not feeling so hot, but this is kind of an "all hands on deck" situation here, so...<eos> So... I'll meet you there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> If you wanted to stay behind...<eos> I didn't.
Maybe I was just...<eos> tired of babysitting you or always having to yank your lame ass out of the fire since forever.<eos> Or maybe -- maybe it was the fact that my mother would still be alive if it wasn't for you.<eos> That your very existence sucked the life out of my life.<eos> This isn't my brother talking.<eos> You never had a brother -- just an excuse for not manning up.<eos> But guess what.<eos> I quit.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
- Yes, I did, but I...<eos> - But what?<eos> Her boyfriend's kool-aid.<eos> - Maybe if more people did,<eos> There just might be...<eos> - God damn it, rachel, I'm not in business to save the world.<eos> I asked for a professional opinion.<eos> - And I gave you a professional opinion.<eos> You just don't like it.<eos> - No, I don't.
You once told me that my actions had consequences.<eos> Remember?<eos> Your actions yesterday have consequences too.<eos> - What did you say to gianopolous?<eos> - Not much.<eos> Just that you were the person responsible For his number two leaving him.<eos> - I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it.<eos> - But what he didn't know was is that It was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> - And what does that...
- Never gonna happen.<eos> He's got a golden parachute.<eos> - Well, then I've got two people on the board.<eos> I can force a vote.<eos> - You do that, it triggers a stock split.<eos> His shares double in voting power.<eos> Yours don't.<eos> - I mean, that's all five.<eos> None of them work.<eos> - No, they don't.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I made a stupid mistake coming here.<eos> You had a warrant from Europol.<eos> Worthless in a country like this, I knew that.<eos> Obviously you didn't.
Could we get back to work, do you think?<eos> What are you exactly?<eos> You don't smell like police but that's some pretty cool gear you got there.<eos> You like a spy, or something?<eos> Oh, he's a bright one, hang on to him!<eos> He was the last one to go missing.<eos> And when he disappeared all the doors and windows were locked from the inside.<eos> 'Ooh, now you're talking.<eos> I love a good locked room mystery.'<eos> Yeah, doesn't everyone?
Oh, like you listened to her?<eos> He's right.<eos> She was trying to tell me something and I ignored her.<eos> Maebh Arden is tuned to a different channel.<eos> She can lead us to the source, to the heart of the forest.<eos> We have to listen to her, we have to find her.<eos> Not everything can be fixed with a screwdriver.<eos> It's not a magic wand.<eos> ~ Does she have a phone?<eos> ~ Well, yes, she does.
Well...<eos> No, not now.<eos> Go home.<eos> Do your marking.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> I saved you from a tiger today.<eos> I deserve at least that.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And yes, you do.
This is who the Doctor is.<eos> Watch the blood-soaked old general in action.<eos> I can't see properly, sir, because this needs activating.<eos> If you want to know what's coming, you have to switch... it... on.<eos> And didn't all of those beautiful speeches just disappear in the face of a tactical advantage?<eos> Sir?<eos> I need to know.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.<eos> All of this...<eos> All of it, just to give me an army?<eos> Well, I don't need one, do I?<eos> Armies are for people who think they're right.<eos> And nobody thinks they're righter than you!<eos> Give a good man firepower, and he'll never run out of people to kill.<eos> I don't want an army.<eos> Well, that's the trouble!<eos> Yes, you do!
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Oh, good old PE.<eos> He'll make a maths teacher yet.<eos> Listen, Doctor.<eos> There's something that I have to tell you and, um... ..it's not good news so just listen, OK?<eos> I know.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I know exactly what you've got to tell me.<eos> You do?
Okay...<eos> Look, uh, I can sense that you're stressed about something.<eos> - I can see it, okay?<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> I have an eye for these things right here and right here.<eos> Sam gave me a key to his apartment this morning.<eos> Shut... up.<eos> That's like practically a marriage proposal.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> You didn't?
I ju... I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> No, what you need to do is stay still, okay?<eos> We can talk later.<eos> Uh, there might not be a later.<eos> Please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Um, I... I just wanted to... to say that...<eos> Um, I'm sorry... you know, everything I did, all the screw-ups, leaving you with that kid.<eos> I wanted to go in that house.<eos> I did.
Can't we just have a truce?<eos> You got into a great college.<eos> Life is good again.<eos> Matty and I were supposed to drive up to San Diego to meet his bio dad, but then Gabby showed up.<eos> Sweetheart, don't spend the rest of your time in high school hung up on Matty.<eos> You need to focus on yourself and your own needs.<eos> That's how I cope with your father.<eos> Okay, it's not exactly the same thing, but you know what I mean, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sadly, I do.
You can have anything you want.<eos> How did you meet Ji-wook?<eos> He just came to me by chance.<eos> That's weird!<eos> Are you two dating?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Ji-wook doesn't talk much but you two seem kinda close.<eos> I don't even know his name.<eos> He probably doesn't know mine either.<eos> He does.
You talking to your birds?<eos> Yeah. Unser's here.<eos> He needs to talk to us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, thanks for... thanks for not saying anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love him.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Yes, I do.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> What good does sorry do?<eos> Donna, I thought it was the best thing for everyone involved.<eos> You thought it was the best way to get Logan out of the picture and not deal with what happened.<eos> No, I tried to deal with what happened without telling anyone, which is what you told me to do.<eos> I did not tell you to let your personal life affect Harvey's business.<eos> I was just trying to get Mike and Harvey back on the same team.<eos> I want you to understand that the way to do that isn't to pull strings behind their backs.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> People believe what they want to believe.<eos> - Yeah, no shit.<eos> - Don't you see?<eos> This is what he wants.<eos> You know, there's a version of this where you're happy.<eos> Because it means somewhere in Scottsdale, Arizona your girl's alive.<eos> [Spanish guitar plays] [Man sings in Spanish] Perfect.<eos> Do you like [Speaking Spanish], Johnny?<eos> Nah, no, I don't, man.
Armadillo. I hate to break it to you, but... she's your girlfriend.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You're up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like we're both working late.<eos> Yeah, I caught a call on my way out the--you don't care.<eos> No, I do.
Who?<eos> Me.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Where are we?<eos> This is a tactical training facility.<eos> This is where the magic happens.<eos> I thought we'd be able to go over a few basics, just in case we were called to a crime scene.<eos> This is a battering ram.<eos> Wow, you should keep one of those in the house in case you wanna get into my room.<eos> Oh, I do.
Even babies, you know, they can only drink milk.<eos> I think they're thinking,<eos> "you know what this milk could really use?<eos> A cookie."<eos> I think you just made a joke.<eos> I am not an animal, I am a human being.<eos> I know it's... it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger gone bad.<eos> You're too young.<eos> You don't know that reference.<eos> Yeah, I do.
(Kyle) Your husband knows that you and I are having an affair.<eos> What did he say?<eos> What exactly did he say?<eos> I can't remember, he came out of left field.<eos> He asked me if I had a hot date, and I said no.<eos> And he said, "Well, it's too bad that Elizabeth is stuck here with her family."<eos> It's not like he said, "Kyle, I know you're sleeping with my wife."<eos> Trust me, Liz, he knows.<eos> Can we--<eos> And now... so do we.
Why didn't you say something?<eos> Can you please stop banging your extremely handsome partner?<eos> Did I have to tell you that?<eos> Why did you stay with me?<eos> I knew one day you'd stop.<eos> I knew he didn't mean that much to you.<eos> How?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> I know how you are when you're in love.<eos> Yes, you do.
You know what this means?<eos> We no longer have a cop in our family.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's just a leave of absence.<eos> We temporarily no longer have a cop in our family.<eos> Thanks for letting me come home.<eos> Yeah, we just got our family back together again, it seemed like a really bad idea to tear it apart.<eos> Yeah, really bad idea.<eos> I want it to work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all do.
My other mom's a felon.<eos> She's the one I take after.<eos> Well, it's official.<eos> You're the good daughter.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Mom made a plate.<eos> A cop who cooks.<eos> She really can do it all?<eos> Actually, I made that.<eos> I do most of the cooking around here.
I do.<eos> Okay, well... Let me know if you find anything.<eos> Absolutely, I'll look into this.<eos> Carter wants yogurt.<eos> Great.<eos> Go, have fun.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, yo, try some Fro-Yo.<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Um, yeah, yeah, I do.
- What do you mean?<eos> So they're stalking your phone, right?<eos> In case your mom sends you a message.<eos> So we get your mom... I mean, us pretending to be your mom to text you.<eos> With burner phones.<eos> Cheapo phones with prepaid minutes.<eos> You can get 'em pretty much anywhere.<eos> Including right here.<eos> It's a side business, I also sell glow sticks.<eos> I do very well at parties.
Are you still a Kitsune?<eos> Technically.<eos> These are your grandmother's ashes.<eos> Grandma died in Eichen House.<eos> Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.<eos> But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
I was just curious about the terminology.<eos> We're not in any kind of dire straits.<eos> I know about the bills, Dad.<eos> I know about the collectors calling about Eichen House.<eos> I know about the advance from the department, about the credit cards.<eos> Stiles, are you going through my stuff?<eos> Yeah, I go through all of your stuff.<eos> Especially when you keep things from me.<eos> I keep things from you because you don't need to know everything.<eos> Yes, I do.
But is it still just professionals?<eos> I don't think Haigh's ever tried anything like this.<eos> I think he was taking a chance.<eos> That means anyone with the dead pool could take a chance.<eos> But if Haigh had it, then who else does?<eos> How easy is it to get this thing now?<eos> Meredith was only there *** once.<eos> But I think once was enough.<eos> How did your grandmother know her?<eos> She didn't.
He put it online.<eos> He took the money from the Hale Vault, then turned the bearer bonds into cash.<eos> He made the payments.<eos> Was it Brunski's idea to fake your death?<eos> Did he get nervous because you helped us with one of the cipher keys?<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
I'm not gonna let you die.<eos> Eh, you might just have to concentrate on saving yourself.<eos> I don't hear it.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, no.<eos> There's only one way out on this side of the basement.<eos> I know.<eos> But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
I'm doing better.<eos> I'm working.<eos> I just came by to say thank you for the suit.<eos> And I think I look great in it.<eos> Yes, you look great in the suit, but you didn't show up.<eos> But I look good in the suit.<eos> I mean, look at it. Pow!<eos> You actually look like Daddy.<eos> Now you know you don't remember Dad.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Maybe.<eos> Come on, let's go home and talk about it, huh?<eos> - (sniffles) - Okay, let's go. (chuckles softly)<eos> Oh, you got gifts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Murray's a good mom.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> Sometimes I get tired of going home to an empty apartment.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
My other mom's a felon.<eos> She's the one I take after.<eos> Well, it's official.<eos> You're the good daughter.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Mom made a plate.<eos> A cop who cooks.<eos> She really can do it all?<eos> Actually, I made that.<eos> I do most of the cooking around here.

Not gonna happen.<eos> Soon as that curtain rises, we are gonna be there to take out this Calliope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing, champ?<eos> This... This is all my fault.<eos> If I hadn't written this dumb play, none of this would've happened.<eos> Okay, well, first of all, uh, the play's not dumb.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in this interpretation.<eos> I don't.
Are you in there?<eos> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most dangerous of them all?<eos> There's been a spillage in Geography, I need some paper towels.<eos> Can't you read?<eos> Course I can read.<eos> Read what?<eos> The door.<eos> It says, "Keep Out."<eos> No, it says, "Go Away Humans."<eos> Oh, so it does.
Your strategy for dealing with it involves endangering this school.<eos> ~ I don't know anything because you haven't told me anything, which means I wouldn't approve, which means you are endangering this school.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a scanner.<eos> I'm scanning.<eos> Why do I keep you around?<eos> Because the alternative would be developing a conscience of your own.<eos> Scanning for what? Any alien technology in this vicinity should show up.<eos> I used to have a teacher exactly like you once.<eos> You still do.
Where is he?<eos> Fun fact, we have no idea.<eos> Fun fact, I got a warrant for his arrest.<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - At the moment, kidnapping.<eos> I anticipate an upgrade to murder, but that's just me.<eos> We've become aware of certain emails and texts he sent to Rose Marquez.<eos> Threatening ones.<eos> If you know where he is, you should tell us.<eos> We don't.
You had Doug approach me?<eos> You planned this whole thing?<eos> You took the bait.<eos> I know you better than you do.<eos> I only wanted to be alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried and I tried.<eos> Mr. Martin... She was never the girl I needed her to be.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
You're a psychopath.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Maybe.<eos> They say a lot of CEOs are.<eos> It's good for business.<eos> It's about Frank.<eos> What about him?<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> You know where he is now?<eos> - We do.
Do not tempt me.<eos> I didn't plan on it.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, you were a little busy back there with those mechs.<eos> Weren't you?<eos> Now, here's how it's gonna roll.<eos> See, I'm gonna retake my truck and my fuel.<eos> You... if you want to try and stop me, knock yourself out, but we both know I'm gonna end up with it.<eos> I know karate.<eos> No, you don't.
I remember everything.<eos> Like the fact that I never read Paradise Lost.<eos> Hey, Pete.<eos> Those drinks aren't on the house.<eos> I can't keep covering you.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> I just... I rolled out and forgot my cards.<eos> I'll get you back.<eos> - You said that last time.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Like the fact that I never read Paradise Lost.<eos> Hey, Pete.<eos> Those drinks aren't on the house.<eos> I can't keep covering you.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> I just... I rolled out and forgot my cards.<eos> I'll get you back.<eos> - You said that last time.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Uh, yes, you did.
Fresh start.<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> You know, you never finished telling me about your little Bonnie and Clyde stint.<eos> I bet Bonnie and Clyde did not need a matchmaking service.<eos> And look how well they turned out.<eos> Do you really think people need someone like Gwen Stein to, I don't know, make the magic happen?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, look at us.<eos> We have the magic.<eos> - We do?
She came out here for a midnight swim like we all did when we were kids...<eos> Like Dr. Bryce said, an accident.<eos> Take her to the medical centre.<eos> She's been out here way too long.<eos> You really believe this wasn't an accident?<eos> Look, I know it may sound crazy...<eos> I want you to look into it.<eos> If there is the slightest chance, we need to be sure.<eos> Captain, I don't have any experience with anything like this.<eos> Nobody does.
We need to get over there.<eos> - WOMAN: 911.<eos> - Lieutenant Burns, Major Crimes, requesting a 10-13.<eos> Officer shot at 1216 163rd Street.<eos> Carrie.<eos> There was a car right here.<eos> A rental. You got the plate?<eos> Uh, I... I...<eos> I didn't... I didn't see it.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Get that bread you like, with the cheese.<eos> We could head down to the water and...<eos> Pretend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> - Let someone else be cops for a while. - Oh...<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
You will die.<eos> Yeah, so will you. Huh. We all die.<eos> That's no prediction.<eos> Sorry I asked.<eos> But as you're aware, I am convinced of your paranormal powers.<eos> I have denied them.<eos> Tell me, Bess, do you believe that Harry, here, is the possessor of supernatural powers?<eos> Over me he sure does.<eos> I believe when we first met, I told you I was a clairvoyant.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you did.
Look it up.<eos> Oh, I have.<eos> When did you first meet Zelda?<eos> Why are you asking me that?<eos> Jonny, to get the mayor's permission to do this briefing, we had to promise to eliminate you as a suspect.<eos> So before I can tell you what's up, you have to tell me what went down.<eos> It'll only take a few minutes.<eos> Now, you first met Zelda when?<eos> We were married in 1992, but she had a thing for Jon long before that.<eos> Still does.
Your mother committed suicide.<eos> No, he made her do that, all right?<eos> !<eos> She... she was fine before, okay?<eos> And my mother...<eos> I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
Liz, I wouldn't do it with any screw.<eos> Of course you wouldn't, and that's why you've gotta stick to your guns.<eos> She's gonna take my baby or worse, she'll kill it.<eos> Come on, come on, you're being ridiculous.<eos> Darling, she is just trying to intimidate you, Dor.<eos> Well, it's working!<eos> You have got to be strong.<eos> It's easy for you to say.<eos> You don't even have kids, Liz.<eos> I do.
And his child bride, Amber.<eos> Go, Stan!<eos> Babe, don't.<eos> You're breaking my concentration.<eos> And then there's Dash.<eos> That's the baby of the family.<eos> He's Bunny's great-nephew -- Harvard business.<eos> How do you guys know Aunt Bunny?<eos> We, uh -- we -- we -- we didn't personally know her.<eos> Our -- our surrogate dad, Bobby Singer, did.

I thought long that I was crazy.<eos> But I can read a suspect better than anyone else.<eos> I knew when my daughter was lying.<eos> And when my wife fell in love with someone else.<eos> When you see visions and hear voices it is easy to think you are crazy.<eos> You think you're sick, but it is not.<eos> It is not.<eos> But it has never been like this.<eos> - It is, as I have hurt anyone.<eos> - You do not.
We're not immortal.<eos> Cherish your time together.<eos> Alex...<eos> What happened?<eos> Michael's life lessons.<eos> Did you... scatter Bixby's ashes?<eos> In the garden under a jacaranda tree.<eos> In the spring, it's gonna be full of purple flowers.<eos> I thought she was gonna make it through.<eos> Yeah, we all did.
You're looking for an isotope with a large neutron capture cross section.<eos> At least 2.2 times 10 to the 6th barns.<eos> There's iodine-135.<eos> - 6% of fission by-product.<eos> - And highly unstable.<eos> It could be breaking down into something else.<eos> Xenon?<eos> 135 would have an enormous neutron absorption cross section.<eos> I've studied the xenon isotopes. 135 doesn't exist.<eos> Neither did a continuous nuclear reactor until today.
Well, you have a very nice singing voice.<eos> I look like Shirley Temple.<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> Please don't make me do this anymore.<eos> I'm afraid your mother's calling the plays on this one.<eos> It's your fault we're here in the first place.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are we looking at?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
There's one way that they will.<eos> What Way?<eos> If we're divorced.<eos> The problem is that neither Clark Kent nor Bruce Wayne has a sense of humor.<eos> I know their parents died, and that's really sad, but...<eos> Honestly, even I get tired of superhero orphans.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They should make a comic book about you.<eos> You already have an origin story, right?<eos> I do?
What?<eos> You.<eos> You're so impressed with yourself.<eos> "Look at me.<eos> Look at what I did.<eos> I'm bringing democracy to Abbudin."<eos> You really believe he can do this?<eos> Win the votes and the love of the people?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, you pull that needle, and we'll see who pricks who.<eos> Dougal, Lieutenant, enough.<eos> You're both behaving like children.<eos> Yes, yes, quite right. Quite right.<eos> The lady's sense of propriety puts us all to shame.<eos> The question of the kilt will remain an enigma.<eos> My word, madam.<eos> If I were brave enough, I would commission you a colonel in one of my regiments.<eos> You do know how to order men about.<eos> Aye, she does that.
This is my job!<eos> Don't lecture me about jobs!<eos> Enough.<eos> Korra, listen to Lin.<eos> But.... they... please.<eos> Lin's only looking out for you.<eos> I promise you Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you really think it's best.<eos> I do.
Good, the entire family is here.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.<eos> What is it you want from us?<eos> Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her.<eos> - You're using us as leverage?<eos> - Yes. I will never let you get to Korra.<eos> Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, I do.
For he commands us to love our God, as well as our neighbor.<eos> Do you love your God?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you love your neighbor?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did not love my neighbor this week.<eos> I sat in judgment on my fellow man.<eos> I reveled in the pit of my own self-righteousness.<eos> So I deserve to be cast out into darkness, and I do not deserve salvation.<eos> None of us does.
She wants us to go in there with her.<eos> Where, to therapy?<eos> Do we have to?<eos> I don't think it's such a bad idea for us.<eos> "For us"?<eos> Yeah, you've been kind of distant lately.<eos> I'm sorry, Helen.<eos> It's just... it's just this book.<eos> And you don't want to fuck me anymore.<eos> Of course I do.
This is for Rusty's sake.<eos> It is.<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Is that it?<eos> And you think you know my son?<eos> And you think you can just have me boxed up and out of the way?<eos> Lady, let me tell you something.<eos> You just made a really big mistake.<eos> - I made a mistake?<eos> - Yes, you did.
- What? Terrorism Prevention...<eos> - And if I call the police...?<eos> - Yeah... Of course.<eos> Here... use my phone.<eos> The number's 999.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do!
It was you. Oh... you left the music box.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> We used to hum that song together when you were little.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, because you're not my mother.<eos> You didn't hum anything to me.<eos> And the only reason you remember is because my father told you.<eos> I thought all the years that I spent with your father and the love that we shared would count for something.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
You have 15 minutes to solve this charade.<eos> Hey. What the hell is this?<eos> Your stop.<eos> This ain't no stop!<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Get your... get your hands off me!<eos> You're a dead man!<eos> Do you... you know who I am?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.
ABELARDO: Can you identify any of these men?<eos> EVA: Him.<eos> LINDER: H-Hold on a second here.<eos> We're-we're talking about police officers from Juárez.<eos> You gonna protect her?<eos> - Did you arrest Robles?<eos> - It's not that easy, Sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.<eos> No, they don't.
- Pecan.<eos> - I have a nut allergy.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Have mine.<eos> - It's rhubarb.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Tart.<eos> I like it.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Detective Cross does.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Yes, I'm sure.<eos> Please...<eos> I have a family.<eos> Put him in the car.<eos> I thought we were done.<eos> No, we're not done yet, Cesar. Yeah.<eos> I want to see Captain Robles.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> No, I do not.
He knows everything.<eos> I wouldn't like that, It would take all the mystery out of life.<eos> Anyway, if it came from the zoo, it would have 'Property of the zoo' stamped on it.<eos> No, it wouldn't.<eos> They don't stamp animals 'Property of the zoo.'<eos> You can't stamp a huge Siberian tiger, 'Property of the zoo.'<eos> They stamp them when they're small.<eos> What happens when they moult?<eos> Siberian tigers don't moult.<eos> No, but penguins do!
Thank you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Stupid dick!<eos> Hello. Is this the right room for an argument?<eos> I've told you once...<eos> - No, you haven't.<eos> - Yes, I have.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just now.<eos> - No, you didn't.

- Just the five minutes.<eos> - Just the five minutes.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Anyway I did.<eos> You most certainly did not.<eos> Now let's get one thing absolutely clear.<eos> I most definitely told you.<eos> - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.
[ gasps ] Korsak: Paul wescourt,<eos> [ sighs ] oh, my... [ knock on door ]<eos> Dr. Isles? My friends call me maura.<eos> Come on in, allie. Can I get you anything?<eos> Never autopsy on an empty stomach, I always say.<eos> Uh, wow.<eos> What do you mean by that? I mean...<eos> This office is great.<eos> I love tribal art... Especially ritual masks of west africa.<eos> You do?
I couldn't reveal that I was weak.<eos> Being open doesn't make you weak.<eos> It's honest.<eos> A good leader is being what you need to be, when you need to be it.<eos> Strong.<eos> Merciless.<eos> Vulnerable.<eos> I was chosen.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yeah, well, what about this one?<eos> Florida.<eos> Wasn't anywhere near domesticated.<eos> Brought him back to the surface for five minutes.<eos> Five minutes, and then he went into convulsions and died.<eos> And these are the only ones who carried I.D.s.<eos> What about Nevada?<eos> I believe I was out when you worked on her.<eos> Yeah, you don't want to know about Nevada.<eos> Yes, I do.
Let's ask him.<eos> Hey, don't hold back.<eos> Nobody's going inside.<eos> What are you... I got a fight.<eos> Anyone who doesn't belong here should go.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You killed Bobby and Abe.<eos> You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.<eos> We do.

I got a fight.<eos> Anyone who doesn't belong here should go.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You killed Bobby and Abe.<eos> You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.<eos> We do.<eos> You're wesen.<eos> Got no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, yeah, you do.
Do you like them?<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> Let me see!<eos> Diamond earrings?<eos> !<eos> I want diamond earrings.<eos> Are you sure you like them?<eos> No...<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I do, I just...
We're getting electric skateboards?<eos> It wasn't extravagant.<eos> It was a wedding gift.<eos> - OK.<eos> Just inappropriate.<eos> - Stef, come on.<eos> I mean, a bed is a very personal thing.<eos> And not only did you buy us a bed without asking us, but you got rid of the one that we love.<eos> Look, if you don't like the bed, please...<eos> We don't. We don't.
I don't always want to be looking over my shoulder.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> I trust you, Ray.<eos> Ain't no need to do that.<eos> I got people to handle that shit, you know?<eos> How's this gonna work?<eos> What you mean, Ray?<eos> How do I know for sure... you're not gonna hurt my kid?<eos> You don't.
Dyson, it wasn't anybody's fault.<eos> This isn't gonna fix anything.<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> You tried to kill the hunter, my ex shot you with a tranquilizer dart.<eos> Usual Thursday fair.<eos> I can explain.<eos> I hope so, Mark.<eos> Because that hunter had some pretty crazy things to say about you.<eos> Of course he did.
I'm sick and tired of running.<eos> Of everyone around me dying.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Killing that man is not the answer.<eos> Then what is?<eos> I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> I don't have anyone else to turn to.<eos> I don't have anything but this.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
We're dealing with a cult here.<eos> A Fae cult.<eos> Dyson, those three bodies from the elevator crash...<eos> They were taken the other night.<eos> Three ritual killings.<eos> Three missing bodies.<eos> There could be a connection.<eos> You have anything with the missing bodies with the scent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And you endangered her and her daughter for what, for a lousy payday!<eos> Not a payday.<eos> It's my ticket out.<eos> Of what?<eos> A.R.G.U.S.!<eos> You don't know the things Waller's made me do.<eos> The person she turns you into.<eos> That still gives you no right to put a bulls-eye on my family's back!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you do, John.
Who is the one person Mike believes will stand by him no matter what, which makes her the one person he won't believe when she says he didn't completely fail.<eos> How important is the meeting with Ellis?<eos> He says it's urgent.<eos> Tell him I have to reschedule.<eos> That's weird.<eos> I already did.<eos> Rachel or Donna?<eos> Who told you to check up on me?<eos> You don't think I'd do that on my own?<eos> No, I don't.
What if you could bring my parents back to life?<eos> Because both those things have about the same chance of happening.<eos> - Mike, I'm trying to help you.<eos> - And I appreciate that.<eos> But I only have two references, Harvey, you, who has to lie for me, and Jonathan, who wants to kill me.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Harvey, it's enough.<eos> As much as you want to help me, you have no idea what it is to have been a fraud and have to start all over.<eos> I don't.<eos> But someone else does.
Then you have them.<eos> - Rachel, are you okay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I just can't be here, and I can't be at home.<eos> I can't be anywhere.<eos> Go see him.<eos> I don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
What she did is between the two of them, and I'm not gonna get in the middle of it one way or another, but if I did, it sure as shit wouldn't be to defend her.<eos> Harvey, your lack of emotional awareness never ceases to amaze me.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm not asking you to do this for Rachel.<eos> I'm asking you to do this for Mike.<eos> Like I said, I'm busy.<eos> May I?<eos> Since when do you need permission?<eos> To come in, I don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Mike Ross is not coming back to this firm.<eos> You heard Louis.<eos> He already gave him the job.<eos> He can un-give him the job.<eos> It's too late for that, and you know it.<eos> Well, it damn sure didn't help when you jumped on in there and told him it was a great choice.<eos> It was a great choice, and if I hadn't jumped in and let you speak your mind, you know what he would have heard?<eos> Something's wrong with Mike Ross.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do, and so do you.
You're really gonna drop me?<eos> You're damn right I am.<eos> And if you go to Jessica to try to overrule me, the next time, it won't be Mike you get in a fight with.<eos> It'll be me.<eos> You're home.<eos> I am.<eos> Why aren't you at work?<eos> Because I spent the whole day moving from one place to another, and I just had to talk to you.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
Baby!<eos> [Pounding on door] James!<eos> I'm not your son.<eos> Go away.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Thomas, it's the police.<eos> Where's Judith?<eos> Thomas, unlock the door.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
That's not what I asked.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Of course I want the baby.<eos> It's your child, so it's my child.<eos> You look so surprised.<eos> I guess I am.<eos> A little.<eos> My sister has to stop calling.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Luisa, he really doesn't...
I know.<eos> - Not as hot as you, of course.<eos> - Clearly, or you wouldn't be texting me every minute she's not around.<eos> She's like a cash machine for my blow.<eos> Are you kidding me? !<eos> You've been using me and sleeping with her? !<eos> - Charlotte, we... We were just...<eos> - Save it!<eos> I thought you cared.<eos> Of course I do, babe, but...
- The journals.<eos> They gave me the strength to survive.<eos> Hopefully they'll do the same for you, and maybe you'll understand why I did the things that I did.<eos> You spent three years fighting for a family that was right in front of you.<eos> And instead of embracing me, you used me and lied to me?<eos> Charlotte...<eos> Do you hear yourself?<eos> You chose revenge over me.<eos> I didn't think I had the choice.<eos> Well, you did.
Since when?<eos> You never told me about that.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I told you last week.<eos> And I told you yesterday.<eos> Well, reschedule her.<eos> You know she can't reschedule.<eos> it would've been nice to have been told.<eos> - Rush, I told you.<eos> - No, you didn't.

Ah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> _<eos> It's extraordinary.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Michi Kakutani will flip for this, and she hates everything.<eos> So you...<eos> - you want to publish it?<eos> - I do.
Bullshit!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You are protecting yourself...<eos> Now you're gathering evidence against me, so you can take my children!<eos> You think, for one moment, that some judge is gonna look at that tape of a father defending his daughter and see some violent man who doesn't deserve<eos> - custody of his children?<eos> - I hate you so much!<eos> If you want to divorce me, that's one thing, but that shit is fucking beneath you.<eos> I don't want to divorce you, you asshole!<eos> - You don't?
I-I don't think it's fixable.<eos> Okay, what if we go see another therapist?<eos> It's not gonna bring him back.<eos> I know that.<eos> And that is the only thing that can fix this for me.<eos> - No.<eos> - I look at you.<eos> And I see his face.<eos> People survive this.<eos> They do.
It's a treacherous journey.<eos> You will need your strength.<eos> Eat this.<eos> Oh, my God, you have food.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't make sense?<eos> How Adalind did this.<eos> For this to have worked,<eos> Adalind would've had to have lost her powers at some point.<eos> Uh, yeah, she did.
If you don't undo what you did, I'm gonna have to come after you.<eos> Do... do you get me?<eos> That's not a real threat.<eos> Uh, you know what a real threat is?<eos> The IRS looking into your finances for the last ten years and discovering what it is you actually do for a living.<eos> And all that would take would be one phone call.<eos> You got me? Yo! Ha ha.<eos> We got our cleanup hitter back.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> How you doing? Darryl.

About Reed?<eos> He said that Reed was the most... brilliant man he'd ever met.<eos> Ma'am, the car's out front.<eos> Take care of Frank.<eos> He's on the throne now.<eos> That's what really killed Reed, you know?<eos> The gadget.<eos> I don't know how many different ways I can say this.<eos> Even if I had known about an inside man in Werner Heisenberg's staff...<eos> - Which you didn't.

You also are acquainted with a professor Richard Lavro who traded his office at Harvard for one in Stalin's atomic research division, an association you misrepresented the last time we met.<eos> If Charles Isaacs is not a spy, we'd expect him to be forthcoming and cooperative, and yet you have lied since the moment you set foot into this room.<eos> So I'm your unified theory, is that right, genius?<eos> That every scientific failure, every intelligence slip up, I'm singlehandedly responsible?<eos> I'm not so sure it was singlehanded.<eos> The Perlmans are your wife's cousins?<eos> What role did Abby play in all of this?<eos> Paul.<eos> Didn't think you had the first idea where I lived.<eos> I didn't.
Well, now I know that you're lying.<eos> She hated Lancefield.<eos> She wouldn't go anywhere near him.<eos> Yes, well, of course you're right.<eos> But you see, that foreign wife of his, she had an interesting story, too.<eos> One about romancing your wife while you were at work.<eos> Your wife is a complicated woman, Dr. Isaacs.<eos> But as soon as she realized that she might very well lose her son, getting her to admit what you've done was simple.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> But you do.
Pop?<eos> Francis, I'm in the sunroom.<eos> I'm having a whiskey.<eos> You want one?<eos> We have a guest.<eos> Well, does he want one?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Nope, I know.<eos> So, I've done business with Hoffman.<eos> He's a good detective.<eos> Why did he steal your collar?<eos> We graduated from the academy together.<eos> He was second in the class.<eos> So he just has it out for number one?<eos> I don't know what his problem is.<eos> But he made detective and you haven't yet, so maybe you have the same kind of problem.<eos> Maybe I do.
- Cornrows!<eos> Why?<eos> My ex-wife and her fiance go to Jamaica all the time.<eos> "Jamaican me marry you."<eos> So good!<eos> So...<eos> I still don't have a date.<eos> Unless this sweet maize-head has changed your mind.<eos> I think we both know it hasn't.<eos> We do.
Watching each breath they take, praying it won't be their last.<eos> To hold your daughter's hand, trying to memorize what it feels like so you won't forget.<eos> Your daughter too scared to close her eyes, even when she's so tired, because she's worried she won't be able to open them again.<eos> Some things you just can't fix.<eos> You got to live with them.<eos> You don't take innocent lives.<eos> We shouldn't be listening to this.<eos> That man deserved to die.<eos> They all deserved to feel my pain!<eos> No, they didn't.
I spent seven years in one.<eos> Tell us about your employment history.<eos> Yes, ah, I know it's been... well it's been eighteen-and-a-half years since my last job.<eos> Ah, I stopped work to raise... my two beautiful children.<eos> Shit.<eos> What was that about?<eos> I need you to call Liz.<eos> Why?<eos> Have you got a problem?<eos> Ah, yeah I do.
- OKAY, OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT CARLA, AND THE OTHER ONE-- - MACIE-LYNN?<eos> - I MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH THEM ALSO.<eos> - AND IF YOU DID, IT WAS CONSENSUAL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SHAKIR?<eos> - YES, ABSOLUTELY.<eos> I MEAN, SO I WASN'T ALL WARM AND CUDDLY AFTERWARDS.<eos> I LIKE SLEEPING ALONE.<eos> YOU KNOW, SPENDING THE NIGHT, SPOONING, IT'S NOT PART OF THE SHAKIR WILKINS EXPERIENCE.<eos> - CAN'T BLAME YOU THERE.<eos> NOW BY THE WAY, DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR AMBIEN OR XANAX?<eos> - YES, OF COURSE I DO.
- YES, THANK YOU.<eos> - BUT ISN'T IT TRUE YOU'RE ONLY TESTIFYING TODAY IN EXCHANGE FOR AVOIDING CHARGES OF BRIBING A WITNESS?<eos> - I'M TESTIFYING HERE TODAY BECAUSE I MADE A WRONG DECISION, AND FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE.<eos> - BUT NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED.<eos> - CORRECT.<eos> - AT THE TIME THESE COMPLAINANTS CAME FORWARD, DID YOU BELIEVE THEIR STORIES?<eos> - NO, I DID NOT.<eos> I SIMPLY COULDN'T THINK THAT THE MAN I KNEW WAS CAPABLE OF DOING THE THINGS THEY SAID HE WAS DOING.<eos> - BUT NOW YOU DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKIR WILKINS ASSAULTED THESE THREE WOMEN?<eos> - YES, I DO.
Jake, can I borrow your jacket?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You still look good in my jackets, too.<eos> What do you mean, still?<eos> Who're you texting, Sadie?<eos> It's Sergio. He is such an idiot!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You like him.<eos> Disgusting!<eos> I do not.
I was worried about the first song we were tracking because it's a complex song.<eos> For us, it's a new feel.<eos> It's kind of groovy.<eos> And we're not really like the groovy band.<eos> It gets a little fucking like '70s porno music in the middle and I love it.<eos> It's totally shaft.<eos> It's totally shaft.<eos> The way that we're recording this record logistically we need to do a song a week.<eos> So, usually when you make a record you do all the drums up front for the whole record and that takes weeks usually.<eos> Then you do all the bass tracks.
Is it true?<eos> - I'm... I'm sorry, Alex.<eos> - Claire...<eos> Look, the truth is, I wasn't actually going to tell you.<eos> I thought it would be better if you didn't know.<eos> How could that ever be better?<eos> Because you can't be a father to this child.<eos> That isn't your choice to make.<eos> You have no idea what kind of father I'd be.<eos> Yes, I do, Alex, and so do you.
- I think you should stop whining.<eos> I'm just saying, what if Lin ain't moving his shit today?<eos> What if you stopped asking questions?<eos> What if you weren't such a dick?<eos> What if, when we're done here, we go to your house and I rape your mama?<eos> What if you find her on top of your dad slamming a big black dildo in his ass while he's calling out my name?<eos> - Nice touch.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
Will I?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I tried to kill her.<eos> Last night, I went out of my mind, and I started a fire.<eos> But she survived.<eos> And she knows it was me.<eos> And I have never been more afraid.<eos> - You don't know what she's capable of.<eos> - Oh, I do.
- Mr. Queen, I met your father once.<eos> Charity event.<eos> One of the things we spoke of was you.<eos> I think he would be very proud of the man you've become.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And please, call me oliver.<eos> There is something off about that guy.<eos> - Captain singh approved the task force.<eos> You wanted me to believe the flash was real.<eos> Now I do.
That's right.<eos> Hypotheticals only.<eos> - The one with the silver teeth.<eos> - Jim Lenard.<eos> He'll make a good witness...<eos> He's likable.<eos> So is Trey.<eos> Trey was the one wearing the wire.<eos> You said you didn't know who was wearing the wire.<eos> I didn't, until today.
So young.<eos> Young and in love.<eos> And... when my mother found out I was pregnant, she made my decision for me.<eos> So she took you out of school for the year and made it look like you were in France?<eos> She did. But I never left the country.<eos> Wait, so your mother handled the adoption?<eos> Well, she tried to involve Fin's mother, but Mrs. Nightingale would have nothing to do with it.<eos> From my understanding, there was a very large payment to keep my family quiet.<eos> - And Fin never knew?<eos> - No, he didn't.
I mean, I've followed every lead, I've called any...<eos> Look, when I told you not to look into it, I mean it.<eos> - I know, but Toby...<eos> - The last time she was in my life, people got hurt, Tia.<eos> Toby, I'm not afraid.<eos> And I'm not a case.<eos> I'm not a story, don't be a reporter.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> OK...<eos> I didn't...
It does.<eos> So, what's gonna happen now, Bobby?<eos> What's gonna come of all this?<eos> Not sure.<eos> Does Jax know?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> We're with him.<eos> Well, you love him.<eos> I can see that.<eos> We all do.
When can I go home, Daddy?<eos> - Soon, buddy.<eos> - Did somebody die?<eos> Some friends of ours got hurt.<eos> We just want to make sure everyone's okay.<eos> - That's why we're all here.<eos> - Do you take care of all<eos> - these people?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do, son.
Retaliation, uh... club is convinced that they killed Tara.<eos> Jax took out one of, uh, Lin's gun shipments... blood for blood.<eos> How do you know that, Wayne?<eos> Reliable source.<eos> Reach out to Stockton and Oakland PD.<eos> Have them put a tail out on, uh,<eos> Henry Lin and, uh, his known associates.<eos> I think something is gonna go down in Stockton port.<eos> - I got to know who told you...<eos> - No, you don't!
Yeah, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm sorry I'm just putting more stuff on top of everything else.<eos> But after these last few days...<eos> Before you say no just think about it a little, okay?<eos> Take into consideration all the bad shit that's happened here.<eos> We deserve something better, Gemma.<eos> Do we?<eos> Yes, baby.<eos> Yes, we do. We do.
You can't let this pull you off track, Jackie.<eos> Those guys downstairs... they need you focused... and strong.<eos> Look what I've done, man.<eos> Diosa...<eos> Colette...<eos> West.<eos> Now Bobby.<eos> Hey.<eos> Bobby knows the risks.<eos> We all do.
And I'm supposed to believe this?<eos> Where's Milner? Wilson, you need to take them seriously.<eos> What they're saying is...<eos> - Where is Milner?<eos> - What, you gonna torture us, Wilson?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I might. I might do, Becky.<eos> Russian flu is real.<eos> It's some psychopathic weaponised virus from the '60s and they're going to release it, did you know that?<eos> - What? You did?
It's amazing, to put a man in hospital and never see the inside of a police station.<eos> Lucky for you that your father-in-law is a very experienced lawyer, non?<eos> Anyone else...<eos> Could you tell me what this has to do with my son being abducted?<eos> Are you a violent man, Mr Hughes?<eos> In September 2004, your son was almost three years old.<eos> You took him into hospital.<eos> He had a fracture on his ankle.<eos> - You think I had something to do with this?<eos> - Did you?
Death papers.<eos> Okay.<eos> I loved Tara very much.<eos> Don't.<eos> This is not an excuse.<eos> I'm not defending myself.<eos> I barely remember what happened that night.<eos> But it happened.<eos> Yes.<eos> It did.
I can't allow that.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> So you're martyring yourself, taking me along for the ride.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I am sorry, Tex.<eos> - Sorry!<eos> It was the proper command decision.<eos> - It wasn't worth the risk.<eos> - They need you.<eos> - No, they don't.
That's unlike you.<eos> I mean, you're all about the big moments.<eos> You wrote her a song for your one-week anniversary.<eos> You got to take it easy on me...<eos> The falsetto's too much, huh?<eos> It's really good.<eos> You know, you're right, though.<eos> I mean, she was freaking out ever since I said I was crashing there.<eos> She wants a commitment.<eos> Yeah, of course she does, dude.
My children, my grandchildren...<eos> My brothers.<eos> Stand up, Ventura!<eos> - The fight has just begun.<eos> - I'm dying.<eos> Relax, Ventura.<eos> I'll never die.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> But your night does.
I don't know what you heard, but let me set things straight.<eos> In order to get my job back, I put myself out there as dirty.<eos> I never agreed, nor did I ever report on another cop.<eos> - I know what you're feeling.<eos> - You don't.
To Utah.<eos> Your father wants us to stay on for good.<eos> You still ain't said if that's what you want.<eos> I can't think about goin' back.<eos> Naomi.<eos> We're better off here.<eos> Me and William, and don't say that you don't see that.<eos> You ain't had it easy in Cheyenne.<eos> I know that, all right?<eos> I do.
Aah!<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was me at the Grounder camp.<eos> You now, I did everything I could not scream, but eventually... but eventually, you broke and you told them everything.<eos> And you wouldn't have because you're better than me.<eos> Damn right.<eos> I'm not a traitor.<eos> I didn't tell them where they could find us.<eos> And I did.<eos> Yeah, I did.
What are you talking about?<eos> I refuse to spend the remaining years of my life cooped up in some attic making tables and goddamn chairs.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You're an elder statesman, Edward.<eos> We need your insight.<eos> Any insight I had has been imparted long ago.<eos> You're ready, Becca.<eos> You and Claire, you're ready.<eos> Edward, we need you.<eos> Not like this, you don't.
Is it true?<eos> - I'm... I'm sorry, Alex.<eos> - Claire...<eos> Look, the truth is, I wasn't actually going to tell you.<eos> I thought it would be better if you didn't know.<eos> How could that ever be better?<eos> Because you can't be a father to this child.<eos> That isn't your choice to make.<eos> You have no idea what kind of father I'd be.<eos> Yes, I do, Alex, and so do you.
But I have a forgiving heart, Claire, especially for the ones I love.<eos> And I will proudly raise this child as if it was my own.<eos> I'll protect it with my life.<eos> William...<eos> Probably silly to think flowers would cheer you up in a moment like this, but I thought I'd give it a go.<eos> My favorite flowers.<eos> Well, at least they used to be.<eos> Desert sage.<eos> Why did you want to delay Gabriel's execution?<eos> I didn't.
Cool. So she's okay?<eos> She survived?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, it didn't even... it didn't even come up this time.<eos> - Yeah, I'm just gonna wait until the next therapy, because, yeah, our shrink was a little late, which started the session out weird.<eos> Barb started talking about how her sister's lupus is affecting her.<eos> Did I tell you that Barb's sister Joni has lupus?<eos> No.<eos> Well, she does.
Oh, man, I can't get...<eos> - Who makes these freakin' things?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Are you wet?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You seem so wet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally wet.<eos> You want this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He wants out.<eos> He wants out.<eos> Does Ed have end of life directives?<eos> - No extreme measures.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Shell.<eos> We have options.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> - We do.
- No extreme measures.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Shell.<eos> We have options.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> - We do.<eos> Okay, you say it.<eos> I googled.<eos> Sometimes I do some googling.
It's all I know.<eos> I swear.<eos> Lock him up.<eos> Prep the prisoners for load-up.<eos> We ain't leaving' for two hours.<eos> Adapt or die, Atwood.<eos> Adapt or die.<eos> We still need to sweep the town.<eos> We ain't got time...<eos> And neither does Bohannon.
Mount Cypress.<eos> Mount Freelance.<eos> Sarah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> Easy, conceited.<eos> I had no idea you'd be here.<eos> - Alex...<eos> - He didn't.
Mount Freelance.<eos> Sarah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> Easy, conceited.<eos> I had no idea you'd be here.<eos> - Alex...<eos> - He didn't.<eos> - Neither did I.
I loved him.<eos> Or I... I had a feeling that felt a lot like love.<eos> In the name of that feeling... I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.<eos> You name the cliché, that was me.<eos> And so how did it end?<eos> Rush got me out.<eos> The rest doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> It matters a lot.<eos> Oh, no... it doesn't.
The boy is going to love it.<eos> - You do not know if it is a boy, then.<eos> - There will be a boy, I know.<eos> - Looking for this?<eos> - Hello?<eos> I always knew I would get a violent death.<eos> But I was not prepared for the humiliation by being killed with knitting needles.<eos> By a Norwegian.<eos> I admire you.<eos> I do it.
- No.<eos> I'm not totally up and running yet, like pure ICT-wise, so...<eos> Welcome you should be.<eos> Did you know that in Iraq, they have 33 words for corruption and not one only for seminar?<eos> - No?<eos> You kidding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ok, but then we'll see?<eos> - We do that, Bo.<eos> So do we.

I like Connie.<eos> - Hello, beauties.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Where you been?<eos> My God, have you guys been at the lake?<eos> You have to go.<eos> It's like bath water.<eos> - It's disgusting.<eos> - We don't do lake.
I-I want you to know, I never intended to leave you, not like this, not on our wedding day, but I-it wasn't my choice.<eos> I wish I could tell you what's going on.<eos> I... wish I could explain.<eos> But just know that I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> Always.<eos> The ones to Alexis and my mother were pretty much the same.<eos> Kate, what did I do? Mm.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
So you can find it?<eos> Theoretically, but comparing this data set to global 3D mapping would take forever and more computing power than I have.<eos> What if we narrowed it to just one city?<eos> Montreal? Could you do it then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Best I can do is try.<eos> Can't imagine how freaky it must be getting a message like that from myself and not remember recording it.<eos> How's he doing with it all?<eos> He needs answers.<eos> We both do.
We don't expect you to.<eos> I'll get you some proper clothes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother's flat... in Pochep... is smaller than this room.<eos> You could fit in the whole flat in here.<eos> Twice.<eos> Mariana won't believe me that I stay in a place like this.<eos> You think I'm stupid to think Mariana is alive.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
How is that working out for you?<eos> Pfft. How's it look?<eos> One patch is not enough.<eos> Yeah, I could have told you that from your chewed-up fingernails.<eos> That's a pretty good parlor trick, Detective.<eos> You putting those skills to work out in the field yet?<eos> I got a lead on Wendy Montgomery's murder, that realtor who was shot walking home from work.<eos> Looked like a mugging.<eos> Yeah, her husband was the prime suspect, but we didn't have any real leads.<eos> Well, we do now.
Please. Em.<eos> Believe me - they know each other.<eos> Em... .. if we keep shutting each other out...<eos> .. we're going to lose each other.<eos> And if that happens, what else is there?<eos> They know each other.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
How much?<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.<eos> It's over.<eos> Our calf will die of cold if she's left out in the field all night.<eos> I... I know you don't like my husband, or our family, but PLEASE can we have the cowshed tonight?<eos> If I give you extra time, what will it be next week?<eos> You can't go on like this.<eos> I think that's why you're here.<eos> The calf needs warmth.<eos> So do I.

- To the south of France.<eos> - Oh, nice.<eos> It's a long way by coach.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just, you know... - the environment.<eos> - Yes, we should all think of that.<eos> I don't want to sound like a twat, but I just...<eos> You know, I do think that we've all got a responsibility. - I just do.<eos> - No, you're right, we do.<eos> We all do.
Uh, actually, can we talk for a second?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Thanks.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Look, how do I...<eos> I really like you.<eos> But...<eos> - You're married.<eos> - Right.<eos> - And you have a family.<eos> - I do.
Okay.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's o...<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - I don't have a fucking car.<eos> - I don't...
- It's okay.<eos> Come on, I'll walk you to the station.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I don't want to bump into anyone you know.<eos> When are we gonna see each other again?<eos> Soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
One I hope you're not getting mixed up with.<eos> No.<eos> I'm just doing Sara a favor.<eos> And her?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oliver told me of his plan to involve you in the hunt for Sara's killer.<eos> Your father doesn't know, does he?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
We had heard rumors Merlyn fathered another child.<eos> We couldn't confirm them.<eos> You know who it is.<eos> I do.<eos> If you put me through the effort of finding out on my own...<eos> I might have to exact a price from whoever it is you're protecting.<eos> It's Thea.<eos> My sister is Merlyn's daughter.<eos> And that is the reason he came back to Starling City.<eos> Because she did.
I apologize for barging in like this, but we have news from one of our scouts.<eos> Have you found Anna?<eos> No, but they discovered something else in their search.<eos> What does it say?<eos> There's an army massing in the southern mountains, heading for Arendelle.<eos> Led by Prince Hans.<eos> Well, I know every inch of those mountains.<eos> Let me sneak up there and see what he's up to.<eos> I didn't realize the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer got a say in matters.<eos> He doesn't.
And all the cool stuff you can buy too.<eos> Velma, please.<eos> It's a family emergency.<eos> You must come to my office as soon as possible.<eos> I'm texting you my address.<eos> Whoops. Looks like we lost him.<eos> Moving on.<eos> He said it was an emergency.<eos> We need to meet him right away.<eos> - We don't, Freddy.
I just wanted to see where you work.<eos> And I thought, you know... maybe we could get together again.<eos> Get together?<eos> Yeah, like lunch or dinner or...<eos> - whenever you get off.<eos> - You got the wrong idea.<eos> Wh... (sighs)<eos> What we did... that was a one-time thing.<eos> - (laughs) It doesn't have to be.<eos> - Yes, it does.
There's stumbling upon something You don't want to see, And then there's literally stumbling upon something<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey. How's p.T.?<eos> Long and boring. [ chuckles ]<eos> I should go.<eos> I can't miss my weigh-in.<eos> [ grunts ] Emma's pretty great, isn't she?<eos> Yeah, she is. [ grunts ] You know we, uh...<eos> No, no, I didn't.
It's not like your job depends On whether miss thing pees clean. [ sighs ]<eos> I told kara she could invite a friend, Even though I knew it was stupid, But I did it so she would shut the hell up.<eos> And then her heart monitor went off, and... It was my fault.<eos> So, I thought if we spent the day together, I might find one thing not to hate about her.<eos> I just need one thing, some shred of humanity.<eos> Because right now, I hate her so damn much I'm afraid one day I won't answer her call button Just to spite her.<eos> And then maybe she really will end up dead, And it'll be on me.<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
David, you were supposed to stay here last night to protect her.<eos> I tried to.<eos> I snuck into Emily Thorne's house last night.<eos> What?<eos> David, what did you do?<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> I came close...<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> - Did she see you?<eos> - No. - Did anyone?
Thank you. (Whistling)<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!<eos> A round of applause if you think that, hmm...<eos> W.C. Fields should win - the audience prize! - (Booing)<eos> - I don't even have to ask, do I?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Once again, the audience prize goes to...<eos> - ... Mr. Bert Grady!<eos> - (George): He deserves it.<eos> (Henry): Yes he does.
Sometimes the vengeful spirits, when they can't get their revenge... tend to turn into evil spirits because of their anger.<eos> So are you saying that they've become evil spirits?<eos> I hope not.<eos> If someone manipulates their anger in a bad way... we won't be able to stop them.<eos> That's what worries me.<eos> We might not be able to stop them...<eos> Do Ha.<eos> Is Sadam really the only reason why you're still in the capital?<eos> You know what he means to me.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> To divert our intruder's attention while we worked to restore your speed.<eos> You used him as a distraction?<eos> An unnecessary one, as it turns out.<eos> It seems the plan has failed. I...<eos> I have his blood on me.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> You're showing a lot of sentiment for a man who tormented you as a child.<eos> Tony might have been a bully then and now, but he didn't deserve to die.<eos> Does Caitlin or Cisco or me or you?
Are we not ladies? !<eos> You're voters.<eos> You're not second class any more.<eos> Socialists in shorts.<eos> And they're a cycling club?<eos> I don't care if it's the Coconut Club.<eos> I'm not voting for anyone that wants to show me his knees.<eos> You won't remember me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
But sometimes they don't work and a skirt can get caught.<eos> So...<eos> Bloomers.<eos> I've, erm...<eos> I've never been on a bicycle before.<eos> You look exhausted, Mrs...?<eos> Hankin.<eos> Every night when I get into bed, I hope things will be... better.<eos> I understand.<eos> You do?
'When you're young and time takes an age, 'it feels like nothing will ever change.<eos> 'But it does.
Who's first?<eos> Mrs Middleton.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can the workers in your factory rely on you, Mr Allingham?<eos> Could you repeat the question a little louder, so everyone hears it?<eos> I was wondering whether the workers in your factory can rely on you.<eos> The factory has provided employment for half the village since 1904.<eos> We provided thousands of pairs of boots for our brave men at the Front and it provided employment for you, when hard times on your farm meant that you needed the work.<eos> Now that, through his hard work and determination, things are looking so much better for your husband, well, you don't need the work.<eos> Agnes Scrivener does.
No, please, no.<eos> You can't leave now.<eos> I am no use to you here.<eos> If you turn around and run away then you're no use to anyone.<eos> ~ Please, let us sit and talk.<eos> ~ There's nothing to talk about!<eos> Do you want to talk about this?<eos> The police were outside last time also... .. and yet I almost bled to death.<eos> I understand how much you want to find your son.<eos> No, you don't.
He must have been in such a hurry.<eos> He was in a hurry 'cause he was ashamed.<eos> I want to just get this over with.<eos> - Jessica, what...<eos> - Am I doing here?<eos> I'm here to tell you that I know you know the truth about Louis' resignation.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Yes, you do, and I'm guessing you didn't like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
I'm gonna tell you something, and I don't want you to overreact.<eos> From the look on your face, I'm not makin' any promises.<eos> I just got an email from Louis.<eos> He's going after Versalife.<eos> - Get me Ray.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> Get me Ray!<eos> Harvey, it was just a notification email.<eos> You don't even know where he is!<eos> Yes, I do.
Called you back about what?<eos> I asked him to hire Louis anyway.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I even told him if he did I'd owe him one.<eos> - Hmm. - What?<eos> Oh, I'm just tryin' to figure out at what point in the last week you decided to become a pussy.<eos> Oh, so doing something nice for someone makes you a pussy?<eos> - I didn't say that exactly.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I'm afraid your journey has been somewhat wasted.<eos> Mr Thorogood!<eos> Matthew!<eos> It's Mr Whicher!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Are you looking for Matthew?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I don't mean him any trouble.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> If only I did.
None of that kiddie, plastic crap all over the place.<eos> Stop!<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> [Sniffs deeply] I want children.<eos> Like, a lot of children.<eos> I want this place to look like a damn orphanage.<eos> And when your womb gives out, we're gonna fly around the world.<eos> We're gonna collect them like stamps... like precious, little, lovable stamps.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You did?
You don't?<eos> I don't.<eos> And last night was the most intimate non-sexual encounter I've ever had.<eos> - [Laughs] Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I know way more about you now than if we had just had sex last night.<eos> Me, too.<eos> In fact...<eos> You think... we should...<eos> I do.
No, it's just this thing with Dana.<eos> I don't think it's gonna work out.<eos> Oh. Yeah, but you're a dating Jedi.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Use the force to solve all your problems.<eos> Well, I resign as a dating Jedi.<eos> And plus, that shows a total misunderstanding of the way the force works.<eos> Do you want my advice or not?<eos> Because I know what the problem is.<eos> - You do? - Mm-hmm.
Hit my head against a wall.<eos> A wall.<eos> The wall.<eos> Wall.<eos> Wall.<eos> The pretty ones are always crazy, son.<eos> I'm just gonna enter the changes manually.<eos> It's gonna be a lot slower, but I don't need electricity.<eos> Well, you know, you got a room full of people and a wall full of typewriters.<eos> I do.
Hi.<eos> So, how did you, uh, enjoy the lecture?<eos> Oh, yeah. Um...<eos> Look, I'm really sorry about all that.<eos> No.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> Except... except that it was about you, so... In that way, it totally is your fault.<eos> Look, I'm not making any excuses for him.<eos> Peter mentioned that you told him you want to get back together with me.<eos> I did.

This is nice.<eos> You know, the Nazis used it as the official theme music for their weekly newsreel service.<eos> Even they could see the beauty in it.<eos> It reminds you that the people who do these terrible things, they are just people.<eos> Not some kind of devils.<eos> Just ordinary people.<eos> That's why you wanted Tony Hughes' bank statements?<eos> You think he could...<eos> I think I need to know everything.<eos> At the moment I don't.
But... .. he won't talk.<eos> Not unless they pay him.<eos> How much?<eos> 15,000 euros.<eos> For information you have no idea is any good?<eos> Is he nuts?<eos> You're thinking of paying.<eos> We don't have 15,000 euros, Em.<eos> We... don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
Khalid Ziane.<eos> Khalid Charmataines.<eos> I have nothing to say about my father.<eos> Anouar!<eos> Anouar, your father... Your father knows something.<eos> Something that could help us find our son.<eos> But he won't tell us, not unless you agree to meet him.<eos> ~ You must know what my father did.<eos> ~ Yes, we understand that.<eos> No, you don't.
Sophia Russo's neighbor?<eos> Yeah, I wanted to show her the video of our guy at the gay bar.<eos> You did?<eos> - She wouldn't give me the time of day, and it wasn't just that she was uncooperative. She was scared.<eos> She didn't like the people that were hanging around Sophia.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Thanks for doing that, Dad.<eos> Yeah, well, you need help, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, we need to solve this trouble.<eos> I hate to be the one to ask this, but...<eos> Are you sure Audrey's still in there?<eos> If you'd asked me this morning, I would have said definitely, but now...<eos> Just have to keep trying.<eos> Well, threatening her with the taser works.<eos> Yeah, now we just got to get Audrey out.<eos> What would Nathan do right now?<eos> - I thought you knew me so well.<eos> - Oh, I do.
Damn!<eos> Oh. My bad.<eos> I mean... damn.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're all here.<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> Jordi's in recovery.<eos> He's good.<eos> He did, uh... He did real well.
This kid comes in alone, no family, trying to save his own life,<eos> I mean, it just sneaks up on you.<eos> Just figure out how you're gonna break the news to Jordi.<eos> I'll deal with Leo.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> - No, really. It's fine.<eos> You don't want me talking to Leo.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I do.
Um, I'm sorry.<eos> Wait, E-Elise.<eos> Wait, Elise.<eos> Got your text. You okay?<eos> - You know where Leo is?<eos> - Leo?<eos> Leo said he'd come to see me after my surgery, but he hasn't been here all day.<eos> He knows about my leg, doesn't he?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Uh, there was a lake in the town where I grew up.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Western Pennsylvania... little town called St. George.<eos> Is that Amish country?<eos> Coal, actually.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> Now they're all fracking and lighting their faucets on fire, I think.<eos> I haven't been back in a while.<eos> So you still have family there?<eos> I do... my father.
Oh. One right here.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> And... - there we go. - Oh.<eos> Worm-free.<eos> It's terrible to have those little monsters inside you.<eos> You don't want them to come out because they hurt so much, but... they have to come out.<eos> If they stay inside, they kill you.<eos> You don't know what I mean, do you?<eos> What? I-I do, actually.
Okay.<eos> You're a fucking puppet, whoever you are.<eos> I'm a patriot, you understand?<eos> I'm a freedom fighter.<eos> Say something, you fucking jerk.<eos> What are you, a robot?<eos> A fucking socialist robot?<eos> Sell your soul for some shitty car and a three-bed house you never even pay out.<eos> You don't even understand what it means to be free.<eos> Nobody does anymore.
Have you ever heard of acoustic cryptoanalysis?<eos> The analysis of the sound produced during encryption processing...<eos> We know what it is.<eos> Yeah, well, I run that puppy, chances are it can reverse-code even the most secure site.<eos> Not even the FBI has that capability.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> Let him try it.<eos> He has no clearance.<eos> He does now.
He would just end up being arrested with the weapon and the investigation would have fallen out of her hands.<eos> Shit, if you're right, she's an evil genius.<eos> Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon, he'll just be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop.<eos> What's the matter, Mr. Blake?<eos> You forget your code?<eos> Turn around.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> An ATM? You can't see the code.<eos> Turn around.<eos> You done?
Intolerable!<eos> - End of the summer, huh?<eos> - Shit.<eos> Heading back to Gotham soon?<eos> Sure am, today, actually.<eos> Looks like you got away with it.<eos> You know what I just realized?<eos> I could tell your wife.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Get in the car.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - You okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> You ever ask her how she found out, huh?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Who told her I called the cops?<eos> - She saw you call the cops.<eos> - Cole, come on.<eos> No, she didn't.
- I need to speak to him.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - Don't give me that bullshit.<eos> - Hey.<eos> If he's on a mission, there's a way to reach him.<eos> Actually, there's not.<eos> They went dark a little over an hour ago.<eos> I was just on the phone to Ops 4.<eos> When do they check in next?<eos> They don't.
Well, not since we sold it. Mmm.<eos> - Had some good times on that boat.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Be fun to see who has her now.<eos> No calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> I'm good.<eos> My union rep advised me not to come down here, but I told him you and I got history.<eos> And we do. Yeah.
Danny, it wasn't an easy decision.<eos> Yeah, well, it was a lot tougher for Marcus Greene.<eos> And I know 'cause I'm the one that had to call him and give him the bad news and listen to him cry on the telephone.<eos> Don't be too hard on your brother.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I could've sworn I was the injured party there.<eos> It's personal with him.<eos> Come on, it's always personal for him.<eos> Doesn't give him the right to use me as a punching bag every time he doesn't get his way.<eos> No, it doesn't.
No way.<eos> You're not gonna do that, because you did it too, pal.<eos> But if you did it to Louis and you did it to me, you did it to a hundred others.<eos> And if you don't do what I'm asking, I'll just have to find the one in a hundred that's in a position to turn on you.<eos> I'll take my chances, Harvey.<eos> Now, get out of my face.<eos> Let me finish my cigar in peace.<eos> * Suits 4x09 * font color=#00FFFFGone Original Air Date on August 13, 2014<eos> - You know?<eos> - Of course I do.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're off the hook with Cahill.<eos> He's gonna start with me and Harvey in the morning.<eos> Am I?<eos> - Are you what?<eos> - Off the hook.<eos> Rachel...<eos> I didn't mean for what happened to happen.<eos> - But it did.
- I'm done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> And if I don't do something now, so are Harvey and Mike.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To finish what I started.<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> - What?<eos> I think we both could've used a better lawyer in that deposition.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> - No, I don't.
I'm just waiting for the genetic tests to confirm it.<eos> So there's nothing to be done.<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I'll keep monitoring him, but I want to transfer Tobias to the hospital as soon as possible.<eos> Look who comes to see me...<eos> My beautiful little Sashi.<eos> Good morning, Lorena.<eos> Divya...<eos> I hope you slept well.<eos> I did not.
Listen, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I-I thought...<eos> I do...<eos> Because I know what you're going through.<eos> I'm not sure you do.<eos> You're angry.<eos> You're scared.<eos> You want to get things on an even keel, controllable, knowable, calm.<eos> Okay, maybe you do.
- Why not?<eos> Don't say things that aren't true.<eos> It is true.<eos> I'll take you there one day.<eos> There's this little town by the water called Bodega Bay.<eos> It's kind of like here, actually.<eos> We'd drink wine all day on the beach and we'd stay in a cabin at night with a wood burning stove, no electricity.<eos> No Internet.<eos> Do you like teaching?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, Cherry, I can't.<eos> No, you must.<eos> Please, try it on.<eos> Try it on.<eos> I want to thank you for taking care of my son.<eos> He acts like he doesn't need anyone.<eos> And maybe you think he doesn't really need you.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I... I...<eos> He does.
I'm giving it to both of you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I should give you all my old wedding rings, too.<eos> - One couldn't possibly be enough.<eos> - Athena.<eos> - Alison?<eos> - Athena, don't.<eos> How many wedding rings do you have?<eos> I didn't get the monogamy gene, darling.<eos> Not everyone does.
Oh, come on, son.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You don't see it, Pops, do you?<eos> You didn't buy anybody.<eos> You didn't put Zale in your back pocket.<eos> You just became him!<eos> You became everything we suffered ignorance and brutality to change, that people died to overcome.<eos> You're the one who bought the lie.<eos> You believed that they had all the power.<eos> You still do.
Can you believe it?<eos> I can't, really.<eos> You okay?<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing. Just thinking about where all the time goes.<eos> Just thinking about time, huh?<eos> ( GIGGLES )<eos> Shut up! Come on, I know you.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You do.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Of course.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, everything looks great.<eos> So, unless you start having other health concerns, I'd say you're in good shape.<eos> Did you see your father this morning?<eos> I did.
Thank you.<eos> Good news.<eos> Just found out they're transferring Dr. Randy to a hospital in a different prison.<eos> And by the way, I was right.<eos> They found a wax key in his underwear.<eos> Apparently it took Churchill all night to tunnel out.<eos> Well, it's like my grandpappy used to say...<eos> Really? !<eos> You have a countryism for this?<eos> Yes, I do.
"I want you to come meet my new fiancée."<eos> Oh, that's a Swedish accent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did you say to the cops?<eos> Oh, I just called in a favor.<eos> I think we both know that you wouldn't do well in jail.<eos> I c... can't believe that you would do that after I acted like this psycho you suspected that I would be.<eos> Come on.<eos> Andrew, I know who you really are.<eos> Do you?
Of course not.<eos> - You could have stopped it.<eos> - I tried.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me what you did to stop an attack that canonized a terrorist and wiped out my entire station.<eos> It wasn't an attack.<eos> It was a goddamn coup.<eos> You think I want these people running Pakistan?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - I don't.
which wasn't always easy.<eos> This is Jane's fiancé.<eos> He's a detective.<eos> Their life was perfectly on track, until...<eos> Oh, there you are, Dr. Alver.<eos> You have an insemination in seven and a path in eight.<eos> ALVER: Yeah, an insemination and a path, yeah, I got it.<eos> Should I...<eos> No, I-I got it.<eos> She does not âgot it.â
Plus you took a picture of Brian Bell after you killed him, you e-mailed it to someone... on your phone.<eos> We call that a "death dunk."<eos> Mm-hmm. Death penalty slam dunk.<eos> E-mails between Papa Legba and our Mr. Howard discussing the hit, the price, everything.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I swear.<eos> That's the whole purpose of Chauvenet.<eos> It's anonymous.<eos> I have no idea who Papa Legba is.<eos> Nobody does.
Oh, many of our countrymen have settled there.<eos> Of course, they've lost everything, but so have we.<eos> Including the will to live.<eos> Well, if you're going to be miserable, you might as well do it in charming surroundings.<eos> With your permission, I am going up now.<eos> I hope you will be comfortable.<eos> My maid, Denker, will be looking after you.<eos> I will be more comfortable tonight than I will ever be again.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> But I do, Mrs Crawley.
- It's me.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Why?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> The police have been, Tommy.<eos> Tommy?<eos> They asked about Leonard's meds.<eos> He's the man pushing the meds trolley. Shh.<eos> What if I made a mistake with the dosage on the day he died?<eos> You didn't.
- No way!<eos> Cut her loose!<eos> Acid fog.<eos> Monroe, get back on the rope!<eos> Come on!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to take cover from the fog.<eos> Bellamy.<eos> No, we don't.
The Grounders took you to Mount Weather?<eos> No.<eos> The mountain men.<eos> We have to get them out.<eos> We're not doing this right now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Clarke.<eos> Mom.<eos> Did anyone else make it here?<eos> Yes. 6 of you did.
Wind blows it back up again - water cycle. Boom!<eos> Right, what else do you need to know for your CGCSEs?<eos> Mr Barber was going to teach us about the Ice Age.<eos> Right, the Ice Age.<eos> Ice Age...<eos> A while back, weren't it?<eos> Nippy. It's a lot of black ice - that's lethal.<eos> I mean, that's what killed the dinosaurs.<eos> You don't know anything about it, do you, sir?<eos> I do, actually!
You're improving.<eos> Okay, Labeaux made half a dozen calls to one number in the 48 hours before the original painting disappeared.<eos> The name is encrypted, but I think I can break it.<eos> In how long?<eos> That long.<eos> And I thought I didn't like him 'cause he was a know-it-all art jerk.<eos> Here's an e-mail from Labeaux to Paulson with his bank's routing and account numbers.<eos> Labeaux provides access to the fake, Paulson provides access to the original.<eos> We didn't find the painting at Labeaux's because he never had it.<eos> Paulson does.
And they died like this?<eos> What is it?<eos> I know how to stop the attack.<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> We should go.<eos> You ready?<eos> Even if you can save Lincoln... he won't be the same.<eos> The things he's done... they'll stay with him.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
They're here.<eos> Initiated evacuation plan 2A.<eos> Report to your station supervisor for further instructions.<eos> They're not attacking yet, which means we still have time.<eos> We have two hours till dawn.<eos> Let me talk to the commander.<eos> She was Anya's second.<eos> Maybe she'll listen.<eos> We don't even know if the commander's here.<eos> Yes, we do.
What did I do to you?<eos> Can you leave me?<eos> I want to sleep.<eos> Tell me. Kevin...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Please.<eos> You're right.<eos> I must stop calling you "my little turkey".<eos> You're too big, now.<eos> But what to do?
We were on our way to Baghdad.<eos> No, we weren't.<eos> It was Istanbul.<eos> Was it?<eos> We did go through Greece, though.<eos> And we climbed Mount Olympus.<eos> Do you remember being attacked by that dog?<eos> No.<eos> Do you remember a storm?<eos> No, I don't.
Shea Garcia-Miller.<eos> We were in the Principal's office together, and she turned on the music and started dancing.<eos> It's like... it's like I was in a trance, I was hypnotized.<eos> Marcus, I know exactly what's going on here.<eos> Did I accidentally take drugs?<eos> Because one time I doubled up on my multi-vitamins and... My day was a blur.<eos> You, my Lilliputian friend, have a crush.<eos> Big time!<eos> A real teenage crush.<eos> I do?
It wasn't easy going over the past 10 years.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to endure that.<eos> I'm grateful that you... That you were in D.C. with me this week and for confirming what I said.<eos> Reporter: They're on the move.<eos> No one will ever know what happened to Conrad.<eos> I promise, David.<eos> Can you imagine the headlines if they did?<eos> And we thought we'd create a scandal running away together. Remember?<eos> Seems like a lifetime ago.<eos> Yes, it does.
I fucking always totally think that it's fucking shit. You know?<eos> I can't think through all the babble.<eos> I only got through it last year because I was on drugs.<eos> I'm sorry, what's that?<eos> What's that?<eos> Just, like, pills, but 'they must've been pretty strong because I actually enjoyed myself.'<eos> That's cool.<eos> Don't say cool.<eos> I wish I had some drugs right now.<eos> No, you don't.
Ultimately the only thing you're worried about is the transition from one state to another, and that can't hurt you because it's...<eos> it's just a state change.<eos> Great stuff, kid.<eos> Almost word-for-word.<eos> That's exactly right, it's just a state change.<eos> Right.<eos> And it's frustrating cos you've always got these ten voices in your head saying,<eos> "Don't do it" and another ten in your head saying, "Do it".<eos> Which one do you listen to?<eos> The "do it"s.
Sometimes our kids get cabin fever and decide to go exploring.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> It's infected.<eos> Oh, that could be dangerous.<eos> Yeah, it could.<eos> We can help you.<eos> You've arrived at the Sisters of Mercy.<eos> Anytime now!<eos> You don't have to stay!<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, go get her.<eos> This is no time to sulk.<eos> It's all hands on deck.<eos> Any luck with the nurse, Max?<eos> Got a partial read on the name tag.<eos> I should be able to get a match from the hospital staff database.<eos> How do we know the drugs were for Haqqani himself?<eos> Because Aayan told me.<eos> But he didn't say what they were for?<eos> No, he didn't.
Now, this is totally unacceptable, Madam Ambassador.<eos> What's unacceptable is the double dealing your country's been engaged in for decades.<eos> Minister, please...<eos> So, here's what's going to happen.<eos> Either Saul Berenson gets returned to this embassy quickly and quietly, or we put Pakistan's $2 billion-a-year aid package under immediate review.<eos> Good day, Madam Ambassador.<eos> Who in God's name told you threats get you anywhere in this country?<eos> Money always talks.<eos> You don't have that kind of authority.<eos> But I do.
I won't let you.<eos> I thought leaving here would be music to your ears.<eos> Thought you hated Pakistan.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's starting to grow on me.<eos> You asleep?<eos> Hardly.<eos> You're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.<eos> I get why you did what you did, believe me.<eos> Oh, you do?
What made you change your mind?<eos> Well, I...<eos> I went out with Jeff and some of the other members of the crew to see a movie.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Uh, "Horrible Bosses 2."<eos> They said it was just like the first one. I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, but we went to Delancey's afterwards.<eos> And I'm not sure how the subject came up, exactly, but it turns out that Jeff thought I would be nuts to skip college this semester.<eos> - Did he? - Yeah.
For five years she didn't come home.<eos> Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.<eos> Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.<eos> Ah, don't go.<eos> Deedee, please.<eos> Why not?<eos> Ma doesn't want me here.<eos> Ma don't know what she wants.<eos> She wants you here.<eos> We all do.
No, BoJack, the show's about a horse, and I told those suits if they want my show, then that horse is gonna be BJ Goddamn Horseman.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - And they said, "No."<eos> - Oh.<eos> - And I said, "Please?"<eos> And they said, "Okay."<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> - Want to be my star?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Of course I do.
You have a lovely home.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You want to think of yourself as the good guy.<eos> Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not.<eos> In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts.<eos> That's you.<eos> That's BoJack Horseman.<eos> I don't know why I came here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do.
I'm your father.<eos> And you're coming home with me.<eos> Your mother's worried sick.<eos> EMMA: Your father?<eos> You have a family?<eos> I thought you were like me.<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> - (WIND HOWLING) You said you didn't have a clue where Sidney was.<eos> He was in your mirror the whole time?<eos> Maybe I did. So what?
I'm not trying to hurt you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Louisa, I'm not like everyone else.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> No...<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> Because you and me, we're... we're a lot alike.<eos> Listen, I know what it's like to feel alone and different.<eos> I do.
- Judging by your texts, you're pretty upset over a breakup with Allison Becks.<eos> My texts?<eos> How did you get my...<eos> What'd you do when Allison and Hayden came over last night?<eos> We hung out. Whoa! Whoa!<eos> Is this because her dad's, like, a politician or something?<eos> He send you guys here to scare me?<eos> This is us wanting answers.<eos> Well, don't you need, like, a warrant or something to get those...<eos> No, we don't.
How'd it go down there?<eos> You know what the problem is with everybody?<eos> They all just want to hear what they already believe.<eos> No one ever wants to hear the truth.<eos> I want to hear the truth.<eos> I don't know if you want to tell it, though.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Mr. Normal Childhood, Mr. Uneventful Father?<eos> Look, I can write you the standard empty-calorie celebrity tell-some, if that's what you're looking for, but I thought you might want more than that.<eos> I do.
No, you are.<eos> Well, tell your tongue that.<eos> Look, I wanna say... it to you.<eos> - Then why can't you? - Because I'm not a good person.<eos> I've done things, things that... made me think that I can't be your Prince Charming.<eos> - If you only knew, you'd...<eos> - I'd what? Punish you?<eos> Look, I've done tons of stupid I'm not proud of either.<eos> But if you really want to make this work...<eos> Oh, of course I do.
If you can wait on payment, I'll accept your offer.<eos> Fiona?<eos> This will do for you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Blithely?<eos> This light...<eos> The way you're standing, you look... you look like my stepmother must have when she was young.<eos> Does she, Thomas?<eos> When mother was a girl?<eos> No, she does not.
Please.<eos> Please?<eos> You.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Not yet, sweet.<eos> You ride it.<eos> Like it's a little pony.<eos> Dr. Blithely!<eos> I used to love dancing.<eos> Emily and I... Both of us did.
How do you feel?<eos> - Hungry.<eos> - Then you should eat.<eos> The last time I was offered food, it didn't turn out so well.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> It's all organic.<eos> This looks so damn good.<eos> You know, I know that resistance helped you to get out and that herr Meisner was instrumental - in the orchestration. - Uhhuh.<eos> So how did he know our people were waiting for you?<eos> He didn't.
I-I'm having trouble getting this zipper back up.<eos> I don't know what you're doing in there, young man, but you just bought yourself a tent.<eos> Hey, Bud. Vanessa.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Mike.<eos> I thought I'd stop by.<eos> Uh, I won't get to see you before I head out of town this weekend.<eos> Well, I am glad you're here.<eos> Um, Mike wants to talk to you about your trip to Reno.<eos> No, I don't.
Strange Empire 1x06 Electricity<eos> Ma!<eos> What is it?<eos> Bad.<eos> You have to come.<eos> Buck up, boy.<eos> Quit your mewling.<eos> He's going to fall.<eos> My baby! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't much like drinking alone.<eos> Nobody does, Captain.
NADINE: Ma'am, the White House called.<eos> You've been summoned to Camp David.<eos> Motorcade's waiting outside.<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> The leader of the free world trumps lunch?<eos> Sorry. (laughs)<eos> It's okay.<eos> You go to work.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> I did.
What exactly am I apologizing for?<eos> "For visiting the plant without investigating the scope and disparity of U.S. and Indian industrial standards."<eos> "Had I done so, I would have urged "both countries to raise their standards for the sake of all their citizens."<eos> - Bingo.<eos> - Sure.<eos> But Hepanza still gets to hide behind MIP standards.<eos> Aren't I just pulling India's pants down?<eos> They might not care if they can play your mea culpa<eos> - ad nauseam.<eos> - And if they do?
John?<eos> Say something, please.<eos> Wasn't your fault, mate.<eos> Should've never gotten you all involved.<eos> You, especially.<eos> Because I'm a coward.<eos> Because it's not your world.<eos> Never was and I knew it.<eos> And I knew you were high.<eos> We all did.
I will do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Fresh linens are on the cart.<eos> Watch out, the bed's pube city.<eos> God.<eos> You know, your son is a really great guy.<eos> Every night when I fall asleep on the sofa, he carries me to bed.<eos> Well, he tries to, and then he just drags me by the leg.<eos> You think I don't know my son is great?<eos> Of course I do.
(exhales) Sarah.<eos> - Sarah? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - "Love of your life" Sarah? - Yeah.<eos> Now it's all making sense.<eos> Well, no, it's not, actually, because she is dating someone else.<eos> So what's the occasion?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Which is why I'm meeting my chief romantic advisor right now in the bar.<eos> Oh, I wish I had a romantic advisor.<eos> You do.
I'm a brother.<eos> I know who Boss Nova is.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, can you tell him I'm busy.<eos> - He's a client of yours?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How come you never told me that?<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> Did he say what the problem was?<eos> No, but he never does.
What's the problem today?<eos> No problem.<eos> Just trying to get some work done.<eos> You don't know this, but a big part of my job is listening.<eos> You know, people like to tell you all kinds of crazy shit when they buy drugs; it makes them feel like it isn't just a purchase.<eos> Thank you, but... no thank you.<eos> You sure?<eos> I've got prime listening skills.<eos> You don't want to hear this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Last chance.<eos> Your hands are shaking.<eos> I knew.<eos> You don't have it in you.<eos> You've killed, but torture is different.<eos> For those with a conscience, inflicting pain is more difficult than inflicting death.<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You don't have the stomach for it.<eos> I do.
Starling General's at Eighth and Wilcott.<eos> HKPF IDed her as Sumilu Kang.<eos> She was a student at the University of Hong Kong.<eos> A biology textbook in her backpack.<eos> Apparently she was studying to become a veterinarian.<eos> He would have told me.<eos> I just needed more time.<eos> No, Mr. Queen, what you needed was conviction.<eos> And the men who do things like this have it.<eos> Tonight you didn't.
Look, we're both trying to find out who the hell's doing this.<eos> We could help each other.<eos> His name is Albert Mancini.<eos> No criminal record, aside from a few unpaid parking tickets.<eos> Grant says he doesn't know who this guy is.<eos> Oh, and now you believe him?<eos> I haven't decided yet!<eos> Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?<eos> Former, apparently.<eos> And no, I didn't.

We'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> Sure. About what?<eos> Muggings on the National Mall.<eos> Doubt I can help you.<eos> I got to get back to practice.<eos> Yeah, well... practice is gonna have to wait.<eos> Why do you want to talk to me?<eos> We've got a photograph of you fleeing a mugging near the Vietnam Memorial last Friday, wearing this backpack.<eos> You mind if we search it?<eos> Yeah... yeah, I do.
"It looks like lymphoma."<eos> But they can't be 100% sure.<eos> No.<eos> So, I go to the hospital tomorrow for surgery.<eos> They have to go into my lungs to obtain tissue for a biopsy.<eos> They'll-they'll do a bronchoscopy and a... thoracotomy.<eos> It's the only way to be definitive. Hmm.<eos> Surgeon didn't pull any punches.<eos> He asked me if I had my life in order.<eos> And do you?
It didn't sound that serious.<eos> When she didn't come in this morning or call, I phoned, but got no answer.<eos> It's strange because Courtney 's a very conscientious employee.<eos> It's not like her to be irresponsible.<eos> How long has she worked for you, Mr. Tolson?<eos> About six years.<eos> She joined us just after she got out of the Navy.<eos> Courtney's a systems analyst.<eos> With her military background, our clients love her.<eos> You do a lot of government work.
They get... toad.<eos> Yeah, well, let's... start the autopsy.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> You sure these were taken of him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I took 'em myself. Give me that.<eos> Oh... This gentleman has both his original central incisors.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Angus didn't.
Or to explain.<eos> What was there to explain?<eos> All passengers please board immediately.<eos> It was the hardest day of my life, choosing between the two men that I loved.<eos> I chose wrong.<eos> No. Maggie...<eos> Angus and I were wonderful friends but... a horrible couple.<eos> By the time I realized that, you were off to the war and... and I was committed to the role of a good wife.<eos> I thought you hated bow ties.<eos> I do.
Hi, grandpa.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> Let go.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> I like a girl.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do like a girl?
- No, no.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Oh. Just a little out of practice, I think.<eos> I hope my voice can fill the lounge.<eos> Well, you have your band.<eos> That's what they're for.<eos> I... don't actually have a band.<eos> I've mostly sung with backing tracks.<eos> Do you think I need one?<eos> Yes, yes, you do.
Well, not great.<eos> Considering I spent the night in jail.<eos> Why were you in jail? !<eos> She said you hit her?<eos> Yes, and I didn't.<eos> She just wants... leverage.<eos> More money in the divorce settlement.<eos> And just so you know, I would never lay a hand on her.<eos> And I can't even believe I have to say that.<eos> You don't.
You have to understand, when Jane looks at you, she just keeps remembering this sequence of events in her head... the pregnancy, the lying.<eos> How do I get that out of her head?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe with time?<eos> Is she still wearing her ring?<eos> Seriously, did you punch yourself?<eos> Rafael, stop.<eos> You and I both know what happened.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
No! You cannot use that water fountain!<eos> Why?<eos> No. Not for you.<eos> There's a perfectly good fountain right there.<eos> Wow, really-- the tiny water fountain?<eos> No, I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> You really got a problem with short people, huh?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Oh, yes, she does.
Lads!<eos> Get off of her!<eos> - Take your hands off me!<eos> - Mick O'Shea?<eos> You should have listened.<eos> We own the waterfront. _ Where are Mick and Tim O'Shea?<eos> - I've never seen them.<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> - If you have any idea where they are...<eos> - I don't.
Take a look.<eos> Anton said when the last words faded, the First of the Fallen would return to claim his prize.<eos> So, why try and break the deal, Jasmine?<eos> It wasn't my idea.<eos> Anton got back in touch.<eos> He told me he could trade my soul back for the acetate.<eos> Soul brokers never break a deal.<eos> They lose their right of parley with the underworld.<eos> Something here doesn't add up.<eos> So what did this, uh,
It was you.<eos> You were the one in my house that night.<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> Why?<eos> if you want to know that, you're gonna have to catch me.<eos> Not fast enough, Flash.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am, Barry.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> But you do, Barry.
But you know more than you've been telling me.<eos> They're called meta-humans.<eos> "Meta-humans"?<eos> People with very powerful abilities.<eos> You and me are the only guys on the force that know what's really going on.<eos> And we need to keep it that way... So nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And The Flash?<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yeah, I do.
This interview is taking place on Thursday 20th September 1991 at Rochdale police station.<eos> In the room are myself, Detective Sergeant Frankie Waddington.<eos> David Blake, solicitor.<eos> - Gary Sweeting. - Can't hear you, Gary.<eos> - Gary Sweeting.<eos> - Thank you, Gary. Do you want to tell us about what you did to Mandy?<eos> - I didn't do anything to Mandy.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - You killed her, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't.
- Where did you have sex?<eos> - On their living-room floor.<eos> We'd all been drinking.<eos> Gary had gone to bed.<eos> I don't think she was as squeaky-clean as she made out.<eos> I don't think I was the only one.<eos> She loved male attention.<eos> I know there was a young lad at work she was stringing along. Mick.<eos> Antony had to pick a date and hope that he'd get lucky.<eos> He didn't.
Miss Hughes, we haven't found any records of adoption for Jared.<eos> And you won't find any.<eos> Jared was dropped at my doorstep by a friend.<eos> She worked at a convent, a place where girls in trouble often went.<eos> So, you're saying that Jared's mother was one of these "girls in trouble"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know that Jared has a brother?<eos> A twin.<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
Please!<eos> Stop!<eos> Keri, Keri, hey, hey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'm Morgan.<eos> I'm a CSI.<eos> I got away.<eos> Yeah, you did.
But I learned my lessons.<eos> I'll be back, stronger and smarter than ever.<eos> Good luck with that, bro.<eos> Here I am riding around in a lovely truck, sharing an ice-cold beer with my new friends.<eos> My luck's already turned, right?<eos> Dude, anyone ever tell you, when you walk, you look just like a penguin?<eos> No.<eos> Nobody's ever told me that.<eos> He's saying he has a right to stop me from beating on a mope.<eos> Damn right I do.
My son would never leave his clothes.<eos> Oh, so elegant, he is.<eos> Yes, I-I show you.<eos> Damn.<eos> Mooney and the cops must have had him killed.<eos> Looks like the snitches get bumped.<eos> That's life.<eos> They're not going to get away with it, not as easy as they think.<eos> You take things too personally, you know what?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Previously on Ascension...<eos> Your father was convinced that the US could launch an interstellar spacecraft, right then in the '60s, with the technology we had.<eos> Quite a dream Dad had.<eos> Lorelei!<eos> Last night, we lost one of our own in a tragic accident, Lorelei Wright.<eos> And I don't have any experience with anything like this.<eos> Nobody does.
I did it to stay alive.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I know... you guys made a fortune.<eos> Give me half the money.<eos> Otherwise... I'll perform your story... every day in front of the Division office.<eos> Xiu... what fortune?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Sir Zhao.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Who doesn't in this town?
Terence Reynolds.<eos> He came 3 hours ago on his own.<eos> Said she's the victim's partner.<eos> He was ashamed.<eos> That's why I ended our relationship.<eos> Who else knew Douglas was gay?<eos> Nobody.<eos> He was scared to death people would find out.<eos> So he didn't have a social life?<eos> He did.
Are you surprised?<eos> ...paying tribute to Prime Minister Vlad Diacov.<eos> I'm getting married.<eos> I need you to respect that.<eos> And I respect you too much to respect that.<eos> You're too good for that guy.<eos> You've never even met him.<eos> His name is Win, for crying out loud.<eos> You really want to be the mother of Winthrop the Third?<eos> The fourth, actually, and, yes, I do.
Too late to try andpush it under the rug<eos> Sir, its already in Facebook,Email, Twitter, V-chat, I chat-<eos> Enough!<eos> They got the message<eos> - Lingaa? - Sir They've anyway come hereLet them do their duty and go<eos> If the previous reportis endorsed again it is to our advantage!<eos> MP sir, they aren't hereto inspect the dam<eos> But to place bombsto destroy the dam<eos> Who said so?<eos> You did
I plan to give it to you.<eos> Along with my full protection.<eos> We'll rebuild this newspaper together.<eos> How incredibly generous.<eos> You accept my offer, then?<eos> No. I reject it absolutely.<eos> But I would like to thank you.<eos> For days, I've been feeling useless, futile.<eos> I was losing the sense that my profession even mattered, that my newspaper mattered.<eos> But obviously it does.
That hurt?<eos> The ABCs of trauma are a handy tool for keeping a patient alive.<eos> But they're only a starting point.<eos> Hi?<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, hello.<eos> Um, I just rang the bell.<eos> No one answered.<eos> Um, they did say 8:00, right?<eos> They did, yeah.
Take junk for money, ~ pile it on the land.<eos> Money for nothing. ~ Could be.<eos> That looks like a green pickup to me.<eos> Mr Pritchard? Hello.<eos> Are you Mr Pritchard?<eos> ~ Detective Constable Scott.<eos> ~ Detective Constable Crowley.<eos> We're making enquiries about a man called Mike Greenholme.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> ~ No. ~ You don't?
Listen, you've killed my husband and you think you can come in here and poke around. Get lost!<eos> We have a warrant, Mrs Pritchard.<eos> Oh.<eos> We've started the search and boss, there's been a fire up here.<eos> You can still smell the smoke.<eos> I rang the fire brigade.<eos> They came out here last night to a burning caravan.<eos> The Pritchards didn't call them, a motorist did.<eos> ~ The area fire officer said he thought it was suspicious.<eos> ~ They always do.
H-has he been charged with anything?<eos> Because you turned our home upside down.<eos> I'd like to know exactly what you found.<eos> Mr. Bentley, this case is ongoing.<eos> But we can tell this... we found a pair of shoes in your garage that match the footprints from one of our crime scenes.<eos> Okay, well, this is ridiculous.<eos> We're gonna leave.<eos> We'll be back with a lawyer to get our son released.<eos> You all have no real evidence to charge him.<eos> Actually, we do.
It's been a blessing that he has battled for as long as he has.<eos> Heather's told me about the obstacles that you've had to overcome, Cam.<eos> And it's been a real inspiration to Johnny.<eos> He's such a brave kid.<eos> Well, we heard about his bravery.<eos> We can see it up close.<eos> I just wish he was awake to meet you guys.<eos> You would love Johnny. I mean, everybody did.<eos> I can't believe I just said that.<eos> Everybody does.
This is an advance.<eos> You deposit it, we have a deal.<eos> You don't, we don't.<eos> I look forward to my bank balance being 10 million lighter.<eos> Get me to the nearest bank!<eos> Hey, hey, we still got Nike next week.<eos> No, we got $10 million today.<eos> If the money is here now, it will still be here in seven days.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Oh, that's nice. Okay, let me get that for you here.<eos> Hey, did you talk to Cliff?<eos> Everyone's really freaked out that we're gonna lose the practice.<eos> Morgan's been going up to the roof a lot.<eos> I did talk to Cliff, and the great news is that he said he would help me with my taxes.<eos> Nice. There's a small catch.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cliff was still very upset that I cheated on him with you.<eos> Right. So I told him that we were broken up.<eos> You did what?
Three days behind bars... that doesn't give you much material.<eos> No gang rape?<eos> No.<eos> Strangely enough, not.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> 'Cause that would've been a turn-on.<eos> Is that baby lotion?<eos> It's not enough to show that the codes are similar.<eos> To prove economic espionage, they need to show that you knew the Chinese company was going to give it to the government. - Good.<eos> Because I didn't.
Everybody there talks about God.<eos> Like he's some Uncle hiding in the attic.<eos> Drives you crazy.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Yeah, but even I don't like talking about it.<eos> I don't like pretending to be someone I'm not when I'm being interviewed. Really?<eos> You're good at it.<eos> Your Honor, it was one quarter of a mile outside of Illinois.<eos> It doesn't matter if it was one mile or a hundred miles.<eos> Yes, it does.
This will all blow over when the next, bigger story knocks it off the front page.<eos> I'm sure there's some celebrity who's about to go into rehab.<eos> Watch.<eos> Where's Entertainment Tonight at?<eos> It may seem like a scene from the newest Taken sequel, but even Liam Neeson couldn't save this little girl. I have to warn you, this clip is rated "R" for "Really, Nathan Miller?"<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Tony Kornheiser with you, and there's a lot of hoo-ha going on about local newscaster Nathan Miller.<eos> So let's go to the phones.<eos> Bill in Arlington.<eos> Yeah, how you doing, Tony?
Conspiracy, POJ, Rico, the works.<eos> Well, that's a... that's a hell of a plan.<eos> You sit down with a panel of chimpanzees and a bucket of crack and come up with that one?<eos> I figure whatever else happens, we'll stir things up.<eos> We might even make the papers.<eos> Oh, yeah, we're gonna make the papers, all right. We're gonna be dead in the streets in time for the evening edition.<eos> Well, at least the people will know the truth.<eos> And we'll go out doing our jobs, enforcing the law.<eos> That's the best inspirational speech you got?<eos> Doing our jobs?
How about you, Harvey?<eos> Fine by me.<eos> - Oh, God. - I envy you boys.<eos> Having nothing to lose must be liberating.<eos> Must feel pretty good.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Suppose you did have something to lose.<eos> What would you do then? Suppose, for instance, I had a knife to Barbara Kean's throat right now.<eos> Would you still be so brave?<eos> You don't.
I'm really sorry about that.<eos> And we're both deeply sorry for your loss, both of you.<eos> So... what are you gonna do with that thing?<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'm gonna put it in a locker for a couple of months and... accidentally forget about it and then I'm gonna give it to the New York D.A.<eos> Ah. That's very nice, I think.<eos> You know, Leonard never has to deal with it.<eos> You know what, man, you were right.<eos> My aunt deserves to be happy.<eos> She does.
I'm not.<eos> I'm saying that...<eos> Paulie G. wrote about that time in his life.<eos> What about how women are depicted in other shows?<eos> - From "Entourage," to...<eos> - Please don't start this again.<eos> You just said it's Paulie's version of that time in his life.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did Paulie have that much sex?<eos> Well, does anyone?
What... what is happening?<eos> We're back in D.C. we're not standing in the sun anymore.<eos> I'm not gonna live in your apartment, waiting to service you.<eos> I have things to do.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> But...<eos> - I did book a nice hotel suite for booty calls.<eos> - Okay, no.<eos> See, we have to have a conversation about...<eos> I don't do booty calls, Jake.
Just trying to lighten the mood in here, Jim.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Next question. Come on, Abby.<eos> Don't dodge me.<eos> These are serious questions.<eos> She could shut this whole thing down with something like<eos> "just because a private moment has been made public doesn't give us the right to pass judgment."<eos> Don't tell me how to run my people.<eos> Just tell me I don't have to worry about the Elliots.<eos> Oh, you do.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Liv's back from New Mexico with the Elliots.<eos> Apparently, they're awful.<eos> Just horrible, awful people who hate each other.<eos> That's what the problem is.<eos> So Liv's putting them in adjoining rooms at the Hay-Adams, and she's doing their press for them, and she asked us to babysit.<eos> Because working together is what we do best.<eos> Look, you don't have to treat me like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
[Gasps] Hey, I'm done with my synopsis.<eos> You want it?<eos> Oh, I'm sure it's great.<eos> Just distribute it.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> [Scoffs] I ca... I can't believe it... my 50-year plan shattered by sports.<eos> What's the obsession?<eos> I mean, it... it... it isn't like theater... it doesn't have any real meaning.<eos> Of course it does.
Starting, most obviously, with the parents of children who died?<eos> Well, there's a list in there.<eos> But aside from them-- no, not yet.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, I heard you had a knack for missing persons.<eos> You know, I've never been to London.<eos> Hear it's a lot like New York.<eos> I guess you guys don't get the same number of gun deaths over there as we do, huh?<eos> Not many countries do.
Then what is she?<eos> What have you gotten Captain Gregson into?<eos> This chance encounter between Miss White and Openshaw.<eos> It casts her withholding of Fordham's surveillance in a new light, does it not?<eos> Yes, I guess it does.<eos> It's likely her concern had more to do with protecting herself than Fordham's other clients.<eos> I think I know who we should ask why.<eos> Agent Boden, you were in charge of the surveillance unit tailing Fordham.<eos> If you knew he was in contact with Openshaw, if you knew Openshaw had crossed paths with Ms. White...<eos> I didn't.
That's right, why?<eos> That's where he's going.<eos> Call Kono.<eos> We got to know exactly where that accident happened.<eos> We find them, we find Sophie.<eos> That little girl you took, she's not my daughter.<eos> I know. My brother-in-law grabbed the wrong girl, but it didn't matter.<eos> I knew as soon you heard 1.6 million, you'd do whatever I said before you'd admit to killing my daughter.<eos> You have to believe me, I never meant for that to happen.<eos> But it did.
- That was our deal.<eos> You know, I'm surprised you're kicking me out.<eos> You're letting Audrey go.<eos> Audrey is gone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> I wasn't gonna leave Haven anyway.<eos> William and I still have work to do.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
Ma'am... let's do this.<eos> Let me call you later.<eos> No.<eos> I said I will call again.<eos> Yes, bye for now.<eos> No one's stopping you here.<eos> Please let us work, we're busy.<eos> Quiet or I give you hard time!<eos> You're full of crap!<eos> Doing work?
It must be pretty chaotic up there 'cause it's your students, isn't it?<eos> How are the other kids?<eos> They must be feeling it.<eos> Such a small class.<eos> Must've hit 'em pretty hard.<eos> You're what, an internet newspaper?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're not really different from the traditional print media.<eos> I have his phone. Clarence's.<eos> You do?
Who's the kid?<eos> Mark's nephew.<eos> Here, doing computer science.<eos> He's gonna check the file credentials for me, which I'm presuming you brought along.<eos> Andy?<eos> Ah, yes, I have a gun.<eos> You speak Urdu?<eos> - He says it's incomplete. - (Laughs)<eos> - You know, things didn't quite go to plan.<eos> - I do.
- I do get it.<eos> - Do you get it, Jake?<eos> Because they all died.<eos> Okay, Kevin, I'm so sorry.<eos> I see your point, and I will talk to Kevin.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That would be great.<eos> For a minute there, I felt like I didn't know who you were.<eos> And now I do.
You, uh, having some trouble with your differential?<eos> Yes, I am, actually.<eos> I just put new gaskets and seals in, but she's still running rough.<eos> Try new bearings and thrust washers, that should fix it.<eos> You know something about cars?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I know a few things about this car, though.<eos> Actually, I rode in it a couple of times.<eos> Your dad loved to talk about this car.<eos> Yeah, he certainly did.

Rediscover me.<eos> That sounds great. Can I come?<eos> Do you think I'm too controlling?<eos> Do you think I'm too controlling?<eos> Well, you do make me staple everything on a diagonal two centimeters from the top left...<eos> It gives the strongest hold.<eos> And you did put a password on our DVR player because<eos> - I don't know how to manage Sunday nights.<eos> - How to manage Sunday nights.<eos> You don't.
Right, let's have a look at the last three guys you dated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Notice the sweaters? Huh? See that?<eos> Well, you have to admit...<eos> A shawl collar looks good on everyone.<eos> Not my point, but, yeah.<eos> Stu: I told him to make mine super-, super-spicy, 'cause you know I can handle it, but I told him to make yours extra-, extra-mild so that you don't get an upset stomach like you get sometimes.<eos> Okay.<eos> - We got your "Wall Street" ready to go.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Ah, the Russian torrent sites have it now.<eos> I don't think you understand how sharing works.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why did you tell Zelda about Geronimo?<eos> What?<eos> You told Zelda.<eos> Zelda told Stephie.<eos> Now Stephie's using it to pretend to be some kind of psychic at me.<eos> I don't know what a Geronimo is.<eos> He didn't.
! Who told her to take the A.C.T. a second time? Was that your idea?<eos> You take your low score, a-and you live with it.<eos> That's what we did, and we turned out okay.<eos> You know, this is really our fault.<eos> Always encouraging her, telling her she can do anything.<eos> We just got to be honest with her, Frankie.<eos> She's talking about all these private and out-of-state schools.<eos> She's go to know that's probably not going to happen.<eos> Well, we don't know.<eos> Pretty sure we do.
The ones that decide your fate?<eos> Well, they're not some magical group of woodland fairies, all right?<eos> They actually exist.<eos> And they're all around you, watching your every move.<eos> Okay. Creepy.<eos> Noted.<eos> People who get on the U.N.O.S. list are not just people who need the organ.<eos> It's people who the board feels will take care of the organ.<eos> Do you know who's on this board?<eos> I do, indeed, yeah.
The insurance company is advising Charlie be moved to a facility.<eos> His mom thinks maybe they're right.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> That's like giving up.<eos> It's not giving up.<eos> It's a perfectly good facility.<eos> - Where he'd be all alone. - [Sighs]<eos> I'm not sure that matters to Charlie.<eos> It does to us, but...
I think basically put two variations of a similar sauce, but not the same sauce.<eos> We're still making two separate...<eos> If you're doing vegetables and fish, I'm doing protein and meat, we're not marrying the dishes together.<eos> He is not listening to what I'm trying to tell him.<eos> These proteins don't go together.<eos> You need something to balance each other out.<eos> It's the whole idea of this.<eos> We have to marry it together.<eos> I think we're over-thinking that.<eos> No, I don't.
Maybe you should take a day off.<eos> Would if I could.<eos> Our victim, Justin Murray, moved to Portland from New York seven years ago.<eos> Huh. Arrest for vandalism.<eos> Other than that, he's clean.<eos> No gang affiliations, no known enemies.<eos> So we believe the witness, Mr. Fierros?<eos> We're dealing with a chupacabra?<eos> Do we know what a chupacabra is?<eos> No, we don't.
- We're on our way.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The Secundum Naturae Ordinem Wesen are back, and Monroe is not happy.<eos> Diego?<eos> Did you fall?<eos> Diego? Aah! Ah!<eos> I didn't touch it. I didn't think you'd want me to.<eos> We're gonna need it as evidence.<eos> - When did you find it?<eos> - I didn't.

There's a lot more than just me.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> She wasn't looking for a blonde.<eos> She was looking for the savior.<eos> What?<eos> This scroll... the writing is runic.<eos> It's a prophecy.<eos> It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."<eos> She knew?<eos> Before you even did.
And snow.<eos> My, my. How intriguing.<eos> And such a rare gift.<eos> Why would you ever want to give it up?<eos> Perhaps I could interest you in lessons instead?<eos> No.<eos> I want to stop them.<eos> We heard that you were the greatest collector Of magic in all the land.<eos> You must have something that can help.<eos> Well, of course I do, dearie.
A mysterious flower That blooms only for those who are willing to wait.<eos> I don't believe we've had the pleasure.<eos> Ingrid.<eos> You must be here for Helga.<eos> I'll go and fetch her for you.<eos> Yeah, I-I'd heard rumors of this mysterious third sister, But I had to see her for myself.<eos> The stories did not lie.<eos> You are more beautiful and intriguing Than I could have ever imagined.<eos> Did I say that out loud?<eos> [ laughs ] Of course I did.
It's all right here.<eos> FBI tends to be pretty thorough.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just... It's a gut instinct, Nolan. I can't explain it.<eos> Well, maybe his interview tonight will.<eos> If he's hiding something from the FBI, he's not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television.<eos> Ems, I respect your instinct, but I think you're looking for an easier answer.<eos> 'Cause the truth is anything but.<eos> It's hard to accept that this happened to someone that we love.<eos> But it did.
Well, I was at a job interview.<eos> You already have a job...<eos> As a waitress in Fresno.<eos> Pretty tough commute to L.A., huh?<eos> Mom, you don't have to...<eos> Look, when you get out, we'll have an apartment, I'll have a great job, and this whole ordeal will just be a blip on our radar.<eos> And what if I never get out?<eos> - You will.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Seriously?<eos> That's incredible.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> "Novel immunohistochemistry: Techniques in cancer diagnos..."<eos> What is this, some casual afternoon reading?<eos> Nurse Jackson gave these to me to get caught up on Jordi's condition.<eos> That's not getting caught up.<eos> That's what I read in my third year of oncology residency.<eos> No kidding. I didn't know I had to go to medical school to be a mother.<eos> You don't.
Yup, and if we're lucky, who he bought it from.<eos> After finding the cocaine,<eos> Cam reexamined Toby's nasal septum and discovered perforation.<eos> You're telling me he had a hole in his nose because of the cocaine?<eos> The degree of damage suggests that he'd been using heavily for a while.<eos> Wall Street and cocaine, right?<eos> Now you can understand my suspicion.<eos> Booth, capitalism requires...<eos> Ah. I'm not the only one who hates the business.<eos> Aubrey does, too.
I get it, I get it, huh?<eos> None of these sons of bitches had your back when it mattered, but where was I?<eos> I was there, remember?<eos> With Falcone, the mayor, blaze of glory?<eos> Be nice, for my sake.<eos> - I am being nice.<eos> - Haven't you learned your lesson?<eos> We're only alive because Falcone let us live.<eos> You got to go along to get along, Jim.<eos> No, I don't.
Helo's ready, sir.<eos> Copy that.<eos> O'Rourke's medevac left.<eos> He's en route to Norfolk.<eos> Hour's up.<eos> Time to contact Aranda.<eos> So, what are you gonna say to him when he asks for his money?<eos> Well, Tony, I'm gonna ask him his preference in powerboats.<eos> Did you know there are 17 distinct categories of fast boats?<eos> I did not.
Why would you assume I had bad dates?<eos> I am a catch!<eos> There she is!<eos> The girl with the... attributes that Angus loves.<eos> Forget about Evie.<eos> Angus stood up and promised to love you for ever.<eos> Why didn't he tell me about her?<eos> Because he knew you'd worry about it.<eos> Because he knows what you're like and he loves you for it.<eos> He does, doesn't he?

I'm gonna grab a coffee.<eos> Ca-caw! Is it going down?<eos> It's going down.<eos> But whether or not Henry would notice the cute barista who was covering for Romy<eos> - remained to be seen.<eos> - He's next!<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Ooh, it is taking every ounce of self-control I have not to block this.<eos> It's like I want people to be happy.<eos> But on the other hand, no, I don't.
Yes, but at the end of the day, you go home to your beautiful wife, whereas Henry goes home to a salad, usually.<eos> You can't make love to a salad.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> Oh, find out who his favorite "FRIEND" is.<eos> And if he ever had the clap.<eos> Oh, sorry, sir.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, please, join me.<eos> Thought you had a private bathroom<eos> - in your office.<eos> - Oh, I do.

How do you...<eos> I'm sorry... I'm still trying to process the fact that you were married to him.<eos> And now you want to put our lives in the hands of this lunatic?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I can't help you in Philadelphia.<eos> We've made up our mind.<eos> You know I would stop at nothing to protect you.<eos> We don't need your protection.<eos> Yes, you do.
He lied to you, manipulated you.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Pull the trigger, Duncan.<eos> It's what you came to do.<eos> You're all part of my experiment.<eos> Read my research!<eos> We can save them!<eos> Duncan, listen to me. He's making you believe that you don't have a choice!<eos> Do you think that I want to die?<eos> I don't.
Guess the price was right, huh?<eos> Like I said, we haven't had a chance to talk about fees.<eos> Of course you haven't.<eos> Well, good luck, honey.<eos> She's gonna need it with those over-priced cow ponies.<eos> Okay, so... even if I cross out everyone I don't actually like, I still come up with thirty people.<eos> Yeah, and that's a gala for Jack.<eos> I know, I know. So...<eos> Oh, grandpa, how did Val take the news?<eos> Well, she didn't.
Scott didn't even tell me it was in the works.<eos> Doesn't seem like him.<eos> My day went kinda sideways as well.<eos> New client horse?<eos> New truck, actually.<eos> Ahmed had it delivered...<eos> for work.<eos> I was shocked too, but...<eos> It kinda makes sense.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I know you guys forced me to come here so I can watch Alex and get all inspired by college again.<eos> We really didn't.<eos> Yeah, you just got in the car.<eos> I only packed four sandwiches.<eos> Happy anniversary, Jay!<eos> I don't love this tableau.<eos> Is that Gloria's gift to me?<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
I have to push it.<eos> It's all I can think of.<eos> Just let him push it.<eos> Who cares?<eos> No one is touching this button!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> This is a test of character to see if we're the kind of people with self-control or the kind who just grab at any piece of cheese that's put in front of them.<eos> Don't you want to know what it does?<eos> "Want to know what it does"?<eos> Of course I do.
JAM IE: It's like you... you say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away!<eos> It's kind of like telling everyone to go fuck themselves.<eos> Okay, let's watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.<eos> Why were you doing this party, Stan?<eos> Was it because you made people mad at school or because you just wanted to be a big shot?<eos> I... We... We wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but...<eos> So then in a time when people really need to come together, you cancel on him?<eos> I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.<eos> That is correct.<eos> Yes, I do.
He's not into his grades, and he's always goofing around, and he's not serious.<eos> There's something not quite right about him.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> I can.<eos> Bipolar, emotional disorder, mommy issues.<eos> Shall I go on?<eos> Says last night, you claimed he harassed you by phone, followed you to class, incited arguments.<eos> The dude broke into our house.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
You're gonna need to find something fast.<eos> I got to run.<eos> It's Halloween.<eos> I got a kid.<eos> I'll be on cell.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Happy Halloween.<eos> Louis Atwood says that you entered his house without a warrant.<eos> I had probable cause.<eos> Of course you did.
Why would he do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It could explain the song, a nostalgic ploy.<eos> It's so cliched.<eos> I told you. We love our cliches here.<eos> They even come with a soundtrack.<eos> But Roberta Flack?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your life has a soundtrack, Ben.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You sleeping with her?<eos> Is that any of your business?<eos> Well, she's a wealthy older woman.<eos> She funds your work.<eos> She put on your first show.<eos> Maybe when the money and the favors dried up, you decided to make her pay.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a video of you assaulting her in a parking garage.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm gonna untie you now, and then you're gonna stand up and walk towards me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> It'll all be over in a moment.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Kenneth's in jail.<eos> I'll kill her.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
So would it be bad if I told you that I think you're hot?<eos> Shut your gross, beautiful face.<eos> No, I'd love it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Matt.<eos> - I'm Jessica.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Mm. Hey, you, uh, you want to maybe... go out some time?<eos> Yes, I do.
Of mine.<eos> What? !<eos> I'm saying that we should all celebrate our flaws!<eos> Together! I'm saying that...<eos> The one day I wear jeans. I'm saying, look. We're exactly the same.<eos> I'm sorry, what-what am I looking at?<eos> This monstrosity the doctors call a knee that I didn't know was a problem till, like, three days ago.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> He did!
Yet.<eos> Look... you gonna throw me off this case again?<eos> No.<eos> You do what you have to.<eos> You don't even need to send me reports.<eos> And I'm sorry about Sweets.<eos> I wish to hell I could turn back the clock.<eos> Wow, no reports.<eos> Never heard of that happening.<eos> It doesn't.
So, to Durant, the files are his scriptures.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're saying that the-the files are still in the FBI?<eos> There's no way they'd be secure here for 20 years.<eos> It's not the institution that is holy.<eos> It is the man.<eos> It's J. Edgar Hoover.<eos> Hoover's office.<eos> Wait, Hoover's office doesn't even exist anymore.<eos> Yes, it does.
Michael's been On all these covers of magazines<eos> And we haven't been, And bill goes, "man, if i wanted to be On the cover of a magazine,<eos> I wouldn't be a drummer." - i would say as a band We've certainly Attained a great deal,<eos> And things that we never thought Would happen have happened,<eos> And i would say that we're At a real crossroads right now In a lot of different ways.<eos> All of them I would say are very positive, And, you know, It's just a pop band At the end of the day.<eos> It's just a rock show After all.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I have a real knee-jerk side To me about many big things, And--but i don't--i don't think That that applies To, you know, my band at all.<eos> I really don't.
When J.L. worked here, was there anyone she rejected or someone who had a crush on her?<eos> She's a beautiful girl.<eos> Well, you remember anyone who looked like this, a customer maybe?<eos> You know, that looks like this busboy we had.<eos> Guy was kinda off.<eos> O.C.D., I think.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> No one got the grill as clean as he did.<eos> Broke my heart to fire him.<eos> Anything to do with J.L.?
I know.<eos> I know that.<eos> I can see that in you now.<eos> Now that...<eos> I'm a woman.<eos> And I wish we weren't here right now.<eos> Yeah, I wish we'd met someplace else.<eos> I just don't want this to sound wrong, Holden, but...<eos> I think you're superb.<eos> I really do.
They live to cause pain.<eos> My father ran away for all of us.<eos> Don't add up. Brujeria wielded a magic the world hasn't seen since God turned on the lights.<eos> He struck them down.<eos> Not even hell would give them asylum.<eos> They were annihilated.<eos> You don't believe her?<eos> I can't believe them.<eos> I don't have a spell to shut down the Brujeria, Anne Marie.<eos> Nobody does.
Hell and earth will become one.<eos> No more hiding like cowards in the shadows.<eos> We'll live in the open, and you'll be the ones hiding.<eos> But there'll be no hiding from us.<eos> You'll be ours.<eos> So that's what's on the way.<eos> Ambitious.<eos> Too bad you won't see it.<eos> You don't have the power to stop me.<eos> No man does.
Says here he was busted out by four gunmen?<eos> Yeah, which is odd...<eos> Hargrove never used accomplices.<eos> All right, so who did Hargrove spend time with at Blackgate?<eos> Who did he communicate with on the outside?<eos> His entire stretch, he was isolated from gen pop.<eos> Never made or received phone calls.<eos> Only one visitor in those two years... his brother John.<eos> - Got an address?<eos> - We do.
- I don't know.<eos> It's a ploy.<eos> She wants you to set a date.<eos> It's a standard move.<eos> She'll be back.<eos> Do you play video games?<eos> Ed, don't ever do that again.<eos> My apologies, Detective.<eos> Do either of you play video games?<eos> I do, I...
I can't feel my legs.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Roy, it's possible that the blood to your spine has been cut off by the graft, but I'm gonna do everything I can to fix it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Please do.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm gonna give you something to let you sleep.<eos> Start with trying to induce hypertension.<eos> Did you get Maggie Pierce's e-mail?<eos> I did, yes.
You meant it.<eos> It was in the heat of the moment.<eos> I just...<eos> You know, you wanted to hurt me, and you did that, so at least have the guts to stand by it.<eos> Will you just hear me out?<eos> You could do worse than compare me to a brilliant surgeon, but you meant it in the sense that I am cold and ambitious and selfish, a horrible wife and mother.<eos> I got that.<eos> Well, I love how you just switch it around so you can make it fit...<eos> You think I sound like my mother?<eos> You do.
Go get 'em, coach.<eos> You too.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'd already had cam's clogged ears, My dad's bronchitis, And then there it was, right on schedule...<eos> Even I have my limits.<eos> Call dad.<eos> Siri: Paul Rudd is an American film and television actor.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Call... Dad! Hey, honey.<eos> How you doing?
Maybe, but do you think she's gonna help us?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna go with Audrey.<eos> See you later.<eos> When's my phone call?<eos> I want to speak to my new twin sis.<eos> I see the confusion.<eos> You think you have rights.<eos> How do I put this politely?<eos> You don't.
And you ain't just done it the once, have you?<eos> I mean, you've done it again ..and again... ..and again.<eos> So, get out.<eos> I can't walk all the way to school.<eos> I barely made it down the stairs this morning.<eos> ~ Out!<eos> ~ Ah.<eos> ~ This is about me and your mum, innit?<eos> ~ Don't.<eos> Seriously, just... ..don't.
And somehow we drifted apart. Somehow?<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> This is not my world.<eos> I need to get back home.<eos> How do you intend to do that?<eos> By helping this world's Beckett find that artifact so I can get back to my reality.<eos> This is why I live with mom.<eos> So you're a fan.<eos> And here I thought you didn't know me.<eos> Yeah, I don't.
I mean, I eat with her, I sleep with her... but I know you are not her.<eos> You know, none of this explains how you know so much about the crime scene.<eos> I have a police scanner, and I was tracking the investigation.<eos> Actually, that's why I'm here, captain.<eos> I know what was in the briefcase,<eos> I know where it's going,<eos> - and I think I know who took it.<eos> - And how do you know all that?<eos> It's complicated, but...<eos> I do.
K-keep... post... keep... keep... keep us po... thank you.<eos> Thank you, Ryan.<eos> Eyes back in their sockets, cowboy.<eos> - We got a murder to solve.<eos> - Right.<eos> Now, who is this Clyde fellow, and why did our victim have his letter?<eos> And what does any of this have to do with the Peacock boys?<eos> Good questions.<eos> And I know who has the answers.<eos> You do?
But if you're interested, there might be something you could do to make it up to them.<eos> Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too, but, uh, it couldn't be helped.<eos> Hey, there, cowboy.<eos> Where you off to in such a hurry?<eos> Beckett, what are you doing?<eos> We're gonna miss our flight.<eos> You got to be in the office by morning.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
You're totally gonna win that contest.<eos> She's not gonna win that contest.<eos> She lacks that critical skill of being ahead of her opponent.<eos> in a word, anticipation. Aah! - Would you stop doing that?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Listen, I don't know if it's important, but there was a big guy over there that dropped something in the dumpster and then took something out.<eos> Oh, no, we missed the drop.<eos> Anyway, wish me luck.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately it looks like Elka's gonna have to forfeit because she does not have a partner.<eos> Yes, she does.
And if I'm being truthful and honest... I still want to be with you.<eos> I want us to tell everyone what happened and just... Run away together.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> It's over.<eos> For real, this time. (Long sigh) Ah...<eos> I had a feeling you might say that.<eos> Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us.<eos> - What? - My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies.<eos> Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.<eos> - No, he really does.
Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady.<eos> It would be a shame if someone was...<eos> having fun at her expense.<eos> - Randy, whose are these?<eos> - I don't know. Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans!<eos> In my jeans?<eos> Randy, do you have something to tell me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm up for parole in three years, miss Pope.<eos> Which is why I'd understand if you want to drop this.<eos> Because if we lose this, we're not just talking about more time in prison.<eos> The Attorney General will go for the death penalty.<eos> You know...<eos> I read this thing in the paper a couple of years ago.<eos> Some lawyer type said - that the truth is like the sun.<eos> You can shut it out for a while, but it's not gonna go away.<eos> You believe in that, don't you, miss Pope?<eos> I do.
You believe in that, don't you, miss Pope?<eos> I do.<eos> I want the truth to come out.<eos> Then I better get to work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, both.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just trying to remember who said it...<eos> That thing about the truth and the sun.<eos> I did.
Don't be swayed by anyone.<eos> She wants to see him.<eos> So?<eos> Let her see him.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I'm not going to let Olivia see Jake Ballard.<eos> Why not?<eos> Do you believe that Jake Ballard killed your son?<eos> Of course I do.
It's okay.<eos> Ms. Boykin, do you still work for...<eos> Azo Charter?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> So, you were...<eos> I was...?<eos> You...<eos> Do you have a question, Ms. Tascioni?<eos> Do I?<eos> Yes, I do.
Right.<eos> So... I have given it a lot of thought, and I can't ask you to endorse me.<eos> Alicia, I already decided. No.<eos> It hurts you with Castro.<eos> And I'm fine with that. Maybe I'll ask you later, but I am cancelling you for Monday.<eos> What's going on, Alicia?<eos> I just... I'm asking too much of you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Do you not want me to endorse you?<eos> No, I do.
Do svidaniya, Boris.<eos> So, this is a question of first impression.<eos> Is cultural relativism a bar to a claim of sexual discrimination, or is it tantamount to an admission that should end these... proceedings?<eos> Miss Tascioni, is there a problem? What?<eos> No, Judge.<eos> I'm being stalked. - Excuse me?<eos> That man in the gallery over there,<eos> Josh Perotti... he's a stalker.<eos> Sir, if you don't have any business in my courtroom...<eos> Actually, Your Honor, I do.
So...<eos> Hey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Uh, I... I totally understand how you're feeling.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Does, uh, teaching scare the crap out of you, Jess?<eos> Well, it is my life's calling,<eos> - so, no.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You don't get it.<eos> - I do.
You're damn right.<eos> Take me to them.<eos> Um, do you want to, like, go find a bar, grab a drink?<eos> There's a bar that I like.<eos> It's called... my place.<eos> Great. Uh, is it... You think it'll be crowded?<eos> You know I'm talking about my house, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, no, I wasn't... I thought that was just<eos> - a clever name but now I do.
Just date him.<eos> It's a dumb rule.<eos> - It's against the rules.<eos> - Take the hat.<eos> - Oh. - Now, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.<eos> And no date leaves until everyone is laid.<eos> I just want to meet a nice fella.<eos> Can I have permission to send them home<eos> - without sex?<eos> - No, you do not.
- Kai is not homeless.<eos> - Nick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?<eos> She... she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.<eos> She always dresses in layers, tons of layers.<eos> She's not homeless.<eos> Her grandfather is Tran.<eos> - And where does he hang out?<eos> - A park bench.<eos> I think you're having a nervous breakdown.<eos> I really do.
Over here now!<eos> Oi, Michael!<eos> But I need the toilet, sir.<eos> It's not my fault I'm late.<eos> I had to see to me Nana.<eos> I'll see to your bleeding Nana in a minute.<eos> Do you think I do these classes for the good of me health?<eos> It's half 11:00, for Christ's sake.<eos> Anyone would think you didn't like boxing.<eos> - I don't.
Shine<eos> Give 'em the old razzle dazzle<eos> And shine<eos> Give 'em the old razzle dazzle<eos> And shine<eos> And shine<eos> And shine<eos> 50p's.<eos> Oi, you owe me 50p.<eos> - No, I don't.
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle<eos> And shine<eos> Give 'em the old razzle dazzle<eos> And shine<eos> And shine<eos> And shine<eos> 50p's.<eos> Oi, you owe me 50p.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Christ, Billy, they're dropping like flies.<eos> For Christ's sake.<eos> - I've got you a pasty.<eos> - Really?<eos> From the Co-op.<eos> Just don't tell Dad I was late or anything.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Oh, come off it.<eos> Do you really not remember about Granddad?<eos> Of course I do.
In this video...<eos> And in the dozen that you made after that, you were thrown around, slapped, verbally degraded, and penetrated by two men while screaming and saying, "no."<eos> That was acting.<eos> And in this video, you were also thrown around, slapped, verbally degraded, and penetrated by two men while screaming and saying, "no."<eos> Isn't that correct?<eos> Yes, but I never said...<eos> So the main objective difference is, in the 13 adult videos you were paid, but in this one, you weren't.<eos> No, I did not want to be raped.<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You did, in all 14 videos.
I can't believe I was married to a guy that has a Calvin and Hobbes tramp stamp.<eos> This is fun!<eos> - I had a lot of fun.<eos> - Lot of fun last night.<eos> - So crazy!<eos> - It's like old times.<eos> It is like old times.<eos> I mean, we were just so, like...<eos> We didn't have a care in the world.<eos> - No, we didn't.
Well, what did he say?<eos> Well, he didn't say anything to me, okay?<eos> We didn't talk about it.<eos> I mean, that's why I don't wanna have a relationship because then you have to do things like have discussions about the relationship...<eos> it's like a vicious cycle.<eos> Okay, all right, listen, you have got to talk to him, so you can find out if you guys even want different things...<eos> - Same things.<eos> - Same things.<eos> - Eh. - I know you like him.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Welcome to prison.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> You just tell me how you hacked into NASA, and I promise everything will be okay.<eos> Should Happy and Paige be here?<eos> They're talking to you.<eos> Sergey Antonovich and Roman Volkovsky's cell.<eos> Russian outfit.<eos> Both doing a dime for identity theft.<eos> Well, clearly scumbags, but they don't seem to have the technical acumen to break out of this place.<eos> This one does.
They're talking to you.<eos> Sergey Antonovich and Roman Volkovsky's cell.<eos> Russian outfit.<eos> Both doing a dime for identity theft.<eos> Well, clearly scumbags, but they don't seem to have the technical acumen to break out of this place.<eos> This one does.<eos> Here, let me look.<eos> Percy Tate.<eos> You know the guy?<eos> Everybody does;
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything-- violent crimes involving ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.
- Yes, well, luckily, nobody's<eos> - watched the video, of course.<eos> - No.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Nope.<eos> But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular.<eos> I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damn hairy.<eos> Oh. Oh. God, I'm sorry, Laura.<eos> You know I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right?<eos> Nothing to do with you... personally.
Stop yelling.<eos> Connor, you don't need a lawyer.<eos> You're innocent.<eos> You believe me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> But we need your help to find the real killer, and you know him.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> You do.
Becks!<eos> Becks!<eos> ~ Who the hell is she?<eos> ~ Just someone from the club.<eos> Just someone from the club who you hold hands with?<eos> We weren't holding hands.<eos> She was holding my hand for moral support.<eos> ~ How old is she?<eos> ~ I don't know.<eos> ~ Yes, you do. ~ 23.
Does it have a swimming pool?<eos> Hmm, I'm not sure.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Yeah, hello?<eos> I can't do it, mate, I'm taking Mags and her mum to Bingo.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> I changed my shift especially.<eos> Well, why can't her new bloke take them?<eos> She uses you.<eos> She bloody does.
Like she was holding your hand the other night in the pub.<eos> Yes.<eos> This... this isn't a romantic kiss.<eos> ~ This is a congratulations kiss.<eos> ~ Well, congratulations.<eos> There's no tongues.<eos> Uh!<eos> Please spare me.<eos> Where did...? Did you take this?<eos> No, I didn't.
And then I'm putting together gift boxes of assorted stuff.<eos> ~ Sort of spiritual survival packs.<eos> ~ That was my idea.<eos> It was Tony's idea.<eos> Dream catcher, pack of tarot, joss sticks, a few other bits of tat.<eos> ~ It's not tat!<eos> ~ Sorry, not tat, crap.<eos> ~ Tony!<eos> ~ She loves it.<eos> No, I don't, you bastard.
I don't know what you're implying.<eos> Oh! Here is my very successful business partner.<eos> Sorry it took so long.<eos> I couldn't find my pants.<eos> I don't know how they made it all the way to the loading dock.<eos> Face it Caroline, you came here to humiliate me And you can't even afford that egg.<eos> On your face.<eos> Miss, did you drop this $20 bill?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes I did!
Afraid I'll steal your crown?<eos> You were the one that was almost roasted on a spit.<eos> At least you got family on your case.<eos> I got a second-stringer, calling me senile.<eos> Nobody called you that.<eos> Okay, "dinosaur."<eos> Oh, cut it out.<eos> You cut it out.<eos> We do have something in common here, Pop.<eos> We do?
And when Powell asked him to repeat it in English, so we could take a statement, the parents said the kid saw nothing, and they shut the door in his face.<eos> They're illegals, I think they got spooked.<eos> I get it.<eos> Let's un-spook them.<eos> Hey, Eddie.<eos> You see tomorrow's roll call?<eos> Renzulli's got you riding out with McKenna.<eos> You want me to straighten this out?<eos> No, Jamie.<eos> I did that.
Thanks, I'm...<eos> Actually, we can't let you go yet.<eos> Not until Homicide gets your statement.<eos> Three months suspension from driving is like a death sentence.<eos> Who doesn't roll through a light?<eos> Hey, you were cleared of the wreck.<eos> Could have been worse. Huh?<eos> Yeah, says the guy who gets to drive while I'm in purgatory.<eos> I feel for you, man.<eos> Really, I do.
Improvise.<eos> Go.<eos> - Dawson, get on the left side.<eos> - Watch his head.<eos> Okay, we're doing this together now.<eos> Ready?<eos> Go!<eos> Watch his head, guys.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> How we doing?
I will be here all night.<eos> That was wonderful.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Oh. While Henry enjoyed some boring banter with his boring girlfriend, I broke into his boring house to plan something fun.<eos> Tell me if this has been overdone --<eos> A basil-strawberry vodka luge that empties onto three or four bisexual cage dancers.<eos> Eliza, this is Henry we're talking about, right?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna share with you some party wisdom that has been thrice confirmed by my boy Checkers, who's a bouncer, my old college roommate Peanut, and this dude I know named whiskers, who's opening up a club downtown.<eos> Why do all your friends have cat names?<eos> They just do.
After paying $30 for parking, I'm not sure we can afford it.<eos> All right, we're gonna start this one off with some new stuff!<eos> But you guys came here for some new stuff, right?<eos> Just kidding.<eos> I wouldn't want to give you the runaround.<eos> Julia, thank you for enduring this.<eos> I'm here for nostalgia more than a love of -- * Oh once upon a midnight dreary * * I woke with something in my head *<eos> I know we're close to the stage, but --<eos> You still got the pipes, Popper!<eos> No, yeah, you still do!
It turns out they can possibly make the counterspell even if we don't find Anna.<eos> They can pull the mirror dust out of the necklace - and try to use that.<eos> - It's exactly the same?<eos> Almost. It'll take a little longer.<eos> The process is difficult and...<eos> It will destroy the necklace.<eos> So the necklace can either save all of us or Anna.<eos> No. It can do both.<eos> We have time.<eos> We don't.
This is gonna be so sweet.<eos> Well, well, well, it's Frankie.<eos> Perfect timing.<eos> I just finished installing my shelves.<eos> This is a mess.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> The stud finder doesn't work.<eos> Let me see this thing.<eos> Beep, beep, beep.<eos> Yes, it does.
Come on, all right, this is a squad trip only.<eos> We're going to Vegas.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, look who it is.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What's happening, Sylvie?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> How you doing?
Damn it.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Where's your money?<eos> Payment for those books was made weeks ago.<eos> I was just delivering them to the buyer.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Do you enjoy this game you're playing?<eos> Obviously not.<eos> I'm tied to a chair in a windowless room with no cameras, - and I haven't the faintest idea why. - Yeah, you do.<eos> - Sure, you do.
My father didn't do it.<eos> ♪ CSI 15x12 ♪ Dead Woods Original Air Date on December 28, 2014<eos> She's fine, we'll see you soon.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Joanna's on her way.<eos> As soon as you give your statement, you can go home.<eos> But we need to talk about my father.<eos> I told you-- I think he's innocent.<eos> Abby, you always told me that you didn't remember anything about what happened that night.<eos> I didn't.
I could do that, and it would make my life a lot easier.<eos> Yep.<eos> You could.<eos> You could absolutely do all of that, but you won't.<eos> Honey, that's not who you are.<eos> You don't just get into something and just walk away from it.<eos> I've known you for so long...<eos> Kristina and I know that deep down, you actually--I don't know.<eos> You like helping people.<eos> No, I don't.
Unless you don't fly commercial.<eos> Homeland security is loathe to inconvenience the rich and powerful.<eos> Pull information on private jets departing the same days our victims were abducted.<eos> Crosscheck tail numbers.<eos> See if you can find a pattern.<eos> Hello?<eos> Private property.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't know anyone was here.<eos> - Well, now you do.
Understand it and retain it.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, so did you always want to be a teacher?<eos> No, I didn't know what I wanted to do.<eos> Except go to college.<eos> Which for me wasn't really an option, unless I figured out a way to pay for it myself.<eos> That's how I wound up in the ROTC, and that's why I joined the Marine Corps Air Wing.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait... s-so you, like, didn't even care about flying planes?<eos> No, of course I did.
My compassion is for you.<eos> As it is yours that rules you in this moment.<eos> Your cage is invisible, but you feel it just the same.<eos> And has it ever occurred to you that your cage is of your own making?<eos> That the bars formed the minute you decided to sleep with the man that I love, knowing that - I loved him still?<eos> - There it is.<eos> The anger I knew you bore me.<eos> How long have you been waiting for it to come out?<eos> For me to lash out at you, so I would feel as guilty as you should?<eos> But I don't.
What changed you?<eos> I've spent my life grasping for security, safety.<eos> I've lived in fear of the future, of what people might think of me and how that could help or hurt me and my family.<eos> But you offer something more interesting, something more challenging.<eos> You stand by your convictions and principles, you strive to make the world what it should be, not insulate yourself from it.<eos> I will protect you.<eos> And I you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I need you to know that.<eos> I do.
He's the sublime lover?<eos> You didn't think to share that with me?<eos> Well, this explains your change of heart.<eos> Even more reason to be cautious.<eos> If you're intrigued with him, it just makes you more vulnerable.<eos> I'm not "intrigued."<eos> I have no interest in Narcisse.<eos> You're telling me that that birthmark doesn't make you the slightest bit curious.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Do you even know if this would work...<eos> At this stage?<eos> Do you?<eos> For all we know, this could hurt her more.<eos> Yes, he does know.<eos> He knows it works.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> It does work, maggie.
Hold this.<eos> With the grain, back and forth.<eos> Smooth, always with the grain.<eos> You think this will help?<eos> Helps me.<eos> Keep sanding.<eos> I've been at the Fairfax County prosecutor's office all evening.<eos> I didn't want to tell you until I was sure it was official.<eos> We have a deal?<eos> We do.
Watch out.<eos> Whoo! Yeah, babe! Hey!<eos> No fair. Who's that?<eos> Hey, turkey water!<eos> Pfft! Weak! Ohhh!<eos> I'm it! And just like that, the Thanksgiving we never wanted to remember turned into one we'd never forget.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> And, uh, just so you know, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> You don't?
Whoo! Yeah, babe! Hey!<eos> No fair. Who's that?<eos> Hey, turkey water!<eos> Pfft! Weak! Ohhh!<eos> I'm it! And just like that, the Thanksgiving we never wanted to remember turned into one we'd never forget.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> And, uh, just so you know, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, I did.
$50.<eos> Although, you do make four times as much as I do so whatever that means to you.<eos> A little order in the court please, alright?<eos> Freshen up, settle down, and can you toss me a couple of those juice boxes, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your Honor, in the spirit of moving things along...<eos> Yes, Counselor.<eos> Given the heat and the fact that the defense has already pled no contest, I'd really like to get to Mrs. Bullock's petition for leniency.<eos> Unless, of course, the prosecution wants to do a whole song and dance about maximum sentencing.<eos> Oh, we do.
And don't tell your mother, okay? (SNIFFLES) Thanks, Daddy.<eos> Jane, the roll of cash she spends on clothes could choke a horse.<eos> I even bought an imitation couture company, but the fake stuff isn't good enough for my girl.<eos> Right? Especially now. She's upset.<eos> She and Eric, they were very close, very close since they were kids.<eos> So you're admitting he was your doctor?<eos> I don't like that word, "admit."<eos> Acknowledging?<eos> Wow, Rick, me and you, we had a good relationship once, huh?<eos> We still do, don't we?
Very, very few words.<eos> How about Luca Tessaro?<eos> Eric have any history with him?<eos> Luca's a sore subject.<eos> A sore subject.<eos> Why, because he's a Tessaro?<eos> Because he's a stain upon this family.<eos> Okay, I take it Eric didn't like him.<eos> Eric hated Luca.<eos> We all do.
Who killed Eric?<eos> You come in here, to my house of business, and accuse my daughter of not one but two murders?<eos> Not accuse, as much as...<eos> Perhaps she's a person of interest.<eos> You think I don't know what that means?<eos> You disappoint me, Rick.<eos> I came to you.<eos> I put my faith in you.<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> We did.
- Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.<eos> - Ha ha.<eos> Very funny.<eos> I'm still on the line.<eos> So about that evil plan to destroy nuktuk...<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone there?<eos> Guys! [dial tone beeping]<eos> - And with danger closing in, opal realizes How much she loves bolin and forgives him For whatever stuff he was talking about earlier<eos> Of the mover anyway. - She does? All:
The guy coming after me is Malcolm Black.<eos> He ran an illegal arms operation out of a compound in Canada.<eos> So... That's where you were the past 10 years?<eos> Malcolm smuggled me up there after I was stabbed.<eos> He forced me to launder money or he would kill Amanda.<eos> When I fled, I took evidence to protect myself.<eos> And now I have to find him to let him know that.<eos> Okay, scale of 1 to 10... How dangerous is this guy?<eos> - I don't really have a choice.<eos> - But maybe you do.
Detective Reagan.<eos> You shoot him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He called my name, I turned.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> I pulled out my gun and shot and missed.<eos> He kept going and turned to shoot.<eos> But I shot him first.<eos> You got a permit for the gun?<eos> Yes, I do.
which I, myself, will be performing... As I do every year.<eos> - All right.<eos> - All right.<eos> Henry.<eos> Henry!<eos> Eliza.<eos> Freddy?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Did you forget to gel your swoop?<eos> Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
I'll do anything.<eos> Don't hurt her.<eos> I was never here.<eos> What happened?<eos> Is anyone hurt?<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> I know I didn't deserve your help after the way I spoke to you.<eos> - You owe me an explanation.<eos> - You're right.<eos> I do.
It's... she's very close to my own age.<eos> I mean, I don't go out with women over 40.<eos> Well...<eos> - Why don't you just drop her?<eos> - What?<eos> Stop seeing her if she's not what you want.<eos> Well...<eos> Who said she's not what I want?<eos> Oh, I thought you did.<eos> I most certainly did not.
- Her bracelet was found in his house.<eos> We have an eyewitness, a neighbor who saw someone carry a body into Bill's place that night...<eos> Using this spare key.<eos> It was left on the ledge above the front door.<eos> A very smart person could have watched how the window repairman entered Mr. George's house while he was away.<eos> Taking this key from above the front door.<eos> And that's what our witness says he saw happen.<eos> He also says that he can identify the person who did it.<eos> I wish we actually had an eyewitness.<eos> We do.
- I told you not to leak that article.<eos> - Alicia, I didn't.<eos> Castro did.<eos> And you expect me to believe that?<eos> Look, we all do the same searches, we all find the same dirt.<eos> This is a good thing.<eos> This hurts Prady without reflecting on you.<eos> ...for the Palestinian cause...<eos> - You saw the news?<eos> - I did.
Atlanteans will always resist oppression, tyrant.<eos> If we go down, forgive me, lady zartra.<eos> This was my mission.<eos> I failed.<eos> No, widow.<eos> You were too busy picking up my slack.<eos> Now, watch this.<eos> Giganto went toe-to-toe with hulk and thor.<eos> You got something in your quiver better than them?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
He never affiliated with any groups or made friends with other prisoners.<eos> That's not easy to do for 12 years.<eos> Most people have an instinct for a social connection.<eos> Maybe he had one.<eos> I'm not following.<eos> Well, he didn't need any social connections when he was in prison because he already had one.<eos> Amelia Porter.<eos> Except she's somewhere in Canada sleeping among the moose and bears.<eos> People also have a natural instinct to return home.<eos> Yeah, and Benton did.
He's a Greek national that arrived here five months ago on a legit passport.<eos> He's also one of the people that Minas turned on, ID'd as a PK member.<eos> Why wasn't he picked up after Minas outed him?<eos> FBI was searching for him, but he was in the wind.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Eric.<eos> Kouris was in L.A. before Minas was.<eos> If Kouris wasn't sent here to kill Minas... what did PK send him here to do?<eos> I mean... you believe they put a known terrorist in witness protection and just lost him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Don't ask us-- ask them.<eos> You're in their custody now.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're the ones who will find out what you actually know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> Where are they taking me?<eos> We don't know.<eos> No one does.
Ye of little faith.<eos> Tomorrow night, when the stars in the sky align with the stars in the hat, I shall finally cleave myself from this dagger and be on the other side of that ice wall before dawn.<eos> Are you saying there's a bloody way out of here?<eos> Dark One always finds a way.<eos> Well, if the Dark One is so powerful, why doesn't he magic his grandson to his side?<eos> Because that would require me knowing where his mothers have locked him away for safekeeping.<eos> Now unless you really, really have no need for that tongue, I suggest you slither back outside into the hostile current and find Henry.<eos> You'll be needing this.<eos> You won't win.<eos> Villains never do.
My apartment is not that different than yours, Danny.<eos> You have your piano.<eos> I have a children's xylophone.<eos> In addition to my musical instruments, to distract us, we also have sex.<eos> - Give me!<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> Now wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> Can we even do this?<eos> I thought you had to teach residents.<eos> Mm, I did.
Just leave him, ma.<eos> Danny, I just want your mom to have a boyfriend so Valentine's day isn't you, me, and ma kissing at the top of the empire state building.<eos> That would never happen because ma and I like to get Chinese food, and then we watch goofy movies.<eos> You know what, Danny?<eos> I think that you are part of this problem.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yeah, your mom is overbearing and she's clingy, and she constantly leaves weight loss pamphlets in my purse.<eos> But she only does those things because you let her.<eos> I think you like her being around all the time.<eos> No, I don't!
Is a love triangle ever a good thing?<eos> I've made it work from time to time.<eos> Okay, so... 25,000 Maria Garcias in Los Angeles.<eos> How many Rodney Abbotts in New Orleans?<eos> What?<eos> Rodney Abbott?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> NCIS. You got a minute?<eos> Not really.<eos> You do now.
What do you think?<eos> Terrified?<eos> Oh, big-time.<eos> Then you're doing good.<eos> Mm! I gotta say, she's not at all...<eos> What I expected.<eos> I know. She's... pretty.<eos> She is.<eos> And she seems really sweet.<eos> She does.
It just sets children up to fail, and it destroys their self-esteem.<eos> - Right there.<eos> - Is he there?<eos> Is -- where --<eos> Where did she point?<eos> Where did she p--<eos> Now I look like Rod Stewart.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I have a head for business and a bod for sin.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Excuse me.<eos> - What?<eos> Your children are urinating on each other.<eos> Okay?<eos> You need to do something about that, 'cause that's just nasty.<eos> Oh, hell no!<eos> I do want a job, but not with folks who can't keep their kids from whipping out their little ding-a-lings for the whole wide world to see.<eos> That was a one-time ding-a-ling situation.<eos> You know men and their ding-a-lings.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Don't scratch.<eos> I think I know the name of the son.<eos> Daniel?<eos> How did you know?<eos> Maybe he found out he was disinherited.<eos> Mrs. Mikorski was trying to tell that little girl that the killer was her son.<eos> Looks like Daniel packed up in a hurry.<eos> He even left one shoe.<eos> Who forgets one shoe?<eos> Actually, you did last week.
I got lucky.<eos> Pretty much the greatest woman on the planet, you know?<eos> Right on.<eos> That's something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Rachel.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You got kids?<eos> I do, yeah.
I trust we met your expectations?<eos> I confess, I had my doubts, but in the end, you passed my every test.<eos> Would you say you had a five-circle visit?<eos> I...would.<eos> You should all be proud.<eos> Mr. Cavendish!<eos> Ah. That would be my car.<eos> Again, well done, all of you.<eos> I get my room back!<eos> We did it!
In a world that's dangerous and unpredictable, ere violence is always your doorstep.<eos> Always coffee.<eos> And fear is always in your heart because you or your loved ones could be the victim some hateful act against the ideals of this country.<eos> That's why I fully support husband sending the U.S.S. Roosevelt into the Gulf of Guinea.<eos> Are we still talking China, Mrs. grant?<eos> Send the Truman in.<eos> We're sending in the U.S.S. Roosevelt as a deterrent.<eos> Michael: Black with a diabetic coma of sugar.<eos> I know all your weaknesses now, Cy.<eos> Yes... you do.
I'll be needing that.<eos> This?<eos> My God, this is incredible!<eos> I just assumed she'd done it.<eos> She assumed.<eos> This changes everything.<eos> And you concluded that this was the murder weapon?<eos> It matched the wounds exactly in depth and breadth.<eos> Did you find fingermarks on the knife?<eos> We did.
- Everyone's here.<eos> - The musicians aren't.<eos> You've hummed them to the altar. What more is there?<eos> The Wedding Waltz, Thomas.<eos> Don't you remember the Wedding Waltz<eos> Oh, no; of course you don't.<eos> You were three sheets to the wind by then.<eos> And from there we'll proceed directly to the vows.<eos> I will ask you if you take your bride in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part, and you will answer...<eos> I do.

More likely because you've been lording that status ever since it was granted.<eos> - "Lording"?<eos> - You've used the term "best man" exactly 343 times<eos> - in the last two days.<eos> - Alright. Fair enough.<eos> I see how you could take it that way.<eos> I apologize for said lording.<eos> Now please just give me back the ring.<eos> George, I don't have it.<eos> And if you don't...
Yes. "And the Lord God said,<eos> 'It is not good that the man should be alone.<eos> I will make him a helpmate." And so from the soil, the Lord God fashioned all the wild beasts... '"<eos> - Father...<eos> The vows.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Of course.<eos> William Murdoch, do you take this woman to be your wife?<eos> Do you promise to be true to her in good times and bad, in sickness and in health, do you promise to love her and honour her all the days of your life?<eos> I do.
Hyung.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Please calm down.<eos> - Let go. Let me go.<eos> - Come on. Calm down.<eos> I said calm down.<eos> - How can I...<eos> How can I calm down?<eos> You don't remember what that jerk did to us? Huh?<eos> I do. I do.
I'll show it to you right now.<eos> Don't let your jaw drop in shock.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Are you getting a feel for it now?<eos> This is... 400,000 square feet. 400,000.<eos> In three months this place will be filled with cabbages.<eos> Then according to the two-year cabbage theory... this year's cabbage prices will soar no matter what.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - I did.
Oh my butt.<eos> Oh my butt.<eos> Noona.<eos> You guys really...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You should've been more careful.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hey. Right. Did you happen to see Mr. Flower?<eos> Huh? Oh, no, we didn't.
Carol Miller, will you do me the honor of un-marrying me?<eos> You've just made me the happiest woman on earth.<eos> We did it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> In a minute, in a minute.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the uncoupling of Tom and Carol Miller.<eos> If their marriage has taught us anything, it's that love is patient, love is kind, but also sometimes love is wrong.<eos> Do you, Carol, take Tom to be your lawfully-wedded husband?<eos> Do you promise to pull spinach out of his teeth, patrol his nose and ears for hair, and to always repeat the punch line to every joke on TV, in sickness and in health?<eos> I do not.

If it please Mr. Chairman and commissioners, the commission call Michael Dowd.<eos> Please remain standing, Mr. Dowd.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> I'd ask the chairman to please administer the oath.<eos> Mr. Dowd, do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in the course of your testimony during these proceedings, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
No.<eos> And I got a girl dying out there.<eos> And I swear to you... you don't tell me what I need to know, what your father did to your arms there, child's play compared to what I'm gonna do.<eos> Stop.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Do you want me to hurt you Please-please... like your father did?<eos> 'Cause I'm willing Pride.<eos> to do whatever it takes to save that girl.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
Um, let's clean up.<eos> There's a little bit of a...<eos> Everything you played was perfect.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Because much of what we term "accepted rock and roll"<eos> is a product of the street.<eos> It is only fair that we begin here with the new wave in music.<eos> We have with us tonight the Germs performing at the Whisky.<eos> What are you guys gonna do tonight?<eos> The same stuff we always do.
"I don't know, maybe start a record label, sign Nirvana, or something like that," you know.<eos> Sub Pop really started as a fanzine...<eos> And then it became a column in a local music magazine, now defunct, called The Rocket, and he put out a few cassette tapes, and then he put out the Sub Pop 100 compilation record which had different bands from all over the country.<eos> We pressed 5,000 copies, sold them all.<eos> The next record I put out was by Green River, who I thought was awesome, featuring Mr. Mark Arm went on to starting Mudhoney and so forth.<eos> The third record was, uh, Soundgarden's "Screaming Life" EP.<eos> Jon Poneman was probably the biggest Soundgarden fan in Seattle.<eos> So we joined forces to put out that record and then we opened our offices and put out all sorts of legendary stuff.<eos> Did anybody have any formal business training or know what the fuck they were doing?<eos> Still don't.
One of them could be T-Bone.<eos> Sebastian said that Jacob's killer was between five-six and five-eight.<eos> That rules out these two.<eos> Height analysis on this officer is five foot, seven inches.<eos> Sweet spot for Jacob's murderer.<eos> Run an age progression, Christopher.<eos> Age progression... coming up.<eos> 40 years later.<eos> You recognize him?<eos> Why, yes, I do.
Hello, Mr. Mailman.<eos> Meet Miss Ice Skater.<eos> Have you got a package for her?<eos> Yes! "Infinite Jest"! I wanted this!<eos> Frickin' Christmas...<eos> It's so awesome.<eos> It really is the best holiday.<eos> Every time you think you're out, it just sucks you back in.<eos> Who wants cocoa?<eos> - I do!
He brought the Snow Queen from Arendelle to this world, which means his magic is strong enough to move between that world and ours.<eos> There's a portal around here somewhere. We simply need to find it.<eos> There.<eos> Hey, grandma.<eos> Are you taking a trip?<eos> Uh, yeah. Rumple's taking me to New York for our honeymoon.<eos> But the Snow Queen left a spell on the town line.<eos> Anyone who goes can't return.<eos> Didn't you hear?<eos> No, I-I-I didn't.
That was, uh, a rather risky endeavor for an old glove, dearies.<eos> Oh, the risk was worth it.<eos> For too long we've lived in a world where the heroes always win.<eos> And the gauntlet will reveal our enemies' weaknesses, and we will be the victors.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Why... why would you do that?<eos> I... I...<eos> I mean, with that object... they still won't be able to harm you.<eos> Why do you care about me?<eos> I don't.
If there's something you can tell us, we'd appreciate it.<eos> Anything.<eos> I didn't fall.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> What-what happened?<eos> I don't wear this for attention.<eos> It's just, it's something to see in the mirror to make this world suck a little bit less.<eos> I understand.<eos> Someone else didn't.
and you weren't taking no for an answer.<eos> That was the moment I realized you were the perfect girl for me because you were just as crazy as I was.<eos> Ok.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> Something happy.<eos> Ok.<eos> Happy.<eos> Well, there is a motel ice machine in Denver that's got some stories. What else?<eos> Well, can't forget the night of your graduation.<eos> Well, I did, so...
Did I do something?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I'm in trouble.<eos> No, I'm in trouble 'cause when this changes I don't have anyplace to be.<eos> God...<eos> I used to be so careful.<eos> Wait, um...<eos> What's changing?<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> Yes, but it all changes, Alex.<eos> It always does.
No.<eos> - We have to move her to help you.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Sir, what is your name?<eos> - Norris.<eos> - I-is she...?<eos> - Norris...<eos> You don't have to worry about that right now, Sir.<eos> No, he does, actually.<eos> Of course he does.
What?<eos> I didn't say she was dead.<eos> I said she never made it to C.T.<eos> You're... you're screwing with me.<eos> I didn't take her to C.T.<eos> Because I saw you do it in the O.R., Dr. Badass.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You have a problem!<eos> No, you do.
You are welcome to our home anytime.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can stay now if you want.<eos> Agent Callen is urgently needed back in the States.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Yes, Agent Hanna, this is the gym bag with the money.<eos> How much did you say was in here?<eos> I didn't.
Please listen to me.<eos> Narcisse is trying to scare you, to serve his own purposes. Do you really think he cares whether you live or die?<eos> He did offer to marry me himself, so he could attach himself to the royal line.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> Claude, as your king, I could order you to marry Condé, however I am urging you to do it as a member of this family.<eos> I'm asking you to step forward in a way you never had to, never been asked to.<eos> For years, you have been writing me letters saying you felt you had no real place among your own blood.<eos> You want to be accepted,<eos> - respected... this is your chance...<eos> - I do.
Then I look forward to meeting her.<eos> Trust is a rare thing in this world.<eos> Stop, Henry!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> I can prove that what I told you is real.<eos> Please, Henry!<eos> I won't lose you all over again!<eos> I'll come back to you, and then you'll see that my story is true - - I'm immortal.<eos> Put it down if you love me.<eos> I do.
C.O.D. incised wound to the carotid artery.<eos> But this wasn't done by a knife.<eos> It's too irregular.<eos> Do we have a murder weapon?<eos> No.<eos> And something is off here.<eos> An English Noble takes a stroll through Central Park in the middle of the night.<eos> Somebody stabs him to death, but doesn't take his wallet?<eos> The story doesn't make sense.<eos> Well, neither does the history.
- Your behavior?<eos> You were honest.<eos> I'm feeling kind of ashamed.<eos> Lucille, you have nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I can't imagine what Barbara was thinking, showing up here like she was the Belle of the ball.<eos> She brought all of that on herself.<eos> And if that woman is out of our lives forever, so be it.<eos> ♪ that's how strong my love is ♪ We went to this concert three years ago.<eos> No.<eos> You did.
- Yeah, it is. - Mm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, honey.<eos> Things can't be the way they used to be.<eos> I know that.<eos> But we can be friends.<eos> And I think we both need one right about now.<eos> Make sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Do you understand?<eos> I understand that I will be fine.<eos> You need to protect me more on the stand.<eos> Watch the tape.<eos> Kalinda, close the door.<eos> It's me.<eos> Cary.<eos> Cary, this is a mistake.<eos> - Do you want to go back to jail?<eos> - No, I don't.
You want to do some good?<eos> We make a photo op.<eos> - That's not doing a good deed.<eos> - Stop acting like this is about you becoming a better person... it's about you appearing like you're a better person.<eos> That's what the voters respect... the image of it.<eos> Oh, you think this is counterintuitive?<eos> - It is.<eos> - That's why you're bad at this and I'm good.<eos> You think reporters want something original?<eos> They don't.
Just want... I wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks. You want to sit down? Um...<eos> Sorry. Somewhere underneath all this is a couch... for sitting.<eos> So I've been bored out of my mind.<eos> Three DUI's, one petty theft and... ooh!<eos> ... mail fraud.<eos> - Ha, ha.<eos> Did you want to talk?<eos> No, I don't.
Can you tell the jury why you decided to testify today?<eos> Paula has had the strength to sit in this courtroom every day.<eos> I'm filled with such humility, admiration, and such deep gratitude.<eos> If she can be brave enough to sit in here,<eos> I can be brave enough too.<eos> I want to take responsibility.<eos> I want to teach my son what it means to be a man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Martin, do you believe that teaching your son to be a man means teaching him to tell the truth?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Since now.<eos> Your new roommate may have other plans.<eos> I already squared things with him, and he's not moving in on her.<eos> There is no foreseeable evidence that Charlie will come out of his coma in the new future.<eos> It is our recommendation that Charlie be removed from the acute-hospital setting to one of the approved facilities.<eos> You don't think he's gonna wake up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - So that's it. We give up.<eos> You don't think that this kills me, too?<eos> Actually, I don't.
Because for me, I became confident once I, like, pretended I was and forced myself into wearing things I was shy about.<eos> Did it come after for you or...<eos> I can't remember that far back.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you look beautiful as ever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm vertical, so I'm so happy. Oh.<eos> You know why I think you did this film?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because he's very handsome, and I think you really had a crush on him.<eos> - Everybody does.
So it'll go down here, okay.<eos> - We think on the same beam.<eos> - See?<eos> We could do, you know, glitz and bling if you wanted to, or we could just do this kind of...<eos> Lots and lots of dots, right.<eos> Iris, that looks pretty great.<eos> You know you could do... maybe want to add this to it?<eos> Oh, I see how this works.<eos> Some people might have assumed this was just one piece.<eos> - People usually do.
Finally, I was in a hat shop, and these are hat bands.<eos> So I said, "Gee, that'll fit that fatso."<eos> I bought that one because she looked just like a client I had, that kind of a face.<eos> He's a cute little guy.<eos> - Carl!<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you want a cup of tea?<eos> - Do I want a cup of tea?<eos> - Oh, that would be nice.<eos> - You do?
I was quivering.<eos> I didn't know what to do with myself.<eos> I was embarrassed afterwards.<eos> I was like, "oh, I'm so sorry,"<eos> like, "I did not mean to make a mess in your bed," but then I was ready for the next time.<eos> I was like, "I'm all in."<eos> Kasen, where we going? Kasen, where we going?<eos> - Halloween!<eos> - Did he say Halloween?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Kasen's my son, and he's three.<eos> I wasn't married to his father.<eos> - Are you excited? - Mm-hmm.<eos> He calls me jana.<eos> I don't want to confuse him about anything because he's got a mom.<eos> She does a great job.<eos> He's got a dad who takes really good care of him.<eos> One, two, three, cheese.<eos> Sometimes he'll say, "I have two mommies," but we don't prompt him to do that.<eos> He does it all on his own.
You know how she is.<eos> If your thoughts contradict hers, she hates you.<eos> Even if Aunt Jenny is not open minded, she doesn't have the right to call me a whore.<eos> No, Mary... she never said that.<eos> What, morn? What did she mean when she said that "a woman who isn't married and lives alone is doing ii just for dirty fun"?<eos> Now you're overreacting, as usual.<eos> Oh for God's sake... not this again. Please, mom, don't defend her.<eos> You know she literally meant I'm a whore when she said that.<eos> She didn't mean that...<eos> She did, mom.
Today.<eos> Wait a second, just relax...<eos> Maybe she just walked away.<eos> Were you on the beach'?<eos> No, we were at home... both of us... then I went out for a moment, and when I me back she wasn't there.<eos> I'm guessing she was attracted by something outside.<eos> Maybe she smelled something.<eos> Dogs do that.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> And if she doesn't?
Congratulations, Bob.<eos> He seems great.<eos> Yep.<eos> Every father's dream. Aw. There he is!<eos> Coolest guy in school. What's up, Jeff?<eos> Oh, hi, everyone.<eos> Uh, me and my boyfriend Jeff were just looking to have a little lunch.<eos> Oh, my God, did you just say "boyfriend"?<eos> Did I?<eos> Oh, yeah, I did. Hmm.
We need to work together.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm the chief of police, and the leader of The Guard.<eos> You want to know what Haven's going to do?<eos> Whatever I decide.<eos> Not you who only even thinks about Audrey.<eos> And not you who only looks out for himself.<eos> But we can't just leave her in there while an epidemic of troubles blast this town.<eos> You want to lead, you better have a plan.<eos> I do.
Do you ever wonder if I'm real?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What if I'm like the bears?<eos> I lost my immunity to The Troubles after I was split from Mara.<eos> We don't even know if that happened.<eos> Maybe Duke didn't separate me from Mara.<eos> Maybe whatever trouble he used on her... Created me.<eos> - You're real.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe whatever trouble he used on her... Created me.<eos> - You're real.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> 'Cause I love you.<eos> You love me.<eos> And no Douen, or golem, or dancing bear can do that.<eos> You're real, Parker.<eos> You have no... no reason to think otherwise.<eos> Maybe I do.
Crap, hide.<eos> Now what, genius?<eos> Was that the governor?<eos> Did he remove the CDC from Haven?<eos> I checked up on you.<eos> You're no longer in charge of The Guard.<eos> That shouldn't matter.<eos> Lives are at risk.<eos> - You need to call the governor.<eos> - No, I don't.
I'm building to something.<eos> You know, yeah, I get a lot of attention, you know, coaching this game.<eos> But this man right here quietly defends the rights of real people with real problems.<eos> Homeless people forced to get jobs.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> That's not it, but it was so close.<eos> Yes, I am standing here boldly abolishing gay stereotypes.<eos> But...<eos> My makeup's running, isn't it?<eos> I did it!
I was too busy knowing how to ride a bike.<eos> Damn it! Now I got to do this.<eos> You know how quickly society will crumble around us if han starts feeling like he can freely tease me?<eos> You sure?<eos> - Yep. Making fun of han is one of my two free sources of entertainment.<eos> The other one is located right above this bar.<eos> Okay, I'll keep my hand on the seat, and then when you're ready, tell me, and I'll let you go.<eos> Okay, but don't let go until I say so.<eos> Okay, let go.<eos> Already did.
Let's follow them.<eos> Thanks. Stop by to sign the report tomorrow<eos> Won't you at least take me home?<eos> Can you see a meter here?<eos> This isn't a taxi<eos> Wait!<eos> You're not going to leave me?<eos> Hop it.<eos> We have to work<eos> What, and I don't?
Aw, yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Dude!<eos> What did I ever do to you, Samuel? Aw.<eos> I don't think Graham holds as many grudges as, say, Gordon or Joe would.<eos> but he'll always have that place on his vendetta chart for me.<eos> I am so lucky that I was saved by my friend Sean.<eos> Sean, you know.<eos> You know that he deserves this.<eos> Just do it, Sean.

This warrant is worthless without being cosigned by a military judge.<eos> I don't need JAG approval, and you know it.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Move out.<eos> You really want to cooperate with me, give me the decryption key for the code from the black box on Holland's wingsuit.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Black boxes are Air Force property, and if you want access, you're gonna have to talk to them.<eos> You know what that is, right, Major?<eos> Yes, I do.
Those who responded correctly were invited to donate their brains to my research.<eos> - After they died, I assume?<eos> - Ye...<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Only one agreed.<eos> Professor Richardson.<eos> - This was no ordinary cadaver, Constable.<eos> - No, clearly not.<eos> Uh... Doctor, do you have a photograph I could use for identification purposes?<eos> No, I do not.
Catch him red-handed, so to speak.<eos> But I started to have second thoughts.<eos> I tried talking her out of it but she wouldn't listen.<eos> - That's why I came here.<eos> - George. Sir?<eos> Telephone the Faculty of Medicine.<eos> I need to speak with Dr. Dempsey urgently.<eos> Sir. Mr. Barnes, I believe Mrs. Dewar is due to sign the donor papers today.<eos> I tried to dissuade her.<eos> Really, I did.
I know a few guys who do this quality of work.<eos> But I'll have to do some research.<eos> There's no time.<eos> These guys, how long has each been in the business?<eos> Uh, one guy, 30 years, the other two about five each.<eos> Well, we'll scratch the old-timer.<eos> The other two, either one has kids?<eos> Neither.<eos> How about doing time?<eos> Dirty John Tucker did a stretch.
We're archrivals.<eos> Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?<eos> Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?<eos> [Bleep]<eos> Thanks for calling best buy.<eos> How can I direct your call?<eos> Yes.<eos> My name is Kyle Broflovski.<eos> Can you tell me if I purchased an oculus rift headset there?<eos> - Or if I did.
Anything else?<eos> You can't.<eos> I nearly killed the man.<eos> I'm not cut out for this.<eos> - Sorry. - Come in.<eos> We're done here.<eos> I won't accept this.<eos> How's Rebrow?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't?
I have to let you go. State of necessity.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> And here...<eos> You all right?<eos> I heard the general was here.<eos> - He pressured you to fire me?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> - Then what did he want?<eos> - Did you tell him about the murder?<eos> He did.
I take it that wasn't... lottery winnings.<eos> I don't even know what's happening here.<eos> - I don't want to be here.<eos> - You're free to go anytime you like.<eos> Problem is, if you do, we can't guarantee you won't be grabbed up and thrown in a hole for the rest of your life.<eos> I don't want that any more than you do.<eos> Now, obviously, somebody put you up to sabotaging that plane.<eos> If you tell me the truth, I can make sure that you're treated fairly.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
Have you noticed?<eos> Changed how? He's either totally out of it, or furious.<eos> He has these fits... There's a lot going on.<eos> It's tough on him, like on the rest of us.<eos> - The baby doesn't help...<eos> - It's not about the baby!<eos> - Then what?<eos> - It's something bigger.<eos> You slept with another guy, so don't expect...<eos> So I did!
Give us some space.<eos> Was he carrying anything?<eos> Just the backpack.<eos> That was some moonshine you gave me.<eos> Let's see what you've got here.<eos> You found her.<eos> Did you see my Ewa?<eos> That night, in the woods?<eos> Did you see her?<eos> You did?
Possums.<eos> And zombie possums are second.<eos> Zombie possums?<eos> There is nothing scarier than something that is dead pretending to be dead that has come back from the dead.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I feel so close to you now.<eos> Let's celebrate with sex.<eos> Lacey, I'm trying to connect with you on a deeper level.<eos> I bet you don't even know what my favorite color is.<eos> Of course I do.
All right, thanks, Eric.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Down here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Goodsell has no family.<eos> Parents are deceased, no kids, never married.<eos> Typical Grey Man.<eos> They don't punch out at the end of the day.<eos> It's not conducive to starting a family.<eos> You did.
No, come on.<eos> Hetty didn't tell me anything.<eos> Actually, she specifically said that she didn't tell me anything.<eos> You can fool everyone else, Deeks. Can't fool me.<eos> So, you want to talk about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> Like it was even me anymore.<eos> Just a... just a different person.<eos> Well, I wish I would've known her.<eos> No, you don't.
She is, it's just a different language.<eos> It's not a different language.<eos> It's laziness.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> I'll take Tween over Tagalog any day.<eos> Eric, you find Monica?<eos> Uh, still missing, but I might have something on Turner.<eos> Now, it could be nothing, but I kept digging into his background, and I realized he's got a lot in common with Goodsell's Grey Man pattern.<eos> I mean, both guys ate at the same sushi place.<eos> So I did a little more digging.
It can't be morning.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Big day today!<eos> You're gonna get chased by robots, get set on fire... it literally burns the calories right off.<eos> Freeze, human.<eos> We have apprehended you.<eos> Beep beep. All right, time-out, time-out, time-out.<eos> You don't have the mental fortitude of someone that wants to train to not be an actual stuntman.<eos> It's like you don't even want to be here.<eos> Because I don't!
He is not getting away from me again, even if it means putting my favorite hand into his rotten stink-boot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hoo-hoo! Did you see the menu?<eos> Lobster thermidor.<eos> Baked Alaska.<eos> It's so fancy, it don't even sound like food.<eos> Here, come on.<eos> Order something.<eos> Order it.<eos> Do it.
He could be clean.<eos> He was convincing, maybe too convincing?<eos> He clearly resents his wife, bruised ego, but it doesn't fit with sitting in her closet, watching her sleep.<eos> Well, Stella is a Beverly Hills socialite, so he may be right about her having some enemies.<eos> Let's find them.<eos> What's this a benefit for again?<eos> Children.<eos> I'm getting looks.<eos> Does everyone know?<eos> Of course they do.
If you believe her, I've slept with every married man in Beverly Hills.<eos> Well, why would she say that?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Would you like a lawyer?<eos> No.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> I've done nothing wrong.<eos> How could you not tell us about the book?<eos> You didn't think it was important to our investigation?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Hearsay. Your Honor, the ASA has opened the door by presenting hearsay testimony from this missing witness.<eos> She should not be allowed to now argue that these hearsay statements are inadmissible because they hurt her case.<eos> Well, she's got you there, ASA Pine.<eos> Overruled.<eos> You may answer, Detective.<eos> Yes. This person said that he had - set up Cary Agos.<eos> - And how did he do that?<eos> By selectively turning the wire on and off to make Mr. Agos' statements seem more damning. And did he say<eos> - why he did that?
Uh, hold on, Grace.<eos> Hold on.<eos> "Grizzly mom in Illinois race shows claws."<eos> - Good headline.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> Buzzfeed. Politics.<eos> "Don't get Alicia Florrick angry.<eos> It's reported that Alicia Florrick threatened a teacher at her daughter's Tony High School with violence for forcing her daughter to work out while sick."<eos> - It doesn't have the note?<eos> - No, it doesn't.
They're starving for it at this point anyway.<eos> If they don't go for a Prady story, they'll go after you for the knifing.<eos> Yeah, Alicia, we don't agree on much, but we agree on this.<eos> - Okay, give me till tonight.<eos> - Alicia, remember what I said about things moving fast.<eos> Eli, please, we'll talk tonight.<eos> - You gave them reasonable doubt.<eos> - I know.<eos> Do you know what to do?<eos> - I do.
So, fellow lawyer...<eos> I have a request that's gonna make us both uncomfortable.<eos> - Great.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> - You heard about Cary's trial?<eos> - He lost a juror. - Yes.<eos> We need to find Dante.<eos> He's the only one still alive who can testify that Cary's innocent, that the wire was edited.<eos> - You know I can't say anything.<eos> - I do.
I mean, you were 4, but still, find a better hiding spot. Aah!<eos> I think she did just fine.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> You don't find it the least bit strange that they just up and left?<eos> I told you she's his family.<eos> If they want to talk, let them talk.<eos> What the hell do you care?<eos> Because I care about the truth, care about authenticity.<eos> Or you just hate Stefan.<eos> I do actually, yeah.
I fixed it.<eos> Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.<eos> I just couldn't bear to look at it again.<eos> I just can't believe it's gone.<eos> You want to go inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You son of a bitch!<eos> What have you done to my marriage?<eos> !<eos> Peter?<eos> Lois, don't do this!<eos> I think I had, like, a Christmas miracle.<eos> I realized I don't want other people humping my wife for a chair.<eos> It's okay, Peter.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> It didn't?
Although it wasn't for a job.<eos> I will raise that baby with you.<eos> Jared...<eos> I am ready to be a father.<eos> This should not be on camera.<eos> I'm such a mess.<eos> I'll never be a real sportscaster.<eos> Oh, now, don't say that.<eos> You know what, I think you're gonna get your dream job someday.<eos> You do?
I'll be ready when Jordan's awake.<eos> He's going first.<eos> How long till he can walk?<eos> We're not sure when he'll wake up.<eos> It could be days, months.<eos> I'm not just gonna give up on him.<eos> Oh, that's if we're lucky.<eos> - Look, I know.<eos> - I know how bad you feel.<eos> I do.
Oh, that's if we're lucky.<eos> - Look, I know.<eos> - I know how bad you feel.<eos> I do.<eos> But it doesn't mean that you should give up on the possibility of walking yourself.<eos> I'm sure that Jordan wouldn't want you to.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You know what he wants?<eos> See, he's my best friend.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I didn't...
What?<eos> Uh, Mindy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I am legit concussed here.<eos> All right, pal.<eos> Rest up, okay?<eos> Hey, Danny?<eos> Yeah, buddy?<eos> Thanks for coming to visit me.<eos> None of my other friends did.
You're not supposed to be back here.<eos> Nora Garcia?<eos> Detective Lawrence and Detective Larsen.<eos> We need to speak to you about Henry White.<eos> The bus driver?<eos> He was attacked last night, got beaten up pretty badly.<eos> Big Guero like that should be able to handle himself in a fight.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> I burnt it on a steam iron.<eos> I do it all the time. So?
I couldn't see it burned so badly.<eos> How long has she been a client?<eos> 6 weeks.<eos> I mean, she was always so nice.<eos> I don't know why she would do this to me.<eos> You're her second victim.<eos> She was talking you both in plain sight, getting to know you, sitting in your chair, figuring out your schedule.<eos> First victim was a bus driver Henry White.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> No, I don't.
Let's put that on the welcome signs. [laughter] That'll bring in the tourists.<eos> Come to Liverpool!<eos> We have Beatles and mosquitoes!<eos> And one of them carries a deadly disease!<eos> Find out which one!<eos> Ringo?<eos> -I know a little fact.<eos> Did you know that people in Scotland by 40 bottles of whiskey every second?<eos> -This is my favorite country ever.<eos> Do they NASCAR in the uck?
is truly, truly smart.<eos> - Good job, Abby.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Abby., who I originally thought could be going home early.<eos> I'm starting to respect her a lot more than I did when I walked in.<eos> Right, next up please, Sean.<eos> I'm feeling a little nervous, walking up to the judges, because I got the most ingredients and if they don't like my dish, it's going to be embarrassing.<eos> - Sean, how you doing?
It's a celebration!<eos> Let's keep it light.<eos> Light, light, light!<eos> Why J.D., I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> Welcome. Holly, it was just so nice of you to invite me to your home.<eos> You know, all of a sudden now this city seems a lot friendlier and prettier, too.<eos> J.D., you know, I want you to feel totally comfortable.<eos> And since you don't know anyone, I think you should stick close to me, real close.<eos> You sure know how to make a guy feel welcome.<eos> Yes, I do.

-Yeah. -It is a bit serious.<eos> There is a whiff of serious. It's taking it all seriously.<eos> That might be a Jag, but it's mental.<eos> It's lunatic.<eos> -It's...<eos> -It's got a sticky front and a loose back end.<eos> -And who doesn't like that?<eos> -Yeah, exactly.<eos> Not a phrase for a first date, obviously.<eos> No, exactly. But I do like...
I'd rather... 2.8 is more powerful.<eos> The 2.8 is more powerful, and you like power, etcetera...<eos> Yes, I know, but the three-litre's got carburettors, yours, you...<eos> I want the three-litre 'cause...<eos> You've got a fuel injection?<eos> I don't want fuel injection. I want cars, it's a classic car.<eos> No, no. The 2.8 is classic.<eos> You know, you want a Capri 2.8.<eos> -No.<eos> -You do.
And perhaps you could bring yourself to feel the same for another?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Come on, Jason. Aargh! Oh, he caught him.<eos> It'll need binding.<eos> The Gods smiled on you.<eos> Ariadne.<eos> You did Atlantis proud.<eos> And my Queen?<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing, she's great.<eos> Everything's great.<eos> And that's a good thing, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just don't have any excuses now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I gave her up so that she could have this great life.<eos> And she does.
Find somewhere safe.<eos> Safe and warm.<eos> A cafe on the seafront.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know how hard this must be to hear.<eos> I should have listened to her.<eos> There were bottles of pills, yes.<eos> Bottles of drink, so... yes, it looks like an overdose, but there's no way to be certain of anything, at this stage, except that it wasn't your fault.<eos> Shirley didn't want me to go looking for Tom.<eos> No, she didn't.
Okay.<eos> Well, while you do that,<eos> I just remembered I left something in my car.<eos> A hamster.<eos> I got it for my nephew's birthday and I need to crack a window.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> It's very small.<eos> I don't think she suspects a thing.<eos> - Did you get the knife?<eos> - Oh, yes, I did.
I just think that you should...<eos> Take it easy, that's all.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> And from the looks of your cushy life, you don't know anything at all.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> I used to do the same thing with my dad.<eos> You did?
Stanford?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jean, that's for the smart kids.<eos> You will go there, you will learn the latest in fertility techniques for eight months, you will return, and teach them here.<eos> Wow, Jean.<eos> You're believing in me?<eos> I hope it doesn't go to my head.<eos> So that's a "yes."<eos> I want to say yes.<eos> I really do.
- Providing you rest. - Rest?<eos> And stay out of the sun.<eos> We shall be all right then.<eos> And without either of those things?<eos> We'll be dead in a couple of days.<eos> Impossible. I intend to die with a beautiful woman in one hand, and a jug of ale in the other.<eos> And you're going to look for them now?<eos> No, I'm going to look for somewhere to, uh, contemplate my existence.<eos> I'm not sure I deserve such loyalty.<eos> No, you almost certainly do not.
Here we go, old friend.<eos> I won't let this meal be your last.<eos> - I am not sure I am hungry.<eos> - But you will eat.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Pasiphae will stop at nothing until I am dead.<eos> And do you know what the strange thing is?<eos> That doesn't scare me any more.<eos> You must have great faith in your protectors.<eos> Indeed I do.
And does braided herring and jellied starfish count as food?<eos> Oh, indeed it does.<eos> I may be stuck in a tiny room, but my palate will travel the world.<eos> Listen up.<eos> This is a real small room.<eos> If you start getting on each other's nerves, do what I do with my babies:<eos> Go to separate corners.<eos> We call it "alone zones."<eos> All due respect, sarge, but we don't need "alone zones."<eos> No, we do not.
You better be right about this 'cause you are dead wrong about appletinis having ice.<eos> Hey! Guys, hold on a second!<eos> Yes, Daryl.<eos> You forgot your sunglasses.<eos> Happy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> These aren't my sunglasses.<eos> I cannot believe Haley didn't like the shoes.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Of course she did.
I use the voice.<eos> Wait.<eos> So, I can't pull off mid-thigh shorts?<eos> No, you can.<eos> Pull them off and give them to somebody 20 years younger.<eos> You're so silly!<eos> What are you two giggling about?<eos> Haley just asked me --<eos> Oh, you don't want to know, trust me.<eos> No, I do.

- Uh, nothing.<eos> - Just talking.<eos> - Not really anything.<eos> Can we finish our conversation?<eos> No.<eos> Lily, I'm sorry, but if you have questions, you're gonna have to ask your dads.<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> - I do so.<eos> - Uh-huh, I know.<eos> No, we don't. Right, guys?
- Or the moon and some stars.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Mm.<eos> Or, like, a bird and a rifle.<eos> - Oh, my god, let's do that!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> I mean, not that, but, like, let's get matching tattoos!<eos> I want to do that with you.<eos> - You do?
Knight to C3. [Click]<eos> Your move, little man.<eos> Now would probably be a good time to tell Dr. Naday I don't know how to play chess. [Clicking] You want me to move your prawn to D5?<eos> Charlie: I'm also not the best typist.<eos> Pawn to D5. Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pawn...<eos> D5.<eos> [Click] You know you want to hit that, right?<eos> I do.

Did you get to him?<eos> No.<eos> No, he disappeared.<eos> But I will find him.<eos> - I was going to visit my brother in Navarre, but I turned back as soon as I heard the news.<eos> Where's Mary?<eos> She's fine... getting some much-needed rest.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Francis, you must know my loyalty lies with you.<eos> I do.
We are done here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I'd say if you want to focus on the other two paragraphs, probably be a good bet, okay?<eos> - Good job.<eos> - Chris.<eos> - Fiona, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me sometime.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> Oh, no, of course you don't.
Well, at least the department can go ahead with the inspector's funeral this time.<eos> Would've been pretty scandalous if they had to cancel two in a week.<eos> Two is not the number that consumes me.<eos> I still believe the mysterious Six is the bridge between Flynn and Buros.<eos> Unfortunately, not a single drug dealer in the New York area seems to use the name Six.<eos> Frustrating.<eos> How is your mindfulness right now?<eos> Can I go in there and get my glasses without being shot?<eos> Did you go to a meeting this morning?<eos> I did.
Bad news, Hammond.<eos> Ow!<eos> Ow, ow, ow!<eos> Ow!<eos> Ah!<eos> Ah!<eos> This immediately caused the ever-troublesome Mustang to have a puncture.<eos> James, do you want to wait for him or...?<eos> Well, do you know, under the circumstances, I think it would be fair to...<eos> No, I don't.
Hang on. Hang on.<eos> Which Buttershaw fella?<eos> Your dad.<eos> In 1966?<eos> ~ Yeah. ~ No.<eos> No, er...<eos> He married my mum in 1957.<eos> Yeah, well, OK. But...<eos> Do you know how many Buttershaws there are round here?<eos> I do, yeah.
It's a bit delicate.<eos> Do you remember, when I was little, in the house up Barkisland... there was the bureau at the top of the stairs?<eos> ~ Oh. ~ And in it, there was all... stuff.<eos> And do you remember a little tin box, with a red cover, in the shape of a book?<eos> "Tall oaks from little acorns grow."<eos> And in it, there was a photo of a woman.<eos> And on the back, it said "Mary."<eos> Did it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did.
~ Waterways and Rivers Authority.<eos> ~ Yeah, them.<eos> Evil bastards.<eos> Your mum never knew.<eos> It finished before it even started, really.<eos> It were... ridiculous.<eos> An embarrassment.<eos> It should never have happened.<eos> How do you know she didn't know?<eos> She didn't.
♪ And the feeling's right ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, yes, it's ladies' night, oh, what a night ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, what a night. ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, there.<eos> I pour strong when the alcohol's free.<eos> I have to cram a lot of fun - into a short amount of time. - Mmm.<eos> Kind of like sex with Roger.<eos> What is it with guys and their constant need for sex?<eos> Look at Alan here.<eos> He's out with two women, but I bet even he wants sex right now.<eos> I do.

Oh, good.<eos> It can't be you because you left the troop before the humiliating office incident.<eos> That's why I need you to rejoin.<eos> Talk to the girls.<eos> Find the mole.<eos> Me?<eos> Rejoin?<eos> But my wounds are still fresh.<eos> I mean, I don't actually have wounds.<eos> And if I did,
I believe what you're trying to say is,<eos> "Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Louise, for helping me smoke out the mole."<eos> Louise, you're going to destroy the troop!<eos> Why do you care so much about the troop, anyway?<eos> They rejected you, remember?<eos> Troop 119 shaped me into the woman I am.<eos> I thought your underwear did that.<eos> Tina, we tried things your way.<eos> No, we didn't.
Of course he is.<eos> He's never brought me anything I asked for.<eos> Hey, I am sure that Santa's gonna come through for you this year, buddy.<eos> That's what grown-ups always say.<eos> Come inside with me.<eos> I made gingerbread Zippys.<eos> I was gonna make gingerbread houses, but everybody knows Zippys don't have houses.<eos> A six-year-old boy who doesn't believe in Santa.<eos> How sad is that?<eos> Almost as sad as my 20-year-old boy who does.
He was basically squatting.<eos> Right. Well he was found unconscious this morning.<eos> He was in a pretty bad way so he was rushed to the hospital.<eos> Did he do drugs?<eos> No!<eos> What hospital?<eos> Bridge Heath General.<eos> He's conscious now.<eos> Does he have any clothes here at all?<eos> Um, yeah. Yeah, he does, yeah.
Yeah.<eos> The sword-swallower, the contortionist, you know?<eos> All those clowns coming out of that Murphy bed.<eos> There was a lot of moving parts.<eos> Wait. You read her book?<eos> Page by page.<eos> Every night,<eos> Victoria picks a section, and we try to come as close as we can to doing what the characters are doing.<eos> Have you no decency?<eos> No, I do not.
Then everyone cried because, you know, Kurt Cobain died.<eos> Then we get in the car to go home.<eos> And he starts yelling at me for embarrassing him.<eos> His reaction was so crazy I thought he was kidding.<eos> So I laughed.<eos> And he slapped me so hard I heard ringing in my ears.<eos> And that was the beginning.<eos> I packed my bags so many times.<eos> But he always said that he loved me and it would never happen again.<eos> Until it did.
Would you look at all these credit card charges?<eos> I thought we agreed to cut down on our spending.<eos> I didn't agree.<eos> I said I thought it was a good idea, okay?<eos> And I still do.
Please Haris, call the police.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> That man is dangerous.<eos> I'll call them, then.<eos> We mustn't call the police!<eos> In the morning you have to go to your parents to hide, for a while.<eos> Why don't we go together?<eos> To get away.<eos> Andrea... You know why I'm doing all this.<eos> I do.
What are you doing?<eos> No, tell me about him.<eos> I mean... you know, do I remind you of him?<eos> No.<eos> Is it my laugh? My voice?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do I look like him?<eos> Do I look like him, Nikki?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> How did you know about this place?<eos> Do you know where the President is?<eos> Answer the question!<eos> Now!<eos> Do you know where the President is?<eos> - Han Tae Kyung.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do.
And I have not been outside.<eos> I'm sorry, whose accusing you of anything?<eos> You!<eos> Oh, god...<eos> What can we do...<eos> Transport Police!<eos> - Where's Max? - He's fine.<eos> He's crashing with Elaine.<eos> Well, what's going on? I thought this was supposed to be a stopping service.<eos> - So did I.
"Home".<eos> Give it to me.<eos> How long til end of line? At this speed if we don't run into anything maybe half an hour.<eos> - Maybe half an hour.<eos> - We can't just leave her.<eos> - What about us!<eos> - Lewis, what about your boy!<eos> Lewis, does she have any chance?<eos> - If I had a defib.<eos> - But you don't.
I mean, think about it.<eos> They want the most ruthless one of us to join them.<eos> I mean, it's like how they used to pick the next Catholic Pope, back in the Holy Roman Empire.<eos> They'd take all the nominated Bishops and they'd lock them in the Sistine Chapel together... to fight it out until there was only one left.<eos> And it was believed that the one who survived was ordained and chosen by God.<eos> You know?<eos> It makes sense, right?<eos> That's exactly the kind of fucked up shit you'd expect from the Catholic Church.<eos> You got something against Catholics?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sure you can.<eos> I'm allowed to comp a friend's meal once in a while.<eos> Thank you, but I insist.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know you've had it rough lately.<eos> Let me do this for you.<eos> I appreciate it, so nice.<eos> But really it's not necessary.<eos> I got a new job.<eos> You did?
I don't deserve this, João?<eos> Who did this to you? With you.<eos> Get out of my house you scum!<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> - Dad, stop!<eos> - Calm down, dad!<eos> - Calm down my ass!<eos> - I love your daughter.<eos> Like hell you do, you son of a bitch!
Fucking do it already.<eos> Just one more time.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, fucking do it already!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get up! Oh, God damn it.<eos> Do it already.
Just one more time.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, fucking do it already!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get up! Oh, God damn it.<eos> Do it already.<eos> Fucking do it already!
Right, Panisse?<eos> Enough, Félix.<eos> Stay out of my family business.<eos> I don't ask about your wife and the Yacht Club chairman.<eos> - I didn't know about that one.<eos> - It's not true, Félix.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Be as discreet and don't talk to me about Marius.<eos> You too, Mr. Two-Face.<eos> - I did nothing.
But I can protect and defend them.<eos> And in two years, she'll marry.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> If he comes back, will he want to marry her?<eos> Absolutely. I'm sure of it.<eos> He's written twice, not to me, to you.<eos> But he mentioned you.<eos> Like a stranger.<eos> Does he mention her in his new letter?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Absolutely. I'm sure of it.<eos> He's written twice, not to me, to you.<eos> But he mentioned you.<eos> Like a stranger.<eos> Does he mention her in his new letter?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> How do you know?<eos> If he did, you'd have said.<eos> Does he talk about coming home?<eos> No, he doesn't.
- That's what he wrote to me.<eos> - You see.<eos> I'll need to think it over.<eos> If I left him the bar, along with what you have, that'll be two million.<eos> Fanny, just think, by the time he's 20, the boy could smoke cigars as thick as his arm!<eos> If it isn't a girl.<eos> A girl?<eos> What an idea! Shut up or you'll jinx us!<eos> No, I don't sing.<eos> - But someone does.
I'm not asking you to tell me her name.<eos> I know you'll refuse.<eos> But, tell me it isn't Escartefigue's wife.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> All right.<eos> So what do we do about Fanny?<eos> Let's wait.<eos> What if she accepts Panisse?<eos> She won't.<eos> What if she does?
- A ship passing by.<eos> She sounded her horn to avoid a collision.<eos> She's a big one!<eos> What goes opposite the dresser?<eos> Our bed.<eos> He's not here.<eos> If Fanny's here, Marius is too.<eos> I want a word.<eos> Go ahead. Marius has no secrets from me.<eos> Maybe not, but I do.
No, there isn't.<eos> Stop being a dick<eos> - and get Daisy something to eat.<eos> - I'm not a dick!<eos> - I'm actually not that hungry.<eos> - Dick dick dick.<eos> All right, jet, I'm doing it.<eos> We let you sleep in.<eos> Eddie said you needed to catch up on some rest.<eos> - Did he?
This last one... Okaloosa, mostly.<eos> That's near Pensacola?<eos> Nicer than Glades from the outside, but the tiers were shit.<eos> I used to work out of the Miami office. Didn't get up north much.<eos> Yeah, I grew up down near Glades...<eos> West of Belle Glade, out near Immolakee.<eos> Prefer it up north, though.<eos> Better class of people, by and large.<eos> You move up north once you started fighting?<eos> - You ever do any?
Don't ask me any questions because I'm only going to tell you what I want to tell you.<eos> The man who calls himself Rodrigo took something from me.<eos> He's in business with three other men.<eos> They're here for a robbery and they're gonna use that house to lay low when they're done.<eos> So...<eos> You let them steal something, you steal it from them.<eos> I help you and I get a commission.<eos> You're going to kill them, aren't you?<eos> I never said that, Leslie.<eos> You did.
All right.<eos> All right, get the fuck off me!<eos> You're all right.<eos> Here, let me help you.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Come on, now, gonna sit down and talk.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> You don't want to die, do you?<eos> - Do you?
You don't want to die, do you?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - No.<eos> Then tell me where he is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Check the house. Every inch!<eos> You know who those belong to?<eos> No.<eos> I don't have any idea.<eos> Yeah, you do.
We have her back, Brian.<eos> Well, do me a favor and give Jack a kiss goodnight for me.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I love you, Mia.<eos> She definitely saw it was you?<eos> She looked dead at me, Brian.<eos> Maybe the Letty we once knew is gone, Dom.<eos> Even though she's alive, maybe she's gone.<eos> You don't turn your back on family.<eos> Even when they do.
Good day, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I, um, I got the information in here.<eos> May I ask why you're looking for Shaw?<eos> He took something of ours.<eos> We'd like to talk to him about it.<eos> Let's see what we've got.<eos> All right. What do you want?<eos> They say if someone's looking for a Russian gun, you're the man to see.<eos> Oh, they do, do they?
About a week ago, a girl came in, bought guns, ammo, everything I had.<eos> A girl?<eos> What did she look like?<eos> Tough chick, dark hair.<eos> Mean streak.<eos> Word is she's a street racer.<eos> Where can we find her?<eos> How do I know? Do I look like a racer?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
What? You didn't think one would recognize you?<eos> I've kept tabs on you, you know.<eos> You've been having a lot of fun out there.<eos> Good cop gone bad, Rio de Janeiro.<eos> It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?<eos> Too bad you didn't do it earlier, you could have worked for me.<eos> Like Letty Ortiz?<eos> So tell me something, because I buried her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You did?
Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to.<eos> So, what's our next adventure after this?<eos> How about we stay in one place?<eos> Where are you thinking?<eos> Tokyo.<eos> We always talk about Tokyo.<eos> Tokyo it is.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> How did you know that there would be a car there to break our fall?<eos> I didn't.
- When I was a camper..um..<eos> They called the island, Goat Island. And I was marooned, and ... And ...<eos> I was a goat. I was scared at first, but it all worked out.<eos> See.<eos> - We have to find her, you understand that?<eos> - Absolutely<eos> We have to find her right now!<eos> The Sheriff office, the local police and the county juvenile division are all engaged in a coordinate effort to secure your daughter's safety.<eos> - I understand how you must be feeling.<eos> - No. You don't.

Thanks for coming so fast.<eos> Lockwood's honey stand is out near the county's bridge.<eos> It's not far. Ok.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Mom said said to wait where we were.<eos> Near the honey stand.<eos> She promised me that you could come home with us.<eos> - No, she didn't mean it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Yes, she did.
She promised me that you could come home with us.<eos> - No, she didn't mean it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> - She couldn't! It's against the law!<eos> - What is?<eos> - Us.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Did they say anything about my parents coming?<eos> No, she didn't.
Lucy!<eos> Youhavegot company.<eos> There was a really bad famine in the 3rd century.<eos> These butcher, lured 3 little boys into their shop, murder them, soaked them in a barrel of brim.<eos> - It must have been a huge barrel. - Why, chopped them up!<eos> He's been selling them as ham.<eos> Then Saint Nicholas, brought the little boys back to life.<eos> Saint Nicholas like Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas?<eos> Yeah, a lot of people don't know that about.<eos> I didn't.
Why don't you guys come over here for brunch.<eos> Yeah, Lucy always made some mountain of food.<eos> They're like brother and sister already, so... - you know, we're already like family.<eos> - Okay! - 11 o'clock on Sunday? - Alright.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Alright, I'll see you then.<eos> We're gonna have Easter brunch on Sunday together.<eos> How great is that?<eos> Did you know that I used to babysit your mom?<eos> Of course she does.
That's the Fire and Police Department.<eos> If the Hive goes down, this whole city goes dark.<eos> Question here.<eos> Why do they call it the Hive?<eos> Listen. Hear all those little worker bees?<eos> Hey, what about Max?<eos> You know he wants to bone you, right?<eos> Oh, my God, Autumn.<eos> Stop it, that's disgusting.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Right. Hey, I'm glad I caught you.<eos> We're having a singles' barbecue at the church this Saturday.<eos> You should come.<eos> I'm not single, though.<eos> I'm just happy.<eos> I thought you weren't seeing anyone.<eos> Right.<eos> Happily.<eos> So you'll think about it?<eos> I just did.
My watch stopped.<eos> There's somebody out there.<eos> They found us.<eos> They're raising the boat.<eos> This is a restricted area, Captain.<eos> This was my boat.<eos> And this is my captain's family.<eos> Apparently the Americans showed self-discipline.<eos> We didn't make it, did we?<eos> No, son, we didn't.
So, what did you do in Santiago?<eos> What?<eos> I told you. I had to retake an exam.<eos> No, thats not what you said on the phone last night.<eos> We didnt talk on the phone last night.<eos> Yes, we did, when I told you about Brink.<eos> We didnt talk about that.<eos> Agustin just told me about the stupid fight you guys had last night.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, we did.
- Dill, put the gun down.<eos> Please put the gun down.<eos> - Come on. Listen to your dad.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> - Move.<eos> - No!<eos> - He deserves to die.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He does.
You kidding me?<eos> Just get this over with before anybody sees us.<eos> - Father?<eos> - Everybody ready?<eos> Just give us the Cliff Notes version.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have...<eos> Oh, come on, please, before anything else happens.<eos> Okey dokey.<eos> Melissa, do you take...<eos> Yes, I do.
- Everybody ready?<eos> Just give us the Cliff Notes version.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have...<eos> Oh, come on, please, before anything else happens.<eos> Okey dokey.<eos> Melissa, do you take...<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Do you, Alejandro Soto Griffin...<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Marc?<eos> Help... me...<eos> Every morning I send a boyfriend to work... And this is what you get back.<eos> Look. Do you like it?<eos> - It's terrifying.<eos> - I might not sell this one.<eos> I think I'd rather keep it.<eos> Julia...<eos> Not for now. For when we decide to.<eos> Or when you do.
Apologise.<eos> We... had promised not to come up.<eos> We just wanted to make sure he got here safely, now that he's made the big decision.<eos> May the children see him inside?<eos> What a nice place.<eos> It's... so bohemian.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> - You need the car key.<eos> - Uh, no, I don't need the car.<eos> Oh yes, you do.
Quinoa, kelp, spelt.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Mom... - I'm not dead.<eos> I'm just re-evaluating.<eos> Hey, Harvard!<eos> What!<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without your little PJs on.<eos> Did Henry tell you that I work here?<eos> No, actually...<eos> No, he did not.
Here you are, sir.<eos> And by the way, we do have spirits available this evening.<eos> Good, I'll have a whiskey.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> You need to eat, you'll feel better.<eos> Come on, Ewa. Come on.<eos> Eat something.<eos> Do you want to try a little bit?<eos> Please, we don't want you to get sick.<eos> How long I do this?
Edyta, who is it?<eos> Wojtek! Wojtek, Ewa is here!<eos> Ewa found us!<eos> We haven't met since the wedding. But I remember you, uncle.<eos> You should get her something to eat and drink.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Come, I will make you some tea.<eos> They said you weren't on the boat.<eos> Your uncle went to Ellis Island, and they said you never came.<eos> No, we did.
No! No!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Doug is my insurance.<eos> He stays with me.<eos> You don't give me Chow, I blow his brains out.<eos> You go to the cops I blow his brains out.<eos> That's insane!<eos> We don't even know where the fuck he is!<eos> No one does.
At the time, I thought it was "Chow" like "goodbye."<eos> You know, like, "Chow, arrivederci."<eos> - You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.<eos> - I'm writing him back.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> Gonna tell him you're happy he's out and you'd love to see him.<eos> I would love to see him.<eos> Do you even know what's going on?<eos> Yes, I do.
I am.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Listen Richard, you laid into a man.<eos> He needs care.<eos> The ship moved away from the quay.<eos> The children waved to their father who stood on the poop deck.<eos> He waved back with a small handkerchief.<eos> The ship passed the pier and sailed out to sea.<eos> Their father grew smaller and smaller, but he kept waving.<eos> And so did they, of course.
I'll fucking shoot it, okay?<eos> Bad doggy.<eos> Hey, man, wanna go for a ride?<eos> I used to hate it when the water turned cold all of a sudden.<eos> Because when I was little, that's where I used to think all the monsters were.<eos> Do you ever think about dying?<eos> What?<eos> Like dying, someone killing you, or you killing yourself.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I do.
I'd be grateful if you let me stay till nightfall.<eos> I'd try and help out.<eos> I wouldn't ask anything of you.<eos> You just did.<eos> Nothing more than a place to lay low and rest my leg for a few hours.<eos> How do I...<eos> How do I know you won't hurt us?<eos> I've never intentionally hurt anyone in my life.<eos> You understand how that could be hard to believe.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> - What about Claire?<eos> Where does she think you are?<eos> - She thinks I'm working late.<eos> - Really?<eos> This late?<eos> - We have international clients.<eos> Sometimes we have long conference calls at weird hours.<eos> It happens.<eos> - It does?
- Okay.<eos> - Kipper.<eos> - Couple of days, right, marv?<eos> Just... Go home to your wife.<eos> I got a pretty good idea of what I got to do.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - I'm gonna clean it all up.<eos> - Man, I owe you so big.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You do.
I hate him.<eos> I hate you!<eos> I ... hateyou...<eos> You pig!<eos> I hate you!<eos> And that shitty guitar!<eos> I ... hate...<eos> You pig!<eos> That works with men , too?<eos> - Yes, it does.
A very good afternoon to you.<eos> Could I come in for a moment?<eos> You've come from my husband.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And what's it about?<eos> Well...<eos> - It's about...<eos> - Mama,<eos> - Tatti took my doll again.<eos> - I did not.
Half-Jew.<eos> You have a problem with that?<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> That would be great!<eos> That would be great.<eos> How?<eos> I mean, how so?<eos> Victor, do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior?<eos> Victor?<eos> I do.
I don't know, DL.<eos> That's hardcore, man.<eos> Start the fucking car and go!<eos> Back over him.<eos> Get it over quick.<eos> It's like ripping off a Band-Aid. Just do it!<eos> Don't make Pepe suffer.<eos> I knew you could do it, Paul.<eos> You just killed a man.<eos> We did.

All of that's mine.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> You want another one?<eos> Ah, I do but I won't. I mustn't.<eos> I can't.<eos> How could he fire me when I set the whole fucking thing up?<eos> Did you?<eos> Don't you know anything about your father?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
As excuses go, it's not terrible.<eos> But I saw you on TV.<eos> You were in New York!<eos> Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world but I was wrong.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> But I believe that fate brought us together.<eos> Jane, I don't know where you were, or what happened, but I do know this...<eos> What?<eos> I know...<eos> You do?
I'm so glad you're outside of the fantasy.<eos> Makes it easier to walk away from it all.<eos> You know my flight leaves tomorrow, but I could see if I could change it. Stay a few extra days in London.<eos> That's an offer I...<eos> I'm not gonna refuse.<eos> I fancy seeing you in...<eos> I don't know, some trousers or...<eos> Do you wear anything less 1800s, ever?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I do the short shorts.
Hand, what did you do?<eos> There's nothing wrong with your hand, young Lockwood.<eos> You see, I am merely a hologram of the real Chester V.<eos> The United Nations has asked me and my Thinkquanauts to assist in the cleanup and containment of the leftovers all over the world.<eos> Including your Swallow Falls.<eos> We'll get started on the cleanup right away.<eos> As soon as you all leave.<eos> What? You need us to leave?<eos> Listen up, ghost man you expect us to skedaddle from our homes because of some nasty leftovers?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Why are you being so weird to your friends?<eos> What?<eos> I haven't been weird.<eos> You karate-chopped Manny's stew out of Brent's hands.<eos> You hurt their feelings.<eos> Sam, you wouldn't understand.<eos> I do understand, but you're forgetting that:<eos> "A bully turned friend will be friend to the end."<eos> Listen, Brent came here to help you.<eos> We all did.
It is true.<eos> The dessert creatures are especially sweet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe we...<eos> Mosquitoast!<eos> Was gonna bite you.<eos> See?<eos> Even the tiniest creatures are attacking us.<eos> The only reason they're biting is because of the drop in barometric pressure.<eos> Bugs do that before a storm.
Food that is not friendly.<eos> - Food that cannot love!<eos> - Flint we should be studying the food animals, not killing them.<eos> What if he's wrong?<eos> The choice is yours, son.<eos> Live up to your full potential or walk away and let the food monsters destroy Lady Liberty.<eos> Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR and saving the world that's what matters.<eos> Really?<eos> Our opinion doesn't matter?<eos> Of course it does!
You wouldn't happen to have a popsicle I could stick up my ass, would you?<eos> A martini.<eos> Extra dirty.<eos> Two olives.<eos> All we have is tequila and Chango.<eos> Right.<eos> For a moment there, I forgot I was in a black hole of sophistication.<eos> Chango it is.<eos> Although, your limited selection of Mexican beer is not what brings me here.<eos> So what does?
Hey, there's a dragon in this trap! Help.<eos> Help.<eos> Let's see who this dragon ghost really is.<eos> George Takei?<eos> That's right.<eos> And I would never have gotten away with it, regardless of you meddling kids.<eos> But, like, that dragon ghost was hovering and translucent. Yes.<eos> You see, I used the projector from my Kabuki theater.<eos> But Kabuki theaters don't have a projector.<eos> Some do.
You?<eos> I've modeled the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast.<eos> It should rip us out of stasis, back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button.<eos> You mean we'll all get to live our lives over again?<eos> Oh, my, yes.<eos> Even that nasty robot, what's-his-name.<eos> Of course, we won't remember anything that's happened.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Want to go around again?<eos> I do.
Brilliant, and look, that, see, that's one of the greatest captains ever, Roger Burton.<eos> And there, there, that's Duncan.<eos> Duncan Edwards.<eos> So young.<eos> These lads were like you boys once.<eos> They played for their town and country.<eos> - I'll never be as great as them.<eos> - Never?<eos> Do you wanna be as great as them?<eos> - Course I do.
- Matt lied to me.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> And now I'm never playing football again.<eos> Just like you wanted.<eos> - Just like I wanted?<eos> Look, Georgie, I've not always had the best ideas, but I've always wanted the best for you, love.<eos> Look, it's not about what we want, Georgie. It's about what you want, now.<eos> What do you want, Georgie?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - Yes you do.
Uh... aspiring writer kid who wrote me some letters a couple years ago.<eos> Wanted to know about the chemicals used in MK-ULTRA.<eos> So you sent him the new chemical?<eos> Callie made a batch.<eos> Each batch is different.<eos> But, yeah.<eos> Uh, he asked nicely, using his real name, so we acquired him some.<eos> Well, James is missing, probably dead.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I did not.
Hackus cat-fishing.<eos> Caught a big one.<eos> And round 12 goes to the Naughties.<eos> Well said, my dim brother.<eos> Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.<eos> It was a trap.<eos> - Very amusing, my little Naughties.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Did we please you, Father?<eos> No, no, you didn't.
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.<eos> - But Smurfette would never tell.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - Never.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Smurfette could never be tricked into being one of them.<eos> Hey, Smurfette.<eos> Did you do this with your sisters back in Smurf Village?<eos> Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.<eos> Well, you do now.
I was doing a little thinking myself.<eos> Master Winslow, it's hard for me, but, well, can I ask you some advice?<eos> I mean, papa to Papa.<eos> It's about Smurfette.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I turned her blue.<eos> I taught her love and kindness.<eos> But the truth is, Gargamel made her.<eos> She's only a Smurf as long as she chooses to be.<eos> But what if she doesn't?
Scott Henderson.<eos> Charles, do you know this man?<eos> He's my uncle.<eos> And you two beautiful ladies are--<eos> Miss Carol.<eos> Nice to meet you. And this is Miss Dougan.<eos> Join us!<eos> Juice?<eos> Excuse me, but you have to have a visitor's badge in order to eat lunch with a student.<eos> I do.
Sleep well.<eos> I'll take this.<eos> I don't want to hear any more noise.<eos> Three weeks and two days.<eos> It is the custom.<eos> I wonder what you will do without me.<eos> I won't stay idle.<eos> Darling, it's good money.<eos> If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.<eos> You don't.
Yes, sir.<eos> You cultivate cane previously?<eos> No, sir, I have not.<eos> It comes to you quite naturally.<eos> Are you educated?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Niggers are hired to work, not read or write.<eos> You play the fiddle.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, I do.
How came you here?<eos> Master Bass... if justice had been done, I never would have been here.<eos> How's this?<eos> Tell me all.<eos> I'm afraid to tell you.<eos> Every word you speak is a profound secret.<eos> Your story... it is amazing.<eos> And in no good way.<eos> Do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?<eos> I do.
You stop that now.<eos> That's enough!<eos> You know that's the way it go.<eos> You want to eat, I'm gonna have to work.<eos> I'm gonna come for you as soon as I can.<eos> You want to be a spoiled child, then?<eos> Please, Papa, can I have one?<eos> One what?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> Yes, you did!
- I did at first.<eos> - You be careful!<eos> - I wasn't.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - I thought you were.<eos> I thought that...<eos> I wasn't worried, it was him!<eos> I thought you believed it at first.<eos> No, I didn't.
I was helping a colleague vomiting on your stairs.<eos> Who else is sick?<eos> My wife.<eos> This way.<eos> Careful as you go in. It's round.<eos> - Have you been playing Duke Ellington?<eos> You've had it, too?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> You know "Slap Happy"?<eos> You do.
Chloe, there's a problem with your lung.<eos> There is something...<eos> Mr. Colin?<eos> Hold on...<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Something in your lung, to be precise.<eos> The droxylophomase I prescribed caused a reaction.<eos> I've scared you.<eos> Yes I did .
It even smells like a hospital here.<eos> She's lost in thought about something.<eos> The others - other than him - know nothing.<eos> He knows, but cannot change a thing.<eos> What do you think?<eos> The torrent of perceptions presents us with endless possibilities for the associative process.<eos> Perhaps a few will manifest themselves as phenomena.<eos> Most, typically, remain unremarked, though may result in feeling not unlike the conscious state.<eos> Does this trouble you?<eos> It does.
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be alone.<eos> Andie, you're not.<eos> Oh, come on, you know what I mean.<eos> You're gonna find somebody one day.<eos> I know it.<eos> How do you know it?<eos> God.<eos> I just do.

- Fewer and fewer.<eos> This is family.<eos> His nephew, Georgie, is engaged to a girl whose motherjust passed.<eos> I don't know if that's family.<eos> He likes funerals.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday.<eos> I was so pissed at Mel.<eos> You didn't forget to pick up your mail.<eos> - I did.
Are you okay?<eos> I'm just a harbinger, that's all.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Crispus, this is a bad idea.<eos> These are the best ideas usually.<eos> There he goes. Oh, boy.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> It requires a lot of confidence to do what you do.<eos> To believe in her.<eos> Not that what you do?
All right? I didn't just leave to go play baseball, you know?<eos> Being a father scared the crap out of me.<eos> But I've changed, Emma.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Wait, Emma.<eos> Emma, stop.<eos> I want to be his father.<eos> Really?<eos> Really you want to be his father, Cory?<eos> Yes, I do.
- No! I just...<eos> - I told you, I'm a cat lover. - I love cats.<eos> - I know.<eos> You're upsetting Shadow.<eos> - For God's sake...<eos> - Shadow's upset now.<eos> Where are they?<eos> The diamonds?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Well, Martin is in the hospital, he needs surgery right away.<eos> Listen, they offered me to fight Cage Fury, the MMA World Champion, $100,000 in three weeks.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Of course my wife doesn't want me to do it, but I have to do it.<eos> It's the only way out for me.<eos> You have to do it. Gia doesn't want you to?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you have to understand that she loves you.<eos> She doesn't want to see hurt.<eos> Nobody does Hector.
He's a wrecking machine.<eos> The only way you can beat him is with speed, agility and combinations.<eos> That's what we got to focus on.<eos> So I stay out of his reach.<eos> Come and do the damage, and leave.<eos> Cause if he hits you one time, game over.<eos> Yeah, he's a monster.<eos> I'm not fighting the monster, I'm fighting the man.<eos> I'm pretty sure he has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
There are 3 conditions that determine the status of a conscientious objector.<eos> The Appeals Board ruled that Ali did not meet any of them.<eos> But the Appeals Board was not specific, Chief.<eos> It did not say which conditions it rejected.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Griswold challenged Ali on only one condition.<eos> He conceded the other two.<eos> In fact, he said that he found Ali to be sincere and that his objections were religiously based.<eos> So, how do we know that the one condition that Griswold singled out was the same one that the Appeal Board used to hang Ali out to dry?<eos> We don't.
Not you.<eos> You see me and see me.<eos> You're the only, who really knows me.<eos> All other see in me Only one trophy.<eos> You are that.<eos> - You are the true trophy, Artie.<eos> Ah, that's so gay.<eos> - Muzzle.<eos> Now you can call me kiss, if you want.<eos> I do not.
Just come home, please.<eos> Please.<eos> Oh, you're such a good guy.<eos> And I really hope you find a nice girl.<eos> What are you saying to me?<eos> I feel so dead with you, Brice.<eos> I do.<eos> And I wanna feel alive.<eos> I wanna feel wanted.<eos> I don't.
Here's water, drink it.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What the hell's goin' on?<eos> Do you people know each other?<eos> You just need to breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hey!<eos> Who are you, man?<eos> I don't remember who I am.<eos> None of us do.
Uh, you know, this would be so much easier if you had even a little bit of cleavage.<eos> Maybe Carrie will have something that fits better.<eos> Good idea.<eos> You're both shrimp-toids.<eos> Hello?<eos> Crisis.<eos> My clothes don't fit mouse.<eos> Could it be because you're 5 inches taller?<eos> I keep forgetting how long-legged I am.<eos> No, you don't.
Obviously, I couldn't take her home to her parents.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She's... kind of baked.<eos> Do you have any chips?<eos> I really need something crunchy.<eos> Yeah, inside.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I got this.<eos> Um... she's never been stoned before. Did you know that?<eos> I did not.
Hey, Sebastian?<eos> Thanks again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No problemo, Bradshaw.<eos> See you around.<eos> I realized then that I couldn't demonize him as someone selfish.<eos> He did care about other people.<eos> The truth was Sebastian and I weren't that far apart, except that now... we were.<eos> He's got a really cute butt!<eos> Yes, he does.
You're my only student who's more concerned with her grades than... well, anything.<eos> Does that mean you'll take my extra credit?<eos> No.<eos> It just means you get the benefit of the doubt.<eos> You'll have to keep the B-Plus.<eos> You were late turning in the assignment.<eos> But I worked so hard on it.<eos> You might wanna minimize your losses and just be happy you aren't being sent to the principal.<eos> This will never happen again.<eos> - Until it does.
- I'm here patrolling the dance, Maggie.<eos> God, I wish I wasn't the one to have to tell you this.<eos> Donna's trying to hurt us.<eos> "We" don't exist anymore.<eos> - So now what?<eos> - Now you're my boyfriend.<eos> You do like her, right?<eos> I know you like her.<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wow.<eos> Good grades and sports. Zoinks.<eos> So what if he's in three sports?<eos> He's not that tall.<eos> How good could he be?<eos> He's the best point guard Castlebury's ever had.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> School newspaper. Don't you read it?<eos> Did you know he takes his math courses<eos> I did not.
I'm here every Saturday.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I'm here with the "for the blind bake sale"<eos> every weekend, and you're never here.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I run the meals over to the senior citizen home on Saturdays, always.<eos> So you're also a do-gooder.<eos> Why are you suddenly so interested in me?<eos> Up until that Rubik's cube, you didn't even know I existed.<eos> Well, now I do.

That sounds nice.<eos> Oh, yeah. And Molly Ringwald is coming.<eos> That's great.<eos> Earth to Mags. What's going on?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Come on. I know when something's up.<eos> You get that look.<eos> I don't get a look.<eos> You do.
Muscles and guys punching each other?<eos> Mr. T.?<eos> (Laughs) Yes, please.<eos> - Okay. - (Chuckles)<eos> You're a really nice guy, Walt.<eos> Really thoughtful.<eos> Just doin' my job.<eos> Or the job you made me do.<eos> I hope Maggie knows how special you are.<eos> She does.
The question is, what are you going to do now?<eos> Eat a grilled cheese.<eos> Don't be obtuse.<eos> I mean with Carrie.<eos> You do like her, right?<eos> I know you like her.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
(Sighs) I just... I wanted to apologize.<eos> After I left and I calmed down, I felt pretty stupid, yelling at you like that.<eos> I mean, it turns out all I needed to relax was a cheeseburger.<eos> So... (Smacking) (Chuckles)<eos> That's very funny.<eos> What's funny?<eos> I'm... giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are making a joke based on our last interaction.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't?
Oh, we went to the same private school for a bit.<eos> The one I got kicked out of for pot smokin'.<eos> So, uh, Miller isn't in our grade?<eos> Actually a senior.<eos> So Dorrit's with someone older than us?<eos> Miller's all right.<eos> He's super smart, but he doesn't really care much about it.<eos> Or anything. And he's exactly Dorrit's type, and I don't mean that in a good way.<eos> Shs seems happy.<eos> She does.
Just... No matter what, it seems like we end up here.<eos> Because you wanna overthink every moment.<eos> Or because you don't want to think at all.<eos> I mean, you smoke pot with Donna to let loose.<eos> You got drunk at that book party because you were upset about your mom.<eos> I'm trying to cope, okay?<eos> So am I, every day.<eos> Look, I know it's complicated for us. Between us.<eos> But that doesn't mean it's not worth it.<eos> Maybe it does.
I mean, he seemed pretty happy about it.<eos> But it pretty much obliterated the whole "I love you" thing.<eos> I can't believe i did that.<eos> I mean, i have dreamt of my first "I love you"- when the guy would say it, who would it be?<eos> I mean, i imagined my first "I love you" would be perfect, and now i don't have to imagine it anymore.<eos> Apparently, i don't say it back.<eos> There's still time, Carrie.<eos> But i ruined the perfect.<eos> Do you not love him?<eos> No, i do.
He's a sheep, not a leader!<eos> I'm a leader.<eos> I've already joined and run for president of eight clubs.<eos> This week, i'm taking the rest.<eos> - That sounds horrible.<eos> - Exactly!<eos> Which is why i'm sure to land officer roles in all of them.<eos> And while i'm busy attending all my meetings, I can also be avoiding that totally hot but duplicitous West.<eos> Looks like you've got everything under control.<eos> I do!
Just lie here and be distracted.<eos> It's not going to happen, buster.<eos> I have things to do.<eos> It figures you'd be reading a book about cancer.<eos> Ms. Doom and gloom and her sister tiny dancer.<eos> Not that i care what you think, but it's a book about sex.<eos> Well... color me interested.<eos> A book about sex and an outfit that doesn't scream "Hate me. "<eos> Does little Bradshaw have a man?<eos> You do.
I'm saying it because i have to.<eos> Why do you have to think so much about everything?<eos> Because that's who i am, and obviously you don't like that or the choices i make or what's important to me,<eos> So if that's the way you feel, then maybe we should just break up.<eos> Once again, i had lost control of my mouth.<eos> I could only hope Sebastian was in control of his.<eos> Well, if that's what you want, fine.<eos> It's always about what you want, anyway.<eos> I never even told him i love him, Mouse.<eos> And i do... so much.
Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello!<eos> Oh, I thought you'd gone.<eos> Well, we were so impressed with the hotel, we thought,<eos> "Why not treat ourselves to a couple of nights?"<eos> Why not indeed.<eos> Now, we quite like the 20th floor.<eos> I'm guessing you've got a few vacancies up there.<eos> Actually, we do.
What do you want to talk about?<eos> Has one of you been naughty?<eos> No, no.<eos> Actually, um, we just want...<eos> OK. Let's relax.<eos> Whew. Isn't this cosy?<eos> Yes, it's a lovely... lovely room.<eos> Now, I can sense that you two love each other very much.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We do.
Here we go.<eos> It's like digging for treasure.<eos> You don't know what it's gonna be, but you know it's gonna be great. Ah, ha ha ha.<eos> There we go.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Shouldn't you wash that under a tap? Nah.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I know where we're going.<eos> No, you don't have to go.<eos> No, I do.
You used him?<eos> The police are on their way.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> You... you don't understand.<eos> He was scum.<eos> Ask anyone.<eos> And he didn't even care what he'd done.<eos> He didn't care what I'd been through.<eos> We understand. Don't we, Charlie?<eos> We do. We do.
You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> You... you don't understand.<eos> He was scum.<eos> Ask anyone.<eos> And he didn't even care what he'd done.<eos> He didn't care what I'd been through.<eos> We understand. Don't we, Charlie?<eos> We do. We do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No-one does.
It doesn't matter.<eos> The point is, whoever Derek was blackmailing is probably the person who killed him.<eos> - And Theresa.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> Hmm? Ethan?<eos> Emma?<eos> If it wasn't you, why are you freaking out?<eos> You need to tell me.<eos> Do they know who was being blackmailed?<eos> Do you?
Because I don't wanna let them down.<eos> By dying?<eos> By leaving before they're ready.<eos> I wanna make sure all my loose ends are tied up.<eos> I wanna make sure there's a plan in place, so everyone will be okay.<eos> And what about you?<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Well, you.<eos> Where do you fit into this plan?<eos> I don't.
Because I thought it would be fun!<eos> Maybe we'd see another falling star.<eos> You wished on one for a bike once.<eos> And mom got you that blue ten-speed for Christmas, remember?<eos> And they never got us anything good.<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> - What?<eos> The last time you grew out your beard was for ultimate frisbee in college.<eos> You spent two years looking like a freak because you thought, if you shaved, your team would lose.<eos> And we didn't, for two whole years.
- What?<eos> The last time you grew out your beard was for ultimate frisbee in college.<eos> You spent two years looking like a freak because you thought, if you shaved, your team would lose.<eos> And we didn't, for two whole years.<eos> Look.<eos> You're caught up in some superstitious O.C.D. thing, and it's not gonna work for me.<eos> I'm dying, Sean.<eos> And growing beards and wishing on shooting stars is not gonna change that.<eos> Y... you don't know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But if I have to stay here and wait for God to decide when he's ready to let me go, why does it have to be so painful?<eos> Your illness is not just to test you, but to test the charity of others.<eos> Have you seen generosity and kindness in the people around you?<eos> Well, we believe that beauty and the knowledge of that goodness is Allah.<eos> We believe it's God.<eos> We're not sure.<eos> Oh, lord Jesus Christ, most merciful lord of earth, we ask that you receive this child into your arms, that she may pass in safety from this crisis.<eos> As thou hast told us with infinite compassion, let not your heart be troubled.<eos> Ye believe in God, believe also in me.<eos> [Exhales deeply] How you doing, Adam?
But the truth is... you did your best, I think.<eos> I know you loved us.<eos> [Chuckles] I mean, I wish you could've said it more, but I know.<eos> And in the end, you only raise yourself, right?<eos> And I'm pretty happy where I ended up.<eos> I have a wonderful son.<eos> You haven't see him since he was a little boy.<eos> And God knows I haven't been the perfect parent, but I try.<eos> I try and teach him some of the things you taught me...<eos> And a lot of the things you didn't.
Cleaning and shit.<eos> Well, one day last week, I sneak in a few pops on the job, get a little loaded, and fall asleep behind some crates.<eos> I wake up around midnight, hearing things.<eos> I peek out and there's the boss himself and that weird, quiet dude with the bow ties carrying something wrapped up in a tarp.<eos> I hid while they fed it to the shredder.<eos> And when they left, I found that down in the blood gutter.<eos> I kept it.<eos> Kind of like insurance.<eos> - You saw Proctor himself?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
We didn't think about security, not here.<eos> Colin Yule was... wandering around upstairs a little earlier.<eos> The Film Society guy. Where exactly?<eos> I just saw him in the corridor.<eos> What do you know about Eve Lomax, Mrs Davenport?<eos> Eve Lomax?<eos> The woman who was murdered yesterday?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But you knew she was writing a book about you and your sister?<eos> No, I didn't.
Luckily for us, since it turned out we couldn't have children of our own.<eos> Who is Emma's father?<eos> He was a tutor at my drama school.<eos> Does he know what happened to the baby?<eos> I told him she'd been adopted.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Dead, probably.<eos> He was a good deal older than me, smoked like a chimney.<eos> And Eve Lomax worked all this out from that photograph.<eos> As did you.
Aw, shit.<eos> Just what do you think this is?<eos> A goddamn hotel? !<eos> Put the gun down right there on the box.<eos> - Mister Sanderson...<eos> - Do as I say, boy!<eos> Hurry.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I thought you said you knew this guy?<eos> I do.
We're no longer the same.<eos> Let's go get 'em.<eos> - We don't even understand this yet.<eos> - We don't have time to.<eos> Look, we get them before they get us, and they won't becatching up with anybody.<eos> But if we hurt them, maybe we'll be hurting ourselves.<eos> That's a chance I'm willing to take.<eos> Ah, there it is.<eos> I don't have all the answers.<eos> I don't. I don't.
- Why?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> I would love to come in for an interview. Oh... Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah, I could get there in half an hour.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Just sayin' hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - We done?
I'm really a great success in life.<eos> Above you can see that I have my big boxes, my oversize clamshells.<eos> Things like that.<eos> Um...<eos> I have things alphabetical, to keep things simple.<eos> The way I've done it, is color.<eos> Because to me it looks the most aesthetically pleasing.<eos> I just tried doing it in a Roy G Biv kind of way.<eos> And just came all the way down to black and white.<eos> I also do my books that way.
B.T. dubs, I'm kind of obsessed with Monopoly.<eos> In high school, I once had a backseat quickie with a guy just 'cause his name was Marvin Gardens.<eos> Anyway, the point is, I played Monopoly so much, that all the kids called me community chest.<eos> Are you sure that's why they called...<eos> Dude, just let me have that one. Ooh!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> You remember last week when you got all drunk and you told her that you loved her?<eos> Nope.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course I do.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm so touched that you came.<eos> I'm sorry about Vivian.<eos> We're on.<eos> Here we go.<eos> How have you been Joanna?<eos> What have you done with your life?<eos> Things haven't turned out. Quite the way I thought they would.<eos> They never do.
No.<eos> I'm not still a lesbian.<eos> You sure?<eos> I once kissed Mary Straily when I was at Ms. Porter's school.<eos> But it wasn't for me.<eos> Well...<eos> Do you know about all this?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No I-I didn't.
- I'll drive.<eos> No, you stay here.<eos> Help with the fortifications.<eos> I'll take Maggie.<eos> You sure she's up to that?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> We need to find out how the walkers are getting into the tombs.<eos> Are we gonna talk about this?<eos> Maggie, you need to talk about it.<eos> I do? Or you do?
Hey, I think that's me.<eos> "Aargh!" And that's what he basically says he did.<eos> It's almost like jumping off a building. And then you lived.<eos> You fucked up. But you lived.<eos> I tried to commit suicide.<eos> Intentionally?<eos> That's all I want to say.<eos> Next question.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Yes, it did.
- We're different people.<eos> - I'm not a scientist, Jason.<eos> I'm just a guy who's helped scores of people learn how to deal...<eos> Coming through.<eos> With multiple personalities.<eos> And the fundamental lesson-- the one that you refuse to hear is this-- you and Ian are part of a whole.<eos> You need to work together if you're ever gonna peacefully coexist.<eos> How can I do that?<eos> I don't know anything about stolen cars and drug money.<eos> Yes, you do.

Chandan..<eos> Chandan..<eos> Did someone call?<eos> Could be Shubhangi.<eos> Go check on her. She was so high.<eos> Go Chandan..<eos> I will go and see.. Yeah..<eos> I will go. Hmm..<eos> It wasn't an imagination Chandan.. You did not see things.<eos> I did?
No.. I know.. I am not.<eos> You are inviting trouble man.. .<eos> Can't you see? You are just inviting trouble into your life..<eos> I am telling it was right Elena.. it was correct.<eos> Why do you want to repeat the Shubhangi chapter bro?<eos> You know I had this girl friend called Shubhangi..<eos> And she could never get her name right.<eos> How stupid is that?<eos> I am sure you kept troubling her all the time.. -to get it correct..<eos> No, I never did that.
No, I never did that.<eos> I never do that.<eos> Hello.. Hello.. you here?<eos> Yea.<eos> Your landlady tortured me just for a key.<eos> By the way.. you know lam not your girl friend. Of course.. you are not.<eos> Well, I thought I will just clarify.<eos> Because you referred to your ex-girl friend.<eos> And then you talked about me..<eos> Good you did that.
Which is that I have a question to ask..<eos> "But I won't be able to ask.<eos> I mean.. did you really kiss Elena..<eos> I don't want to know, I don't want answers..<eos> I won't be able to ask.<eos> Ask me the day you can, and I will tell you.<eos> That day she looked agreeable An'i.<eos> Do you feel like jumping?<eos> But I think she loves me.<eos> She does.
They also taught me when to cut loose.<eos> I don't remember the part of the plan where you get all intense and creepy again.<eos> You are so much more than your father.<eos> And you could be greater still if you would let go.<eos> Dude, I'm not exactly a fan, but do yourself a favor and zip it.<eos> What are we doing here, Tiger?<eos> I'm going to finish it. Finish him!<eos> He took my father from me. Forever!<eos> - You don't know how that feels.<eos> - I do, actually.
I can imagine Louise backing out because of what happened in the past towards you.<eos> I imagine it felt scary having to meet you, not knowing what you'd do to her.<eos> I'm only speaking for myself, but if I had to guess, maybe that's why.<eos> Look, I spoke to Linda on the phone before coming here. So if you tell me I was mean to you, then I give in completely.<eos> Because... I know I could be a bit of a wind-up back then.<eos> So if you say I was nasty to you, then I hold my hands up.<eos> You weren't at the latest reunion.<eos> Was that a deliberate decision?<eos> I wasn't... I never got an invitation.<eos> - Sure you did.
Henrik!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How's life?<eos> - Good. You?<eos> Well, it's Friday, nearly the weekend. It is the weekend.<eos> - So, how's the film going?<eos> - It's going really well.<eos> - Do you have time for a quick chat?<eos> - No, actually I don't.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.<eos> We're not trying to play to the balcony.<eos> Just talk normal.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> - I assume that's our bust line.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Start hiring writers.<eos> So I'm in the middle of breakfast this morning, and I get a call from FBI ops asking why they haven't been informed that we're running a reverse on a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> Imagine my surprise since I didn't know we had a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> We don't.
I mean, what's your take?<eos> My take?<eos> My take is I'll take it.<eos> I'll take it and make it my own.<eos> Oh, oh, I-I get it.<eos> You know, story's really never been your thing, right?<eos> You're all about voice and attitude, lots of talk, no action.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So we both know what this is about.<eos> - We do?
It is untouched by man.<eos> But... I mean, do you-- how do you--did you--<eos> Oh--what?<eos> Oh, how do I take care of myself?<eos> Marcy, I do exactly that.<eos> I take care of myself.<eos> I don't need a fucking man to make me come.<eos> I come all the time.<eos> I just came right now.<eos> - Seriously, you just did?
She gave me a hug and she wrote inside my book.<eos> She said "Love, Selena."<eos> Lucy, if this meant so much to you, why didn't you just ask me to take you?<eos> You normally ask my permission to do things like this.<eos> Well, usually, you're not acting so weird.<eos> You think I'm acting weird?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You would never have let me cut school anyway.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Honestly, I hope they starve to death.<eos> Yeah, seriously, then we can get some sleep up in this bitch.<eos> So I go to this party and Scott's like, "You should totally rush."<eos> And I'm like, "That's retarded.<eos> "That's for idiots who were stupid enough to go to Dartmouth."<eos> I'm on a hunger strike.<eos> You're one of them, I can tell.<eos> Or I'm just not hungry.<eos> Or you secretly want to starve yourself.<eos> Duh, what girl doesn't?
Hello. This is kind of embarrassing,<eos> - but...<eos> - Jake, what are you doing? !<eos> Are you really standing up in front of everyone and singing to prove your love for Marley?<eos> - Yes, Ryder.<eos> Yes, I am. - Wow.<eos> That's so crazy and emotionally vulnerable.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Yes, I did.
You and Blaine did used to sing that duet together, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it feels like a lifetime ago.<eos> Maybe that's what's hard about it.<eos> You still love him, don't you?<eos> Was I your rebound? No.<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause I can't compete with a fantasy, Kurt.<eos> I desperately want to be over him.<eos> Really, I do.
* I just want to tell you that I had enough * * One desire<eos> * Tell me why * It might sound crazy<eos> * But it ain't no lie, baby, bye, bye, bye * * I want it that way<eos> * Bye, bye.<eos> Well, the love on the stage is obvious.<eos> You two bros need to just hug it out.<eos> I'm in.<eos> What do you say, Mr. Shue?<eos> I-I want to, Finn.<eos> I-I really do, I just...
* And I get emotional * Inside<eos> * I know it's crazy * But you still can touch * My heart<eos> * And after all this time<eos> * You'd think that I<eos> * Wouldn't feel the same<eos> * But time melts into nothing * And nothing's changed<eos> * I still believe * That someday you and me<eos> * Will find ourselves * In love again<eos> * Oh, baby, yeah * I still believe *<eos> * Baby, I do * Someday you and me *
They're the band.<eos> And...<eos> Oh, my... God.<eos> If I know you the way I think I do, you're gonna love it even more after.<eos> ♪ It's a little bit funny ♪<eos> ♪ This feeling inside ♪<eos> ♪ I'm not one of those ♪<eos> ♪ Who can easily hide ♪<eos> ♪ Don't have much money but, boy ♪<eos> ♪ If I did ♪
I have, like, the best taste.<eos> Is this him?<eos> No. Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, he wants to do me, but we're just friends.<eos> Sam.<eos> Jan.<eos> Would you excuse us for just a moment?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I don't.
You only get one true love of your life.<eos> And you are mine, Emma.<eos> And I promise you that as long as you just keep being you and-and let me love you, I will be the happiest man alive.<eos> And can we just skip to the "I do" part because I can't...<eos> I can't spend one more minute without being this woman's husband.<eos> Works for me.<eos> I have a reservation at Breadstix, too.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> Emma, do you take Will to be your husband, to love and honor, forsaking all others from this day forward?<eos> I do.

Please.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> You know they're just here to keep us safe.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Deva, I'm sorry about all this.<eos> Why would she lie to us?<eos> Everything's not going to be all right, is it?<eos> I don't know, honey.<eos> I honestly don't.
-100,000 us dollars.<eos> I need the money, I'm begging you.<eos> I only have one hour left.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> I don't believe anyone anymore.<eos> And you don't piss holy water.<eos> They're my kids. Please.<eos> I'll pay you back!<eos> - I don't have that kind of cash.<eos> - Yes, you do.
We didn't speak much.<eos> I'll see how things turn out.<eos> Be more self-conscious, yes, I know, darling, but...<eos> Agreed.<eos> I kiss you goodnight.<eos> It's prettier with a sandbox and a swing.<eos> I liked it more before.<eos> You know there's been a murder here?<eos> Does that ring a bell?<eos> It does.
- You're sick.<eos> - Nah, nah.<eos> - Maybe I should see a psychiatrist? - Get off me.<eos> I think you should see a psychiatrist.<eos> - You're my psychiatrist.<eos> - Oh, God forbid.<eos> You know, what even gets me more turned on?<eos> When you start lighting those fires everywhere.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You don't?
Come on, come on.<eos> - Get off me.<eos> - No, here.<eos> Here.<eos> Then in the hallway.<eos> We'll finish at the kitchen.<eos> Say, who's this Henri you invited?<eos> Somebody told you about him?<eos> No, he called to see what time the barbecue started.<eos> - He did?
He's this teacher at the school.<eos> He will be a teacher.<eos> He has his exams soon and he's been giving me private lessons.<eos> - Private lessons?<eos> - Math lessons, Mom.<eos> Fine.<eos> You have condoms, at least?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What?<eos> We do the lessons at school, in study hall.
What?<eos> Hot corn!<eos> Fouad, stop it!<eos> Here.<eos> Give him this.<eos> Careful.<eos> Here.<eos> - I don't want any.<eos> - You cut your hand!<eos> No, I didn't.
Come on, get up.<eos> Where's your jacket?<eos> I won't go.<eos> I don't want to go back tonight.<eos> I'll call her and you talk to her.<eos> Marie-Anne?<eos> Hold on, please.<eos> I'm staying here tonight.<eos> Why did you hang up?<eos> She did.
Once upon a time, till was pure as the snow.<eos> But she drifted.<eos> She's a little long in the tooth for you, but a desperate woman ain't choosy.<eos> Don't let these hussies taunt you, Jimmy.<eos> Wouldn't know a real man if he fell from the sky atop them. Mm-hmm.<eos> Soon be time for the husking' bee, won't it?<eos> No husking' bee for us.<eos> Huskin' bee for everybody else, but not for us.<eos> You recall when we set up a ring of big pumpkins over at the seymours' place... And we all sat on 'em under the moonlight, and old Lem hornbeck played his fiddle... And we all danced and danced and sang all the night?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's okay.<eos> How you've grown!<eos> I'm still waiting for my prosthetic arm.<eos> Your arm?<eos> Daddy is getting a new right arm.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> My right arm's itchy.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> You have saké?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Running away.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> - Running away from mummy.<eos> Saw it straight away.<eos> I can tell.<eos> You've done your bad deeds, looking for glory.<eos> A man's deeds, and now you're running.<eos> Don't you ever do that again.<eos> If you had any sense, you'd run back to mummy.<eos> But you don't.
What have you done, Bobo?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I was doing this for both of us.<eos> I swear on the Devil...<eos> I will return.<eos> I will return.<eos> I will come back for you.<eos> 4... 3... 2... 1.<eos> So doctor, do you believe in witches and spirits?<eos> Yes, I do.
He showed the most promise.<eos> In his own way, I think Edward suffered as much as Vivian did.<eos> Dime a point, double for a schneid.<eos> I don't want the nine.<eos> He doesn't seem to have any fight left in him, and that's what breaks my heart.<eos> Now his marriage is crumbling.<eos> Aw, that's sad.<eos> Crumbling marriage.<eos> Do you want me to talk to Samantha?<eos> II do.
I think you ought to start worrying about-<eos> Good, you got the new reports.<eos> Let's get these old ones off the table.<eos> Catherine, Catherine, you'll sit over there.<eos> Not at the table?<eos> What about my presentation?<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> You just observe and don't say anything.<eos> But sir, I have some really good ideas as to how-<eos> No, no you don't.
Okay, what can I do?<eos> You could make us some sandwiches.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> Hey Luke, dude, come here, I want you to check this out.<eos> Does it have anything to do with you exploiting my wife's death to give your company a name?<eos> No. That's what I heard from the pastor.<eos> That's not what's going on, okay?<eos> You know about this?<eos> Yes, I do.
I wanted to talk to you about something. I was gonna tell you about it yesterday but I kind of, you know, lost track of-<eos> Okay, well, let me just say<eos> I wanted to wait 'til we gotn the day behind us but I think we should date, formally.<eos> You do?<eos> Don't you?<eos> Well, yes, sure.<eos> I just--that's not what I was gonna say, is the thing.<eos> - It's not?<eos> - No. I was gonna tell you that I quit my job.<eos> - You did?
Previously on Fringe...<eos> I got called to a crime scene outside the city.<eos> I saw Etta for the first time.<eos> She recruited me in the resistance, taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts.<eos> Who is the Dove?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Nobody does!
How could he do this for you-- enable you to see a life you didn't live?<eos> I'm not sure, but I feel it.<eos> Do you remember the plan?<eos> No.<eos> No idea.<eos> But that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would he give you back all of those memories, but not give you the plan?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Peter, before I met him, I didn't think it was possible to love you more, but now, knowing what we've been through, and everything we've had...<eos> I do.
I want you to give Olivia your daughter back.<eos> I want to give you your life back.<eos> As a father, how could I not do that for you?<eos> What I said on the tape about stealing time with you, I meant it.<eos> I wouldn't trade it for the world.<eos> You are my favorite thing, Peter.<eos> My very favorite thing.<eos> Where's the logbook?<eos> You left it in the car.<eos> No, I didn't.
You're gonna wear that fishing?<eos> No, I'm wearing this to work.<eos> I thought you were taking time off. I did.<eos> Two whole days.<eos> What, Saturday and Sunday?<eos> That's a weekend.<eos> Everyone takes that off.<eos> Yeah, you guys know how it is.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> No, you don't. Okay.
One died.<eos> Make that 11.<eos> Henry.<eos> She was 98 years old, all right?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Another one-night stand, Jimmy?<eos> You and her?<eos> You had sex with her?<eos> Did you?<eos> You didn't.
It's fine.<eos> Another one-night stand, Jimmy?<eos> You and her?<eos> You had sex with her?<eos> Did you?<eos> You didn't.<eos> Did you?<eos> Did you?<eos> Damn it!<eos> You did?
You and her?<eos> You had sex with her?<eos> Did you?<eos> You didn't.<eos> Did you?<eos> Did you?<eos> Damn it!<eos> You did?<eos> You didn't, did you?<eos> No, you didn't, did you?
I don't want Him.<eos> I want you.<eos> Who do you think he is?<eos> Are you saying that one day he gives himself to God, the next he's a thief and a savage?<eos> I'm just telling you, the evidence against him is strong.<eos> Well, it can't be right.<eos> A bottle of medicine was stolen from the cow shed where the cow was mutilated.<eos> John Middleton has that bottle.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
Get them on your feet.<eos> Ah Francis, look at those.<eos> They were made for you.<eos> Mr Eyre, grab hold of those.<eos> What's that for, sir?<eos> This tells people that I'm ready... that I'm not a shirker.<eos> You sound like Lord Kitchener.<eos> Good.<eos> Did you get a letter, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
I didn't mean that anyway.<eos> 'Cause dinosaurs-- obviously, there's some dinosaurs that still exist, so that would only be going back, like, 10 years or whatever.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Dinosaurs still exist?<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> I know some people still think they don't exist, right?<eos> - Some people don't think--<eos> - Some people don't.
I'll give you a hundred bucks if we can go undercover.<eos> Kendrick Mantorov is either your killer or a possible target.<eos> - Getting close to him makes sense.<eos> - Makes sense.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> All right.<eos> Here we go, Wanda. Excuse me.<eos> Buck and Wanda Moosejaw.<eos> - We want to dance to the top.<eos> - Yeah, everybody does.
The next exhalation, Chaturanga dandasana, inclined plane...<eos> Bring your elbows together, raise your knees, raise your thighs.<eos> Bring your palms together.<eos> There...<eos> Tilt your head back, let it fall back.<eos> Open your spiritual heart, bring it back with humility, so that it's as parallel with the floor as possible.<eos> And rest on your heels.<eos> Well done, Gloria.<eos> - Did you like it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- To your birthday.<eos> - Happy birthday, son.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - And cheers...<eos> - Happy birthday, little brother.<eos> - To your pregnancy.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Oh, you didn't know.<eos> - No, I didn't.
If Jens had gone out on lime plain - They had found him. It certainly is.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can I see that?<eos> - The postmark in Borgholm.<eos> - No return address.<eos> And no letter.<eos> Can it really be he who.?<eos> They looked exactly like this.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Yes, he did.
Skye.<eos> Skye.<eos> Skye?<eos> Welcome, Skye.<eos> There's no need for that.<eos> We're all friends here.<eos> There's nowhere to go, Skye.<eos> Stay a while.<eos> I feel that.<eos> Of course you do.
Well, so can you help her?<eos> We're starting a counteragent protocol that should abrogate the drug's effects.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The rest, of course, is up to her.<eos> Why are you fighting?<eos> You already know.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> This... all of this is a part of me that wants to stop looking for my dad.<eos> So you do want to move on.<eos> No, I don't.
Where's Detective Liette?<eos> She went to go tell Erin we caught Hobart. Why?<eos> Forensics report on the blood from the attack at Erin's apartment.<eos> We'll be in touch to coordinate transport when he's cleared medically.<eos> Daniella, before you go,<eos> - I just wanted to say...<eos> - Detective Black.<eos> I haven't always been supportive about this notion you have about blending psychiatry<eos> - and police work.<eos> - Sean, you don't...
- He wouldn't speak with me.<eos> - He's young.<eos> - He's angry.<eos> What does Arun say about you coming home?<eos> He doesn't... I don't...<eos> - I can't hear you, Mandar.<eos> - He doesn't want me to come home.<eos> But he will change his mind.<eos> Does Ria want you to come home?<eos> - Yes. Yes, she does.
What does Arun say about you coming home?<eos> He doesn't... I don't...<eos> - I can't hear you, Mandar.<eos> - He doesn't want me to come home.<eos> But he will change his mind.<eos> Does Ria want you to come home?<eos> - Yes. Yes, she does.<eos> - What if you hear voices again?<eos> I haven't heard voices in a decade.<eos> What if you do?
- Kazha, could you give us a moment?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Congratulations to you, madame mayor.<eos> It's, uh, very impressive.<eos> Shouldn't you be hobnobbing with the president, making the world a better place?<eos> I am.<eos> Pol Madis needs to be captured.<eos> Sadly, a certain self-proclaimed city-state couldn't hold one man in one small cell.<eos> - Madis had help.<eos> - He did...

I can't believe you haven't started that job yet.<eos> You've been yipping about it for weeks.<eos> I am so nervous.<eos> It's like the first day of school.<eos> You gotta make a good impression.<eos> I mean, what if I can't find anyone to eat lunch with?<eos> I totally know what you mean.<eos> At yolanda's daughter's quinceañera, I was really worried that I wouldn't fit in, either.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I didn't. I really didn't.
- Now?<eos> - Now. Now.<eos> All right, well, if you don't mind talking in my other office.<eos> After you.<eos> All right, so what's troubling you, John?<eos> Don't tell me that juror suicide has you spooked.<eos> Hmm, you heard about it.<eos> Half the people in my office are talking about it.<eos> They think there's a curse, if you believe in that kind of thing.<eos> I don't. You?
But he was very charming and charismatic.<eos> Tell me, did he father any children?<eos> Philomena, Marcia's just told us that Anthony was gay.<eos> Well, I always knew that. But I just wondered if he might be bi-curious.<eos> - Bi-curious? - A lot of nurses I worked with were gay but one of them called Brendan told me he was bi-curious.<eos> I don't think he could make up his mind, Marcia.<eos> He didn't have any children.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did Pete love him?<eos> Yes, he did.
It's crazy.<eos> This one does.<eos> I was...<eos> I was just...<eos> They're so mean.<eos> So are the men they married.<eos> They meaner.<eos> I'm sorry, Dima.<eos> We'll figure out something.<eos> We always do.
Good.<eos> Remember one time you went to SaveMart... it was different.<eos> Maybe you were feeling pretty sad. Saddest you'd ever felt in your entire life.<eos> You parked your car.<eos> What colour car?<eos> Blue?<eos> Two door or four door?<eos> Four door. Why?<eos> What does that matter?<eos> It doesn't.
Look at this.<eos> Stay back. Stay back. Stay back.<eos> All right. All right. All right.<eos> Clear a lane! We got to get the ambulance in here, man.<eos> Help is on the way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ann Dawson.<eos> Detectives.<eos> Do you mind if we take a look in your office?<eos> Yeah, I, uh - - I do.
Oh, bullshit.<eos> You take some time. You think about it.<eos> Till then, you got your wish.<eos> You're riding with a senior guy.<eos> Lucero, right?<eos> First name's Henry.<eos> Just call me Hank.<eos> You transferred in.<eos> You don't know the streets.<eos> I do.
Super Snake.<eos> 2012?<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, really.<eos> Do you know when they made the first Super Snake?<eos> 1967.<eos> You know why they made it?<eos> Yeah. Uh, so Carroll Shelby could, uh, test out new tires. Yeah.<eos> Do you know how many they made?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I guess you're okay then.<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> I'm ready to hit the streets right now.<eos> How you guys holding up?<eos> We're used to him being incapacitated, so...<eos> Hey, when you're done fondling my daughter, come over here, sit down.<eos> I got to ask you something.<eos> How many do I owe you now, man?<eos> You don't owe me shit.<eos> No, I do.
Look! Look at this shit!<eos> Did you assault this man?<eos> No. Okay, yes, a-a little, but he liked it.<eos> That's a lie!<eos> She told me she was a librarian.<eos> We met at the book fair last night.<eos> And, yeah, we screwed, but then she wouldn't let me leave until we did it again and again and again!<eos> You said you the read the Marquis de Sade!<eos> Howard said he read it and he liked it!<eos> I did!
All right.<eos> Right, listen.<eos> As you all know,<eos> I am proper excited about moving into my new house, so I am delighted to say that my party on Saturday night will be my first ever... pool party. Whoo!<eos> Pool party?<eos> Get in there!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> !<eos> Who wants a snakebite?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, dinner was great.<eos> Richard was great.<eos> He was funny and sweet and he wants to take me to Santa Barbara and he wants to tell the girls we're together and...<eos> Oh, you're telling Lucy?<eos> No, I haven't decided.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because it's a huge decision, and I'm not sure if Lucy's ready.<eos> And why are we even talking about Richard right now?<eos> I just saw my dead husband.<eos> - No, you didn't.
No.<eos> Yeah. What happened?<eos> Where's Harry?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Wh... how could you bring him here and not tell me he knew about us?<eos> It was a last-minute thing. Okay?<eos> I didn't expect him to come.<eos> I don't need to explain myself to you. Okay?<eos> I do not owe you anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
- right?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It was not pretty.<eos> Oh, we've had some funny stories.<eos> So why did you stop being a cop? Mm. You know, when you're there every day, you see so much.<eos> And if you don't practice some level of detachment, then you can't up and do it the next day.<eos> You know?<eos> I'm sure you know a little something about that.<eos> I do. Mm.
Wham!<eos> Bam!<eos> Thank you ma'am!<eos> Something like that.<eos> How many girls have you been with?<eos> Around two-three.. hundred.<eos> So, you never fell in love.<eos> - What?<eos> Do I look that type?<eos> You don't.
Yeah... me, too...<eos> I finally saw it.<eos> The cursed video clip.<eos> It was her.<eos> My wife was...<eos> Killed by her!<eos> The cursed video clip... it's her doing!<eos> No, it's not Nagi!<eos> Both she and her mother have evil blood!<eos> No, they don't!
Over us. Over me.<eos> Again.<eos> I'm sorry, excuse me.<eos> We need to use the bugs. To get disinformation to the Russians. Dorn told you that?<eos> I didn't need to be told, Louis.<eos> I was a prosecutor, remember?<eos> When will we do it? I will ask dorn to...<eos> Soon.<eos> I need this to be over.<eos> So do I.
Then what?<eos> Spend the rest of my life hiding from him?<eos> Or worse, waiting for my mother and sisters to be killed?<eos> It's over, Angela.<eos> What about me?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> You go home.<eos> How am I supposed to go home now?<eos> You have a good life!<eos> No, I don't!
Anne-Marie?<eos> Yes, did she tell you about him?<eos> She knows?<eos> That's why she's gone?<eos> Oh, God, no, Louis.<eos> I asked her to run his name months ago.<eos> Where she is today has nothing to do with that.<eos> Well, she never betrayed you.<eos> Good, so how do you know?<eos> Louis, how do you...
It's all right.<eos> I don't want to forget.<eos> Rebecca...<eos> I know.<eos> I saw the light.<eos> Come in.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Sit.<eos> You wanted to know if Genovese had left again?<eos> I did.
Thank you, Dorn.<eos> Can you go faster, please?<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> 36 is angry.<eos> Who's 36?<eos> The Direction Regionale de Police Judiciaire de Paris.<eos> We call it "36"<eos> because of their headquarters' address, and they are very territorial.<eos> We have authorization, though.<eos> We do.
You understand?<eos> Fine.<eos> See what he does?<eos> Come here.<eos> He pushed the body way back there, and then he goes to hide.<eos> So, when Anne-Marie comes in, she's drawn towards the body?<eos> Then he grabs the evidence bag with the shoe and doesn't even look at it.<eos> Like he already knew what was in it.<eos> And who was coming.<eos> He did.
Tickle, tickle, break the pickle. Excellent.<eos> We were listening out there, you know, and you guys were roasting Bill pretty hard.<eos> And he's my mate, so I'm here to tell you to behave, baby, yeah! All right.<eos> We're not worthy of such a great co-worker.<eos> We're not worthy! We're not worthy!<eos> I got it.<eos> Mariska Hargitay.<eos> Mari-ska Hargitay!<eos> Y'all stop! Tickle, tickle, break the pickle.<eos> You already did this.
I can't.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Okay, everyone, I have an announcement!<eos> - This whole thing...<eos> - Bill, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.<eos> Uh, before you make that announcement, you had something else you wanted to say, remember?<eos> You wanted Ders here to admit that Wayne's World is a better movie than Austin Powers, or he'll kill him!<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yes, you did.
What do you mean, nothing?<eos> And Rafa?<eos> What about Rafa? He's dead.<eos> It makes no difference.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Keep this inside me until it turns into a disease?<eos> It wasn't my choice, it was yours!<eos> What do you want?<eos> To go down and tell everyone, right now?<eos> Do you?
Dad?<eos> Smidge?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Dad, this place is a mess.<eos> Are you planning on paying any of these bills any time soon?<eos> Well, you don't live here!<eos> And I got enough on my mind without worrying about that!<eos> Mrs. Novak called.<eos> She said you were yelling at her kid.<eos> She did, huh?
- I came to hear your testimony.<eos> - What for?<eos> I'm your partner.<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> (Juvina): Detective Black?<eos> They're ready for you.<eos> (Woman): State your name for the record.<eos> Aidan Alexander Black.<eos> (Woman): Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
You don't think the brass are just dying to cut me loose?<eos> Not to mention all those young punks that want my job?<eos> Accusations like this stick to guys like me, false or not!<eos> Dad.<eos> - Dad, I'm sorry.<eos> - Well, sorry doesn't cut it.<eos> I love you, but from now on would you please just keep your damn mouth shut? !<eos> I call to the stand Inspector Diane Caligra.<eos> Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Ethan... myself...<eos> Theresa, and the twins.<eos> What are you talking about, twins?<eos> There's another Sutton, and her name's Emma.<eos> See ya, Thayer.<eos> THAYER: Sutton.<eos> Well, this changes everything.<eos> Back in my room, before the sirens, I asked you for the truth.<eos> I... I don't even remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It's nice to appreciate my Mom and dad doing something together.<eos> Old me would've just been thinking of ways to make fun of them. - Oh.<eos> - Oh, it's so squishy. - Oh. Ugh.<eos> And the worst part is, I kind of like it. Thanks a lot, Jerry.<eos> You know what this reminds me of?<eos> The time the bathtub backed up and you made us take showers in there anyway.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> You were the one who said, "oh, handsome vineyard guy"...<eos> "You're so strong, the way you squash those grapes". I never said that.<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
Well, if you're looking for someone to blame, you can just point your fingers at yourself.<eos> If you had fingers, I mean. - [Man] Told you it was too soon.<eos> - [Man 2] It wouldn't have mattered.<eos> [Woman] She's obviously stalling.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> The spell replicator is still capturing mortals.<eos> You have to let me go, so I can save the world, again.<eos> Grab him, get him!<eos> [Man 2] Dominic, the Crystals of Justice recognize you as an esteemed member of WizTech. Do you have any testimony?<eos> I most certainly do.
I don't know why I'm so nervous.<eos> I aced the S.A.Ts.<eos> 750 verbal.<eos> Dalia's real gifted when it comes to testing.<eos> I never sweated 'cause our girls are always out the charts.<eos> Did you know when she was born, she was in a 95% for length.<eos> Waouh. Length. That is the hardest one to nail.<eos> Ah ah! Is that a I'm-glad-it's-over smile, or an I'm-glad-it's-over-and-I-nailed-it smile?<eos> - I feel pretty good about it.<eos> - Yes you do!
It's over.<eos> Let him make a fort with his cereal boxes at breakfast.<eos> He likes that.<eos> We should do this again sometime.<eos> Sometimes seeing your parents act like children makes you realize it's time to grow up.<eos> Mommy, stop.<eos> You're scaring me.<eos> Well, he started it.<eos> - What?<eos> She did. - No.
I love pudding skin so much, my old mom used to make it for me all the time.<eos> My old father and sister would usually give me their skin, too.<eos> Because they love you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll just ask my new black mom to make pudding with skin on it from now on.<eos> Yeah, see, that's not gonna happen.<eos> My parents make what they like, and they like skinless pudding.<eos> Andie MacDowell, what are you doing here?<eos> Fred, wake up. Did you hear that?<eos> I did.
Thanks.<eos> I'm really sorry... about yesterday.<eos> It's possible that I overreacted a little bit.<eos> But you made me think.<eos> I didn't want to, but you made me, like you always do, and I think... that everyone needs to be cheered for, not just us guys.<eos> So... bros?<eos> What's this?<eos> I want you to see how good it feels to run through paper.<eos> I don't want to run through paper.<eos> I did your thing.
Why? Who would want to destroy... my beautiful, beautiful friends?<eos> Who would want robármelos?<eos> Who, tell me who.<eos> What...?<eos> Sam?<eos> I do not believe them.<eos> I can not do that, Sam is my friend!<eos> Why would he want...?<eos> No...<eos> No, I do not.
No, no....<eos> I don't know anything!<eos> Plus I'm forgetful.<eos> It's Barbara, right? Brenda?<eos> See, I couldn't even tell the police if I wanted to.<eos> P.S. I have to be sure.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Is this your slutty girlfriend?<eos> You told her I was your girlfriend?<eos> No, uh, I didn't.
Hey, Spence, it's me.<eos> I'm just calling to check on you.<eos> Call me back.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna grab some juice boxes for us to take to the park, okay?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Oh, my God. Shh. You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Almost done.
I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I haven't seen him.<eos> Did you see a blond come through here?<eos> Nobody's come through here in the last few hours.<eos> I just saw her.<eos> She was wearing a red coat.<eos> Look, no Toby, no girl in a red coat, and no unicorns, either. Sorry, Emily.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Because you told me earlier.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't want you involved.<eos> At all.<eos> You want me involved.<eos> They all want me involved.<eos> Like today, I gotta go to Billy's Show and Tell.<eos> His future depends on it.<eos> It's two twenty.<eos> Doesn't school get out at three?<eos> Listen Rose, you don't have kids yet.<eos> I do.
His!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> His!<eos> What you said made him so angry?<eos> What have you said?<eos> I said I was going to Stockholm.<eos> Now she sleeps.<eos> - You do not know where she was going?<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.
Obviously, these people don't care.<eos> Why should we?<eos> Okay.<eos> We have their license number.<eos> You got to do that "bad cop" thing one of these days.<eos> Come on, you love it.<eos> Bad cop is always hotter.<eos> That's true.<eos> You know what would really be hot?<eos> I do.
There was nothing I could've done for any of them!<eos> Tell me she's lying.<eos> Tell me this isn't you.<eos> He was going to expose me.<eos> You stood to lose everything.<eos> So you stole drugs from the hospital, you incapacitated him, and you killed him, because he knew.<eos> What did he know?<eos> He walked into a movie halfway through, watched two minutes, and he had an opinion?<eos> About ethnic cleansing?<eos> The whole world does.
You use it, and I monetize it.<eos> No, no, we can't call that kind of attention to the lab.<eos> Jason, you can't deny me the chance to actually get something out of all of the work I've done.<eos> No one can know about Blackout, all right?<eos> Not right now.<eos> We got to focus on getting a biochemical profile of Ian's brain... that's it.<eos> [Scoffs] I have to go.<eos> Go where?<eos> Hey, we got to strategize.<eos> No, we don't.
- I think you're trying to punis...<eos> - Screw you.<eos> If you really think that I sent that, then we have nothing more to talk about.<eos> If it wasn't you, then who?<eos> Oh, speak of the devil.<eos> Kenneth, when are you gonna lay off?<eos> Oh, you make it too easy, Jason.<eos> Let me guess what this is about... my research.<eos> Oh, you've got bigger problems than that, my friend.<eos> I do? Like what?
- Did you mean it?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You can call her whenever you want.<eos> You found him.<eos> Where were you, squirt?<eos> Huh? You had us worried.<eos> I didn't find him.<eos> Some friendly neighbors back there did.<eos> They told Joey they saw him on TV.<eos> They did, huh?
Sure we do.<eos> I read vibes.<eos> Your mom can solve any problem with sex.<eos> Your dad can give anyone the perfect nickname.<eos> What did you call me this morning?<eos> Laurie Povich.<eos> Laurie Povich!<eos> Ellie can start a fight between any two people.<eos> Oh, I bet he doesn't want kids.<eos> Sure he does. Don't you?
By the way, your ass is looking tight.<eos> Calm down.<eos> We're not there yet.<eos> All right.<eos> Name?<eos> I said "name."<eos> Ron Mexico.<eos> I want to hang out with a guy named Ron Mexico.<eos> Hey, you want to come watch me bust up a meth lab?<eos> Hell, yeah, Ron does!
Yeah, me, too.<eos> Ditto.<eos> You gotta be there emotionally.<eos> Here you go, Jules.<eos> You have an amazing gift.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mm.<eos> Look... all I wanted was for you to get into the game.<eos> I want to know your opinion on things.<eos> No, you don't.
You just got here.<eos> Guess I'm taking that personal day after all.<eos> Well, why don't everybody just go home?<eos> Bye, Lace.<eos> (Indistinct conversations) Did you make up with grandma yet?<eos> We don't make up, honey.<eos> We endure.<eos> I know things with you two can get... complicated.<eos> (Sets utensils down) I know you're mad at grandma because she never talks about grandpa, but you don't talk about him either.<eos> (Chuckles) Yes, I do.
Adam, uh, six feet tall, brown hair, lives with a chick who's w-w-way too hot for him?<eos> All right, even your compliments are creepy.<eos> All right, he's with Timmy, and they're with a client for the rest of the afternoon.<eos> Ugh. So coming down here was a complete waste of time.<eos> Well, now, not necessarily.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, you seem tense, and, uh...<eos> I think I have just the thing to relax you.<eos> Yeah, you wish.<eos> No, you do. - Aah! - Aah!
All right, Jeff, could you just pretend to be interested in the dinner instead of just what happens back at the apartment?<eos> I'm not just talking about what happens after dinner,<eos> I'm talking about role-playing the whole night.<eos> Really?<eos> What, uh...<eos> What role did you have in mind?<eos> What's say tonight you are Nicole Kidman?<eos> [Laughs] Well, how oddly specific.<eos> Uh, so you want me to wear this to the restaurant?<eos> Yes, I do, Nicole.
It's in the back.<eos> If we knew someone else who had a phone, we could call them.<eos> And since we are celebrating... ..I had this delivered from Rackham's Department Store.<eos> Will you open it?<eos> No.<eos> Save it for a special occasion.<eos> Right, your first job for the company.<eos> I want you to get that to my sister.<eos> I don't see her?<eos> No-one does.
Of course.<eos> Who doesn't have friends?<eos> I'm not a freak.<eos> Hi.<eos> James Van Der Beek, celebrity mentor you requested.<eos> James Van Der Beek?<eos> I asked for Mario Van Peebles.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> I don't even know who you are. Dang!<eos> Sure you do.
Do you know how much it costs to have a baby in the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just not ready to have to another kid. I mean, I barely just got my shit together.<eos> You know that 400 bucks you said you lost and I said Chloe probably took it?<eos> I know you took it.<eos> And I know you probably spent it on drugs.<eos> I didn't spent it all on drugs.<eos> You should have told me you knew.<eos> I was waiting for you to do that.<eos> And you didn't.
I know, I know, but now Gray Leverson's falling like shit and I'm supposed to be up there selling.<eos> Right now I'm supposed to be making a move.<eos> So, why aren't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Or I'm just shit.<eos> No, you're not shit.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
So, why aren't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Or I'm just shit.<eos> No, you're not shit.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
My beta levels are sky-high.<eos> Rm Pregnant!<eos> That's great news, isn't it?<eos> - Some enthusiasm!<eos> - It's the last thing I expected to hear.<eos> You're telling me!<eos> Isn't it crazy?<eos> - We have space, right?<eos> - We more or less have money...<eos> We do.
What the fuck?<eos> Didn't you have plans?<eos> Yes, it's just a quick hello.<eos> I met your uncle.<eos> Jesus, bet he talked your ear off.<eos> No, he's nice!<eos> He said to tell you he left for a meeting.<eos> Yes, a meeting with a pint at the pub.<eos> The plan about Formentera sound nice, you never told me.<eos> I didn't? Oh...
Is that a question?<eos> No, but I do have one...<eos> Why?<eos> I-I was trying to be nice.<eos> Try again.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I've got this friend who is always getting into trouble, you know, dragging everybody down, and he's got this horrible habit of just disappearing, leaving everyone else to clean up all his messes.<eos> So I-I-I guess I just learned how to do that.<eos> How'd you know it was me?<eos> I didn't.
Family dynamics come into play, insecurity...<eos> This girl's bad.<eos> I mean, you don't write it down, but you know it.<eos> Did the hairs on the back of your neck stand up?<eos> She could be mean. We don't diagnose 'mean.'<eos> Did they stand up?<eos> We don't diagnose 'cold' or 'bitch' either.<eos> And she's all that.<eos> You're not answering the question.<eos> Yeah. They did.
It's complicated, okay?<eos> I'm... I'm just putting feelers out there right now.<eos> Yeah, well, when Mitchell finds out, the only feeling you're gonna be getting is fired.<eos> Well, I'm assuming you're not gonna tell him.<eos> Savannah, you've worked here for ten years, built a reputation, you climbed the ladder till you're, like, five minutes from partner.<eos> - And you're just gonna throw it all away...<eos> - Dominic.<eos> - To go work at some mediocre firm?<eos> - I have to.<eos> No, you don't.
Did you read the information packet?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> And yet, you still took pictures.<eos> Look, I know it says no photos on the inside, but we needed them to sell it, and Maria was totally on board.<eos> Alas, her husband, a very private man, was not.<eos> This was my mistake.<eos> I knew who you were and I had a lapse in judgment.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> You have no idea who I am.<eos> Oh, in fact, I do.
Vodka or whiskey?<eos> You go ahead.<eos> Come on. You can be a good boy downstairs, not up here.<eos> Seriously, I'm good.<eos> Whiskey, I think.<eos> So what's your good news?<eos> I wanna know what we're celebrating.<eos> Why did your... Why did your date ditch you?<eos> - I asked you first.<eos> - I did, downstairs.
You don't have to answer that.<eos> That's true, but I want to understand.<eos> Why take a man's life?<eos> When Mr. Martin woke up, the worst you were guilty of was break and enter.<eos> They would have given you probation.<eos> But I wouldn't be invisible anymore.<eos> I like to be invisible.<eos> Where that kid's going, he's going to wish he was invisible.<eos> That kid needs help.<eos> Most of them do.
Maybe he's an immigration lawyer.<eos> Not immigration. Criminal.<eos> I'm telling you,<eos> I remember this Spreg guy from my time in gangs.<eos> Repped low-level pushers and pimps.<eos> Now he's riding around town in a high-end limo.<eos> He's moving up the food chain from thugs to bosses.<eos> He probably wants to look like a big-shot with a driver.<eos> Let's go pay him a visit. I love talking to lawyers.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Scott kept his nose on the road, but he had his ear on you. What?<eos> No, I've never seen this before.<eos> Benito Diaz.<eos> Arturro del Rio.<eos> Gabriel Luna.<eos> You picked them all up at the cruise terminal, and you brought them to the airport.<eos> Every Tuesday.<eos> So, was it you or Lomez who found the wire? Look, I didn't know anything about the wire.<eos> So Lomez found it.<eos> No, he didn't.
It's incredible how fast some people come up with lies.<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> I'm old for a violinist.<eos> At least for one as good as I am.<eos> I don't care.<eos> All I wanted to do was go to New York.<eos> In a few years.<eos> But it'll be too late.<eos> My feet are already in wet cement.<eos> Plenty of girls do just fine without Juilliard.
You think it's good?<eos> Makes me smile more than the original.<eos> - Do you want to see the new voice-over?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't ruin your evening.<eos> Not mine, but there's people working out there, Peggy.<eos> It's New Year's Eve.<eos> If you knew you had something, you should have let them go.<eos> - They know they can go.<eos> - No, they don't.
Is he no longer with us?<eos> When he was around 40, he developed pancreatic cancer.<eos> By the time they found it, the tumor had metastasized to the liver.<eos> They gave him chemo, but... it was just a waiting game.<eos> The kids both offered to look after him, but he wouldn't hear of it.<eos> In those last months, he seemed more peaceful than I'd ever seen him.<eos> And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No one did.
Want to rethink the non-plan, shellhead?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Just shoot your little arrows and let me handle it.<eos> We have to find the Skull before...<eos> One dead Avenger isn't enough?<eos> There is nothing you can build that I can't manipulate, Stark!<eos> Tell me that was someone being fashionably late.<eos> It was.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you needed me before I accepted your invite.<eos> And of course, you do.
Olivia Leland.<eos> The murder?<eos> That case was solved years ago.<eos> By Detective Sakelik.<eos> You might want to look into the case again.<eos> Look into the Leland case.<eos> You didn't have to kill Annabelle.<eos> She was going to ruin everything.<eos> Annabelle didn't want what we want.<eos> She never did.
We all do.<eos> I feel like I'm doing that.<eos> You aren't.<eos> Uh, if you ask me, you're the one who's making too much of this whole thing.<eos> Too much?<eos> Of my daughter's suicide?<eos> She didn't commit suicide.<eos> She tried to very hard.<eos> Even the doctor said so.<eos> Well, of course he did.
I raised one.<eos> My God, Jessie, you talked about killing yourself once a week.<eos> I talked about it, but I never tried it.<eos> And I'm saying she didn't really mean to, either.<eos> It was a-a cry for attention.<eos> If she really meant to kill herself, she'd be dead.<eos> I hereby call this meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee to order.<eos> Mr. Berenson, in accordance with the practice of the committee, would you stand and be sworn?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Okay, calm down. How can we fix this?<eos> I don't know, okay?<eos> But we have to figure it out, because I will not be able to live with myself if she does not get in.<eos> Ooh, I have a theory that might help.<eos> Ah, what if subconsciously, you are sabotaging Natalie?<eos> How does this help me right now?<eos> Well, now you know. I mean, it's a normal human impulse.<eos> You're talking about her going to college, which means she's leaving you one day, so you're sabotaging her now because you love her, and you wanna keep her with you.<eos> Do you realize the irony of you saying this to me as I'm moving in your house at my age?<eos> Well, I didn't, but I do now.
But I believe the proportions are evident in human genome DNA.<eos> The systems appear in recognizable biological settings, too, like the branching in trees, phyllotaxis, and the fruit sprouts of pineapples.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't I go to school?<eos> Got it.<eos> You ready?<eos> Ready to roll.<eos> Okay, well done.<eos> I know you know how much my son appreciates what you're doing, but I want you to know,<eos> I do, too.
Can 35-year-old, George from Ohio continue the celebrations?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - How are you?<eos> First name?<eos> George. What are you cooking, Bud?<eos> I'm cooking Greek wedding soup.<eos> Wedding soup. Are you married?<eos> - I'm not married yet, no.<eos> - All right, do you have a girlfriend.<eos> Yes, I do.
I have to speak to you.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - It's urgent.<eos> I'll just be a moment.<eos> You told me that Wassily was a Stasi informant.<eos> Yes. He was supposed to recruit scientists from the West.<eos> He had never been to the West.<eos> People have many faces.<eos> Do you know that you're very beautiful?<eos> Of course you do.
Hey, man.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Uh... pff! - Well, hey. - Hmm.<eos> I brought over some of your stuff from the beach house, where you could still stay and let me take care of you.<eos> Thank you, but I feel like I should be here for Liam, you know?<eos> I'm worried about him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He, uh, did it up with this whole nursemaid routine, huh?
- Wanted to check on you.<eos> - She's hot, huh?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You feel responsible for what happened.<eos> A little.<eos> Don't.<eos> It was my call to split up.<eos> So what did they bring in on our vic?<eos> You think I read their report on the way over?<eos> So you didn't?
Agent Parker how many people are a part of Joe Carroll's cult?<eos> Early evidence suggested somewhere under 12, but... in light of Carroll's recent escape, tactical resources, manpower, it could be upwards of a hundred.<eos> Carroll's visitors log in prison contained 47 false identities, and his internet usage, although heavily encrypted, suggested twice that many.<eos> That's a guess at best, Agent.<eos> Are we looking for a cult compound like Waco or Jonestown?<eos> Yes.<eos> We believe there to be some sort of safe haven.<eos> But you don't know where that is.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
May we be of further assistance?<eos> You hungry?<eos> Well, I show a Krispy Kreme a mile on the right-- I think you need it.<eos> Ah, I'm good.<eos> Drive safely, ma'am, 'cause we are always here for you.<eos> This could work out, chica.<eos> This could seriously work out.<eos> Ah, what the hell, man?<eos> You didn't come to a complete stop.<eos> Yeah, I did!
Bring it in.<eos> Have a stretch.<eos> All right, on the ground.<eos> Oh, I'm so wet.<eos> Not in a good way, either.<eos> Mr. B's a hottie, though.<eos> Fuck, I know.<eos> Right? Too bad he wants to get it in with April!<eos> I know.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Have you ever fancied seeing somewhere a bit more exciting?<eos> What, like Glasgow?<eos> No, like China, or Brazil.<eos> I nearly went to India once.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Couple of Lasses I knew from art school bought themselves a camper van.<eos> They were gonna drive there, down through Europe, then Turkey, into Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan.<eos> They wanted me to go with them.<eos> So why didn't you?
Car's just outside.<eos> Dad wants a cup of tea.<eos> I'll make it.<eos> You all right?<eos> Aye, fine.<eos> Do you wanna make it work?<eos> - Eh?<eos> - You and Yvonne.<eos> Do you really wanna make it work?<eos> - Aye, I do, but...
What do you mean, if I'm not ready?<eos> - So you are ready?<eos> - No, not any more.<eos> - But you just said...<eos> - I was ready.<eos> And then you made your position perfectly clear.<eos> But, I thought you were looking for an excuse to end it.<eos> I was looking for a reason to keep going.<eos> - Why didn't you say that?<eos> - I did.
We have case law precedence, federal tort and civil liberties claims.<eos> Just exactly what do you want, Miss Warren?<eos> I'll let my client tell you himself.<eos> Mr. Carroll.<eos> First, Warden Montero and other important people, thank you.<eos> Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share the injustices that have been inflicted upon me.<eos> He said his name was Charlie, and he told me that he was hired to follow me and to report back to Joe.<eos> He had photos and video, and he-- he said he was gonna take me to Joey.<eos> And you believed him.<eos> Yes, I did.
You try being married to him.<eos> He was a hero in public and a monster at home.<eos> When I finally got the courage to divorce him, you know how the media portrayed me?<eos> As just another gold digging trophy wife, looking for her half.<eos> He destroyed my reputation.<eos> He was gonna destroy me.<eos> The only way I could get my life back was to die.<eos> But you needed help.<eos> And Walter needed the money.<eos> At least he did at the time.
I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again, I just... do you have to leave?<eos> Do you want me here because you actually want me here or do you need protection from the redheads?<eos> A little of both.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you what.<eos> If it gets to be too much, You can come and stay... at my place.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you sure it's okay that I'm going to Paris without you?<eos> Just because I'm sick, you shouldn't miss it.<eos> I want you to go.<eos> We all do.
No way you guys are getting a loan anyhow.<eos> Where are you?<eos> My mother's open house.<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Boo, my father finally set the wedding date with Faye Mendelson and my mother is taking it very very well.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> She can't be around people for longer than a minute without crying or screaming.<eos> So here I am wearing the blazer.<eos> Oh, hey, before I forget, did the package arrive?<eos> It did.
How did Sasha like Joffrey?<eos> She's got a couple more weeks.<eos> Oh, I thought she'd be back by now.<eos> Well, have you heard from her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, uh, that's not ours.<eos> Yeah, we didn't order that.<eos> - Yes you did. Yes.
- Is that what you want to hear?<eos> - No.<eos> He would have realized he was out of his mind.<eos> That Vegas made him crazy.<eos> He would have dropped to his knees and asked your forgiveness for bringing the devil to Paradise?<eos> I can't take you like this without a drink.<eos> ( Sighs ) I'm going back on stage.<eos> Michelle, just come home.<eos> You don't want me there.<eos> - Of course I do.

You hear everything just like he was right in front of you.<eos> He is right in front of me.<eos> But this is a movie.<eos> Somehow that makes it seem more real.<eos> If that makes any sense.<eos> It does when you say it.<eos> - We've got a rehearsal, pumpkin.<eos> - Not till 4:00.<eos> You know what the Scouts say, "Be prepared."<eos> So does my gynecologist.
What the he...?<eos> Is that the skinny bitch from the trash cans?<eos> That is me!<eos> Someone recognized me!<eos> All right, gonna go jump in the sack with Gina.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Cleveland, wait.<eos> I just want to go home.<eos> Me, too.<eos> We all do.
- Are you really trying for morning sex?<eos> - I am.<eos> Can I get on top so I don't have to look up your nose?<eos> Yep, yep.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Mmm. I'm sorry. My heart's not in it.<eos> Oh, no one cares.<eos> Except for me. I-I do.
And then his roommates "caught us," and whatever.<eos> Just bad.<eos> Again?<eos> I know I should be the one to tell Travis.<eos> I just can't stand the thought of hurting him.<eos> Oh. Maybe that's the answer.<eos> Maybe we do sexy times once, but I make it so bad that it takes all of the magic out of it. Right?<eos> Only, you guys, I don't know if I can be bad in bed.<eos> Jelly Bean, your head hurts when you try to solve problems, doesn't it?<eos> - It actually does.
What you looking at?<eos> Dunno, lost me zoo book.<eos> Get a job.<eos> I'm sick!<eos> Yeah, in the head.<eos> Mum, I'm going down Sara Banajee's for a couple of days.<eos> Who?<eos> She got into college in Brighton, remember?<eos> They said at primary school that you were University material.<eos> Did they?
Well, her new boyfriend.<eos> She said... Well, she reckons it might for be the best.<eos> In case it causes arguments.<eos> Which it would, so...<eos> This is me home.<eos> Right. Get your glad rags on, lady...<eos> London Town, here we come.<eos> You don't want me coming back with you.<eos> I just said I do.<eos> Yeah, but you don't, so...
- That has nothing to do with it.<eos> So how does Peter fight him?<eos> The way wolves usually do.<eos> Then he can do the same thing?<eos> He can turn when the moon is wrong?<eos> Not for free.<eos> Nothing is for free.<eos> Then what's the price?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
We're falling apart, David.<eos> This is my job, it's my life.<eos> You knew what you were buying into.<eos> You said they deserved it.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Those people didn't deserve what happened to them.<eos> Nobody does.
We'll get out.<eos> You'll be safe.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Anna's mother.<eos> You're Claire?<eos> Yes.<eos> She spoke about me?<eos> Please...<eos> Yes, she did, Claire.
What's... what's going on?<eos> Oh, just wondering...<eos> - About?<eos> - About Ben.<eos> About Ben and why Ben is always so obsessed with you.<eos> You don't think you've done anything that Ben could maybe misinterpret as you being interested in him, have you?<eos> No!<eos> Alice, what is this about?<eos> - Do you have an E-diary?<eos> - Um, what if I do?
George offered to pick up the tab, so...<eos> Perfect.<eos> You can give Grace this little graduation gift that we got for her.<eos> - Really?<eos> You got her something?<eos> - Your dad and I.<eos> Dad doesn't shop.<eos> This is really nice, Mom.<eos> And I know you really don't like Grace all that much.<eos> Well, I do, I do, Jack.
- Why?<eos> - We've got the best desserts in town.<eos> No. I know what this is.<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - Hi, Ethan.<eos> - Kathy, thanks for taking my call.<eos> Pretty polite for a guy who's just trying to have sex with anyone who will have sex with him.<eos> I didn't know Layla was talking about you like that.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
(Dallas gasps) Oh, my gosh.<eos> Look at Yakult.<eos> She's sound asleep.<eos> You calmed her, Yoni.<eos> Well, it wasn't so much the work of Yoni as it was the absence of George.<eos> Every since you banned him from your home and agreed to not let him... wax your walrus, the dog has found peace.<eos> Well, we typically don't refer to it as my walrus.<eos> And I don't recall banning George from my home.<eos> You do or you do not want the dog to make the full recovery?<eos> I do.
Right here, wiki says,<eos> "thousands of unsolved child murders, every super moon."<eos> Even worse than what he just said, it says, "dogs suck each other's magic sticks."<eos> - What the...<eos> - Okay, stop it.<eos> It's not saying those things.<eos> You're making 'em up. It does say it.<eos> It's Wikipedia.<eos> It says very important information.<eos> - No. Does not.
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you.<eos> Your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.<eos> I can be forgiven?<eos> For everything bad I've ever yes.<eos> And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?<eos> That's right.<eos> That's pretty cool.<eos> We've got a new member today!<eos> Eric Cartman, do you love your country?<eos> I do!
He never went back to the first victim's family.<eos> She didn't have any family.<eos> Kelly does.<eos> Casey, her sister.<eos> And if she goes home, she'll be alone.<eos> You might be right, Rick, but you've gotta stay here.<eos> No, you don't know what he sounds like, Hank, I do.<eos> He makes this noise.<eos> Nick's gotta go.<eos> We all do.
I'll have Rolland sit down with you and hand over the files, paper, most of it only need to be scanned and shredded<eos> has Mark been told about Foist yet?<eos> like I said, you're the first to know do you mind if I'm the one who break it to him?<eos> not if you're gonna rub his face no no, of course not<eos> hey, you got a minute?<eos> what for?<eos> just to talk what is there to talk about?<eos> business alright get in here if you're going to linger in the hall like that<eos> you like me in your office, don't you?<eos> yes, I do
I requested the mediation.<eos> You?<eos> Why?<eos> You need to be removed from your positions.<eos> The firm can't be merged with you in control.<eos> Mr. Hayden, this is... we've been nothing but cordial.<eos> This is not about cordial.<eos> I had a firm ready to merge, to pay off your creditors, and you sabotaged it.<eos> - It was a bad deal. They wanted to break us up.<eos> - Yes, they did.
But Gob wasn't acting.<eos> He'd just forgotten that he had met a still-partying Rebel Alley.<eos> It's a little dove.<eos> He's so cute.<eos> And Rebel returned home to an unfortunate surprise.<eos> She felt bad, so quickly put it in a bag, wrote down the species and location from which she'd acquired it and then one further caution.<eos> It was a merry mix-up.<eos> But neither of them knew any of this.<eos> Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about, Michael.<eos> Yes, you do.
I didn't need to kill him.<eos> I checked everything before the show.<eos> Everything.<eos> I don't think people realised just how smart Simon was.<eos> I did.<eos> I heard it in the headphones.<eos> I actually touched his hand.<eos> What do you think of James?<eos> Simon had enemies.<eos> James didn't.
Yes, I am.<eos> Thanks for last night.<eos> I was a jackass.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What are these?<eos> Don't get mad, uh, 'cause I actually think you're the type of girl who might get offended by something like this, but I bought you a car.<eos> - I have a car.<eos> - No, you don't.
That's why I didn't wanna stay in the same hotel room, that's why I didn't wanna play The Newlywed Game, and that's why I didn't wanna go to this damn baby shower!<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> I am not messing around.<eos> We are not now, nor will we ever be, a couple.<eos> So you're not gonna pass that truck?<eos> You're just gonna stay behind it for the next 75 miles?<eos> You really didn't like me defending you?<eos> No, I did.
Caterer?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> It's kind of freaky, right?<eos> I can't believe it's in less than a week.<eos> - Something wrong? - Uh...<eos> I guess I'm just having one of those moments where I'm seeing my life from the outside in.<eos> Maybe Dixon will understand what I'm talking about.<eos> Wait. Why don't I have a number for Dixon?<eos> None of us do.
Mm. That is why I've made up my mind.<eos> You guys kindly took me in during a very difficult time.<eos> I'm making a little money, and it is time for me to stand on my own two feet.<eos> I... am gonna start contributing to the rent.<eos> It's a bit. She's doing a bit. (Laughs)<eos> That's hysterical. (Laughs)<eos> What?<eos> Honey, you don't...<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.

(Laughs)<eos> What?<eos> Honey, you don't...<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.<eos> A lot of it, actually.<eos> No, you don't.
Where are we going?<eos> Where's dad?<eos> ( Sighs ) Thanks.<eos> For what?<eos> ( Chuckles ) I needed that.<eos> We're gonna have to do that again. ( Laughs )<eos> I might have to keep you around.<eos> I don't have to leave.<eos> ( Chuckles ) Yeah, you do.
You know, making a connection is not as tough as you might think.<eos> Have you watched the kids in the hall?<eos> They have this whole unspoken language of communication that helps them to link up.<eos> Sometimes it can be something as small as just, like, a tiny head nod.<eos> They also think it's fine to punch each other in the privates.<eos> Well, that is always a classic.<eos> But the good news is, I think I can teach you some strategies that might help you to score some amigos.<eos> - Are you game for that?<eos> - Do I have a choice?<eos> No, you do not.
The handcuffs are so you won't hurt yourselves.<eos> And when one of you starts bugging out, we'll know who's on tap to be puppy chow.<eos> So...what's our play?<eos> Well, you camp here, figure out who whored their soul.<eos> I'm gonna go scout the grounds -- see if I can't gank Huckleberry Hound before he makes his next move.<eos> Wait, you're not going alone, Dean.<eos> I'm gonna come with you.<eos> Wrong. Uh, they're on lockdown, and you need backup.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
This was before the Cassitys had money, but it was the best she could do.<eos> So I grew up on this farm.<eos> That's how you met Crowley?<eos> They had this big dinner, and after, I saw him kissing Margie.<eos> I ran.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> But Crowley found me.<eos> We talked.<eos> He seemed so nice.<eos> The best con men always do.
- Where is she now?<eos> - Harlem.<eos> Damn it, Joanna, she might see you.<eos> I can't believe I have to remind you that I'm a cop.<eos> We wanted to know who posted the 50 grand and bail.<eos> I see Sofia with a magic closet full of cash,<eos> - I follow her.<eos> - It doesn't make sense.<eos> As far as we know, she didn't know who Ben was.<eos> But maybe she did.
He went to see Haverstock.<eos> Stupid, impulsive...<eos> He has a right to answers.<eos> Not to this.<eos> Get me the boy.<eos> I know about Vivian.<eos> Now, my father may not have the balls to expose you.<eos> I do.<eos> You really don't want to threaten me like that.<eos> Actually, I really do.
We have to change the dressings every two days and keep using this antiseptic.<eos> What's wrong with his legs?<eos> Right, come on, little monsters.<eos> We'll come back up soon.<eos> Should I perhaps tidy round a little?<eos> Would that be useful?<eos> No.<eos> Does my house offend you, Vicar?<eos> Oh, it's Reverend, actually.<eos> No, it does not.
May I say a blessing for Thomas?<eos> I am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the Lord.<eos> He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.<eos> And who so ever liveth, and believeth in me shall never die.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I couldn't save him.<eos> I tried...<eos> I tried so hard.<eos> Of course you did.
It was me.<eos> I'm sorry for being the one who didn't die.<eos> What consolation could I ever possibly be?<eos> Julia...<eos> It's just... I needed you...and you went.<eos> And I needed my dad.<eos> I lost six of my babies.<eos> I lost them too.<eos> I have a broken heart, love.<eos> I do.
I was wondering if you yourself had any concerns?<eos> What, you mean apart from him?<eos> Apart from him and including him.<eos> She won't talk to me about anything.<eos> She's always saying, "Ritchie loves me, Mum.<eos> He protects me.<eos> "He never lets me out of his sight".<eos> I never wanted her to marry him.<eos> When the first was on the way, I was terrified he wouldn't.<eos> But he did.
You must telephone Nonnatus House.<eos> That's Poplar, 459.<eos> We've arranged for you to have the baby in the Maternity Home.<eos> What about Lorraine?<eos> You mustn't leave her alone.<eos> I never leave her alone.<eos> I love him.<eos> But I know him.<eos> And I love her.<eos> Of course you do.
Come on, let's go find him, eh?<eos> Come here!<eos> I'd do anything for her.<eos> I know.<eos> She'd do anything for him.<eos> I can't even tell you the things that people say.<eos> Ignore them, Mrs Gray.<eos> You know your own daughter.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
And you make sure you hold her hand!<eos> 'Nonnatus House...'<eos> I've watched people do this time after time.<eos> Sitting waiting for news, not knowing, hoping.<eos> Never really known what they felt... until now.<eos> She's still in theatre.<eos> There was another haemorrhage.<eos> We haven't got a telephone number for Madeira.<eos> Her family don't even know what's happened.<eos> Yes, they do.
Okay, freeze it.<eos> See?<eos> Unnecessary arm touch.<eos> Now notice how he's not taking his eyes off your mouth.<eos> What does it mean when they look at your mouth?<eos> It means they wanna put things in your mouth.<eos> Like feed you?<eos> Oh, that's dirty.<eos> O.M.G. I didn't even see that.<eos> He did a butt check.
Well, I don't know where we're going.<eos> I want it to be a surprise.<eos> Where are you taking us anyway?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> I promise, you'll all love it.<eos> We're all hanging out with the McCormacks.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - You promised we'd love it.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> - You did.
Oh, I- - I'll go get him.<eos> Anne, do not get in there with him.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Bobby, get the bag! - Wh-- wh-- Whoo-ooh-ooh!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> It's pretty badass that you stopped crying.<eos> I think I may just be out of tears.<eos> Hey, why did you pick me instead of Riggs?<eos> I know people say that redheads are shady and shiftless--<eos> They do?
Anne, do not get in there with him.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Bobby, get the bag! - Wh-- wh-- Whoo-ooh-ooh!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> It's pretty badass that you stopped crying.<eos> I think I may just be out of tears.<eos> Hey, why did you pick me instead of Riggs?<eos> I know people say that redheads are shady and shiftless--<eos> They do?<eos> I do.
Lots of memories.<eos> To the fallen.<eos> To the fallen.<eos> Nervous?<eos> Yeah, a bit nervous.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He says he's looking forward to seeing me.<eos> Did you ask Keith about the riots, when they first started putting us back?<eos> Yeah. He says you're talking bollocks.<eos> Course he did.
What happened?<eos> Why...<eos> Why are you the way you are?<eos> When you died... everything turned to shit.<eos> Life didn't mean anything any more.<eos> So you... you offed yourself?<eos> You shouldn't have done that, Ren.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Had the whole world at your feet!<eos> Did I?
Oh God.<eos> So are you going?<eos> Just go.<eos> Nazif, papa give me a marker.<eos> Bye, baby girl.<eos> Mama, give me a marker.<eos> I don't have one.<eos> But you do, you have many.<eos> I do not.<eos> You do, you do.
You really feel that way?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Look, I'm just busting your balls.<eos> That's what brothers do.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> Of course I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm proud as hell.<eos> I brag about you every chance I get-- ask anybody in the convention industry.<eos> I just figured you knew.<eos> Now I do.
Yes, I am.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> (chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!<eos> Oh, no, you will not tell Tucker I don't want to go.<eos> But you don't.
Maybe I'll text the kraang and ask them to stop mutating stuff.<eos> - Okay, guys, what do you want:<eos> Omelet pizza or pizza omelet?<eos> - What's the difference?<eos> Okay, you caught my bluff.<eos> - Hey, did you guys just get a mass text from April? All:<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Well, does yours also say She's being attacked by an old lady?<eos> - Sure does. - Yep.
Lights up.<eos> Well, Chad was too far away.<eos> And Denny was, too.<eos> Rainy couldn't get to Theresa.<eos> None of us made it in time.<eos> Yeah, but... the flag is gone.<eos> Well, who took it then?<eos> You were all too far away, because you were sent too far away by me.<eos> Detective, did you see me leave this room?<eos> No, I did not.
If I die five years from now, they'll be like,<eos> "well, all right," like it's not even--<eos> It's--<eos> Like, as soon as you're 50, you're a candidate.<eos> You know, there's no candlelight vigils For 50-year-old guys that die,<eos> And you start pushing--<eos> You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s.<eos> You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, And then they're in the news, and it's always some old guy,<eos> "I met napoleon."<eos> No, you didn't, you liar,
Congratulations.<eos> You two are heroes.<eos> These men stole two top secret government formulas, and somehow they wound up here.<eos> You're darned right, they did, and Abner drank them.<eos> Who's Abner?<eos> Abner is Chad's dog.<eos> And by the way, one of those formulas tasted like dog poo.<eos> A talking invisible dog.<eos> Makes perfect sense.<eos> It does?
I had a little business to attend to.<eos> - What kind of business?<eos> - Love business.<eos> I made a hot date with that little Afghan down the street.<eos> Good for you!<eos> Shouldn't you two kids get going?<eos> You don't want to be late for school.<eos> He's right, Chad. Can I walk with you to school?<eos> Uh, yeah, sure, I mean, if you want to.<eos> I do.

Hey, Lisa.<eos> Mother, would you please show This gentleman to the door and tell him that I do not wish to be disturbed again?<eos> Young lady, I think you have shown quite enough attitude today.<eos> Now if you can't be polite to Malik, then I am gonna take away your library privileges.<eos> You know what, mrs. Shay?<eos> Maybe you should back off.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm sick of hearing the way you talk to Lisa.<eos> She doesn't deserve that tone.<eos> Nobody does.
Just so it shouldn't be a total loss.<eos> Cobb, what are you doing?<eos> Just stay in the car, Jake.<eos> Don't get your panties in a twist.<eos> - Get back in the car! - That's all right.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> I'm gonna leave a message on the little car right now.<eos> This is our boss' house! Seriously, stop!<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Don't ever do that.
She wants to move this along, meaning she wants me to confess.<eos> Oh, well, right.<eos> It's good to know she's got your back.<eos> With a bayonet.<eos> This looks kinda bad, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, well, it won't once we find out what really happened.<eos> Now do you remember anything about last night, even something little? Well, I've been racking my brain. I can't think of anything that happened to Skylar, but... most bars have a surveillance camera.<eos> Right.<eos> We checked O'Connor's.<eos> They do.
And where exactly in the club did this fight take place?<eos> When you split his lip, did he go down hard?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Right about here.<eos> Then this... would be Tommy's blood.<eos> Adam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got a knife?<eos> Yeah, I do. Hey.
What do you hear?<eos> The lady of the house.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Please let it be him, please.<eos> It should have been you, asshole.<eos> It's the second door on your left down the hall.<eos> Make sure you stack them vertically.<eos> I'm responsible for those girls.<eos> What if something had happened?<eos> Well, nothing did.
I said what's going on with you?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I'm angry and I'm frustrated.<eos> I'm not sure I'm fit to be a cop anymore.<eos> Oh, come on, you're as fit to be a cop as any cop I know.<eos> What if the next time, because of how this went down, I hesitate and an innocent bystander gets killed?<eos> You won't let that happen.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Helen?<eos> Is this being recorded?<eos> Yes.<eos> My sister...<eos> Julie, she...<eos> She killed herself.<eos> She'd come back to live with us.<eos> Me and...<eos> She'd lost another job and... things hadn't gone right with her for a while.<eos> They never did, really.
He's called Rob Waddington.<eos> He's lovely.<eos> He's just like Frankie.<eos> He's going to be our new sergeant.<eos> You'll love him.<eos> When he smiles, it's like the sun coming out. I want to be his mother.<eos> How nutty is that? OK!<eos> Well, I don't mean that literally, obviously.<eos> He tried it on with me a few times, did Frankie.<eos> He did with everyone.
And had sex.<eos> He couldn't keep his hands off me.<eos> How often would that happen? A lot.<eos> He's my boyfriend.<eos> Who knows Craig's your boyfriend?<eos> No-one. He said people would think it was...<eos> -I forget the word.<eos> -I can think of a few.<eos> Who else knows that Craig told you to hit the residents?<eos> No, he didn't.
They've generally enough demons of their own to bother with.<eos> Someone...<eos> Someone she interviewed when she was younger, from years ago?<eos> Someone she helped get sent down.<eos> They've just got out and they've held a grudge.<eos> They're not criminal masterminds.<eos> Surely to God you know that by now.<eos> If it IS personal, it's more likely someone she's pissed off recently who hasn't had time to get over it.<eos> When does she come face-to-face?<eos> She doesn't.
So what's going on with you?<eos> You were in a bit of a state last night even before the Tequila took over.<eos> Alex broke up with me.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> Sorry but not surprised, right?<eos> It's not like anyone ever expected me to be relationship material.<eos> Well, not with a woman, because... you're not a lesbian.<eos> It shouldn't matter, Harry.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It does.
What?<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> I just met you, and you're some kind of criminal.<eos> Yes, I am a criminal, but one with a heart of gold.<eos> Look, if you help me get out of here, we will figure out what happened to you, and I will bet you that Audrey can fix it.<eos> That's just what she does.<eos> Why should I believe any of this?<eos> Do you want to spend the rest of your life thinking that you're crazy?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
That's exactly what Arla told me when Vince and I had her prisoner.<eos> So you could kill me, Jordan, get your revenge, get to live the rest of your life troubled.<eos> Last touch you ever feel will have been mine.<eos> Or you can let me live.<eos> I will find Audrey.<eos> I'll convince her to kill me.<eos> The troubles will end forever.<eos> And you expect us to believe that?<eos> Hey, crazy town, you know him.<eos> You all do.
Then why did you come back?<eos> Because I got a second chance to make it right.<eos> I won't let more people be hurt because of me.<eos> And Conrad, he wouldn't want you hurting people because of him.<eos> I don't think that I can live without him.<eos> I loved him so much.<eos> Whatever you did must've worked.<eos> I learned from the best.<eos> Marion didn't want to hurt anyone.<eos> Yeah, well, they never do.
But, um, we're here now, so it's all's good, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Uh, hey, um, you got a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you hold that for a second?<eos> Uh, okay, so, um, look, I know you think I was using Megan to get back at you, and... and although torturing you does feel good, um... it's not right.<eos> So I'm gonna stop.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You, know, I just realized that torturing you is just another way of hating you, and I don't want to hate you, Ade.<eos> I don't.
Alex, when I saw you today in the hospital--<eos> You mean, when you ran away.<eos> I have... played this moment over and over in my head for years.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Alex, I wanted to contact you every day.<eos> Okay? Believe me. Every day, but... it was easier to imagine that you had some perfect husband, and three perfect kids somewhere.<eos> I wanted that in my life, once.<eos> We both did.
I-I'm guessing he's with Alex.<eos> I saw you with your little soldier boyfriend.<eos> That was him, right?<eos> I bet he's gonna miss you.<eos> I've been thinking about this for a long time.<eos> Stop!<eos> I don't even know how to thank you.<eos> How did you know I'd be in trouble?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I didn't.
College creates education.<eos> And I thought that you wanted to go to college?<eos> I'll talk to grandpa.<eos> You know your mother would have wanted you to go.<eos> Mom's dead and you didn't go.<eos> Yeah, my point exactly.<eos> Look at me. 1st one to get furloughed from the fire Department.<eos> You know mom always gave you crap about driving with a quarter tank.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah she did.
I did.<eos> The judge has agreed to a sentence of 500 hours of community service and two years of probation.<eos> Provisional on the appointment of someone to act in loco parentis.<eos> In loco what?<eos> It means that the court will appoint an individual to assume responsibility for you.<eos> Me.<eos> I say thanks, but no thanks.<eos> Thea!<eos> You don't actually have a choice.<eos> Oh, actually, I do.
He cheated on her.<eos> Is that the best you can come up with?<eos> Dad wasn't the man he said he was.<eos> On "The Queen's Gambit" right before he died, he admitted to me that he failed us.<eos> You.<eos> Me.<eos> And mom.<eos> That he wasn't the man he said he was and that he just wished... he wished he had more time to right his wrongs.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
No.<eos> Just doing your job.<eos> What on earth were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> By running around with the Russian mob and a murderous drug dealer?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> !<eos> Mom, look, the real reason that you're upset is because I told Thea the truth about dad.<eos> She never needed to know that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Sorry. Uh...<eos> Can you not touch me?<eos> Are you...<eos> You're here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got this thing where I can't let a date end in tears, so...<eos> I was gonna make you breakfast, but... you only have salsa, ice cream, and bread.<eos> Bon app騁it.<eos> I owe you an explanation.<eos> You don't.
Listen, you have no idea how badly I wanted to be there, but we can't... we can't leave Charlotte with some poor, unsuspecting doctor.<eos> She'll eat 'em alive.<eos> I know.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was just really looking forward to celebrating.<eos> Well, listen, you and Henry and I have the rest of our lives to celebrate.<eos> Your job right now is to go to court and bring back our son.<eos> Jake... you just said "our son."<eos> Damn right, I did. Mm.
I don't want to.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, no, it's not you.<eos> I mean, you're lovely.<eos> And I think if I was gonna go out with anybody, it would probably be you, but...<eos> But?<eos> But I'm... I'm trying to be okay with just me right now.<eos> And I don't wanna mess that up or cloud it or...<eos> I understand.<eos> You do?
I said that.<eos> I am so thrilled to meet you because, aside from the fact that you exist,<eos> Sheldon has told me absolutely nothing about you. (Laughs)<eos> Well, I wouldn't take that personally.<eos> Sheldon is just afraid that I'm going to... (Clears throat) leave him.<eos> That I'm going to leave him, and then he'll have to explain how he lost such a prize.<eos> So... the less you know, the better. (Both chuckle)<eos> She doesn't filter either.<eos> No.<eos> No, she-- she doesn't.
It ain't a big town.<eos> There's other places to check.<eos> May not have as many guns as were in here, but--<eos> We need as many guns as were in here.<eos> - Ammo, too.<eos> - Yeah, we do.<eos> But right now, I only got a line on a couple.<eos> There's a few places out on the main street-- bars, a liquor store.<eos> Owners had a gun or two behind the counter that people didn't know about.<eos> I did.
Whew.<eos> You're cold as ice, Officer Friendly.<eos> You're gonna need wire, not rope.<eos> Wire.<eos> Nothing she could chew through.<eos> Oh.<eos> You know something?<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't know why I do the things I do.<eos> Never did.
Why then do you conceal yourself with silk cloths?<eos> Alas, I am not a woman of great beauty.<eos> This I cannot believe.<eos> It is my wicked parents who have hidden my face.<eos> They are hoping that the king confuses my disguise for modesty, for if he sees my face, he will be repulsed.<eos> This cannot be.<eos> May I be allowed to determine this for myself?<eos> You are beautiful!<eos> You mock me.<eos> I do not!
- Please don't cry.<eos> - I'm sorry, sir.<eos> It's time to say goodbye.<eos> I got to go, honey.<eos> Bye.<eos> I love you.<eos> Children:<eos> Bye! We love you!<eos> [ sighs ] I thought you didn't have kids?<eos> Oh, I-I-I don't.
I'd like you to meet Charlie Harris.<eos> Charlie Harris?<eos> In the flesh.<eos> Um, Dr. Reid, would you give us a couple of minutes alone?<eos> Have a good look, sport.<eos> This is how it ends... dying alone.<eos> She doesn't know, does she?<eos> About the, uh, ghosts?<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
So bossy.<eos> [ police radio chatter ] I have a body.<eos> What?<eos> Before you say anything, my O.D. is stable.<eos> I was just with her.<eos> Okay, then what do you want?<eos> Well, since I'm stuck here until my O.D. gets admitted, maybe I can help.<eos> Or I could just sit here and not use my advanced medical training.<eos> Want to pass out triage tags?<eos> I do.
That's impressive. What else can you tell about me?<eos> You make more money than I do.<eos> Graham?<eos> Hi, I'm gonna need you to put this around your neck.<eos> And your wait isn't going to be the shortest.<eos> There's a long line-up for the C.T. scanner.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I thought you might want to know, the guy you brought in... I think he might have a couple of broken ribs.<eos> - Did-did I break his...<eos> - No, no, you didn't.
Wow. Angry and quiet.<eos> That's the best kind...<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> - Okay, let's get her to the ICU.<eos> We had a problem.<eos> I-I solved it.<eos> No, you could have killed her.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> No, you don't, Luke.
I'll write you a note.<eos> "Graham couldn't come to work today."<eos> "He was too busy saving a man's life."<eos> [ baby cries ] Aah. How's he doing?<eos> Your father?<eos> How'd you find out?<eos> He woke up and told us his name.<eos> You must think I'm a bad person.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
13 Going On 30, 17 Again, 18 Again, Vice Versa.<eos> - Judge Reinhold.<eos> Freaky Friday.<eos> Oh, Troy, you are so thoughtful.<eos> I wish I had the capacity for sentimentality like you do.<eos> Me?<eos> I wish I was more like you.<eos> No emotional hang-ups, endless cool adventures.<eos> You have it so easy.<eos> No, you do, Troy.

Don't do it like this. I understand why you had to go high concept, because you're scared, but Britta deserves better.<eos> Troy, it's time.<eos> I wish I had my own body back!<eos> Sorry, routine light switch check.<eos> Oh, I've been meaning to see this.<eos> First, the easiest part, because it's the most obvious.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I proved today that I'm not ready for this.<eos> I wanted it to work.<eos> I did.
But we're very close.<eos> And my manager Glenn is gonna walk me down the aisle.<eos> Not your mother?<eos> Ah. She unfortunately can't make it, it being last minute and all.<eos> I'm sure those rehab facilities are quite strict with patients leaving.<eos> Was she excited when you told her?<eos> I haven't gotten the chance to tell her yet.<eos> Really?<eos> Don't you want her to meet the man that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with?<eos> Of course I do.
♪But it was nothing but a twist of barbwire♪ ♪lt was nothing but a twist of barbwire♪ ♪lt was nothing but a twist of barbwire♪<eos> Thank you!<eos> Where'd that come from?<eos> You were awesome up there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You wanna make it a permanent thing?<eos> Serious? Mm-hmm.<eos> Our crowd loved you.<eos> We know you can write great lyrics, and, hell, you already got a publishing deal, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I saw that.<eos> And that, that's where a .223 round went through her skull.<eos> That's the cause of death.<eos> Thanks, Abby.<eos> Beef up patrols on all major highways?<eos> Put Highway Patrol on 12-hour tours.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right, people, let's take it from the top.<eos> You know what I'm about to say.<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> Danny... how is your son doing?<eos> Fine.<eos> Look, just check in if you hear anything, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> We're all praying for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah.<eos> No, I-I'm in Los Angeles, becoming a surgeon, too.<eos> I-I have things I want to do... and be. And-and-and w... we may only be together five minutes every two months, but hey, when we do, we will savor every second.<eos> Because we both know how valuable those five minutes are.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> More than I can hold in my heart.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> I am completely sure of that.<eos> Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me, even if it is only in... 5-minute increments every two months?<eos> I do.
And it's often difficult to distinguish.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Sir, this drug does not exist in France, I can find a similar one<eos> But you should specify to me the pathology it was prescribed for.<eos> You suffer from depression, don't you?<eos> Yes, he suffers from depression.<eos> I'm feeling...<eos> This piano is mine<eos> You know it?<eos> - No, I don't.
I just want a night in a hotel,<eos> Some room service, and some porn.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> Something delicious, and then room service.<eos> Don't worry,<eos> I'm not just here to get away from my children.<eos> I've got a joke for you.<eos> I've got a joke, don't worry.<eos> I'm sure I do.<eos> I do!
I took it once, and I thought, "oh, my god, this is horrible!"<eos> So I took it about 30 more times,<eos> Just to make sure.<eos> And I didn't do acid the right way.<eos> I mean, you're meant to take acid by a stream, by a river, with unicorns<eos> And the babies and lovely--<eos> Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh<eos> Ahh ahh ahh ahh<eos> I didn't do it like that.<eos> I did acid in glasgow in the 1970s,
We would drink all day--<eos> All day in rainy old glasgow-- And then, at 11:00, when the bars shut,<eos> Somebody would say, "anybody fancy a fuckin' "transcendental experience? I've got acid."<eos> And we'd take acid after drinking all day.<eos> And that is not the way to do it.<eos> I--<eos> It's not.<eos> You know, I once took acid After 12 pints of guinness.<eos> You may well judge me, you fuck.<eos> Never do acid after 12 pints of guinness.

Believe me, you were far worse in your day.<eos> My day is not today.<eos> That day is not today.<eos> Today is the day of the Internet stalker. Today is the day for--<eos> Darling, why don't you just answer your phone?<eos> Oh, and it's Beckett.<eos> Maybe she has a nice murder to distract you from your parental paranoia.<eos> Namaste.<eos> So she video blogs, Castle.<eos> So what? Plenty of people do her age.
I was in a car accident and I fell asleep at the wheel.<eos> I hit a truck.<eos> - Did you report this accident?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sure you know that already.<eos> So you left the scene of an accident?<eos> Charge me.<eos> We have your fingerprints on a gun found at the murder scene.<eos> Do you want to explain that?<eos> No, she doesn't.
What's up?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What have I done?<eos> Stand up.<eos> Stand up, or I'll hit!<eos> I wonder why I don't.<eos> Why that phony tip?<eos> What's your game?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will. And soon!
But work can wait a few more weeks.<eos> Well, you look great.<eos> That's a beautiful suit.<eos> Did you get it in Italy?<eos> No, here in Paris when I got back.<eos> I wanted to look good so you'd forgive me more easily.<eos> My conquests have given me courage.<eos> I've decided to seduce you.<eos> I hope you won't dare resist me.<eos> Oh, but I will.
I'll try this green one.<eos> Not bad, eh?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I've never been excited by a dress.<eos> No dress is beautiful by itself.<eos> This one does justice to your figure.<eos> Anyway, it's not the dress I admire.<eos> You have a beautiful figure.<eos> Listen, Chloé.<eos> No, I won't.
I was finally getting somewhere.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> She didn't take the bodies.<eos> What?<eos> I kept telling you.<eos> But there is a man in the lobby. He knows where they are.<eos> He assured me they are in excellent condition... and he wants to know if you're interested... in getting them back.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - He won't say.<eos> He won't?

Now stop it!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Give it up, Wil.<eos> Can't move heaven and earth.<eos> Well...<eos> Whatcha thinkin' about?<eos> You.<eos> Stringy women like you live a long time.<eos> Sisters have seen all their husbands put under.<eos> More than likely you will, too.
-Dinner's on the table.<eos> -I'm not hungry.<eos> -The food is getting cold.<eos> -I'll eat out later.<eos> -You just told me to make you dinner!<eos> She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.<eos> That's it, break it all, you spoiled Guinea brat.<eos> Break it all!<eos> Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?<eos> Maybe I will.
Ain't that a wonderment.<eos> That damn train's done jumped the track.<eos> CHARLEY:<eos> I brought it just to show you all it's a pleasure to be doing business with you here in Northfield.<eos> I'd like to dedicate this first song to all the folks of Northfield who've done business with us. And to those who will do business with us in the future.<eos> We'll have it working soon, folks.<eos> Come back later.<eos> Just a few minor adjustments.<eos> You said it would work. It will.<eos> It will.
"I can't let them stop me."<eos> "I love them like brothers..."<eos> "And I'll never abandon my brothers."<eos> Don. Alberto.<eos> You found her.<eos> Great.<eos> But you must be tired now.<eos> Give me the girl.<eos> I'll take her back to the village.<eos> Will you?
- What do you say, men?<eos> - To what?<eos> You mentioned two matters.<eos> I think we ought to break off contact with those up top. Start a hunger strike and hold out.<eos> Or go up at once.<eos> All the workers and all honest Poles are now looking to us.<eos> We can't turn our backsides to them.<eos> They're writing about us.<eos> - Shall we give up or not?<eos> - We won't.
Say it again.<eos> Violet?<eos> Violet's a real pretty name.<eos> Put it on.<eos> You're beautiful, Violet.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> You're as beautiful as anybody I ever seen.<eos> If you do real good...<eos> I'll take you to the fair.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'll have to drive all night to make it. When will you be back?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I don't know. We'll have to see how it works out.<eos> I'll, um... I'll phone you.<eos> Did you say good night to the kids?<eos> No. I was just going to.<eos> Good night, daddy.<eos> Good-bye, darling.<eos> Don't forget to ring me when you get there.<eos> I will.
He's crying all over his nose.<eos> He's got a nose like strawberries.<eos> Nogood Boyo gave me three pennies yesterday, but I wouldn't.<eos> Hello, Gwennie. I'll give you six pennies.<eos> He loves me, he loves me not.<eos> He loves me, he loves me not.<eos> Bloody funny fish.<eos> Would you like this nice, wet corset, Mrs Dai Bread Two?<eos> Would you like this?<eos> No. I won't.
Uh, yes, that's right. I'm on a cycling tour of north cornwall...<eos> I will not be defeated!<eos> I will return to my country To fight against this new tyranny!<eos> This is clodagh rogers, the irish-born girl singer.<eos> O, mais oui, c'est clodagh rogers--<eos> I'm just a jack in the box, I know whenever love knocks I'm gonna bounce up and down on my spring<eos> Paul!<eos> C'est clodagh rogers La fameuse chanteuse anglaise.<eos> I will never surrender!<eos> I will never...
Here's our chief guest.<eos> If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast.<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let Your Highness command upon me to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie for ever knit.<eos> - Ride you this afternoon?<eos> - Ay, my good lord.<eos> Is it far you ride?<eos> As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.<eos> - Fail not our feast.<eos> - My lord, I will not.
O Majesty!<eos> Uncle.<eos> Be patient my child.<eos> The doctors maybe trusted with the life of the king.<eos> It is his third attack in a month.<eos> He may well die of this illness.<eos> We would be stupid not to consider it, and your fate upon us if he does.<eos> He will not die.<eos> I will not let you talk of it.<eos> Oh, yes, you will, Mary.
Miss Dimkins, cover Dicks.<eos> The rest of you, we'll comb that area.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sight of God to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony.<eos> Well it's not funny, it's serious!<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife and live together after God's ordinance and, uh...<eos> Will you? I will.<eos> Yeah, I thought you might.<eos> When Dicks flushes them out, I'll cut off the left flank; Miss, you bring up the rear.<eos> Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband and live together after God's ordinance in the holy s—<eos> Will you?

Tomorrow maybe.<eos> Maybe.<eos> FOURTH NIGHT<eos> Still nothing?<eos> He hasn't come to see you?<eos> He can do what he wants, I don't give a damn!<eos> Don't stay there.<eos> Come!<eos> Don't tell me he'll come.<eos> He will not.
Captain, we are speaking to you as an equal.<eos> I am not your equal.<eos> I'm a solider.<eos> I have 30 men fighting for their lives.<eos> I will not stand down.<eos> I made you.<eos> I picked you up and made you.<eos> - Now I hope the British blast you!<eos> - Never doubt it, General.<eos> They will.
If I work overtime every day and save all I can and do some moonlighting I'II need exactly 15.7 months till I've got my share together.<eos> I'II probably need longer.<eos> Forget the whole stupid idea!<eos> Listen, darling!<eos> Whenever I plan something good, you're always against it.<eos> But this time I'm not letting you stop me. Okay?<eos> You hurt me.<eos> -I'II sell the car.<eos> -No!<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
I want you to be.<eos> You know if it depended on me, I'd be far from here right now.<eos> Oh, but we couldn't manage without you.<eos> That's what the police will also think.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're safe with me.<eos> I killed no one.<eos> Again?<eos> It's difficult to forget.<eos> Ah, you will.
- Let me take a look at them legs of yours.<eos> - They're all right.<eos> You go eat that cat.<eos> Don't you speak out.<eos> That's saddled up and raw.<eos> That's my good Indian jacket.<eos> It's about to become a good Indian vest.<eos> - These'll make good leggings for you.<eos> - You spoil my jacket. I won't wear no legging!<eos> - You will.
We don't talk about my mother.<eos> Look, I'll try to explain it to Mr. Palmer, but I doubt he'll listen.<eos> He's a Texas man.<eos> Come on, Winona.<eos> Oh, look at the little lady.<eos> Don't stare, Donna.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Oh, Miss Stuart.<eos> Miss Stuart, now, you won't forget, will you?<eos> No, I won't.
It's his stomach.<eos> - He's blocking the chocolate!<eos> - What happens now?<eos> The pressure will get him out.<eos> It's building up behind the blockage.<eos> I wonder how long it's going to take?<eos> The suspense is terrible.<eos> I hope it'll last.<eos> He'll never get out.<eos> Yes, he will.
- Your man run off with a painted lady?<eos> - I wish he had.<eos> The way you shoot that gun, can you teach me?<eos> - What for, you wanna kill somebody? - Yes.<eos> - Horse shit.<eos> You couldn't go off and leave a man on the cold ground last night.<eos> - I'll learn.<eos> - You'll forget is what you'll do.<eos> Whatever it is that happened to you, you'll forget it.<eos> - The hell I will.
It depends on what you want to do but...<eos> I'd say your schedule is a heavy one.<eos> It'd take maybe 2 or 3 months.<eos> You'll have to learn Parisian geography, east from west...<eos> Wait!<eos> Let me write all this down.<eos> You must study Parisian geography, learn people's habits and customs, the way they eat and have fun... how they work, and go to work...<eos> You must go where they go for a stroll, such as the pretty woods around Paris...<eos> If I write that... people at home will never believe me.<eos> They won't because to them
One day she spoke of the death of her mother.<eos> Listen, Mr. Jacques... she's left for the sun... in a big car driven by Mr. Thoin. Dad and I were inside with mum. Then, Mr. Thoin... said it was not for children.<eos> And that's when mum was left all alone.<eos> Mr. Thoin was very nice.<eos> Her great dream was to be an actress.<eos> Her father said it was a very tough profession. She must eat well and go to bed early.<eos> She left without saying goodbye.<eos> Perhaps it was for the best.<eos> If you ever see her... tell her Mr. Jacques is still there in his corner.<eos> Yes, I will.
I can not believe it!<eos> What a lovely present!<eos> I baptise you "Snowball", like my other.<eos> I have a friend who knows you.<eos> Mr. Loring, you know, Mr. Jacques.<eos> Ah yes, at the flats. We told each other animal stories.<eos> Him and his ants!<eos> And you... you with your pony drinking water from the river.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have one yet.<eos> One day you will.
- What, do I smell or something?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> My sister didn't mean anything.<eos> She's so used to her hospital routine.<eos> Well, I am going to make up my bed.<eos> Good night, ladies.<eos> I didn't mean that the way it sounded.<eos> There's nothing better than a good, hot soak. Really relaxes you.<eos> Why don't you try it?<eos> Well, maybe I will.
I wish I could do something to please her.<eos> She's moody.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> See? Hey, she's enjoying the water.<eos> - You want to know something?<eos> If you lie down here...<eos> no one can see you.<eos> My, that's a fascinating piece of information.<eos> What's that supposed to mean? Why don't you try it and find out?<eos> All right, I Will.
- Happiness?<eos> - Well, well-being.<eos> Of course, Mr. Luzhin is not young, but he's got money.<eos> Enough!<eos> I remember! You've written about it.<eos> But it'll never happen!<eos> I know for whom all this is being done!<eos> But I won't accept this sacrifice!<eos> I won't! I won't!<eos> No, I won't!
That makes no difference.<eos> But you won't be able to hold on.<eos> If you stay alone, you'll go out of your mind like me.<eos> What... what shall I do?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Break off with everything.<eos> Accept the suffering.<eos> You don't understand?<eos> Someday you will.
Stealing!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Search her!<eos> Search her!<eos> Come on, search!<eos> But if you don't find it, you'll answer for it, my dear fellow!<eos> I'll go to our Sovereign, to the Czar himself and throw myself at his feet!<eos> You think they wouldn't let me in?<eos> You're wrong, I will get in!<eos> I will!
He destroys everything!<eos> You're right, an unpleasant person.<eos> What do you want here?<eos> At least shut up when you're not asked!<eos> The tape.<eos> Can't you make yourself useful and make me a coffee?<eos> What tape?<eos> Micky, you don't know what I have got!<eos> I don't remember where I hid it.<eos> You surely will.
- You're the fatheaded beast.<eos> Quit shouting.<eos> Boy' somebody sure trained 'em.<eos> Which way?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I don't know where we've been and I've just been there.<eos> They can't follow us.<eos> We're safe.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I will if you will.
Might even get a rock slide started and get us that way.<eos> What else can they do?<eos> They could surrender' but I wouldn't count on that.<eos> They're goin' for position all right.<eos> Better get ready.<eos> Kid' the next time I say let's go someplace like Bolivia' let's go someplace like Bolivia.<eos> Next time...<eos> Ready?<eos> No, we'll jump.<eos> - Like hell we will.
Beautiful.<eos> Thank you, major.<eos> I still don't think we should defend-<eos> - Destroy the castle.<eos> I warned you about thinking, Beckman.<eos> Yes, major.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> What do you see out there, Beckman?<eos> -No Krauts yet, sir.<eos> -You never will.
-Anything else, sir?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Make it back.<eos> We'll have a reception for the German tanks.<eos> They're brave sons of bitches and we should not allow their heroic actions to go unsung.<eos> -They should all have a cocktail.<eos> -Cocktail?<eos> -Cognac bottles filled with gasoline.<eos> -Who will the damage pay?<eos> -I will the damage pay.
Congratulations! Well done!<eos> It wasn't my fault.<eos> He cut in!<eos> Come on, get out of here.<eos> Or do you want a push?<eos> Right... driving licence, insurance, tax and registration.<eos> - But officer...<eos> - Can't you speak French?<eos> - Listen here...<eos> - No, I won't...
And all kinds of...<eos> - what's the matter?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Steshka will again sing that romance about a willow tree.<eos> Elisaveta Mikhailovna sings that romance much better.<eos> which romance?<eos> That old romance?<eos> Yes, that old romance.<eos> will you sing for us, Elisaveta Mikhailovna?<eos> Yes, I will.
Samurai ...<eos> Shoes, belts and what knives?<eos> Very good.<eos> Louis.<eos> Shoes, belts, and handle.<eos> And the clock?<eos> Shoes, belts, fuses, covers, cable channels, what about the dynamite?<eos> It appears that you have everything.<eos> Except encouragement.<eos> There, you will, Captain.
Six months off for good behaviour?<eos> What do you mean, "oysters aren't in season"?<eos> Anybody can have oysters in season.<eos> I want them out of season.<eos> They don't have any, Miss Simple.<eos> Then tell 'em to go out and dig for some.<eos> - Hello again.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - We thought something happened. - Don't worry.<eos> It will.
- That damn wine...<eos> What did papa say?<eos> - He said he'd kill you!<eos> Come along.<eos> Take your clothes off, climb up and start whisking.<eos> I can climb on the bench, but the clothes?<eos> Take them off, you'll get sober.<eos> I am sober.<eos> I just feel sick.<eos> Well, then you won't.
No, my life's made up of nothing but chance.<eos> I don't get that impression.<eos> That thing looks dangerous in this weather.<eos> I'm used to it, and I only use it in town.<eos> I take the bus home.<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - Saulzet, near Ceyrat.<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> - Next time we meet.<eos> - We never will.
"In connection with the murder last mercredi... "Of the--<eos> "Twenty-nine-year-old girl, lynn mcnab,<eos> "whose mutilated body was found washed up on the beach. "Open brackets. Tee-hee-hee.<eos> Close brackets." Read on, winthrop.<eos> We printed an apology, sir guy.<eos> And in what language was the apology written?<eos> Polish.<eos> It's gotta stop, winthrop.<eos> It will, sir guy. It will.<eos> It will, it will, it will. Immediatement.
Welcome, your Ladyship.<eos> Forgive me for the delayed welcome, but my horse ran off, with me still on it.<eos> Supper must be ready by now, and when the belly's not fed, there's no sense in the head.<eos> I feel that Michael will forget his misfortune in the presence of this delightful company.<eos> Soon, one of them will strike such sparks in him, that he'll light up like dry wood.<eos> Maidens fear Cupid's arrows, like dogs fear meat.<eos> They're very fair maidens, especially little Barbara.<eos> They don't feel the will of God, yet.<eos> Krysia perhaps, but not Basia.<eos> She will, gracious Lady, she will.
Good God, she'll catch a cold after so much exercise!<eos> Krysia, you stay here! Basia!<eos> Basia!<eos> You heard the order?<eos> I won't let your hand go until they come back.<eos> Then, I am a captive.<eos> Whoever took such a captive, would have no reason to envy a Sultan.<eos> You wouldn't sell me to him, would you?<eos> Come back!<eos> No, I won't.
Yes, I'm told she is a very good looking woman.<eos> Damned if I can find anything!<eos> - What's he looking for?<eos> You've been seeing Herr Beiber!<eos> - There's no law against that!<eos> Depends on who's side you're on!<eos> - I'm on Miss Kerrell's side!<eos> Which side is that?<eos> That's what you're here to find out, isn't it?<eos> - Oh, we will!
Hell, it ain't even steerage, but it's better than nothin'.<eos> Well, I figured I wasn't doing anything else real important, so here I am.<eos> You know what I'd do if I was your age? I'd join up all over again--the fleet.<eos> No, I don't think I'd like that.<eos> I'd like to be able to move on if I got bored or something, you know?<eos> Bumming? That's all right for a while.<eos> But a man's gotta belong somewhere. You know, be part of something.<eos> I mean, that's human nature, right?<eos> I guess I never really thought about it much.<eos> Yeah, well, you will.
Finished.<eos> I finished cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting cutting your hair.<eos> It's all done.<eos> You haven't started cutting it.<eos> I have.<eos> I did it very quickly, your honor...<eos> Sir... sir, sir, sir.<eos> Look here, old fellow.<eos> I know when a chap's cut my hair- and when he hasn't, so will you please stop fooling around- and get on with it?<eos> Yes... yes, I will, sir.
I work myself to death and the bank gets half of what I earn!<eos> Someone's calling you!<eos> Again!<eos> Which one?<eos> That one!<eos> Go on!<eos> I heard Yago say...<eos> - If it rains?<eos> - So? - We'll skid!<eos> - It won't!
What'd I do without you?<eos> - Leave me.<eos> You poisoned my heart...<eos> Well, cheers.<eos> No.<eos> I scared you?<eos> - You'll wake up children.<eos> Come on, I was joking.<eos> Here, drink.<eos> We'll together.
It's the ideal setting for a love scene.<eos> I hope we get a downpour.<eos> An interesting house...<eos> - Yes.<eos> It resembles you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Elegant, cozy, libertine, and quite banal.<eos> Whiskey?<eos> - I don't drink.<eos> Then I won't either.
-No? Then who?<eos> Hello?<eos> For heaven's sake.<eos> It's Ocky.<eos> What do you want, Ocky?<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what about you and that little witch?<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Now you know what it feels like.<eos> You will?
And why not?<eos> - I want to get my family.<eos> I want also to cross this river... but not alone.<eos> We all have wives and children too.<eos> We just have to think of them later.<eos> I've made up my mind.<eos> What about the gold?<eos> What do we do?<eos> I'll take my part.<eos> - You will?
Congratulations, laddie...<eos> Be a good president and do a lot of wise things!<eos> A further point, a further point!<eos> - You also received three votes.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> I'd like to talk to you after the physical exercises this afternoon.<eos> So about what?<eos> Well, about what our plan should be. I've got some ideas.<eos> But you should think, too. Will you?<eos> I will.
You want the public to participate, not to submit passively to sensations.<eos> Indeed... you want them to feel really confronted with the animals.<eos> Quite original, to conceive the circus as a novel.<eos> Isn't there a risk of confusing two quite heterogeneous genres?<eos> I know the practical side, the theory's the problem.<eos> I leave that to my assistants.<eos> As a circus it is...<eos> - Circus too! It's inherent in the circus.<eos> I think you should leave the circus as it is and just give people what they want.<eos> - I won't...
We are. I am. I will.<eos> He was surely right that when there is danger it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth that are best able to able to defend it.<eos> I am an old man, Airey and I've only got one arm to fight the war with.<eos> It won't be enough.<eos> Duberly says it's going to be war.<eos> He says the Russians will fight and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.<eos> Duberly says I can go with the army.<eos> I can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which I am. lsn't it exciting?<eos> -William wants to go.<eos> -Soldiers will.
Each abysmal failure makes a point<eos> Every glowing path that goes astray<eos> Shows you how to find a better way<eos> So every time you stumble, never grumble<eos> Next time you'll bumble even less<eos> For up from the ashes<eos> Grow the roses of success<eos> From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success<eos> Yes. I know, but he wants it to float.<eos> It will !
Her uncle turned up.<eos> And you had a row with him.<eos> He asked my opinion.<eos> And you gave it.<eos> - I only told him the truth.<eos> - When will you learn?<eos> - How can people enjoy that? - They don't.<eos> They just like the effect.<eos> - I don't feel any effect.<eos> - You will.
- Here.<eos> - Happy New Year.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> - To your baby.<eos> - To you.<eos> -You fool.<eos> Come, I'll teach you.<eos> It's great for a nice manly belly.<eos> - Hey, hussy, I don't have a belly.<eos> - No, but you will.
Oh my god, I'm awkward. Go away.<eos> -Why didn't you come upstairs?<eos> -There's too much people for me there.<eos> I thought you've come for me.<eos> -Go back, your husband's there.<eos> -He is.<eos> [laugh] -You're drunk, aren't you?<eos> -So what?<eos> -They'll come to look for you.<eos> -They will.
It didn't seem like six flights when I first saw the apartment.<eos> Why... why is that?<eos> You didn't see this apartment.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> The woman wasn't home. You saw the apartment on the third floor.<eos> That's why.<eos> You don't like it. I do like it, dear.<eos> I'm just waiting for my eyes to clear.<eos> I thought you'd say wow!<eos> I will.

What are you doing now?<eos> Just putting a tiny little ventilation hole in this oil tanker.<eos> Up we go.<eos> That Nicholas was so sickening... with all his blasted sweetness and-- ugh!<eos> I know what you mean, Stanley.<eos> Most of the saints throughout history have been a pain in the neck.<eos> Give me a hand with these bottles, would you?<eos> I'm due down in Fleet Street.<eos> You can't stop, can you, eh?<eos> As a matter of fact, I will very soon.
Because you know a pistolero is in love with you?<eos> I envy you.<eos> I only wish he felt that way about me.<eos> I would know what to do.<eos> Go to him, señora.<eos> It cannot be.<eos> What exactly you got there, Mr. Trent?<eos> Just a little something I got stashed away for a rainy day.<eos> Well, it ain't raining yet.<eos> It will.
- Why didn't you speak up?<eos> - Thought you'd never ask.<eos> - Maudie, get him a glass, will you?<eos> - What'll we drink to first?<eos> I guess I should have told you.<eos> Sometimes you...<eos> I was hoping to see you alone before you left.<eos> - It's better this way, Maudie.<eos> - Come back, will you?<eos> - I will when...
Back as soon as I can.<eos> Here.<eos> Use this till the doctor gets here.<eos> How did this mess get started?<eos> A bunch of men on horseback came flying around the bend and...<eos> What was the idea of diving under those horses?<eos> Diving under those horses?<eos> A man can't shoot good when his horse is jumping, and a horse won't step on a man.<eos> - He won't?<eos> - He will?
Not that way.<eos> I'm tired of being taken for a fool.<eos> Come on, move.<eos> - Please, don't.<eos> - On your way.<eos> I lied.<eos> There's somebody out there.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Wait, I'll go. I'll go.<eos> - You sure will.
Miss is dusting bottles and it's quite an object.<eos> I beg you to excuse her.<eos> I was just wondering if she wanted any advice, what with the fire and so on.<eos> - Tell her I'll be too happy to be of service.<eos> - I'll tell her, sir.<eos> I'm sure she'll be grateful.<eos> - Morning, Mr. Boldwood.<eos> - Morning, Fray.<eos> Tell your mistress if she needs any help, not to be too proud to ask.<eos> I will that, sir.
Three of us?<eos> Where did you?<eos> Well, we three saw the book, young and none of us want trouble with the law.<eos> We could get a good reward too.<eos> But, I suggest we go to some place a little less flashy before the owner returns y. ..<eos> Agreed.<eos> Maybe what he says makes sense.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> You'd better keep it.<eos> Well, if you will.
Get this through your heads.<eos> If this were back east, I could make law the way they do.<eos> But the best thing I can do out here is buy it.<eos> You get good value, don't you? It's been working.<eos> It works until the east gets here.<eos> But if I'm not big enough to buck them when they start to corner the ranges and the railroads and the stockyards, you boys are going to have to go back to living on what the county pays you.<eos> But meanwhile...<eos> Meanwhile, if we don't wanna get eaten up, we're going to have to grow bigger and faster than nature intended.<eos> Yeah... and hope their brothers don't continue to be so lucky as they were this morning.<eos> They won't. One way or another.
- I tell you, you're wasting your time.<eos> - Right, clear the gun.<eos> On target.<eos> Fire.<eos> We'll know in a few moments.<eos> You seem to be looking forward to their approval of using it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I want to live.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> We will.
He doesn't want to go home.<eos> Do you want some tea?<eos> He looked at my portfolio.<eos> We haven't got any coal.<eos> Well put him to bed then.<eos> We can't just keep him...<eos> We've got to send him home to his mother.<eos> His brother died...<eos> He'll jump in the river...<eos> And I will, too!
A typical passive indolence of indolent people.<eos> Ah, I can't believe it's all true!<eos> How long can we stand it?<eos> How long, beyond faith and hope, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, beyond patience and love, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, oblivious to fear, beyond childhood and adolescence, can we stand it...<eos> What does your death prove?<eos> The triumph of beauty and justice!<eos> They will learn!<eos> They will!
So you decided to wait, eh, Mr. Wyatt?<eos> I was interested in...<eos> Making a deal with me too?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> At the right time.<eos> Do you have a light?<eos> Of course, I lose one or two along the line this way but it's great for the sport.<eos> And it's only fair, you know to give them a chance to escape my domain.<eos> But will you?
Joanna.<eos> Joanna.<eos> Joanna.<eos> How can a week pass so quickly?<eos> We made the mistake of enjoying ourselves.<eos> Don' go tomorrow just don't.<eos> Let's not talk about it.<eos> Let's not.<eos> All right.<eos> We won't.
- Vodka and tonic.<eos> - Same for me.<eos> Make it two.<eos> Neely, I have some good news.<eos> You're following Tony Polar in the club here.<eos> - Oh, Lyon!<eos> - Neely, how wonderful.<eos> You'll have to build an act fast, because I exaggerated a bit.<eos> - I told Frank you already had one. - I will.<eos> I will.
Please move quickly.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Hurry, hurry.<eos> Have you come to a decision?<eos> Well?<eos> I think we should give him the equations.<eos> I disagree.<eos> So do I.<eos> You can't allow them to get the bomb ahead of us, Robert.<eos> But they won't.
This is very important to me.<eos> It is only a commodity.<eos> No, it's my future.<eos> You belong to me now.<eos> You were told there is no return.<eos> (Six) Not till I know who you are.<eos> I've never liked secrets.<eos> I want to see him!<eos> No one will see me.<eos> I will.
- How to handle their interstellar relations.<eos> We have the right...<eos> To wage war, captain?<eos> To kill millions of innocent people?<eos> To destroy life on a planetary scale?<eos> Is that what you're defending?<eos> Well, no one wants war.<eos> But there are proper channels.<eos> People have a right to handle their own affairs.<eos> Eventually, we will...
Thanks, boys.<eos> Come on now, we haven't got all day.<eos> Take a long time to me.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Aye.<eos> Come on, hurry up.<eos> And bring the light.<eos> Alright?<eos> Look, suppose this don't lead anyplace, and we want to come back?<eos> Oh you won't mate.
What are they waiting for?<eos> Instructions!<eos> Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain?<eos> I'm afraid not, my mind's a complete blank.<eos> Are you prepared to risk it again?<eos> I thought we're supposed to clear out.<eos> Yes well, the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain.<eos> One more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is.<eos> I see, you want me to help you.<eos> Yes, if you will.
- All right, Zhenya.<eos> I am a little embarrassed of that call at night... too much candour...<eos> No, Zhenya.<eos> I am very grateful.<eos> It's a good thing you woke me and said what you said.<eos> I'm listening. Lena!<eos> I'm here.<eos> I said, thank you.<eos> Just don't apologise, or you'll spoil everything.<eos> All right, I won't.
-Take this!<eos> You're a thief?<eos> -Didi!<eos> -You're gonna get some!<eos> -Didi!<eos> You were beating up my friend?<eos> I was.<eos> And I will beat you, too.<eos> -You're not gonna beat me!<eos> -l will!
Your body... I love it...<eos> I love you.<eos> Anna...<eos> Anna.<eos> I love you.<eos> Anna!<eos> Did you eat the horses too?<eos> I will never die!<eos> I shouted to myself.<eos> I will never...
Holy crap --- damn Virgin Mary!<eos> Let your tongue fart dirty words, Chema, so your tongue cools down!<eos> Good morning, son. Well rested?<eos> I did, but you have to be sore. Why did you sleep on the bricks?<eos> Because I like it.<eos> It's healthy.<eos> Are you already starting to trick me, Chema?<eos> Last night when you left you told me to sleep here.<eos> I thought you had another bed.<eos> Today I will.
Their health is excellent, almost too good.<eos> There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret.<eos> Let the girl show you.<eos> We'll accept your judgement.<eos> You're tired, but don't worry.<eos> You'll feel much better soon.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> Here and here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
That's what I'd like, for her to spend the day at school.<eos> Get down, come on.<eos> She's more affectionate with kids than I am.<eos> I should've treated my son better.<eos> I wonder what he's doing now.<eos> Ow, I burned myself!<eos> I can barely see you.<eos> Miss...<eos> Will you take this man, here present, for your lawful husband according to the rite of our Holy Mother, the Catholic Church?<eos> I will.
I wonder what he's doing now.<eos> Ow, I burned myself!<eos> I can barely see you.<eos> Miss...<eos> Will you take this man, here present, for your lawful husband according to the rite of our Holy Mother, the Catholic Church?<eos> I will.<eos> Will you accept her as your partner and wife?<eos> I will.<eos> Will you take him as your partner and husband?<eos> I will.
Laughing at someone else's misery.<eos> I'll jump off because you disgust me. Your horns are as tall as a tower.<eos> You bunch of vultures gorging on the dead!<eos> Your wallets are full of whores!<eos> You sewer rats with yachts! They'll put a tax on your horns soon!<eos> He says he's unemployed.<eos> - If all the unemployed...<eos> We'll applaud!<eos> He's not going to jump.<eos> - He will.
Yes, men...<eos> Can I call you Sandro?<eos> Luigia, his sister-in-law, from Barletta.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> The mother of a blond, little girl... who's not so blond... or little any more.<eos> She's so fond of you.<eos> Thank you, thank you very much.<eos> It was so kind of you to come.<eos> You'll visit us, won't you?<eos> You will, won't you?
What if he wakes up?<eos> No, they're all drunk, fast asleep...<eos> But if he wakes up?<eos> When he arrived, I locked myself in the room.<eos> He said I had slept with you.<eos> He wanted to Kill me.<eos> He was too drunk to burst the door open.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> - what if he wakes up?<eos> - He won't.
Well, by a rich woman, see?<eos> - A rich woman?<eos> - I'd like to do that much for him.<eos> I'd be certain he'd have a good life, then.<eos> Steady on, girl.<eos> You can't be sure there's something there yet.<eos> This morning, I thought I felt him kick.<eos> How can they kick? It won't be the size of my thumbnail.<eos> - I'll tell you next time.<eos> - You won't!
- Yes, but I couldn't do that to you.<eos> - Thank you, Paulo.<eos> - Don't be stupid.<eos> It's a normal thing.<eos> Why are you bringing these gentlemen?<eos> To spare the cost of a funeral wreath.<eos> I'll leave you one while I take care of Mario.<eos> Maybe afterwards you won't need my gentlemen.<eos> - And you know where Mario is?<eos> - Tonight I will.
What time is it?<eos> 6:25.<eos> At 7, you'll be free...<eos> Do you still love Paulo?<eos> Don't talk about that!<eos> I want to tell you once again.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> I know.<eos> But you're not going to die.<eos> I will.
But you must know how to to sacrifice in this life.<eos> - Your old mother maybe! - No, mister.<eos> My dignity.<eos> I'm sickened by those society girls who wait in rows for a guy they don't even know to beckon them.<eos> Marriage is not a whorehouse.<eos> To go up you don't need the mayor,<eos> When I'll say yes, it will mean something.<eos> Because I have the means to say no.<eos> You won't even have room for a wedding-ring.<eos> I will.
X-rays.<eos> There goes your whole cockamamie case.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What about your little mishap when you were with the paratroopers?<eos> What paratroopers?<eos> You and Charlotte on the garage roof in Toledo?<eos> - That compressed vertebra, remember?<eos> - That was like 30 years ago.<eos> With a vertebra, you can't tell an old injury from a new one, so who'll ever know?<eos> I will!
That's some chariot.<eos> Do they make a two-seater?<eos> - You already got a Mustang.<eos> - And here's a little idea I had.<eos> You mount it on the chair, and any time you need something...<eos> Oh! Don't!<eos> Believe me, Mrs Hinkle, instead of him needing this chair,... ..I wish it was me.<eos> If only they can make him walk again someday!<eos> - I'll be all right, Mother.<eos> - Sure he will.
What for?<eos> They go on over the clothes.<eos> There.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You look terrible.<eos> Can we steal that statue soon?<eos> - I hate to complain but really...<eos> - Have patience.<eos> We will.
What was it?<eos> Tell me, Keiko.<eos> I won't get angry.<eos> He... bothers me.<eos> I see.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> He's so persistent.<eos> I was afraid of that... but hearing this makes me very sad.<eos> I'll tell him to stop it.<eos> I will.
It's a ghost garden now.<eos> - What... what did he do?<eos> Just leave?<eos> - He's gone to find a greener pasture.<eos> Mama says it's a laugh, unless they give land to the man with the reddest hair.<eos> You ever hear from him?<eos> No. He's coming back, though.<eos> 'Cause if he loves us, he surely will come back.<eos> Supposing he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Cut that!<eos> Just get off your butt and bring that little dip back in here!<eos> Now be a good puppy, go fetch.<eos> Fetch, good puppy.<eos> One more game.<eos> I don't like what's going to happen.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No.<eos> But I don't like it.<eos> Maybe you will, Martha.
It's all right now.<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> I remembered.<eos> But it's true.<eos> There will be a reception at our house tonight.<eos> Gustavo will sign the bill for the construction of the new Centre of Culture.<eos> It's a project which my mother has sponsored.<eos> - But I will denounce Gustavo.<eos> - But they'll never believe you.<eos> David, they will.
Somehow he's been using the local zoo to receive his stuff.<eos> Do you like animals, Barney?<eos> The question is, do they like me?<eos> Watch out for this one.<eos> Carson's bodyguard, Hidalgo.<eos> Can you handle him?<eos> If I have to.<eos> Can you handle Carson?<eos> If the cavalry arrives on time.<eos> It will.
Take another step, you'll die.<eos> Then we'll both die.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Don't make me.<eos> Don't make me.<eos> I don't wanna go back.<eos> Please.<eos> I wanna live.<eos> You will.
This house is in the target area.<eos> You and the children go up to the mountain.<eos> That's what you came to tell the commander last night? - Yes.<eos> - That's why he hurried back to the base.<eos> Still, it's strange, his sending you to tell me.<eos> Please, Mrs. Neal, believe us. We haven't a minute to waste.<eos> I can prove that we're telling you the truth.<eos> - Where is your maid?<eos> - Well, she didn't come to work this morning.<eos> - She won't.
Now, we've got a very difficult job on our hands and I want everybody to be on their toes all the time.<eos> If the capsule power falls too low I shall take over re-entry from here, and for that I want the entire team behind me.<eos> Now, base reference one commencing... now.<eos> Yes, they must bring them down!<eos> But why, Doctor?<eos> Because they can't last another orbit.<eos> It's imperative that I talk to you, General.<eos> Get away, old man. Can't you see...<eos> You, will you pay attention?<eos> Will you?
Split four ways, you know.<eos> It's still 10 million each.<eos> I've got my eye on an Aberdeen Angus.<eos> I've always wanted to cross one with my Holstein Friesian.<eos> You'll be able to cross an Aberdeen Angus with a cottage loaf.<eos> Aye, and have plenty left over for scrumpy.<eos> More than you'll ever be able to drink.<eos> Fair enough, then.<eos> - And if they don't pay up?<eos> - Oh, they will.
During the war the aeroplanes used to land here<eos> and hide in the forest.<eos> This is the pilot's clubhouse.<eos> Know what that means?<eos> Sure.<eos> After bombing over Burma the Sahibs used to come back here and would revel all right.<eos> Come...<eos> Aviram where are you?<eos> We won't get the bus after this.<eos> I'll back in the summer vacation.
You are...<eos> That'll be enough, thank you. You may go now.<eos> You're a married man now, with responsibilities.<eos> Now... - What if you were to get hit by a truck?<eos> - Not gonna get hit by a truck!<eos> The point is this...<eos> No matter what happens to you, you are going to want to know that Mrs Ford...<eos> I love the way that sounds, believe me, is being cared for.<eos> All I want to know is that Mrs Ford is on an airplane to Las Vegas this afternoon!<eos> Oh, Stanley, caro, caro, no. Oh, please. Will you please?
The time we live in!<eos> Watching demonstrations on TV like soccer.<eos> I guess you drank to that, too?<eos> - We did, but only to our plant.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Valya, don't be angry.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> Why should I be?<eos> Vladimir Vasilyevich, will you have a talk with them today?<eos> - Yes, I will.
" It would only increase his anger."<eos> "I go... should not"<eos> "He'll think I've gone mad."<eos> "A woman who clings to his youth ."<eos> "The ugly vision who approaches its twilight."<eos> " Haunted by the specter of old age."<eos> "Now I get 4 or 5 years and my youth will be gone forever."<eos> "Now I have nothing left.<eos> Not even desires in life."<eos> "I'll never interested by a man."
- Hey!<eos> - All right, come on now, forget it.<eos> - You're wasting time, they didn't see us.<eos> - Bloody pilots.<eos> All them flares do is make a lousy stink.<eos> Might as well quit using them.<eos> There'll be nothing.<eos> Nobody could find us.<eos> That's right, Standish.<eos> Nobody will.
Okay, Professor.<eos> This time it will not be Leslie.<eos> It will be I, Professor Fate!<eos> Fate the Magnificent!<eos> And it is with no little pride that the Webber Motor Car Company unveils its latest and greatest achievement.<eos> Gentlemen, behold the motor car of the future!<eos> Holy Toledo, look at that car!<eos> Yes, it's quite a car.<eos> - I never saw a car like that in my life.<eos> - You never will again either.
I want to hear nothing more about this troublemaker or anyone like him.<eos> And what commandment is first of all?<eos> Hear, O Israel the Lord, our God, is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and with all thy mind and all thy strength.<eos> And the second thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.<eos> There is no greater commandment than these.<eos> Well said.<eos> You've said the truth.<eos> To love one's neighbor as oneself is more than burnt offerings and sacrifices.<eos> I wish others understood your wisdom.<eos> They will. Won't they, master?
Double it up.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> He's dead.<eos> The M.O.'ll have to write out a death certificate, won't he?<eos> - What will he diagnose, carelessness?<eos> - What's that?<eos> Careless of Stevens to drop dead.<eos> It's a bit late for your jokes, Charlie.<eos> - Word got around yet?<eos> - It will, Bert.
Yes?<eos> Is your suitcase very heavy?<eos> No.<eos> Then, I'll put you down at the level crossing.<eos> - You'll have about 50 yards to walk.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Best of luck.<eos> Don't forget to put me in your story.<eos> No, I won't. OK.
This is my true home.<eos> - We're running late, Joey.<eos> Goose them up.<eos> - Right.<eos> Above the love of the flesh, dear brethren, there is a higher love a purer love, a fuller love.<eos> A love which can only be described as true love.<eos> Richard, wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?<eos> I will.<eos> Patricia, will thou have this man for thy wedded husband?<eos> - I will.
I want that man back.<eos> It ain't my job, Major.<eos> I didn't sign on to go chasing after no homesick soldier boys.<eos> It's mine.<eos> All right, Sergeant, you find him.<eos> Beg your pardon, sir... but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley when they catch him?<eos> What?<eos> Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.<eos> But he won't and the Major will.<eos> Oh, no, Mr. Potts... the Major will not.
-Yes, I do.<eos> I think it's putting a permanent solution to a temporary nervousness.<eos> would you tell that to your daughter?<eos> -I might.<eos> -well, don't.<eos> Marriage isn't perfect but it will have to do until we think of something better.<eos> You've got to try once more, val.<eos> Look, instead of paying me a big fee, why don't you go down to Saks... ... andbuyyourselfablacknegligee?<eos> You'II be surprised at the results.<eos> -I will?
- I can make a hangman's knot.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> - Not now, darling.<eos> We'll have to do something about this room.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I like it just as it is.<eos> We bought you some new things.<eos> We put them in the other room.<eos> We'll bring them in.<eos> No, I will.
My father's right.<eos> You could have killed her.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> She did.<eos> The old girl?<eos> Come on. The bottle was under your pillow.<eos> - She put it there.<eos> - Honest?<eos> - Cross my heart and hope to die.<eos> - You probably will.
He broke 'em up, and without no guns, neither.<eos> I seen him do it.<eos> But then you ain't no Billy Wilson!<eos> _ He didn't mean anything.<eos> _ Why don't he use his head?<eos> If he was a patch on Billy's shirt, he'd get those boys out of town before it's too late.<eos> Look out there.<eos> Them's friends of yours until now.<eos> But pretty soon you'll be shooting bullets at 'em.<eos> You will.
Hey,?<eos> You did not know that I live above a Chinese restaurant abandoned?<eos> Come, I'll show you.<eos> Come on, do not be afraid.<eos> I know you're going through a tough time between cabinet and wardrobe.<eos> - What about Nick said Albert...<eos> - Sandy, to be honest, Almost prefer him to leave, the boy is a little older.<eos> You know that when I signed the contract with the television spent all night Calculating the benefits and making a pension plan?<eos> And it it has started to make lists this year.<eos> Lists all subway stops, underpants, what will Next week.
Dneirf refuses to make crooked mirrors.<eos> - He refuses?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> Shake him well!<eos> - Good for him!<eos> - He's a real boy!<eos> Why won't you make crooked mirrors?<eos> Because they're lying!<eos> Shut up!<eos> No, I won't!
Just me ?<eos> That's right.<eos> Why not ?<eos> I don't want to get called a coward !<eos> No one will.<eos> They're only after me, not you !<eos> Where should I wait outside ?<eos> By the cart house in Yanagi.<eos> You promise to come ?<eos> I will.
Old World?<eos> New World?<eos> What would you prefer?<eos> Very funny, very funny.<eos> But I'd prefer you on time.

I'll see.<eos> If Denby looked like that, he'd still be working for me.<eos> I thought the loan was being made to the Cord Chemical Company.<eos> Well, Jonas...<eos> A good banker looks through the company, to the man behind it.<eos> My experience is limited, but it's still backed by adequate collateral.<eos> Here are the production estimates, Mr. Moroni.<eos> Very optimistic.<eos> How well do you know your business, Mr. Cord?<eos> Not as well as I will next month or next year.
We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina.<eos> I carried Lampião on my back.<eos> Ezequiel!<eos> Levino!<eos> Antonio!<eos> All your brothers are dead, Lampião.<eos> Of your race, you alone are still alive.<eos> The souls of your friends are wandering alone.<eos> I broke everything and nothing has appeared.<eos> Nor ever will!
I will flying queens.<eos> Well.<eos> But without a cap.<eos> You can do conjuring tricks, artistic pyramid, pantomimes...<eos> Continued.<eos> Mitrofanova!<eos> ¬ Is he coming?<eos> ¬ Yes<eos> In addition comes the companion Mitrofanov.<eos> ¬ Also will my dad.
- You never know.<eos> - What about these animals?<eos> I brought fresh food too.<eos> Tinned supplies aren't healthy.<eos> You have thought about feeding them?<eos> There's a sack of chickenfeed...<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> There's no room.<eos> You'll have to leave the lot.<eos> You'll...
Here the old narrative breaks off.<eos> well, I didn't see him go out.<eos> He has been writing all day.<eos> I made him hurry.<eos> I'm the publisher.<eos> Oh. I never thought he went out.<eos> well...<eos> I just dropped in to say New Year's greetings to him.<eos> -Why don't you come in and wait?<eos> -I will.
You couldn't convince her?<eos> - Not in two words.<eos> - What two words?<eos> "Hello, Tex." Then she hung up.<eos> - Did you call her back?<eos> - Four times.<eos> "Hello, Tex", hang up, "Hello, Tex".<eos> I couldn't get past "Hello, Tex".<eos> - Now she's going to have to call me.<eos> - She will.
- I'm what?<eos> - Move over here.<eos> I will not.<eos> I'm... trying to get this zipper shut.<eos> I can't do it if you keep pulling the cover.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Roger...<eos> If I have to stop talking, why don't you stop?<eos> All right, I certainly will.
Madame...<eos> I'm sorry to inconvenience you... but don't you think the Countess of Fleet... would like her pendant?<eos> You and I have not even been introduced.<eos> You didn't think I was going to keep it, did you?<eos> The Countess happens to be one of my oldest... and dearest friends.<eos> Thank you.<eos> MADAME HABIB: Charlemagne!<eos> Nikky!<eos> Nikky!<eos> Will someone please...
- Please do.<eos> - If you had simply found that note in the victim's dressing room and knew no more about it than that what would you have made of the affair?<eos> Well, I suppose I'd have thought the man was being blackmailed and had decided to end it all.<eos> Yes, that's what I thought you'd have thought.<eos> It could be the note was left there deliberately so that you would think that.<eos> Miss Marple, it's been a long, hard day already.<eos> - What are you suggesting now?<eos> - I am suggesting that the murderer of Mrs. McGinty and the murderer of George Rowton are one and the same.<eos> As to who murdered George Rowton, I don't yet know.<eos> But I will.
Oh, I simply want to trace her.<eos> You see, I've been outside the profession for a number of years now.<eos> - And so the only way I...<eos> - Well if you're an old friend of hers, I'm afraid you're in for a bit of a shock.<eos> - Poor Rosie was hanged, you know.<eos> - What?<eos> Yes.<eos> Terrible business.<eos> Terrible business.<eos> Will you?
Goodbye, Odile.<eos> - Goodbye, Pierre.<eos> -Another token, please.<eos> - One more?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - l'm going out.<eos> - Will you lunch here?<eos> - No, I won't.
He had a car.<eos> A red car.<eos> Going over a bridge.<eos> Going home.<eos> Happy.<eos> Oh, they're all singing.<eos> He sends his love...<eos> That's my Fred. That's my darling.<eos> Take good care of all at No. 43. I will.<eos> I will, my darling.
Alright, now back. Okay?<eos> Judy, you really surprise me.<eos> - Do I?<eos> You've always been so dependent, and you're taking this like a Trojan.<eos> I never had to do it before. You always took care of everything.<eos> Know something?<eos> If I had known I would have told you right away.<eos> You should have.<eos> Promise you'll never keep anything from me again.<eos> I won't.
- Are you gonna go back there?<eos> - Just do as I say, there's no time.<eos> Go on.<eos> Actually, I could have let them go to the police.<eos> You know they have no reason to suspect me.<eos> It is better to be sure.<eos> Nothing will be wrong?<eos> In a couple of minutes, now, that car should explode and burn.<eos> The police will know it was not an accident.<eos> Not tonight, they won't.
I'm trying to get some sleep.<eos> Oh, come on, Uncle Herman.<eos> Eat something. Please?<eos> Look.<eos> Today is my last day.<eos> I'm gonna make it.<eos> Tomorrow's the reunion.<eos> You'll never last.<eos> You'll eat before the day is up.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.
UNLESS SHE'S A BARITONE.<eos> SOUNDS LIKE... (men arguing)<eos> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, I WANT TO TALK TO HER.<eos> ...DAVID.<eos> I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.<eos> DADDY?<eos> OH, DEAR, I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALL ENDED.<eos> IT IS, MOTHER, I DIDN'T...<eos> ANNE. NOW, ANNE, YOU KEEP AWAY FROM HIM.<eos> I WILL, MOTHER.
I know YOU! And I know her, and I know that's never gonna happen, so who do you think you're kidding?<eos> !<eos> At least I know where she is!<eos> There we are, then.<eos> It's got nothing to do with Trisha, this is all about me!<eos> We were nice, we were happy, then you give me a kiss and run off with him and you make me feel like nothing, Rose!<eos> I can't even go out with a stupid girl from a shop because you pick up the phone and I comes running.<eos> I mean, is that what I am, Rose - standby?<eos> Am I just supposed to sit here for the rest of my life waiting for you?<eos> Because I will!
- Are you sure?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> I know you didn't intend to stay so long.<eos> I think I'd better go.<eos> I shall need time to arrange for the physician.<eos> We'll see you tomorrow?<eos> If I can't come back, I'll send a message.<eos> You'll tell Jules? Yes.<eos> And... be careful, Leon.<eos> I will.
I was wondering if we should fix a time to meet.<eos> -DOCTOR: Uh, say, five days.<eos> -Yes, that's not a bad idea.<eos> Perhaps you better give us another two, just in case of possible delays.<eos> Hope everything won't be as bad as this place.<eos> No, I hope not.<eos> Put these on, please.<eos> Well, good-bye, Doctor.<eos> And take care of yourself.<eos> Oh, of course, I will.
No, not now.<eos> Right now, flora, as of this moment, you've got to readjust your life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look, is this some kind of a trick?<eos> I want to see harmon, i want to see my husband.<eos> Your husband is sleeping.<eos> When he wakes up, he's going to need help.<eos> Help? What kind of help?<eos> I want to see him.<eos> You will.
I saw them!<eos> We're never going to get out of this awful place.<eos> -Never.<eos> Never.<eos> Never.<eos> -Barbara.<eos> -What do you think it could have been?<eos> -Sheer nonsense, child. Imagination.<eos> -We'll die in this place!<eos> -Barbara, no we won't.
-My mother's what?<eos> What you really needed in your first marriage wasn't so much a mate, as a mother figure. Not so much a wife, as a soft, warm bosom for a little boy to rest his tired head on.<eos> -Now, isn't that what Ellen was?<eos> -Well, part of her...<eos> So you see, there's really no need to be ashamed.<eos> It's natural to be afraid of a relationship with a real woman.<eos> -Oh, come on now...<eos> -Just don't lose faith in yourself.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> Because I won't.
That's the worst quality leather on the market.<eos> They're not made to stand up to her kind of weight, are they?<eos> Oh, take the shopping, Barney.<eos> - Doctor come to see Mrs Coulter today?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Don't wonder she's ill, breathing the kind of air you get here.<eos> - They say it's cancer.<eos> - You're a right happy pair.<eos> - Take the shopping, Barney.<eos> - All right, Mum. I will.
Yevgeny Grigoryevich, it's rude to compare me with a dog.<eos> I'd prefer to be rude now.<eos> You still can live a long life and work, but only on one condition.<eos> No risk and no neutrons.<eos> To be irradiated with neutrons, you got to have them.<eos> You don't have them?<eos> Not even a hint of them.<eos> Don't make a fool of me.<eos> - A reaction won't work out.<eos> - It will one day.
Comrades!<eos> This wedding is a momentous event for our House of Scientists and for our entire town which isn't on the map yet.<eos> However, I'd like to drink now not to Mitya personally, and not even to his success.<eos> I'd like to drink to the great component that he's introduced to his installation.<eos> Unfortunately, the time limitation of a toast won't allow me to give you a detailed description of its construction, but nonetheless I'll try to catch its very essence.<eos> Don't try to catch the essence when drinking.<eos> Then I'll let myself dwell on the effect...<eos> Don't dwell on the effect.<eos> All right, then perhaps you say something instead of me?<eos> I will.
I never expected to be president, and I hope to God I never will be, and I mean that.<eos> But the town's boiling with rumors about his health.<eos> If they're true, I should at least be told.<eos> All right.<eos> But this is just my own opinion.<eos> I don't think the surgery last year was successful.<eos> Well, I was once the happy governor of Delaware... counting revenue from corporative setups and having tea with the du Ronts.<eos> - Now...<eos> - It hasn't happened yet.<eos> Maybe it won't.
You know, I'm a little angry with you.<eos> You didn't call me back.<eos> - Well, neither did you.<eos> If you needed me...<eos> Well, I always need you.<eos> I mean, for typing things up.<eos> Well, all the keys are broken.<eos> It only types in capitals.<eos> Well, then how will we write?<eos> Well, we won't.
Homicide Division.<eos> Lt. Kritzman speaking.<eos> I want to report a murder.<eos> Yes?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> It hasn't happened yet.<eos> - It hasn't happened yet?<eos> - No...<eos> But it will.
The pores should be larger.<eos> And he needs a little more hair, thicker.<eos> He needs a 1/8 inch mole behind the lobe of the left ear.<eos> Report back to duplication immediately and have the corrections made.<eos> You can still alter your decision if this is against your circuits.<eos> My circuits are unoffended.<eos> I suppose it takes courage to submit to a thalamic transplant.<eos> As an unadapted R-34, he has no fear circuits.<eos> Consequently, he doesn't need courage.<eos> He will before long.
And I pretended that I was her son, too.<eos> I just felt like being her son.<eos> Strange, isn't it?<eos> I don't think it's strange at all.<eos> I spoke to your parents on the phone. We talked for a long time.<eos> It's all right. They've agreed to let you stay.<eos> I hate my parents.<eos> We can hate and love people at the same time.<eos> - I don't see how.<eos> - You will.
Do you hear me?<eos> Father, I love you.<eos> You who are in the netherworld.<eos> I have offered you my hair.<eos> I have sacrificed it to you.<eos> Look at my fingernails.<eos> I scratch my cheeks.<eos> I was certain I would find you here.<eos> Are you waiting for your brother the courageous Orestes, to come in defense of his father's tomb?<eos> -He will.
I have offered you my hair.<eos> I have sacrificed it to you.<eos> Look at my fingernails.<eos> I scratch my cheeks.<eos> I was certain I would find you here.<eos> Are you waiting for your brother the courageous Orestes, to come in defense of his father's tomb?<eos> -He will.<eos> -When?<eos> He'll come and avenge our bad fortune.<eos> He will.
You criminal.<eos> Yes, I know, I know.<eos> But I did it all for you.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You made a face and hands for me... from the remains of dead women?<eos> My face is probably as disgusting as theirs.<eos> You'll see for yourself.<eos> I'm taking off the bandages. You will be convinced of the beauty of your face.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Just for a while.<eos> Come on.<eos> I won't hurt you.<eos> You still have your protection.<eos> Come.<eos> I guess I was tired.<eos> - I feel much better.<eos> - I knew you would.<eos> - Let's hope this will work.<eos> - It will.
Look, Donna, we, as entertainers... cannot tailor-make everything we do for children.<eos> It's the parents'responsibility to monitor what their kids watch.<eos> That's a cop-out, Ian, and you know it.<eos> You have to take some responsibility.<eos> Donna, I'm not forcing anybody to log on and tune in.<eos> I create shows people like to watch.<eos> I didn't create the demand.<eos> People like to watch violence.<eos> They always have.<eos> Probably always will.
But he doesn't seem upright.<eos> He dresses in weird clothing.<eos> It's in fashion.<eos> He looks pretty cool.<eos> Seeing the way you make eyes at them, I don't want young guys around here.<eos> I won't run off with a young tenant like Father did.<eos> But I think he'll come back soon.<eos> It's already been 3 months.<eos> I don't care if he never comes back.<eos> He will.
Gratitude.<eos> The only gratitude I expect is my paycheck.<eos> Twenty dollars' worth.<eos> - That satisfies you?<eos> - Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.<eos> Is it?<eos> According to my contract, it is.<eos> Come on, let's get moving.<eos> - He don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - He will, in time.
ONCE IN A WHILE, WHEN I GET BLUE, I TELL MYSELF SHE MIGHT'VE.<eos> UP.<eos> OF COURSE, I'D NEVER MENTION THIS TO YOUR MOTHER.<eos> JUST TO GET EVEN, SHE MIGHT NOT IRON MY SHIRTS.<eos> YOU KNOW, DAD, I DON'T THINK I BETTER TELL BETTY JEAN EITHER.<eos> SHE'D DO THE SAME THING. YEAH.<eos> THEY'RE ALL ALIKE.<eos> JUST THE SAME, I'M NOT GONNA BE LIKE YOU.<eos> I'LL NEVER FORGET EMILY'S NAME.<eos> YES, YOU WILL.
Champagne!<eos> Tomato juice for Mr. Jones.<eos> In your novel, the Welsh are all heavy drinkers.<eos> And the Italians very good lovers.<eos> Let's be friends tonight.<eos> My movie ...<eos> Ourfilmis atriumph.<eos> I await your second novel, Tyvian.<eos> If Francesca convinces you to write it.<eos> I will.
Your kind indulgence, Professor.<eos> Can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businessman?<eos> Hot-blooded businessman who plans to tear down Medfield?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Wonderful things.<eos> Wonderful things for all of us.<eos> Visualize, if you will, a whole new Medfield College.<eos> 10 new buildings 10 stories high.<eos> One building devoted entirely to science.<eos> Two, if you will?
Leon.<eos> We'll start a new life.<eos> A wonderful life, Cristina.<eos> We'll be together every minute of the day and night.<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> Cristina... do you love me?<eos> Will you marry me, Cristina?<eos> You say you love me, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
That is not Rodrigo's way.<eos> Let him fight, father.<eos> He has much to fight for.<eos> Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar, take up the gauntlet.<eos> And may God give you strength.<eos> May God give me strength.<eos> Why have you come here at this hour?<eos> We have come to do battle for the city of Calahorra.<eos> Will you fight to the death without quarter?<eos> We will.
Well, if you stay here, you'll... Either you'll have another murder on your hands, or you'll be killed.<eos> You're not thinking about me. You're worried about Stribling.<eos> You love him. You don't want to see him killed.<eos> I'm not thinking of Stribling.<eos> You're a real woman, Belle.<eos> Sorry that cowpoke won't live long enough to know what he's got.<eos> It's not Stribling. It's Melissa.<eos> She told me.<eos> I can't let you take her, Bren.<eos> I won't.
Whatever you do.<eos> I won't. I don't want to.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Balaam, Isakarom, Asmodeus,<eos> Gresil, Aman, Leviathan, speak!<eos> Which of you is it?<eos> It's Dog's Tail, at your service.<eos> Answer me, Dog's Tail,<eos> Wilt thou leave the body of this woman if I order thee?<eos> I will at once,
That lettler wasn't enough to do this to you, Martha.<eos> You've always thought I killed Roote.<eos> No.<eos> No, I...<eos> Please, don't move away.<eos> I won't. If you don't want me to.<eos> I love to hold onto you, Cliff.<eos> I love you.<eos> You always have.<eos> I always will.
Where is it? Don't lose it.<eos> The general's suite<eos> Yes?<eos> Sergeant Twickenham and his bad manners is waiting.<eos> He's been told everything.<eos> Tomorrow you make your<eos> I do?<eos> Launching the Joint Allied Red Cross with General Zlinkov of the Red Army.<eos> Don't forget<eos> No, I won't, sir.
What is it?<eos> Is Xavier unwell?<eos> It's terrible, Mr Beaufort.<eos> You can't imagine how it was last night.<eos> What's wrong with him, exactly?<eos> What do you care what I have?<eos> They're going to operate.<eos> I'll get better.<eos> I'll be there at your funeral.<eos> Yes...of course you will!
He doesn't have light fingers.<eos> I don't think it would matter so much if he had.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> People who are very beautiful make their own laws.<eos> Did you?<eos> In a way, when I was very beautiful.<eos> All the same, you're very wealthy and you must be careful.<eos> Has Paolo ever told you the story of his friend who was cheated out of 10 million lire by a wicked prince?<eos> - No.<eos> - He will.
Chase, how about you? You got a free dance for the señorita?<eos> Well, sir, excuse me, but...<eos> But this is our dance, don't you remember?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> - Will you have some?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Hey, that's a good idea.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> - Will you...?
Well, I'm going to count.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen...<eos> Why did you let that kitten die?<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I got a lot on me mind just now.<eos> Look, would you like to do something else for me?<eos> Will you run me an errand?<eos> Only, if you do, nobody's to know.<eos> - You haven't to tell the others.<eos> Right? - Oh, I won't.
You won, comrade!<eos> They'll find a body<eos> I'll help you<eos> Good luck, comrade<eos> Disguise yourself!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Here!<eos> It's gold<eos> If the Jew talks, we've had it<eos> He won't
Take care you do nothing to dishonor the house of Nanjo.<eos> I will.<eos> Grandmother, take good care of your health.<eos> Yachimaru put the maid Kozasa completely from your mind.<eos> No daughter of a villain like Gensai must ever come as a bride into this house.<eos> Grandmother!<eos> Today my brother takes leave of us!<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> Take care on your journey.<eos> I will.
What type is that?<eos> Vulture, sir.<eos> Jackals.<eos> They prowl around looking for a good company that's having a little difficulty buy it up for practically nothing, and then they start pulling it to pieces.<eos> Close the plant down, spin it off for a tax loss.<eos> They throw a whole community out of work just to make a fast buck.<eos> I'd sure hate to see one of those ruthless characters get his fat destructive hands on Austen Plastics.<eos> Your opinion of Mr. Cash McCall is a matter of complete indifference to all concerned because you've never even met the man.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you will.
No, may God save the king!<eos> Home, son!<eos> There's something big happening here!<eos> In Rome, we respect history.<eos> Are they putting down the Coliseum to build a hotel!<eos> ? You might have been more comfortable, had you bought a wrist watch!<eos> They've fired the old time recorder.<eos> That's better!<eos> We won't punch in!<eos> - We will, we will!
I am really in love.<eos> I'm delighted to hear it.<eos> Goodbye, Dr. Tredman.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> While it is sometimes possible that love can solve many things love is not so simple that you can rely on it as a complete solution.<eos> So if it isn't all that you hoped it would be if it doesn't work out, don't hesitate to come back quickly.<eos> But it will work out.<eos> And I'm gonna make it work.<eos> But if it doesn't...<eos> But it will.
It's no hurry<eos> Give me a taste.<eos> - Are you sure'?<eos> - Yes.<eos> See'?<eos> It's no good.<eos> You must see a dentist.<eos> No, I don't vvant to.<eos> If you leave it, it'll get worse.<eos> - I won't! - No!
Now you've got the idea, Fella.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> Yeah. " Boy, that Fella was lucky.<eos> "He was an ordinary guy.<eos> "He wasn't tall, he wasn't handsome.<eos> "He wasn't even clever.<eos> "And yet... "...he ended up marrying a beautiful princess."<eos> That'll teach those nagging wives, won't it, Father Fairygod... sir?<eos> It sure will, Fella.<eos> It sure will.
What are we to do?<eos> What are we to do to get rid of the necessity of pretending, telling lies, hiding, living in different cities,<eos> not seeing one another for so long?<eos> How are we to free ourselves from our intolerable chains?<eos> How?<eos> How?<eos> Sometimes it seems to me that... In only a few more minutes a solution will be found and a new, beautiful life will begin.<eos> I know, but the most complicated and difficult part is only just beginning.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> We will.
The prosecutor's office can always receive my report.<eos> The state postal system still works.<eos> Am I bothering you?<eos> - No.<eos> Hot isn't it, young man? - Yeah.<eos> Will it take much longer?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But the Marquis must have light by this evening.<eos> - Don't worry, Cavaliere.<eos> He will, he will.
Why not?<eos> I don't think the Reverend and Pauline would approve.<eos> Well, it's partly that, but mainly because I don't have much interest in anything but my job.<eos> What is it that makes a man want to wear a badge?<eos> Bat, I don't know about other men, but with me it's just Dodge City.<eos> This used to be a nice town, a good place to raise a family, but it isn't anymore.<eos> Could be.<eos> To you.<eos> - Well, watch out for Regan.<eos> - I will.
- And it...<eos> It's a shame.<eos> - Please.<eos> It's a shame for young George.<eos> First his mother and then this.<eos> He's...<eos> He's gonna...<eos> Gonna figure it's kind of rude of us, Chip.<eos> No.<eos> No, he won't, Sam.
A frog!<eos> Careful, you'll stain your cuff!<eos> - Oh, it's nothing.<eos> - There are ways of removing such marks.<eos> What does he want from the girl?<eos> I've been turning it over in my mind.<eos> It simply doesn't make sense.<eos> It's rather complicated, isn't it?<eos> A man who's committed dozens of murders... - should find it easy to kidnap her. - He seems to want her to come to him...<eos> - of her own free will.
- You have relatives.<eos> There's no one here to look after you.<eos> There is no place you here. There's no way you can make a living.<eos> Why do you do this?<eos> Because you have to go.<eos> And because I intend to stay.<eos> Why do you do this?<eos> Don't send me away.<eos> You'll be packed in the morning and I'll take you to the stage.<eos> No, you won't.
- When did Fue disappeared?<eos> - Yesterday night.<eos> And you don't know where she is?<eos> Did you searched for her?<eos> Where did you search?<eos> Fue...<eos> Fue...<eos> Granny...<eos> We will find her.<eos> We will, sis and I.
They're mad... always want to talk...<eos> Ah... you're better?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of the street?<eos> I thought you had gone home.<eos> - No, I want to sell.<eos> - To sell?<eos> - Us two are old friends. - Oh, really?<eos> We're friends, too.<eos> He's a good boy.<eos> I'll with Mr. Mayer in one moment, Miss.
But that's all part of our basic strategy.<eos> Look how the enemy doesn't yet dare attack our main island.<eos> Their supply lines grow longer as our units grow more ready and compact.<eos> Our main forces at home are still intact.<eos> Our Pacific losses are like a single hair off the hide of a bull.<eos> Can't you understand that?<eos> - I understand.<eos> - What do you understand?<eos> That I'll probably die here.<eos> And 2nd Lt. Nonaka... so will you.
I'd almost forgotten they existed.<eos> In holland, you can't celebrate Whitmonday without a pierement.<eos> Even this Whitmonday.<eos> Good luck!<eos> -Do you want me to wait?<eos> -please.<eos> Perhaps you better come inside.<eos> We may be some time.<eos> -It's not safe to leave the car.<eos> -As you will.
- Wait a minute.<eos> Take this.<eos> Don't get mad, all right?<eos> Isn't it a beauty?<eos> - It is pretty. - But you owe me 110 bucks.<eos> - What?<eos> - 110 bucks.<eos> Sad, little birdie?<eos> Hasn't he come yet?<eos> But he will.
And...?<eos> I do not know what to say...<eos> He is young.<eos> Sleeping?<eos> Surely.<eos> Good, I leave.<eos> - Good night, captain.<eos> - Good night.<eos> I hope it does not rain tomorrow.<eos> It will not.
This is my problem.<eos> - This is our problem, our problem.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So what do you want?<eos> I just want you to tell her that I'm sorry.<eos> - All right.<eos> He's sorry, he's sorry.<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> - Will you tell her that?<eos> - Yes, I will.
I love you so much! Hearing problems, you see...<eos> - Come down.<eos> - I don't know if I will.<eos> - Maybe, maybe not.<eos> - I'm waiting for you.<eos> Wait, if you want to.<eos> "You're a female..." "You're the Queen of Hearts..."<eos> Are you going down?<eos> I could, since he wouldn't even dare jump me now.<eos> But I won't.
They'll just come...<eos> It might take quite a long while.<eos> It's so late.<eos> You'd have to wait up.<eos> - I'd rather take her myself.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Can you manage?<eos> - I can manage.<eos> You'd better notify the police right away.<eos> I will.
Why do you say that?<eos> My uncle has nothing to do with it.<eos> You told me you wanted to go to college and study, didn't you?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Do so by all means or else you'll be sorry afterwards.<eos> Then you're sorry?<eos> I needn't go to college.<eos> I think I'll take you to Mother.<eos> She'll consent to our plan.<eos> - Even if she won't, I'll...
That's a lie!<eos> Glaucus is not a Christian.<eos> He did not kill my father.<eos> And you, citizens of Rome, becoming accomplices in a crime, much more atrocious than that accused of the Christians!<eos> Helen is in love with Glaucus.<eos> And the Christian faith is her faith!<eos> You can't look to the truth in her!<eos> Priest, the accusation you direct towards Helen is quite serious.<eos> Ask her yourself. Ask her to deny publicly her adored god.<eos> She will not.
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?<eos> WOULD YOUREALLY LIKE TO KNOW?<eos> YES!<eos> I AM IMMORTAL.<eos> I'M INDESTRUCTIBLE.<eos> I HAVE MADE A PACT WITH A MAN NAMED CADWALLADER.<eos> HE HAS GIVEN ME IMMORTALITY IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SOUL.<eos> MORE SIMPLE THAN THAT I COULDN'T PUT IT.<eos> I'LL CALL A DOCTOR.<eos> YOU WILL NOT.
Kokingo... don't you feel she wants to tell you something?<eos> I have a bad feeling myself.<eos> Have no fear.<eos> I'm simply going to teach him the game of Go.<eos> But Lord Shogen is such a difficult person...<eos> Bear my words in mind and hurry back.<eos> I will.<eos> I'll be going now.<eos> Be very careful.<eos> I will.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnside.<eos> I try to do exactly as you say.<eos> Come and get it.<eos> Come along, come along.<eos> You're so wonderful.<eos> Nobody else would've taken me in, an outcast of society.<eos> I'm grateful!<eos> You've given me a new interest, now that I'm losing Patrick.<eos> - I wish I had someone to look after.<eos> - You will, dear, you will.
- Please get it for me.<eos> - Get it yourself.<eos> Qinawi keeps making eyes at me!<eos> So you want me to go instead?<eos> Do me a favor, get the bucket.<eos> I'll wait for you in my "villa".<eos> Hurry up, Tulba.<eos> This is a preliminary meeting.<eos> We'll register your names to see if we have enough people.<eos> We will, with God's help.
Tina, get the... Scotch?<eos> Bourbon?<eos> It doesn't make any difference.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Listen, Mr. Henderson.<eos> Do you ever publish anything on witchcraft?<eos> - Do you know anything about it?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> You will.
Thank you.<eos> This is fun.<eos> We ought to go for walks more often.<eos> - Those days are over.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> - Your days with the Lombards are over.<eos> - Putting me out of business?<eos> I meant socially.<eos> Anne doesn't like them.<eos> - She will in time. - No, she won't.
I'll work something out on that and let you have it.<eos> That's settled then.<eos> In this establishment it's considered bad luck to say good luck, so I'll just say au revoir.<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> Going away again, Mommy?<eos> Yes, darling.<eos> Just for a little while.<eos> But I'll be back soon. And then we'll have a party and you can wear your lovely dress.<eos> Take care of yourself, love.<eos> Of course I will.
- We've a right to know.<eos> By whose authority is this action being taken?<eos> I can't tell you any more than I have already.<eos> - That's nothing.<eos> - There must be some reason.<eos> - Perhaps the commander can tell you.<eos> - Sorry, I'm not allowed to tell you.<eos> But I can assure you it's official.<eos> That's as may be, but we know nothing about this at the station.<eos> You will, constable, you will.
I've never been to the ocean.<eos> What will you eat for dinner tonight?<eos> Filet of sole with mussels, for a change.<eos> And a lamb filet with truffles.<eos> It's always the same.<eos> It can't compare with your grandmother's cassoulet.<eos> Why don't you stay and have some with us?<eos> - I wish I could.<eos> - Why not?<eos> All right, I will.
in the presence of God and these witnesses and by virtue of authority vested in me by the laws of this state.<eos> If any of you know any reason why these two should not be thus joined, speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Will you take her hand, please?<eos> Do you, Thomas Winters, take this woman for your lawful and wedded wife?<eos> That's you, sir.<eos> Who sir, me sir?<eos> Yes sir, you sir.<eos> I do.<eos> Will you love, honour, cherish, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
Of course, they may wreck the prison.<eos> Before the prison warden left, he gave orders to shoot them.<eos> The convicts are under the prison warden's charge to be cared for, not be murdered.<eos> Can't this man reason with them, or is he afraid?<eos> It is unfair to goad him into danger.<eos> I would not order him in there to die, Jen-ai.<eos> In this mood, the convicts would kill anyone who tried to reason with them.<eos> But it is his duty to restore order, not to slaughter people.<eos> Let others go in.<eos> I will not.
Thank you.<eos> GUARD: Sorry, too late!<eos> Let him go by!<eos> His girl's on that train!<eos> I'm sorry, boys, it's too late.<eos> Look, give him a break, will you?<eos> I'll find her.<eos> When I get back to London, I'll find her.<eos> Sure.<eos> I will!
Apollo still hasn't decided.<eos> We're way ahead.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Why do people fight and cheat each other?<eos> Why don't they trust each other and work to improve the world?<eos> The stars give no answer.<eos> And I know not why...<eos> You soon will, kid.
No, it just won't come.<eos> - Barnaby, you call him.<eos> - Waiter!<eos> I never thought that I'd be in such a place in my whole life.<eos> Miss Molloy, is this what they call a café?<eos> Oh, yes, Minnie.<eos> This is what they call a café.<eos> Sit down, Minnie.<eos> Cornelius, Mrs. Levi gave us to understand that every waiter in New York knew you well.<eos> - They will.
- Little rat.<eos> Come on, quick, before he fetches someone.<eos> Look there.<eos> Which way to the boats?<eos> Any way you like, friend.<eos> Any way you like. All roads lead to Rome.<eos> This way, Pat.<eos> - No! No!<eos> - Come along, madam.<eos> No! I won't! I won't!
Don't be angry with me, but I'm not going.<eos> The trade-unionist government abdicated.<eos> A bourgeois government will take over the power.<eos> The communists will be arrested.<eos> Listen, Ficsor, you're just talking.<eos> What's with the maid?<eos> She'll come, madam.<eos> This won't do, Ficsor. How long will you feed me with empty promises?<eos> - Will she come or not?<eos> - She will, my dear madam.
I don't think so.<eos> The hat. How about the hat?<eos> - You want it?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Then we'll leave it.<eos> I have no use for it.<eos> You never can tell.<eos> Why not take it on the plane and give it to the stewardess?<eos> I don't know the stewardess.<eos> You will.
- Some guy.<eos> More serious than that!<eos> You'd say princess Margaret!<eos> Good day.<eos> I've thought a lot before coming and bothering you.<eos> You're so different from the others.<eos> Did I do wrong?<eos> I haven't died yet for you to bring me flowers...<eos> I only wanted to know if the Ministry had answered you... about that thing.<eos> It will.
Somebody's gonna pay for killing him.<eos> You wanna kill somebody?<eos> Why don't you kill me? - Kill you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You said you wanted to get one man alive out of your platoon.<eos> Well you got your wish, only double.<eos> 'Cause you and me.<eos> Ain't that something? Forget it!<eos> We'll never see the morning.<eos> Yes we will.
What sort of casualties do you anticipate, sir?<eos> Hmm, say, five percent killed by our own barrage.<eos> That's a very generous allowance.<eos> Ten percent more in getting through no-man's-land... and 20% more getting through the wire.<eos> That leaves 65% with the worst part of the job over.<eos> Let's say another 25% in actually taking the Anthill.<eos> We're still left with a force more than adequate to hold it.<eos> General, you're saying that more than half of my men will be killed.<eos> Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel... but we will have the Anthill.<eos> - But will we, sir?
What a disgrace, disgrace!<eos> -Disgrace!<eos> -Nellie.<eos> Don't talk that way.<eos> Nobody's ever gonna know but the three of us.<eos> People find out.<eos> They always find out.<eos> Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.<eos> Understand?<eos> -No, I won't.
I'll give you 200.<eos> When my husband says he isn't interested, Mr. Denning, he isn't interested.<eos> You couldn't buy him for a thousand a week, so stop wasting your time.<eos> Will you let me handle this?<eos> There's a lot of good guides in this country.<eos> You won't have any trouble finding one at that price.<eos> Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.<eos> Think it over, Mr. Cameron.<eos> - If you should change your mind, just-<eos> - I won't.
Man, that's a crazy color.<eos> This is what I've been lookin' for all my life.<eos> I'd sure like to know where your claim is, mister.<eos> - This even feels good!<eos> - I'll take care of it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Don't mind at all. Don't mind to help.<eos> - Just take it easy, pop.<eos> I'd like to have this job by the week.<eos> Maybe you will.
Don`t you realize you have responsibilities to other people? That you have a position to fulfill, that you`re not alone in this world?<eos> You defend yourself like a fort!<eos> No matter how I defend myself, you have to understand that I am not in a position... to be hauling my fiancée away to a shack somewhere... like a alley cat or something like that.<eos> You`ll do everything that`s expected of you?<eos> l`m certainly going to try, l`ll tell you that.<eos> I don`t expect you to marry me just because it`s expected of you.<eos> Listen, sometimes I look at you, and I don`t understand you.<eos> I don`t know what`s going on in your brain.<eos> Sometimes, I don`t know who you are... or what you`re all about.<eos> Maybe you don`t. Maybe you never will.
Gerda!<eos> Gerda!<eos> Kay!<eos> The Snow Queen!<eos> Let's run, quickly!<eos> It's too late.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> Kay doesn't belong to you anymore.<eos> I won't let you have him.<eos> I will not.
Hi, Jake.<eos> Hello, Jake.<eos> You're coming to the dancing, aren't you?<eos> - Dancing?<eos> - Yes, you must come.<eos> We're all going.<eos> It's at the Rue Sainte Geneviève.<eos> Yes. Sure.<eos> Of course he's coming. - And bring your friend.<eos> - Yes, I will.
She said, "I've given up such a lot.<eos> I've had such a happy life with the British aristocracy."<eos> Pretty funny, don't you think?<eos> Brett.<eos> Dear, dear Brett.<eos> Jake, just out of curiosity, are you drunk?<eos> No.<eos> I see. Well, I am.<eos> Why don't you try to get some sleep, Mike?<eos> I will, old boy. A little later?
Don't worry...you won't die<eos> Pull yourself together<eos> I don't want to die<eos> You shouldn't worry like that<eos> What is it, Akiko?<eos> I want to start all over again<eos> I want to lead a new life...a better life<eos> Akiko!<eos> I want to live!<eos> Of course you will.
- Why? Oh, you.<eos> Always asking why when you know perfectly well.<eos> You got some kinda monster inside that house you don't want me to see?<eos> I bet one of your sisters have got two heads.<eos> - Go on home.<eos> - Home?<eos> what do you mean home?<eos> I only meant I've gotta go in now.<eos> I'll see you when you get off next.<eos> Well, maybe you will or maybe you won't.
- Just walk slowly.<eos> But Santina!<eos> What does this girl want?<eos> Always crying, you look like the Petrolio Madonna!<eos> I want to be Saint Agatha!<eos> If you go with this sallow face, they won't even look at you.<eos> Ah, that's it!<eos> Now it's better!<eos> Mom!<eos> No, Mom, I won't!
Well, this evening.<eos> My performance.<eos> All my preparations.<eos> Oh, Lily, we sent the letter to that agency in Chicago.<eos> That's all we could do.<eos> If your mother doesn't come, don't be too disappointed, will you?<eos> Well, what else could I be?<eos> If she were here tonight, my performance would be like Mr Halley's comet streaking across the autumn sky.<eos> If she wouldn't come back for this, I suppose she'll never come back.<eos> Maybe she will, maybe she won't.
I can't do miracles.<eos> I could've kept Carletto, but he'd have starved to death too.<eos> - What about my money?<eos> - I'll send it to you when I get work.<eos> - Can I trust you?<eos> - I'll sign an I.O.U.<eos> - What good is that?<eos> - I'll pay you back.<eos> - You'd better, you see how I live?<eos> - I will.
But I happen to like the Kid, Swanson.<eos> I've known him a long time.<eos> There's nothing bad about him. As attorney for the railroad, I can say, frankly, that we want to be fair with Doolin.<eos> I've hesitated to obtain a warrant against him.<eos> I'd rather leave it up to you, Marshal, to bring him here, just for a talk.<eos> About what, Mr. Thompson?<eos> Just some questions about the Daltons, that's all.<eos> All right.<eos> But you've got to promise me he gets a square deal.<eos> He will.
Then I'll let you know what he has to say later.<eos> Well, that'll be fine.<eos> But, uh... how will you get in touch with me?<eos> Well...<eos> you'll call me.<eos> I'll give you my phone number.<eos> Just a minute, I'll get a pencil and write it down.<eos> But, I might forget to call you.<eos> You know how it is with me.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
- Can he kiss like I can?<eos> - Better.<eos> He's perfect.<eos> - He's in love with me.<eos> - So he's there and I'm here.<eos> - He'll be here tomorrow.<eos> - What are you trying to pull?<eos> You dames are always playing one of us against the other.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> Turk, I won't!
He's a nice boy.<eos> They're going to be married.<eos> Probably has to marry her.<eos> Just 'cause she's pretty and he got amorous one day.<eos> - Like I had to marry you. - Don't, Daddy.<eos> You and Marie are a couple of sluts.<eos> - Daddy, please don't talk like that.<eos> - What are you good for?<eos> - You can't even cook my breakfast.<eos> - I will, Doc, I will.
Don't shoot!<eos> They were holding me in there!<eos> All right, we go now, out the back window.<eos> Wait.<eos> We gotta scatter their horses, or we won't have a chance.<eos> You won't have a chance of doing that, either.<eos> Come on, get ready.<eos> We'll be gone in a minute.<eos> - I don't want this to end here.<eos> - But it will.
We lose a king, or you lose your child.<eos> Your will is ours, Isaac.<eos> My will is God's.<eos> Free the king.<eos> Richard would not accept his throne at such a price.<eos> My daughter does not die to save Richard's throne, Sir Ivanhoe.<eos> She dies to save her people.<eos> Then I pledge my word to put all else aside until she's free again.<eos> But the ransom. Who will take it to Austria?<eos> - You will, sire.

What did you do then?<eos> I tried to get back to dancing, then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.<eos> Did you ever see this young composer again?<eos> Yes, five months later. After I came out of the hospital.<eos> I saw him from the gallery of the Albert Hall.<eos> His symphony was played there.<eos> It was a great success.<eos> Of course you're in love with him.<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> You will.
Go and catch him!<eos> Run after him! Get a policeman! Get two policemen!<eos> When are you gonna stop tagging after me?<eos> - When I want to.<eos> - Why don't you go play with girls?<eos> - Why can't I play with you?<eos> - Cos I don't want you to, that's why.<eos> - Barnaby Fulton, I don't like you.<eos> - Then go away.<eos> I will not, so there.
Yes, that describes him exactly. Oh!<eos> Oh, I thought you meantJim, my husband.<eos> Maybe I did.<eos> He must be a good man if you marry him.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> It's the only fob I've ever seen that's as beautiful as his watch.<eos> It's not just an ordinary watch.<eos> It was his father's and his grandfather's... and it will be handed on down to-<eos> That is, if we have a son.<eos> And you will.
- I'm not Hucko.<eos> - No, that you ain't.<eos> - So?<eos> - So I mean...<eos> - There's one thing only about us.<eos> - What?<eos> Coming together, that's what I call a plenty long shot.<eos> - Nothing wrong with a long shot.<eos> - Lf you come out on top.<eos> We will, Mike.
How's Jean-Marc?<eos> - Well.<eos> Did you tell him his father was on a trip?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> I must go.<eos> I left the car with Jeanne so she could do her shopping.<eos> The party, like every year, is a great deal of trouble.<eos> - Try to make it a success.<eos> - I will.
Did he raise the bet again?<eos> - No, he simply wished that all of our children might be boys.<eos> Lights, music, people who laugh.<eos> Chinatown and the Barbary Coast, oh this is a mad city, this San Francisco of yours.<eos> Thas only because is young, ill grow up someday.<eos> I hope not, I've seen cities that were old.<eos> I was sent to London for my education, I been to Rome, Vienna, my own St. Petersburg.<eos> Cities where each night we wonder if tomorrow's sun will bring us trouble perhaps even death.<eos> Please, God, ill never happen to here.<eos> It won't.
Dad.<eos> Bruno!<eos> You've returned, finally!<eos> You're all I have left.<eos> Why weren't you here?<eos> Perhaps they wouldn't have killed your brother if you'd been here to defend him.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You also suffered, perhaps more than we did.<eos> I will never forgive.<eos> Neither will I, never!
- Oh, I'll take two weeks off sometime and try it.<eos> Mr. Goddard, I'll show you the back way through the alley.<eos> You're learning fast sister. We both are, Mr. Goddard.<eos> Please take care of yourself.<eos> I think the government expects a lot from young men.<eos> It's my job, I have to take the risk.<eos> Well the should get some of the politicians to do it.<eos> When I'm in trouble sister, I'll quote you.<eos> You be careful.<eos> I will.
And how will you know he knows?<eos> He'll tell you maybe?<eos> No, Hans.<eos> By getting him to do right without hope of reward, to avoid wrong without fear of punishment.<eos> Something my father never had a chance to learn.<eos> Don't you see, Hans?<eos> If it works, Dean will have to admit that environment is all-important.<eos> That heredity counts for very little.<eos> Uh, yes, but what if the Dean finds out that you are carrying on this experiment, right in front of his back?<eos> But he won't.
He couldn't learn very much from a man who quits the first time anything goes wrong.<eos> I agree with Momma 100 percent.<eos> Peter Boyd, you are a big quitter.<eos> Oh, Hans, that's not fair.<eos> Who wants to be fair?<eos> Who cares whether you win or lose Miss Tillinghast?<eos> In the interest of science, you should carry on with the experiment.<eos> And I bet with you anything, if it is successful, Miss Tillinghast will beg you to return the--the thing, the engagement ring.<eos> Well, if she does I'm going to tell her that she has Jane to thank for it, believe me.<eos> Oh, you will?
We're gettin' close to Buffalo Wells.<eos> The cattle smell it.<eos> Well, let 'em drink.<eos> We'll bed down here.<eos> Hey, Gabe.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Trouble's brewin'.<eos> Know who's on his way to Texas?<eos> I don't know and I don't care.<eos> You will.
- Who'd you put in charge?<eos> - Flannigan.<eos> When I saw you this morning... I thought for a minute you were crazy enough to go along.<eos> Well, I suppose sick or not, Cassidy would have gone.<eos> Cassidy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was going to go, but I analyzed it... and I decided I'd be more of a liability to the mission than an asset.<eos> Why don't you go below and lie down?<eos> It won't make much difference to the mission now.<eos> It will to me.
I didn't recall you.<eos> I told you that when you needed me, I would come to you.<eos> You defied me. Begone!<eos> Acte, what will they do to me?<eos> They will kill you.<eos> But they won't get in.<eos> You've lived like a monster.<eos> Now die like an emperor, by your own hand.<eos> I didn't wish to be a monster.<eos> The gods willed it.
Same as I hardly know you now that you're quite a woman.<eos> Ma-ma must have looked just as you look now, just before she died.<eos> Perhaps that is what has changed his mind towards you.<eos> He spoke to me so gently one night when I was going to bed, that I wasn't afraid to ask him, just once more, that you might come home.<eos> And he said, "Yes, you should," and sent me in the carriage to bring you, and you're never to come back here anymore, and you're never to be lonely again.<eos> - Never to be lonely again.<eos> Never, as long as I live!<eos> Then, you must live forever, Fan.<eos> Nobody else ever cared for me.<eos> Nobody else ever will.
- Attagirl.<eos> - Yes, massah.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Yes, massah.<eos> Come on, Julie.<eos> Come on, come on, you kept us waiting for you.<eos> - Mr. Green, can we do our number now? - Yeah?<eos> - A little later.<eos> - We hope you like it.<eos> - I will. Yeah?
I want to deceive him... just enough to make him want me.<eos> Darling... do you want him?<eos> I want to rest.<eos> I want to breathe quietly again.<eos> Yes, I want Mitch.<eos> Very badly.<eos> Just think, if it happens... I can go away from here and not be anyone's problem.<eos> Blanche, it will happen.<eos> It will?<eos> It will, honey, it will.
It's gonna be so sweet when we can get them colored lights going... with nobody's sister behind the curtains to hear us.<eos> Steve and Eunice.<eos> Come on back in.<eos> Blanche?<eos> Blanche.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Oh, come on, hon.<eos> Oh, what pretty, pretty candles.<eos> Don't burn them, Stella.<eos> - I certainly will.
Do you know parts of "Ermengarde"?<eos> It goes.. How does it go now?<eos> One, two! Fantastic!<eos> Now Maestro Belloni gave his parrot as a gift to his niece, Ermelinda, who I remember well, who gave it as a gift to the zoo in 1942.<eos> Now we want to recover the parrot.<eos> It's ours, it belongs to us, it belongs to the museum.<eos> They must give it to us!<eos> - Watch that finger!<eos> We must get that parrot!<eos> - You will!
Anything else?<eos> I like you! You never change.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - A model.<eos> What would you like?<eos> A kiss, if you don't mind.<eos> Two martinis then.<eos> Right, let's hear his name.<eos> - Will Enrico Fontana do?<eos> - The hell it will!
Makes your hair so much easier to manage in all this heat.<eos> I can't afford it right now, maybe next month. Yeah, here it is.<eos> No, we didn't take it. Well, we can do it this year.<eos> You work it out any way you think best.<eos> - Have a nice trip, Frank.<eos> - Sure Kitty, see you when I get back.<eos> Bon voyage!<eos> Why don't you come down anyway, Paula?<eos> We'll, uh, work out a deal on that permanent.<eos> Thanks, maybe I will.
What happened, Charles?<eos> What went wrong?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> There couldn't have been anything wrong withe the design aeronautically.<eos> No, it was the motor.<eos> Why after 4 years of development and tests?<eos> It seems impossible but I can think of only one thing... -What?<eos> Somebody tampered. - Sabotage?<eos> That's for intelligence to find out while we build another. I'm afraid you won't, Charles.<eos> - Of course we will!
Hurry! They can't be too far away.<eos> Come with me.<eos> On the ground!<eos> There they are!<eos> Open fire! - Don't let them escape!<eos> - Fire! Fire!<eos> We've been betrayed! Vamoose!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Shall we advance, Excellency?<eos> - Yes, we will.
Good night.<eos> Hmm, next time I come out with you<eos> I'm going to bring along an extra set of nerves.<eos> Whoisyour father?<eos> Police Commissioner or something?<eos> No.<eos> Please don't worry about it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I said, "Don't worry about it."<eos> All right, I won't.
Well, why don't you?<eos> We can finish the script by Thursday.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> You're getting married.<eos> That's what you wanted.<eos> I don't want it now.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Don't you love Artie?<eos> - Of course I love him.<eos> I always will.
I understand congratulations are in order, Miss Lordel.<eos> Oh, well, thank you, but I haven't got the part yet.<eos> She's trying out for a part in the Follies.<eos> - Well, I really meant about you and Harry.<eos> - Oh, Harry.<eos> I thought you weren't gonna tell anybody yet.<eos> They're my best friends, I've got to tell them.<eos> Oh, that music.<eos> Oh, I've simply got to dance.<eos> - Will you?
I think they are going to send her out of the country.<eos> Joe.<eos> Joe, they want to send me away.<eos> They are not going to send you anywhere.<eos> Don't let yourself in for a lot of trouble, Mack.<eos> It's our job to take her, and you know we're going to do it.<eos> Don't stick your chin out.<eos> There's nothing you can do about it.<eos> Come on.<eos> I won't ..
Ouch!<eos> Yeah, like a rock.<eos> Hey, T.B., do they give mickeys in reform school, like these, I mean?<eos> Slop they get, slop!<eos> Unless they get some dough to smear the jailies with.<eos> Tommy will get two years.<eos> Three maybe, I bet.<eos> Yeah, never mind.<eos> You learn a barrel of good things in reform school.<eos> Tommy will, too.
Have you seen her? Heidi!<eos> She's gone!<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Her aunt has taken her to Frankfurt.<eos> She's stolen her!<eos> Where are they?<eos> Stolen?<eos> There.<eos> - I don't think I'll go any farther.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
My husband.<eos> That's an idea, An inspiration!<eos> - What?<eos> - Marry.<eos> - Tonight!<eos> - Marriage is serious.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not those who hesitate.<eos> A girl I should think in their future planning.<eos> If we, we will not ever!
I thought you didn't like Ward.<eos> I don't.<eos> Then you shouldn't worry so much.<eos> MARIE: Oh, it's just nervousness.<eos> You should always speak the truth, Maria.<eos> I am, Mother.<eos> If you speak the truth maybe it is just as good Nicky told Ward not to come back anymore.<eos> Nicky had no business doing that.<eos> He can't... Oh. He will come back someday.<eos> No, he won't.
Yeah.<eos> You ask me, take it or leave it.<eos> I think I'll take it.<eos> Bill, Turkey.<eos> Bet another 1 50 grand on McGraw to win.<eos> No, I'm not crazy.<eos> Donati's backing it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He better win.<eos> He will.
You'll be all right.<eos> Oh, no, he wasn't that bad a shot.<eos> Nicky, you've got to get well.<eos> For Nina.<eos> For all of us.<eos> I was wrong, Marie, about the Kid.<eos> I guess I been wrong about a lot of things.<eos> You two go on being happy, being in love.<eos> - Be careful how you tell Mama about this.<eos> - I will.
- Really, Arthur, I'm in no mood...<eos> - Don't misunderstand me.<eos> I love you, Fay.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Please...<eos> You didn't accept Kelton, did you?<eos> What makes you think he asked me?<eos> Did you refuse him?<eos> No.<eos> You will.
Never you mind.<eos> You send those pigs back to Murphy's farm.<eos> If you see a stork, throw something at it.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Oh, the express.<eos> - A train?<eos> !<eos> When?<eos> - 10 minutes but it won't stop.<eos> - It will!
No, it was swell.<eos> I want to apologize for everything I said to you.<eos> Oh, I was afraid for Joe, but he says you've been grand to him.<eos> Well, he's earned it lately.<eos> He's been taking a different attitude on things.<eos> I know it.<eos> He never wanted to be square with people before.<eos> He's got a lot of stuff in him, May.<eos> Don't you worry about him.<eos> Well, I won't from now on.
We're up to schedule.<eos> The Highway Commission's gonna look you over in about an hour or so.<eos> Keep this gang hopping.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get going.<eos> What're you doing here, Sailor?<eos> Somebody paying off for you, too?<eos> Easy, Red.<eos> I don't get you, Lieutenant.<eos> You will.
My condolences.<eos> I always wished this:<eos> after the road was finished, I'd wear kimono and take your bus.<eos> But before we can walk on the road we built, we must go to the mountains to build another road.<eos> I'll take you to the station in my bus.<eos> I'll walk... together with my friends.<eos> You will?<eos> Then, goodbye.<eos> Don't forget flowers and water.<eos> I won't. Goodbye.
Oh, Mr. Barr, won't you sit down?<eos> Yes, of course you will, I know you will.<eos> Yes, thanks.<eos> Oh, no, no, come right over here.<eos> Would you?<eos> Yes, please do come over here.<eos> All right.<eos> And I know you'll have some tea, won't you?<eos> Won't you?<eos> Yes, of course, you will.
I know we both try to be loyal to Geoffrey by hiding our real feelings but now he's coming back and we can't go on pretending.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> Oh, Perry, I've tried so hard not to, but I do love you.<eos> -I knew it.<eos> -But I'm still engaged to him.<eos> We must tell him when he gets here.<eos> I must tell him, it's my responsibility.<eos> When he knows how we feel, he won't stand in our way.<eos> -Suppose he doesn't understand?<eos> -He will.
In his ceremonial hat.<eos> Now that I've delivered my message, I'll Leave you so you can start your discussion all over again.<eos> I'll run you home. - I'll take the bus.<eos> - No, Let me run you home.<eos> Didn't I say I was taking the bus?<eos> Father.<eos> Will you be happy if I marry Fanny? No.<eos> I'll be furious.<eos> Césariot will never have our name.<eos> No, he won't.
Johnny, do you like me?<eos> Kinda sorry for you.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Here goes.<eos> Johnny, let's get married.<eos> Upside down like this?<eos> Johnny, I meant it.<eos> ─ What?<eos> It's a grand idea.<eos> Johnny, will you?
hello? Yes, it is.<eos> Ayako!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I'd Iike to talk to you about something, but not on the phone.<eos> You know the Suminoe Suites?<eos> could you meet me there?<eos> Is that where you are?<eos> really? I'II be there right away.<eos> You will?
Those fellas just shot Bill Hickok!<eos> Arrest those men!<eos> Come on, you.<eos> Get up.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Bill?<eos> There's your prisoner, General Merritt.<eos> We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done, Cody.<eos> We'll remember.<eos> All of us will. All of us.
- If you'd what?<eos> - Had affairs.<eos> Love affairs before you.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> - Hundreds.<eos> You liar.<eos> I rather wish I had sometimes.<eos> Perhaps then I should have learned some tricks to hold you with when you begin to get tired of me.<eos> I shall never do that, tricks or no tricks.<eos> Oh, yes, you will one day.
- Yes.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> The Castilian isn't going to sail tomorrow.<eos> - What?<eos> - Not sailing?<eos> No use sending a boat out without enough cargo in her... to keep her down in the water.<eos> My, my.<eos> No Jordan boat has missed a trip in 60 years.<eos> I know that.<eos> Will the Santa Clara sail next week?
Of all the cities in the United States, he would pick Philadelphia.<eos> All right now, listen to me.<eos> We open at the Arch Street Theater tomorrow night.<eos> So this is Philadelphia!<eos> Why don't you stop that? !<eos> Peggy.<eos> - Getting a kick out of it?<eos> - Of course, you?<eos> I don't know. Do you suppose anybody'll even know I'm in the show?<eos> I will.
What do you want him to do, get away anyhow?<eos> Of course not.<eos> - But you said you'd fine him if he didn't.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Oh, where's the justice in that?<eos> What have I got to do with justice?<eos> A pilot has got to want to be on time.<eos> Regardless of the weather.<eos> Oh, that isn't going to chase the fog away.<eos> The fog in men, it will.
No! - Take her away.<eos> Looks like a young war around here.<eos> Lost two men to that killer before.<eos> We're not taking any chances.<eos> - I'm gonna ask you to do something.<eos> - Shoot, what is it?<eos> If you see Danny before this is over, give him a chance to speak first.<eos> - That hoodlum, why? - For your own sake.<eos> - I don't get you.<eos> - You will.
I could get real sore.<eos> If I didn't have a lot of self-control.<eos> So have I, but I'm beginning to lose it.<eos> You know, you remind me of a glittering palace of ice.<eos> I ain't ice.<eos> I didn't say you were.<eos> But your diamonds are all going to the storehouse.<eos> You said I had a soul.<eos> I looked for it, but I didn't find it.<eos> - You will.
Since I am the guilty party, I could be your tour guide.<eos> - Do you know Orvieto?<eos> - Well enough.<eos> - Can we really put ourselves in your care?<eos> - You wouldn't want to force him!<eos> It's my pleasure: it's not easy to find such beautiful company.<eos> - Sorry, lady, but you can't travel without a ticket.<eos> - She can't.<eos> - Then he will pay for the tickt.<eos> - I will.
You poor little thing.<eos> -Goodbye, Ned.<eos> -Goodbye, darling.<eos> It's only for six months.<eos> -Come back strong and well.<eos> -Of course I will.<eos> -Say goodbye to Daddy, darling.<eos> -Goodbye, Daddy.<eos> -Take good care of Mummy, Johnny.<eos> -l will, Daddy.
No more fighting.<eos> I didn't want to fight him.<eos> He was bigger than me.<eos> But what shall I do, when he calls me a Frenchman?<eos> Then you give him a good...<eos> No, no, don't do it, don't do it, Fritz.<eos> Hold yourself in, and save it up for a real Frenchman.<eos> You understand?<eos> No, father<eos> You will, my son, you will.
I don't want...<eos> It hurts!<eos> The pain!<eos> Help!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Hurry up, boys!<eos> Come on, boys!<eos> It's so dark!<eos> Hey, medics!<eos> No, I won't!
I've just been to the wedding of an old friend, Ulysse Pijeautard.<eos> Hence the dress.<eos> And the gloves.<eos> Very elegant.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> As I was all dressed up, it seemed a suitable moment to renew a request, the outcome of which will influence my entire future.<eos> I wish to marry your daughter.<eos> You know that already.<eos> Will you give her to me?<eos> Of course we will.
Thank you.<eos> No thanks.<eos> Oh, Carter. Just pack an overnight bag.<eos> I think you'd better come up to the ranch yourself, when you've finished.<eos> Alright.<eos> Those four unsuspecting chisellers, including my host. Are going to be desperate when they hear the bad news.<eos> I may need you.<eos> You may at that.<eos> Whether they like it or not.<eos> ─ They won't.
Marcus!<eos> I intended to see you sooner.<eos> Oh, Marcus.<eos> I couldn't understand why you didn't.<eos> I was called to the palace.<eos> And then this banquet's been raging since noon.<eos> Marcus, I told you last night... my life means more now than...<eos> Suddenly everything changed.<eos> I wanted to live.<eos> You will, Mercia.
I'm so happy.<eos> I prayed all the time to see you just once more before...<eos> Once more...?<eos> What are you talking about, once more?<eos> Fay, honey, how did this happen?<eos> You are going to be all right.<eos> I'll be all right now you are here.<eos> But you won't leave me, won't you?<eos> - Don't leave me, Tom.<eos> - I won't, honey.
Oh, no, he wasn't.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Mr Poindexter and his daughter arrived in Oxford ten minutes after Mrs Downes was due, right?<eos> - Uh-huh. - They caught the train at Reading.<eos> If Mrs Downes had missed her train, she could have caught this one here, connected with theirs, got into Oxford barely ten minutes after she was due.<eos> So what?<eos> Lewis...<eos> Lewis, if you were meeting your wife, and she wasn't on the train, what's the first thing you'd do?<eos> - Look at a timetable.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
We have been on a country picnic, sir.<eos> Hosted by your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She authorized taking out all those carriages and inviting all those girls?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And as she has nothing better to think about than herself, I thought that it was high time someone tried to help her.<eos> Then you really are as insane as all the rumors I've heard about you.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> -You wouldn't want to know.<eos> Yes, I would.
Follow me.<eos> Captain, what have you told the passengers?<eos> As little as possible.<eos> How long you planning on keeping the passengers in the dark about all this?<eos> We're trying to steer around a typhoon, which prohibits any thought of using lifeboats.<eos> And there's a bomb on board.<eos> What do you suggest I do, Mr MacGyver, create panic?<eos> Well, if it was me, I'd be awfully curious, especially with Charlie and me coming onboard a couple hours after that first bomb went off.<eos> Well, tell me, Mr MacGyver, would you want to know that a very good possibility exists that you could die a violent death sometime during the next three hours?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I would.
- Mamma mia, it's terrible!<eos> - Bad!<eos> - I have to pay in advance every month.<eos> - Otherwise, leave me alone with those big ass.<eos> - Among other things, you know ...<eos> - It seems that no ... -... but there are still things to do.<eos> - Put everything in order ...<eos> - He says if I do the Sauna this is anything.<eos> -.. ordered one immediately.<eos> - Perhaps you would happy with that.
Sure.<eos> There 's no hurry.<eos> I said in 6' months...<eos> The rest is coming.<eos> He still inspires you?<eos> Not only that<eos> - You're gonna hear something fantastic...<eos> I'd like to have Berangere, a bit.<eos> I'm organized now, so if she wants....<eos> Sure she would.
I didn't do any of it.<eos> I'm not gonna shoot anybody.<eos> I'm not a killer.<eos> This morning this guy tried to kill me.<eos> He's been following me ever since.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Sure.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I wouldn't either.
You mean with the notes, like in a war?<eos> I got a class.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> So go.<eos> Up yours!<eos> Pretty ugly birds.<eos> You know, if he really can train them to carry notes, I'd buy one.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Sure.<eos> A lot of kids would.
Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> I've got a lot on my mind.<eos> I can't remember everything.<eos> Sure.<eos> Busy girl.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Unless you don't want another kid.<eos> - Of course she wanted the kid.<eos> - Sure I do.<eos> What penniless, unmarried mother of four wouldn't?
Though I must admit, I'm not entirely convinced that she likes me.<eos> Now, don't jump to conclusions, Adric.<eos> Sometimes we... humanoids try to disguise our true feelings.<eos> Well, don't just stand there, Adric.<eos> Help me.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> It's only just sunk in properly, what happened to me on Deva Loka.<eos> What?<eos> The Doctor said nothing eventful had occurred.<eos> He would.
Or you're not as obvious as you might be.<eos> Though I find that very hard to believe.<eos> [Michael] Bonnie, did he actually give me a compliment?<eos> Listen, do any of the drivers know exactly what the mission is yet?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Why should they be briefed before it's absolutely necessary?<eos> That's true.<eos> But if there is a bad guy... he would have to know, wouldn't he?<eos> What a brilliant thought.<eos> Yes, of course he would.
His clientele were the sons and daughters of the privileged.<eos> I decided it might be a good time to have my teeth checked.<eos> Mr Drebin, Dr Zubatsky will see you now.<eos> That's the second door on your left, Mr Drebin.<eos> You're next, Carl.<eos> As soon as this impression is complete, we'll know a lot more, Mr Drebin.<eos> Are those x-rays ready, Miss Frenzell?<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> Would you like to take a look?<eos> Yes, I would.
I got zero in history because of you!<eos> - Right!<eos> The teacher called on me.<eos> Not only I didn't know the answer... I didn't even hear the question!<eos> I was somewhere else... with you!<eos> I was thinking of you.<eos> What do you think of that?<eos> I think you're fooling yourself.<eos> I think you're a little girl who's had a big shock... and it's normal to feel strange.<eos> Anyone would in your place.
- It's all settled.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> She never wants to see me again. She.<eos> Women. Go figure them.<eos> I once knew a guy, he had two heart attacks.<eos> So they put in one of them gadgets, uh, pacemaker.<eos> So his wife divorced him, because she said it was interfering with the TV reception.<eos> Are you leaving? Yeah.<eos> I didn't want this to go to waste. Are you sure you won't join me?<eos> I'd better not.
No, no, I've read the transcript.<eos> Your evidence, as I would expect of you, was detailed, correct, and scrupulously fair.<eos> Nevertheless, I can't stop you setting that ball rolling, but have you thought of the implications, Doyle?<eos> What implications?<eos> You're not only saying that you could have been wrong, but that your colleagues were wrong, too.<eos> Good solid coppers like your partner, Syd Parker.<eos> I still want to make that statement, sir.<eos> Very well.<eos> Do you want me to draft it out?<eos> If you would, sir, yes.
First put on the underwear, which you'll find in the leg of the suit.<eos> Unzip the suit, unsnap the rear panels, hook up the boots, and attach the life support system.<eos> Then snap up the mask, buckle the gloves, zip up the suit, snap up the rear panels. Presto, change-o.<eos> - Any questions?<eos> - Is somebody gonna help us?<eos> How we gonna know we got it on right?<eos> Simply look for these tell-tale signs:<eos> Profuse bleeding of the gums, hair falling out, and intermittent blindness.<eos> - Wouldn't stop my father's gas.<eos> - Nothing would.
-Leprechauns shouldn't smoke. -BOY:<eos> I'm not a leprechaun.<eos> -Hey, have you got any sisters? -BOY:<eos> Yeah.<eos> -How many?<eos> -Three.<eos> That's one each.<eos> It's not.<eos> They wouldn't go out with yous.<eos> Course they would.
I've nothing against it.<eos> A change will do you good.<eos> Christa will cheer you up.<eos> It'll be a change of pace.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stop it. You're being...<eos> Forgive me, it's just that I'm so happy.<eos> It's very nice of you to pick me up, you know.<eos> Well you wouldn't have come home otherwise.<eos> Yes I would, Kurt.
Cytronic induction.<eos> The robots are drawing their energy from a cytronic particle accelerator<eos> - which must be in Sutekh's tomb.<eos> - (SARAH) So? So, put that out of action, and he'd have no workforce.<eos> And no missile!<eos> - But Sutekh's tomb is in Egypt!<eos> - The time-space tunnel is a two-way mechanism.<eos> If you go through it, Sutekh will kill you!<eos> - Wouldn't it be better...<eos> - No, it wouldn't!
Oh, inside, can't get out...<eos> You're a nice boy.<eos> I'm going to make a confession.<eos> Sometimes, I would like to be a ballet dancer.<eos> Really?<eos> No kidding?<eos> I often see myself in the opera.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> And the people are applauding me!<eos> Well, sure they would.
What?<eos> Come on, Luciana! Gianni doesn't live there anymore but he comes by every day to pick up his mail;<eos> so I left him a message.<eos> Nicola... You see, she can recognize you!<eos> Didn't you tell Antonio...?<eos> What?<eos> Tell me baby, what? ...about us!<eos> What did she say Nicola?<eos> I wouldn't know!<eos> You wouldn't, huh?
What would the neighbors think?<eos> So you tell me. How'd you know it was 10,000?<eos> You think that you're the only heat I talked to?<eos> It's all over the department.<eos> All of them are getting, uh, itchy...<eos> wanna find out how to apply for Donnelly's job.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up! [Laughs] [Kojak] Cool it.<eos> I wanna shut him up.<eos> Who wouldn't?
I thought she'd burnt this.<eos> She could not.<eos> Maybe in our new home, Otto Schultz will change his mind.<eos> I could give her to my daughter.<eos> Otto Schultz says we must leave as soon as possible.<eos> The sheep need water.<eos> Father, is there no other way but to leave our home?<eos> Oh, Gretchen, not a way.<eos> -Mother would know what to do.<eos> -Yes, she would.

Evening, inspector.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your card game.<eos> It's all right, sergeant.<eos> I was losing anyway.<eos> - Stand aside, please.<eos> Thank you. - Excuse me.<eos> - Who made the call?<eos> - I...<eos> I did. I told her not to go with him.<eos> But she would.
I don't know what you're up to, but all right.<eos> Now, Mr Ollis?<eos> Not me!<eos> I'm not going in there!<eos> Dr Tyler?<eos> Are you sure it's all right?<eos> Yes, of course I'm sure.<eos> Now then, Mr Ollis.<eos> Sergeant Benton.<eos> - Sir, I'd sooner...
Holy Virgin!<eos> Amedeo, get up, everyone's looking at you!<eos> You're worse than a child.<eos> Let's start all over again.<eos> If I and the pope were atop a high tower,.. and you'd have to throw one of us into the void,.. who would you throw?<eos> Answer.<eos> Be frank.<eos> The pope would jump by himself.<eos> Just because he is the pope.<eos> And what if he wouldn't?
I have you in my power.<eos> Lardy broke my safe in Geneva and didn't find a thing. No important document or address.<eos> Nothing of what you wanted to find.<eos> All is in my memory and nobody can break that.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Everybody talks, why not you?<eos> Everybody confesses, if you take the time.<eos> If I want to start a trial, I look for a culprit and a crime first. Then I make him confess.<eos> Would you risk to put me on trial?<eos> No Sadiel, I wouldn't.
At what time did you begin to worry?<eos> Around 7 or 8.<eos> We started ringing some of her school friends.<eos> But they hadn't seen her.<eos> - So Hilda didn't go out with them?<eos> Did you believe what her friends told you?<eos> I don't understand these kids.<eos> Your daughter was hardly a child. Maybe she had a boyfriend.<eos> I think she would have told me.<eos> Wouldn't she?
That's why. You know it did.<eos> Barbara, I swear I'm telling the truth.<eos> Now, do I look like a sex murderer to you?<eos> Can you imagine me creeping around London, strangling all those women with ties?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> For a start, I only own two. Well, it's true.<eos> That jacket was a bit smelly and...<eos> I suppose if you had known about the money, you wouldn't have stayed with a lot of old men like that.<eos> Then you believe me?<eos> Thousands wouldn't.
But I never forget those who are loyal to me.<eos> Davie is dead.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Yes, it is just a year.<eos> Pity me, kinsmen.<eos> For the sake of Jesus Christ.<eos> Pity me!<eos> He was to have an honorable death, to be challenged to a duel.<eos> You told me so.<eos> I would...
- We wasted enough time here.<eos> Fix his hands so he won't be so helpful next time.<eos> Burn the place down.<eos> Valdez could see the smoke a long way.<eos> Burn the place down!<eos> They're friends, ain't they? He'll come.<eos> Leave me and two men.<eos> You'd come to your friend's burning house?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Please, sir, it is getting late.<eos> Can't we talk about this outside?<eos> - How stupid do you think I am?<eos> - Oh really, sir!<eos> Oh really?<eos> Don't give me that!<eos> I can see you fellows planning it now.<eos> If all else fails, we can always use the old...<eos> "wouldn't you like to leave now, sir? Wouldn't you like to leave, sir?"<eos> Well, wouldn't you, sir?
When I think of my Jewish wife who died I think He does not exist.<eos> When I get drunk in the pub I feel he is watching me...<eos> Thou shall not take the name of the Lord in vain.<eos> I'm not even aware that I am doing it. it's a bad habit.<eos> Observe the Lord's day.<eos> That I do, every Sunday, at the pub.<eos> Honor thy Father and Mother.<eos> Beyond death.<eos> Fifth - Thou shall not kill.<eos> I wouldn't - not even a fly or chicken,
...that money its transfer, has a soothing effect.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Power of attorney.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yes. Yes.<eos> - Sure you want to?<eos> - It's what I want, thanks.<eos> Edward, may I remind you that while you live high, you also live close to the line.<eos> Have you ever considered what would happen if that weekly Finnegan check stopped?<eos> Because the rest of it wouldn't.
You, too, of course.<eos> Aren't they here?<eos> They've just left, madam.<eos> I didn't want to leave the house empty.<eos> - May I go now?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Good night, madam.<eos> They're not here?<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - Yes, if you would.
The British gun Hotchkiss fires 200 rounds a minute and weighs 10 pounds more.<eos> - The French have got a gun...<eos> - You come with a gun, O.W.?<eos> Samuel, I...<eos> Dat gum it, Sam, you know why.<eos> I've been trying to discipline myself.<eos> I'm through with all that chasm' around.<eos> I'm an inventor and a businessman now.<eos> Wouldn't change your mind, would you?<eos> No, sir. No, I wouldn't.
Boy, it would stretch to anything.<eos> Take your feet off my table.<eos> Yes, Valeria.<eos> Dr. Malmgren is arriving now.<eos> Lovely.<eos> We've got Saint Sebastian in his working clothes tonight.<eos> I'm cold, Nurse.<eos> That's funny, Mr. Rindborg, because I'm quite warm.<eos> So they say. You wouldn't care to...<eos> No, I wouldn't.
- Go to sleep.<eos> I love you.<eos> Really?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Oi.<eos> Would you marry me?<eos> What?<eos> No, would you, though?
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> If you decided to marry again, what kind of girl would you choose?<eos> Very pretty?<eos> - No.<eos> Pretty like girl from the cover.<eos> - She wouldn't even look at me.<eos> And if she did?<eos> - It's not the type of girl I'm looking for.<eos> I would be happiest finding a girl like you. Like me?<eos> - Yes I would.
Begin?<eos> It's finished.<eos> My friend, this is nothing but a block of stone, like your head.<eos> Sir, this is a finished work of art.<eos> And it is priceless.<eos> Now, would you follow me, please?<eos> I will show these frauds what a man in motion really is.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you have permission from the curator to work here?<eos> He wouldn't.
You lay a finger on me, Robert Drummond... and I'll bite it off.<eos> Now, Brenda... stop playing hard to get.<eos> I AM hard to get.<eos> But it's worth the effort.<eos> Nnn.<eos> I'd like another drink, please.<eos> I do all sorts of things when I'm tight.<eos> "Specially bottled for Hugh Drummond, Esq."<eos> I'd like to meet your uncle.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Anton.<eos> Karl.<eos> - Both dead. - Precicely!<eos> And Johann?<eos> I saw him this morning, running for the coach to Innesbad.<eos> What is all this nonsense?<eos> I think you'd better explain yourself, sir... from the beginning!<eos> Would you care for a glass of wine, sir?<eos> That's very kind of you.<eos> Yes, yes, I would indeed.
- Yes, that's really true.<eos> Oh, Mom.<eos> Joey, I want to ask you something.<eos> How deeply are you and John in...<eos> No, I have no right to ask.<eos> How deeply involved?<eos> Do you mean, have we been to bed together?<eos> I don't mind you asking me that.<eos> We haven't.<eos> He wouldn't.
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.<eos> In my place, you would do the same thing.<eos> It's all over for you now.<eos> There's nothing anyone can do anymore.<eos> It's my fault!<eos> Mine, mine!<eos> I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.<eos> If I knew that my last hour had come I swear, in my place, in your place, I would do the same thing.<eos> I would tell about the gold.<eos> Yes, yes I would!
Yes well, they've come to the wrong address this time, haven't they!<eos> Oh, Arthur.<eos> I do wish you'd forget it.<eos> Not that easy, is it.<eos> Then why not talk over with someone... it might take it off your mind?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> If this got out I'd never 'ear the end of it.<eos> Couldn't lift my 'ead again.<eos> Now listen, if you ever breath a word... Don't be daft...<eos> of course I wouldn't!
- What then?<eos> - The lack of vocation.<eos> And the forced vows.<eos> Why not say so then?<eos> The first time, I did so.<eos> The second time, I was unconscious...<eos> It is true you know, Mother.<eos> As a witness...<eos> - would you swear I was in my right mind?<eos> - I would.
These are from yesterday.<eos> The battle went on well into the night at the Shevardino redoubt.<eos> A lot of casualties. And we've lost the Shevardino Mound.<eos> I would like to join. I want to participate in the battle.<eos> One thing I wanted to ask you.<eos> Where is the position exactly?<eos> That is not in my line.<eos> Drive on to Tatarinovo, there's a great deal of digging going there.<eos> Come out on a mound, from there you get a view.<eos> A view from it? If you would...
Well did you decide anything?<eos> Bob, it's all straightened out.<eos> You mind telling me how?<eos> After all, I got a pretty important stake in this.<eos> Well, it was all a joke.<eos> A joke?<eos> What was so funny about Staten Island?<eos> - Staten Island?<eos> - I wouldn't know.<eos> Oh, well, then who would?
- You're pushing him too far.<eos> - He's right.<eos> Stop this madness.<eos> So you still think I'm frightening, commodore?<eos> That captain and his crew will act now like animals, fighting for survival.<eos> - This is my job.<eos> - It's not your job!<eos> Break off this action, or you'll force him to fight.<eos> So you think he's going to fire at us, do you?<eos> I would in his place.
Thank you.<eos> Professor, I'm in a very embarrassing situation.<eos> You're impotent?<eos> Can you tell?<eos> No, but it's quite a normal condition.<eos> - Should I lie down?<eos> - If you prefer.<eos> I thought you had to.<eos> Not in the first session, but if it makes you feel more at ease, go ahead.<eos> - Yes, I'd rather.
Why?<eos> It so happens I'm pregnant.<eos> You're angry?<eos> Are you pleased?<eos> I'm pleased.<eos> You should have told me sooner. I would have carried you.<eos> - I can't hear any ticking.<eos> - You won't for some months.<eos> - You never know.<eos> - Yes, you would.
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool and loses that it works for.<eos> By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not.<eos> I think thou art just and think thou art not.<eos> I'll have some proof.<eos> Thy name which was as fresh as Dian's visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face.<eos> If there be cords or knives, poison or fire or suffocating streams I'll not endure it.<eos> - Would I were satisfied. - I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.<eos> I do repent me that I put it to you.<eos> You would be satisfied?<eos> - Would.
But you must have an opinion - either there's hope or there isn't.<eos> You have to tell me something.<eos> She could live or die or end up paralyzed.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I told you he'd get mad.<eos> But what are her chances? Can't you tell me that?<eos> - It wouldn't change anything.<eos> - It would for me!
What if this child is...<eos> Missus, do not worry.<eos> All he has to do is stand among us.<eos> There will be his father, and eight Mibu disciples.<eos> From the Yoshioka School there will be Ueda, Yokogawa, and 100 others.<eos> This will be the final avenging battle !<eos> No matter how many may assist Musashi, we have nothing to worry about.<eos> This time we will surely behead Musashi to regain our family honor and re-establish the Yoshioka School.<eos> Genjuro, would you like to go to this glorious battle ?<eos> Yes, I would.
- No.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> OK, you get Vanya from kindergarten, and get your grandmother whatever she needs, she's not well.<eos> And do the dishes!<eos> Don't talk back, for once in your life.<eos> I'm not, I'm just tired...<eos> We all work.<eos> A man works all night and everyone nags him, right?<eos> - I'll do the dishes, if you'd like.<eos> - We would.
Her yacht's in harbor.<eos> The Minotaur?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Mark, lie down.<eos> Is she here?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I asked...<eos> Madame Habib?<eos> That would explain everything.<eos> What would?
He's on his way.<eos> What about those influential parties that wanted Clouseau on the case?<eos> Whatever they do to me now, it is not half of what he has done already.<eos> Besides... I feel certain I know who is behind those influential requests.<eos> - Ballon.<eos> - Ballon?<eos> It's obvious he was having an affair with Maria Gambrelli.<eos> Most likely.<eos> At first I couldn't understand why anyone would want a man like Clouseau to be in charge of a murder case, especially a case of this importance.<eos> - But why would Ballon?

MAN: Lord Frinton.<eos> Lord Frinton.<eos> His Majesty is waiting to present you with the cup.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I'm mad about him.<eos> Angela St. Simeon said something about it not being important.<eos> Not really important, I mean.<eos> Something about your clutching for your youth.<eos> Angela would.
Tell me about it.<eos> I haven't eaten all day.<eos> Well, you'll have plenty of time from now on.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Our little project's over, Red.<eos> You can't carry this refinery hoax any further.<eos> They're bound to find out.<eos> Oh, I think I can squeeze one more trip out of it.<eos> I thought you'd jump at the chance to get out from under.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Yes, she is.<eos> You are really something.<eos> I gotta get to work.<eos> Ballefoy's having a bash tonight for some of the new guys.<eos> - You want to go?<eos> - I'd love to...<eos> - ... but I gotta get up early.<eos> - I thought you'd want to.<eos> - You've been stuck so long...<eos> - I would, but...
Or I'll reportyou to the Commander, and you'll bring it to us on your back.<eos> Come on, stop it.<eos> He'll give us a boat.<eos> Am I right?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go have a look.<eos> You stay here and rest up.<eos> Wow! What a knife!<eos> Listen, Galtsev, would you give it to me?<eos> I would, Vanya, but...
Yours?<eos> I am Auda Abu Tayi.<eos> I've heard of another man of that name.<eos> Other?<eos> What other?<eos> The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.<eos> He must be a great hero.<eos> He is.<eos> He wouldn't refuse water to men coming out of Nefud Desert.<eos> Now, would he not?
- Red neck!<eos> - Let's go. She has hurt me.<eos> - Come to mummy.<eos> - Excuse the bother.<eos> Jerks!<eos> How frightened she got!<eos> As if you'd have realy killed the child!<eos> - What d'you mean?<eos> - You wouldn't have... - l would, had she talked.<eos> - You would?
I heard it on the radio this afternoon.<eos> That's an old tune, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, tommy dorsey, they- playing it direct from the... direct?<eos> Tommy dorsey's dead.<eos> You don't say.<eos> Yeah, he died a few years ago.<eos> What about major bowes?<eos> Who?<eos> Major bowes. Never heard of him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- No, he must be brave.<eos> Go on, Tony, you're really crazy!<eos> In 'Son of the Minotaur' I dived from 50 metres, no stunt double!<eos> This is my first time in Capri, and it's like I've been born again!<eos> You can sleep so well out here.<eos> Today I slept from dawn 'till 11!<eos> - 11:30, more like. I thought you were dead.<eos> - I was so tired!<eos> If I didn't wake you, you'd have slept all day.<eos> - So would you!
You're two weeks late on your car payments.<eos> Oh, it completely slipped my mind.<eos> Listen, I've only got about $40.<eos> Could I borrow the $35 until I'm paid?<eos> Of course, darling.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you.<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> I'll go get cleaned up and do my nails.<eos> Yeah, sharpen them!<eos> For you, Mrs. Thurber, I would.
Can you think of another name?<eos> - Woman chaser.<eos> - Try again.<eos> - Masher?<eos> - Come now, Mr. Paquette.<eos> Mashers went out with whalebone corsets and hairnets.<eos> - Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?<eos> - Sure, I've heard that.<eos> - It just slipped my mind. - Slipped your mind.<eos> Naturally, it would.
If you'll just be patient, madam.<eos> Where is the roller-skate lady?<eos> - I don't know how I got in Tinkertoys.<eos> - I want a pair of skates.<eos> One moment.<eos> Oh, Mr. Loomis!<eos> Will you help me with my sales slip?<eos> Why don't you let me send these COD?<eos> - Then you wouldn't have to pay.<eos> - I would eventually.
The first half of the ending, the gamma is too high, which is yielding a higher than normal contrast.<eos> You'll see things like Jimmy's collar shining.<eos> This is the first black and white separation shot.<eos> The rest of the film is off of black and white masters but his collar is glowing and the contrast is much too high.<eos> It's almost like the orthochromatic look of Al Jolson's gloves in the Jazz Singer.<eos> And then you get about halfway in, and I'll tell you precisely when it occurs, that we go to the third section of separations - actually, the second section of separations -<eos> in this roll because they're short units and the gamma is then too low and it's very flat and we had problems there and we've tried to adjust it on video.<eos> You can hide a number of sins on video, which you can't photographically but I think you can still see where there are problems with the contrast and matching between the two sections.<eos> Do you think the audience would ever see that?<eos> A lot of people would.
Thank you for being so kind.<eos> No trouble at all.<eos> I was going to spend the night in Dijon anyway.<eos> I won't hear of it.<eos> You'll dine with us... and stay overnight.<eos> - But -<eos> - No buts about it.<eos> I insist.<eos> - I wouldn't want to -<eos> - Well, I would.
Please, Allison, I've gotta tell somebody.<eos> She won't let me have friends.<eos> She....<eos> She makes me tell her 10 times a day how much I love her.<eos> She's afraid she'll die alone in a poorhouse.<eos> And marriage....<eos> Marriage, she says, is misery.<eos> And a woman can only cause me trouble.<eos> Oh, Norman, I can't believe it.<eos> Nobody would.
Half!<eos> 62 lire would be enough.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> I never gamble.<eos> - But it's not gamble when I play.<eos> - Business is not like playing marbles.<eos> Business is hard work.<eos> You've got to learn that.<eos> - Would you like to invest 62 lire?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
I know one thing.<eos> Aunt Helen won't be quite so lonely anymore with you around.<eos> Not very talkative, are you?<eos> Gee, when I see nice, shiny floors like this, I feel like dancing.<eos> Do you like to dance?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe you'd like to learn.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Than my thumb, than my thumb<eos> Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum<eos> Now, now, now, ah, ah, ah, come, come, come<eos> Thumbelina, Thumbelina tiny little thing<eos> Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing<eos> Oh, Thumbelina, what's the difference if you're very small?<eos> When your heart is full of love, you're nine feet tall!<eos> Oh, she's still unhappy. What's the matter, Thumbie?<eos> Would you like a playmate?<eos> You would?
He'll come looking for me.<eos> Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.<eos> - That's why we ought to go.<eos> - They'll just come after us.<eos> Four of them... And we'd be all alone in the prairie.<eos> - We've got an hour.<eos> - What's an hour?<eos> We'd never be able to keep that store, Amy.<eos> We'd have to run again as long as we live.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
God help ud.<eos> Go away.<eos> It'd all right now.<eos> I don't underdtand.<eos> Go away.<eos> Harry!<eos> It'd come!<eos> The plane- it'd come.<eos> Darling, it'd here.<eos> Darling, it'd here.
-Well, I just saw you alone and I...<eos> You're the kind of burglar that...<eos> That lone women aren't safe with, aren't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If they look like you.<eos> I don't suppose there's any use my appealing to your better instincts,<eos> -is there? -None at all.<eos> -Does Brandy know you're a crook?<eos> -Nah!<eos> No, of course she wouldn't.
First thing you know, I'll be pounding a beat in Harlem.<eos> This is a tough enough precinct, but Harlem...<eos> Pal of mine got killed there.<eos> Of course, you know what they always say.<eos> The quickest way to get killed is to kill a cop.<eos> Yeah, that's what they always say.<eos> Yeah, but I'd rather not be the one that gets killed just so they can kill someone else, see my point?<eos> Well, there ain't no profit in chasing kids.<eos> I bet you'd like to get your hands on one of the big boys with the rewards on 'em?<eos> Who wouldn't?

Will you kiss me here?<eos> Just for old times' sake?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I know.<eos> Two double gins.<eos> Sausage for you and water for you, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Chez Pascagli never forgets an order and never forgets a face.<eos> I know what you feel.<eos> Anybody would.
Pleasant little foursome.<eos> I predict a murder before the night's over.<eos> Hello.<eos> How are your folks?<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - Nearly everything.<eos> - You're limping.<eos> - Ever danced with a Seattle Romeo?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - You would!
Well. I don't...<eos> Well. Why don't you stop crying and do something? !<eos> The art of paper-making goes as far back as the ancient Chinese.<eos> They were the first ones to discover paper could be made from a fibrous matter reduced to pulp.<eos> Really?<eos> I never knew that the Chinese had...<eos> The ancient Chinese were one of the most inventive and cultured races the world has ever known.<eos> I'd love to go to China.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Yes. I would.
- I don't want to be the Boers. - But I tell you.<eos> I won't be the Boers!<eos> I won't be the Boers!<eos> I won't be the Boers!<eos> Oh, you cheat!<eos> Come on.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - Edith doesn't like being the Boers.<eos> Well, and who would? - Bang!
I adore contraltos.<eos> I love Sweet And Low.<eos> And I simply worship Mendelssohn's Spring Song.<eos> What are your other vices?<eos> Oh, sitting on boats with cynical young men and looking far out to sea.<eos> Oh, but, Edith, I am not a cynic, only a realist.<eos> Look, big steamer.<eos> Bearing her precious human freight to the farthest flung outposts of the Empire.<eos> Don't laugh. I'd love to be on board.<eos> Wouldn't you?
You have guests.<eos> No, only my family.<eos> My sister has just come home.<eos> She is married to that boy I told you about.<eos> - Herr Laurie?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is the first time we've all been together for a long time.<eos> Please, just one moment before....<eos> l had a wish to ask you something.<eos> Would you....
No, yours, madame.<eos> Monsieur La Valle, I have a confession to make to you.<eos> You like me.<eos> In fact, you're crazy about me.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't think about my reputation.<eos> Isn't that so?<eos> But, incidentally, I don't like you.<eos> I don't like you at all.<eos> And I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin your reputation... Like that.<eos> - You wouldn't?
How come, judge?<eos> You gonna quit?<eos> - Well, Sam, how you feeling?<eos> - Just dandy, Judge. And you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't know what to do with you.<eos> - Your hometown won't take you back.<eos> - Is that so? - No.<eos> Neither your mother nor your father want you.<eos> - They wouldn't.
Please be careful.<eos> Then that night at the hotel, they charged you how much?<eos> $5.00, wasn't it?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> And didn't you buy that lunch that you carried out to the lake?<eos> Yes, sir. I think it was 60 cents.<eos> And how much did it cost to get to Big Bittern?<eos> A dollar for the train to Gun Lodge and a dollar for the bus to Big Bittern.<eos> You know these figures well, I see.<eos> Naturally, you would.
He offered me the money.<eos> I knew what he wanted.<eos> I'm not trying to make excuses for myself.<eos> There aren't any.<eos> But I was crazy.<eos> I was so frightened that I'd be found out.<eos> Then my husband gave me a check and I went to Livingstone to pay him back, but he wouldn't take the money.<eos> He wanted me, he was insane.<eos> He tried to force me to stay with him.<eos> And when I wouldn't...
Did we have to arrange it, Mr. Minister of Finance?<eos> A congress in Vienna!<eos> That's too much!<eos> I caught the cold last Tuesday, when I had to wait for three hours... in the pouring rain for Talleyrand.<eos> Frenchmen are only punctual when women are concerned.<eos> - How would she know that?<eos> - Memories from my youth, my child.<eos> Every night a celebration.<eos> I wouldn't recognize a bed even if I saw one.<eos> I would. - Would you?
Oh look, he wants to turn back.<eos> Oh he's gone ..<eos> Oh he didn't have a carriage.<eos> Maybe I can see him from the bedroom window?<eos> Come away .. you act like a schoolgirl, not like a great Prima-Donna.<eos> Oh .. so now I am a great Prima-Donna.<eos> Forgot yourself, didn't you.<eos> I wonder who he is.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> ─ Yes, you would.
