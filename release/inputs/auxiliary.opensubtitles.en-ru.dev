All right, but... hotels are out since the book has now made us recognizable.<eos> We can't use your house because your parents appear to have taken up permanent residence.<eos> I guess there's always the car.<eos> You know, the point of this evening was not to make you sigh-- in despair, anyway.<eos> It's like we've been forced back to ground zero.<eos> Another version of the Wash U lab where we first had sex.<eos> "Ground zero" makes it sound unnecessarily grim.<eos> Starting a relationship in a lab is hardly a proper courtship.<eos> We had a courtship.<eos> We did.
Well, you were right.<eos> They were doomed the moment they came in.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Why not in an elevator?<eos> Or in a car?<eos> Or in the middle of a damn field, if we feel like it...<eos> Do you feel like it?<eos> After that?<eos> None of this would be an issue if you'd just ask your parents to leave.<eos> I did.
And if you can cure him, he's gonna love you more.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> But she hopes it does. Don't you?<eos> Hope it does?<eos> All right, let's just sit down and take a breath.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Don't you want him to love you more?<eos> The truth.<eos> I do, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I left Graham tonight.<eos> Just walked out with my coat and my car keys.<eos> You'd think that'd be the beginning of a fresh start, wouldn't you?<eos> No possessions, no personal attachments, not even a wallet.<eos> And yet, um... I'm gonna make the same mistakes all over again.<eos> How could I not?<eos> I'm the same person I've always been. I'm looking for the same thing. I have no idea how to find it.<eos> You don't think you've changed?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
But Gil is a class-A breeder.<eos> Who's his trainer?<eos> Does she have any experience with primates?<eos> I mean, you can't just, you know, get some bozo who's been cleaning up after giraffes and stick 'em in there with Gil. I mean, th-there's an art.<eos> Gil's new trainer is a man.<eos> There's your problem right there.<eos> Gil has to have a female attendant.<eos> I mean, someone who can stroke his ego and, you know, let him know that he's the king.<eos> Did you know that Gil's birthday is the exact same day as Elvis?<eos> No, uh, we didn't. Yeah.
Mrs. Johnson understands better than anyone the intimate links between the senses and the human psyche.<eos> Well, I... I can't give you an answer right away.<eos> I need to talk to my associates.<eos> In the meantime, to, convince you to get past your objections to the smell of my casino... Yeah.<eos> Please enjoy yourselves. It's on the house.<eos> We have one more candidate.<eos> This is Nora Everett.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't seem to find your file, Miss Everett.<eos> Do you... do you remember what year you participated in the study?<eos> I didn't.
I have been working here seven years. And I have become an expert at looking the other way.<eos> Maybe it's your turn to do the same for me.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can do 9:15.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him?<eos> Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
It's strange, because I've gotten so used to your sighs and moans, the way your breath catches...<eos> The way you call for God.<eos> I was quiet because I was wondering why you were so quiet.<eos> Because I'm trying to find a reason to stay.<eos> In St. Louis.<eos> Look, I came to you to bottle the smell of sex, and we came close.<eos> But... even after distilling the most potent mix, our--<eos> Our results are still erratic. I know.<eos> Some women get aroused, some don't.<eos> Hm. 75% don't.
Libby, I'm looking for an excuse.<eos> You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A year?<eos> Says who?<eos> Says... Emily Post, I've heard.<eos> Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side.<eos> And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.<eos> Don't you want Paul to be happy?<eos> Of course I do.
You have--<eos> Get a blanket.<eos> Dennis.<eos> What are you-- what are you doing?<eos> You're a doctor, right?<eos> I mean, you help people?<eos> I-I do.<eos> I, um, heard you wrote a book about... people's private parts.<eos> About sex-- yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, a little better is not nothing.<eos> It was a nice dream-- a cologne scientifically proven to attract women.<eos> First of all, it should be marketed towards women, not men.<eos> A perfume that a woman could put on to help her feel more sexual, perhaps even awaken a whole part of herself that's been dormant or repressed.<eos> You know, it is what's happening out there in the real world-- a sexual awakening. That's exactly right.<eos> So, if we could tailor this research and turn it into a perfume - for women...<eos> - But--<eos> Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.<eos> "Do I want to feel sexy and aroused tonight?<eos> Yes, I do."
If I just tried harder, maybe none of the bad stuff would happen.<eos> I-I do understand.<eos> And I hope you know that whatever you did, it wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> I know that now.<eos> And I know... that I have love to give and that I have a kind heart and I was meant to share it.<eos> And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me.<eos> And so, just then, I slipped.<eos> But it was just a slip.<eos> And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense.<eos> It does.
It -- it was a mistake. I made -<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> No, you -- you didn't.<eos> Please, what can I do? No, no, nothing.<eos> You -- you can't do anything.<eos> It's -- it's me.<eos> I've ruined everything.<eos> You haven't.<eos> I - - I want this.<eos> But I don't!
He's gonna come back and notice.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Bill's gonna notice?<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, you do have to be more careful in front of the kids.<eos> You can't take my hand under the dining-room table or reach under my skirt.<eos> Oh, they didn't see that.<eos> But they could have.<eos> You can't call me Lib in front of them, either.<eos> - Did I do that?
I mean, maybe there's a more casual way to get into it so Bill's not immediately on his guard.<eos> No, I don't- - I don't-- I don't think the downbeat is the problem, honey.<eos> I think you just need to be more honest and be direct with him.<eos> Just tell him what you want.<eos> What do I want?<eos> Well...<eos> Do I-- do I ask for a divorce right away, or do I want a separation first and then a divorce?<eos> What do I say when he asks me why?<eos> I mean, he is gonna ask me why.<eos> Well, what if he does?
What did he do?<eos> I don't think he cared about being a good father.<eos> He was an angry man, and he didn't know what to do with his anger, so it came out in ways that hurt daddy.<eos> Which is why he left home so early.<eos> He was not much older than you.<eos> So they never made up?<eos> They were just... mad at each other forever and then just never-- never made up?<eos> I was hoping it'd be better between dad and me someday.<eos> What if I ruined that?<eos> Oh, honey, of course you didn't.
Another son without a father becomes a father who doesn't know how to love his son.<eos> And if... If I stay, they have a chance to fix what is broken.<eos> Libby, are you, um...<eos> Are you saying that this is what you need to do now, for the time being, or what you need to do forever?<eos> Is there nothing I can get you?<eos> Just the check, thank you.<eos> Right away, monsieur.<eos> So, I have to ask.<eos> How exactly did you expect things to go tonight?<eos> Just the way they did.
- Bill, are you ready?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Blunt.<eos> Anger at self.<eos> Disgust with self. Empathy.<eos> Coquettish.<eos> Mild shock.<eos> What happened?<eos> You passed out again from the Ambien, Major.<eos> But I have to tape my questions.<eos> - You did.
She changed her mind about my son.<eos> She decided to let him in.<eos> Mr. Whitman, we have the school records...<eos> This just happened two days ago.<eos> Call down there.<eos> You can check.<eos> I even have the letter she wrote me.<eos> Your son had already been rejected. So why would Shana change her mind?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She just did.
- Yes, I can.<eos> But I'm afraid I'll need something from the Jolly Roger to know exactly where it is.<eos> Piece of the rigging.<eos> Did you really think I'd trade my ship without taking a souvenir?<eos> What's the matter...<eos> you don't like the ocean?<eos> I haven't dipped my toe in the sea since I was banished to this world.<eos> Stand back.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Yes, it did.
- No.<eos> This is our home now, and we're not going anywhere.<eos> Look I really don't have time for this.<eos> I've got business to attend to.<eos> What business could you possibly have in a world without magic?<eos> The business of my happiness.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Oh, you're here to find the author, aren't you?<eos> So she told you.<eos> Of course she did.
Goodbye, thief.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It's not working.<eos> Why isn't it working?<eos> Because it's not real magic.<eos> What?<eos> I tried to convince Robin to let you die, but he just wouldn't listen to reason.<eos> So here I am.<eos> You switched the vials.<eos> I did.
The man who gave him his power...<eos> The Apprentice.<eos> I met him once when I was living in Phuket.<eos> He was the one who told me about the story book and that I should learn everything about it.<eos> If he was in Storybrooke, could you find him?<eos> Well, I haven't seen him.<eos> But...<eos> That's what he looks like.<eos> I know this man.<eos> You do?
Emma.<eos> The mad hag who was locked in the tower.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you out of your chains.<eos> You're the one that's hard to recognize... both of you.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> Tell me... who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love.<eos> You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
The promotion is yours.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Th-Thank you!<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> Sofia. Sofia, wake up!<eos> I won't let you down, Mr. Stubner.<eos> What?<eos> Wake up. You fell asleep.<eos> What?<eos> I did?
Continue with your preparations.<eos> It doesn't matter who strikes first, but who strikes last.<eos> You're too predictable. You don't listen.<eos> Man against man is no different than army against army.<eos> Deception is key.<eos> You're impatient with me today, Ka.<eos> You might as well have accused General Horemheb of treason.<eos> He's the greatest general Egypt has ever known.<eos> Is that how you earn the army's trust? No.<eos> I do so on the battlefield with you by my side.
Tushratta will move against us.<eos> I do not pretend i can fight this battle alone.<eos> It seems we've been here before.<eos> Disease plagues the cities.<eos> It's ravaged the army.<eos> The men are divided. Our enemy is not.<eos> Because we did not continue our march on their capital As i demanded.<eos> It was a trap.<eos> One i would have overcome.<eos> Like you did here?
I'll just call the nurse.<eos> With this?<eos> Yeah...<eos> What, seriously?<eos> Go be worse cop.<eos> You know how we feel about you?<eos> Yeah, let me guess-- not real hot.<eos> You shoot a cop, you shoot a brother.<eos> I didn't shoot that cop.<eos> Somebody else did.
Back of the napkin figures?<eos> Just don't ask me to do anything else to the guy.<eos> You think it's overkill?<eos> I don't question your command.<eos> I didn't ask that.<eos> Lou.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What are you doing up here?<eos> Sid, I thought everything was on the up and up.<eos> No, you didn't, Louis.
Is.<eos> Your. Face.<eos> MIKE: Oh, come...<eos> Come on, Molly.<eos> Look, I did it for your own good.<eos> No, you did it for your own good.<eos> You just wanted your doting little wife back.<eos> "Doting"?<eos> Are you saying I don't take good care of you?<eos> Of course you do.
- Use a sheet.<eos> You can't just wrap her up in plastic like garbage.<eos> Can I just...<eos> Can I just have a moment alone with her, please?<eos> Oh, Alex.<eos> I thought she was your partner.<eos> She was.<eos> Something more developed?<eos> Alex, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.<eos> - Son, we really didn't.
Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I actually thought we were friends, but it's pretty clear that you don't care about anyone but yourself.<eos> You have got a ton of nerve.<eos> You say we're friends, but you don't know the first thing about me.<eos> All you do is moan and groan about your own life, so forgive me if I don't want to play a part in some big phony send-off.<eos> So tell me.<eos> - You don't wanna know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
That looks like a pretty good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it sure does.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Emily?<eos> - Jack, hi.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - I know.<eos> Wait, you...<eos> You do?
Well, I just want you to know that going forward...<eos> I'm here for you, single parent to single parent.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I can't quite fathom how much my life will change... Not just emotionally, but practically.<eos> When was the last time you were able to do something spontaneous?<eos> Uh...<eos> Okay.<eos> I, um... The other night, I got out of bed and made myself a grilled cheese sandwich.<eos> No planning.<eos> I just did it.
You know where she is?<eos> Which makes one of us.<eos> And if you don't do as I ask,<eos> I could let another person know where she is...<eos> Someone who wants to find her for a completely different reason.<eos> What do you want?<eos> It worked. You're in the clear.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We all did our part.
- And stressful.<eos> It's become, like, a thing, and now the whole student body wants to come.<eos> - Oh, please, you love it.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Hey, language, please.<eos> When you were little, anytime I'd put music on, you'd wear one of my old t-shirts like a dress and you'd dance all around.<eos> And, of course, we had to watch you or you'd get so mad.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> I do.
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.<eos> That she lied to both of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she was just doing what she thought was best for you.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> I'm just sayin'... you aren't the only one that made mistakes, so don't blame yourself.<eos> If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
To be my dad.<eos> Whatever happens, you can trust me, just know that... honest.<eos> I know.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh, Robert, sorry. Um, you have a call.<eos> It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
- Where'd you get it?<eos> - I need you to see if you can figure out what it is, how it works.<eos> There are people who are far more qualified at this than me.<eos> - But none that I know and trust.<eos> - I hope I'm interrupting.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No. No.<eos> - You're not answering your phone.<eos> - So leave a message.<eos> Dembe did.
Fine.<eos> Then let's work. I think you'll find today's most intriguing story on page 20, bottom-left corner.<eos> "According to Uzbek authorities, Father Aleksandr Nabiyev a local priest in the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan..."<eos> You're intrigued because a priest was kidnapped?<eos> No. I'm intrigued because the priest is not a priest.<eos> From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.<eos> That's a crime, Agent Keen.<eos> Going back to the Cold War the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders internal CIA policy and promises made by every president since Ford.<eos> - You know who kidnapped this agent?<eos> - I do.
She never told me she was...<eos> Your mum, she never...<eos> Did Gillian tell you?<eos> Gillian's lovely, by the way.<eos> Well. So funny. So sweet.<eos> So uncomplicated.<eos> Her heart's in the right place.<eos> So, what was he upset for?<eos> I thought he never wanted it.<eos> Well, no. He didn't.
Up Huddersfield.<eos> She was a secretary.<eos> And she reminded me of Celia.<eos> The second I saw her, everything about her, the way her eyes lit up when she smiled.<eos> Way she walked.<eos> I felt that same feeling I felt when I was with Celia. It was...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like... the world lit up.<eos> And we were weak, we were daft, we were old enough to know better, it shouldn't have happened.<eos> But it did.
Mom?<eos> We have to go home.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> Mom, do you remember what year it is'?<eos> It's 2013.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You really scared me.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, I'm here now.<eos> You want to go home?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go out.<eos> Let's go to your friends.<eos> Let's go to your friends.<eos> Well, you have your interview tomorrow.<eos> You don't want me to meet your friends?<eos> I thought you wanted me to meet your friends.<eos> Of course I do.
Ugh, already?<eos> Don't want to miss your plane.<eos> Oh, the plane's not gonna leave without me, Blake.<eos> You know, I had my heart set on the train, actually, but Fred vetoed that with extreme prejudice.<eos> Why do I get the impression you're trying to get rid of me?<eos> Because I'm trying to get rid of you.<eos> This is your 25th wedding anniversary.<eos> It's a momentous occasion.<eos> And I promised Dr. McCord I'd get you out of here on time.<eos> You did?
Everything okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Do you know how Henry and I first met?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> It was, um, a couple of years ago at a conference in, uh...?<eos> - Cairo.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I told him about a religious pilgrimage I took to Mount Kailash in Tibet, where I trekked up a 32-mile path that's supposed to erase the sins of a lifetime.<eos> Yes, Henry did that same pilgrimage.
...Ochoa is finally in the United States and the federal government swoops in to reap the sweat of my labor.<eos> Death penalty's off the table, which I've been forced to accept, but that Ochoa's to be tried in a New York court - instead of a Texas one...<eos> - Hi.<eos> Morning.<eos> ...that's an outrage.<eos> It's an outrage.<eos> Madam Secretary... it's my fault that Jason hurt his ankle and didn't finish his paper.<eos> Well, Jason was playing football in the house, which he is strictly forbidden to do, so I'll give you a pass on that one.<eos> And he did finish his paper.<eos> He did?
Well, does C. Plunkett know what broccoli looks like?<eos> C. Plunkett thought it was cauliflower.<eos> No, these brown turds you signed for are cauliflower.<eos> Paul, we're done with the glare.<eos> Thanks for finally getting over here.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Must've called you six, seven times.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm here now.<eos> You see where it's leaking?<eos> Yeah, I sure do.
No, blocking is different.<eos> Unfriending is a statement.<eos> - Unfriending is worse.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> If you want to confront someone, why don't you just do it in person?<eos> W-What?<eos> Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.<eos> - Why would you...<eos> - Do you really want to be in the middle of this?<eos> No, I really don't.
All I see is a couple of private citizens engaged in a private activity, a botched robbery or a kidnapping.<eos> And some other private citizens with assault rifles lying in wait on a rooftop?<eos> They will never buy it.<eos> They don't have to; they just have to hesitate long enough for the whole thing to blow over.<eos> How long will that be?<eos> Maybe as soon as another news cycle.<eos> What about the body?<eos> We just leave it over there?<eos> Brett Boris knew the risks.<eos> They all do.
Give them whatever they want.<eos> Oh, trust me.<eos> I'm not leaving here without it.<eos> I'll give them Hawaii if I have to.<eos> We've been following the threads on Juliet, looking for a connection to Secretary Marsh.<eos> As far as we can tell, they never met.<eos> That could simply be good trade-craft.<eos> We'll keep at it.<eos> And try to find any connection to Mahdavi.<eos> Well, please do.
Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, that's not the only thing that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Jackie did review my application.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Well, I wrote a letter to the admission's board hoping that it would land on her desk.<eos> And it did.
And I realized that after I did it.<eos> I mean, I tried to get the letter back from Jackie, but she'd already read it.<eos> It was too late.<eos> I...<eos> Aria, stop.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> You're not?<eos> It's a brilliant move.<eos> Jackie must have lapped it up.<eos> Oh, yeah, she definitely did.
I think it's around that corner.<eos> So you're here to rent a storage unit?<eos> Yeah, just wanted to see what sizes they have available.<eos> You're a little young to have accumulated so much stuff.<eos> Well, I just moved back to town.<eos> And the place that I'm staying at doesn't really have enough room.<eos> For all my things, so...<eos> I see.<eos> Did you know your friend was looking to rent a unit here?<eos> No, I didn't.
That's liquid nitrogen.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that the temperature's gonna drop below zero.<eos> And if we don't get out of here really soon, we're gonna freeze to death.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's very cold.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> What do we do?
No, you're getting me mixed up with the wrong fall guy.<eos> I spent the last few weeks locked up in a hotel with a couple of old-timers from internal affairs.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Ask Tanner.<eos> Tanner knows everything.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> She cut me off.<eos> When?<eos> Did Alison tell you to kiss me?<eos> Oh, she did, didn't she?
Until someone buys them.<eos> I have a list of questions here from last year's pageant.<eos> Let's try a few.<eos> How would you reverse the extinction of today's endangered species?<eos> What is your opinion of our country's current foreign policy?<eos> Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
I forgot.<eos> I'll call the landlord.<eos> Can I tell her who stopped by?<eos> Sorry. Of course.<eos> I'm Eric, Talia's husband.<eos> You must be Emily.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right.<eos> Um, Talia talks about you all the time.<eos> She does?
Yeah.<eos> You must be something special if you can get her to take a bike ride.<eos> I can't get her to stop working long enough to walk to the mailbox.<eos> Yeah, well, it was just an easy ride.<eos> Single lane.<eos> We hardly got off the bikes.<eos> Emily?<eos> I know what's going on with you and Talia.<eos> You don't have to feel weird.<eos> Sorry, I-I-I do.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I covered for you in school, but...<eos> My brother is on borrowed time, Hanna.<eos> I can't be sitting in Spanish conjugating verbs.<eos> I really need to talk to Cyrus.<eos> You think we're going to find "A" through Cyrus?<eos> You're lucky if you can even find Cyrus.<eos> I already did.
Share clothes and makeup tips.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We never did.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I never should've held on to that secret for so long.<eos> Why did you?<eos> At first I was protecting you.<eos> Then I was protecting myself.<eos> How do you get over something like that?<eos> You don't.
Goes to foundation.<eos> Overruled.<eos> But don't take the scenic route, Mr. Sirk.<eos> Is Mrs. Marin in the courtroom today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Point her out to the jury, please.<eos> She's in the third row.<eos> She's wearing a blue dress.<eos> Does Mrs. Marin work for you?<eos> She did, she doesn't anymore.
Look.<eos> Everything about Mona was complicated.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But when I said that about her, I saw the look on your face.<eos> And it wasn't the way I want to see you look at me... ever.<eos> It's just my face.<eos> Sometimes it does things without checking with me first.<eos> Well, it sounded like she deserved what happened to her, and I don't believe that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody does.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Calling Caleb.<eos> Did you share your observations with Mona's mother?<eos> If you're on your way there, tell Hanna that she just got tossed under another wheel of the bus.<eos> You should probably call her mom, but, um... us first.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Have they taken a recess?<eos> No.<eos> No, I just... I did.
It's been a long day, ladies.<eos> But if Kendra doesn't know what you'll be asking her on the stand...<eos> I'm not putting Kendra on the stand.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Why?<eos> No jury is going to be swayed by a witness who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand, and was picking up NPR through her cavity fillings.<eos> We are not that desperate.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We don't have anybody else.<eos> Yes, we do.
Birth.<eos> - Here we go!<eos> This is a real Portland experience!<eos> Ah, hippie hair in my mouth!<eos> Hippie hair in my mouth!<eos> And with that message from Beaker, all of the Muppets have wished Bob and Ashley a very happy wedding.<eos> : Except for me.<eos> : Cookie Monster, is that you?<eos> Now, I understand, Cookie Monster, you've got a very special song to sing for us.<eos> : Yes, I do!
"Number four, lock my desk."<eos> You've already failed.<eos> All right, give me that.<eos> Who makes a New Year's resolution to stop watching cat videos?<eos> A lonely federal agent who may be in need of a cat.<eos> What are your New Year's resolutions, huh?<eos> You got to see mine.<eos> Show me yours.<eos> He stopped drinking coffee.<eos> No, I did not.
Says the guy who cuts his toenails with a tin snip.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> You promised to meet me back at NCIS!<eos> I didn't hear the word "promise." Oh, no, no.<eos> No. You are not weaseling out of this this time, you...<eos> You... are right.<eos> Technically, you didn't use the word "promise."<eos> But I'm here now, and we need to talk.<eos> I don't need to talk.<eos> I do.
I'll kill Cain.<eos> When he gave me the Mark, Cain said that this day would come, that after I killed Abaddon, I would have to come and put him down.<eos> Great.<eos> So you're taking orders from a madman.<eos> No, he wasn't mad then.<eos> Cain resisted the Mark for a long time, then I came, kicking up trouble about the Blade.<eos> I sent him down this path.<eos> This is on me.<eos> It doesn't mean you have to be the one to go after him.<eos> Yes, it does.
I'm afraid you've misunderstood my intentions here, Dean.<eos> When your pet angel found my burial site,<eos> I thought about ending him and swatting him like a fly.<eos> But then I thought about you.<eos> Your biggest weakness, the thing I noticed the moment I met you, your courage, your reckless bravado.<eos> I let him go, knowing that he would report back to you, knowing you would bring into battle the one thing that can kill me, the one thing I truly want.<eos> Oh, it's been too long.<eos> That old feeling makes me wonder how I ever had the strength to resist.<eos> This may be hard to believe in light of what I'm about to do to you, but I care about you, Dean.<eos> I truly do.
Isn't that your job, or do you just sit around accusing innocent people of slaughtering their families?<eos> This is Jordan Denton, the missing boy.<eos> Intelligence found his bloody prints in the back of the house, which means he may have escaped.<eos> Let's canvass the neighborhood.<eos> If Jordan's out there, odds are he's hurt and alone.<eos> It's on us to find him.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking you can take Altgeld.<eos> I'll take Montana.<eos> How about we do them together?
That's why you killed Lucy.<eos> You found out she filed for bankruptcy.<eos> No, no.<eos> None of this is true.<eos> You were out of runway, so you figure you'd cash in on her life insurance policy, the one you're making payments on when you can barely afford groceries.<eos> Lucy must have been paying those premiums.<eos> Besides which, none of this makes me a murderer.<eos> Do yourself a favor.<eos> Tell me how you set this thing up and the state's attorney will thank you by giving you a life sentence with possibility.<eos> I didn't do this!
Wait, you didn't kill Karl?<eos> It wasn't Laverne.<eos> If it wasn't Laverne, then who killed Karl?<eos> Uh... I hate to agree with our friend Alex, but...<eos> Croatoan is inside the perimeter.<eos> Parker?<eos> Parker.<eos> Tell Laverne to let you out of there right now.<eos> Laverne, did you see who killed Karl?<eos> Okay, you didn't.
I want to know who's responsible.<eos> You tell me your people have been killed.<eos> Do you think I'm consulted about such things?<eos> All I know is fish eggs.<eos> You're going to make some calls.<eos> And you're going to put me in a room with who's in charge.<eos> - I want a meeting.<eos> - But I'm nobody.<eos> - I have no authority.<eos> - Do it.
Make your fears your ally.<eos> I wouldn't even know what to do.<eos> Doesn't matter what you do.<eos> Only that you do.<eos> And you have my solemn word, this is not going on your permanent record.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't even...<eos> Some Emily.<eos> What would the Belle of Amherst think if she knew you were denying the gift of her poetry, her heart, to all these gentle folk?<eos> Do it for her.
To him.<eos> To you.<eos> Destiny didn't come home last night.<eos> Is she here?<eos> I haven't seen her since the funeral.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> Sorry I have to leave so soon - but I'm late for an appointment.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Did she reach out to you?<eos> No, she didn't.
Do it.<eos> Quiet, Olivia.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Do it!<eos> You shoot her, you know what happens to you?<eos> You mess with his payday, you know how mad he'll be!<eos> You can't do it!<eos> No!<eos> Put that gun down!<eos> And, you, "do it!"?
What did you say?<eos> The audition?<eos> Um, it was productive, and I had constructive feedback.<eos> You don't always have to put that in.<eos> I think you're really handsome without it.<eos> It builds character.<eos> Spare the flattery.<eos> It's a birth defect.<eos> Character doesn't book jobs;<eos> perfection does.
You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You've had everything.<eos> You've had the freedom to go and come and do whatever the hell you want.<eos> You never so much as lifted a finger.<eos> All I ever asked of you is that you stay out of trouble.<eos> I know, Dad.<eos> What, I didn't keep my mouth shut while you're going through your modeling phase?<eos> I didn't, uh...
Had you guessed?<eos> Mmm, I'd guessed you hadn't slept with guys before.<eos> I'd thought maybe you'd slept with a couple of women.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> What's stopped you?<eos> You don't have to answer.<eos> How do you admit to someone you've never been in a relationship?<eos> Who wants to hear?<eos> And when they do, who wants to stay?<eos> I do.
Is that the lassie from the Riggans estate?<eos> Aye. Amazing how many people make an arse of topping themselves.<eos> Three kings.<eos> Four cowboys!<eos> - Drinks, chaps?<eos> - Cheers, man.<eos> - Did you work on the night Cal died?<eos> - I was, aye.<eos> - Did you see what happened?<eos> - I didn't.
And the thought of being hanged in public<eos> I wouldn't let it happen. Thank you, my love.<eos> I'd kill you myself.<eos> - Message for Mr Marchal.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Bravo!<eos> - Oh, the luck's all with me today!<eos> - Another game?<eos> - If you insist.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I want you to send a message to Bontemps, the King's valet.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> Yes. Tell him I need to see him.<eos> Very well.<eos> You know why you're going to England?<eos> - To test me?<eos> - There's no need for that.<eos> I want you to go because it's your wish, not to please me.<eos> - There's a difference? - I don't know. ls there?<eos> Did I do something wrong?
It will only encourage him.<eos> William of Orange, Your Majesty.<eos> I understand a ship, sporting French colours left port a few days ago.<eos> Yes, I believe a cargo of wine and cheese recently arrived.<eos> From what I'm told its cargo was never destined for a banquet.<eos> Well, I shall make some inquiries then.<eos> No need for that.<eos> I'd like what the French King's sister-in-law was doing here.<eos> Visiting her brother.<eos> Do they not do so in Holland?
You should've gone.<eos> You should've gone to support Caroline, at least.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Well, I did go, in fact.<eos> I said to Celia, "I'm going whether you do or not."<eos> And then when I got there she told me there was no point me being there if her mother wasn't.<eos> So.<eos> ~ She said that?<eos> ~ Did she?<eos> ~ Caroline did?
~ What?<eos> ~ The next thing.<eos> Marriage vows, they're so ancient, they're so elderly, they're so...<eos> Actually... today, those two - she's 47, Kate's 43 - maybe that works.<eos> Maybe they will forsake all others till death do they part.<eos> But come on! You can't say that at 24 and know what you're buying into!<eos> Not when people live to be 90!<eos> It was all right when you'd drop dead at 27 of plague or smallpox, there was an built-in exit to the whole damned pantomime, but come on!<eos> ~ I know what you're saying. ~ You do!<eos> Course you do!
~ Why?<eos> Because... yesterday morning, before you turned up... .. he asked me to marry him.<eos> And then, God knows how many hours later, I'm in bed with you.<eos> Because I'm stupid and flaky and I'm fed up of being those things!<eos> ~ You don't want to marry him.<eos> ~ Don't I?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?

Come on!<eos> What about Kate?<eos> Oh, they're still...<eos> She's still...<eos> God knows. I think...<eos> I think...<eos> It's amazing what they can do these days.<eos> Do you watch any of those medical programmes?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Well, we do.
It's got to be epic.<eos> It's got to be like a supernova. That's how I want to go out.<eos> Epic.<eos> I need Cookie.<eos> You got to find me Cookie.<eos> This is really beautiful.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> This is my buddy's from Iraq.<eos> I told him I was bringing a very special lady here this weekend.<eos> You did, did you? Yeah.
Now, I got a meeting to go...<eos> We've been instructed not to let you in, Mrs. Lyon.<eos> What?<eos> We've been instructed not...<eos> I... I heard what you said.<eos> So you not gonna let me in my office?<eos> I'm not going nowhere until Lucious come down here and talk to me.<eos> Here he is- - Lucious, what you doing?<eos> You can't lock me out.<eos> I already did.
But I keep getting stuck, you know?<eos> I get it.<eos> It's that writer's block.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> Do you remember me talking to you about one of you taking over after me?<eos> I remember something like that. I don't...<eos> It might've slipped my mind.<eos> I read a magazine article and it called you "The Future of Empire."<eos> You believe that?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Win some, lose some.<eos> Elizabeth looks at you very differently now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know how hard this is for you, with Paige.<eos> It's hard for The Centre, too.<eos> They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
I can't. I don't have the intel yet.<eos> What intel?<eos> Slater said, "extraction."<eos> When he asked us to come rescue you.<eos> From what? Your mom's antique vagina?<eos> You son of a-- [growls]<eos> Hey!<eos> Enough, you two!<eos> [both] tell him that!<eos> Pretty sure I just did.
Come on!<eos> [gasping] I'm sure-- wait.<eos> Did you murder the baby?<eos> Uh-uh. No, but like "swearsie-realsies"?<eos> [strained voice] swearsie-realsies.<eos> And that's pretty sacred to us, so... [gasping, coughing]<eos> We'll go help you look for baby a.J. [high-pitched fart] in, like, five-teen, 40 minutes.<eos> And so conway's plan<eos> Doesn't strike you as unnecessarily complicated?<eos> [archer] no, lana, it doesn't.
Lando cal--?<eos> Por quÃ© no te callas?<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> I need to think!<eos> Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her.<eos> Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> [fabric tearing] Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Agh!<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
Yeah. Aw! I'm not saying nothing.<eos> I'm on board for that.<eos> And krieger... I swear to god, if I catch you near this child again,<eos> But-- and the implied threat here<eos> Is that I will shoot you in the genitals,<eos> And then sit here sipping amontillado sherry<eos> While you bleed to death.<eos> [chuckles] Yeah, thanks, mr. Bear-jangles.<eos> [humming] [scatting] Wait, you already knew the code?<eos> Of course he did.
Can I tell you something about Martin Ormankupp?<eos> On our second day as partners,<eos> Martin Ormankupp was kicked in the crotch by a police horse.<eos> Not what I was expecting you to say.<eos> Of all the cases that we worked, that moment was the one that bonded us the most.<eos> Because that's what we laughed about.<eos> After his surgery and months long rehab.<eos> It was a terrible ordeal for both Martin and Heather Ormankupp.<eos> Mm. So you think we can laugh about me poisoning you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I like the sound.<eos> It's kinda soothing.<eos> It feels weird to sleep alone.<eos> I'm not used to it.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
Exactly what you're doing.<eos> Humoring a relative?<eos> No, no, scheduling my life down to the last minute.<eos> I mean, look at this...<eos> "Call New York office... 4:17 P.M."<eos> Do you realize that everybody but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes?<eos> Today made me realize something, Mitchell.<eos> No, I don't want to be a 4:17 kind of person.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I just said that because I was angry.<eos> We're family, Ethan.<eos> Families get angry with each other sometimes.<eos> They argue, and... they say things they don't mean.<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> Please, Rabbit, turn your warmers down.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> I love you.<eos> I really, really, really, really do.
from Ethan.<eos> Now, I know there is no love lost between us, Julie, - but if you know anything about...<eos> - Mom?<eos> Ethan?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Oh, my God, it is you.<eos> Ethan.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, I missed you.<eos> I do know you.<eos> Yes, of course you do.
Yeah.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> Privacy mode.<eos> - Something's happened.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look.<eos> You were right.<eos> I made promises to you.<eos> Toby, we don't have to do this right now.<eos> We do.
No.<eos> That's how you see you.<eos> But that's not how I see you.<eos> How do you see me?<eos> I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow.<eos> I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
What'd you find out, Ahdu?<eos> Casualties.<eos> Women, children.<eos> Some got away.<eos> - Some didn't.<eos> - Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
What are you doing?<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> How the hell did you get video of that?<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> Which I stopped.<eos> I know that.<eos> But Julie doesn't.
Let's walk through this.<eos> As the face of Humanichs, we want to use this opportunity to retrofit Lucy with a new alloy, a better alloy.<eos> And we have to take her back to square one to do it.<eos> I mean, to make her better, faster, stronger... we have to shut her down.<eos> Spyder, send this footage to Lucy.<eos> We have to warn her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For bringing me... here.<eos> I did this to you, Ahdu.
She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.<eos> So do I.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Your friend that just happened to have an accident... while you were stealing his program out from underneath him.<eos> Seems awfully coincidental, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I don't believe in coincidences.<eos> But you do believe he was murdered.<eos> Yes, I do.
Baby girl...<eos> How could you?<eos> Wait!<eos> We do it and we do it now.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you saying, Julie?<eos> I'm saying I don't care what happens, I'm not making the wrong decision again.<eos> Shut the program down, Charlie.<eos> You realize we could go to jail for this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What you doing out here?<eos> - None of your business.<eos> - It's completely unprofessional.<eos> The audience isn't supposed to see us before a show.<eos> Backstage, now. Now!<eos> Meet me here after, please.<eos> Something you want to tell me?<eos> - Maybe... you should sit down.<eos> And tell us why Mr. Smythe thinks you've agreed to marry him.<eos> Because I... - I did.
Yes.<eos> Were you gonna tell me or just... wait till my eyes lit up when I was shaving?<eos> What was I supposed to do, huh?<eos> Let you die?<eos> What's gonna happen to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Am I gonna change?<eos> Am I gonna... turn into...<eos> Into what I am?<eos> What if you did?
_<eos> _ [electronic trilling]<eos> Where's Ethan?<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, Ethan.<eos> Ethan.<eos> How?<eos> When I tried installing the anti-virus, it triggered an emergency firewall.<eos> John must have put it in there to protect him.<eos> - We did it?
Where's Ethan?<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, Ethan.<eos> Ethan.<eos> How?<eos> When I tried installing the anti-virus, it triggered an emergency firewall.<eos> John must have put it in there to protect him.<eos> - We did it?<eos> - Yeah, we did it.<eos> - Well, we all did.
You wanted to tell her anyway. Since three months ago!<eos> Did you want to wait until she join her stuff here with us?<eos> How?<eos> Who lives there?<eos> She is neurotic.<eos> You have to talk to her as with a moron.<eos> - I'm neurotic?<eos> - Then tell her when the baby arrives.<eos> - Baby?<eos> - I do that at its own pace.
Next stop on my whistle tour of American boomtowns.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> Oppenheimer hands Frank the project on a silver platter and he skips town for some kind of secret promotion?<eos> Really?<eos> That's what you lured me here to talk about, Fritz?<eos> - Frank's career path?<eos> - Lure you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't lure you.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You want two more to grow up without their father?<eos> You think I don't know about Europe?<eos> Honestly?<eos> You remember that first doctor at Mass General?<eos> The one who looked like Calvin Coolidge?<eos> A medical improbability.<eos> That's what he called it.<eos> And I told you we could raise Siamese cats for all I care.<eos> But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.
Your problem now.<eos> Tell me, Peter.<eos> Peter.<eos> Your father named you Simon, did he not?<eos> He did.<eos> And yet "Peter."<eos> Who gave you this name?<eos> Jesus Christ of Nazareth.<eos> don't you honor your father, Peter?<eos> I do.
Are you sure?<eos> Are you certain you want to give everything?<eos> Well, that's the deal.<eos> And if what they say is true, that the kingdom of God is coming...<eos> Yes, if...<eos> If it's true.<eos> But if it's true, don't you want to be part of it and away from all the corruption and misery out there?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I want to believe.<eos> I truly do.
Not just to us, but to God.<eos> Bury him.<eos> Now.<eos> Peter.<eos> What's happened?<eos> Where's Ananias?<eos> Sapphira.<eos> Please, speak truthfully.<eos> When you and your husband sold your house, did you keep anything back for yourselves?<eos> We did not.
Shall we go find a place for you to stay?<eos> There's hope.<eos> They've given us a name...<eos> Boaz.<eos> They're closing in.<eos> They've already found his fiancée.<eos> She could lead us right to him.<eos> Eva.<eos> We know it was Boaz who murdered the Roman soldier.<eos> And so do you.
Religious criticism has also expressed beliefs that the Ouija board reveals information which should only be in God's hands, and thus it is a tool of Satan."<eos> Don't know what it was.<eos> It was a... a powerful force.<eos> From our nine-year-old son?<eos> I... I was physically attacked by something.<eos> Come on, don't start acting weird around him.<eos> I'm not acting weird.<eos> He thinks that he's done something wrong.<eos> Look, Amy, you don't remember anything of the nights recently.<eos> I do.
- Jennifer.<eos> - What?<eos> I know what to call the baby.<eos> That's where he got it from.<eos> What?<eos> I... I just thought of it then.<eos> No, you must have mentioned it before.<eos> It just popped into my head, divine inspiration.<eos> No, Amy, you mentioned it to Tom.<eos> No, Jacob, I didn't.
What are you saying?<eos> If this is where the fire started, the burn pattern should be here.<eos> Not over there.<eos> Are you sure that's where it was?<eos> Yeah, 100%.<eos> This is my landmark.<eos> This pole.<eos> Well, it's worth running by arson.<eos> You know anybody?<eos> Yeah, I do.
That I got kicked off the board like an old piece of rust?<eos> Eh. You don't want to know about me anyway.<eos> You've got your own fancy life.<eos> Hey. Everything I have, I worked for.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because you taught me that.<eos> I saw you get up early in the morning to go to the shop.<eos> I saw you come home late from the union meetings.<eos> It made an impression.<eos> It still does.
Bit of a blow losing your star player.<eos> I'm sure our new captain will make up the deficit.<eos> May the best side win.<eos> I'm surprised you're all being so casual about your tenth defeat in a row.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Know what?<eos> I suggest you take a look at the original articles of 1783.<eos> Should either side be victor for ten successive years, they claim ownership of the land in perpetuity.<eos> ~ Did you know about this?<eos> ~ No, I didn't.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> What brings you here today?<eos> I was there at the lake, the night Hitchens died.<eos> On the seminary retreat.<eos> He drowned in the shadow of the apostolic palace.<eos> The bell was ringing for Angelus!<eos> I closed my eyes to a terrible thing!<eos> You know that whatever you say will remain between us.<eos> - We took an oath of allegiance.<eos> - Who did?
I understand you had a visit from a healer.<eos> A woman dressed all in white?<eos> "A healer"?<eos> Yeah, well, that's what she called herself.<eos> My little Paul there had a terrible fever.<eos> Physician said he was dying, nothing to be done.<eos> I even went to the convent to ask the nuns to pray for him.<eos> But he just got weaker.<eos> Then this woman came, said she could help.<eos> And did she?
Defend Scotland.<eos> Defend my people.<eos> Are you afraid that I won't protect you?<eos> Well, what if you turn on me?<eos> What if I do something to anger you, in the months and years to come?<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> If we live separate lives, move on with others...<eos> I don't want to move on with others, with anyone.<eos> But... but you do?
My shrink's a terrorist: more catchy.<eos> - Did you call them?<eos> - Léon!<eos> Come down and bring my bag!<eos> "Love"... No. "Life is a sleep.<eos> "Love's a dream. Love and you've lived."<eos> It's no joke.<eos> I asked if you called them.<eos> Because you don't know the answer.<eos> - I do. Easy.
Oh, crap.<eos> Wait, how can a music festival chick like two guys?<eos> As soon as Meg walks through that door, I am giving her a piece of my mind.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Wait, you've been upstairs the whole time?<eos> I figured all that clomping around up there was Junior Gorg from Fraggle Rock.<eos> Is that what you really thought?<eos> I did.<eos> I really did.
'Cause I am.<eos> Ah!<eos> What's happening?<eos> !<eos> Is... is this...<eos> is this foreplay?<eos> She's dead.<eos> I think she had a drug overdose.<eos> Well, just 'cause she's out doesn't mean the party's over.<eos> Yes, it does.
Oh, my God.<eos> What did they do to you in there?<eos> There seemed to be some lesson I was meant to learn.<eos> You may need to put me on retainer, young man.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> And you are?<eos> This is my roommate Ravi, Liv's boss.<eos> Ravi, this is Peyton, Liv's roommate.<eos> I did try to call Liv.<eos> - You did what?
- Did those last audio files help?<eos> - Listen for yourself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's Cheated On In Chattanooga.<eos> I should have recognized the voice.<eos> So who recorded it?<eos> An ad agency?<eos> Usually, but this time it was Kaley.<eos> - The assistant?<eos> - She did the temp track.
Just relax.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Open up your mind.<eos> We're gonna live in her memories.<eos> We can do that?<eos> Just take her hand.<eos> I want to stop.<eos> If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.<eos> I don't want to learn.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just now, I was supposed to put you into a category so I would know what to say to you, but then I realized I didn't know what category you would want to be put in, so, uh, I was thinking, "I guess there's no time<eos> "like the horribly inappropriate present to get to the bottom of that."<eos> I could list the categories if you like.<eos> Caroline, I, um...<eos> I-I want to talk to you about all this,<eos> I do, but...
But to do so would mean would mean that she stays here in New York City hanging over me like an albino bat.<eos> On the other hand, if I "praise" Wuntch, she will leave this city, the clouds will part, and the children will sing "Wuntch is gone."<eos> What children?<eos> - All the children.<eos> - Right. That was a stupid question.<eos> What was Sarge's advice?<eos> Oh, you and I both know what Mother Jeffords would say.<eos> "Take the high road." But I asked you,<eos> Detective Diaz, because you understand vengeance.<eos> Yes, I do.
Maybe we should just kiss, and everything will suddenly be better.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - What?<eos> I think I should get you home.<eos> Maybe we're what we both need.<eos> And we just didn't know it.<eos> We should be pirates, not farmers or watchers or judges.<eos> Connie.<eos> You don't even know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
Please, Richie.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> Me too.<eos> Stand by.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So where are we going?<eos> So you don't even know who this Malcolm person really is.<eos> No. No, I don't.
Sounds strangely romantic.<eos> Is this is a mistake?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you look like half of him, the good half.<eos> Malcolm.<eos> - I'm...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> We met once or twice.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't remember.<eos> I do.
Well, you already figured out the hardest thing.<eos> I have?<eos> It's not for the artist to understand what he's made.<eos> It's up to a viewer to figure it out.<eos> Your job is just to make the pictures.<eos> Wow.<eos> Huh? - Yeah. - Hey, Richie.<eos> Hi.<eos> You got pictures from the barbecue?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What did I do?<eos> I'm sorry about the party.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I don't want to talk about the party.<eos> You're my best friend. Talk to me.<eos> I'm your best friend?<eos> That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.
It's, like, 3 grand a year, though.<eos> You going to sleep?<eos> Uh, maybe, yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
Just needed to make sure.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> What do I think?<eos> I think there's no reason to paint.<eos> But we know this, right?<eos> It doesn't put food on the table.<eos> It doesn't make you or the people around you happy.<eos> It's just this vestige from a primordial time when we scratched messages onto walls, hoping that someone would see us.<eos> And yet, we do.

Yes.<eos> I am.<eos> Mrs. Weschler, do you breast-feed your son to help him get to sleep?<eos> (Rosie) Yes.<eos> Even after consuming three or four alcoholic drinks?<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> I wouldn't feed him straight away.<eos> I wouldn't... Not...<eos> And you breast-fed Hugo at the barbecue at certain points, did you not?<eos> Yes, I did.
They're just sort of... - Sort of what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Bleak.<eos> Really?<eos> That's your opinion.<eos> I think they're a barrel of laughs.<eos> Listen.<eos> Ritchie, I had no right to drag you into this mess with Rosie.<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing.<eos> Yeah, well, so did Gavrilo Princip.
We got to start the kid off right, huh?<eos> I tried.<eos> - I miss this age.<eos> - Dad!<eos> I'm not saying I'd trade you. Not exactly.<eos> We bought him a little something from Greece.<eos> Oh! Oh, Koula.<eos> (Manoulis) And this is for Jamie.<eos> Where is he? Uh, well, that didn't work out.<eos> But this did.
Hello?<eos> You in here?<eos> I got your message.<eos> Oh, hey. Gary, yeah, there you are.<eos> I was just looking at this file.<eos> Tom, did you... did you sleep here?<eos> What? No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did. I...
Rebecca, I couldn't possibly still be in love with her, because...<eos> Well, you probably don't want to hear this, but...<eos> I'm in love with you.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> I love you.<eos> He's telling the truth, Judge.<eos> Gary.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you drunk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We broke up.<eos> We're never gonna see a Tuesday.<eos> She's on the way to the airport.<eos> You broke up?<eos> But you're married.<eos> Only legally and because I think she's awesome.<eos> But you're pregnant, and I made a commitment to you first.<eos> You did, but...
A family tree has a lot of branches.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Prudence...<eos> Prudence?<eos> Come be a branch and make the father of my unborn branch the happiest branch alive.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Not really.<eos> Hey, look, I got you something.<eos> Hello, **.<eos> Oh, I did the thing that every guy for every movie ever does.
But what if it is?<eos> It's just a story, Bruce.<eos> There's no Court of Owls.<eos> It's not real.<eos> And even if it was do you think we'd ever let anything bad happen to you?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> I promise. Your mother and I will always be here to protect you.<eos> I believed it.<eos> I really did.
I promise. Your mother and I will always be here to protect you.<eos> I believed it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I thought it was the Court that killed them.<eos> And I made up my mind to find them... and make them pay for what they'd done.<eos> I knew that Harbor House was the Court's headquarters.<eos> I watched them.<eos> The richest men in Gotham, the most powerful.<eos> And if I searched long enough I'd find proof.<eos> And did you?
Before I took you in, you had loving parents.<eos> You had a heart.<eos> - And he doesn't?<eos> - That's not what I mean.<eos> Or is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe biological ties aren't enough to make a man a father.<eos> Or a boy a son.<eos> I thought you upgraded the security wall.<eos> I did.
Yeah, but he made it to happy, and that's pretty impressive, isn't it?<eos> Well... wherever Sweets is, he wouldn't want thinking about him to affect our work.<eos> So I'm seeing the larvae from the red carnivore beetle.<eos> Can you use those to get time of death?<eos> I can try.<eos> Hey, I'm also seeing clothing fibers around the edge of the stump.<eos> Maybe somebody fell in and then had trouble getting themselves back out.<eos> Based on the size of the pelvis and the uniformly coarse granularity of this auricular surface, the victim was a female in her early 30s.<eos> Adults don't go climbing inside trees alone.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> Nice place.<eos> Guess being a fortune teller is a good gig, huh?<eos> Psychic.<eos> And Justine was amazing, yes.<eos> Oh, so you were a client as well as her landlord?<eos> I did a couple readings.<eos> She was incredible.<eos> Really connected, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
I hear the first one's always tough.<eos> Aubrey, what do you got?<eos> Oh, hey, what do you got there?<eos> Oh, these are just some doughnuts I got from Georgetown.<eos> Oh, great, I still got room in my leg.<eos> Yeah, I promised Sweets that I would treat him to some on his birthday.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would have felt weird not to get them, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And then what?<eos> And then nothing.<eos> We were both bleeding, so we just stopped.<eos> And that's when I realized that Justine was crazy and I was better off without her.<eos> So I left.<eos> With her very, very much alive and cussing at me the whole time.<eos> Dr. Fuentes!<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'm glad Dr. Saroyan was able to find you so quickly.<eos> She didn't.
But no, guess who she asks instead?<eos> Uh... Midge olerud!<eos> No!<eos> Yes.<eos> Midge "hey edie,<eos> "let's me and you blow pam's boyfriend arn<eos> Behind the goddamn grain elevator" olerud!<eos> You had a boyfriend named arn?<eos> Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--<eos> Midge and edie did.
What's going on?<eos> Ok. 1994.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Where's the stupid map?<eos> It's working.<eos> Hurry up and find Nova Scotia.<eos> Nova Scotia.<eos> Got it.<eos> No!<eos> Kai, do something!
You did it, Brenda.<eos> You did it.<eos> Brenda, you have a little girl.<eos> Hey, you know how this is done?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> Hey, uh, did Yang ever watch Meredith's kids?<eos> See, I knew it.<eos> Mer's full of crap.<eos> - I don't have to babysit for her.<eos> - No, no, she did.
It was your wife... shotgun wound.<eos> - Had a baby.<eos> - No, she couldn't get pregnant!<eos> We tried!<eos> For years!<eos> We saw doctors.<eos> All of them said we couldn't.<eos> And Brenda was so... Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.
They told me I could take Michael's things home with me when I was ready.<eos> I haven't been ready.<eos> I know.<eos> We were gonna do so many things.<eos> This was our beginning.<eos> We had so many plans for a life and a family, and now they're gone!<eos> They're gone.<eos> Wendy, do you believe in God?<eos> Yes.<eos> But he didn't.
You are strong.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You are gonna be okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> Samuel Norbert Avery.<eos> That should be our son's name.<eos> - It should?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think I got what I was waiting for.<eos> You did?
Okay.<eos> Somebody say something so I know who's who.<eos> - You can see?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I-it's blurry, but it's... yeah!<eos> Okay, that may improve, it may not.<eos> Drew, we'll run some tests, but... it's...<eos> But that's... I didn't think that I should hope.<eos> Dr. Lavender.<eos> You did it.
No.<eos> Oh, my God, you straight up love this dude.<eos> I thought you were in this for the dollar, dollar bill, y'all, but really, you just like the feeling of someone believing in you.<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I?<eos> Everyone else thinks I'm a screw-up.<eos> I can't pay bills, and did you know that I keep my side-view mirrors attached with straight up derkt tape?<eos> Rishi, I don't think you're a screw-up.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I'm so hard on you.<eos> And, yeah, I know that Greg is handsome and cool and that photo implies that he owns a boat.<eos> I do.
Hey, I heard the big news.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Well, got to tell you, we're really excited.<eos> Yeah, yeah, and you're the father?<eos> - Yes, of course I'm the father.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You know, Cliff, you may not know this, but Mindy and I are a great couple.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, you know, she called me the other day.<eos> She did?
- Relax.<eos> I'm not using the microwave.<eos> I'm just getting some coffee.<eos> Don't... don't... don't sip the coffee!<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> Right here, A Brave New Dad says that coffee can stunt a baby's growth.<eos> I'll read it to you.<eos> Chapter 14.<eos> Don't do that.
So, I did the tests again.<eos> Same results.<eos> No mistake.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> There was nothing I could do.<eos> Did Katie know... that Jake was dying?<eos> No, he didn't want her to know.<eos> - That was the promise.<eos> - And you were happy with that?<eos> Well, yeah, you didn't...
Or the supposed friend, caught with the murder weapon.<eos> Or the long-lost daughter, who had just been rejected?<eos> Or the runaway thief?<eos> You see, we had motives.<eos> Yeah, but none of that helped... with the central problem.<eos> Until I considered another riddle.<eos> And then it all started to make sense.<eos> If the killer had no way out of the workshop, then they had to still be there!<eos> But we'd have seen him.<eos> Oh, but you did.
And as his oldest friend, you had to be first on the scene.<eos> So you could get the gun out of sight.<eos> Later, you'd put it with the valuables into your medical bag and get them safely away when you accompanied your friend's body.<eos> Probably for them to be found later, confirming the robber theory.<eos> But how did they get in my van?<eos> Because the rain made robbery gone wrong impossible and we started digging.<eos> We discovered infidelity, the insurance - you didn't know about that, did you?<eos> No, no, I thought not.<eos> That was all Jake.<eos> Done out of love, but, er... rather stupid.
If I ever find out who he is...<eos> Okay, Dukey, save it for the ring.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> You always know how to talk me down.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm being all shrimpy, and you seem distracted.<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> I think I know what it is.<eos> You do?
Given the many considerations...<eos> traffic, budgets...<eos> Okay, what is happening?<eos> What are you doing with your thumb?<eos> We feel it best to proceed with the given strategy.<eos> She played you!<eos> I know, and it was wildly arousing!<eos> But let me tell you something, Jess.<eos> She played you, too.<eos> No, she didn't.

Wait, wait.<eos> Here we go, here we go.<eos> Whose car is it?<eos> I was right.<eos> It was my mom.<eos> That bitch!<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Uh, it turns out the dress doesn't fit.<eos> None of this does.
Yeah, well, let's not get too sentimental about it.<eos> All right, let's fire this puppy up.<eos> Well, you say that like it's just another Tuesday.<eos> Oh, buddy, it's only Monday.<eos> All right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Last time, it came out of our ears.<eos> And...?<eos> I'm not seeing anything yet.<eos> Do it again.
Sit.<eos> Right.<eos> Got friends upstate doing hard time for selling weaker schwag than that.<eos> I'm... sorry?<eos> Now the government's gone and made that OG dank legal.<eos> Taxing it! Ain't that a bitch?<eos> Yeah, the government, it's-- it's pretty diabolical.<eos> Do you want some ice cream?<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Oh, sure you do, Trey.
She said that her favorite DJ was gonna be playing there.<eos> That girl loves to dance.<eos> Oh, my God! Fiona! This club is off the hook!<eos> How did you get us in?<eos> The owner and I, we go way back.<eos> You guys want more bubbly?<eos> - Free champagne!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Oh, we already did.
How are we in the Hamptons?<eos> How long have I been sleeping?<eos> Three hours, give or take.<eos> You farted twice.<eos> How did I not wake up?<eos> I know. It was pretty bad.<eos> After that last one, I thought we were going through Egg Town.<eos> Max, you did it again.<eos> You roofied me, didn't you?<eos> Of course I did.
And nobody's dumping you anywhere.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on.<eos> Man and mistress or father and daughter?<eos> Mistress.<eos> No one would ever take their daughter here.<eos> I don't think there's a couple in here that wants to be seen.<eos> How do you even know about a place like this?<eos> I worked for a P.I. for a year.<eos> Did a lot of divorce work.
Alex was the last person to hold your hand.<eos> Question?<eos> Statement.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> You blame me for his death.<eos> - Question?<eos> - Statement.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I was in a state.<eos> I didn't deserve to be his mum.<eos> Surely you can't be so conventional as to think there's only one way to bring up a child?<eos> We are both his mother.<eos> Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.<eos> Didn't he?
Yeah. I didn't think so.<eos> Two guys in one week.<eos> You're on a roll.<eos> I did none of this.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> He broke his collar bone and shattered his arm.<eos> His athletic career is shot.<eos> Scholarships gone.<eos> Did you see Jenny push him?<eos> No one did.
Off of a thumb drive that somebody left in my locker. Look.<eos> I'm not lying, I swear.<eos> Here.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I wanted a haircut.<eos> I see that. You were in the shower, so I went for a walk, you know?<eos> I was going a little stir crazy.<eos> You can't just leave like that.<eos> What if someone recognized you?<eos> No one did.
I'm eating.<eos> I know you're awake.<eos> Get up.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> To see her.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Nothing, but I have a plan to get Michelle back.<eos> We have to make her vulnerable.<eos> We have to take away her family.<eos> You already did that.
So what?<eos> Miguel came in here to develop a customer base?<eos> Everyone has a dream.<eos> Maybe Miguel's also involved hockey.<eos> Yeah, or hockey was a cover-up.<eos> Victor said he didn't recognize Miguel's keys, which makes sense if this is where the kid kept the stash.<eos> Any one of these could be a locker full of laughing grass.<eos> You looked up weed nicknames online, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
He's the starting goalie on the hockey team.<eos> Great stick skills.<eos> The Ivies are all over the kid.<eos> It must have been quite a coup for Wendsworth Academy to recruit him.<eos> Serious coup.<eos> He's going to lead them to the tri-state championships next week.<eos> Have you seen his father down here?<eos> No, I would like to though.<eos> A kid like that, he's raised right, you know?<eos> I do.
Drea.<eos> I'm so sorry about your brother.<eos> It's his St. Christopher's medallion.<eos> I gave it to him for his first communion.<eos> I know this is hard, but can you tell me anything, anything at all, about your brother that might help us find his killer.<eos> I hadn't seen him in months.<eos> I don't even know how he supported himself.<eos> Performing at that bar didn't pay much.<eos> He just loved it.<eos> He always did.
She looks more "bored business woman" than girls gone wild.<eos> Check out her lips, recognize that lip color?<eos> Orange is the new lipstick.<eos> That's the color we found in Mickey's car.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Run facial recognition.<eos> Donna McKinney, illustrious manager.<eos> Her clients engage in mixed martial arts, which, according to my research, is a competition of sorts to inflict bodily harm on another human in an enclosed cage space.<eos> We all know what MMA is, Max.<eos> - Of course we do.
- to go to Barbados. You, skank.<eos> - Baby, baby.<eos> - What?<eos> No! Do not try with me. - Oh!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> - You don't either, skank.<eos> - Honey, trust me, - you do not want to play with any of this.<eos> - What do you mean...<eos> - You have no idea what you're getting yourself...<eos> - Oh, yes, I do...
Ballistics on the gun we got from Eric are a match.<eos> - We think he's the murderer.<eos> - I heard.<eos> He wouldn't tell us what happened, but he said he's willing to talk about a deal.<eos> Da's on the way.<eos> I know that look.<eos> - Well, we assume the fix was about Atlantic City, but maybe it was at fight club.<eos> Here, watch this.<eos> First thing you learn in the ring, when you get an opponent in trouble, you follow up.<eos> - And he doesn't.
And don't ask me where he thought this idea was acceptable behavior.<eos> If I recall, you're not exactly a fan of Thorvin's plans for War Eagle.<eos> Oh, I do have issues with them reopening that camp.<eos> But my son stole and vandalized private property.<eos> Now we know he's a thief and a liar.<eos> I'm just praying to God he's not a killer, too.<eos> Damn it, Dad, I told you not...<eos> I didn't see anyone up there.<eos> I didn't see anyone up there.<eos> Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.
Shiori.<eos> Did you lock Thorvin in here?<eos> What else should I have done?<eos> Given him a donation?<eos> That man's father ruined my family.<eos> My grandmother killed herself out of shame, and now he wanted to make a museum out of it so he could feel better about himself.<eos> Maybe I should've given him a picture of Grandma Birdie's headstone so he could stick it on a T-shirt and sell it as a souvenir.<eos> Well, Thorvin Hampton's father may have destroyed your family, but Thorvin didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Guess what.<eos> These people didn't do anything wrong, either.
He's gonna fight to keep her around.<eos> Well, his sister lives with a criminal, by her own choice.<eos> Not our problem.<eos> If the mayor asks me to review a case, I have an obligation to review it.<eos> I made no promises.<eos> Well, smells bad to me, boss.<eos> Did you take the opportunity to discuss the pension increase?<eos> Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
Uh, I'll call you back.<eos> Detective Crowell, how accurate would you say that sequence is?<eos> I worked the case, and I'm a technical advisor on the show...<eos> that's exactly how Mr. Sweeney covered up the murder.<eos> There was a rug missing from Mr. Sweeney's house, Mr. Sweeney had a receipt for a gallon jug of lye in his work-shed.<eos> His lawyer convinced the judge the warrants didn't cover - "detached dwellings."<eos> - Detective, did the actual<eos> Colin Sweeney make a 911 call when he buried his wife?<eos> - Uh... - I'm sorry... when he discovered - his wife was missing?<eos> - Yes, he did.
- I have. He's quite a character, isn't he: Redmayne?<eos> He is.<eos> A bit provocative?<eos> I guess.<eos> My campaign manager is angry.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.
After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> One argument is better than another, right?<eos> Do you think this back-channel has overstayed its usefulness?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think campaigning is a lonely profession.<eos> And the only one who shares that loneliness... is you.<eos> We took down the robocall...<eos> the PAC did.
It's good, I think you're getting there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's good encouragement, thanks, Richard.<eos> That's OK.<eos> Think it would be fun for the kids to get inside, couldn't they?<eos> - Play around.<eos> - True.<eos> - Bouncy castle?<eos> - Bouncy arsehole, did you say?<eos> - No... I didn't, but by all means.
You've reached Dr. Vincent Keller...<eos> You've reached Detective Chandler...<eos> Damn it.<eos> Voicemail.<eos> You got to get to Cat.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna find Vincent.<eos> Someone's got to warn him.<eos> No.<eos> Don't do anything stupid, all right?
I only wish it had the same effect on Liam.<eos> I don't know why he's not dying, too.<eos> Did Julianna use the same serum on him?<eos> No, but it had some of the same properties.<eos> Which is why I assume he could do what he could do.<eos> And yourself?<eos> Are you... What, superhuman?<eos> I wish.<eos> How much do you know about Liam?<eos> Only as much as Julianna did and for the same reason:
No.<eos> Okay, wh...<eos> what if he can't find Liam?<eos> Okay? What if he can't stop him?<eos> Vincent knows what he's doing, believe me.<eos> Then why did you say you had a bad feeling about this, Detective?<eos> Okay? I-I'm dying.<eos> And without those meds that Julianna made to keep me alive, I-I don't have much time and I'll be damned if I die before Liam does.<eos> I understand what you're going through...<eos> No, you don't.
Because it's marked every day this week, every hour.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm a hypochondriac, remember?<eos> Look, we-we're on the clock.<eos> You-you'll need this for when Vincent and Liam come out of DHS.<eos> We can talk later.<eos> No.<eos> I want to talk about it now.<eos> But I don't!
Let's just get this over with.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Electromagnetic lock, lab's on the other side.<eos> The only problem is even I can't get into there.<eos> We're gonna have to work together.<eos> They're gonna be here any second.<eos> Either we both go primal on this door, or I go primal on them.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on. Push!<eos> We did it.
It's unrealistic to think about children.<eos> Not now.<eos> It's unrealistic.<eos> - Clark? - [ Sighs ]<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
You're right.<eos> I'll call Teddy and let him know.<eos> You know what?<eos> He might say "no."<eos> What if you just did it and let him see how wonderful you are?<eos> You're right.<eos> I am wonderful.<eos> Huzzah!<eos> Felix Unger wants a fist bump?<eos> I do.
Runter von der Bruecke.<eos> (Aurora): No!<eos> - Runter von der Bruecke.<eos> - Vorwaerts.<eos> Harry, blow it!<eos> Achtung!<eos> (Gunshots)<eos> Halt.<eos> Stehen bleiben.<eos> Do it!
- Runter von der Bruecke.<eos> - Vorwaerts.<eos> Harry, blow it!<eos> Achtung!<eos> (Gunshots)<eos> Halt.<eos> Stehen bleiben.<eos> Do it!<eos> Now!<eos> Do it!
Well, there's some part of them that's keeping them here.<eos> Some spirits hold on too tight.<eos> Dean, you haven't left the bunker in a week.<eos> And?<eos> You can't just live the rest of your life locked up in this room.<eos> Look, I know you're worried about the mark.<eos> Yes, Sam. I am.<eos> Do I wish the mark was gone?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Absolutely, I do.
And they'll want to know about Hallie.<eos> And they'll break me, too.<eos> Shames me, but it's true.<eos> There's a record where you hit an A over high C.<eos> Pure and perfect.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Creole Hot July.<eos> But I can't hit that note no more.<eos> Most people never touch greatness.<eos> You did.
Tell me what to do.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Danielle?<eos> Danielle!<eos> Danielle!<eos> What do I do?<eos> You're bleeding!<eos> You're bleeding too fast!<eos> I didn't... I didn't ask for any of this, you know.<eos> You lot never do.
My Polish is fluent; my german is terrible but I learn fast.<eos> Well, we can do that.<eos> is it because you want to be a field agent? Or is it because you don't like talking to the brits behind my back?<eos> - Sir...<eos> - It's all right.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And frankly, well, I'm glad it's you.<eos> So, I can approve your training, or... you can stay right here and we can continue to work together.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> I do.
Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Alfred, you've got to move!<eos> Alfred!<eos> Oou! Move it!<eos> Get out now!<eos> It's ok!<eos> We're going down!<eos> Move it!<eos> Jump or I'll bloody shoot your ass!<eos> Alfred, do this!
- On a trial basis?<eos> This was his trial.<eos> So that's why you've been giving him all that "homework."<eos> Come in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Show him what's in that.<eos> Know any other songs?<eos> One phrase to remember, and I screwed it up.<eos> I almost got Neil killed...<eos> But you didn't.
And he should have a suitcase.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> He should be here by now.<eos> Is that him?<eos> With the suitcase?<eos> It's the wrong wardrobe.<eos> What happened? (laboured breathing)<eos> Did he get the book?<eos> Did he?
She's working for the Germans.<eos> The boat's in view, we'll leave you here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Your friend, she left.<eos> - What do you mean, she left?<eos> - She's a German agent.<eos> - No. We screen everyone.<eos> - You screened her yourself?<eos> No.<eos> They did, in Marmonne.
You shouldn't be worried about what Theo and Cole wrote about you in some silly yearbook, anyway.<eos> Your friends' opinions are the only ones that should matter.<eos> That's actually a really good point, Lissa.<eos> - You're welcome. - [knock at door]<eos> Now get out.<eos> My 2:30's here.<eos> Okay, pay attention, Darlene.<eos> Here is my cheerleading uniform, a comprehensive tutorial on how I like to wear my hair, my favorite lip gloss, shoes, and... oops!<eos> I accidentally put in two types of eyeliner, but since you're my mom, I'm sure you'll know which one I prefer to use.<eos> Of course I do, honey.
Then there's Occam's razor.<eos> The simplest explanation is the best.<eos> I can't say I blame you.<eos> But I can't say I'll forgive you, either.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.
Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Because it so isn't.<eos> Yeah, I-I, I figured...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> On the upside, that means your mother's budget cuts won't affect the position.<eos> You know who my mother is?<eos> I do.
I don't want your hospitality.<eos> Hey, what are you mad at me for?<eos> I could've had your job.<eos> I turned it down.<eos> Yeah, well, that doesn't give it back to me.<eos> Well, you should've made her cut the Microloans program.<eos> Dude, I begged her.<eos> Burke was just looking for a reason to humiliate your boss.<eos> She handed it to him.<eos> Former boss And, yes, she did.
Aces.<eos> All right, let's gear up.<eos> That might be tricky.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Dean...<eos> - We made a promise.<eos> To do what?<eos> Charge out there, guns blazing?<eos> We don't even know how to kill them.<eos> She does.
Last season, on "The Flash"...<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> I wasn't the only one affected, was I?<eos> We've been searching for other meta-humans, like yourself.<eos> Don't be afraid, Cisco.<eos> You were affected, too.<eos> Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.<eos> Yes, I did.
I found myself outside her place, camera in hand, thinking,<eos> "Henri, what are you doing?<eos> "Do you have any idea how ridiculous this makes you?"<eos> When I realised that she loved him, I knew there was no chance for me.<eos> Is this how you behave when you're in love?<eos> Stupid?<eos> I know that now.<eos> I wanted to tell her.<eos> I should have told her.<eos> Why didn't you?
Thank you.<eos> It's always leaking, this pen!<eos> I'll just be a minute to clean...<eos> Only in the stew - everything else was clear.<eos> He was so gentle, so understanding.<eos> It belonged to Francis.<eos> We were following an authentic recipe I found.<eos> Just wanted a dad.<eos> You know who did it, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
You joined the Heritage Society to find friendship and you found the family you'd never had.<eos> And the child you'd never had.<eos> You killed Francis because you were about to lose the one person that mattered the most to you.<eos> You were about to lose Ryan.<eos> It's nonsense.<eos> You saw how unhappy he was on Saint Marie.<eos> Miles from home.<eos> No friends.<eos> His father not giving him any time or attention.<eos> But you did, didn't you?
And since Thetas tend to be over-achievers, the networking is pretty insane.<eos> Wow.<eos> I thought it was just a bunch of dumb parties.<eos> First of all, they aren't dumb, they're awesome.<eos> And, like anything, you can find the clichés if you're looking for them.<eos> You're right.<eos> And hopefully, it's like finding your tribe.<eos> When you know, you know.<eos> So, you want to meet a few people?<eos> Yeah, I do.
There's actually one thing I might have neglected to tell you, but we're gonna need the big bottle for that one.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've waited a really long time to tell you this, and, god, it's been killing me, but I swear the only reason I didn't tell you was because you seemed so happy with Cooper and... okay.<eos> The night that Josh broke off his wedding, he climbed up the fire escape to tell you he had feelings for you, but then he saw you kissing Cooper, and he was devastated, so he left.<eos> And then when I found out, he swore me to secrecy.<eos> Oh god, I should've told you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> Oh my god, you didn't hear a word I said.<eos> No, but I did.
Said the latest he can leave camp tonight is midnight.<eos> There's a piece of correspondence I have delayed sending for several weeks.<eos> It's an execution order.<eos> Execution?<eos> For who?<eos> A royal officer held by our forces.<eos> The crime he's committed most certainly merits death.<eos> Our Connecticut 5th has been awaiting my instructions for a month.<eos> If they do not hear word by tomorrow, they'll assume they have my approval to proceed with the execution.<eos> Well, do they or don't they?
Mr. Woodhull just confessed he's a spy.<eos> (menarguing) Shut up!<eos> Shut up, you sordid bastards.<eos> He said that one man in the city could do as much damage as 1,000 in the field.<eos> - Do not listen to him, sir.<eos> He's lying. - Hold your tongue.<eos> ( sighs ) Do you have proof?<eos> A witness?<eos> No, but you said I would go free if I got a confession.<eos> Ah, yes, I did.
But you don't have to.<eos> I'm going to leave this here.<eos> You can try to end yourself.<eos> Or maybe you'll make things interesting and run for the trees.<eos> You never know when you'll find the door unlocked.<eos> No. ( muttering )<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No!<eos> ( whimpering ) Maybe I did do it.<eos> Did I do it?

- Your son, Finnian.<eos> Finn, we always called him.<eos> Finn.<eos> There are some things that you need to understand about Justin about the way that things were.<eos> You see, his word was not just the law.<eos> It was the word of God himself.<eos> Justin was our oracle.<eos> He was our burning bush.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - You don't.
Who would sell a gun to a 15-year-old kid?<eos> A Deep Web arms dealer who doesn't care who he sells to.<eos> Spencer spent his weekly allowance on music and movies and video games.<eos> I'm telling you-- he didn't buy a gun.<eos> My son is dead and you are making him out to be the criminal.<eos> Look, I know this is difficult, but I have to ask these questions so we can find the person who is responsible.<eos> Did you ever go on to your son's social media accounts?<eos> Did you ever check his history on his computer?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> We did it all the time.
You really want to thank me?<eos> Don't put me<eos> I know.<eos> in this position...<eos> Position again.<eos> Heather Drake on one for you.<eos> Mrs. Drake, this is Detective Reagan.<eos> Did they explain to you what's going on down here with your husband?<eos> Ex-husband.<eos> And yes, they did.
Everything is fine.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm overwhelmed with gratitude.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Now she has enough money to afford a proper burial for her husband.<eos> Because of these two thoughtful souls.<eos> Is that true?<eos> The cops raised the money?<eos> Yes, they did.
You have a husband who no longer trusts you.<eos> I think if you ask him for an annulment, he will grant you one.<eos> I have a dying wife who wants me to find a mother for our children.<eos> Are you sure you want a mother for your children who has no shame?<eos> Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood<eos> - is something that doesn't interest you...<eos> - No. It does, actually.
Hey, for old times' sake, want to buy a cupcake?<eos> A dozen?<eos> The shop?<eos> So I came because I may know of a way for Max to make some extra money.<eos> Whatever it is, she'll do it.<eos> That was my yearbook quote.<eos> I just got hired at a new restaurant that's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan, and they are looking for another day pastry chef.<eos> I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.<eos> I don't know if I have the skills.<eos> Oh, girl, you don't.
Brooklyn.<eos> Brooklyn's almost over.<eos> Also, cupcakes.<eos> Cool.<eos> I will tell them.<eos> Wish I knew that before they all got their belly buttons pierced trying to stay cool.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> A sense of humor.<eos> Customers love that.<eos> I don't, but they do.
Well, I guess I can put these away then.<eos> That was your plan?<eos> To expose your breasts and seduce your way into this job?<eos> You say that like it's a bad thing.<eos> Okay. Well, bye.<eos> Sit, sit.<eos> If you really can bake, this position might be perfect for you.<eos> Also, you have that edgy, "I don't give a crap" attitude.<eos> Customers love that.<eos> I don't, but they do.
And according to that very small man, you're also a terrible waitress.<eos> But I had no idea you two were together.<eos> I would have thought a powerful...<eos> Stop.<eos> Now.<eos> Joe, look, we really need these jobs.<eos> We made a bad decision with our bakery business, and we have a big bank loan that we can't pay.<eos> Honesty.<eos> Good. People respond to honesty.<eos> I don't, but they do.
I don't blame Dr. B if she fires me.<eos> No, it's red nail polish.<eos> That little piece of bone you gave me was most likely a human nail, judging from the keratin content.<eos> I'm running the DNA right now.<eos> Well, that makes sense, based on the nail polish we just found in the sample.<eos> Excellent.<eos> That looks very expensive.<eos> Did I buy it?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, you did.
Yes!<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And I am very grateful.<eos> I'm sure the prosecutor will be, as well.<eos> Lori, there were only three people at the miniature golf the night that Troy Carter was murdered.<eos> It was your husband, Troy and you.<eos> You can't make me testify against my husband.<eos> There's some law about that, isn't there?<eos> Look, your husband didn't kill Troy Carter.<eos> You did.
Doesn't look like they cleaned it.<eos> Uh... no.<eos> Andie, I have a confession to make.<eos> Um, I was winding your clock this morning, and... I broke it.<eos> Oh, Wendell, no...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I really am.<eos> But-but it's okay.<eos> I fixed it.<eos> Um, well, Hodgins and I did.
Get a coffee or anything?<eos> Oh, that is so sweet, but I probably should just jump right into my investigation.<eos> I love the focus, but, FYI, there's nothing to investigate.<eos> Detective Diamond, I presume?<eos> You know, you would be the best person for me to just kick off my interviews with.<eos> Sure, ready?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> Actually, something did happen.<eos> No, it didn't.
Wait, I thought we were going in to get the bad guy?<eos> Nope, bad guy's coming to us.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Inside the consulate you're on Brazilian soil.<eos> Out here, we can legally arrest you for murder.<eos> You crazy...<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Not bad for your first New York field trip.<eos> Do it.
This has provided the unsub with a victim pool who have dropped their guard.<eos> His first victims were single, but his last two were married.<eos> This escalation indicates that he may be married himself and probably has a family.<eos> This unsub's M.O. takes patience and caution and is firmly rooted in a need-based desire, which means he won't be stopping anytime soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Meg, you deserve whatever reaction, but hurting yourself, it's not ok.<eos> But grounding me for a month on top of taking my phone away is ok?<eos> Since when did this house turn into some sort of a gulag?<eos> Ahem. I know that this is a huge adjustment.<eos> Do you?

Hey, sis.<eos> Voight's just frustrated because we're all taking this a bit personally now.<eos> Antonio, you looked into that man's eyes, right?<eos> He's not human.<eos> He's not even an animal.<eos> He's darkness.<eos> I know it.<eos> You need to arrest him, you make something up, get him, throw him in the pit, and never look back.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Voight does.
- [cat meows] - Yes.<eos> So I take it by the cat, you're single?<eos> Big time.<eos> So, do you and Dickens live alone?<eos> Oh no, she's trying to flirt.<eos> I travel a lot for work.<eos> I'm a venture capitalist.<eos> So you know how it is.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I absolutely do.
Nobody's gonna say.<eos> - I really know it was him.<eos> - All right.<eos> Now it's finally time for me and Rusty me to finally go toe-to-toe<eos> Do you want me to do anything to help?<eos> Richie.<eos> Just ask.<eos> - You know ***?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Of course I do.
And I'll call you back, probably.<eos> When did you realize she was gone?<eos> Half an hour ago.<eos> I went to check if she was sleeping.<eos> She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone.<eos> Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
I gotta pee, anyway.<eos> So... how's it going?<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Yeah, you did.
What's wrong?<eos> He got out.<eos> I locked it, Ma.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Do you know how stupid you are?<eos> Do you?
Previously on The Returned...<eos> He got out!<eos> Do you know how stupid you are?<eos> Do you?
There's no way the girl gets to come when rats fuck.<eos> First of all, he's not gonna hold out for her.<eos> He's not that kinda dude, you can tell. He didn't give a shit. He's gonna fuck her and leave, he doesn't even know her name.<eos> And even if he did, she's on a subway platform in front of people.<eos> She's not gonna be able to get to that place, that inside place, that girl rats need to find their orgasm.<eos> 'Cause I know what girl rats need. I know how to make a girl rat come.<eos> I do, you just pick 'em up and hold 'em upside down and just...<eos> Just to be clear, what I was doing there... I just want to make sure you know. I spit in her mouth while I played with her little asshole.<eos> Don't judge her, that's what she likes.<eos> I did it for her.
I'm so sorry things got messy.<eos> What a foolish fellow.<eos> I will make sure that there's no follow-up from your colleagues.<eos> Don't worry about a thing.<eos> You knew.<eos> You knew Ogden would go off.<eos> What a devious mind you have.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> We have a deal. We do.<eos> We do.
And in my eyes, so is my mama.<eos> So if Lyman wants to reconcile, then...<eos> Maybe I want that, too.<eos> Besides, I...<eos> Kind of already said yes.<eos> Without asking me?<eos> Lou, see, all I have tried to do is protect you.<eos> I mean, do you even know what it means to be in a...<eos> In a marriage, in a partnership?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's time you know the truth...<eos> I am a klutz.<eos> Tripped on my stiletto, went right into the makeup table.<eos> Teddy used to say it made me endearing.<eos> Really, all it does is make me bruise.<eos> Do you need some ice?<eos> Maybe some aspirin?<eos> There might be some in my purse.<eos> - Find anything?<eos> - Uh, sure did.
And the bastard was intent on leaving Victoria everything.<eos> I starved him until he had no choice but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will.<eos> So why come after me?<eos> Aww, honey.<eos> Conrad always wanted me to live like a Grayson, and that's not just about the money.<eos> It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Wait, is that it, right there?<eos> In your apron pocket?<eos> Mm-hmm. So it's in there.<eos> Yeah, come and get it.<eos> Well, it's all dirty now, 'cause it's in your apron with a dirty dishrag.<eos> So dirty.<eos> Hurry up, it's getting all mushy.<eos> Well, I don't really want to now, it has a dishrag on it.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> I really don't.
I'll be all right.<eos> (voice breaking): Thanks for asking. You're welcome.<eos> That was so intense.<eos> I thought they were going to last forever and ever.<eos> But instead they just imploded right before our eyes.<eos> So, Tina's single again?<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> I-I don't care.<eos> Jimmy Jr. likes Tina!<eos> No, I don't.
No. Striptease.<eos> Oh. Yeah.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Yeah.<eos> That could be fun. I'd like that.<eos> I'd like that, too. See you strut your stuff.<eos> Wait, me? Yeah.<eos> Magic Mike me, baby.<eos> (chuckles) Lin, you don't want that.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Grace under pressure.<eos> And who's the boss?<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> I believe you are, Jerome.<eos> I believe you are.<eos> Arigato, sensei.<eos> Four lunatics and Barbara?<eos> Brother, you got no luck.<eos> I told you civilian life was better, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Gin and tonic, please, uh, governor.<eos> Ice and a slice.<eos> Nice place.<eos> It is.<eos> Been here before, then, have you?<eos> It's my regular spot.<eos> Oh, right, you're a local.<eos> Nice.<eos> Don't I know you?<eos> Do you?
I've learned that the hard way, too.<eos> And did you even get a lead while you were out avenging Luke?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - No, sir?<eos> Well, you got one now.<eos> Bodega owner called this in.<eos> His security camera caught it.<eos> She's our firefly.<eos> We don't know who the other one is.<eos> I do.
After all, I do.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> I can make a body disappear.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is Ms. Kringle's body?<eos> Open the envelope.<eos> "I hid her body while you were catching some Zs,<eos> "you'll need a helping hand, so look for her initials down at the GCPD."<eos> You went to my work last night?<eos> Well, technically, you did.
I am.<eos> I've just decided... I'm gonna start with you.<eos> Dangerous words... when addressing the man who now controls this city.<eos> Desperate times.<eos> They are, indeed.<eos> I want to know why you did this.<eos> When Dr. Thompkins walked in the room, how did it feel?<eos> I was terrified.<eos> She could have discovered the body.<eos> But she didn't.
I promise.<eos> But my uncle didn't tell me anything.<eos> But you left me a message.<eos> I was supposed to keep you busy till this evening.<eos> He's sure he's going to be freed.<eos> Then he'll convince you to sell your company.<eos> I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't!
Jim... please don't act all surprised and aggrieved.<eos> You knew, from the start, that this was a trap.<eos> But you thought, "Hey, let the bad guys take their best shot.<eos> I'm Jim Gordon.<eos> I'll find a way to win.<eos> Or die."<eos> It's option B, baby.<eos> Your fondest wish come true.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Sure you do.
Everyone has an act.<eos> Did he tell you how he got reinstated at the GCPD?<eos> He killed a man for Penguin.<eos> Very good, Jim.<eos> You did tell her.<eos> We don't have secrets between us.<eos> He's done a lot of things that he's not proud of. Everyone has.<eos> But you love him anyway, is that right?<eos> Despite all his faults.<eos> Yes, I do.
Anything.<eos> Top ten lists... best vacations.<eos> What's your favorite animal?<eos> Owls.<eos> Owls.<eos> Owls, okay.<eos> Owls are cool.<eos> Did you ever swim with a dolphin?<eos> No.<eos> I did, once.
- A hindrance, perhaps.<eos> - That's very true.<eos> We need Jim Gordon.<eos> He's perfect for this kind of thing.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Yeah, where is Jim Gordon?<eos> It's a long story, but nobody knows.<eos> Something funny, Ed?<eos> Do you know where Gordon is?<eos> Do you?
He's cool, sexy, and owns a gourmet butcher shop.<eos> Oh, wow! Sofia hasn't had a good piece of meat in a while.<eos> So, uh, we're going on our second date tonight, so I just came to pick up some mo' wine.<eos> - Oh! And whatever might be in your oven.<eos> Whoo! Girl, I am so glad I moved next door.<eos> Sofia... don't even say it.<eos> I'm not using that app.<eos> Men of the world, you've had your chance.<eos> My ass might not quit, but I do.<eos> Yeah, well, luckily I don't.
Caroline just announced her engagement.<eos> What?<eos> But she and Josh broke up, like, two months ago.<eos> I thought she'd be too busy making coats out of dalmatian puppies to get married again.<eos> Wait, does Josh know?<eos> Why do you think I'm hiding his laptop his smartphone... And whatever this vibrating thing is?<eos> Yolanda just told me Caroline's engaged?<eos> Damn it!<eos> Listen, Josh, just because Caroline is engaged doesn't mean you need to go start feeling - all bad about yourself.<eos> - I don't.
Don't you want to see?<eos> Are the guys shirtless?<eos> No.<eos> Then no.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Ooh, Ruben.<eos> Let's see, college graduate, works in marketing, five foot...<eos> Elliot, it looks like we have a match.<eos> Did you know, statistically, cellphones are dirtier than toilet seats?<eos> I did not.
Plus, I did a background check while he was sleeping.<eos> No priors.<eos> No urine sample?<eos> You're slipping.<eos> Well, anyway, I'm gonna shower because he says he has to leave for work, where he wears a suit.<eos> I'm finally dating a guy who wears a suit!<eos> ♪ Go Gabi, go Gabi. ♪<eos> Hey, Ruben.<eos> Hey! I thought you left for work.<eos> I did not.
I know what you're doing.<eos> You put almonds in my sundae, knowing that I do not like them, because even though the sundae's not perfect, I'll love it anyway.<eos> Oh, did you pick up on that?<eos> And it's not gonna work because a sundae isn't a person, unless you're planning to set me up with a person who dresses like a sundae.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Who's the biggest disaster you've ever met in your whole life?<eos> You.<eos> Okay, first off, you answered that too fast.<eos> And second, despite what happened today, do you love me?<eos> (Sighs) Of course I do.
- Charles, write that down.<eos> - Already did.<eos> Sarge, what's the big deal?<eos> We stopped two kilos of heroin from hitting the streets.<eos> Who cares about one broken window?<eos> I do!<eos> I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.<eos> But...<eos> Terry loves paperwork?<eos> - No, Jake, I do not. - Oh.
What did you do to my cupcake?<eos> This is yours?<eos> Why on Earth is your cupcake on my chair?<eos> Because it's very special to me, so I can put it wherever I want.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> Now you have to buy me a new cupcake.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> You expect me to avoid...<eos> oh, I see.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.<eos> Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.<eos> Can we ask you a question?<eos> - Mm-hm. - Why do you smell like fish?<eos> Is it hygiene?<eos> No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.<eos> They didn't.
- Ooh! Come here. Come here, come here, come here.<eos> You got to see this.<eos> I'm about to give Captain Holt his gift.<eos> - Oh, did he lift his "no gift" policy?<eos> - No, he didn't.
All right, where are you holding the hostages?<eos> - Oh, bet you'd like to know, eh?<eos> - Canadian?<eos> No! You're so clearly supposed to be German.<eos> Are any of you German? both:<eos> Mm-mm. - Russian? both:<eos> Mm-mm. - North Korean?<eos> - Mm-mm. - Greek?<eos> - [mumbles] - I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.<eos> - No one does.
I've told the Ministry time and again to put a ladder there.<eos> We could have an accident any day.<eos> Carrasco?<eos> We have to go... here.<eos> Bear's Tavern.<eos> It's not far.<eos> Half an hour on horseback.<eos> You can't expect the lady to ride a horse.<eos> - I know how to ride.<eos> - Well, sorry, I don't.
I'm not entirely sure.<eos> Um... can I, er...<eos> Good, um... and... and I need you to be entirely honest with me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you think Camille would be happier staying here or accepting the job in Paris?<eos> Camille is ambitious, adventurous.<eos> She always has been.<eos> Of course she wants to go to Paris and work undercover, and although I'd rather she stayed here on the island, safe from harm, I know it would be best for her to leave.<eos> And you must know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we're not like you, Julianna.<eos> We don't just kill people.<eos> Who are you kidding?<eos> Liam sent you.<eos> Who is Liam?<eos> VINCENT: Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Catherine, I'm more sorry than you could ever imagine, you know?<eos> I don't even know how...<eos> how you can forgive me on this one.<eos> For what, for loving me?<eos> For wanting to marry me?<eos> What big a mess, huh?<eos> Yeah. What a mess.<eos> Guess it's gonna be a while before we can try again.<eos> That's if you do want to try again.<eos> Oh, of course I do.
I screwed up everything.<eos> Alex, it's not your fault.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Alex, you are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> Was there anything...<eos> Did you at least see him?<eos> Anything about him?<eos> (man on phone) Mr. Kristoff, did you receive our package?<eos> I did.
Freeze!<eos> Gregor minsk, you're under arrest.<eos> Oh! I can't let jenny see me like this.<eos> I ripped my cummerbund.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have an extra one. You can borrow it.<eos> From my high school jazz band uniform.<eos> I'm only gonna tell you this Because you were a great partner today.<eos> Uh-huh? I played french horn.<eos> I still do.
He needs to be shut down, shut up, rendered mute,<eos> I don't know... he just needs to stop talking.<eos> Take care of it.<eos> Well, I'm not sure what I can do.<eos> He doesn't exactly think I'm on his side.<eos> He knows Cyrus got to me.<eos> I don't have any way to convince him that...<eos> I slept with that filthy dirtbag to save your life, to save your child's life after that Huck animal grated your back like a piece of cheese.<eos> Remember that?<eos> I do.
I mean...<eos> I'm asking...<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> I wasn't raped.<eos> Guess what I learned.<eos> There are worse things than rape.<eos> Olivia, don't you dare.<eos> You went to war.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You did.
- Where we going?<eos> - To the gulanite mines.<eos> There's no point.<eos> Why not?<eos> The mines collapsed the night you disappeared.<eos> The ground hardened into I don't know what, but our drills can't cut through.<eos> The gulanite's down there, but we can't access it.<eos> And yet, somehow, Irisa and I found our way out and made it to the surface. So there's gotta be a tunnel or something.<eos> You don't know how you made it to the surface?<eos> No, but the purple-skins do.
- Purple-skins?<eos> - I'll tell you on the way.<eos> Hey! Berlin!<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - She killed Tommy!<eos> A machine killed Tommy!<eos> You lay a hand on her again, and I don't care who you are, I will put you in the ground.<eos> That hardware always been there? No, it's new.<eos> Thought you said no one was home at the mines.<eos> I did.
What I got to hide?<eos> What, they gonna give me more time?<eos> I got life plus 30 already.<eos> That mean after I die, I gotta be back up in here anyway.<eos> All right, then, do you know anything about who might be involved?<eos> Nah, man, me and my people, we don't mess with socks.<eos> It's melodramatic.<eos> You know about that?<eos> I know about a lot.<eos> Just not who did it.
They, for the past year, have matching bank activity, and a lot of it.<eos> Like one guy would withdraw cash and the other one would deposit the exact same amount, sometimes as low as 200 bucks, a couple times as high as 2,000.<eos> They even wrote checks to each other.<eos> If I was a betting woman, I would bet that these two have been paying off bets.<eos> That's nice work, baby girl.<eos> Good job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, take care of yourself.<eos> Come on, you know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just let her go, man.<eos> Oh, I like her.<eos> Handle it.<eos> In here!<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> Over there.<eos> Gather 'round!<eos> I want everyone to see this.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Do it.
Where are they taking your things?<eos> Where do you think?<eos> The ship leaves tonight.<eos> What ship?<eos> You remember when you made this for me, that time we went to the beach?<eos> I couldn't have been more than six or seven years old.<eos> I remember.<eos> It's funny to think that I kept it all these years.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> You can turn around now.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship.<eos> Do we?<eos> If it gets any worse we're gonna have to shut it down.<eos> A damaged relationship?<eos> Relay switch.<eos> I said relay switch.<eos> No, you didn't.
What the hell's going on down there?<eos> We've got men down.<eos> We're in pursuit.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You need to know I understand.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> What?<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> Revenge.<eos> Revenge, for what they did to two.
And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
Absolutely not.<eos> If you're going to come up with a plan of action, I suggest you do it quickly.<eos> Hello, Rebecca.<eos> Who the hell are you and what did you do to me?<eos> And why do you keep calling me Rebecca?<eos> Because that's your name.<eos> And you are?<eos> It's Alex.<eos> You-you really don't remember me?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay, I've got an explosion...<eos> Multiple explosions!<eos> I knew you'd be back!<eos> Worried we wouldn't make it in time?<eos> Nah.<eos> I deleted the nav command you guys entered, just in case.<eos> And what if we hadn't come back?<eos> Then I would've programmed a new one.<eos> I didn't know you knew how to program.<eos> Neither did I.
Until then, I'd advise everyone to not consume anything that isn't sealed.<eos> A few minutes later, we all would've joined him.<eos> Not all of us.<eos> One of us didn't take any water.<eos> One of us wasn't thirsty.<eos> Isn't that convenient.<eos> Oh, come on. If I wanted to drug you, I would've taken a cup like the rest of you so you wouldn't suspect me.<eos> Unless, of course, you thought that we wouldn't be awake to suspect you.<eos> I'm smart enough not to take that chance.<eos> And yet, you did.
Come on, who's stupid enough to hide that thing in their room?<eos> I wanna search his quarters too!<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll search everyone's quarters.<eos> I don't even know what half of this stuff is.<eos> Neither do I until I fix it.<eos> Are we done here? Yeah.<eos> That's a little something I picked up at the last space station... from a little something I picked up at the last space station.<eos> Uh-huh. Moving on.<eos> We done here?
So...<eos> I guess we're just gonna have to drive to Susan's house and deliver some Chanel-o-ween presents in person.<eos> ♪ It's all about you... ♪ Hi, Susan.<eos> For you.<eos> ♪ You... ♪ Thank you so... much!<eos> You're the most important person in the world.<eos> I would do anything... for you, Chanel.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> So you didn't see anyone in a Red Devil costume entering or leaving the house?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
Until one day, some kids looked up and saw her standing in the window, dressed in black, staring out at that street, just a-moanin'.<eos> Now, they tried to tell folks about the hag in the old house on Shady Lane, but nobody believed 'em. Mm-mm.<eos> They said, "These dumb ol' kids are smoking crack.<eos> Ain't no hag in the house on Shady Lane."<eos> But then... someone else saw her.<eos> The woman just thought the hag was rooting around for food...<eos> But then them kids... heard that caterwauling again.<eos> So they snuck into this house and went upstairs to the bedroom.<eos> And do you know what they saw?<eos> Do you?
- He kept me in a pit.<eos> - Did he dig the pit himself?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Just wondering where you find a house with a pit.<eos> The market for them would be pretty limited.<eos> Did you escape, or did you kill him?<eos> Because if you did, you need to tell us all of the details, including what his eyes looked like when he took his last breath.<eos> They say in that moment, the soul tells all of its secrets.<eos> No, they don¡¯t, no one says that.<eos> - Yeah, they do.

I'm so sorry, Chanel.<eos> I promise to never betray your trust again.<eos> You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> ! How?<eos> !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work!<eos> Yes, they do.

How?<eos> !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work!<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No! No one did!
You work fast.<eos> I paint them all.<eos> We are murderers hell-bent on revenge.<eos> Tell me what happened to the baby.<eos> Come to my office, alone.<eos> Well? "Well" what?<eos> You scheduled this meeting; that means you talk first and I do my best to try to pretend to listen.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You told me if I helped you get out of that asylum, you'd tell me what happened to the baby in the bathtub.<eos> Did I?
And that's all you need?<eos> That's all I need.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Grace...<eos> I love you.<eos> I-I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I want to.<eos> You know that.<eos> I really do.
Also, it helps to be completely frickin' insane.<eos> Because for a plan like this to work, you have to be willing to totally commit.<eos> I mean, desperate times call for desperate measures.<eos> This was the price I had to pay if I wanted to get away with murder and pin it all on someone else.<eos> The Red Devil!<eos> Because some people don't deserve to just get murdered.<eos> They need to be truly punished.<eos> I didn't do it, I swear!<eos> Oh, please, we all know the guy from Nickelback did not, in fact, swipe right on your profile.<eos> Uh, yes, he did, okay?
But when he writes back, his advice is always,<eos> "Maybe you should murder some of your sorority sisters."<eos> Why don't you go ahead and read us one?<eos> Mm-hmm. "Precious daughter, "I'm sorry I don't know anything about yeast infections,<eos> "but I did see an incredible story on the news about, uh, a pizza guy who had a bomb strapped to him." What?<eos> "I'm totes sad that I can't order "a pizza to the penitentiary and strap a bomb to the pizza guy, but that doesn't mean y-you can't."<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That's real suspicious.<eos> I-I'm telling you, I didn't kill anybody.<eos> Well, maybe you didn't, but your split personality did.
I can't wait.<eos> Touch.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Getting ready.<eos> You're wearing shoes made out of plastic bags.<eos> How good are you ever gonna look?<eos> So what club are you going to?<eos> I hear there's a burnt out caravan that's very now.<eos> I think we should have an open relationship.<eos> We do.
Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...<eos> Um...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.<eos> (TRESSA SNIFFLES)<eos> (EXHALES DEEPLY)<eos> (KISSING SOUNDS)<eos> You know... (SIGHS)<eos> I don't know what to say anymore.<eos> I don't.
Play it.<eos> That's my song.<eos> That's our song.<eos> (MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)<eos> KENDALL:<eos> But most of my friends think that I shouldn't date her.<eos> But all I ever see is a girl that wanted to make something for herself.<eos> I mean, when it really comes down to it, Tressa's a boss.<eos> She's a hustler, she's a grinder, and she's damn good at it.<eos> She did...
He could come back at any minute.<eos> Text you when we're on our way.<eos> Conner?<eos> Did you pack your toothbrush?<eos> Conner!<eos> [Cartoon music on TV]<eos> Conner?<eos> Didn't you hear me calling you?<eos> And how many times have I told you not to go to the cabinet and get candy?<eos> I didn't, Mom.
Johnny.<eos> He retired a few years back, but he still lives in town.<eos> You think he might know what happened to the kid?<eos> It'd be good to talk to him.<eos> [Door slams]<eos> You didn't do it right.<eos> I shouldn't have to do this.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't.
Your duty's over, Ben.<eos> Ben?<eos> Ben?<eos> Hubba hubba!<eos> Who says, "Hubba hubba?" Sorry, I don't have a great track record with the ladies.<eos> Which makes you and your apparent interest in me doubly unbelievable.<eos> Oh, this is a trap, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stop talking out loud, Grahame.<eos> Always doing that.
Tragic.<eos> Still... peckish?<eos> I thought you weren't a cannibal no more.<eos> We talked about it, remember?<eos> Can't you see I'm trying?<eos> You've got a heart of stone.<eos> This is all flesh and blood.<eos> OK, wrong choice of words.<eos> And I thought you understood me.<eos> I do!
Oh, please!<eos> She's a total babe!<eos> D'you really think she'd fall head-over-heels in love with you at first sight? No!<eos> Look, you feel like Ash is your rival, like she's threatening you.<eos> But just cos you feel something, doesn't make it true.<eos> Listen to you doing your impression of an adult! God!<eos> You're pleased!<eos> You love that she likes you.<eos> She doesn't like me like me.<eos> Does she?
Rings a bell, doesn't it?<eos> Rings a bell.<eos> Don't play with me, please.<eos> The Book of the Gates is the origin of this Ministry.<eos> And how do you know so much about this Ministry?<eos> I have very good contacts, in my country and in yours.<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Abraham Levi handed over the book to the Queen Isabella of Castile. In exchange for protection.<eos> I think you know the story.<eos> Yes, I do.
OK.<eos> Do you have a wife or anything?<eos> No.<eos> OK, well, I'll write down my number.<eos> Oh, you know what, that's my work visa, so if you... ~ Doesn't matter.<eos> ~ (OK.)<eos> Great.<eos> I noticed that you took some things from the bathroom, and that's fine, but could you leave the toothpaste?<eos> Erm, no, I didn't take any tooth...<eos> Oh, shit, I did, yeah.
~ More than one exception.<eos> This is a delicious meal.<eos> Best meal I've had in some time.<eos> ~ Remember that meal we had Tuesday?<eos> ~ I do. ~ This is better, this meal.<eos> ~ I'm going for a cigarette.<eos> ~ Really? Do you really have to?<eos> Yup.<eos> Rob, do you smoke?<eos> No, I don't.
And we didn't speak for months.<eos> Ten days ago, I get a call from her editor saying she's down in Mexico, wants to blow the lid off this big drug cartel.<eos> You want us to find her?<eos> In drug cartel territory?<eos> There are ongoing, very sensitive border sovereignty talks between the U.S. and Mexico.<eos> The last thing the State wants is us sending in a paramilitary group to rescue a citizen.<eos> Well, they must know who you are.<eos> They know who Zoe is.<eos> There must be a substantial ransom; pay it.<eos> - I did.
- Ship?<eos> San Esteban.<eos> She's a galleon too.<eos> And one of the first to sail, tomorrow at dawn.<eos> Of course, why would it sail later.<eos> Let's not get anxious.<eos> We need to find out the San Esteban's fate.<eos> Maybe she also came back to Spain mostly unharmed.<eos> Okay, I know it's a strange question, being in 1588, but does your grace have a PC at your disposal?<eos> By God I do.
Andrea Payton mysteriously disappeared from Federson township.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Uh, I didn't...<eos> Recognize me out of costume?<eos> The real me?<eos> I like to ride around after the show, just to chill out, you know?<eos> I saw you wandering around aimlessly, and I thought one of our zombies had escaped.<eos> Sorry to disappoint.<eos> You didn't.
I don't owe you loyalty!<eos> What's wrong, brother?<eos> Isn't she cooperating?<eos> Brother?<eos> No, she's not cooperating.<eos> She's being a stubborn little fool.<eos> Calm down, Hunter.<eos> He didn't mean that.<eos> He cares about you, Beth.<eos> We all do.
~ I'd say THAT is a much better idea.<eos> Excellent.<eos> We're not allowed to drink on duty, are we?<eos> It's so we can blend in.<eos> I'm very dedicated to my undercover work, you know.<eos> I mean, very, very dedicated.<eos> Raise them high, drain them dry.<eos> Only I'm not really a big drinker, sir.<eos> You... you know how it is. Er...<eos> No, I don't.
Turns out she fell pregnant and had his kid.<eos> ~ So, Jim abandoned her?<eos> ~ Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> Jim never even knew he was the father, not until the day before yesterday.<eos> ~ I... I don't understand.<eos> ~ Look.<eos> When Marie found out she was pregnant, she called Jim.<eos> But she could only get hold of Stevie and he promised to pass the message on.<eos> And what?<eos> He didn't?
I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.<eos> I told you, the beer company are delighted with that little clip.<eos> But there was a bigger problem than the bad press that clip might have brought you, wasn't there?<eos> Stevie, the new Stevie... .. didn't want to sell out.<eos> He was still a man of the people... .. and because of that, he refused to sign that contract.<eos> But I told you, he did.<eos> He did sign the contract.<eos> And you saw Stevie sign it?<eos> No.<eos> - Pete did.
Streaks of orange invading the yellow, very bad.<eos> - Oh. - You need an immediate aura massage.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Oh, you know what?<eos> I have never had one before.<eos> - Will it hurt?<eos> - No, you won't feel a thing.<eos> There's a reason for that.<eos> Yeah, wow. No, I feel it working.<eos> Um, did you do this a lot for Emma?
I need to make some changes.<eos> Like what?<eos> Getting back to being a doctor, for one thing.<eos> Treating people that need my help.<eos> Being accused of a crime you didn't commit is a pretty good wake up call.<eos> Seeing you again made me remember the man I used to be, before I became...<eos> A complete jackass?<eos> Sorry, I don't mean that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Minus the red hair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was very nice to meet you.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> So down there.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> These guys are nut jobs at best and dangerous at worst.<eos> Now, how did you know where to find them?<eos> I just did, all right?
So no beer?<eos> Why would I bring beer?<eos> Because you don't want me drinking liquor?<eos> I don't want you drinking anything!<eos> What, that's all for her?<eos> I'll find a sitter.<eos> Lana, relax.<eos> I won't drink while you're gone.<eos> I take this very seriously.<eos> Well, or at least woodhouse does.
No, no, you're crazy.<eos> I didn't have...<eos> Detective Bell, could I speak to you over here for a moment?<eos> Would you just...<eos> One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.<eos> Or I didn't when I started talking.<eos> I do now.
- This is...<eos> We don't need to be talking about this.<eos> If I do wake up but I'm dependent on vents or tubes, pull the plug then, too.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're not... you're not dying.<eos> You're not gonna wake up gorked.<eos> Shepherd knows<eos> - what she's doing.<eos> She does. - Okay. Sure.<eos> - She does!
Let 'er rip!<eos> What a cannon!<eos> Wow!<eos> - 58 miles per hour.<eos> - Wait. What? !<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What are you guys doing?<eos> When we were at the mall, we got this baseball that shows you how fast you throw it.<eos> You guys went to the mall together?<eos> Yes, we sure did.
And you thought I deserted my own baby?<eos> You did leave.<eos> And then what-- what's up with this note, huh?<eos> Look-- "I'm sorry to leave this way.<eos> I'm not proud of it, but I just can't do this."<eos> This diaper bag is just a recycled purse from my single days!<eos> I got a lot of these notes lying around for quick getaways.<eos> - You guys don't think that I can do this, do you?<eos> - No! - We always thought you could do it.<eos> - I certainly don't.
- _ - Hello?<eos> Hey, dad. Dad, take the phone away from your ear.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> Now I can't hear you.<eos> Put it in front of your face.<eos> Oh!<eos> How'd you get in my phone?<eos> Does this mean when we talked the other day<eos> - that you knew I was in the can?<eos> - I do now.
Oh, hang on, hang on-- getting a call from dad.<eos> Do the thing.<eos> Do the cute thing.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Claire?<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Mitchell?<eos> - What are you doing in my phone?<eos> - You called me, dad.<eos> No, I didn't.
I will advise you, though, strictly as your friend.<eos> I have no idea what Antoine is doing with England.<eos> But if the rumors are true, you should give him the money he's asking for.<eos> Like any other king, he can be bought.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Claude is probably just a link back to the royal family for Narcisse.<eos> A road back to power.<eos> And a very beautiful road at that.<eos> Oh, I thought you didn't care.<eos> I don't.
I've been baptized.<eos> I've been baptized.<eos> I'll heal it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why have I not been given the same power as Philip, eh?<eos> Can I bandage my hand now?<eos> I trust the condemned man ate a hearty breakfast.<eos> Did you rest well last night?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> We did.
I only just started work here in the palace, but I know Joanna from...<eos> From the market.<eos> We used to see each other at the market.<eos> Didn't we agree you need to tell me about any new friends?<eos> My wife has come under some bad influences recently.<eos> I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll keep her from harm.<eos> Your husband doesn't know about your faith?<eos> He does.
If he will forgive me, I will be complete in Jesus!<eos> Barnabas!<eos> Reuben!<eos> What's happened to you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I-I had to walk.<eos> What?<eos> He... he said everything that we thought we knew was wrong.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
I'm asking you.<eos> How would you show your devotion to me?<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> Aurelius!<eos> Yes, dear emperor?<eos> She doesn't like me.<eos> My wife and I devo...<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't.
I would never say...<eos> Aurelius, you were my Uncle's trusted adviser.<eos> Yes, and I would never say s...<eos> Did he talk about me, too?<eos> Did you laugh at me together?<eos> These are malicious rumors.<eos> Uh... Are you loyal?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> I do.
These are malicious rumors.<eos> Uh... Are you loyal?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> I do.<eos> As much as you loved my Uncle?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you swore eternal devotion to him.<eos> You offered up your life.<eos> I did.
So, this is where you're all hiding now.<eos> Hello, brothers.<eos> You're no brother of mine.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm no threat, I swear.<eos> Brother Simon...<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Do you really believe that he has turned to Christ?<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> I'm no threat, I swear.<eos> Brother Simon...<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Do you really believe that he has turned to Christ?<eos> I do.<eos> His faith burns very brightly.<eos> Maybe a little too brightly.<eos> I understand your fears.<eos> I do.
Will you never let this go? !<eos> Do none of you practice what you preach?<eos> It's not that easy!<eos> Isn't it? !<eos> You all bicker and prattle like children when inside each of you is the greatest gift!<eos> And you have to share that with mankind!<eos> You have to!<eos> And I have to, too!<eos> You went after my daughter!<eos> Yes, I did.
We can only plan for its arrival.<eos> I know.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> But that's all we can do.<eos> We must reinforce the Garrison.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.

This is politics, is it?<eos> There is the will of Rome, the fear it inspires.<eos> And there is us.<eos> We must make them love more than fear, or we will all die.<eos> Every word that Saul speaks is a stain upon your reputation.<eos> Did you not hear what I just said?<eos> Did you not just hear me?<eos> You are the high priest of the temple of Jerusalem.<eos> When will you act like it?<eos> I do.
I've heard from the schools of Shammai and Hillel.<eos> They will all stand with you.<eos> It's nearly time.<eos> Before you go, I...<eos> I need to talk to you about your wife.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes, governor.<eos> You have enough men?<eos> They understand their duties?<eos> They do.
I was making things right.<eos> You brought us back here.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
You brought us back here.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
Okay.<eos> We got the apartment!<eos> Shauna, there's something I wanna talk to you about.<eos> Isn't talk what we do after sex?<eos> Well, tonight, we're talking before.<eos> I know about Brett.<eos> Oh my God, how'd you find out?<eos> That doesn't matter, Josh.<eos> I swear I was gonna tell you.<eos> But, you didn't.
She's not the best at returning calls, but this is different.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I know something happened and I just...<eos> I really don't want to bother you, but, um...<eos> Have you spoken with her recently?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You knew Olivia was missing.<eos> Yes?<eos> You knew Olivia was missing, and you didn't tell me!<eos> - I didn't.
Olivia Pope is dead.<eos> I have some more executive orders to go over with you, Sir, if you have a moment.<eos> I'm sorry I lost it back there.<eos> Apologize to Director Lowry for me.<eos> I refuse to do that, Sir.<eos> You were in the right.<eos> Besides, if the director of the CIA can't take being yelled at, the future of our nation's intelligence is in severe jeopardy.<eos> 43 coffins are coming off the plane at Dover air base this afternoon.<eos> Did you know Mellie meets every plane?<eos> I did not, Sir, no.
It's a side effect of me becoming Adalind and sleeping with Nick.<eos> What side effects?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Juliette, talk to us.<eos> I'm... I'm losing myself.<eos> I need help.<eos> Juliette.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> You told them?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm Detective Neely.<eos> Do you have a few minutes to talk?<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> So, what is this all about?<eos> What can I do for you folks?<eos> Mr. Whitfield, is your wife, Eva, home?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No, I don't.
Can we talk about it out here?<eos> Oh. What did you think of Stacy?<eos> Oh, man, she was great.<eos> Mm-hmm. Until I started getting a stalker vibe from her.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, we were right in the middle of appetizers, and that's when she told me that the blue shorts I was wearing during the triathlon made my legs look sexy, which is true, but how did she even know I competed, never mind what color shorts I was wearing?<eos> And that's when she told me that she saw the photo on my profile.<eos> Oh, this is funny to you?<eos> You signed me up for match. Com behind my back?<eos> Well, technically, Jenny did.
Why?<eos> I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being the killer.<eos> It does.<eos> Oh, you believe this theory of Castle's?<eos> I believe that he's been right too many times not to consider it.<eos> Hey, I was just about to call you.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking about it, and with the benefit of hindsight, y-you're right.<eos> I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.<eos> Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he doesn't.
And I think I know who that is.<eos> CSU checked on that corporate apartment.<eos> They found Eva's fingerprints, but that's not all they found.<eos> I'm just putting Cole's affairs in order.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Do you need something?<eos> Ms. Haskins, you should know that Cole Whitfield's blood work came in, showing high levels of sedatives.<eos> So high, in fact, he wouldn't have been able to hang himself.<eos> We re-checked his phone records and noticed that you called his house on numerous occasions.<eos> Of course I did.
I'm Ollie!<eos> Forget it!<eos> Which one am I?<eos> I'm gonna lose.<eos> Oh!<eos> "Follow the braid, check the files, what you find will make you smile."<eos> Maybe someone who wears braids.<eos> Snoop dogg?<eos> Follow Snoop Dogg.<eos> I already do.
A D.U.I. with a child in the car...<eos> Is a felony.<eos> I know.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> We're gonna fight it.<eos> But I need to know...<eos> Were you drinking?<eos> I didn't have a drop.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
And now you can take me to my son.<eos> David: Jack's at home with Carl.<eos> Stevie: David?<eos> You posted my bail?<eos> 20 years ago, you tried to help get me out of prison.<eos> Thought it's time I returned the favor.<eos> You ready to go?<eos> One of my greatest regrets is not being capable of helping you when you were at your lowest because I was at mine.<eos> - I'm sorry I failed you.<eos> - You didn't.
And if I refuse?<eos> All of the bribes you accepted in the form of endorsements from LeMarchal publications will be exposed.<eos> And you'll lose everything, just like you threatened to take from Jack.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> Choose wisely.<eos> I'll be watching you.<eos> Why is it taking so long?<eos> It didn't work.<eos> No, we don't know that.<eos> And if it doesn't,
What are you even doing here?<eos> I'm attending your meeting with Chip...<eos> Chip Harding, ma'am.<eos> Okay, isn't Abby about to go into labor any second?<eos> - Literally any second.<eos> - So, go, go.<eos> I can handle Harding by myself.<eos> If I need more information, I'll get it from Laura back...<eos> Brilliant, and she really wanted to make an impression.<eos> Oh, she did.
You shouldn't have.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Then I'll just go in and convey the president's best wishes.<eos> I said she's fine, Russell.<eos> Tell that to the Chinese.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Hope you're right, Henry.<eos> I really do.
'Cause they thought I was dead, right?<eos> No, because they thought you died back in '94.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> Creatively, Johnny, you kind of did.<eos> The fact the band broke up the day the album came out made you Belgian cult heroes...<eos> Very devoted fans.<eos> So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later... Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
Girl.<eos> Gir-irl!<eos> Tell me everything that happened.<eos> Leave out no details.<eos> It was insane.<eos> I mean, like, so hot. Like the Caribbean or our shower that one time.<eos> What are you two celebrating?<eos> I know it isn't a job well done.<eos> We are celebrating the release Episode VII trailer online. Seriously?<eos> Max, we did everything.
- They wouldn't have done that.<eos> You were all so off your tits you don't know what happened.<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, if one of us drug addicts has nicked it, I'll get you another one.<eos> I don't fucking want another one!<eos> This one's got all my stuff on it.<eos> I need it for my interview.<eos> Oh, do you know what?<eos> Don't worry, you don't understand.<eos> - Of course I do.
So, how was it?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Just a total lack of respect.<eos> How many times do I have to say it?<eos> He never listens.<eos> D'you want a drink, sweetie?<eos> Disgusting.<eos> It's disgusting in here.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me how it went?<eos> - I just did.

You were having a good time.<eos> - You should have stopped me!<eos> - What?<eos> I'm responsible for you?<eos> Suddenly I'm the fun police?<eos> Nah... rules and regulations are your shit.<eos> I've not lived with someone before.<eos> I can't handle it, OK?<eos> I can't get battered every night.<eos> Then don't.
Just think, I could have my very own Sophie and Anna<eos> - and Sam and Tina...<eos> - Stop it.<eos> What a thing to teach a kid!<eos> How women rip each other's hearts out in the name of love.<eos> What a lesson!<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> - You want an apology.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I do!
I was ready to give up everything for Max when he got shot.<eos> I mean, school, my future.<eos> And now it seems like...<eos> Forgiving Crash is more important to him than I am.<eos> - (Muffled arguing continues) - That's not true.<eos> Well, Max is fine with it, so...<eos> Yeah, because he's Max.<eos> That's not how he really feels, though.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do, Tay.
Doesn't mean you have to break up.<eos> I don't really want to talk about this.<eos> ♪ Falling down ♪ Wait, don't go.<eos> ♪ So heavy ♪ - Tay? - (Door closes)<eos> ♪ It's hard laying down ♪ Do you think they heard?<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you sleep with her?<eos> We had two little babies.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Hey.<eos> Sorry, we were up late talking.<eos> Family meeting in the living room.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!<eos> , we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it.<eos> - They're getting divorced.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I can't go to the party tonight.<eos> I get it.<eos> The next few weeks are gonna be hard.<eos> But everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Well, my suit doesn't fit, and the Country Club won't let me in if I'm not wearing a suit.<eos> Is that why you can't go tonight?<eos> I told you three months ago.<eos> Yep, you did.
There we are.<eos> Where?<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean...<eos> I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Veg with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry you're going through all of this.<eos> You know, it's just that we're the kids, the one's who are supposed to be getting into trouble and causing problems.<eos> And yet, we're the ones doing all the adult stuff while our parents are out there being irresponsible and reckless.<eos> Yeah, I'm starting to think it might be nice if all I had to worry about was prom and whether or not I'm gonna look like a dork in my yearbook photo, rather than constantly feeling like I have to hold my family together.<eos> To... adulting.<eos> To adulting.<eos> So does this mean you figured out what to do with those files?<eos> Yeah, I did.
We are all tired.<eos> But we need to be better than this.<eos> Hey, you don't know how to hook this up, do you?<eos> HDMI dealy to get the whole high-depth thing.<eos> But I could do old-school VGA if need be.<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> Mr President, this is Scotty McNeil, from the Special Situations group.<eos> That's our apocalypse planning department.<eos> We have one of those?<eos> We certainly do, Mr President.
That's the address.<eos> You have no idea how many times I wanted to burn that piece of paper.<eos> How long will you be gone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come here.<eos> You be safe and you come home soon.<eos> We haven't got many days left.<eos> I don't want to be alone at the end.<eos> I know, Mum.<eos> None of us do.
Was it your new friend, huh?<eos> Cops know you're traveling together, so now you're an accessory to kidnapping, Perry.<eos> It wasn't supposed to be like this.<eos> No?<eos> Well, how was it supposed to go?<eos> I've, uh, misjudged the situation a bit, put trust in someone that's proven untrustworthy.<eos> And what if he kills her, huh?<eos> What then?<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone, Gene.<eos> You never do, Perry.
You remember.<eos> You... you... you took pity on me, and I am glad for it.<eos> Ray, where's Tracy?<eos> Call's coming from an unlisted number.<eos> He's on a burner phone.<eos> Still triangulating.<eos> The wind was blowing, and we just... we rolled down the windows even though it was cold.<eos> We didn't even care because the music was blasting on the stereo.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Yes, I do.
But that's not my personal money.<eos> They don't understand that.<eos> We're dealing with someone who's not too sophisticated.<eos> Yet this kidnapping was just the opposite.<eos> It's not adding up.<eos> Benjy, can't we borrow against your campaign fund?<eos> No.<eos> No, that's illegal.<eos> I--I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.
Many would agree with you.<eos> I doubt he is more formidable than General Johnny Burgoyne.<eos> When I surrounded him at Saratoga, he had no choice but to yield to my demands.<eos> Finally.<eos> I thought he'd never fall asleep.<eos> It's too much excitement for one day.<eos> He'll sleep soundly now, though.<eos> He's had his fill.<eos> He'll sleep soundly because his father's home.<eos> I did a lot of thinking in prison.
I hope you're proud of the position you put me in.<eos> I don't like being threatened.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Father, what did he say?<eos> It wasn't what he said so much as what he insinuated.<eos> A husband's duty is to protect his wife and family.<eos> And, as military governor, he would see to it that our family was protected from the patriot mob who now rule this city.<eos> I cannot marry that man.<eos> But he told me that he'd already proposed and you eagerly accepted.<eos> No, I... I did not.
- No. No.<eos> All right, then why don't you tell me what I have to do?<eos> You only have to kill his courier.<eos> - What?<eos> - Think about it.<eos> Hewlett will likely send one courier as he can't afford to spare a whole detachment.<eos> Eastin, yeah.<eos> You get ahead of him on the road, you ambush him, make it look like Simcoe did it, revenge for the men that he lost.<eos> Mary, I came to you for help.<eos> - You did the right thing.
'Darkness had fallen 'when we finally reached the bottom of the farm drive.'<eos> Joy of joys!<eos> 'But...it took another two hours to reach 'the farmhouse at the top of it...'<eos> ~ Welcome.<eos> ~ Thank you.<eos> '.. where there were no spare bedrooms.<eos> 'So I decided to try another new sort of tenting.'<eos> ~ Do you know what?<eos> ~ What? ~ We started this, I liked all three cars.<eos> I still do.
I can do that.<eos> Stacy can sub.<eos> I can't leave him like this.<eos> Leave him with me. I'll stay.<eos> I'm sorry, babe.<eos> Why?<eos> I love you.<eos> - Well, you're stupid. - Mmm.<eos> - Because you didn't sign up for this.<eos> - I did.
Where have you been?<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> - Travis, I said not to bring her.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - I know.<eos> We've both been looking for you.<eos> - Why wouldn't I?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I did a- - I did--<eos> - I did a bad thing.
- I did a- - I did--<eos> - I did a bad thing.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's okay, just get in the truck, Nick.<eos> - It's not okay.<eos> - Nicky, what happened?<eos> - Okay, so he-- he pulled a gun on me.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Who did?
Where?<eos> Nick!<eos> Where?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just...<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Calvin must have gone looking for him.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy.<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
Have you told her how you're going to save her?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> ! Give me the envelope, or I'll kill the kid!<eos> I will.<eos> Does she know about the bunker is all? What?<eos> !<eos> Does she know about the bunker?<eos> No, no.<eos> OK?<eos> She doesn't.
Before I asked you to move in with me... ..I checked there was no chance you were going to uni.<eos> I double checked, Rae.<eos> For me.<eos> Because the last thing I wanted to do in my life is to hold you back, do you know that?<eos> You're not holding me back.<eos> I went to the pub earlier, and you were all anyone was talking about.<eos> "Rae Earl's off to uni!<eos> "Aw, you must be so proud, mate." Do you know what that's like?<eos> Why would you lie to me?<eos> I didn't.
Can't.<eos> Chloe wouldn't want you to stop with your studies, would she?<eos> "No, Mum.<eos> "I need to pass my exams, so I can still go to Bristol."<eos> Why didn't people tell you when they were coming round?<eos> That way, you wouldn't have to answer the door looking like<eos> Joseph and his technicolor dreamcoat.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You can't force someone to drive.<eos> I did.
"No, Mum.<eos> "I need to pass my exams, so I can still go to Bristol."<eos> Why didn't people tell you when they were coming round?<eos> That way, you wouldn't have to answer the door looking like<eos> Joseph and his technicolor dreamcoat.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You can't force someone to drive.<eos> I did.<eos> Now her parents hate me. They won't hate you.<eos> Her mum does.
Me and Finn.<eos> When we saw you leaving.<eos> So I just wanted to check to see if you were OK.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> No. No, it's fine.<eos> He's a big softie, isn't he?<eos> I had no idea he was so sensitive.<eos> Well, don't you remember him from college?<eos> Never talked to me at college.<eos> No-one did.
I'm not going through all of this for us to both miss out on our exams.<eos> You're the only one who can do them anyway.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> I was joking...<eos> Oh.<eos> ..kind of.<eos> Promise me. You'll be brilliant at them.<eos> Rachel.<eos> I don't want to make a scene.<eos> Then don't.
So do you.<eos> You just look a bit more pyjama-y than I expected.<eos> I can't face it, Rae.<eos> What are you on about?<eos> Well... CHLOE SNIFFS<eos> W...<eos> Well, what happens next?<eos> Business college.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't...
Yeah, the power's pretty awesome, too.<eos> Speaking of which... he's literally riding in on a white horse.<eos> Well, you gonna lead a bloody coup, confidence is good.<eos> When Ayatollah Ruhmeini took power, we clashed on foreign policy and nuclear ambitions.<eos> I quit my post in protest.<eos> Next thing I know, his henchmen are following me, harassing my family.<eos> We barely made it out alive.<eos> This same lunatic still rules my beloved country.<eos> We understand you'd like to change that.<eos> - Do you?
You have a list?<eos> More like parameters.<eos> I think we're talking north of 40 here, with 35 as the floor for somebody really spectacular.<eos> (chuckles) Okay, I'm not Hugh Hefner.<eos> - 40 is just fine.<eos> - Good.<eos> And while I don't have a list of approved women...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have rejects?<eos> I do.
- I want to hear it from you. - (sighs)<eos> We believe her security detail was overrun.<eos> How-how is that even possible?<eos> It was a deliberately small footprint.<eos> Deliberately small.<eos> Elizabeth signed off on it to maintain covert mission integrity.<eos> You and the president knew the risk.<eos> You signed off on it, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Miss Denker will tell her ladyship that you're here.<eos> Oh, it was you I came to see, actually.<eos> Oh, m'lady, we're all ears.<eos> - She means alone.<eos> - Well, if I'm not wanted.<eos> - When were you last wanted?<eos> - I shall ignore that.<eos> Shall we sit down?<eos> If you're comfortable with me sitting in your presence, m'lady.<eos> - Well, we do in London.
A trick you could use.<eos> Good place to keep your things so they don't get swiped.<eos> Helps that they nail the headboard to the wall.<eos> You just have to nail it back.<eos> That should fetch a good price.<eos> Rent's due, isn't it?<eos> And after those runty bitches on the corner told everyone I serviced a leper, my regular customers fled.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> I, um...<eos> I didn't, of course.
You made me a liar, an accomplice in your treason.<eos> Do you forget how much Marcus suffered?<eos> How much you loved him as a boy?<eos> He carried you on his shoulders.<eos> Taught you how to hunt, how to shoot.<eos> Protected you from our father.<eos> Took blows for you, died betrayed.<eos> And you judge me for avenging him?<eos> What has this place done to you?<eos> You did this to me.
Fly safe.<eos> Bye.<eos> Whatever you did must have worked.<eos> I heard the CIA canceled the meeting with the Mujahideen and the Senate Armed Services Committee.<eos> So, Annelise finally pays off for you.<eos> The weapons stay out of your enemy's hands.<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> I don't think like that.<eos> I know a lot of young men who won't be blown out of the sky because of what I did-- what Annelise did.<eos> What we did.
I just need to know why he left Sewell Augustine so I can play to that.<eos> We'll get back as soon as we find something.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll talk.<eos> Hon, when we're out there we'll be divided up into blinds, right?<eos> Yes, two person blind.<eos> Why?<eos> It would be really helpful to have a captive audience.<eos> I thought we said three days no work, just fun.<eos> We did.

- Does it matter?<eos> - A little.<eos> Kyle, the truth is, I don't know why I'm doing anything right now.<eos> I'm just trying to make it through the day.<eos> - I get that.<eos> - But...<eos> I know I wanted to see you and I'm glad you're here.<eos> Carter's here.<eos> - I thought you had the place to yourself.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.
I never saw you come home.<eos> You and Dawson?<eos> Do you remember the woman I was talking to the other night at Molly's?<eos> Yeah, kind of hard to forget.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've been with her this whole time?<eos> What have you done with Matt Casey?<eos> Oh, get out of here.<eos> I deserve a little fun, get my mind off things.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
May I ask why didn't you deliver it in person like she asked?<eos> - Well, because she's fucking crazy. - Ah.<eos> She has been trying to shake down Vernon Littlefield. Now she's trying to shake down me.<eos> Trash like this is why I didn't want you here in the first place.<eos> - Joe mentioned that.<eos> - Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel on your very big fuckin' flat screen.<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.

Kirsten, wait.<eos> Fisher, come with me, please.<eos> When you woke up this morning, did you think<eos> - the day was gonna turn out like this? - Hm-mmm.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Come on. Will you wait?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I did not.
How long have you been spying on me for?<eos> Pretty much the entire last year.<eos> Look, after we became roommates,<eos> Maggie had me brought in here and made me an offer.<eos> They'd pay all my expenses and my grad school costs if I just spied on you.<eos> All your living expenses and your tuition costs?<eos> That is a pretty good offer.<eos> I know, right?<eos> And all I had to do was just keep track of you and report back if you did anything strange.<eos> And did you?
You deliberately brought in the Keller case to keep me from stitching into Ed's memory.<eos> You give me too much credit.<eos> Did they know?<eos> Were they a part of your plan...<eos> Camille, Linus and Cameron?<eos> No, because there was no plan.<eos> I'm sorry about Ed, but this happens sometimes.<eos> You promised me.<eos> No, I said that if you can solve the Keller case fast enough, you could stitch into Ed.<eos> You didn't.

A trucker just called in a reckless driver in a black SUV heading south on 232 and swerving pretty badly.<eos> Okay, I'll check it out.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> You all right?<eos> Am I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't feel my... anything.<eos> Come on, Barlow.<eos> Let's get you out of there.<eos> Easy does it.
Well, whoever it was knew Branch well.<eos> Knew where he hid his key.<eos> Knew how to get into his house.<eos> He typed a suicide note on his computer that sounded like Branch.<eos> With one exception.<eos> They didn't know that Branch and my daughter had broken up a few weeks ago.<eos> I understand Cady came by and broke the news to you.<eos> You think a father could kill his own son?<eos> You really think I'm capable of that?<eos> Well, I didn't before today.
Okay.<eos> So, uh, there's another way of thinking about this.<eos> Maybe the warehouse was robbed first before the Collette home invasion.<eos> Warehouse thieves shoot Lee McKinnon, steal his gun, hit the Collette house.<eos> Well, then why did the 911 calls come in a different order?<eos> If this security guard McKinnon really is an inside man, after the warehouse robbery, he lets his cohorts shoot him in the leg.<eos> Then he would have waited to call 911 to let his crew get away.<eos> Meanwhile, they use Lee McKinnon's gun in another robbery in another part of town.<eos> Didn't Trey and Jelly have an inside partner in their prescription-drug ring?<eos> Yes, they did.
But I am not involved in this.<eos> Although, in all honesty, you know what?<eos> I wish I was.<eos> Because it's been such a roaring success so far?<eos> No, because if I was involved, I could make sure that these people are actually getting the right medication.<eos> You know, it takes hours of testing to make a proper diagnosis, okay?<eos> You don't just... just, you know, do a couple Google searches, kick back some anti-depressants, and hope for the best.<eos> You actually have to know the person's medical history, their family history, you know, what kind of...<eos> So, you don't support this kind of psychiatric vigilantism?<eos> No, I don't.
Peter's not coming back.<eos> Your son and his friend were robbed last night, and during the course of the robbery, your son, Peter, he was shot.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What about Jerry?<eos> Is Jerry okay?<eos> Uh, Jerry's alive.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> So, I-I guess... I guess you know Jerry?<eos> Oh, I do.
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.<eos> How are you, Jerry?<eos> Well, I can't feel my legs.<eos> Come on back.<eos> So, I understand your friendship with Peter Hoyt was a little complicated.<eos> Oh. That.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That.<eos> So, you want to know how I could be friends with a man who shot me twice, permanently destroyed my digestive system, and took away the use of my legs.<eos> I do.
He made a mistake, and he paid for it.<eos> Keeping him in prison wasn't doing anything but keeping me from moving on.<eos> Forgiveness can set everybody free, Sheriff.<eos> Well, it takes a big man to think that way.<eos> Well, it doesn't happen overnight.<eos> But when it does, it opens up a whole world of possibilities.<eos> I just wish that Pete had, um... had more time to experience that.<eos> Well, I'm sure he was grateful for the time you got him.<eos> You think?<eos> I do.
So, Jerry, you said you were robbed by two men.<eos> Could one of them have been Cheyenne?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Were they big men?<eos> Small?<eos> Oh, big.<eos> And one of them might have had long hair.<eos> Did you or Peter take out a loan at the casino?<eos> I didn't.
But I'm at peace now.<eos> Hey, Ferg, I got a man in custody in your car.<eos> I need you and Vic to come pick him up.<eos> I'm near mile marker 10.<eos> They'll be along soon enough.<eos> It's all good.<eos> So, uh, Ruby called me.<eos> She said it was an emergency.<eos> I didn't say emergency.<eos> Well, she did.
Zachary?<eos> What you doing?<eos> The drawers stick.<eos> - Not for me, they didn't.
Yeah.<eos> That'd be you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Vic, come on.<eos> Obviously, you're pissed off about something, something about me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I am pissed off at myself 'cause I'm so stupid.<eos> - I thought you wanted me to call you.<eos> - I did!
There's no forwarding address.<eos> I know he's done some work for you, so I wanted to ask your permission for us to talk to him.<eos> I assume he's still working on the casino hotel construction.<eos> Why do you want to talk to one of my plumbers?<eos> Well, I have reason to believe that Sam Poteet might be involved in a murder.<eos> It has nothing to do with your casino.<eos> It happened up in Oden.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I appreciate the show of respect, Walt.<eos> I do.
Okay, bye.<eos> So Gab Langton isn't your daughter?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I thought we were talking white.<eos> In our culture, aunts and uncles are also mothers and fathers.<eos> We all have a responsibility of taking care of all the children.<eos> So Gab's your niece?<eos> No, she's my daughter.<eos> Either way, you know what happened to her.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, and if, uh, you can't get through, try again.<eos> Ferg, call Mathias, let him know what happened.<eos> Meantime, Vic and I will head to the hospital.<eos> Hope that Tyler's awake.<eos> And after Mathias is done complaining, maybe he can help me I.D. the Cheyenne girls from the bonfire.<eos> I know what they look like.<eos> I don't know where to find them.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> She did not see us.<eos> Or perhaps she did.
- What happened to your arm?<eos> - None of your business.<eos> One of Gab's rapists was shot last night with a .410 Snake Slayer.<eos> This is not my house.<eos> That is not my gun.<eos> The shooter was hit with a ricochet from my bullet when he was fleeing.<eos> Take off that bandage, Sam.<eos> No.<eos> You said you would leave if I took my shirt off.<eos> I did.
It was dark.<eos> She was probably traumatized.<eos> Or maybe she knew it was Gab and she lied just to throw us off the scent.<eos> Both Gab and Laila had reason to hate Tyler.<eos> You said there was a blood trail leading to a car.<eos> Gab doesn't have a car.<eos> Maybe she had help.<eos> It's also possible that someone other than Sam Poteet is the new Hector.<eos> I thought you knew where to go.<eos> I do.
Is that when your patient falls in love with you?<eos> More or less, yeah.<eos> Occupational hazard, I suppose.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Any of your suspects ever fall for you?<eos> Hope so.<eos> Hey, um, I thought I might see you here, so I brought you something.<eos> John Donne.<eos> I know you're busy, but you said you enjoyed him.<eos> No, I didn't.
I can get you front-row seats to see Usher!<eos> I'm gonna need your address, a key, and some holy water.<eos> Hey, Josh, I made you a little snack... chicken and waffles.<eos> No thank you. I'm not hungry.<eos> "Where's the maple syrup," you say?<eos> I didn't say.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm just saying the syrup's on the way over... from Vermont.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> - I did.
I was so worried, I paid Yolanda to watch me sleep.<eos> That's so sweet!<eos> - Did you do anything weird?<eos> - No.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Who cares what we do in our sleep?<eos> We can be ourselves.<eos> We love each other.<eos> - We do?<eos> - Well... I do.
So I don't know if these are related, but I also noticed these postmortem moustache-shaped fracture lines on the parietal.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's a standard two-pronged hook inside of a high school locker.<eos> The victim's head was shoved against it.<eos> Wait, how did you know that?<eos> Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
She was dedicated to her students, and all you did was think about yourself.<eos> If she turned you in, she would have ruined your career.<eos> Come on, some bits of eraser are not enough to prove somebody of murder.<eos> Actually, it is.<eos> There's more.<eos> To position Mia's body in your car, you used your steering wheel lock to break her bones and acetone to clean up, but... see, acetone doesn't mask blood.<eos> Lucky for us, he's not a science teacher.<eos> Lucky for us.<eos> You don't understand...<eos> No, I don't.

Oh, of course you do.
I want Marcus to stay.<eos> Mr. Parker wants me to stay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Parker, I called in that favor.<eos> See that woman down there?<eos> She's with the Justice Department.<eos> She's gonna oversee the investigation, make sure everything is done by the book.<eos> - You said you could get the Attorney General down here.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I did.
- You can't say anything.<eos> - I'm getting pummeled out there.<eos> - She's right, Cy.<eos> It can't look like I'm behind the curve.<eos> Anything you say right now will end up vilifying law enforcement.<eos> I was on duty.<eos> I, uh, heard over the radio that a kid had just shoplifted a cellphone from a store on Ambrose Street I'm driving on.<eos> About 10 seconds later, I see him walking.<eos> How do you know it's the same kid?<eos> I don't, of course, not at first.
Since what's the difference?<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> It does.<eos> There are some seriously bad pills out there, all right?<eos> And I really think we should<eos> - take you to a doctor...<eos> - The pills were fine.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> - Because I do.
As soon as he finds out I talked, they'll come for me.<eos> Okay, well then, we need to talk to the police.<eos> And tell them you need some kind of protection.<eos> I might need protection from the cops, too.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They could still say I was part of Shay's operation.<eos> But you had nothing to do with it.<eos> With a past like mine, you really think a judge is gonna believe me?<eos> Come on.<eos> Even you didn't.
And... I told her that I hadn't seen you.<eos> But we talked for a while 'cause I was going through the whole thing with my parents 'cause they had just completely disowned me and she reminded me that...<eos> This little world that I was living in didn't have to be my world, and I could find... my own life.<eos> Find myself.<eos> Yup, she was always really good at that stuff.<eos> I really didn't want you to be mad.<eos> But I talked to her before I reached out to you.<eos> I didn't even think that you wanted to talk to me, 'cause, you know, I wasn't there when everything went down.<eos> But Lori said you'd forgive me.<eos> - She did? - Yeah.
I mean, she could have died and you're acting like you wouldn't have even cared.<eos> Lori, she sent me here.<eos> I thought you came because your parents kicked you out.<eos> I think she was just trying to get me to lure<eos> Carter away from the Wilsons.<eos> I think that's maybe something that Carter should know.<eos> I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> - I don't want you to think that.<eos> - No, I don't.
It's a weekend in the woods, Bird, not a catalogue shoot.<eos> Yeah, well, I appreciate rustic as much as the next girl, but this is a little too much.<eos> I mean, knotty pine, really?<eos> Something has to be done.<eos> So, um... are you gonna talk to Carter about Lori?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When?<eos> I don't know, soon.<eos> Sorry, I... didn't mean to make you feel guilty.<eos> Well, you did.
Well, I have an idea.<eos> There's an event tonight at my parents' country club.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And Taylor's on a committee for some charity fashion show or something, and Carter's gonna be there.<eos> We should go.<eos> What's that for?<eos> This is gonna suck all that mean little bee poison that hurts so much right out of your arm.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> It just does.
When do we tell the kids?<eos> Well, there's a couple of grownups we should probably talk to first.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Is it gonna be a problem with Hillary?<eos> You guys have to teach together.<eos> You and Kyle have to work together.<eos> Touché.<eos> SAT scores?<eos> You had it on your calendar, too?<eos> - Of course I did. - Mm-hmm.
Get across the street.<eos> Damn!<eos> Bulletproof glass.<eos> Come on!<eos> Police!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Get back!<eos> Officers, please help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Just do it!
I'm glad you decided to call.<eos> After this case, it seemed like a good idea to get out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Believe it or not, this place used to be the spot back in the day.<eos> My old sergeant used to tell us how he'd bring his dates here;<eos> they'd order the lobster and load it up with that famous egg sauce.<eos> He swore it was a surefire aphrodisiac, and it never failed.<eos> Oh, in that case, two orders, please.<eos> You remember that undercover job we worked at that dance club that one time?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Derek's phone.<eos> - What kind of woman?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It matters.<eos> - It matters.<eos> She was perky, and she sounded happy and tall, with a lot of great hair.<eos> Hold.<eos> You saw her?<eos> How did you see her?<eos> I didn't.
I said, "Have you ever heard of the National Transportation Safety Board?<eos> How is that any different?<eos> - I'm sorry, I--<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> Harvey, I swear I didn't know that that made it a crime.<eos> You knew when I point-blank asked you, and you lied to me about it.<eos> Well, I thought that you would take care of it.<eos> How can I take care of it if you don't tell me the goddamn truth?<eos> Do you think that I didn't want to tell you the truth?<eos> - Then why didn't you?

Look, I just came by to give you this.<eos> I went into the Sonaris code, fixed the missing branch error.<eos> Not only that, this version targets older copies. It eradicates them.<eos> I muscled it up some, too, so it'll inoculate machines from future infection.<eos> I mean, it's... it's one hell of an antidote.<eos> I mean, it won't undo the damage done, but maybe you can use it to make things right.<eos> Or a sign of good faith to Jacob Wheeler.<eos> I don't care about Jacob Wheeler.<eos> Then screw him.<eos> Do it for Sara.
You're lucky she's here, cos if it was up to me, I'd shoot ya.<eos> But Rhonda is a good girl.<eos> And I think you should know that about her.<eos> You have a good night now, ma'am.<eos> Feeling it now, huh?<eos> The guilt?<eos> You need to let me go and give yourself up.<eos> I can't go back to jail.<eos> You need to know I didn't choose any of this.<eos> No, you did.
- Yeah, thank God for that.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> You just calling to bust some balls or what?<eos> Well, I was thinking about visiting, you know, bringing the girls.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too, if you want to make the drive over there.<eos> You really want me to come?<eos> You're not just saying that?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Of course I do.

Juvie.<eos> I got arrested at 15 for lifting money out the register at this shoe store I was working at.<eos> The cop who came told the owner if he charged me, I'd be swept into the system.<eos> "Can we let this slide?"<eos> And you know what the owner told him?<eos> Said I was never gonna be a damn thing.<eos> So I went to Kentville, and that was that.<eos> Yeah, I hear you.<eos> It's hard to, you know, turn ships once you're sailing downwind, but see, that officer... look, the one who answered the call... he tried to give that owner a way out.<eos> The police did that for you.

I got to talk to somebody.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Carl, you know me.<eos> There's only three things I ever wanted in my life.<eos> Be a cop, get married and be a dad.<eos> Yup, that's why I love you.<eos> You're a simple man with simple needs who's simply adorable.<eos> Carl, Molly doesn't want to have kids anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Of course she does.
Oh, honey.<eos> At least, when I went back on birth control, it was... you know, it wasn't my fault I couldn't get pregnant.<eos> It was the...<eos> it was the pill's.<eos> Sweetie... it's nobody's fault.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're in this together.<eos> Yeah, but what if we can't have a baby?<eos> I just need to know that you want to.<eos> I really do.
Now, what are the chances of that?<eos> One person being murdered twice in one night by two different people?<eos> Fortunately for us... .. some things in that room... told us the real story behind Annette's murder.<eos> An envelope containing an unused roll of sticky tape locked inside a safe, a bottle of whisky, a glass, and Annette's missing mobile phone.<eos> We know that you, Bill Williams, had serious financial problems.<eos> Annette Burgess was gonna let you sink.<eos> Killing her wouldn't have got you paid.<eos> But with your colourful history of angry outbursts...<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> I didn't.

Were you in the same cell for a while?<eos> I imagine, those long days inside, a clever man like yourself might have spotted an opportunity.<eos> An opportunity to take another man's identity and create a better, more prosperous future for yourself.<eos> And with your talent for forgery... .. creating a false DNA test, well... it must've been a walk in the park.<eos> Dominic... was such a loser.<eos> Half the time he didn't even know what day it was.<eos> And he blamed it all on his mum.<eos> Every night was the same - he'd start crying.<eos> "Did I tell you that she's Annette Burgess?"<eos> Yeah, you did... 300 times.
- Come on, you know you want it.<eos> - You don't know what I want.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
[glass clinking] yeah, right?<eos> I'm pretty sure there's a fireplace.<eos> [archer] there, see?<eos> Quaint little farmhouse.<eos> A cozy little fire going.<eos> I mean, this place is right out of a fairy tale.<eos> Yeah, a fairy tale in which the heroine<eos> Is drugged and kidnapped.<eos> You realize that's, like, every fairy tale?<eos> I do now...
Molly kept a diary?<eos> Handwritten?<eos> In a book?<eos> That's weirdly archaic.<eos> You can hide a book a lot easier than you can hide a computer.<eos> Plus, no one can hack a book off the cloud.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, did you find it?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
So why isn't there any sign of benzodiazepine in her tissue?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Science is not my thing.<eos> Yeah, making up a story isn't your thing either.<eos> Benzodiazepine is not an upper like Ritalin, Tyler, it's a sedative.<eos> Well, then she needed to relax, I guess.<eos> I don't know, she was high-strung.<eos> Why did you post her photo?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Let's cut it together.<eos> Oh. Big box.<eos> Kevin cut the cord when Jenna was born.<eos> Just cut the damn cake.<eos> I'm back!<eos> I couldn't commit to Biggie until I had a chance to see the world, so I decided to pull an "Eat, Play, Love."<eos> I skipped the Ashram part.<eos> Curry doesn't always agree with me.<eos> You don't want to know what curry does to a pregnant woman.<eos> No, we really don't.
Speaking of parade, what's up with the twirling?<eos> Did you not hear that F bomb I dropped on that Clement rep?<eos> I wanted to make a strong impression, but... not like that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What did Theo say?<eos> Not talking about it.<eos> I'm focusing on my future.<eos> Tomorrow, I will make a lasting second impression via my lifelong passion for baton.<eos> You don't have a lifelong passion for baton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.
But you flirted with me at that PFLAG event.<eos> And we talked all about your ex-boyfriend Aaron.<eos> Ex-girlfriend, actually.<eos> It was with an "E," not a double "A."<eos> But you're right.<eos> We've been flirting.<eos> So are you gay or straight?<eos> I'm bi.<eos> Had that not even occurred as a possibility to you two?<eos> - Of course it did. - Bi?
I'm here about castiel.<eos> Was there any of his grace left?<eos> Question is, are you willing to pay for it?<eos> He must be returned -- intact.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Told you last time i saw you i'd get out of the slammer.<eos> Sam: We need to know How to remove the mark of cain from dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the mark was so toxic?<eos> Ohh! Actually, i did.
Before she got famous?<eos> No.<eos> Before she hit on me.<eos> I told her I wasn't into girls.<eos> But... I think she was confused by the derby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think we're all a little confused by it.<eos> Nola, I want to ask you if you've ever had any success, but I don't know how to do that without insulting you.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You don't.
I would have picked you for a Gamma Moo.<eos> - Perky much?<eos> - Wow, a grown-up mean girl.<eos> Mommy issues?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Your dead pledge, Caroline, her mommy was your pledge master back in the day.<eos> - Treated you like crap, I'm guessing.<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Did Linda say where she was going?<eos> - She took our car service to 42nd and Park.<eos> - That's Grand Central.<eos> Laura.<eos> Silicon Linda is on the run.<eos> She could be heading anywhere.<eos> Race the clock.<eos> Trains are pulling out every minute.<eos> Okay, wait. I know how to slow 'em down.<eos> - You do?
- My buddy!<eos> Forever.<eos> Jake, I told you, when it's your night, you can't bring the boys back if they have a bad dream.<eos> Congrats on solving the case.<eos> I thought we could celebrate.<eos> And we're gonna see how champagne pairs with chili.<eos> That's so sweet, but I'm not in a celebrating mood.<eos> Why's that?<eos> I know you planned the perfect weekend for us.<eos> - You do?
!<eos> Pace we're going, we ain't never gonna get that damn pond drained!<eos> Well, we're still waiting on that last permit, Isaac.<eos> Protesters slowing everything down.<eos> We got this job based on our reputation<eos> - for being fast... real fast.<eos> - It's Oklahoma.<eos> You know better than anyone how the locals<eos> - feel about their tribal lands and whatnot.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
When I was watching your footage earlier,<eos> I could tell something was off with this place, but it's as if the walls...<eos> Aren't really where they are.<eos> How could you tell from a video?<eos> You know that thing where you're watching TV and you subconsciously compute the size of the sets based on the height of the actor and the number of steps it takes them to walk the width of them?<eos> Like, how Nathan Fillion is 6'2".<eos> Takes him 43 steps to walk across the Serenity, so you know that the spaceship is 204 feet across.<eos> No.<eos> No one knows that thing.<eos> Well, I do.
Jenkins and I gotta open the door and, let in the sunbeam, so... it's gonna get a little hot.<eos> Hey, we were all right.<eos> We were fine through the three months we were on our own?<eos> I mean, this... This is not gonna kill me.<eos> No, but we weren't fine.<eos> We weren't okay.<eos> I...<eos> I don't even know why we went our separate ways.<eos> It just happens to people.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Your average Tuesday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> We're gonna try to stop him.<eos> Okay, let's go home and make some plans.<eos> I already have a few ideas.<eos> Save them for the meeting.<eos> Meeting?<eos> Yeah, I don't really like meetings.<eos> No one does, Flynn.
Yeah.<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> We're gonna try to stop him.<eos> Okay, let's go home and make some plans.<eos> I already have a few ideas.<eos> Save them for the meeting.<eos> Meeting?<eos> Yeah, I don't really like meetings.<eos> No one does, Flynn.<eos> No one does.
Prospero's descended another level.<eos> When this happens in the movies, don't they try to, like, override the elevator or something?<eos> Indeed, they do, yes, but in the movies, usually, the elevators were made after the Reformation.<eos> Off... with... your head.<eos> Any ideas?<eos> Flynn said Fictionals don't have free will.<eos> They're bound by the nature of their story.<eos> Maybe we can use that against her.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, how does Alice defeat her in the book?<eos> Well, she doesn't.
I remember.<eos> You remember the Library?<eos> I remember Judson.<eos> Wise and brave and kind Judson.<eos> Your true father.<eos> A-and I remember Charlene.<eos> Funny and tough and loving Charlene.<eos> Do you, uh...<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Of course I do, Flynn.
Excuse me.<eos> Jenkins was right...<eos> Wexler equals weird.<eos> I wonder if thinking your small liberal arts school can beat Michigan is magical delusion or just regular delusion.<eos> Appareat!<eos> Diabolus!<eos> Ignis!<eos> Do I even want to know what they're cheering?<eos> No.<eos> You do not.
That's 18th century occult spiritualism.<eos> That's definitely magicy.<eos> We got to find the origin of this house.<eos> All right, I bet you anything Professor Bancroft would have something to say about these symbols.<eos> Okay, so, divide and conquer?<eos> Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.<eos> Stone and I will go talk to the professor.<eos> Admit it...<eos> You just don't want to go to a frat party.<eos> I really don't.
Do you know what we're looking for?<eos> There isn't a we.<eos> There is just me.<eos> And my... friend.<eos> And I am in no way saying that magic exists.<eos> It's so great that you have a team to work with.<eos> I would love that.<eos> Or do you call yourselves a squad?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Ah! Stupid bloody brick.<eos> Lightning must've fried all the codes.<eos> No, that's not a code problem.<eos> That's magic.<eos> Some sort of blocking spell.<eos> It's not Hittite.<eos> It's not Ashanti twi.<eos> Oh, it's Druid.<eos> We got this.<eos> We do?
I have one problem.<eos> The only problem that I have... he was born in St. Louis, Missouri.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Look it up.<eos> I'll wait here.<eos> Muy caliente.<eos> Show me what you got, ladies.<eos> Oh, yes, beautiful.<eos> Hey, uh, you messed up there.<eos> No, I didn't.
Please, just this once, let me be the big brother.<eos> What do you need us to do?<eos> Speed run.<eos> Cassandra, the Thaumatite is held in an EM containment field, like for plasma,<eos> - but with magnetic mirrors on both sides.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> I gotta figure out a way to bleed off some of this pressure. There's a shutoff on the third line.<eos> The vacuum effect will super-cool the adjacent pipes, allow you to access the flow controls.<eos> I wouldn't have thought of that.<eos> You did... eventually.
What?<eos> Birthday sushi.<eos> These are all right.<eos> That's a nice top.<eos> It's amazing, isn't it?<eos> You just wouldn't know, would you? What are you doing?<eos> Did she tell you from the off?<eos> That she used to be a bloke?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
You think I'm just being crazy?<eos> I mean, if it was your grandfather, what would you do?<eos> I don't have a grandfather, but my grandmother raised me, and if I thought someone was messing with her, I'd turn over every stone until I knew damn sure she was safe.<eos> But I might be a little crazy, too.<eos> Listen, get me fingerprints or DNA, and I can take this to the next level.<eos> Just let me know what you want.<eos> That was nice meeting Father Barnes.<eos> I think you're in good hands.<eos> So, uh... did you read the letter?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Why?<eos> You didn't try to.<eos> I didn't think of it.<eos> - You didn't want to.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Marianne,<eos> I liked you as soon as I saw you.<eos> - Do you love me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> No, you don't.
You could die.<eos> Yes, I am scared.<eos> Of course I'm scared, but what else can I do?<eos> You could...<eos> Lie to Dominique?<eos> Lie my whole life?<eos> - He might look like Gilbert.<eos> - Maybe he'd understand.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But what if he didn't?
You know, I still can't believe you're going out with me.<eos> I mean, you could have your pick of any guy, and I'm a little bit older, and you're probably a lot smarter, and feel free to stop me at any point.<eos> Well, maybe this will make you feel more secure.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but... the numbness has traveled to my knuckle, and at this rate, it will reach my heart in 36 hours, so...<eos> Ironically, you figured that out, when you're actually gonna die by being thrown off a terrace.<eos> I know you don't care that I'm sick, but Dr. McManus swore an oath, and I'm sure<eos> - she won't mind a quick exam.<eos> - Okay, Felix, I think you're overreacting, and I don't have my instruments, so...<eos> - I've got my own.<eos> - Of course you do.
Not what they taught us in lady doctor school.<eos> But I have to say, your attitude is so refreshing.<eos> I spend my whole life surrounded by hypochondriacs like Felix.<eos> - Oh, I love the guy, but he's a nut. - Yeah.<eos> He's convinced he's dying of an imaginary disease called SNeRD.<eos> Oh, actually, that's real.<eos> It is?<eos> Yeah, it's a horrible disease.<eos> In fact, I saw a patient today who's terrified she might have it.<eos> But she doesn't, right?
Oh, I didn't just win.<eos> I beat you like a dirty rug.<eos> Okay, except nobody cleans rugs like that anymore 'cause we don't live on The Waltons.<eos> Don't be a sore loser.<eos> I'm not sore.<eos> In fact, I'm not a loser at all... look!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> You didn't let me win.<eos> Yes, I did.
They all end the same way.<eos> "It's your fault, Oscar."<eos> And that ends round one.<eos> Now, why don't we all take a breath and calm down, hmm?<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> I'm gonna go out on the balcony.<eos> Yes, that's an excellent place to summon your flying monkeys!<eos> If I could make a tiny suggestion.<eos> Sometimes when you're around Gaby, you get a little defensive.<eos> - No, I don't.
What was I supposed to do?<eos> Give her a sonogram?<eos> I mean, I can't do everything...<eos> Sorry, I... interrupted you.<eos> What were you gonna say?<eos> I... I was gonna say why-why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well, I wanted to surprise you, and I figured if the horse came in, then I could buy you that vintage music box you were looking at.<eos> Oh, my God, I loved that music box.<eos> How do you even remember that?<eos> I just did.
- Thank you, Officer.<eos> - You're welcome, ma'am.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> NYPD, let's go.<eos> Makes sense why you were trying to keep a low profile at the hotel.<eos> You're famous.<eos> Rosie Webb, out of Vedra Beach, Florida star witness in the ongoing Barry Madden trial.<eos> Says here you helped him bilk billions from innocent investors.<eos> Just 'cause I work with the guy, doesn't mean I helped him steal.<eos> So you didn't?
Actually, I've kind of noticed you checking her out in the rearview.<eos> You're so pretty, Carrie.<eos> I mean, I'd kill for pores like that.<eos> Can I get my video game back again?<eos> If you promise to stop talking, okay?<eos> Come on, get up there!<eos> No!<eos> You guys, are we gonna pull over soon?<eos> 'Cause Doc says I got to move every couple hours, or the fluid builds up, and that's when the gastro esophageal reflex kicks in, and you do not want to smell it.<eos> No, we do not.
Really?<eos> Mm.<eos> You can take her back to the bar.<eos> Whatever happened to our private drink?<eos> Oh, Kenny will set you up.<eos> Don't turn around, we're being watched.<eos> I have a clue.<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> You don't dance.<eos> - I do now. - Oh.
Here.<eos> Do you smell that?<eos> - What?<eos> - Cologne.<eos> That's it?<eos> Thank you, Delina.<eos> No problem.<eos> Any time.<eos> All right, I just sent you the report.<eos> You did?
They were working in a very dangerous part of the world.<eos> They knew the risks.<eos> Still it's... it's hard.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> So then it's just you and your sister?<eos> Yeah, we're all that's left.<eos> Would you ever move back to Paris?<eos> No, my work is here now.<eos> But I thought you quit the bank.<eos> I did.
February 9, 2001, full moon.<eos> I remember you ditched me to play blackjack all night.<eos> Yeah, and I came back to the hotel room $8,000 up.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
He slept with Kalinda.<eos> He slept with Ramona.<eos> He screwed hookers.<eos> Then tell the truth.<eos> I am. No, at your interview.<eos> If I do that, I won't get elected.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> To your knowledge, Mrs. Florrick, has Lemond Bishop contributed money to your campaign or PACs supporting your campaign?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did?
Yeah.<eos> Oh, crazy flight.<eos> (Charles) Oh, those hydraulics were loud.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah, bonjour, bonjour.<eos> Two whiskeys, please, Chantelle.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Say, I'm looking for an old sky pal of mine.<eos> Do you know Roger Peralta? Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Jake, you don't understand.<eos> There was a downdraft on the Drummondville runway.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Yeah, clearly.<eos> Look, I've been making excuses for you my whole life, but you're a pretty crappy father, and until you're ready to be a good one, don't call me.<eos> Also I'm taking your captain hat because it's cool, and I want it.<eos> I got to say, figuring out Captain Holt didn't know the answer was an incredible solve.<eos> I'm sorry if we implied you weren't smart.<eos> Oh, and I'm sorry if we implied you're both asexual nerds who can only be friends with service animals.<eos> You didn't.
I was quite addicted to narcotics.<eos> A great variety of them, in fact.<eos> Blackouts were not uncommon.<eos> And on this night in particular, the 7th of December, 2011?<eos> I do not believe I could be much clearer.<eos> I have no recollection of this woman or anything that might have happened to her.<eos> Guys, it's a note.<eos> Received by our Vic the day she disappeared, one your consultant just admitted he wrote.<eos> She was a cleaner, maybe he wanted to hire her. Before we came here, you said this was a waste of time, you knew your guy.<eos> I do.
Prentice.<eos> I know you?<eos> We had a brief physical relationship.<eos> Perhaps this will jog your memory.<eos> I lost this a couple of days ago.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mr. Gutierrez, I bear you no ill will.<eos> You learned my name from the detectives investigating Maria's murder, and you took matters into your own hands.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Of course you do.
Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm being arrested.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, you're under arrest for the murder of Maria Gutierrez.<eos> You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.<eos> Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.<eos> All I could get out of my buddy at the 3-5 was that some new witness came forward.<eos> Someone who said they saw Sherlock kill Maria?<eos> No, someone who says they heard him threaten her life a few days before she disappeared.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.
When we compel a DNA sample from you, it's going to match.<eos> Between that and Eddie Bynum, who I'm confident is going to tell us his boss put him up to giving a false statement last night, you might want to tell your attorney he's got his work cut out for him.<eos> The witness, Eddie Bynum, folded pretty quickly.<eos> So did Matthew Hatano.<eos> When the councilman saw the writing on the wall, he told us everything.<eos> He did kill Kelsey Prior, and then, a few nights later, he killed Maria.<eos> The same night I met with her.<eos> Was he following her?<eos> He never knew about you.<eos> What he did, he did a few hours later.
Hey, Buddy.<eos> Oh, don't call a cop "buddy." They hate that.<eos> No, that's his name.<eos> I sold him a condo.<eos> - Phil?<eos> - Yeah, buddy.<eos> The four of us were at dinner.<eos> I can vouch for it.<eos> If you're looking to solve a crime, this one here had red wine with fish.<eos> Oh, I did. I did.
Just, you know, happier, warmer.<eos> Even more?<eos> All right.<eos> From Jay's line.<eos> And... action.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it!<eos> Cut.<eos> - You see that was exactly the same, right?<eos> - I do.
- He stinks.<eos> He's the worst.<eos> So bad.<eos> And, um... strictly from a keeping-my-job standpoint, it would be so dope if you told him that.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I can't fire my dad!<eos> I know.<eos> I know. It must be hard, but you realize it's the best thing for the company.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And I think I might be ready to give it to you.<eos> It's not sex.<eos> Then never mind.<eos> Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.<eos> Saves time.<eos> Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.<eos> And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.<eos> No, I don't.
Why?<eos> And don't tell me I know why.<eos> Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.<eos> What I know is something happened, and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.<eos> I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't say that--<eos> Because you pity me?<eos> Yeah, you did.
You either can't answer or you won't, which is bullshit, because obviously, you don't just look at me this way.<eos> You're capable of looking at me that way, but you don't want to let those worlds collide because you're afraid to risk anything.<eos> Because we have everything.<eos> No, Harvey.<eos> You have everything.<eos> So you're saying you want everything?<eos> I don't know, Harvey, but what I do know is I don't want your pity.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Nobody finds out where I live.<eos> I do.
It just sucks.<eos> You goddamn liar.<eos> Oh, don't be mad.<eos> Yeah, Conchita tells everybody I'm not home.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> DuPont Investments dropped through the floor today, and you sold short based on something that I told you in confidence.<eos> I don't recall you telling me anything at all.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You made over $100 million on that trade.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Drop dead.<eos> Eric, please.<eos> The reason I knew to look for someone that you cared about was that Forstman did the same thing to me.<eos> He finds your weakness and presses down until you don't have the will to stand up to him.<eos> With you, it was an ex-wife with Alzheimer's.<eos> With me... it was a little brother addicted to gambling.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't have proof, and you're not gonna get it in the next 24 hours.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
But, no, not that.<eos> But, yes, he should come!<eos> If Gene wants to learn to be a man of action, this is taking action!<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Come on, Gene.<eos> Let's go get our refund!<eos> Refund road trip!<eos> I forgot my keys!<eos> Yeah, he did!
Exactly.<eos> I'm going nowhere.<eos> Yes.<eos> ...I want you to know this is going to be on you.<eos> We'll, uh, we'll be here f...<eos> She just hung up on me.<eos> Rough call?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, thank you, Mr. Beale.<eos> I don't.
But instead you insist on this folly, of playing cops and robbers on some Godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere.<eos> It isn't the middle of nowhere!<eos> I'm...<eos> I am a DI.<eos> I'm a good detective.<eos> So, really?<eos> Why did a man die in your custody?<eos> And where's the killer?<eos> I wanted so much more for you than this, Humphrey.<eos> I really did.
Nice food appears in my room.<eos> These women... did you...<eos> Some of them.<eos> Most of them.<eos> Then I stopped.<eos> Why?<eos> Waking up next to strangers that they chose for me...<eos> I understand.<eos> Do you?<eos> Maybe you do.
Israelis.<eos> People who I thought were my friends, But they traded me like a slave to these...<eos> These monsters who never let me speak to anyone. Or even send a message home.<eos> All my son knows is that one day, I didn't come home.<eos> Maybe I died.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Or maybe i... Abandoned him.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> I lived most of my life here, nina, But I never knew anyone. Who would do something like this.<eos> I did.
There's no motive to kill him.<eos> Whereas with me...<eos> Does anyone outside of the program know the nature of your work here?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> But what about inside the program?<eos> Tim from engineering never liked me.<eos> The more probable scenario is Mr. Peterson was involved with some bad people.<eos> It seems like he hardly left his apartment.<eos> You never know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> I do.
Ever since that phone call this morning.<eos> All of the extra precautions at the lab,<eos> - and all of this hovering.<eos> - I'm being responsible.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No. You don't.
Oh, no.<eos> Now.<eos> Uh... hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Again.<eos> Didn't you use to live in the apartment below?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Let's go, hippie.<eos> Hey, Beth.<eos> So, you said that JJ rented a room from you?<eos> Do you ever keep any paperwork?<eos> All I asked from my boarders is that they pay on time and in cash.<eos> JJ couldn't even manage that.<eos> Hmm. But how was I supposed to pay my bills when you abandoned me?<eos> You haven't called once in five years!<eos> Beth, JJ must have told you his last name when you first met him.<eos> Maybe he did.
Do we have confirmation of any monies distributed by this Local Hero Fund to 9/11 families?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> To any families?<eos> To officers killed in the line of duty?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, we can't run down paperwork because the fund is, by their own admission, not licensed by the city or state.<eos> Well, try doing it retail.<eos> I did, sir.
Do you want to come?<eos> Or we could just do lunch. Let's do lunch.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Nice to...<eos> nice to meet you, KC.<eos> Fawn is none of my business, and Schmidt seems to really like her, so whatever happens, I'm just not getting involved.<eos> Then why are you on your way to hang out with him? What are you doing?<eos> He said to come over.<eos> He said it was an emergency.<eos> What if he does something sexy?
No more laughing.<eos> How do we begin?<eos> With more laughing.<eos> Are you aware that your laugh is now the number-one selling ringtone on iTunes?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> No. - It is?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> - You didn't know this?<eos> - I didn't.
The president asked you to serve, and you said yes.<eos> So before you turn your back on a job that only 47 people have had in the history of this nation, I need to hear why you said yes in the first place.<eos> I have a 10-year-old daughter.<eos> Her name is Casey.<eos> I want her and every other child in this country to grow up in a nation that will allow them to fulfill their dreams just like I'm doing right now.<eos> Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
In that right direction.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you're looking for your mouth guard case, it's, um... I put it in the dishwasher. It was gross, so...<eos> Abby.<eos> I fired you.<eos> I was right to fire you, and if you can't handle that, if you can't handle me doing my job, me having some power... if dating a woman who's one of the big dogs<eos> is too hard for you, then I'm fine being dumped.<eos> You can get your petty ass out of my...<eos> Do it again.
- What is Satan's problem this time?<eos> What, does he want to watch?<eos> 'Cause that costs extra!<eos> Hey!<eos> No. You have a heart condition.<eos> Sit.<eos> He is in breach of contract.<eos> I want that whore out of my house.<eos> The contract says I can have a life as long as I'm discreet.<eos> Yes, it does.
Are you?<eos> Are you, ma'am?<eos> How generous.<eos> How selfless.<eos> I cannot tell the difference between you and Mother Teresa.<eos> Where are we with the guest list?<eos> Just waiting to hear back from Michael's parents before doing the seating arrangements.<eos> My parents?<eos> You invited my parents?<eos> Of course we did.
I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but...<eos> For months, the president has been working backroom deals in order to present an immigration bill to Congress that won't Peter out due to partisan politics.<eos> He wants to craft legislation that can actually pass so that he can actually make a difference.<eos> But if this story runs, if one of the most respected newspapers in the country calls him out on this...<eos> He'll be forced to push through some half-assed bill just to save face.<eos> He'll lose his political clout on the Hill, and all that back-scratching and horse trading will go straight out the window.<eos> Immigration will be dead.<eos> And w-who knows what else will be killed in its path?<eos> I-I-I want us to have an amazing time on our honeymoon.<eos> I really do.
Oh. Boy.<eos> I just heard that.<eos> You probably think there's something between me and Gloria.<eos> Relax.<eos> I couldn't be more relaxed if I was in a coma.<eos> Jay's grill was delivered.<eos> She's keeping it under wraps so I can be there when he sees it!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> I just got accepted into Caltech.<eos> You did? !
And don't worry about the money.<eos> I got my bonus.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Did you pay back my dad?<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way, I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore.<eos> Fine!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
It's okay.<eos> Let's just sit down.<eos> Listen, we just wanted to ask if you think I cry too much.<eos> And you can be honest.<eos> I don't want to answer 'cause you might cry.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> - Oh! She cares about my feelings!<eos> Okay, Lily, we think that maybe you don't get emotional because daddy gets, you know, so emotional because he kind of handles<eos> - the emotions for the entire house, you know?<eos> - I do.
Yes!<eos> I hate this family.<eos> Phil, I need to talk to you, man to man.<eos> I think Mitchell's having an affair.<eos> What?<eos> I was going through his wallet and I found a receipt to The Avian Hotel.<eos> It's probably some fancy French place where he's meeting his lover for their secret weekly rendezvous.<eos> Has he said anything to you about the unit upstairs?<eos> You gasped.<eos> Only because you did.
Cybermen suppress emotion.<eos> Daleks channel it... through a gun.<eos> That's why they keep yelling, "Exterminate."<eos> It's how they reload.<eos> So, let's go and kill them.<eos> Come on.<eos> There is a question, Doctor. One I have longed to ask.<eos> Yeah, well, if you're going to put your hand on my knee, it isn't going to go well.<eos> Why did you leave Gallifrey?<eos> Well, because I did.
Why?<eos> It's a boring place, Gallifrey.<eos> I was going out of my mind.<eos> Yet you long to return.<eos> Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.<eos> But it is always the same lie.<eos> What lie?<eos> You weren't bored.<eos> No-one runs the way you have run for so small a reason.<eos> I do.
At least that's what they claim.<eos> The big plan is to throw oil on capitalist pigs, embarrass them on the news or something.<eos> All right, we're already late for this threat assessment meeting.<eos> Just grab your files, and let's go.<eos> Al... you seriously...<eos> You smell like weed, man.<eos> I'm in a windowless van with a bunch of guys ripping bong hits.<eos> - So, yeah, I smell a little bit. - [Phone chirps]<eos> Did you try a little, though?<eos> You did, right?
Through there, Robbie.<eos> I'll need to speak to everyone who works here.<eos> - Well, we're pretty busy.<eos> - Somewhere quiet, please.<eos> - Shane Harris?<eos> - No, I'm Brad Pitt.<eos> DS Cabbot.<eos> This is DC Lang.<eos> We want a word.<eos> - Yeah, well, I don't.
- Can you describe him?<eos> - Didn't look like a student.<eos> Just like your average, middle-aged white guy.<eos> Don't know what was going on. Some sort of argument.<eos> Anyway, this lad stormed out and the older bloke went after him.<eos> Did you see where they went?<eos> Now what?<eos> Do you fancy a rocky road?<eos> - How well did you know Josh Tate?<eos> - I didn't.
Um... This.<eos> Way to sell it.<eos> You sure this isn't a problem?<eos> Not at all.<eos> My son's spending the week with his dad, so we have an extra room.<eos> Well, this is, uh, really nice of you.<eos> Hey, it's what we do.<eos> Someone took me in when I was in trouble.<eos> That was me.<eos> I did that.
That's crying.<eos> I deserve... a raise.<eos> I think...<eos> What?<eos> I deserve a raise.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> I deserve a raise.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> You know what?<eos> You do.
Now if you need anything in terms of firepower, you let me know.<eos> You need shotguns, I got shotguns.<eos> You need hand grenades, machine guns, explosives.<eos> You let me know.<eos> I got it.<eos> You wanna blow up a goddamn car, I'll set you up.<eos> Give you no shit to send a car over the river into New Jersey, no sweat.<eos> [Click] We're done here.<eos> All right. You need anything, you know where to find me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - [Chuckles]
Tonight, you caught us in a very forgiving mood.<eos> On almost any other night, what would we do, bull?<eos> We'd throw your asses in the paddy wagon and send you to the tombs.<eos> But tonight we're gonna make an exception because I assume a lot of you - are probably first-time offenders.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> In order to let you go, we need to identify the men that organized this game.<eos> If we do that, you can all be on your merry way.<eos> And if we cannot do that, you are all gonna get locked up, and we can figure it out tonight in a jail cell, and, ladies, that includes you, too.<eos> Understood?<eos> - Who did it, huh?
If we lived here in Central Park South, life would be grand.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - It's Richie.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Is my cousin here?<eos> No, he took off.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> I don't know, but he took all his shit.<eos> You don't know where he went?<eos> No, I don't.
Thanks, Joe, but I'm not really in the mood for company.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Doc?<eos> If I say no, will it stop you?<eos> When you went to see Kate just before she took off, did you talk to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Did it seem to you like she was having second thoughts?<eos> Not that I was aware of.<eos> Then don't you think -- That it's none of our business?<eos> - Yes, I do.
What are you doing here?<eos> Today seemed like a good day to come back for a visit.<eos> I had plans. But as it turns out, I got the rest of the day for you.<eos> - Only because you sabotaged the wedding.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you or did you not get up out of your seat right before the ceremony was supposed to start to tell Kate that you loved her?<eos> I...<eos> I had a momentary irrational impulse that I resisted.<eos> So you didn't talk to her right before she was about to walk down the aisle?<eos> - Yes, I did, but --
Hey, boss, if we rode together, we could do a short phone tutorial.<eos> Its' not going to be in Spanish, is it?<eos> Not to beat a dead horse, Too late.<eos> but how did you feel when Goose's jet went down and Maverick is holding dead Goose in his arms?<eos> Goose died?<eos> Yes, Goose died!<eos> What do you think the point of the movie is?<eos> !<eos> Didn't you watch it?<eos> Yeah, I did, most of it.
We need to find out who they were.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Boss.<eos> Got something?<eos> There was another agent working undercover with Mike Franks and me.<eos> Jenny Shepard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, her backstopped name was Miranda Flemming.<eos> You remember that name, Michelle?<eos> Yes, I do.
Apparently, he went to med school.<eos> Supposed to be a big shot doctor.<eos> Um, doctor's a completely different track than an enlisted sailor.<eos> Well, whatever his track, the jerk started demanding items that weren't... on the menu.<eos> When I refused, he got upset, made a scene.<eos> He lay a hand on you?<eos> I know how to handle tantrums.<eos> I calmed him down, and told him I'd send in an... another girl.<eos> One with a more eclectic menu?<eos> And did you?
This is fighting for us.<eos> No, this is running away.<eos> We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
Director Cooper, if you will.<eos> Look, I told you what happened with Tom Keen.<eos> - This is not my fault.<eos> - You vouched for him personally, Bill.<eos> I hired him on your recommendation.<eos> - The merchandise was defective.<eos> - No. He was perfect.<eos> Test scores, aptitude.<eos> There was no indication he would become emotionally involved.<eos> - But he did.
Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Relevance.<eos> The defense opened the door.<eos> They argued their constitutional rights shielded them from culpability.<eos> - We merely want to explore that right.<eos> - Yes, seems fair to me.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> - You were saying, Mr. Fife?<eos> Oh, I just saw Ms. Crozier making a signal towards you, Mr. Fife. Would you care to explain?<eos> - Oh, no, I didn't.
- makes a big difference, too. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - As does your infill setting... - Right.<eos> - We're finding, on the new...<eos> - Hello.<eos> May I borrow Mr. McVeigh for a moment?<eos> Yes.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> I heard you tied the knot.<eos> We did.
Of us.<eos> No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What's this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's too far away.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - You amended the suit.<eos> Oh, yes, we did.
Am I, am I, am I setting you up?<eos> The 18 million you wanted donated... is that a scheme with David Lee?<eos> I really have...<eos> No idea what you're talking about.<eos> You wanted your stocks liquidated and given to a Palestinian charity?<eos> - I what...?<eos> - The donor's family.<eos> You wanted 18 million given to them.<eos> You wanted to do good.<eos> No, I didn't!
I needed a poultice.<eos> Oh, and so you used my...<eos> My mother gave me that scarf.<eos> I was gonna wear it to our lunch tomorrow.<eos> Well, that's curious.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, as well as being an enthusiastic practitioner of maternal judgment, Mary Watson is also a model of consistency.<eos> You don't usually dine until the third Monday of each month, so why the change?<eos> All I know is that she sounded unhappy when she called me, so I thought I'd buy myself some grace by wearing the present that she gave me.<eos> Oh, well, then I did you a favor.
Mary!<eos> Act naturally.<eos> We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> How did you get her to, uh...<eos> I called her up earlier and I convinced her that she'd forgotten your birthday the other month.<eos> But she didn't.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Extra care here, gentlemen.<eos> Let's get these beauties home to Greece with all their fingers and toes.<eos> The ones they still have anyway.<eos> We'll take them from here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm taking these statues.<eos> I have no authorization to release these to anyone.<eos> Now you do.
Jason's tarts?<eos> Michael said he was helping Katrin.<eos> Sounds about right.<eos> He was always a sucker for a sob story.<eos> He's a nice guy.<eos> That's why I married him.<eos> He were lovely, Michael.<eos> Always polite.<eos> Always took really good care of his kid.<eos> ~ Then they do this.
And then Katrin...<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Katrin Vesik was looking for her sister ~ and found out about the slaves, didn't she?<eos> ~ No comment.<eos> That's why she was killed, wasn't it?<eos> ~ To shut her up.<eos> ~ No comment.<eos> Do you know what the Coroners and Justice Act is?<eos> He does.
A tragic accident, rush of blood.<eos> Spencer's committed a crime but it's a crime I can understand.<eos> What I can't comprehend... .. is what you two did next.<eos> You covered it up, didn't you?<eos> Spencer told us.<eos> You drove Josh Tate's body out to the ravine and you tossed him away like he was a piece of rubbish.<eos> We were protecting Spencer.<eos> It's the arrogance that gets me.<eos> You two decided that your son's life was so much more important than Josh Tate's.<eos> Well, of course we did.
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Damn it, no, it doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah, just hold it down, hold it down.<eos> Okay, you guys know the drill.<eos> We split up into teams, and we hunt this spider.<eos> - Why can't we just call an exterminator?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They've all blocked Schmidt's calls since the dandelion incident.<eos> It moved like a spider, Nick!<eos> I don't know a Cece.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Took a lot of cajoling.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> - Normally, it's, like, she'll come over all the time.<eos> But now it's diff...<eos> I don't know why that would be the case at all, but that's cool...<eos> I respect the decision for her to come over.<eos> Why are you acting weird?<eos> I'm acting weird?<eos> - Mm. - Do you know something?<eos> Do...?
Oh, Nick...<eos> It's legit terrible.<eos> Well, you taste for texture not taste you big old...<eos> Not really what I was looking for at this stage.<eos> Definitely affects my confidence.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> The only person that Cece could like that she wouldn't want to tell me about... is Nick!<eos> Uh... Does Cece like Nick?<eos> Does Cece like...?
Lisa's always fine.<eos> No worries there.<eos> (barking) Aw. What are you doing here?<eos> I bet you escaped, and now Flanders is worried sick.<eos> I should call him...<eos> after I scratch your tummy! That's right!<eos> Who likes their tummy scratched while Flanders is worried sick?<eos> You do!<eos> You do!<eos> Yes, you do!
Wait. But how did you have an extra room for Maggie?<eos> Well, that's where I used to grow my weed.<eos> But that's a story for another day.<eos> Never mind, never mind.<eos> Well, I didn't think she'd make it, but I was wrong.<eos> I guess your grandmother just wants to stick around to see those boys grow up.<eos> ♪ Amazing grace ♪<eos> ♪ How sweet the sound... ♪<eos> Loud singing could kill her.<eos> HOMER: And it did.

- Cool.<eos> New axe?<eos> 'Cause it's... It's killer.<eos> Same one I played in the Heathens.<eos> I... It's just that it's so...<eos> You keep it so, you know, shiny, it just looks like... brand-new.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> There's always this weird, you know, like, vibe between us.<eos> I don't...
The famine?<eos> Ireland, 1845.<eos> The awful blight upon the potato crop?<eos> It's called An Gorta Mor.<eos> Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now?<eos> No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
My God.<eos> I mourn it still.<eos> I think about everything that could have been, had they all lived, my friends.<eos> Andy, Keith.<eos> Robert.<eos> All that...<eos> loss. Were those guys you killed?<eos> He won't last a week.<eos> You want to say that to my face?<eos> I just did.
He won't last a week.<eos> You want to say that to my face?<eos> I just did.<eos> Tristan, would you give us a minute?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I can't believe you turned him.<eos> He's a stupid trashy model.<eos> And you were a pathetic addict dying on a filthy floor.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> I still don't.
We're losing him.<eos> I hear she checked out.<eos> Who did?<eos> That shit-don't-stink fashion editor.<eos> Guess this place wasn't up to her standards.<eos> Not everyone can appreciate it here.<eos> All this lovely darkness.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No.<eos> I really don't.
But he wasn't in the city.<eos> His killer... took him to his ranch up in Wineville.<eos> Oh, God, help me!<eos> He haunts my dreams.<eos> His woeful eyes pierce me with accusations.<eos> Why weren't you careful Mommy?<eos> Didn't you love me, Mommy?<eos> Of course I loved him!<eos> At least you know what happened to your boy.<eos> But I don't.
She manages The Cortez.<eos> Hell's wrong with her?<eos> She's kind of a drunk.<eos> She'll sober up.<eos> Drunk, huh?<eos> You want to take down The Countess?<eos> So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.
It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
I've been newly motivated.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> I love a good humiliation.<eos> What did she do to you that she hasn't already done?<eos> She took me back. Yeah.<eos> The Countess told me she made a mistake, and I was the one.<eos> Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.

You would just be doing your job.<eos> My job is to arrest them.<eos> And how does that make you feel?<eos> When you collar a man, as opposed to letting your fists be jury and judge?<eos> If it was up to me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.<eos> I know. I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
What I really loved about this project was its simplicity of statement.<eos> The elegance of a round number... ten.<eos> Which makes it even more vexing I was never able to complete it.<eos> Finish my work, John.<eos> Make it your own.<eos> I'll get caught.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You won't get caught.<eos> Because you're going to make yourself lead detective on the case.<eos> Do it in loving memory of your only begotten son.
Do the plants in the waiting room need watering?<eos> Is the bathroom out of T.P. again?<eos> Sara, stop.<eos> Everything's fine with the office, but I'm glad you assume the only reason<eos> I'm actually here with some good news.<eos> I got Aditi's visa extended another three months.<eos> And I'm filing to get her a green card under the "family preference" category.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> Did you know that Malala Yousafzai is giving a speech at Harvard this week?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Like he was paralyzed.<eos> I think I know what she is.<eos> Do you care to enlighten the rest of us?<eos> Because this doesn't look too good.<eos> It wasn't a werewolf.<eos> Kanima.<eos> Hey, Deaton, how the hell did she get through the Mountain Ash?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a barrier no supernatural creature should be able to cross.<eos> Scott did it.
(Rehab) I had to go to therapy in all five detox centers I've been to.<eos> (Bam Bam) Was it beneficial?<eos> (Rehab) You just heard me say five, right?<eos> See, this is what I'm saying, guys; it's not gonna work.<eos> (Gigi) Hey, Dad, Dad, we are doing this whether you like it or not.<eos> - Yeah, what harm could it do?<eos> - What harm could it do?<eos> Did you see the Metallica documentary where they had that life enhancement coach, and it almost destroyed the band?<eos> (Bam Bam) Yeah, but it didn't.
- What's up, Cat? Oh.<eos> Huh? Look at us.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All back together.<eos> - One big happy family.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> What...<eos> I come to see my little girl in the big city, huh?<eos> Holy shit, you got a tattoo there.<eos> - Yes, she did.
- Yes, she did.<eos> - Oh, that's for him.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Where's mine?<eos> I should have gotten one for you; he hates his.<eos> Oh, why?<eos> Do you hate the color?<eos> He doesn't like commitment.<eos> Do you not have Gigi's name on you?<eos> No, no, actually, he doesn't.
How does she look?<eos> - Pow.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Look at the detail.<eos> It's just like the old ax.<eos> I know;<eos> I was trying to make an impression.<eos> Well, you would have.<eos> You did just now.
I don't know how far things are gonna go.<eos> I'm just following how I feel right now.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I'm not old and worn out and filled with all this hard-fought wisdom that I got from fucking up my career and my band and drinking and drugging my band into oblivion.<eos> All right, well, listen.<eos> There's... there's nothing I can do about the past, but you know, I can do something about right now, so I'm just making a promise to you.<eos> And I'm gonna try and fix the stuff that's wrong with me, and then maybe I can help fix you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> You just quoted Coldplay.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I just need more time.<eos> I need a little bit more time to feel safe because I want to make sure it's gonna last.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got it.<eos> I am going to get a tattoo, though, and I picked it out, and I want to see if you like it.<eos> It's flaming dice.<eos> You said that was cool, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- I go down on a guy...<eos> - I don't want...<eos> I said...<eos> I changed the words!<eos> I go down on a guy I like to decide whether or not I want to sleep with him.<eos> Like, I'll do it, like, two or three times to keep him interested, and, you know...<eos> It's my system.<eos> Okay... you have a system?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> Every girl does.
Flora.<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> She was never out of our sight.<eos> And besides, she was terrified of him.<eos> I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
Are you listening to my breakup mix?<eos> Since you're my best man, I wanted you to be the first to know...<eos> She left me, Junior.<eos> The wedding's been called off.<eos> Linda left me.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Zoe, we're gonna have to reschedule the bread.<eos> Yeah, Senior was so broken up over Linda, he forgot his cell phone at home.<eos> So he didn't tell Tony he was coming?<eos> No, he did not.
Hacking the FBI firewall is too black hat for me.<eos> I'm worried I set off an alarm just sniffing around the outside.<eos> See?<eos> I told you this was a waste of time.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This still helps, ok?<eos> We just need to find someone who can hack into the FBI.<eos> Do you know anyone who does that?<eos> Because I sure as hell don't.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yeah, not exactly like...<eos> But, yeah, once or twice.<eos> So you've had to deal with people who are scared.<eos> What do you say to them?<eos> I'm asking what I should say to you.<eos> That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Ah, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> The dark.<eos> The sword.<eos> The forsaken.<eos> The temple.<eos> When we found out what the ghosts were saying, we weren't surprised because the words, they were already inside us.<eos> But you, you were, weren't you?<eos> You didn't know what the words were going to be.<eos> No, I didn't.
Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too.<eos> People you went to school with, previous addresses or how to drink liquids.<eos> That's you two done.<eos> Where's Bennett?<eos> What will happen to them?<eos> UNIT will cut out the Faraday Cage with them inside and take it away.<eos> Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Let's do it.<eos> You can take our Saturday morning, but you'll hopefully never take away our mid-to-late Saturday afternoon!<eos> Let the ultimate challenge begin.<eos> The fashionista versus the detentionistas.<eos> I can't believe I have to work with Tina.<eos> She smells like failure, and her hair smells like ketchup.<eos> It's not like I want to work with you, either, Tammy.<eos> And you're wrong.<eos> My hair doesn't smell like ketchup.<eos> My skin does.
Kids, the tailored fit around the wrists of my lettuce suit was impeccable!<eos> We can easily change it to peccable if you prefer.<eos> But there was a clear winner.<eos> The kids!<eos> (cheering, excited chatter) What?<eos> ! Mr. Branca, there must be some mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Did Tina and Tammy give up their bracelets to secure your sleeves?<eos> Did you... collaborate on fashion and build a bridge to friendship and understanding?<eos> We sure did, Mr. Frond.
I'm hiding out in here from Cooper and life.<eos> Yeah, I'm... What's wrong, baby?<eos> Well, I have a dilemma.<eos> Cooper moved in upstairs and now I'm starting to feel things for Josh downstairs.<eos> Oh my damn.<eos> Go on.<eos> Josh told me that he loved me.<eos> And I didn't think that I had any feelings for him, but it turns out, I do.<eos> And so I talked to Alan, and he said the only way to find out if those feelings are real, is to kiss him.<eos> And so I did.
Oh, may I ask what amazing dish the maestro is preparing?<eos> - Eggs. - Oh.<eos> Well, listen, I know my sauce went plop-plop when it should have gone whoosh.<eos> And I don't expect you to change your mind, but I couldn't live with myself knowing I didn't do my best work.<eos> So, may I now present...<eos> Filet de boeuf forestiere with Bordelaise sauce and petit gratin dauphinois.<eos> Whoosh.<eos> I hope this cow was slaughtered more humanely than you just slaughtered the French language.<eos> Oh, it's French!<eos> Well done.
Allow me to introduce myself.<eos> My name is Agent Peter Smiley and this is my colleague, Special Agent...<eos> Walker. Johnny Walker.<eos> We're deep undercover on direct orders of Queen Elizabeth herself.<eos> Her Majesty was recently the victim of a robbery, and we believe the stolen goods have found their way here.<eos> ~ Blimey!<eos> ~ Blimey ain't the half of it.<eos> I suggest you get on to your police friends ASAP and tell them it's a false alarm.<eos> Unless, of course, you want the Queen on your back.<eos> You don't.
What you say to Senor Juan?<eos> ~ Nothing.<eos> ~ How dare you not speak to Senor Big's client like this?<eos> You are fired.<eos> Go. You go, go.<eos> 'And then I say some things I'm not completely proud of.'<eos> Hey, no offence, OK, but why don't the two of you go and...?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> An hour later, Elton Juan was pushed from the balcony onto his head and they think I was humiliated and wanted revenge.<eos> ~ And did you?
What separate account?<eos> Uh...<eos> I only use it to pay for my separate phone.<eos> You have a separate phone?<eos> Um... um... uh...<eos> Up, down, up, down.<eos> Up, down... up, down.<eos> Good!<eos> You feel the burning in your core?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Ven-ue!<eos> Ven-ue!<eos> Ven-ue!<eos> Venue...<eos> Venue!<eos> Hey, you want to fire a confetti gun, Homer?<eos> That's the only kind of gun I've never fired.<eos> Come on, just point and squeeze.<eos> I know that guy.<eos> Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.
Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.<eos> No, he works at the plant with me.<eos> Homer something.<eos> ♪ When we harmonize ♪<eos> ♪ And you look in our eyes ♪<eos> ♪ You'll see it's no surprise ♪<eos> ♪ That we're your Nobel Prize ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause, girl, you know it's true ♪<eos> ♪ All four of us love you ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah, we do, yeah, we do, yeah, we do ♪

And you have cancer.<eos> Next time you see a rest stop, we need to pull over.<eos> There goes that tiny bladder.<eos> They have vending machines where you did time?<eos> Mm. We had a woman named Mike.<eos> She got you anything you wanted, but you had to let her do stuff that made her feel like her name was Mike.<eos> I'll never forget my first night.<eos> I was scared to death.<eos> How long before you settled in?<eos> Never did.
I thought I hit bottom when I got sent to prison, but turns out, I wasn't even close.<eos> After those cold steel gates slammed shut behind me, I was so lonely and hopeless,<eos> I decided I might as well start drinking again.<eos> I felt like that at rehab when they took away my iPad.<eos> Now... for those of you who haven't been to prison, you pretty much have two choices when it comes to getting loaded:<eos> Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
See?<eos> This is pretty cool, huh?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> But what we could really use is some weed.<eos> I think that might be over the line.<eos> See?<eos> I told you this guy wasn't cool.<eos> Well, now, now, hold on a minute...<eos> Mr. Griffin, did you or did you not distribute alcohol and marijuana to minors?<eos> No, Your Honor, I did not.
Espo, what happened?<eos> I twisted my knee when I was tackling lightning.<eos> Wh... are you gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> I just, uh... I just tweaked it.<eos> It's probably a sprain.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> I was looking forward to beating you in the talent competition.<eos> Oh. You think this is gonna take me out?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Oh, don't think like that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need my partner to have a positive attitude.<eos> Yeah, then maybe you should have checked with your partner before signing her up for this.<eos> Oh, what's the big deal?<eos> It'll be fun!<eos> Castle, did you see those knuckleheads?<eos> I mean, what if I want to be a captain one day of my own precinct?<eos> I kind of need people to take me seriously.<eos> Oh, they do.
I've known the McCawleys a long time.<eos> Rafe, he was my first friend here in Defiance. And I used to baby-sit Christie.<eos> But we can't make this about them.<eos> Appreciate the advice.<eos> I need you to get intel.<eos> All right? Troop movements, personnel counts, armament details. And then I need you to get your ass back here.<eos> In one piece.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I don't have to tell you we're walking into a nest of stone-cold killers.<eos> So don't.
Yes.<eos> Straights against lesbians, get on that.<eos> - Is that your wanking hand?<eos> - It is, yeah.<eos> - It's really strong.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> BOTTLES CLINK<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah!<eos> Do it!
Straights against lesbians, get on that.<eos> - Is that your wanking hand?<eos> - It is, yeah.<eos> - It's really strong.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> BOTTLES CLINK<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
Yeah, we'd have met there, wouldn't we?<eos> You tell us where and we'll come back, bring rescue.<eos> - It's local, innit?<eos> - But where?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Do you not...<eos> - Do you not know where you're going?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just it's...<eos> - No, we don't, Flip.
You're a detective?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't look like they do on TV.<eos> What's... what do they look like on TV?<eos> Like suits?<eos> You know, professional?<eos> Yeah, well, I learned a long time ago that wearing a suit doesn't make you professional.<eos> I also learned that wearing a suicide vest doesn't necessarily make you a terrorist.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because of what I did?
Hey.<eos> Hey. What's going on?<eos> At some point here... you're gonna have to do the right thing.<eos> What do you mean, right thing?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You're gonna have to figure it out yourself.<eos> Walinski, get back out here.<eos> You don't want to die today, Charlie, do you?<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause neither do I.
You remember what we talked about?<eos> This is it.<eos> The time to do the right thing.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I said, shoot him!<eos> Charlie...<eos> Don't do it, Charlie.<eos> I love you, Charlie.<eos> You're like my son.<eos> No, he doesn't, Charlie.
Wow.<eos> Hey.<eos> Well, you look like crap on toast.<eos> I just haven't... really been sleeping well.<eos> There's a woman you haven't mentioned?<eos> A woman?<eos> Well, I'm just saying.<eos> You weren't here when I went to bed last night.<eos> You've been running off on your own a lot these past couple weeks.<eos> I do that.
Hey.<eos> Well, you look like crap on toast.<eos> I just haven't... really been sleeping well.<eos> There's a woman you haven't mentioned?<eos> A woman?<eos> Well, I'm just saying.<eos> You weren't here when I went to bed last night.<eos> You've been running off on your own a lot these past couple weeks.<eos> I do that.<eos> You actually don't.
We're not gonna be working in the bunker, so...<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> What is this about, again?<eos> You were kind of... vague.<eos> Okay, so, here's the thing... Dean is not getting any better.<eos> I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a codex which is sort of a-a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools, and it should help crack "The Book of the Damned."<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.
We all are.<eos> Poor Dean.<eos> Let's just have a nice wee cup of tea... and negotiate.<eos> [ Gun uncocks ] What do you want?<eos> [ Chuckling ] Oh, well, we know what I wanted.<eos> Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we?<eos> Let's talk about what I'll take -- my freedom guaranteed and the codex.<eos> Sam, you can't be --<eos> Do you know which spell?<eos> I do.
There you go, genius.<eos> It's the fire you started in the third ward last night.<eos> Man, I didn't start no fire there last night.<eos> What?<eos> Were you out of town?<eos> Your cat get sick?<eos> Well, let me guess.<eos> You don't start fires anymore.<eos> You been rehabilitated.<eos> Yeah, I done it before.
I haven't seen that you in a very long time.<eos> A lot's changed, Iris.<eos> Yeah, it sure has.<eos> You have learned how to not trust people.<eos> What is it about Jay that you don't like?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's because he reminds you of Harrison Wells.<eos> I trusted that man.<eos> For months.<eos> We all did.
That's the only truth you need to know.<eos> Well, a jury may feel differently.<eos> And something tells me we're about to find out.<eos> We're done.<eos> I'll issue my ruling in the morning.<eos> Die Entrechteten.<eos> Really, Aram.<eos> These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.<eos> The FBI must have some kind of file.<eos> No. We do.
They're drug dealers?<eos> Among the most ruthless in Europe.<eos> Somewhere along the line, they realized that keeping German neighborhoods white is more than politics.<eos> It's economics.<eos> These guys are fighting a street war.<eos> Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> You're telling me that Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade, is walking into that?<eos> How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
I want the surgery!<eos> Dr. Karev is gonna drain the fluid,<eos> - and you're gonna feel better.<eos> - No! I won't!<eos> I can't keep doing this.<eos> I want the surgery.<eos> It's really risky.<eos> Your body's very weak.<eos> - You don't know what you're saying.<eos> - Yes, I do!
- No, you're mad at Derek.<eos> You want to take it out on me, go on.<eos> You want to yell and hit and scream 'cause things are hard at home, okay.<eos> You want to be a mess, be a mess.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can take it.<eos> But in that O.R...<eos> You are not a mess in that O.R.<eos> You tried.<eos> We both did.
- Mom?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Remember that potluck we did a couple years ago?<eos> - With all the guys in your backyard?<eos> When we get out of here, we got to do that again, okay?<eos> But bigger, more people.<eos> We'll invite these doctors. Everybody loved it. Okay.<eos> Sure, honey.<eos> We were gonna make it an annual thing, remember?<eos> We never did.
- That Julie.<eos> She was just right here, wasn't she?<eos> Julie?<eos> - Hey, don't worry. We'll find her.<eos> - We'll find her, ma'am.<eos> I know this is a difficult time and it's the last thing you'd want to think about, but you do have a decision to make.<eos> Do you know if your sons would have considered becoming organ donors?<eos> They were always helping people, even as little boys.<eos> That's why they wanted to be policemen.<eos> Well, Brett did.
And this would have been it for Jared.<eos> And Brett would have been here to help.<eos> So, Derek's back.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - No, it's just... And I'm glad, I am, for you and the kids, and I don't want to make this all about me.<eos> It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.

Hi.'<eos> Just ringing to check you got my email.<eos> I did, yes.
If the police see those photos, it's not gonna be good for him.<eos> Probably not, no.<eos> So what's the minimum term for murder?<eos> A mandatory life sentence.<eos> In a case like this, he'd serve at least 15 years.<eos> So he'd not get out until he was in his 80s?<eos> If in fact he...<eos> In fact, he might not even make it that far.<eos> - It would effectively widow Mum.<eos> - Except, what if he did it?
Yes, I pressed her. Of course I did. Repeatedly for specific detail.<eos> She actually said she saw him digging a hole in the copse in the middle of the night, then he got something...<eos> - stuck it down there.<eos> - Something?<eos> Probably a carpet.<eos> - You think she's sane?<eos> - According to you mate, she's fine.<eos> A little forgetful, but, other than that, fine.<eos> She actually said that she thought it was a body?<eos> Yes. Yes, she did.
- Take him down the Feathers?<eos> - Not the Feathers.<eos> - They still have pole dancers?<eos> - They're mainly Bulgarian now.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> - I meant a nice chat over a pint somewhere quiet.<eos> Not with naked women showing you their insides.<eos> You don't want a heart attack on your conscience, do you?<eos> It's a misconception that plastic doesn't degrade.<eos> It does, but not through bacteria. Through light.
You said it.<eos> He's yanking our chain.<eos> Having a bit of fun.<eos> He's had all this... this power for the last 40 years, this secret only he's known.<eos> And now, now it's all gone. Now all he's got to look forward to is dying in some pissy prison cell with East End Arthur to hold his hand.<eos> I just...<eos> Last night, after we charged him, I sat in my office and I...<eos> Oh, I dunno.<eos> It just felt wrong.<eos> Of course it did.
But not everyone is so fortunate.<eos> And that's why we've donated money so the museum can build a completely new wing.<eos> But while we wait - - I'm sharing art from my private collection, so it can create more joy and maybe get them to continue in the world of art<eos> - and therefore life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Freddie Holst.<eos> - Jeanette, do you regret doing this?<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - No. Not if you don't.
Claes.<eos> So it was you.<eos> Sorry. I have to take this.<eos> I was just congratulating Freddie on all of it. The belly and the exhibition...<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's very beautiful.<eos> But I knew that already, since I owned a lot of the works.<eos> Colbert. Colbert. Just do what we've agreed.<eos> - You seem to have it good.<eos> - I do.
- You seem to have it good.<eos> - I do.<eos> Are you Claes Sandberg?<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Maybe.<eos> If they also have symbols in their mouths, there's only one symbol left in the code.<eos> It could suggest that there's only one victim left.<eos> I'm thinking Freddie Holst.<eos> Why point to Holst if he's the next victim?<eos> I don't know.<eos> To scare him, maybe.<eos> I didn't see Alice and the girls this morning.<eos> - Should you have?<eos> - I usually do.
Why are we talking about this?<eos> I want you to think about your future.<eos> What your life's gonna look like when all this is over.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How long do you think you're gonna fight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stay healthy, 10, 15 years, maybe.<eos> Pfft! 10 years, you're... You're a miracle.<eos> 15 years, that's... forget it.<eos> You did it.
A paper airplane?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Talk about amateur hour.<eos> His parents are probably driving him to prom.<eos> All promposals are amateur hour.<eos> Promposal?<eos> What idiot made up that word anyway?<eos> I always thought it was you.<eos> Despite being known for my cutting-edge wordplay,<eos> Jenna, no, I did not.
With you ASAP.<eos> Rest of you OK?<eos> I've sustained mild injuries but I'm fine.<eos> Quite lucky, actually.<eos> Such tenderness, such care.<eos> All right, Mac.<eos> I fucked him once, ages ago when we were drunk and we said we'd never speak of it again.<eos> How's that going?<eos> I don't even fancy him.<eos> I don't!
Thank God you're okay!<eos> Christy, get in here.<eos> Oh, you don't want me anywhere near her rib cage right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Bonnie, you have a choice to make.<eos> You can either let us help you get sober, or you can keep drinking and using and end up back in jail, a hospital or an early grave.<eos> Well?<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> I want to get sober again.<eos> - I-I really do.
Just tell me your story from the beginning, way before you were torturing your neighbors.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're a little girl in Mudlick, Missouri.<eos> Just take me through a typical day on the farm.<eos> It's pretty much what you'd expect.<eos> Care to elaborate?<eos> You know.<eos> No. I really...<eos> I really don't.
WOMAN: Number 42!<eos> Right here.<eos> You had to have lunch in Chinatown, didn't you?<eos> It smells so good I could go Godzilla on the whole neighborhood.<eos> But I'm gonna let that go 'cause I like the imagery.<eos> (inhales deeply) Four dollars for all of this.<eos> I mean, even if the chicken is pigeon, you can't beat that price.<eos> Sure you don't want any?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Of course I do.
Really?<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Oh, no occasion.<eos> It was actually the captain's idea.<eos> So he's just handing out days off now?<eos> Guess he was in a good mood.<eos> He said take tomorrow off and the next day and...<eos> Three days, tops.<eos> Mike, I know what's really going on.<eos> You do?
When lions kill, they go for the throat.<eos> It's quick, it's efficient.<eos> But these bodies, Every one of them has the femoral arteries slashed.<eos> These people, they died slow painful deaths.<eos> But it was several lions.<eos> Several.<eos> How would they all...?<eos> Change the way they kill?<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> And yet, they did.
Your hair looks so different.<eos> Well, get used to it, boys.<eos> 'Cause we're single, we're sophisticated.<eos> And we just went to a place to get blow-outs.<eos> What's a blow-out?<eos> You know how it's possible to make your own hair look amazing?<eos> - Uh, I do not.
My parents still ask about you.<eos> Damn, I got to get down to Radiology.<eos> But, hey, let me take you out for a drink sometime.<eos> There's more I want to talk to you about.<eos> About what?<eos> I never...<eos> I never really got to thank your parents.<eos> Never got to thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you just did.
Yeah, why would Lee Henry have a tire iron?<eos> Those days are coming, Dad.<eos> Huh. Anyone hear news on the boy?<eos> The bleed is resolved, but they had to put a shunt in to reduce brain swelling.<eos> Sounds bad.<eos> She said it was a routine procedure.<eos> Uh, hey, Otis.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I don't know if Joe said what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he did.
You're...<eos> Emma.<eos> The mad hag who was locked in the tower.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you out of your chains.<eos> You're the one that's hard to recognize... both of you.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> Tell me... who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love. You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
Fix it.<eos> Write everything the way it was. Without ink, he's not writing anything.<eos> My blood. It was supposed to work last time. Yes, when mixed with darkness, but you're not the savior here.<eos> Because of him.<eos> But that doesn't mean we didn't find one.<eos> And in this world, we don't need a dark savior.<eos> We need a Light One.<eos> Hold on, mom. No, don't! Henry, do it!<eos> Henry?<eos> You did it.

Woodie!<eos> (GROANS) Bastard!<eos> ~ Thank you, Woodie.<eos> ~ Not at all, sir.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to know why? (LAUGHS)<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
No!<eos> No, no.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, no.<eos> I did manage to track where the laptop's been used.<eos> It's inside the FBI.<eos> OK.<eos> We just need to find someone who can hack into the FBI.<eos> Do you know anyone that does that?<eos> Because I sure as hell don't.
Sir?<eos> Something is different from when I was last here.<eos> What?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. Henry, please fetch my camera.<eos> Right away.<eos> You're not a policeman anymore so stop behaving like one.<eos> That man who was killed, he's somehow connected to a woman by the name of Edna Brooks.<eos> - Yes, I know who she is.<eos> - You do?
I walked up to her.<eos> I didn't even notice the blood that I'd stepped in.<eos> He told me that the police would be here soon, and that they'd want to speak to me, and that I had to leave now.<eos> I told her to collect Simon and go to an address that I'd given her where I knew she'd be safe.<eos> And he told me to never try to contact him, no matter what.<eos> You thought George killed your husband.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Do you think that I would have let him take the blame if I didn't?<eos> I loved him.<eos> I still do.
I said if you didn't, I wouldn't.<eos> I didn't say if you did, I would.<eos> They're not the same thing.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Hold on, you didn't let me finish.<eos> I'm not gonna write you another prescription.<eos> I'm gonna give you these.<eos> That's enough for another week.<eos> You want me to come in here again.<eos> Mm, I sure do.
Max, take him off set.<eos> Be professional.<eos> How professional can I be?<eos> She's asking me to fluff his nutter.<eos> Yo, Nash!<eos> Break time.<eos> So...<eos> Marie.<eos> Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?<eos> Of course she did.
And had I not been able to roll myself out to the street,<eos> Nash and his mom will be here any minute, Max.<eos> Do you really need to expose 60% of your boobs?<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> These girls have a life of their own.<eos> The right one just started a Fleetwood Mac cover band.<eos> You know how I know?<eos> 'Cause when I take my bra off, it goes its own way.<eos> Do you really think you can get Nash's mother to change her mind when they come in to pick up the rest of his stuff?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah. I didn't think so.<eos> He killed those girls just as sure as he killed my partner.<eos> Too bad they can't hang him twice.<eos> They didn't tell me you were here.<eos> I came straight from school, just like you asked.<eos> Mom -<eos> You don't have to apologize again.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry. I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.
My father had every reason in the world to do him harm, but he didn't.<eos> I know it.<eos> What do you think happened when your father went to confront him?<eos> Last night, around 9:00, I grabbed the gun I keep hidden behind my bedside table, a box of bullets from the drawer there.<eos> Drove to the home of Dan Hoffman and rang the bell.<eos> When that bastard came to the door, I pointed the gun at his chest and shot him twice.<eos> Maybe three times.<eos> Should have been more.<eos> Should have emptied the entire gun in that son of a bitch.<eos> But I didn't.
Of course.<eos> Huck, we don't need to find any other B613 agents.<eos> We have another witness.<eos> Me.<eos> I saw Jake kill James Novak and Vanessa Chandler and Shelby Moss.<eos> I can testify.<eos> To bring down B613, we need to bring down Command.<eos> Command is Rowan, but Command is also Jake.<eos> - You don't give up, do you?<eos> - No. I don't.
Three bottles of wine.<eos> Okay, but you do remember the dancing?<eos> The singing?<eos> Oh, tell me you remember the singing, because it was amazing.<eos> I sang?<eos> Come on, let's get you into bed.<eos> Oh, go get in bed.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> 48 hours to shut down the case.<eos> And if we don't?
I'm gonna need you to stay right there.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Is that who I think it is?<eos> The mayor's wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right Marcus tell us what happend.<eos> We were here in the bed, and we heard someone come in the back door.<eos> Figured it was her husband.<eos> - You said he went in early.<eos> - He did.
There are rules, regulations, protocols.<eos> You don't just pop onto a U.S. Navy vessel.<eos> Understood, of course.<eos> I was just here picking my client up to bring her back to my office for a meeting.<eos> I don't think that'll be possible.<eos> Ensign Martin is integral to our operation, and she has some duties she's neglecting at the moment.<eos> Back to work.<eos> It's better if he's not too damaged.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
Until she starts to believe he's gone.<eos> And she relaxes.<eos> And then he sends us in.<eos> But she has to know.<eos> That's how he lets her know Papa Pope is in charge.<eos> That's how he lets her know that...<eos> You can't take command, son.<eos> Yes.<eos> She never had a chance, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
Okay, Amy has been restricted to the ship.<eos> For something called "conduct unbecoming." Whatever that means.<eos> According to the uniform code of military justice, that could mean any number of things... making a rude remark, using foul language... Sneezing at the wrong time.<eos> There has to be some way we can get Amy out of there.<eos> What about emergency medical leave?<eos> Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.
I want to destroy his life.<eos> If he had done the right thing, he would've saved my father.<eos> He chose not to, so...<eos> Down he goes.<eos> You scare me.<eos> Good.<eos> You never forget your first.<eos> Kingsly's when we became a team.<eos> Remember?<eos> Of course I do.
- I'm Amanda.<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's nice to see you again.<eos> Sammy.<eos> He's home.<eos> He was a really good friend.<eos> You two belong together.<eos> And deep down, she knows it.<eos> Does she?
G'day, cow.<eos> Someone's in a good mood.<eos> Oh, is she talking to you, girl?<eos> You in a good moooooood?<eos> A little cow humor.<eos> So single life's treating you well?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Breaking up was definitely in... in everybody's best interest, you know?<eos> And I wish Carol all the best.<eos> And she does the same for me.
Former military.<eos> My dad was in the military.<eos> - I did military.<eos> - Phil...<eos> No, but I was military.<eos> - I'm not making that up...<eos> - Go on, new Phil.<eos> Well, after I left the Special Forces, I became a contractor, mostly for Habitat for Humanity, but also to make a buck here and there.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> I-I also did Habitat for Humanity in college.
Great.<eos> Thanks, ladies.<eos> Broken generator.<eos> Nice try.<eos> What's all this?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at this, huh?<eos> You got a class B commercial license to operate this thing?<eos> I do.
- Fantastic.<eos> - Water.<eos> - That's what I've been saying.<eos> That's why I planted my own garden, but it's just not enough.<eos> Uh, thanks a lot, Mr. President.<eos> Or should I say "Mr. Spoiler Alert"?<eos> What are you talking about, Tandy?<eos> My surprise, which this guy just spoil-alerted.<eos> I've made us a farm, a viable, sustainable, working farm.<eos> I did that.

She might meet someone she can't bear to lose.<eos> That happens... .. I believe.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was emotional.<eos> Just possibly, I have made a terrible mistake.<eos> Maybe even a tidal wave.<eos> Time will tell, it always does.<eos> Whatever you did for Ashildr... .. I think she deserved it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
You used mine.<eos> No, please. Michelle.<eos> Back, back!<eos> This whole time, that's what this was about.<eos> You got close to me so you can use me!<eos> No, no.<eos> No, this is real.<eos> Everything about you is real to me.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I do.
Hey, is Gabby here?<eos> She outran me and then texted me she was going to sleep at your place.<eos> Well, she texted me "Slap win at Jerma's"<eos> with some winking emojis, but I got kind of worried.<eos> I haven't seen her since the party. Well, right after the party, when she was running through my yard pantsless.<eos> [bleep]. Okay, thanks.<eos> Hey, while you're here, quick question.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Uh, we used to go out, and...<eos> Oh, my God. We did, didn't we?
Are you [bleep] kidding me?<eos> What?<eos> I thought what we had was simple.<eos> Maybe for you, because you weren't in it.<eos> I for one found the whole thing very dramatic and stressful.<eos> I didn't realize you felt that way.<eos> Because you never really listened to anything I said.<eos> And you took my V-card, and then you could hardly look at me.<eos> - Come on, I liked you.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- Gordon...<eos> - Look, you have no idea what the last year has been like.<eos> I mean, you know, her work's taking off, you know, and it's driving her, you know, like... well, like mine used to, you know?<eos> She's happy, okay?<eos> She's energized.<eos> And she'd stop everything to take care of me and I can't ask her to do that.<eos> Not... not yet, at least.<eos> So, um, if we had to switch back to XTs, how long would that take?<eos> We're not gonna have to do it.<eos> Okay, but just in case we do,
Heard you got rich, so big tip.<eos> What the hell was that about?<eos> - You're asking me? - Yeah.<eos> She lost it.<eos> Now we're dead.<eos> All Donna did was behave like you do every day without bailing you out for it like usual.<eos> - You know, maybe you didn't like it...<eos> - I never because it was like looking in a damn mirror!<eos> People have other things going on in their lives that you don't know about.<eos> And you do, huh?
Sure.<eos> So, what are you saying, you should've done something else?<eos> Stayed here?<eos> Sold tractors off the 5?<eos> You got nothing to complain about.<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, it feels so good to just sit here and do the wrong thing with you.<eos> Well, I don't want to keep you.<eos> I'm sure you got better things to do than sit in the back of a truck and just listen to me babble on.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
"I need you to find a member of the Colton family and bring them back to Haven."<eos> - I'm Hailie Colton.<eos> - Hailie.<eos> - And Charlotte didn't tell you what this controller was or how it worked?<eos> (Nathan): Well, there wasn't time.<eos> She just said we needed to build a new Barn that would end the Troubles.<eos> - And it's in the Void?<eos> - Somewhere in the wreckage of the old Barn.<eos> - Hey, you know that's hot.<eos> - No, I don't.
let's be fair...<eos> I'm a much faster runner.<eos> - Do you usually get morning visitors?<eos> - No.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - Better late than never.<eos> Miss me?<eos> - All the 3s have been played.<eos> - Question is, do you have a heart?<eos> Hm, of course you do.
I'm falling a little behind.<eos> With all these Troubles there's got to be something that can help us. Maybe we can cut the cord.<eos> Free Dave from Croatoan's influence.<eos> - How can I help?<eos> - Start digging-<eos> - Okay, so you're saying that I can phase through air, not just objects?<eos> - If you have this.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> - No crazier than completely forgetting the town that I grew up in, or having a power that lets me walk through walls.<eos> - Your Trouble does something else too.
I told you once before when you held a knife to my throat, I am ready for hell.<eos> But let me say two words before you do...<eos> Mary Sibley.<eos> What about her?<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
What happened to them?<eos> Not witch hunters, but her.<eos> I am not of the old breed, but the new, and I'm not afraid of her.<eos> You perhaps, but what of the boy?<eos> For his safety, I should take him back to the woods.<eos> Fine, just for tonight.<eos> But hurry back, for I have had fair warning, but they shall have none.<eos> You'll damn your soul to hell, my child.<eos> No, no.<eos> You did that.
You ain't got no business marching me... I'm an officer of the law.<eos> I ain't done nothing wrong.<eos> Tell them.<eos> Nothing wrong?<eos> A dead body ain't property.<eos> And taking one ain't theft.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> This is theft.<eos> I didn't know that was there.<eos> But you did.
- If he's capable of paying men to disrupt anatomy classes, as I suspect, what else would he be willing to sponsor?<eos> He could have told her about me and asked her to call.<eos> As a spy?<eos> What else did you talk about?<eos> Mainly God, sir.<eos> And her brother, Lord Hervey.<eos> What about him?<eos> How his work is under threat by the Anatomy Act.<eos> Does that not raise your suspicions even more?<eos> Yes, sir, it does.
Yes, yes, you are.<eos> You're doing that thing that you do when you say it without actually saying it.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> It this about Sam?<eos> Because Sam is not alone. He's got his kid, right?<eos> Okay, so maybe he feels like he's alone because he's new in town, but maybe, just maybe, that's by choice.<eos> Because people from the big city, they're like that.<eos> They just like to be by themselves, right?<eos> - No one chooses to be alone.<eos> - Hermits do.
What... wait, really?<eos> I feel some scar tissue.<eos> - You may have plantar fasciitis.<eos> - Oh dear!<eos> Oh, it's nothing serious, but any pressure to your foot can cause a flare up.<eos> Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> Uh, I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> - Oh, I do.
The ad agency in New York?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't need to.<eos> Right.<eos> You had a feeling.<eos> I did and I do, all the time.<eos> Well, I had so much vacation time they insisted I use some.<eos> Did they?<eos> - They did.
Her job is to push the limits and my job is to enforce them.<eos> But if you become just an enforcer, she's just gonna keep pulling away.<eos> My advice: loosen your grip a little bit.<eos> I can't.<eos> - No, you just don't want to.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Because I'm the only one left with a grip on her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died.<eos> You do?
Are you all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Here, let me take a look.<eos> No, go.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to make you late for your date.<eos> My X-ray is down, but to be safe I need to get a better look.<eos> You did say you fractured that ankle once before, so this joint is at least susceptible.<eos> If you insist.<eos> - I do.
It's October 14th.<eos> We go to remember.<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> John, open it.<eos> Open it or I will.<eos> It's my birthday present and I'll open it when I'm ready.<eos> Wait!<eos> What-- what is it?<eos> She found it.<eos> No, she didn't.
Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> October 14th.<eos> Four years ago.<eos> Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we didn't.
Four years ago.<eos> Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we didn't.<eos> No.<eos> Not until the phones started ringing.<eos> Till we turned on our televisions.<eos> And we ran out onto the streets.<eos> Found each other.<eos> Yes, we did.
Yes, you love your family.<eos> It's not your time.<eos> Still got so much to live for.<eos> Oh, come on, be original, mate.<eos> Why should you go back and the rest of us--<eos> Because I deserve to.<eos> You deserve to?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now tell me how.<eos> I already did.
Violent hands.<eos> I want you violent at the point of attack.<eos> You need a nap, Charles? We got time.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Here we go, I'm ready.<eos> Quit holding.<eos> You're clicking your heels, Greane. Widen your stance. Kick, slide.<eos> Kick, slide. Basics. Come on, man.<eos> Didn't you win a fucking Super Bowl, Greane?<eos> - Yes, I did.
This is St. Nicholas we're talking about?<eos> As in Kris Kringle?<eos> He means something more in Orthodox tradition.<eos> He's the one you turn to in cases of calamity, when things have turned against you.<eos> It's just an observation, but he seemed like a different person, like he was afraid, even.<eos> Afraid of what?<eos> I don't know, but I've been around enough true believers to know when they're really praying, and Ostrov was.<eos> The guy that took me hunting this afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way.<eos> Could something have happened to change that?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, something did.
We tell the Russians we're going down to get those men out, they will refuse.<eos> And they're close enough now to send out a missile of their own, and destroy it themselves before we'll get a chance to touch it.<eos> So, no good options.<eos> Ostrov will never admit failure, concede that one of his crews mutinied.<eos> Not in public.<eos> There may be a way to resolve this.<eos> A deal that even he can live with.<eos> But we're gonna need to go through back channels.<eos> And we happen to have one.<eos> We do.
Could be two devices.<eos> Could be two triggers.<eos> You know this stuff!<eos> Heading for the daft twat box, you are.<eos> Get out, reboot and fucking come back in again.<eos> You too, eh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got to clear my head.<eos> Just don't know what's up with me.<eos> I do.
- Okay.<eos> And when it's bad, it hurts so much.<eos> Hey, can we talk?<eos> Uh, actually, I was just...<eos> What's really going on?<eos> I need you to tell me, 'cause...<eos> You say one thing, and I think you mean something else entirely, and I want to understand.<eos> I am trying to.<eos> Because I want what we started here.<eos> I do.
- Uh, did a loop around Pennfeld.<eos> Lighthouse?<eos> That's like three miles.<eos> Helps me focus when I'm dealing with a lot of things.<eos> Three miles is a lot of things.<eos> Given what went down with us, you don't think maybe we need to talk about it?<eos> Look, Ben, you don't know what I've been through,<eos> - what I'm going through.<eos> - You're right.<eos> I don't.
I told her how I felt.<eos> She made it clear she didn't want to be with me.<eos> Look, it's time I faced reality.<eos> She never wanted me to be a part of this, anyway.<eos> Only because she was protecting you.<eos> She loves you, Jack.<eos> I can't hear that right now.<eos> And I certainly didn't hear it from her.<eos> We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels are two very different things.<eos> Yes, we do.
I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I had some calls I had to make.<eos> You okay?<eos> 'Cause to be honest, you got me and the squints kind of worried here.<eos> Why?<eos> Did Bones call you or something?<eos> No, we're just all concerned because for some crazy reason we care about you.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should be more concerned that we don't have a motive or a suspect.<eos> Well, we do now.
I don't want to know what Ric's doing, do I?<eos> Probably at the movies.<eos> Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> And I quote-- "She stared at me like I was an alien and then basically teleported out of the room."<eos> Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again.<eos> Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
It's in the northwest somewhere.<eos> I mean, I'd tell you where it was, but you made it abundantly clear you didn't want to know.<eos> Heh heh.<eos> I'm gonna check out upstairs.<eos> I'm on my third glass, so speak slowly.<eos> You know how you and I were both worried that he didn't think this through?<eos> He thought it through.<eos> Ha!<eos> It's Damon.<eos> He didn't.
Barbie!<eos> Enough!<eos> Dale!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> Yeah. We do.
- Uh, just... think about it.<eos> And... do you think you could find your nephew?<eos> I didn't see him here.<eos> She called you "Dale."<eos> Julia, I said I don't want to talk about it.<eos> The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here, in the flesh.<eos> Of course I have questions.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Yeah, to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away and to kill her if she ever becomes one of them herself.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Okay?<eos> Screw you for ruining a perfect day.<eos> I love you.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
Nothing is going to happen to you or this baby.<eos> Understand me?<eos> You leave Julia to me.<eos> I still can't figure it out.<eos> Happy to report all the bees are back in Christine's bonnet.<eos> Just don't get too comfy.<eos> Eventually, we're gonna have to move again.<eos> We're at war.<eos> - You said we'd be safe here.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
This is Harriet, your midwife.<eos> Why would I need a midwife?<eos> I only found out I was pregnant today.<eos> Eva, I told you, this isn't any ordinary pregnancy.<eos> Your baby will be here before you know it.<eos> Now I need you to pack some things.<eos> We're going somewhere your baby will receive the special care she deserves.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until Dale's back.<eos> But don't you want what's best for your baby?<eos> Of course I do.
But I understand why you need to.<eos> I respect it.<eos> You're gonna be a great father.<eos> The baby...<eos> I just wanted that to be us.<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Julia, I am with you.<eos> And you need to trust me.<eos> I do.
Easy.<eos> Here.<eos> What the hell were you thinking, sneaking off like that?<eos> You're not my dad.<eos> I can do what I want.<eos> Oh, sass?<eos> Now we get sass?<eos> Look, your actions affect all of us.<eos> You could've led those freaks straight here to us.<eos> Which she didn't, okay?
Nah, keep it.<eos> I got plenty.<eos> Something else?<eos> What did it feel like... when you first killed somebody?<eos> It gets easier the more you do it.<eos> As far as I recall, I never bagged anyone who didn't bear some responsibility for the getting killed part.<eos> Why?<eos> You feeling guilty?<eos> Well, that's the thing.<eos> I don't.
Barbie, they are gonna have her hidden, under heavy guard.<eos> - This is their new queen.<eos> - That's ridiculous!<eos> She's a baby!<eos> She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She is my daughter.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
To kill everyone infected with the Life Force.<eos> You don't know what you heard.<eos> You talk to anyone else?<eos> I will if you don't help me stop Hektor.<eos> You obviously don't know who you're talking to.<eos> I worked surveillance on the dome.<eos> I've seen you go all Ted Bundy on people.<eos> I also saw how much you care about this town.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> And neither does Hektor.
Joe is innocent.<eos> Everyone under this dome is innocent.<eos> Believe me, what I have to do, it... it breaks my heart.<eos> That couldn't have been my daughter.<eos> She's less than a day old.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think you're lying.<eos> If you really were human, you'd remember everything you did while you were infected.<eos> I do.
I just wanted to help.<eos> And you can do that by helping Sam take the children back to Town Hall.<eos> Come here, sweetie.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> You are not our queen.<eos> - Run!<eos> - You're human.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.<eos> That little girl almost drowned right in front of me.<eos> But she didn't.
Just like that.<eos> How do we know the two of you aren't Life Forcing it up?<eos> I was never cocooned.<eos> I'm human, remember?<eos> I wouldn't have brought Christine here if I thought she was dangerous.<eos> If I wasn't certain she was one of us now.<eos> She's here to help us find my daughter.<eos> Is Dr. Bloom still working on the umbilical cord?<eos> When Hektor went after Joe, it wasn't just me who tried to stop him.<eos> Dr. Bloom did, too.
She didn't show any of the usual signs.<eos> Oh, Louise.<eos> It's normal to look for answers at a time like this.<eos> But we read her note.<eos> She was resolute in her decision.<eos> Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
Your snoring woke me up.<eos> I don't snore anymore.<eos> You know, in D.C., I could hear the Metro station from my apartment.<eos> The trains would wake me up every morning.<eos> This is a much better way to wake up.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Your snoring is like a train.<eos> It's much cuter.<eos> I don't snore.<eos> Yes, you do.
♪ But can't we just be about it?<eos> ♪ ♪ Show me what you gonna do about it. ♪<eos> (chuckles) Damn, you ain't playing no games.<eos> So, do I have the job?<eos> I'm trying to keep it at three, but we got three girls we like, you know?<eos> You definitely a contender.<eos> What do you mean "three"?<eos> Three girl group.<eos> On Instagram, it didn't say anything about a girl group.<eos> Yeah, it did.
You need to get out!<eos> Good luck.<eos> An all-Latina girl group, that could be huge, man.<eos> I'm not interested in being a part of a group. HAKEEM:<eos> Shecrazy.<eos> Iloveher.<eos> My heart is not in this, Mom.<eos> Empire's in my blood.<eos> I'm praying that you'll forgive me.<eos> I don't.
You know, it's easy to lose yourself in all of this and-and running Empire.<eos> But this is home.<eos> Doing this, this is what I do.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> Sir, uh, I'm sorry to bother you, but we have a serious situation here.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> FBI.<eos> We have a warrant.<eos> Your warrant does not give you the right to ransack my father's office.<eos> In fact, it does.
Why y'all looked shocked? !<eos> This family never been a real family.<eos> I'm out of here and I ain't never coming back.<eos> Okay, if I give you what you need, you got to let me out of here right now.<eos> I cannot miss another night with my sons.<eos> I missed too many.<eos> If it's good, Cookie, honey, you can leave right away.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know if Lucious shot or killed Bunkie.<eos> (gasps) I really don't.
What's there to talk about? He tried to sell out Dad, it didn't work, and he took the easy way out.<eos> Whatever happened between him and Dad doesn't negate the fact that he always wanted what's best for us, Jamal.<eos> He taught me that it was my responsibility, as the oldest, to always look out for you guys, to protect you.<eos> Instead, I made sure you were at each others throats.<eos> I wanted Empire so bad that I... I was prepared to let you two kill each other so I'd be the only one left.<eos> Come on, Dre.<eos> It wasn't Hakeem that had you robbed at Ghetto Ass Studio, Jamal.<eos> Wait.<eos> When Jamal almost got shot? ! I didn't think it would go as far as it did, okay?<eos> But it did.
So, Laura, take it from the top. Porsha...<eos> The top of what, Cookie?<eos> We already did the intro, the chorus. Hakeem comes in right after.<eos> Right, okay.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> Hakeem Lyon, get your black ass down here.<eos> Well, okay, Miss Thing. Since you already know the choreography, let me see it.<eos> ♪ ♪ Three, four, five, six... Hey, Cookie, you should let me spit Hakeem verse. You know, just to get them into it.<eos> I got skills. No, you don't.<eos> I do. No, you don't.
I am devoting the rest of my life to LGBT people.<eos> And I'm gonna help you, Jamal.<eos> Leverage whatever we have to. Just get me Swiftstream.<eos> I am the O.G. Skye Summers fan.<eos> If I sang my whole truth, my fans would turn on me.<eos> What up? What up? I'm Jason Derulo, live in L.A., big city of dreams, where it's all going down today.<eos> All day long, you're gonna be hearing from some of your favorite music artists giving us the nominees of some of the greatest music acts this year.<eos> So the nominations will be live-streaming on the screens all day long, and every Empire artist has been put on notice.<eos> Everyone that gets a nomination and comes to town will be doing press.<eos> And then Skye does the Empire party.
You'll slip up.<eos> And when you do, you're going to jail.<eos> So you'd better file a few things away in your wank bank, Jasper.<eos> Who is that?<eos> Andy Sinclair.<eos> The Olympic swimmer.<eos> Andy Sinclair won four gold medals in the last Olympics including one of the greatest come-from-behind finishes in sports history.<eos> The guy inspired a Nation.<eos> Does he inspire you?<eos> Well, yes, as a matter of fact, he does.
So, are you safe?<eos> For the moment, yes.<eos> And Redmayne and Castro are satisfied?<eos> Happy days.<eos> So, what did we learn?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> Go slow, choose carefully.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you know Neil Sands?<eos> - Do I... No.
Alex, until we know who this mole is, you have to try to stay strong and...<eos> Hope I'm not arrested.<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay?<eos> A quantum implant?<eos> How the hell did you get it on the computer?<eos> You went into his hotel room?<eos> All above board, sanctioned by headquarters and DOJ.<eos> Why go around me on this?<eos> I didn't.
Special Agent William Brock, with the FBI.<eos> This is Sam Luttrell, he's a civilian working with us.<eos> Sorry to drop by unannounced at this hour.<eos> Do you work with Alex?<eos> That's right.<eos> Did something happen to him?<eos> It's best if we talk inside, ma'am.<eos> Mrs. O'Connor, is it okay if we come in?<eos> Have you spoken to Alex today?<eos> Earlier. My wife did.
Mrs. O'Connor...<eos> Alex trusts us.<eos> Can you help us find him?<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Well, if he does call, and I'm sure he will, have him call us.<eos> Call me.<eos> I'll do everything I can to get him home safe, I promise you.<eos> So you believe that he's alive, then?<eos> Yes, I do.
We put you here, and we can't get you out.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You and Dad did all you could to get out.<eos> You need to get them to remove the cuffs.<eos> They will never do that.<eos> They will, if they believe that you're dying.<eos> Who's that you're talking to, Alex?<eos> Mm? Is that your parents?<eos> Mark and Katya?<eos> What did you do to them?
- One.<eos> Of course.<eos> I can get you for one at Borchardt.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> You don't want to eat there.<eos> Uh, checking out... 708.<eos> The chef's secret weapon is truffle oil.<eos> He bathes everything in it.<eos> - What if I love truffle oil?<eos> - You don't.
Who happens to be within a five-block radius. Dr. Glover, are we... Quite finished?<eos> Please, help me with my jacket.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So...<eos> It's up to you.<eos> (Oskar) I walk out of that door alone... Or nobody does.<eos> You killed the woman carrying your own child, The woman you loved.<eos> Then you know what I am willing to do.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
- Felix, that's not true.<eos> - Amy.<eos> We have to talk about Karma.<eos> She's out of control.<eos> I know, but I don't know what to do, unless you have some tranquilizer darts handy.<eos> Do you?<eos> Oh, wait. I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> Could this night get any worse?<eos> It just did.
He knocked us out right when we got our best lead.<eos> We could cross-reference the name Mr. Scratch against old statements.<eos> We'd have to go to the paper files.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> This unsub's probably already found every kid that made an accusation from back then.<eos> If we don't get back online soon or get a lucky break in this case, we're gonna be looking at more drugged victims and dead bodies.<eos> Ahem. Getting online is gonna be a lot harder than you think.<eos> Whoever engineered this, he did a complete and total network and infrastructure shutdown.<eos> But I thought we had firewalls to protect from this kind of breach.<eos> We totally do.
What we have is a-a pure, transcendent, blueberry-filled...<eos> - Uh, Dillon Kingman's Great Smoky alibi just went up in smoke.<eos> Uh, according to his credit card, he went to the same local gas station twice yesterday.<eos> 2.2 gallons at 7:03 a.m.<eos> Then 15.4 gallons at 9:22 p.m.<eos> What kind of car does he drive?<eos> Uh, Audi A6, 2012.<eos> With a highway to city ratio of four to one, averaged to 29 miles per gallon, which is standard for that make, model, and year, he traveled roughly 450 miles, which assuming one way and back<eos> I want to believe you, Ezra.<eos> I really do.
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.<eos> Detective Jacqueline Rivera, LAPD, Internal Affairs.<eos> The LAPD has decided to open an investigation into you.<eos> You're a big boy, Arkady.<eos> You should know not to play with other people's toys.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Friends. Oh.<eos> Friends don't make friends wake up this early.<eos> These kind of friends do.
But he never said squat about the tree.<eos> It was also in a different frame every time<eos> I was there.<eos> Well, how often was that?<eos> He had a nice pool.<eos> Guys?<eos> I'm gonna find the tree.<eos> So our fearless leader has instructed us to...<eos> Find a tree-- yeah, no, I definitely heard that.<eos> But I did something much better:
He's still there.<eos> What time did he enter the lot?<eos> - An hour ago.<eos> - That gives him plenty of time to take the shot at the mosque and get down there.<eos> I'll call Callen and Sam.<eos> - Good work.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> We got eyes on the van.<eos> All right.<eos> Now so do we.
I recognized him when I saw the news.<eos> He came to see me after what happened to Patrick.<eos> And he questioned you?<eos> I didn't know he was a driver for the company.<eos> He said he was a reporter.<eos> He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
I wasn't sure that some of the decisions I'd made were the right ones.<eos> And we used to talk.<eos> And then one day it just turned into something else.<eos> It turned into the worst mistake of my life.<eos> And one which I've felt ashamed of every day for the last 40 years.<eos> Your wife never found out about it?<eos> No, no.<eos> So, why did it end?<eos> I ended it.<eos> The only decent thing I did.
You were just Joseph Harris's slightly disappointing son, a trust fund baby, a member of the lucky sperm club.<eos> Your daddy wouldn't even give you reins to his company.<eos> And now... you wear the ring that everybody in San Vicente has to kiss.<eos> You think you did that all by yourself?<eos> Is that how you want to rewrite that chapter?<eos> I don't care about any of that.<eos> All I care about's our son.<eos> Yeah, now you care about PJ.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I do.
I won't deny that I'm very impressed with those developments.<eos> Isn't that the whole point of the criminal justice system?<eos> No, the point is keeping violent criminals off the street.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?<eos> Mr. Dennison, I've thought long and hard, and I have consulted with my most trusted advisors, so I do not make this decision lightly, but it is clear to me that the only solution to the current circumstance is for you to be locked up.<eos> You need to spend time with the rapists, murderers, and cop killers that are housed in the San Vicente City Jail.<eos> Now, I can only hope while you are incarcerated that you will use your time wisely, that you will ask relevant questions, gather insights, information from all those around you, even the inmates, and I'm convinced that if you do these things,<eos> that you will learn everything you need to know in order to complete the journey that you are on.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do, but... oh. Oh.
Your tone's braggy, but your words are real sad.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Did he clear you for active duty?<eos> First of all, the doctor was a woman.<eos> There's a such thing as women doctors, Sarge.<eos> I lied for effect.<eos> It was a man.<eos> And he said that I was perfectly fine, except for three cracked ribs and a broken toe, which were right next to two other broken toes.<eos> Did he clear you or not?<eos> He did not.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I was worried about you getting hurt.<eos> No, Charles!<eos> Don't apologize!<eos> We're mad at him!<eos> I had to miss family dinner to drive my ass out here.<eos> Well, no one asked you to do that.<eos> Actually, I did.
- She make up the Ponzi scheme?<eos> The $128 million you stole from your clients to fund your lifestyle...<eos> The ranch, the private jets...<eos> Look, I've told this story a hundred times.<eos> We were sleeping together.<eos> She had access to everything...<eos> My phone, computer, passwords.<eos> If you don't believe me...<eos> We want to believe you.<eos> We do.
Never went to trial, but your lawyers...<eos> You said that they gathered a lot of evidence.<eos> We need to see it.<eos> Hello, Roger.<eos> The Director called for a vote.<eos> - When?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> I've been quietly lobbying on your behalf.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> No, you don't.
You first.<eos> No.<eos> Y-you first.<eos> I went first last time when we tried this.<eos> OK.<eos> ♪ ooh, ooh ♪ I don't know where this is going, but I'd like it to continue.<eos> Ouch. You OK?<eos> They're just a few cuts.<eos> You still wear it.<eos> Of course I do.
This kid's in the gang database.<eos> Darius gifford.<eos> He's with the gangster disciples.<eos> I'm guessing his buddy's in it, too.<eos> It's a long way from home.<eos> I mean, this is vice lord territory.<eos> You got an lka? Yeah. Public housing in the deuce.<eos> (halstead) all right, i'll roll there.<eos> I'll notify the family. Maybe not alone.<eos> Hey, done this before.
Don't look at him.<eos> Don't talk about the past. Don't talk about the future."<eos> - But what if-- - Don't. - But what if he--<eos> - Don't.<eos> - But what if he--<eos> - Don't.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You're right, Sofia.<eos> Man, how did I ever make it in switzerland without you?<eos> You didn't.
- I don't believe you.<eos> - Hey, where's the bathroom?<eos> - Oh, it's just right down the hall.<eos> Oh, I love bathrooms I don't need a quarter to get into.<eos> Hey, is it cool if I hand-wash my shirt in there?<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I'm cool.<eos> Okay, that doesn't prove he's homeless.<eos> Oh, the reason I'm asking is 'cause I live in my car.<eos> Okay, that does.
- No, it wasn't.<eos> You know it wasn't.<eos> - Well, you wanted me to help.<eos> No, I want you to fight.<eos> I want you to convince me this is a loser case.<eos> If you're worried about offending me, don't.<eos> I have a gay nephew, okay?<eos> Love my gay nephew, want him to be happy.<eos> I just don't happen to believe in gay marriage.<eos> You do.
Great.<eos> Well, that was exhausting.<eos> But effective.<eos> I have decided not to fund the baker's appeal.<eos> Good.<eos> I think that's smart.<eos> Not just ideologically but practically.<eos> I think you'd lose.<eos> Do you know what metadata is?<eos> - I do.

Have you seen Howell?<eos> I thought he was still here.<eos> Who?<eos> - Howell...<eos> The guy who works on the computer.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Wiley pulled him out for something.<eos> They're in the conference room together.<eos> Did you not believe me when I told you I loved my nephew?<eos> No, I did.
Here.<eos> Got you this.<eos> It's a bunch of jewels.<eos> Went to a couple different jewel stores.<eos> Dummy.<eos> I don't care about any of this stuff.<eos> Ugh, who cares about materialistic things?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why I wrote you a song.<eos> - You did?
Hey.<eos> Todd, I'm so sorry.<eos> I-I had no idea that thing with Tandy happened.<eos> I just want you to know that I'm here if you ever need to tell me anything.<eos> Like someone's trying to murder you.<eos> Well, I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Hey, Melissa.<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't expect you to say it back, but I'm not gonna pretend that I don't love you.<eos> 'Cause I do.
Yes, uh, I would like Duke minus the six, and, uh, what's the over-under on the UConn game?<eos> Keep going; I'm gonna grab my camera.<eos> You don't get moments like these back.<eos> Before we leave Mudlick, there's just one more stop I want to make.<eos> I told you you should've used the can at the diner.<eos> I did, and you could've at least warned me it was an actual can, but...<eos> This stop is for you, Peggy.<eos> Where the hell are we?<eos> In that house is someone that you have not seen in 50 years who misses you very much.<eos> What did you do?
Let tell you something, Henry. There are a lot of people doing what I do, so that they can recover.<eos> They have the luxury of forgetting - because we refuse to. - No one is forgetting.<eos> - That's not what it feels like.<eos> - ...our marriage and our children. And I am talking about a higher purpose which serves them.<eos> You went off to war when we were newlyweds.<eos> You married a Marine.<eos> - You married a spy.<eos> - With a desk job.<eos> - I'll have a desk in Baghdad.<eos> - Don't do that.
Collin was your middle name.<eos> Now, we're guessing the decision to change it has something to do with you serving 18 months for insider trading?<eos> The name change was aboveboard; I'm not breaking any laws.<eos> My real estate dealings go much more smoothly when my criminal record isn't the first thing people learn about me.<eos> I imagine they would.<eos> Because Louis Eisely was a particularly cutthroat<eos> Wall Street trader.<eos> From the early 2000s.<eos> A man whose downfall, at the height of his career, made his name synonymous with Wall Street greed.<eos> I did my time.
No, I meant what do you think'll happen to me?<eos> Don't know.<eos> It'll probably end up as a clip on YouTube.<eos> Three million hits that pissing boy got, I didn't see a penny of it.<eos> I'm sorry for spoiling your programme.<eos> Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> You were swearing too much anyway.<eos> ~ And that was before you murdered a dwarf.<eos> ~ I didn't murder him.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Uh, donkey.<eos> Donkey?<eos> Mule?<eos> Drug mule?<eos> Da.<eos> What does he have to do with that dead girl?<eos> Marcus Martel?<eos> That's his name?<eos> Da.<eos> Nothing to do with girl.
Autopsy's in back.<eos> Only one way in and out.<eos> Tactical goes in there, it's gonna be a turkey shoot.<eos> And protocol says wait until there's an imminent threat.<eos> Guess those documents fit their bill.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> Is there any chance that the file on his brother's death, the one Martel requested, is on the flash drive that Armstrong smuggled in?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Didn't have any access.<eos> But we do.
Yeah.<eos> And what about what Nathan needed?<eos> Hmm? He goes off and he dies for his country, and they won't tell me nothing about what happened to him.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> The only one who ever believed in me.<eos> Nate.<eos> Little Nate with the... bright eyes and the... crazy smile.<eos> A smile I will never see again.<eos> We understand, Marcus.<eos> You don't.
Looking for some fun?<eos> That works.<eos> You're late!<eos> But before we go anywhere, I need to know you can protect me.<eos> And my family.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people!<eos> You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
Exactly how much overlap are we talking about here?<eos> You said this was ancient history.<eos> It is, but I need to know whether or not I can trust you.<eos> Don't ever say you can't trust me, McGee.<eos> Director.<eos> I have a debriefing at the Pentagon, but I just wanted to thank you both personally.<eos> Thank you, Commander.<eos> You put your men on the line for a thing.<eos> A thing that a lot of people forgot about.<eos> You didn't.
Mutiny.<eos> Tom?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Cameron.<eos> Cameron!<eos> Lev's in the hospital.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> I know my father has this idea of me as some damaged little girl unable to keep a relationship.<eos> I'm not exactly eager to prove him right.<eos> Then don't.
There is no trail.<eos> There's no him anymore.<eos> Let... let me go get him out.<eos> That is not what God wants, Keith.<eos> Maybe you misunderstood the message.<eos> You said just...<eos> You believe I'm anointed, right?<eos> I'm your Solomon.<eos> You believe that?<eos> - I do, but...
He explained everything.<eos> And I will keep my end of the bargain.<eos> You can take this to the meeting with McCauley.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I waited 45 minutes just to see if you'd show up.<eos> Sorry, Crys.<eos> I really tried to make it.<eos> No, you didn't.
As I was saying, get rid of the buck teeth.<eos> Maybe draw some on the side.<eos> Your beard's getting kind of scraggly.<eos> I used to have a longer beard than that in college.<eos> Hippie beard.<eos> I think I know why you're not waking up.<eos> You don't want to talk to me?<eos> You know what I did for you, right?<eos> You do know what I made happen?<eos> I did that for you.
That's why I'm giving you one last chance to save your own life.<eos> Tell the truth, Shelly.<eos> Or you too... will end up a spot on the wall.<eos> Root, are you there?<eos> It's me.<eos> I need your help.<eos> She's alive, Harold.<eos> We wrote her off for dead, but she's alive.<eos> We don't know that, Ms. Groves.<eos> Except we do.
Two hours... three times a week... to shop and run errands.<eos> How bloody stupid do you think I am?<eos> I know it sounds like a long time, but...<eos> rationing slows everything down.<eos> The queues take longer.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> So that means more time chatting with friends.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know what women are like.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I could leave quietly, and he'd give me a glowing reference and let you stay on.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because you'd have caused a huge commotion. We'd have both been sacked, drummed out of the profession for good.<eos> So you left a note and ran?<eos> - I had so little time to decide.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.
I do so hate looking a gift horse in the mouth.<eos> Oh, stop being so bloody English and spit it out.<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> Public sentiment towards the Monarchy is at an all-time low.<eos> If a vote on a referendum is brought to the floor, it will not only pass, I believe it will do so with a huge majority.<eos> And if the House of Lords does try to delay such a bill, there will be rioting in the streets.<eos> Which is why I've taken steps to ensure that if such a bill passes, it won't be with a sweeping majority.<eos> Forgive me, Your Highness, but how on earth can you ensure that?<eos> I believe you know James Holloway.<eos> I do indeed.
Yes, he does.<eos> You take cash?<eos> Beep, beep. Pump the brakes, little lady.<eos> Now, there is a membership fee for One in The Savior, but you don't just get to buy your way in.<eos> You have to be invited.<eos> I see promise, but I'm still on the fence.<eos> Anything we can do to nudge you over, you let us know.<eos> Well, you'll get your chance tomorrow when the Bishop hears you preach.<eos> We have to get permission from the Pisas.<eos> Already did.
He said he had no choice.<eos> Said they had dirt on him.<eos> He had a family.<eos> So did she.<eos> I didn't know he was gonna do that, man, you gotta believe me.<eos> This shit is wrong, man.<eos> Shane was my friend.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> I didn't.
I love you.<eos> I don't think those windows open.<eos> You're not supposed to be in here, you know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I heard after what happened last week they're only letting immediate family in.<eos> Jocelyn got 'em to make an exception for me.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> I mean, after all, you are his best friend.<eos> Hmm. Must have been hard staying friends with him, though, right?<eos> I mean, after what he did to you?<eos> What he did to me?
How much would you have made if PJ decided to sell the business?<eos> It's hard to say when you're talking about dot-com money.<eos> Millions? I mean, at least a million, right?<eos> - Yeah, at least a million.<eos> - Wow. That is a lot of money to lose and still stay friends.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How much money would you pay to have more time with PJ?<eos> Let me ask you something else.<eos> I'm gonna go way back now, but... didn't you and PJ both have a thing for Jocelyn?<eos> You did, right?
I know.<eos> I just want to say... I am so excited for this wonderful opportunity.<eos> I... I just want to learn everything I can from you.<eos> Okay, here's my first little tidbit for you to chew on.<eos> Listen to the phrases you're using in your church flyer.<eos> "Jesus Jam." "Cornerstone Coffee Chat."<eos> Honey, we call this "Christianese."<eos> You don't want folks thinking they got to learn a new language to be born again.<eos> I didn't realize.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Look, look, you were right.<eos> That gun, it is going to protect you.<eos> It's going to protect me too.<eos> From my memory.<eos> You remember?<eos> Not the screams in the dark, not everything breaking, but when we spoke all night until the light came in with the Dominican music from the neighbors.<eos> Kissing in the cab, in the club.<eos> Telling me your dreams about tidal waves over the phone during finals.<eos> Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room with a burning hot pipe.<eos> I do."
All things are possible through Him.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> - He made all this possible. - Mm-hmm.<eos> He brought us to San Vicente, and He pointed us to Pernell Harris.<eos> Now we're ready to join forces with Bishop Bruce.<eos> We are so close to being on TV.<eos> He made all that possible.<eos> We messed it up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Not to use you.<eos> To offer a helping hand to someone in need.<eos> To fill my fucking head with whatever I wanted to hear, just as long as I kept making donations.<eos> All I ever wanted to do was to put you on the path to salvation.<eos> Did you ever stop to think of what would happen by filling my head with all those delusions?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't want to see you again.<eos> Unless it's to tell me that Keith is all right.<eos> I did it all wrong.<eos> From the very beginning, I did it all wrong.
Well, he's not coming to the pour.<eos> Why not?<eos> I guess he found out what happened with Goldstein.<eos> He what?<eos> How?<eos> I guess I told him.<eos> Come on, man, let me get this line straight, bro.<eos> We're gonna need to pour some concrete on the back of your head.<eos> Thought you weren't going to work today.<eos> I didn't.
In what world does that make sense?<eos> In a world where she was having an affair with our son.<eos> That world does not exist.<eos> PJ never even met her.<eos> Crys, I'm right about this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.

I'm so sorry I let you down.<eos> I'm sorry being the first person in our family to graduate college wasn't enough.<eos> Being the first black mayor in this city isn't enough.<eos> After I get my concrete pour tomorrow, I'm gonna be the one pushing buttons and pulling the strings.<eos> I took what I had to take, and I gave what I had to give.<eos> That's what a fucking man is, not someone who leaves his family with a stick in his hand and never comes back.<eos> Ugh! Keith, listen to me.<eos> Please let me talk to you.<eos> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil.<eos> So do stripes on the inward parts of the belly.
You must really like this Alicia girl.<eos> I mean, I feel sorry for her.<eos> She's just a little girl.<eos> She has friends.<eos> I mean, like, real friends.<eos> I mean, maybe you can call it that.<eos> What about us?<eos> I thought we were friends, and then you wait until my husband's stalking people before you tell me anything.<eos> This ain't dirt on the preacher, this is dirt on the girl, and I don't think she deserves to be hurt.<eos> Pernell does?
People lie, Danny.<eos> And they lie well.<eos> Guys who own rooms like that attic... When it comes to sex, they know what they want, how they want it.<eos> The sex is professional.<eos> And he didn't know what he enjoyed.<eos> He'd never found out.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> It doesn't matter what I believe.<eos> But, yes...<eos> I do.
He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.<eos> Runs the length of the plane.<eos> And you looked everywhere?<eos> Well, we didn't pull out all the luggage 'cause there was no sign anyone was down here.<eos> Aah!<eos> There's a snake on the mother-flyin' plane.<eos> You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls we had to ship last week.<eos> Look at this luggage.<eos> Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?<eos> They don't, not usually.
It's her.<eos> Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out<eos> - whatever her plan is. - How?<eos> Go to your seat.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Something very stupid.<eos> She has a gun.<eos> Which is why I want you as far away as possible.<eos> You know I feel the same way about you, right?<eos> I do, I do.
I know you've suffered.<eos> Your children dying...<eos> They would have died anyway.<eos> Human life is fleeting.<eos> People are mayflies, breeding and dying, repeating the same mistakes.<eos> It's boring.<eos> And I'm stuck here.<eos> Abandoned by the one man who should know what eternity feels like.<eos> Who should understand.<eos> I do, now, but...
Oh, epic fail, #awkward.<eos> But we can talk about it at Facepack Friday!<eos> Yay!<eos> Are you up for that now?<eos> When is that again?<eos> And afterwards we can totally do each other's nails in our jammies!<eos> My head is confused!<eos> Right, those are mine!<eos> Sorry, Ma'am, but you did say I could help myself to your stuff!<eos> Yes. I did.
You'd have done the same for me.<eos> 'Do you need a warm-up or..'<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> No, no, it's-it's fine.<eos> It's just, um..<eos> The coffee's great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, maybe some company.<eos> Did I remember to thank you for saving my life?<eos> You did.
- So are you new in town?<eos> - Newish.<eos> Lorenzo is part of Rosewood PD's fresh perspective.<eos> That's me.<eos> I spoke to Spencer this morning.<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah, she seems okay.<eos> You know, physically.<eos> They went through a lot.<eos> We all did.
It's time for you to come back to Brasilia.<eos> I know, the children miss me.<eos> Tell them their father is doing work here, important work.<eos> Let's tell them together.<eos> Come home.<eos> What's going on, Vol?<eos> Why did you ride all the way up here? Why do you think?<eos> Vice Chancellor Voske sent you.<eos> She knows you've gone rogue.<eos> They all do.
- Yeah.<eos> Um, Dad and Nora adopted the baby.<eos> They still calling it Lily?<eos> Yeah, you don't like that?<eos> Who cares what I like?<eos> I care.<eos> I mean, you gave her to us.<eos> Did you tell Dad?<eos> No.<eos> - Jill, did you?
Hello.<eos> - 'Martin?<eos> ' - Louisa?<eos> - 'Hello?<eos> ' Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Louisa?<eos> Louisa?<eos> - I told you to get a new tub. - Huh?<eos> No, you didn't.
Have you been taking any other medication that you haven't told me about?<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You deceived me over a urine test.<eos> What are you trying to hide?<eos> I'm not trying to hide anything, doc.<eos> I was just trying to compete.<eos> What do you mean, compete?<eos> All the young lads looking at me like I was over, finished.<eos> I had to show them. You understand, right?<eos> No, I don't.
There's something not right.<eos> They're taking too long.<eos> Fudge?<eos> - We need to get him on the boat.<eos> - Can't use the lifeboat.<eos> The propeller was down when it landed.<eos> Out of action.<eos> We'll have to take him back on the... fishing boat.<eos> - I told you to drop anchor.<eos> - I did.
Previously on Fear the Walking Dead<eos> That soldier has information.<eos> He knows the whereabouts of my wife. He knows where they have your boy.<eos> Mom, she just got on the truck, Dad.<eos> Because, she... she wants to help people.<eos> I'm gonna require a man with your talents when I make my move.<eos> What move?<eos> I've never seen them turn that fast before.<eos> All those people, 2000 of them.<eos> What did you do?
What you diagnosed as endogenous depression.<eos> It's what killed your relationship.<eos> And you have a child together.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Do you believe me now?<eos> Why don't you tell me.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be abducted.<eos> To be taken against your will.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Well... maybe you do.
Tell Faisel who kidnapped his wife before your wives have no husband.<eos> I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Maybe Faisel can help you remember.<eos> He killed one of my fighters, and he took my wife.<eos> Tell me where this man is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.
You leave.<eos> _<eos> And then after a while, he asked me if I wanted to come in.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> How Kyle was doing.<eos> Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
It'll be like I'm not even there.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There was a...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Oh. It's one of those foam memory ones, you know, that adapts to your contours.<eos> Wow. That's fancy.<eos> Well, you might find Susan sleeping on the floor or on the couch, and if that happens, I would just gently encourage her to come back to bed.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I can do that.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> She gonna talk about it?<eos> Look, I don't want to say something that makes her leave again.<eos> My husband, or my ex-husband Kevin, he thought that I left because of him, too.<eos> Of course he did.
I thought I was dreaming, but she was back.<eos> I said we should go to the hospital, but Mary, she just wanted to talk.<eos> The last thing she remembered was the accident, so I told her everything that happened since.<eos> We talked for hours.<eos> And we cried.<eos> Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.<eos> And when I woke up, she was like this again.<eos> For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.<eos> Maybe they don't believe me.<eos> Maybe you don't.
Well, let me assure all of you, Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and all of the hags over at the Daily Planet are working day and night to get this exclusive.<eos> We need to get it first.<eos> I want a sit down with Supergirl.<eos> A girl to girl.<eos> And I want it by, um, the end of the week.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Not you, Kara.<eos> Do you really think that I don't know what's going on with you?<eos> You do?
If you can prove to us you can handle yourself without getting killed.<eos> What are we doing in here?<eos> When I joined the DEO, I spent 12 hours a day for five straight months in this room.<eos> We need to know that you're prepared for everything you might face out there.<eos> Alex, I can bend steel with my bare hands.<eos> And last week, I kicked Vartox's butt.<eos> I'm ready enough.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
We have to stop her.<eos> I have to be ready for her next time.<eos> Show me how to fight.<eos> Train me to be as good as you.<eos> I'll make you even better.<eos> On Krypton, I remember Aunt Astra and my mother always arguing.<eos> Like sisters do.<eos> And when I asked my mother why they could never get along, she said that it was because Astra didn't have faith in people.<eos> You wanted to know if I have faith in you.<eos> I do.
It's the questions the DSD wants to ask you.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> That man, the agent isn't going to leave you alone.<eos> I wanted you to have it so you could see there's nothing to be scared of.<eos> I'm scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of what?<eos> You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.<eos> She didn't?
No.<eos> Kevin, a few hours ago, you were yelling at me to go home and now we're here.<eos> Is she telling you to do something?<eos> Something you don't want to do?<eos> I'm assuming she's not here right now.<eos> No.<eos> And she wasn't at the gate when you saw me earlier?<eos> No, she...<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> It does?
God be with you.<eos> How do we do this?<eos> You just tell me you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> That should do it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did.
How do we do this?<eos> You just tell me you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> That should do it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did.<eos> That I did.
Hey, take it easy.<eos> Mind your fucking business.<eos> Why are you wet?<eos> There was a girl in the pool.<eos> - She was drowning, so...<eos> - Did you drink any?<eos> - What?<eos> - The water, did you drink any?<eos> - No.<eos> - And don't.
Throughout history assassins have never been motivated by money or revenge.<eos> They're motivated by beliefs.<eos> And their targets embody a belief that enrages their would-be assassins.<eos> Why?<eos> Because secretly, they share that belief.<eos> John Wilkes Booth loved black people.<eos> Hated slavery.<eos> Hated it.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - I did not, Senator.
What is the Ukraine?<eos> The fucking Ukraine.<eos> Patti Levin is our new "Jeopardy" champion.<eos> The next night I won again.<eos> Third night, too.<eos> Fourth night, I... I bombed.<eos> But they let me keep everything before that.<eos> $65,300.<eos> More than I needed to leave him... and start over.<eos> But I didn't.
We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess.<eos> No secrets.<eos> No sins.<eos> As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person.<eos> Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets.<eos> I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
I have to.<eos> One of us does.<eos> One of our leaders wouldn't do it, and then the fire went out, and the possessed came in.<eos> They killed my friends until our leader did what he promised.<eos> Then the fire lit again, and we were safe.<eos> You're afraid God won't return.<eos> So am I.<eos> You've let a false prophet take advantage of your fear.<eos> But I hear God's voice.<eos> We all do.

I don't understand.<eos> They left behind all their gear and guns, and they took this... why?<eos> What's in it?<eos> I don't think it's corn.<eos> Hey, my key...<eos> do you have it?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No one's made it out of there alive.<eos> Orpheus only escaped the underworld because he had a magic lyre.<eos> How did you do it?
Yeah.<eos> A website for serial killers.<eos> Who knew?<eos> You know, a few weeks before my sister died, we went to Virginia Beach for her birthday, just the two of us, and we were laying there and I asked her what she was thinking.<eos> And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would.<eos> You know?<eos> Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
I am simply here for what is mine.<eos> Now I understand that it was yours, but due to the unwritten rules of this life that you chose, it now belongs to me.<eos> So I'm gonna take it.<eos> This is who I am, you understand?<eos> It's what I do.<eos> But thank you for your cooperation.<eos> Adios.<eos> Holy shit, you're back!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did you do?
Oh, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He walked it off.<eos> May we have a word please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is my son-in-law Michael.<eos> Uh, he has something to say to you.<eos> You tell everyone you're a pastor?<eos> But I know what you really are.<eos> You do?
- Oh, it's worse.<eos> How do you have one of the Amphorae?<eos> Where did Rhais get it?<eos> You move again, and I'll open it!<eos> You're an eight-ball.<eos> No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
Only if you let them.<eos> They're bigger than me.<eos> I'd be dead if you hadn't stopped them.<eos> This world is filled with monsters far worse than those boys, Alex.<eos> The blade I gave you...<eos> You must use it.<eos> We can't wait for our fathers to return, Alex.<eos> We must fight our battles on our own.<eos> Dad never taught me how.<eos> Mine did.
Just bring the C-4 to me, and you will never have to be a V-1 again.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, no, I believe you.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> It takes so much to build something in this world, and so little to take it down.<eos> Vega is not gonna fall tonight.<eos> David, we can make sure of that.<eos> We can do this together.<eos> You could've killed me, Claire.<eos> Why didn't you?
- Why?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Huh.<eos> I said it would work, didn't i?<eos> You say a lot of things.<eos> You said you want to heal vega, To make a difference, But you know what i think?<eos> I think what you really want is to be king.<eos> - Zoe-- - no, i see what you're doing.<eos> You manipulated claire and you think you can do<eos> The same to me, and you did.
What kind of intel?<eos> Classified.<eos> I should have said no, but I get the distinct impression that my position in this clinical trial is contingent on doing him favors.<eos> So, do them.<eos> I mean, don't people leak information all the time?<eos> You hear what I said?<eos> He's leveraging my health, my life.<eos> Harold, you're a decent man. The man I fell in love with, and now you're asked to do something indecent.<eos> But if you are telling me that your life depends on whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants, you know my opinion.<eos> I do.
Process normally takes weeks.<eos> Ms. Lin's body was only taken two days ago.<eos> According to Danover Labs, the order was delivered to a Dr. Henry McGlasson.<eos> Now, I dug a little deeper into this guy and contacted the Medical Board.<eos> They did have an address...<eos> 3230 Kettering Drive.<eos> How'd it go with Reddington?<eos> Did he have any insights?<eos> No.<eos> But I did.
I don't know what you said before Reddington brought me in.<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's why Reddington brought you in.<eos> He knows the Director is advancing the time-line.<eos> He knows that the plan is to trigger a series of events that will bring us to the brink of another world war.<eos> I didn't tell him that.<eos> It was Leonard Caul.<eos> Reddington has the Fulcrum, which means he has a blueprint outlining our entire infrastructure.<eos> If you leaked operational details, we're done.<eos> I didn't.
Hello.<eos> Nicole, hi, I'm Jacob's lawyer.<eos> I was just talking to Jacob.<eos> Is he still there?<eos> No, he went out to meet with Greg.<eos> Want me to have him call?<eos> Oh, uh, is Greg his partner?<eos> Yes. Why?<eos> Do you know where they were meeting?<eos> No, I don't.
- Mr. Lester?<eos> I thought I'd just drop by.<eos> My wife says I'm not spontaneous enough, so...<eos> - Actually, Mr. Lester, I'm a bit busy.<eos> - Yes, me, too.<eos> - May I come in?<eos> - Actually, I'm in the midst, Mr. Lester.<eos> Do you need the phone number for Mr. Bishop's new lawyers?<eos> - You know Mr. Bishop's in jail awaiting trial?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- No, no.<eos> I just wanted to introduce myself.<eos> You're Simone...<eos> - Raushenbush.<eos> - Ah, that's your - maiden name?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is that a problem?<eos> - No.<eos> I just think we know your husband.<eos> Yes, you do. Louis Canning.
I didn't want you to have it.<eos> What did it say?<eos> It said good-bye.<eos> Good-bye, Mr. Lester.<eos> Now, your fellow officer stated that Mr. Rickter was a danger to himself and others.<eos> Was that your observation, too?<eos> Officer Tannerman?<eos> I was not in a position to make any observation.<eos> But you saw Mr. Rickter being brought in to Homan Square?<eos> No, I did not.

What kind of a problem? Sad...<eos> Gerald Giraffe feels sad.<eos> The metadata indicates that Detective Prima deleted the e-mail from the Canadian authorities, but he couldn't have.<eos> He was testifying on the stand at the time.<eos> Okay...<eos> So, um, then I thought it was maybe Geneva Pine, but actually she was out of town at a prosecutors convention.<eos> Hey, Dora, you're about to spill juice on the couch.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, what are you trying to say?<eos> Um, I'm saying from what I could ascertain, Detective Prima never deleted the e-mail.<eos> Uh, no one did.
Well, yes and no, because sometimes even the best pollsters get elections dead wrong, isn't that right?<eos> Has it happened?<eos> Yes. During the last presidential election... one of the most heavily covered political events in history... they consistently had Mitt Romney leading Barack Obama.<eos> - They did.<eos> - Even to the last day of the election. Romney plus one... that's what all their models said.<eos> But the actual tally was?<eos> Obama plus four. Their methodology was off; mine wasn't.<eos> That's right, you did get the Prady/Florrick race almost perfect, but weren't there certain precincts that you thought went to Mrs. Florrick but actually went to Prady?<eos> I did not screen for those.<eos> Well, fortunately, we did.
- Well, good.<eos> Then this recount should put things right.<eos> You should have taken my money.<eos> 'Cause now you won't be SA.<eos> You are the chairman of Help America Vote, Mr. Nolan?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines<eos> - in Cook County?<eos> - Yes. And did you find any more of these hacking devices, these "man in the middle" devices?<eos> - I did.
- Forty. 40 devices.<eos> 40 machines compromised.<eos> Even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each, that would be more than enough for Mrs. Florrick - to steal this election.<eos> - That is correct.<eos> So you would advocate for a recount in those precincts?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. Nolan, in your meeting this morning with Mrs. Florrick, did you say that you wouldn't have swung the vote for her because she turned down a bribe that you offered?<eos> - Excuse me? - Shall I repeat the question?<eos> - No, I did not.
Alicia had nothing to do with the the hacking devices.<eos> We know that.<eos> But Mrs. Florrick wasn't the only name on the ballot.<eos> There were other tough races.<eos> Tilden's, for example. Who was in danger of losing his state senate seat.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - If Tilden lost his seat, we would have lost our supermajority in the state senate.<eos> The Republicans would've been able to filibuster.<eos> You see now why we need you to withdraw?<eos> No, I don't.
Call me right back.<eos> It'sAlicia.<eos> Leaveamessage.<eos> Baby, call me back.<eos> Call me back right away.<eos> - Try the house. - Yeah.<eos> There's been a massive spike in the officer-related shootings in the last 48 hours.<eos> Nick, stop, please.<eos> Andpeopleactlikethis doesn't change everything.<eos> It does.
We all will be.<eos> Okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> We need to talk to everyone.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> You got anything I could give her for the pain?<eos> Nothing stronger than aspirin.<eos> Um... uh, the phone's in the kitchen if you need to make that call.<eos> I did.
If we're staying here, you have to take care of Peter.<eos> You can get gas from the truck.<eos> - For what?<eos> - To burn him.<eos> No.<eos> If you burn him, the sickness will not spread.<eos> We don't know how it spreads.<eos> I understand.<eos> You knew this man.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You think Patrick's dead already?<eos> You think he just-- he left and never came home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is she?<eos> Susan.<eos> She's your friend.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - I do.
I mean, all I do all day is pay attention to--<eos> Positive attention.<eos> All right.<eos> How come I feel like I'm being called into your office?<eos> I missed you.<eos> He showed me the video he took from the roof.<eos> Jesus, that kid has got a world-class imagination.<eos> You know that.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> - I did.
And so do I.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> No food or drink shall be consumed until its safety can be confirmed.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe Her Highness is poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
You had close and intimate access to her person.<eos> As was my duty.<eos> What contact did you have with her, in particular?<eos> I served her tea.<eos> - What kind?<eos> Chicory.<eos> It gave her great comfort. Though I was never the one to prepare it.<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Yes, I do.
Interesting.<eos> How much of his money?<eos> All of it.<eos> Holy crap! Mom, are you kidding me?<eos> That guy's worth like $10 billion.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You turned him down, didn't you?<eos> I can't accept his money for something that's a total waste of time.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Wrong. - Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Garcia.<eos> Mr. Garcia, Dr. Tyler.<eos> Glad to see you're doing better.<eos> You ever seen this guy?<eos> We're chatting with Peter Van Owen, world-renowned author, psychic, and medium.<eos> Hello.<eos> So, these spirits, they actually speak to you?<eos> Oh, yes. Yes, they do.
I understand.<eos> No. Actually, I don't. I don't understand.<eos> If you have a chance to save your child, even a small one, you take it.<eos> So, this is about something more than that.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Well, we just feel that... Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe God wanted us to know that she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that... We have to let her go.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does. Not for sure.
- To see Miss Baxter.<eos> Oh, that's her Ladyship.<eos> I must go.<eos> What do the police want with Miss Baxter?<eos> - Makes a nice change.<eos> - Good to know we can joke about it.<eos> Well, it's no joke to Miss Baxter.<eos> - Who spoke to him?<eos> - Sergeant Willis?<eos> - Me, I did.
I've asked Mr Molesley to be with me if I'm allowed.<eos> He's outside.<eos> Oh. Well, of course. If I'm not wanted...<eos> - It's not --<eos> - I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> Go on.<eos> I won't beat about the bush, Miss Baxter.<eos> You'll know who I mean by Mr Peter Coyle.<eos> Yes, I do.
- if that would be easier.<eos> - Very good, m'lord.<eos> - Back to normal at last!<eos> - I've enjoyed my time as butler.<eos> I hope you've learned something from it.<eos> You see, Barrow, Carson is a kind man.<eos> Don't overlook that.<eos> It's why people are loyal to him.<eos> I'll bear it in mind, m'lord.<eos> Do.
He had a sharp pain in his jaw, and his arm was numb.<eos> It's not nothing.<eos> Okay?<eos> These are symptoms of a heart attack.<eos> We did an ECG, chest C.T., blood work, started an I.V.<eos> So far, he seems okay.<eos> Okay, great. Well, let me have a listen.<eos> Oh, no. No, no, no.<eos> No, get away from me with that thing.<eos> Now, Len already did all that.
Here, let me help you with that dressing.<eos> No, no, don't touch it. Don't touch it.<eos> - Oh, stop.<eos> - Don't touch it.<eos> Don't start with me.<eos> Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, Soph.<eos> Hey, great news.<eos> Looks like we found your ghost.<eos> Well, actually, my team did, with the help of a very famous psychic.
I thought you said you don't recognize her.<eos> I don't, but I saw my son reaching out to me.<eos> Ethan saw his mother.<eos> In many of the accounts of the NDEs, people talk about seeing loved ones.<eos> You... you think we could be looking at Ethan's NDE.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Except Ethan didn't have a near-death experience.<eos> When will reached out to me, that's when I came back.<eos> But...<eos> Ethan didn't.
I understand the potential, but this is not the right way to find what you are looking for.<eos> I'm not shutting this down.<eos> Look, I want answers as much as you do.<eos> It's how you knew I would agree to do this in the first place, but I do not want to find out this way.<eos> It's not right.<eos> There may not be another way.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> We will keep looking.<eos> We have time.<eos> Maybe you do.
Sweetie, you scared me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to play a song for Debra.<eos> You know, let's get you back to your room.<eos> You need to rest up for your operation tomorrow.<eos> I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to frighten anyone.<eos> I just stopped by Kyle's room to wish him luck before his surgery, and he said he wanted to play Chopin's Waltz for me.<eos> It was her son's favorite song, just like mine.<eos> Listen, Debra, I appreciate everything that you're doing for us, but you shouldn't have taken him without telling me.<eos> Oh, I didn't.
But I have taken care of it.<eos> She will not be coming back.<eos> I know, because I've spoken to security, and they're under orders to notify the police if she returns.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Not good.<eos> The mother was extremely agitated.<eos> I had to assure her that we were gonna cover her son's entire procedure without charge so that she wouldn't threaten to sue us into the ground.<eos> Well, at least he'll be able to have his surgery here.<eos> Oh, is that what this is about?<eos> Your insistence on doing that boy's procedure?
(male announcer) Previously on Impastor...<eos> Oh, my gosh, I did it.<eos> You electrify me.<eos> You're having an affair with Dora.<eos> Dora?<eos> Did you come here to have your way with a poor, defenseless woman?<eos> You sure?<eos> And I find that incredibly sexy.<eos> You do?
Oh... Look, honey, I don't know him like you do.<eos> And for the record, I do not get my news about the world from Andy Flynn.<eos> [Chuckles] Look, I... brought your meds with me... [Pills rattle] ... and that little light that you like to use on menus.<eos> All right? And, Louie, I am very much looking forward to last night's dinner.<eos> Oh, and, just for fun, I made sure that we will have a table outside on the terrace with a view of the city, you know, just in case our meal turns out to be, um, memorable... in some way.<eos> Patrice... You think you're ready for this...<eos> [Sighs]<eos> I... if you still want to go. So...<eos> I say...<eos> I... do.
I've thought it over, and I'll do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> Turn evidence against bishop.<eos> What evidence, cary?<eos> I'll only do it if I have your guarantee You'll drop the charges against kalinda and diane.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me a day to get some ducks in a row,<eos> Odd how things turn out.<eos> A month ago, no one wanted to turn on bishop.<eos> Now everybody does.
Someone turned on bishop, and it was not me.<eos> She needs to tell bishop...<eos> It's not her either.<eos> What?<eos> Geneva pine approached me to turn evidence.<eos> Kalinda wasn't involved. It was me.<eos> It was you?<eos> How could it be you?<eos> I gave pine what I knew.<eos> You did?
I love you.<eos> And I want us to be together.<eos> Riding again?<eos> So soon after your injury?<eos> I've healed quickly.<eos> It brings me peace, being out in the woods.<eos> You mean, being alone.<eos> I know that this has been hard on you, too, our separation, but to see you flee an entire castle just to avoid being around me...<eos> - You needn't worry.<eos> - But I do.
General, your bravery will not soon be forgotten.<eos> We owe you a great debt of gratitude.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - Hear, hear!<eos> Lady Kenna.<eos> I trust you enjoyed your evening in the village?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> A queen's lady... in a brothel.<eos> So you saw me.<eos> I did.
I didn't want to be presumptuous.<eos> Not being presumptuous is sexy.<eos> Get on the bed.<eos> On your back.<eos> What you doing?<eos> What you do...<eos> What?<eos> Hello, Jasper.<eos> Thank you for admitting you never actually had a sex tape of me.<eos> Now you do.
It's good to seeing you, too.<eos> Good to seeing you too, Beck.<eos> It's gonna be a great weekend.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're like a 12-year-old girl around him.<eos> I hate you times infinity!<eos> 'Hello, Jasper.<eos> Thank you for admitting that you never actually had a sex tape of me.<eos> Now you do.'
Turn round.<eos> Okay.<eos> Put this on.<eos> Whoa, nice rack!<eos> Just give me the dress.<eos> Who is Beck?<eos> Beck was Robert's best friend.<eos> We basically grew up together.<eos> I may have lost my virginity to him.<eos> Alright, I did.
You're not alone.<eos> Stay.<eos> Just for a little while.<eos> Boadicea was Britain's greatest warrior queen.<eos> She had knives affixed to the wheels of her chariot, to cut the legs off invading armies.<eos> I suggest that you sharpen yours.<eos> The vote has not yet reached the people, so you still have time.<eos> Bleak as things are, the war is not over.<eos> You will find the strength to do what's necessary.<eos> Just as I did.
Was it the Queen?<eos> You're the Prince Regent.<eos> We secure you first and then the others.<eos> So if that's true, why was he already here when I arrived?<eos> I was already in the tunnels.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you were coming back after attacking our father?<eos> Go ahead. Insinuate and accuse.<eos> I for one will not lower myself to participate.<eos> You just did.
I said I wouldn't ask him to call you, because I won't.<eos> I stood by and let you have your moment with him.<eos> I let your romance be whatever it was going to be.<eos> And for a girl in my position, I was fairly gracious about it all.<eos> How many times have you called him, or texted him, or sent word to him through Marcus or your father, since the King was attacked?<eos> And how many times has he replied?<eos> He's moved on.<eos> Just as he did with all the others.<eos> Eventually he'll call me.<eos> Because he always does.
If we tell them before we go, then we'll never go.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> The truth is... I'm not going without you.<eos> You're going on a little trip.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Three years in Gibraltar, caring for the diseased and infirm.<eos> Your service is immensely noble and inspiring.<eos> I did what you asked me to do.<eos> I declared the Prince and Princess illegitimate.<eos> Yes, you did.
He's not like you.<eos> He never was... and he never will be.<eos> Your father doesn't have much time left.<eos> This is your time now.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Mum.<eos> I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too.<eos> And so does Cyrus.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Of course he does.
It's been my sincere pleasure knowing you.<eos> The pleasure's mine... sir.<eos> Very noble of you, Marcus.<eos> Watching the girl of your dreams ride off into the sunset and letting her go.<eos> Too bad she won't be going to New York for that audition, though.<eos> We Kensingtons are patrons of the arts.<eos> My parents hear things.<eos> She deserves to be happy.<eos> They both do.<eos> Of course they do.
You'll always be the someday I want.<eos> But I have to go back and you have to stay.<eos> It'll be easier this way.<eos> The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States.<eos> And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday.<eos> But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
- Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> You gotta ask yourself, who "they" are.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mostly operate UAV's.<eos> At least, I did.
And anyway, even if I did buy the stuff of a life, there's nowhere for me to put it because I'm not sure this dude really wanted me to move in because I'm an irresponsible monster who burned down her apartment with her vibrator!<eos> I'm just gonna leave you with this checklist for college freshmen.<eos> "Hair dryer.<eos> Hair dryer..."<eos> "Shower shoes."<eos> More wings.<eos> - Uh... - I said I'll tell you when I've had enough.<eos> I really like your shirt-- it shows off your shoulder.<eos> Did you find everything you need?<eos> Why, yes, I did.
- How much?<eos> - Check it out, you're gonna die.<eos> - Dying!<eos> - God!<eos> Dead!<eos> - Get it!<eos> - I already did.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, God, I can't wait to tell the boys!<eos> I already did.
He tore it out of her ear after he killed her, kept them all these years and now here they are.<eos> Hey, that's as good as a confession, right?<eos> Case closed?<eos> Three cases closed!<eos> Raquel, Thomas, Oliver!<eos> - Bam! - Mmm.<eos> - Yup, done and done.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go home, play some legos, make some pasta, because we are all done here.<eos> Done, done, done.
But it was true.<eos> The day before prom I walked into the girls' room and saw Raquel and some of the other seniors, and they were doing some sort of a drug deal.<eos> And no one ever had posted that about her before.<eos> And since you had never mentioned that you had gone to Riverlake, all of your fellow web-sleuthers thought you were this amazing detective who was able to suss out things no one else could.<eos> It was the first time that anyone thought what I had to say was important.<eos> So I became KC Moss and started my online radio show.<eos> Can you explain why your fingerprints are at the flower shop?<eos> Episode six.<eos> Last week I went down there, poked around, tried to find some clues.<eos> Of course you did.
Billy, I need you there now.<eos> - Ethan...<eos> - You're gonna pay for this.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing.<eos> I'm doing what I set out to do.<eos> I'm solving this murder.<eos> Raquel was my friend and you killed her!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, but I do.
I'm doing what I set out to do.<eos> I'm solving this murder.<eos> Raquel was my friend and you killed her!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No, but I do.<eos> Ethan, I understand everything.<eos> Raquel was your first love and she cheated on you!<eos> Yes, you made a mistake.<eos> But it was her fault, she betrayed you.<eos> Hell yes, she did!
I mean, he-he was a... he was a good friend.<eos> He knew Annie and I's story and... knew how desperate I was.<eos> So when you questioned him, he, uh... he asked me to come to his house.<eos> He-he asked me if I took the baby.<eos> And I just... I...<eos> I lost it.<eos> I...<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
~ At ease, Corporal.<eos> Now, what can I do for you?<eos> Sir, it's about Faruq's visa.<eos> He won't get it until 2022.<eos> By which time the Taliban will be using his skull as a novelty commode.<eos> Tricky.<eos> Trouble is, Captain Best didn't exactly give him a glowing reference.<eos> So, if he had a better reference...?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, I do.
Once possessed, the body stops aging, stops dying.<eos> Your life isn't over, General.<eos> And neither was the angel that you loved.<eos> You've spoiled me into almost believing I'm human.<eos> Clementine?<eos> - I've missed you so much.<eos> - I'm not leaving you again.<eos> Then we'll both die and Vega will be lost.<eos> I don't believe in Alex, Michael.<eos> But you do.
We just booked a gig at Lenny Destefano's birthday party!<eos> So, are you in the band, Darryl?<eos> Heck, yeah, I'm in the band!<eos> Yeah!<eos> The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee just got their first giggy!<eos> You guys, I blocked out my schedule every day after school for band practice.<eos> Every day?<eos> That's a lot of practice.<eos> We don't want to sound too rehearsed.<eos> Uh, yeah, Gene, we do.
We missed all your funny banana jokes.<eos> That one where you pretend the banana is your penis.<eos> Eh, don't love that one.<eos> Why? It's a little easy.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you mean, "easy"?<eos> He's got other ones.<eos> Like what?<eos> Which ones?<eos> He does the banana mustache, he does Captain Banana...
Good.<eos> We're not waiting around for him to make the next move.<eos> Okay.<eos> How many suspects are we down to, McGee?<eos> Eight hundred.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what if we just limit it to suspects with prior work in Afghanistan?<eos> Oh, what a good idea.<eos> Gee, why didn't we do that hours ago?
Watching her wasn't enough.<eos> You had to see her.<eos> Touch her.<eos> And when she refused you, you killed her.<eos> She was alone.<eos> Why didn't I just kill her right there?<eos> Maybe you wanted Cade Lasalle to take the fall.<eos> Strangled her.<eos> Put the rope in his hands.<eos> Cade did this.
Cade did this.<eos> I bet you he's even done it before.<eos> You would know.<eos> Stalking other girls...<eos> I went to rehab for-for my issues.<eos> You raped and tortured Windi because of your issues.<eos> No alibi, Gorie!<eos> No one saw you at that auction!<eos> I was across the street from her apartment all night, waiting for her to come back.<eos> And she never did.
Savannah was killed with a single bullet to the chest.<eos> Contact abrasions on the entry wound indicate...<eos> A silencer.<eos> Baitfish's signature.<eos> How about the other victims?<eos> Come.<eos> I have my findings pulled up in Sebastian's lab.<eos> Officer Jensen was shot multiple times in the neck and head.<eos> Officer Reeves, on the other hand, was shot once in the abdomen and by all accounts should have survived.<eos> Why didn't he?
Are you here to thank me?<eos> Here to arrest you.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in.<eos> I know, Sasha.<eos> About the port, the trucks, the shipping company.<eos> I'm a businesswoman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
Now!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Christopher.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Are you quite well?<eos> I will be all right as long as no one asks me how I am.<eos> You heard your note nearly proved fatal to poor Denker?<eos> Well, I only intended that she be ticked off, not beheaded.<eos> I gather it was Spratt who saved her, which is a surprise in any number of ways.<eos> Mama, what are you doing?<eos> Carson, Carson, can you change these place cards in the dining room?<eos> - I'm not sure her ladyship...<eos> - Robert?<eos> - Just do it.
God, Ali, no, it's not like that.<eos> You think it yourself.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> 'You've reached Spencer.<eos> Leave a..'<eos> Hanna?<eos> Dr. Sullivan.<eos> I'm so glad to see you here.<eos> I called, did your mother tell you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she did.
- Don't do what?<eos> Don't try to catch me in a lie, it's humiliating.<eos> I am trying to keep you safe.<eos> If it wasn't Andrew, then, that means whoever did this to you is still out there, is still a threat.<eos> God, I wanna put an end to this whole thing once and for all.<eos> I don't think you wanna put an end to this so much as you wish it never happened.<eos> 'Well, it did happen.'<eos> It happened to me, and it happened to my friends 'and that is not something that gets forgotten.<eos> You know, when I was down there, I just.. I kept thinking, if we could just make it out if we could just survive, and get out and come back home 'then everything was gonna be alright.'<eos> 'And then, we did.'
Thank God you're okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I wanna make sure Sara doesn't hear us.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Well, I was, uh, on campus and I went by the photo studio and they said you hadn't come in.<eos> Then when I came home and you weren't here and you didn't pick up your phone, I panicked.<eos> I-I know, my phone died and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I.. ...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.
- Oh, hi.<eos> Spencer?<eos> Spencer.<eos> Yes, I'm a friend of Ezra's.<eos> So you want to place a pastry order?<eos> Um, not exactly.<eos> I, um..<eos> Sorry. Um..<eos> I don't know if you know my story.<eos> I do.
Whatcha lookin' at?<eos> We were so innocent back then.<eos> And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself.<eos> I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?
And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself.<eos> I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
- Were they?<eos> - No.<eos> Why did you sneak out in the middle of the night like that?<eos> I don't wanna cause any problems between you and your mom.<eos> Did she say something to scare you off?<eos> No.<eos> If-if you overheard anything she said yesterday...<eos> I'm screwed up, Emily.<eos> I know it, your mom knows it..<eos> ...and you do too.
- Oh, you lived there too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did eight months.<eos> I was running crank for the Mongols.<eos> Bureau sold that apartment as "next door to a sex party."<eos> Ah. Yeah, that's the spot, man.<eos> I tell you, after a long day in the field, the last thing you need is to hear some bimbo screaming, "Harder," through the walls, you know?<eos> Well, small world.<eos> You know, Colby, I actually do have a room opening up here.<eos> No, you don't.
'Mona? '<eos> Lesli?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing in Rosewood?<eos> - I was summoned by the police.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> You made me an accomplice to a crime.<eos> - But you didn't do anything.
Lesli?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing in Rosewood?<eos> - I was summoned by the police.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> You made me an accomplice to a crime.<eos> - But you didn't do anything.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I really believe you can make a difference with these kids.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Uh, you remember Lorenzo?<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is this your idea of a replacement?<eos> 'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you.<eos> - He did.
And she was passing out juice-boxes while the rest of us were making sure that we still had kidneys!<eos> What's takin' Hanna so long?<eos> I don't know, she probably has to drag Mona here on a leash.<eos> Oh, Spencer, we saw A jump off a building.<eos> A set up an underground bunker with more spy equipment than the CIA.<eos> I mean, seriously, in your heart do you believe that Lesli Stone could...<eos> People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train... But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
I can pass along any...<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Ezra?<eos> Why-why do I know that name?<eos> I-I feel like Emily had a teacher.<eos> Yes, that would be me.<eos> I had bit of a career change.<eos> - I'm Nicole Gordon.<eos> I worked with Emily in Haiti.<eos> We did that housing program.
I'll check over there.<eos> You check back there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nicole?<eos> Well, at least you still look like Emily.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we finished the project.<eos> So I came back to see my dad and thought I'd make a little detour.<eos> Hey, do, either of you want coffee?<eos> - Yeah. - I-I'll do it.
Because every time you're near me, I...<eos> I just wanna grab you and kiss you.<eos> And the fact that you have a boyfriend isn't the problem.<eos> The problem is, I don't care.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - God, Caleb.<eos> I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to freak you out.<eos> I let myself in.<eos> Your mom made me a key.<eos> - Of course, she did.
Work?<eos> Sara's got a job?<eos> That's great.<eos> God, if I went through what she did, I don't think I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to...<eos> We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
Sorry.<eos> I tried callin' her a couple of times.<eos> She usually calls me back right away.<eos> I didn't know you two had a usually.<eos> Can you let her know I stopped by?<eos> Will do.<eos> And you can tell your guys to take off.<eos> Ali won't be back for a couple of days.<eos> I thought you didn't know when she'd be back.<eos> I don't.
We know who hired you for this party.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Charles?<eos> Look, get out of the way.<eos> You guys are totally off base.<eos> [grunting]<eos> Whose photo did you plan on shooting with this?<eos> Look, get your hands off of me, alright?<eos> You guys have no idea what you're doing.<eos> Actually, I do.
Can we start again?<eos> Um, I'm Jason.<eos> Jason DiLaurentis.<eos> 'Next, please.'<eos> Do you even go to school here?<eos> No.<eos> But I bet I'll be the prettiest girl in the yearbook.<eos> You didn't tell me your name.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Are you scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay, the results are in.<eos> And?<eos> - It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What doesn't?<eos> Barmal designed her serum to block the virus from entering human blood cells.<eos> - So where did she go wrong?<eos> - She didn't.
There are dozens of ways to walk home!<eos> And dozens of women walking!<eos> How will we know which one is her?<eos> I'm already forgetting what she looks like.<eos> She's a woman.<eos> I think she's... tall.<eos> Does she have glasses?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, she does.
You come back here this instant!<eos> I'm just really busy this weekend.<eos> I won't be able to see you.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> - No.<eos> Maybe next weekend.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, excuse me.<eos> Do you er... do you work here?<eos> I do.
I haven't finished explaining the protocol if your voice is recognised.<eos> Then you can admit to recognising theirs?<eos> That's correct.<eos> - Same time next week?<eos> The shift doesn't end for another 15 minutes.<eos> My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.
That couldn't have gone over too well.<eos> I can scratch off number fifteen off my list.<eos> "She would regret never getting"...<eos> April Carver got fired from a job?<eos> I'm trying something new.<eos> I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.
Those were equity investments.<eos> Right, partner?<eos> Come on, whatever happened to "if we're not failing, we're not trying," huh?<eos> Yeah, I know, that sounds fantastic.<eos> I just, I can't...<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Equity's only gonna get more expensive.<eos> You're gonna regret this.<eos> I already do.
You don't have a job.<eos> Your words sting, but I know it's because you care.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's your hurry?<eos> Last time we saw you, you were begging for our protection.<eos> And now you want nothing to do with us.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> Or do.
Come on.<eos> Ready when you are.<eos> Latitude: 33.4.<eos> Longitude: 118.2.<eos> That's San Pedro.<eos> Ship's still in port, in L.A.<eos> He stays with the truck.<eos> We had deal.<eos> The deal was we bring you with us.<eos> And we did.
Here.<eos> Start by getting yourself a lap dance.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Go on.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not that one... she's kind of my strip club wife.<eos> All right, good boy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you want to get a lap dance with me?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do.
What the hell's going on?<eos> You told me not to think about dicks, so my brain got real bored and I started reading these Web sites, and then some other Web sites that disagreed with the first Web sites.<eos> Did you know about global warming?<eos> It's a huge threat, but at the same time is made up by a bunch of socialist lib-tards.<eos> My question is, who benefits?<eos> You have to follow the money, Gretch.<eos> Big oil, the Middle East.<eos> Benghazi!<eos> I don't want to talk about Benghazi.<eos> Nobody does!
But this is me apologizing to you all...<eos> I-Is the mouse in that box?<eos> Rocket ship to Heaven.<eos> How did we barely even hang today?<eos> I'm about to start my annual Arliss re-watch.<eos> You in?<eos> I'll FaceTime you.<eos> I don't think your friends like me very much.<eos> What?<eos> ! Of course they do.
- Hey.<eos> Uh, hi.<eos> I, uh, I brought this.<eos> Oh, wine, thanks.<eos> Oh, damn it, my back! - Are you okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> It just hurts 'cause my dick's so big.<eos> Nah, he's always showing us his tiny dick, and the bit is he pretends like it's all big.<eos> So your back doesn't hurt?<eos> No, actually it does.
I don't understand.<eos> What about Mama?<eos> Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,<eos> "Allowed to step down after so many years of noble service."<eos> Golly.<eos> They've sacked the Captain.<eos> You can see their point.<eos> How could they have someone in the management of the new system who thinks the whole idea is a horrible mistake?<eos> - And you support this notion?<eos> - Of course he does.
Why wouldn't I be?<eos> - Going away?<eos> - Do you care?<eos> Look, I wasn't to know you hadn't told him.<eos> It never occurred to me --<eos> Just shut up!<eos> I don't know what's happened.<eos> Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa, or maybe it's just the same old Mary who wants her cake and ha'penny!<eos> - I never meant to --<eos> - Yes, you did!
- Are you in a rush?<eos> - Not particularly.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I need you to come with me to the station.<eos> - Then you can drive the car home.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Up to London.<eos> I haven't said goodbye to anyone and I can't bear to look at Mary.<eos> - She's unhappy. I think she regrets what she did.<eos> - Not as much as I do.
I apologise.<eos> It's just nobody can believe that I know my own mind.<eos> Of course, M'Lady.<eos> - Right.<eos> Can I do anything more for you?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Good night.<eos> And Anna... .. I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't know that's the end.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I could fail miserably and make a fool of myself and never be able to face him again. Fine.<eos> Then let Sean take a shot.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> (Buddy) The funeral made me realize Buddy Dobbs, the dirt bag, was gone forever.<eos> I was now Jonathan Barlow, trusted pastor.<eos> In light of this criminal connection, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really know about this guy?<eos> I Googled Pastor Barlow the day he got here.<eos> There's almost nothing online about him.<eos> Let's face it... we don't even know exactly why he was relieved of his duties in Florida. - I do.<eos> - You do?
~ Can't I just take it?<eos> ~ Really, Boss?<eos> ~ Oh, Bird, we're...<eos> Can't fucking believe it.<eos> My parents are going to meet me at Brize.<eos> They were meant to be having dinner with my sister, ~ but they moved it to the next day - they can't wait to see me.<eos> ~ There you go...<eos> We had this massive heart-to-heart and... Ngh, oh... They love me, Towerblock.<eos> They fucking love me.<eos> ~ Of course they do.
~ Simon!<eos> ~ Boss, just give him a minute.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll sit next to him on the plane, have a heart-to-heart.<eos> Right. OK, one more thing...<eos> No, no, no, like it or not... .. I got the best souvenir.<eos> Mac, there was no competition, it was just...<eos> Nice!<eos> You said it would be OK, if I just found it lying on the ground.<eos> Yes, I did.
Okay.<eos> About what?<eos> About when I went missing, I think.<eos> And so why didn't you want to tell me about it?<eos> Probably because I didn't want to make a big deal of it.<eos> But it is a big deal.<eos> You lost two months of your life.<eos> And you're dreaming about it now?<eos> - I don't think you should ignore this.<eos> - I do.
Not anymore.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to be.<eos> We don't know this man's agenda.<eos> No, no, Beckett.<eos> I need to be...<eos> What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there.<eos> Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.<eos> - Why would I be a target? - I don't know.<eos> And neither do you.
Well, yes, but he's my punk.<eos> You had him kill that chef?<eos> Come on, get a name!<eos> Madison?<eos> You heard that?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Only people believe that are cops, man.<eos> S-So he didn't?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Then who did?
We can apply for an exemption...<eos> Sammy's not going back to Abuddin.<eos> - Um... - Look, I know you're disappointed, but there's no way you're going back there.<eos> Okay, but this is my inheritance from my father, s...<eos> And I'm your mother and it's my job to keep you safe.<eos> I'm not gonna put you at risk for $100 million<eos> - or $100 billion.<eos> - O... Okay,<eos> - can we at least talk about it?<eos> - We just did.
Lots of light.<eos> Come... or you'll miss your plane.<eos> I decided you were right.<eos> Rami should go.<eos> It's the best thing for me, the best thing for all of us.<eos> So, good luck to him, wherever he goes next.<eos> Did you love her?<eos> Rami's mother.<eos> Did you love her?<eos> Yes, um, I did, very much.
Find someone to talk to about what happened.<eos> A friend, teammate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> __<eos> Marco.<eos> Your girlfriend would also be a good person to open up to.<eos> It's Sara, right?<eos> Did Sara understand your relationship with Triva?<eos> Sort of. You know how it is, old girl, new girl.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It'll be four, five hours.<eos> Laura, I told you I got this.<eos> You can run point, but me sitting on my ass staring at ceiling tiles in a waiting room won't help Jake.<eos> Laura, I'm so sorry.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Caucasian male, stocking mask, approximately 5'10", 180.<eos> The Captain intervened, the perp shot one single round 9 millimeter.<eos> Crime scene already has a casing.<eos> He saved that girl.<eos> Of course he did.
Like glasses for Grandma.<eos> We know.<eos> Glasses, headphones, robotic stuff.<eos> Word got around the neighborhood, and this guy, this really scary man, hired him.<eos> Forced him, really, and Joseph didn't have a choice.<eos> To make what?<eos> A gun.<eos> We had briefings on 3D-printed guns.<eos> They don't work.<eos> This one does.
Stay back!<eos> Pamela.<eos> Remember me?<eos> "Been there."<eos> Believe it or not, I've been here too.<eos> Not as bad.<eos> I can't even begin to imagine your suffering.<eos> But earlier today, I was face to face with the man who shot the father of my children in the chest.<eos> And I wanted so desperately to shoot him.<eos> But I didn't.
Is he okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Actually, he's alert, seems to be doing quite well.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> These look really, really good.<eos> - Did you guys see that?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
How about you let Clint here buy you a drink?<eos> Referring to yourself in the third person.<eos> Always a sign of a keeper.<eos> Just water for me, thanks.<eos> - I don't wanna get cross-faded.<eos> - Hear that.<eos> So, um, my friend Zach.<eos> He told me I could score some blow off of you.<eos> - You know Zach, right?<eos> - Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
~ 2,500 on October - ~ It was for personal use!<eos> ~ Another 2,500 - ~ Look, I borrowed some money!<eos> I know how much your earn, your bank loans, your credit cards -<eos> ~ I didn't get that money from Michael Collersdale. ~ Where'd you get it?<eos> ~ Who's this Michael Collersdale?<eos> ~ He's after Dad. ~ Was you frightened?<eos> ~ Course he was frightened!<eos> He stabbed someone like he didn't care, then went after Dom.<eos> ~ Dom must have done something real bad. ~ Like what?<eos> For someone to do all of that...
I do too, as long as you're there.<eos> Are you sure we can afford it?<eos> We'll make sure it's a priority.<eos> Deal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Oh, I think our bathroom is leaking again.<eos> I thought the plumber took care of that.<eos> He did.
The girl marries the prince.<eos> And they live happily ever after.<eos> I don't want to get married.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You don't have to do anything you don't want to.<eos> But I want to know what happy is.<eos> You are a very smart girl, and you can accomplish anything that you set your mind to, just like your mother.<eos> And someday, you might find someone that you love who loves you back.<eos> You haven't.<eos> I did.
Hey. All those computer wires stuffed into one outlet, they yours?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You got to be more careful.<eos> I use a power strip.<eos> I cut it off, I swear to God, I did.<eos> He doesn't know for sure that's what started it.<eos> You got to keep the faith, Billy.<eos> The truth comes out.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your SCBA?<eos> Oh, yeah, no.<eos> I'm using a spare.<eos> Mine's going to the repair shop.<eos> It's gonna get the regulator checked out.<eos> Hmm, cool, cool.<eos> Got to keep an eye on those things.<eos> Yeah.<eos> At first, I thought Otis was just talking smack, but watching Rice sit there after that call, reading the paper instead of troubleshooting his SCBA, it bugged me.<eos> So I did an 0800 checkout on it.
I know she is!<eos> Billy, look at me.<eos> I pulled you out of the fire.<eos> The least you can do is listen to what I have to say.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Listen, Victoria was raped, so whoever set that fire was trying to kill her.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear, I swear...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So do the police.<eos> They do?
The police are still investigating.<eos> I suppose I al... I always knew she... One day...<eos> Michael Collersdale was at her flat last night.<eos> ~ Did Gemma know that you were here?<eos> We've not spoken in years.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've never even met her.<eos> Is that why he went to see her, because of me?<eos> You know what? I didn't even know Ali had a sister.<eos> Yeah, you did.
He doesn't care about his presidency, Cyrus.<eos> He only cares about Liv.<eos> What does Liv want him to say?<eos> What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!
What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!<eos> Stop telling me the opposite of what I am telling you.<eos> I am too tired for this!<eos> I don't!
He's resting at home.<eos> By the time I got to the E.R., he was awake.<eos> He was stable.<eos> It was like nothing happened.<eos> They're running more tests, and no results yet.<eos> So they sent David home.<eos> He's doing okay, right?<eos> He's got lymphoma, Jack.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Amanda!<eos> - How is pleading guilty to a murder you didn't commit smart?<eos> Oh, after my incarceration,<eos> I decided that we needed a plan in place if... Well, more likely when, one of us ended up getting arrested again.<eos> So I boned up on all the specs and security for every hoosegow in a 200-mile radius. So...<eos> Emily pled guilty so she could be moved into a maximum security prison?<eos> Where we're gonna move her out.<eos> Your mother did unspeakable things to you, Victoria.<eos> I thought you'd banished her from your life.<eos> I did.
I ran into you and Sammy in the park?<eos> Suddenly, I felt like...<eos> Everything was gonna be okay.<eos> You've always made me feel safe, Jack.<eos> I know things...<eos> Got complicated since then with Aiden and Amanda...<eos> But I never stopped feeling that way when I was around you.<eos> I guess I'm just scared.<eos> This whole mess isn't over yet, and I don't know how it's gonna end.<eos> Neither do I.
You can't go to the monastery with me.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - l can too.<eos> You've never meditated.<eos> You always laughed when I talked about Zen.<eos> I'll kill myself.<eos> - No you won't.<eos> - Yes I will.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I will too.
Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> Where's Gaenor?<eos> I've a mind to kill you now, you know that?<eos> - Where's Gaenor?<eos> - But I won't.
Hear the wind In the rigging?<eos> And hear how Horatio Hornblower rescued his shipmate from prison.<eos> It wouldn't be like that.<eos> It would be just like that.<eos> You'd do the same for me if I were in your shoes.<eos> But you're not.<eos> And you never would be.<eos> Archie...<eos> I won't survive if you don't help me.<eos> None of us will.
Unfortunately, it's just another tree.<eos> Then what are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean do?<eos> Will you keep it alive or will you kill it?<eos> Whatever.<eos> This tree has no impact on the forest as a whole.<eos> What is it, then?<eos> I said it's just another dead tree.<eos> But if it recovers, it may start killing others again.<eos> No, it won't.
He who is considered competent will be able to move to Palestine.<eos> The trip to Palestine costs 1,500.<eos> Everyone has to pay for his own ticket.<eos> No-one earns enough for that.<eos> Who wants to register for the hachshara?<eos> No-one from the Polana galuth is registering for the hachshara?<eos> Will no-one see Palestine, the land of fortune and work?<eos> Will no-one taste the grapes from the land of Canaan of which each one must be carried individually by two men?<eos> So no-one wants to go?<eos> I will.
You can't fire somebody for bad hair.<eos> That is a jury question.<eos> This is discovery.<eos> We need to--<eos> Your Honor, this may seem silly but that is not simply a comb-over.<eos> It's that swirly kind.<eos> He's got hair circling around.<eos> - Would you buy insurance from him?<eos> - What if he gets a haircut?<eos> - He won't.
When he was killed, it was taken by a wealthy landowner named...<eos> - I don't want to bore you.<eos> - A bit late.<eos> ..named Gleaves.<eos> It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati are looking for it, for sentimental value.<eos> You don't think this amulet poses any threat? Oh, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Nonetheless, we may as well keep it from them.<eos> Buffy, you will go to the Gleaves family crypt and fetch the amulet.<eos> - I will?
- No, I totally get that now.<eos> And I got the grades, and I'm graduating tomorrow.<eos> I can forget all this crap.<eos> Well, after graduation, he may not have the chance to forget it all.<eos> I'm just trying to keep things light.<eos> But things aren't light.<eos> I mean, it's bad enough we have to fight the Mayor.<eos> I don't want him eating Percy and the whole class.<eos> We have to find a spell or something to stop the Ascension.<eos> Then we will.
Oh, yeah.<eos> The word is stamina.<eos> Definitely a bunny in the sack, but later on, well...<eos> You know the difference between a freshman girl and a toilet seat?<eos> The toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.<eos> - I can't believe I did that.<eos> - Welcome to the club.<eos> Know how much trouble you could get into?<eos> If Parker reported you...<eos> - He won't.
- Whoever or whatever.<eos> - I'm not interested in guesswork, gentlemen.<eos> Call me old-fashioned.<eos> I like results.<eos> This report reads like a child's riddle book.<eos> Agent Finn, tell me something good.<eos> My implant?<eos> The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature without intense neurological pain, can't feed, can't hardly even hit any more.<eos> - We'll bag it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
- Thank you.<eos> I was too far away.<eos> It was lucky.<eos> She almost got hit.<eos> Willow, what's the matter?<eos> Maybe you should take her home.<eos> Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourself over.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.<eos> I will, though.
But I don't have reservations, so why don't we just go now?<eos> - No no.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Are you gonna take the class today?<eos> Maybe.<eos> No, you're not!<eos> Well, there's an extra space in case you decide to stay.<eos> Mm.<eos> What, you're not taking the class?<eos> Maybe I will.
Mowbray?<eos> Wasn't that the nom de plume you used in prep school for your society column?<eos> What a remarkable coincidence.<eos> You were secretly trying to outbid me.<eos> All right. I thought if you were bidding against a stranger, you'd go so high, but if it was me, then your childish competitiveness would kick in.<eos> Well, that is nonsense.<eos> Give me the pen.<eos> No, no, I'm saving you from yourself.<eos> - Give me that.<eos> - I will not.
And when we got home, we started talking.<eos> We ended up staying up half the night.<eos> - Oh, Roz, I'm glad for you, but...<eos> - It was like a wall came down.<eos> She just opened up to me.<eos> She started telling me about how hard it was on her when my dad left and how lonely she's been.<eos> It was like she was talking to a girlfriend, instead of her screw-up daughter.<eos> So has Martin called her yet?<eos> No.<eos> But he will, soon.
Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.<eos> I was gonna be homeless.<eos> You just saved me.<eos> You're my hero.<eos> Hero?<eos> I don't know. Well, all right.<eos> I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You're gonna say things now, aren't you?<eos> No. No, I won't.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!<eos> You know when I said that I want you to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?<eos> You're not ready.<eos> I didn't think I was!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What would you have done if I had said yes?<eos> I would've been happy because I would spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.<eos> Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.<eos> Will you pass that knife?<eos> No, I will not.
My father knows about these things.<eos> It is its rectum.<eos> No, no.<eos> It is tight, though.<eos> No wonder it's a difficult labour.<eos> Ah!<eos> These feel like the hooves.<eos> I'lljust get the rope around them.<eos> Who would like to come up here and help me pull the baby calf out?<eos> - I will.
It's all right.<eos> The Prophets brought us together.<eos> That's the last of it.<eos> Tell Kilby to start the final departure check.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I don't care about the Prophets.<eos> I want to marry you.<eos> We'll worry about the rest later.<eos> Ben, don't do this to me, not if you're going to change your mind again.<eos> I won't.
Darts, racquetball, Vic's lounge, the Alamo...<eos> Need I go on?<eos> I love my wife.<eos> And I love Ezri.<eos> Passionately.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Have you told her?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But I will.
All right.<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Brother Teal'c, at precisely 6.03pm tomorrow, we're going home.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Your theory is confirmed.<eos> Where do we have to be for tomorrow's flare?<eos> Washington, DC.<eos> We're almost there, sir.<eos> We must find a power source right away.<eos> We will.
It may prove invaluable.<eos> I have come seeking assistance to rescue my friends and your fellow Tok'ra.<eos> I believe Sokar will soon learn that Apophis has eliminated Bynarr... ..and will take action to restore control.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I will consult the High Council and return shortly with a course of action.<eos> Ow!<eos> God...!<eos> Major Carter was most forthcoming.<eos> She didn't tell you squat.<eos> By the way, I won't either.
I think I'm the best judge of what I mean you paranoid Berkeley shiksa feminista.<eos> - That was way too far.<eos> - No.<eos> I've got a meeting and so do you you elitist Harvard fascist missed-the-Dean's-List- two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jackass!<eos> - Feel better with that off your chest?<eos> - I'm a new woman.<eos> - You look great.<eos> - Don't try to make up.<eos> - I'll talk to Sam.<eos> - I will.
I don't.<eos> I do care about hanging a sign that says:<eos> "Republicans and Congress, feel free to slap us around to show us you can. "<eos> - You don't like Broderick and Eaton.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - It is the point.<eos> - How?<eos> When you're competitive and combative, you juice up the president.<eos> - I'll keep that in mind.<eos> - No, you won't.
That's what happens.<eos> Eight states will divide $5 million to research the uses of wood.<eos> - We saw that one.<eos> - I'm thinking of uses for it now.<eos> Let's talk about the census.<eos> The White House just wanted to say that you're criminals and despots.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> That won't stop the president from signing.<eos> No, it won't.
- Can you stay long?<eos> - No, I brought you stuff from home.<eos> - You didn't have to.<eos> - I wanted you to have stuff you like.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're okay at the hotel?<eos> I wanted Mom to have the house.<eos> But you're gonna look for a place, right?<eos> Mallory, this thing with your mother and me will blow over.<eos> No, it won't, Dad.
Zoey, does your father know?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - So this is gonna be a thing.<eos> Zoey and I have decided that it's time we start collecting IOUs.<eos> - She didn't bring my grasshopper.<eos> - No?<eos> - Maybe she felt stupid ordering it.<eos> - It's a perfectly...<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> - I will.
You're playing with fire.<eos> - No way to do this without Toby?<eos> - No.<eos> Hang on! C.J.!<eos> Talk to Toby.<eos> Just Toby.<eos> You're late.<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> - I'd definitely talk to him.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Love at first sight?<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> The son of your deceased friend Zarija dropped by.<eos> He came for help.<eos> All his money is being stolen.<eos> I've got a score to settle with those villians, with Little Grga.<eos> We'll skin them like cats and eat them alive.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> I want to see the grave of Zarija.<eos> As you will, grandad.
Tell him you're a movie producer.<eos> You've read the book - and want the movie rights.<eos> - Good idea!<eos> Then casually, - you ask about his co-author.<eos> - Co-author?<eos> My wife!<eos> He wrote it with her!<eos> Right, sorry.<eos> - It'll never work!<eos> - It will!
What kind of painkillers they give you?<eos> Gentlemen, clear out of here.<eos> You too, Bob.<eos> Kiss the Nationals goodbye.<eos> There goes the team title right down the toilet.<eos> Shut the door!<eos> Why don't you run the 3-mile, Russ?<eos> We need my 10 points to win the Nationals.<eos> 3 miles of pounding on a hard asphalt track can tear your foot in two.<eos> It won't.
Dottie?<eos> Mona?<eos> Princess Grace is here and she is thirsty"<eos> What?<eos> "This way, you are on. Come on"<eos> No<eos> Shaney...<eos> It has been a mean night.<eos> Okay? And I'll cry about it tomorrow.<eos> I will
A pure colony.<eos> A colony reborn.<eos> Moments from now this tunnel will open.<eos> The past will be washed away and a new day will dawn.<eos> A stirring speech, General.<eos> I only wish my daughter were here to appreciate it.<eos> Your Majesty, I know how concerned you are about Bala.<eos> But my scouts are on her trail and it's only a matter of time... General, I don't want to discuss it.<eos> Just find her.<eos> I will, Your Highness.
- All right.<eos> You guys clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jones, Krug, what, are you guys from communications?<eos> - No, we're ops.<eos> - You can tell by their haircuts.<eos> I would like to sit down with Mr. Pintero in private... so he and I can discuss what's happening to me.<eos> I called; they said he was here.<eos> Mr. Pintero would like to help you.<eos> But he won't.
Anyone tell you too much persistence can get stupid?<eos> Constantly.<eos> I hear the same thing.<eos> I also hear I read too slow.<eos> I don't need glasses.<eos> Eyes being a figment of my imagination.<eos> You'll hear a lot of smart stuff here.<eos> It's usually right.<eos> Don't let it screw you up.<eos> I won't.
- Yeah, but I got my bike.<eos> Hey, no problem.<eos> Okay, try it.<eos> Suzie, you need a lift?<eos> We got room for one more.<eos> Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes, "Whores 4 Less"?<eos> Try it again.<eos> Nice to see you kids getting along.<eos> - Don't forget Sunday.<eos> - I won't.
This just gets better!<eos> No wonder he sucks up to Rog.<eos> Brings him apples, blankets, coffee....<eos> Not a word.<eos> I'm telling you, nothing!<eos> I won't tell.<eos> He'd shoot me just for being the messenger.<eos> He's my best friend.<eos> It'd be wrong to mess with him.<eos> I won't.
I found a detective, the second he found you, here I am.<eos> You gotta understand, this isn'tjust about me, all right?<eos> Like anybody, I have a lot of responsibilities.<eos> I'm engaged. I have a fiancée.<eos> I want to start a family.<eos> Family's wonderful.<eos> Lewis would like to have kids too.<eos> If you can postpone having yours for a few years, he'll have that chance.<eos> I'm staying at the Stanhope. Could you call me there tonight?<eos> - All right. I will. - Thanks.
What's the fowls?<eos> Oh, you...<eos> She likes to have the fowls brought to her each morning.<eos> You're the young woman come to look after my birds.<eos> I hope you'll be kind to them.<eos> Well, where are they?<eos> She's eating enough.<eos> I believe so, ma'am.<eos> Feed her up. Feed her up.<eos> Yes, I will.
There's nothing to drink.<eos> What about this?<eos> "Longovital.<eos> Herb and vitamin tablets".<eos> Drop it, Elin...<eos> - What about Alvidon?<eos> - Come on! Nothing'll happen.<eos> Yes... But I want to take some drugs!<eos> - But nothing'll happen.<eos> - Yes it will.
Who's at that corner?<eos> Err...<eos> Jean-Bat, Nº 7. Call him, he's the opening act.<eos> Nº 7, Jean-Bat! Are you there?<eos> Yes, I'm here.<eos> You're the first, are you ready?<eos> Yes, no problem.<eos> So it's our turn now.<eos> Daniel, it won't fit!<eos> Yes it will...
Tell me something to make me love you. Oh.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Uh... Tell me your big tragedy.<eos> What tragedy?<eos> About the girl you loved who ran away or died.<eos> She died.<eos> It's pretty obvious.<eos> Well, people die all over.<eos> You have to put it into perspective.<eos> Soon we all will.
"that I watched it with full eyes...<eos> "that I caressed it with both hands.<eos> "I am here waiting for you, trembling.<eos> "Give me this day."<eos> Alexandre!<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> You don't like it, I know, but today is my day.<eos> I won't go to the hospital.<eos> I won't go to the hospital, Anna.<eos> I won't.
I've come to see Grunya.<eos> Grunya?<eos> That's all.<eos> Hello.<eos> So that's what you do here, Mr. Kohl.<eos> You won't fool me anymore!<eos> I saw everything!<eos> Everything!<eos> I won't permit it!<eos> I simply won't!
No I can't.<eos> It's always this or that.<eos> We can't live like this.<eos> But he's a friend isn't he?<eos> He is.<eos> But there are more friends in the world.<eos> Especially when they ask for favours.<eos> That's life.<eos> - Tell him I dropped by.<eos> I will.
You think so?<eos> The way he's at peace with himself.<eos> As it all was said and done.<eos> In fact... I don't think he'll make it.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It's what the doctor said after the operation.<eos> Does Adrien know?<eos> I think so.<eos> He won't mention it...<eos> He never will.
And, for what it's worth, I think he loves me as well.<eos> And is that really enough, do you think, in this day and age?<eos> Well, I suppose it has to be, Mr Greenway.<eos> In this day and age or any other.<eos> Because if it isn't... what else is there, eh?<eos> (door)<eos> I won't go with them, Mister Tom!<eos> I won't go with them!<eos> - Oh, won't ya?<eos> - No, I won't!
- Birthday surprise.<eos> Who thought of this?<eos> - You'll know.<eos> Listen, feel yourself.<eos> - Feel myself?<eos> Potential theme song.<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - Aren't birthdays fun?<eos> Renee's never gonna believe me.<eos> - She will.
- Lf this is what he wants to paint...<eos> If these ever found their way into the market his legacy would be ruined.<eos> You're concerned with what people will say?<eos> My father prayed to leave behind two things:<eos> My mother. And his artistic legacy.<eos> Mom died first.<eos> I couldn't help him.<eos> But his reputation?<eos> That I can help preserve.<eos> And I will.
I don't want my kids listening to how their dad might die.<eos> That shouldn't happen, but if it does, your wife can escort them out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's, it's late.<eos> I'll drive you home.<eos> - We'll see you tomorrow, huh?<eos> - Good night.<eos> BERNIE: Give me the keys, I'll drive.<eos> MICHAELSON: I will.
At least now they're out on the table where we can see them.<eos> Meaning he doesn't trust you.<eos> - Not as far as he can throw me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You want me to talk to him?<eos> - No.<eos> But thank you.<eos> No, he's my problem, not yours.<eos> You know, if I can't handle him I shouldn't be here.<eos> And I will.
He's taking on too much, pushing himself to the limit in combat training.<eos> Sometimes he's reckless.<eos> I wonder if he is trying to prove something.<eos> Maybe to me, maybe to himself or maybe to someone else?<eos> Let us say only that I'm also concerned.<eos> Watch him for me, Turval.<eos> If he continues in this way, let me know.<eos> Of course.<eos> And if you should ever need somebody to talk to, Delenn I hope you'll remember your old teacher from time to time.<eos> I will.
We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!<eos> - Have you dropped any hints?<eos> - I've dropped anvils.<eos> Oh, he'll come around.<eos> What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?<eos> At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.<eos> None of them know a thing.<eos> They all get an F in Willow.<eos> But I want Oz to get an A. And oh, one of those gold stars.<eos> - He will.
- What am I supposed to do until then?<eos> - Go to classes. Do homework.<eos> Have supper?<eos> Right... Be that Buffy.<eos> Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy.<eos> So much for our surprise party.<eos> I bought little hats and everything.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I guess I'll tell Cordelia.<eos> No, you won't.
If he fails, you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Please.<eos> I swear.<eos> OK.<eos> Hurry back, then.<eos> I should go the rest of the way alone.<eos> OK.<eos> But I'll be back.<eos> I will.
If you won't leave with me, girl... ..then you won't leave, at all!<eos> Kill me, my Lord.<eos> If I leave here with you, I am dead.<eos> A thread of cloth in a dead man's hair.<eos> You hang me, Cadfael. With that thread.<eos> Cadfael.<eos> Is that my property?<eos> It is Lady Donata's gift box.<eos> Will you wish me Godspeed, Brother Prior?<eos> Well, I will. Godspeed.
Listen...<eos> Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!<eos> -You want me to get that?<eos> Just let her do her thing and we'll do our thing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rachel?<eos> Can I talk to you outside for a sec?<eos> We really need to talk.<eos> Well, then talk.<eos> Okay, I will.
If I had called her, she never would have gone out with Nick.<eos> They wouldn't have ended up in bed.<eos> I threw her at his man-nipples!<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> Your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.<eos> Well, if she thought they were on a break...<eos> Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.<eos> Really?<eos> -Will you call him?<eos> -Yes, I will.
-But he has to know how I feel.<eos> -But why?<eos> He loves this Emily person.<eos> No good can come of this.<eos> -Well, I think you're wrong.<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> Well, he doesn't really love her.<eos> It's just a rebound thing from me.<eos> -You'll see.<eos> -Fortunately I won't.
Back in high school I had a major crush on you.<eos> I knew.<eos> You did?<eos> I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<eos> I did.<eos> Listen, do you think<eos> Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.<eos> Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
I know.<eos> I said a foolish thing.<eos> In your old job, you must have heard lots of jokes.<eos> – Sure.<eos> – Come on, let's hear one.<eos> Mmm. – Come on, tell us one.<eos> – No, Ian doesn't tell jokes.<eos> No, no, he's not a comedian.<eos> He just books the acts.<eos> All right, then, I will.
- I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.<eos> - No.<eos> No coconut for me.<eos> All right, I'll get you a Mounds bar.<eos> Keep the engine running.<eos> No, man, not the gas.<eos> But it needs it, Kramer.<eos> It needs it bad.<eos> You really think this will make you happy?<eos> Because it won't.
We can't rescue Moogie from a Dominion jail.<eos> - Not alone, anyway.<eos> - You're right.<eos> We'll need help.<eos> We could form a commando team, get the toughest mercenaries we can find.<eos> - Nausicaans, Breen, Klingon!<eos> - We don't need Nausicaans or Klingon.<eos> - Humans? - We'll just use Ferengi.<eos> - Then we'll all die!<eos> No, we won't!
Keevan.<eos> Right.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - l'm waiting.<eos> - He'll be right out.<eos> But first...my brother has to run some sensor scans to make sure they have really left.<eos> That is unnecessary.<eos> The Jem'Hadar are gone.<eos> - Now bring me Keevan.<eos> - l will, in a few minutes.
And open.<eos> Cassandra's been asking about you.<eos> Cassandra?<eos> Yeah! I've been so busy lately.<eos> She understands.<eos> - OK! Let me know if it gets worse.<eos> - I'm free to go out tomorrow, right?<eos> - We're researching relocation sites.<eos> - Sure. Cassandra will be with me tomorrow. Why not stop by and spend time with her?<eos> - I will.
You've been through it before and you survived.<eos> We're... just having a bad day.<eos> Colonel, I think I'm starting to see something.<eos> - My sight returns as well.<eos> - That's what I wanna hear.<eos> Carter, if someone comes in here, you bite 'em in the hand.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Forgive me, master. I will not fail Klorel again.<eos> No.<eos> You will not.
We're all going!<eos> That's impossible, sir.<eos> - I have to take you.<eos> - Mr President... it's time to get you off this plane.<eos> Go, sir. Go!<eos> Please, go.<eos> It was you?<eos> Give me the strap.<eos> I trusted you with my life.<eos> So will the next president.
I thought that one surely was real.<eos> Well, she was real. I mean, she was human, of course, but not our real.<eos> But we won't be fooled next time.<eos> No, I am going to think of really hard questions.<eos> No.<eos> My heart can't take it any more.<eos> I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.<eos> - Where is Uncle Boris from?<eos> - What if Sophie doesn't recognise me?<eos> She will.
- What do you do in the lake house?<eos> - If you come near it, I'll kill you.<eos> I'll murder you.<eos> - How? With a knife.<eos> I'll stab you in the heart.<eos> - Yes, that would do it.<eos> - It would.<eos> You'd be dead.<eos> - You'd have to bury me.<eos> - I won't.
Who's behind this?<eos> Who did this to me?<eos> - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> How deluded can you be?<eos> It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank.<eos> Get your boss up here.<eos> Tell him I'm gonna shoot someone.<eos> They won't do it.<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Does he masturbate?<eos> I don't know who you mean.<eos> But you know him !<eos> He said you'd had a fight.<eos> Well, he beat you up.<eos> That's untrue.<eos> - l'll say no more then.<eos> - You can't stop now.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - No, I won't.
I don't even know where we are.<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> i won't take you on.<eos> I'll put in a complaint.<eos> Do as you please.<eos> Just get off.<eos> I will file a complaint.<eos> Certainly.<eos> I'll really file a complaint.<eos> You won't.
Otherwise, you might have died there.<eos> Then you wouldn't be taking Judas silver from the rich in order to keep down the people you came from.<eos> Do you want work, Dan?<eos> - I'll find you a place with the yeomanry.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Nine years I fought.<eos> King and country.<eos> For what, eh?<eos> I'm done with bloody uniforms.<eos> As you will.
You murdering bastards!<eos> What happened in the square was not my doing.<eos> - It was your men.<eos> - Dan!<eos> To us. Man.<eos> Stand back, or more will die.<eos> Aye.<eos> And you among 'em.<eos> You should leave, Sharpe.<eos> - I will not.
What are you, a general?<eos> Lieutenant Colonel.<eos> Strewth, live well on that, you could.<eos> - Well, I could.<eos> - I do.<eos> More money than I've ever been paid in my life.<eos> Sad, innit?<eos> And now you'll most likely get killed.<eos> - Not me. - Yeah, you will.<eos> No, I won't.
If you don't want to, don't answer.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> How do you explain what happened?<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> - There is no explanation.<eos> - I believe there is.<eos> - You believe I'm mad.<eos> - I only believe what I see.<eos> You haven't let me see your face yet.<eos> And I won't.
But it was him.<eos> In my arms, he was as light as a child.<eos> I was afraid to hurt him.<eos> It'll happen to me, Lucas.<eos> I'll become like Jerome.<eos> Maybe you won't stay to the end.<eos> I have no right to ask you to.<eos> If you want to go, I won't stop you.<eos> I won't leave you.<eos> I never will.
- We need to laugh.<eos> What we need is one good, dirty joke.<eos> Disgusting dirty.<eos> Anybody feel they could use that kind of joke?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm talking filthy!<eos> This is all under protest now.<eos> This is a warm-up act.<eos> - They still have to laugh at the joke.<eos> - And I won't.
She did that on purpose.<eos> Yes, I believe she did.<eos> I will deal with this.<eos> Yeah, and don't you forget it.<eos> Mr. Allan, if I may observe your problem with the new uniform is not the new uniform, is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just feel like if I take his uniform I'm admitting the chief's never coming back to his job.<eos> I wish I could wait longer, but the captain says it's important for things to get back to normal, but that won't happen until the chief's back.<eos> And if Mr. Garibaldi does not take back his job?<eos> He will.
Yes, I believe she did.<eos> I will deal with this.<eos> Yeah, and don't you forget it.<eos> Mr. Allan, if I may observe your problem with the new uniform is not the new uniform, is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just feel like if I take his uniform I'm admitting the chief's never coming back to his job.<eos> I wish I could wait longer, but the captain says it's important for things to get back to normal, but that won't happen until the chief's back.<eos> And if Mr. Garibaldi does not take back his job?<eos> He will.<eos> He will.
Ivanova, good.<eos> I was just about to call you.<eos> I've been going over these reports trying to figure out how we're going to get along with all our supply shipments from Earth cut off by the embargo.<eos> We've got two, maybe three months of reserves.<eos> Then we are going to run out of things.<eos> Small things at first, then more important things.<eos> Something breaks, we may not be able to fix it.<eos> And you can forget the spare parts for the fighters.<eos> We can go black market if we have to.<eos> We will.
You just said to her<eos> You wanna go out with me because of my wig, the big boobs, and I serve you food.<eos> If that were true, I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.<eos> And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.<eos> You think she should go out with me, don't you?<eos> You sure you wanna go out with her?<eos> That ain't a pretty picture in the morning.<eos> That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Oh, I will.
For the first time in my life after my dad left me and then getting arrested for stealing those birds and then the whole punctured-lung thing.<eos> It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.<eos> And now it's gone, and I don't know why.<eos> Well, I can tell you why.<eos> It's because of me.<eos> But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?<eos> What?<eos> I kind of had a little chat with Alice and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.<eos> And you'll see it too, one day.<eos> You really, really will.
Wow, isn't this great?<eos> Yeah, me too, a girl.<eos> All right.<eos> Way to go, grandpa.<eos> You know, I got a feeling that's gonna happen a lot.<eos> God, I hope so.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have to cut back my time at the magazine.<eos> I'll need to find someone.<eos> Yes, you will.
Don't look at him.<eos> I'm telling you to leave.<eos> - l find him useful.<eos> - ln the future it might be prudent for you to include me in all decisions regarding station policy.<eos> Now...what about the wormhole?<eos> You should have dismantled the minefield a month ago.<eos> I admit the work is proceeding more slowly than expected, but as you know, these are not ordinary mines.<eos> Every time we deactivate or destroy one of them, its neighbour replicates a new one.<eos> We have to take down that minefield and reopen the wormhole.<eos> And we will.
Cardassia was on the edge of an abyss, Major.<eos> The war with the Klingons left us a third-rate power.<eos> My people had lost their way.<eos> I've made them strong again.<eos> At what price?<eos> You sold Cardassia to the Dominion.<eos> Yes... a high price, to be sure. But look what we're getting in return.<eos> The Alpha Quadrant itself.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
- They're not saying.<eos> One minute, 15 seconds.<eos> Can we punch a hole in the security net?<eos> - lt will take a few minutes.<eos> - We don't have a few minutes.<eos> Can we disable the power generator?<eos> - The explosion will do that.<eos> - That won't help us.<eos> - One minute.<eos> - Maybe it will.
Rest.<eos> For five minutes, and from here on in you can take a 15-minute break every hour.<eos> Doctor's orders.<eos> Was that the best you have to offer?<eos> He was our youngest and least experienced.<eos> I promise your next opponent will provide more of a challenge.<eos> View's even better from Upper Pylon 2.<eos> I keep hoping that the wormhole will open.<eos> That Garak's runabout will come through and everything will be all right again.<eos> Maybe it will.
I have to look out for my bar.<eos> And I have to look out for you.<eos> Me?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> Whatever happens, we belong together.<eos> Well, like I said, you're an idiot.<eos> On screen, Captain.<eos> General Martok, take a defensive position near the Defiant.<eos> They have to finish deploying those mines no matter the cost.<eos> And they will.
Unlike some, we don't lock people away to punish them.<eos> You'll be released... once you've undergone the engramatic purge.<eos> The what?<eos> It's a medical procedure that will identify and remove the offending images from your mind.<eos> Captain!<eos> Once identified, the images can be removed from Frane's mind as well.<eos> Memory extraction... that's a dangerous procedure.<eos> There is a risk of neurological damage, but it's necessary for us to treat Frane.<eos> Will you at least delay the procedure until we've had a chance to review the evidence?<eos> Will you?
You should see my place.<eos> They haven't looked as bad since my old Academy days.<eos> Is there something on your mind?<eos> Yes, but you're not going to like it.<eos> That's never stopped you before.<eos> Broken.<eos> I'll be blunt.<eos> Our strategy's failing.<eos> It was a good idea to try and create temporal shielding, but it isn't working.<eos> Not yet, but it will.
I'll give them a good scolding.<eos> People are saying you play favorite at school.<eos> You're spoiling your kids.<eos> You can't tell'em apart.<eos> They sneak around all over, like little monsters.<eos> They're little imps, those twins!<eos> Close the door, Kazuya.<eos> Hey, mind the fire!<eos> The water's lukewarm!<eos> We will.
- And maybe some chicks, too.<eos> - This is gonna be cool.<eos> You know what sucks?<eos> We never scored and we never got any money.<eos> - And my butt's still sore ...<eos> - Butt-head, look!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> You think we're ever gonna score?<eos> I probably will.
One more word out of you and you're outta here.<eos> I'm going into Chambers house to find the body.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> -You can't do that, man.<eos> I'll say it again, I'm going in.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> -How do you know he's not in there?<eos> -'Cos I saw him leave.<eos> What if he comes back while we're in there?<eos> He won't.
He fuckin' with the wrong motherfucker.<eos> You don't fuck with me!<eos> - I will kill that motherfucker--"<eos> - Baby, baby, baby, baby.<eos> - I get the point. It was-<eos> - That was-- - You liked it?<eos> I mean, it touched me in a... really... special place.<eos> Look.<eos> You wait right here.<eos> I sure will.
It doesn't matter.<eos> No one is getting in here, Steven.<eos> You designed it, remember?<eos> Reinforced doors.<eos> No entry without the code.<eos> Dad?<eos> David's got the code.<eos> It all could've been different, Mr. Walker.<eos> You should've allowed nature to take its course.<eos> In the end it will anyway.
Everything is under control.<eos> I want you to both move over against that wall.<eos> This is an arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, we will provide an attorney for you... because we provide things for you people all the-<eos> Oh! That really hurt.<eos> I can't follow your fickle little moods all over the place.<eos> - That has got to change.<eos> - Okay, I will.
- Baby now!<eos> - Ray, it's time to go.<eos> - Do you take Visa?<eos> Take it!<eos> What were you thinking tonight, watching them go through that?<eos> I was thinking, "I hope he doesn't get injured."<eos> Sometimes I can't tell at all what's going on in that head of yours.<eos> - And I don't know your noises yet.<eos> - Well, when you wonder, ask me.<eos> Okay, I will.
You know all right.<eos> At my place.<eos> Go, I'll call her.<eos> She won't forgive you.<eos> You could have come home.<eos> With a face like minced meat, it would have scared you.<eos> And I wasn't scared now?<eos> I was thoughtless.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I won't.
My son is in prison in town.<eos> I brought money to buy my son back... but the Commander was afraid to take it.<eos> I'll trade these Russians... for my son... in two days.<eos> Don't let them... pull a fast one on you.<eos> It's better... if you kill them.<eos> If they try to trick me, I'll suck their blood.<eos> Sergeant?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Who will want to buy us?<eos> You? Nobody will.
A poison.<eos> Another cruel trick to take his life and leave you behind to suffer.<eos> It was the only way he could devise to set you free.<eos> It was inevitable from the moment I found how to achieve what I'd always wanted.<eos> To be the knife as well as the wound.<eos> Would you have ever forgiven me?<eos> I wanted the night you see.<eos> And here it is.<eos> You said you didn't care what the world thought of you.<eos> Nor will I.
then the whole world goes... bang!<eos> Don't go away.<eos> The plunder, Patrick.<eos> Which is half mine.<eos> Don't need to remind me.<eos> Where are you going to cash it?<eos> An old friend.<eos> One I've trusted long before our acquaintance.<eos> - Oh, I'll go with you.<eos> - No, you won't.
You've got everything you need.<eos> Antonia will explain.<eos> What am I supposed to tell people?<eos> No one will ask.<eos> Not even Maria?<eos> Her least of all.<eos> Your maid is right. You need medical help.<eos> I'm afraid I do.<eos> I expect we won't meet again.<eos> Of course we will.
- I want $10,000 to keep quiet.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> I will go to Niagara Falls and tell him.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> - Ten thousand dollars.<eos> - I'II get it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Knowing G'Kar, once he hears this, he'll return to Narn at once.<eos> But how?<eos> You know every ship going to Narn is searched.<eos> Vir, we're talking about G'Kar here.<eos> He is annoying but extremely capable.<eos> He will find a way.<eos> And when he arrives, he will attempt to free her and my forces will be there to arrest him.<eos> No, no, no. It won't work, Londo.<eos> He'll never believe me.<eos> Yes, he will.
After the Narns were defeated, I took steps to put some distance between us.<eos> Refa, I have the feeling that he and his associates... are carving a great, dark hole in the middle of the universe.<eos> And when they go down, anyone nearby will go with them.<eos> That will not happen.<eos> You don't appreciate their strength.<eos> I appreciate their strength, all right.<eos> And that is why this unfocused aggression worries me.<eos> By drawing our forces into a dozen smaller wars... you have effectively weakened our main line of defense... should they turn an eye to Centauri Prime.<eos> - They will not do that.<eos> - No, they will not.
- Belay that order.<eos> Standing by.<eos> Ivanova, don't do it.<eos> Don't throw your career away on this!<eos> He's not worth it.<eos> If he gets on board, all of our careers are finished anyway... yours, mine, everything we've worked for.<eos> Susan, we have got it covered.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> Delenn's plan will work.<eos> No, it won't.
Ambassador Delenn just got back.<eos> She's looking forward to talking to you about everything that's happened.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> I just saw a report on ISN.<eos> Four of the five cruisers that defected with Gen. Hague have been shot down.<eos> They say he is on the run... and they expect to capture him next time he comes out of hyperspace.<eos> Well, he won't go down without a fight.<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, he won't.
And that's why I took your card.<eos> Don't send me away, Steve.<eos> I couldn't bear it.<eos> You give her whatever she needs for as long as she needs it.<eos> All right?<eos> - You're sure you're all right?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Well, I'd still like you to stop by Medlab and let them take a look at you.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
What are you doing?<eos> What are you taking a shower over here for?<eos> He came home from work, and we were here... and you know your brother, he doesn't like to be alone in the house.<eos> -Could we go now?<eos> I'm cold.<eos> -Sure. Come on, let's go.<eos> That's my towel.<eos> But we can get it later.<eos> -I'll patch the shower up for you tomorrow.<eos> -Of course you will.
Like "That would be an ecumenical matter."<eos> Yes, any religious question can be answered by that.<eos> That's what I always say.<eos> That's the great thing about Catholicism.<eos> It's so vague, nobody knows what it's all about.<eos> I think it might work, Dougal.<eos> I know it'll work.<eos> It WILL work!<eos> It won't work, will it, Ted?<eos> It won't, no.
Bernie.<eos> Look who's eating at 6:00.<eos> Your suddenly well-to-do president.<eos> You enjoy your last meal in office.<eos> Tomorrow, when they kick you out you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.<eos> They're not kicking me out.<eos> You don't have the votes.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
-Oh, hi, lan.<eos> -lan.<eos> -lan.<eos> -lan.<eos> He's a friend of mine from England.<eos> So tell me, how are you doing?<eos> Well, I'm working over at The Andover Shop, actually.<eos> You should come by.<eos> I'll get you a great discount.<eos> Maybe I will.
I can't stand it.<eos> After the court-martial's over, I'm definitely signing up for the next mining expedition to the Gamma Quadrant.<eos> Maybe there won't be a court-martial.<eos> You're right.<eos> None of us may get out of here alive.<eos> No, I mean Starfleet could decide to send you to counseling instead.<eos> I won't go.<eos> I don't deserve to be in Starfleet.<eos> Therapy won't change what I did.<eos> Nothing will.
It worked for one Klingon officer I know.<eos> Yes, but I doubt Kurn would be interested in joining Starfleet.<eos> Well, there is another security force on the station.<eos> Well, your brother's had an interesting career with the Klingon Defense Forces, Mr. Worf.<eos> I have just one question:<eos> Does he know how to use the stun setting on a disruptor?<eos> Nonlethal skills are not valued in the Empire.<eos> They are among my deputies.<eos> And if your brother is going to be a member of my detachment he's going to have to make some adjustments in his thinking.<eos> He will.
We go back exactly the way we came in.<eos> And we hope that whatever doorway we came through is still there.<eos> If it is, we'll try goin' through.<eos> I'm going forward.<eos> Do you wanna come?<eos> No, I'll stay with her.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, we've still got a dinner date. You haven't forgotten, have you? No.<eos> I haven't.<eos> And I won't.

Fuckin' thief!<eos> ...that terrible Japanese radiation... and help you if you suffer from... arthritis, rickets, impotence.<eos> You coward, you'll never change!<eos> All you do is beat up on women and drunks!<eos> Well now, Sheriff.<eos> That's a nasty accusation.<eos> Buy them and your children will be protected against... the mysterious influence of those Japanese.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> No.<eos> - When will you?
Get up, you big heap of...<eos> - It's good to see ye again.<eos> - Aye, welcome home.<eos> - Look what you did to my head.<eos> - You should have moved.<eos> William, will you dance with me?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> I've come to claim the right of primae noctis.<eos> As lord of these lands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the first night of her union.<eos> By God you will not!
Wait.<eos> I respect what you said. But remember that these men have lands and castles.<eos> It's much to risk.<eos> And the common man that bleeds in battle, does he risk less?<eos> No. But from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.<eos> Its nobles share allegiance with England.<eos> - Its clans war with each other.<eos> - Aye.<eos> If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.<eos> - We all will.
I cannot be King.<eos> You and you alone can rule Scotland.<eos> What I tell you, you must do.<eos> Not for me, not for yourself, but for your country.<eos> Right, lads, make way. Coming through.<eos> Make way, lads.<eos> - The Bruce is not coming, William.<eos> - He'll come.<eos> Mornay and Lochlan have come.<eos> So will the Bruce.
Sure you can.<eos> You can get tickets anytime.<eos> Is that so? Not around here, you can't.<eos> From this moment on, you will not drive, sit... do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver present.<eos> No cruising around with Dionne, all right?<eos> Two permits do not equal a license.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Yes, Daddy.<eos> I expect you to become a good driver. I wanna see you apply yourself.<eos> - I will.
- Are you sure you don't want it?<eos> - It might stunt my growth.<eos> And I wanna be 5'10" like Cindy Crawford.<eos> I thought maybe you or Miss Geist might like it.<eos> Maybe you could share it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Miss Geist.<eos> - Hi, girls.<eos> Did you sign up for the environmental fair?<eos> - Yeah, we will.
- Every day.<eos> -Workin' on an album?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I should do some backup.<eos> Good idea.<eos> You haven't come to hear me.<eos> Why is that?<eos> - I will if you want.<eos> - It'd be great if you did.<eos> -Well, I will then.
Drop the bat. Let's go!<eos> Just let me smash this ball downtown, okay?<eos> All right. You got 10 seconds.<eos> Otherwise, the game is going to be called on account of bloodshed!<eos> Come on, Frankie.<eos> I got to go to Staten Island.<eos> Staten Island?<eos> What about camp?<eos> You'll miss the bus!<eos> I won't.
Don't joke.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I'm not joking.<eos> That's why I sent the bus ahead without us.<eos> Liar.<eos> - How much you want to bet?<eos> - Fifty bucks.<eos> - Okay. So I didn't send the bus.<eos> - Cough it up.<eos> But I will.
Slow night for you, right?<eos> I wish I had the penicillin concession in your apartment.<eos> I'd- - I'd be wealthy.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you're gonna call me again?<eos> Am I gonna call you again?<eos> Yeah, I'll call you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - I will.
For God's sake.<eos> There's enough black sheep in our family to fill a field.<eos> Whoring and swindling and...<eos> But Will isn't one of them.<eos> And as for your wife, Kitty,<eos> - and her tribe...<eos> - Bess, what is this for?<eos> Let me go too.<eos> To find him.<eos> No. You will not.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.<eos> Would you like the address?<eos> Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You stay there yourself, this pension?<eos> Yeah, sometimes.<eos> I know the old lady.<eos> You stay there.<eos> Tell her my name.<eos> I will.
I know the truth.<eos> Sorry, Saul. You now, you do-- You don't have to worry, 'cause I'm gonna tell them everything.<eos> Don't tell them a thing.<eos> Remember the day you said you'd-- you'd never do anything to hurt the family? - Yeah? - Well, since they met you, they figure they have Peter back.<eos> Now, if you tell them the truth, eh, it'll take him away again.<eos> They need you, Lucy.<eos> Just like you need them. Now, look, I know you're a good girl.<eos> And I know you'll do the right thing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah. Yes, you will.
Why is that?<eos> If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing. You know, a hook.<eos> Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.<eos> So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake." Crazy Snake Man.<eos> Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies.<eos> Kids will run past my place!<eos> "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!<eos> You've got to get over this.<eos> You won't end up alone.<eos> Of course I will.
Thank you. Uh...<eos> So who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?<eos> Look, I, uh...<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> I gotta go. I'll miss the last train.<eos> No, I don't want you taking that thing this late.<eos> - Where am I gonna stay?<eos> Here? - Whoa.<eos> We'll go to a hotel.<eos> - No, you won't.
Nothing!<eos> -I saw my name.<eos> What is it?<eos> -No, no, see?<eos> See? It's printing!<eos> It's printing!<eos> Let me see!<eos> Hey, someone order a coat?<eos> Chandler wrote something about me and won't let me see.<eos> He won't?
Do you think I would lie about a thing like that?<eos> It's not something I'm proud of.<eos> I don't like explosions going off on my station, Garak.<eos> Innocent people could have been hurt.<eos> You could have been killed. Now if there's anything you know you're not telling us I suggest you start talking.<eos> I've told you everything I can think of.<eos> All right, then.<eos> I'll investigate the "leads" you've given us.<eos> If there's anyone else you think I should talk to, let me know.<eos> I certainly will.
Throw all we have at Terok Nor and rip it to pieces.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Following your suggestion wouldn't help and would result in a loss of life.<eos> Easy to say.<eos> Those Cardassian pigs didn't kill your brother.<eos> We've all suffered losses.<eos> Logic dictates caution in the face of a superior enemy.<eos> Logic won't win us our freedom.<eos> We have to take action.<eos> And we will.
Remind him where he belongs.<eos> - What about Sisko?<eos> - Take me to the lntendant's quarters.<eos> She'll decide what to do with me.<eos> - Of all the impudent...<eos> - Do as he says.<eos> Intendant, I demand that this man be...<eos> You... demand?<eos> You promised me he'd die.<eos> And he will...
I guess she thinks a steak dinner is supposed to impress us.<eos> Does she really think a steak dinner will impress us?<eos> The Second Impact generation has really cheap standards.<eos> She can't help it.<eos> What was with that fake cheer you made?<eos> I just wanted to make her feel a little easier about it.<eos> Now, since she's going to treat us,<eos> I'd better figure out where to go.<eos> You've got to join us this time.<eos> No, I won't.
Berra.<eos> - That was a pretty big miss.<eos> - Are you going now?<eos> - I can wait.<eos> - Klas-Göran.<eos> - Now?<eos> - I might have a stomach-ache...<eos> - What a chicken!<eos> - You'll see if I'm scared!<eos> Yeah, we will.
- You think?<eos> - The headlight's busted.<eos> - Oh, who cares?<eos> Show me your feet.<eos> Take off your shoes.<eos> I knew it.<eos> They'd fit.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Perfectly!<eos> - What will?
Give me a push while you're back there.<eos> Alrighty, then!<eos> It's alive!<eos> It's alive!<eos> My little baby, come here.<eos> You missed Mommy, didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Did Daddy hurt you?<eos> I won't let him.<eos> No, I won't.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!<eos> Don't move! Don't fucking move!<eos> Get the phone.<eos> Hello, Mr. Escobar?<eos> Pablo Milar, the president's executive secretary.<eos> We've been trying to reach you for hours. We've had a storm.<eos> All electricity and phones were out.<eos> Could you hold for the president, please?<eos> The president?<eos> Yes, of course I will.
- Follow me, please.<eos> - We've tested your free sample and decided we want more.<eos> There's only one way you're gonna get more.<eos> Your price is rather large.<eos> So are the results.<eos> Good evening, everyone.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> I'm only interested in long-term investments.<eos> What happens when the DEA replaces their dead agents?<eos> And they will.
Listen, you want to have a good think about this.<eos> If Wellington finds out, you're done for.<eos> You know what he says.<eos> Duels are forbidden. Huh?<eos> How well did you get to know this Marquesa, anyhow?<eos> - Don't you start!<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I'll kill the Marqués.<eos> And when I find his bloody Marquesa, I'll kill hen<eos> - Of course you will, sir.
Why not go bowling?<eos> I opened all my books.<eos> -Maybe.<eos> Do you have a coin? -Yes. Flip it.<eos> Tails is bowling.<eos> Heads is penal code.<eos> Tails.<eos> Bowling.<eos> I'll work for an hour, then I'll call you.<eos> Or I will.
Put on some gloves.<eos> I couldn't find them.<eos> I have plenty.<eos> Why didn't you bring them?<eos> We can't do it without arguing.<eos> Then use mine.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> Mine are all mixed up.<eos> - Well, go and get them.<eos> - All right, I will.
Are you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Look after the house while I'm away.<eos> Sky!<eos> Bugs!<eos> Sun!<eos> - Grandma!<eos> - What?<eos> People will think we're crazy.<eos> They really will.
Na'Toth, you never answered my question.<eos> - Where is Ambassador G'Kar?<eos> - I've told you all I know.<eos> He left to investigate the attack on our base in Quadrant 37.<eos> You've had no word from him since?<eos> Ambassador G'Kar is more than able to take care of himself.<eos> Stay together.<eos> A little further to the gate.<eos> - We're not going to make it.<eos> - Yes, we will.
I thought the injection wouldn't wear off for another day.<eos> Another day?<eos> It's been 72 hours since you were knocked out.<eos> You missed your deadline.<eos> To make up for it, I deposited a great deal of money to your account.<eos> No!<eos> The Thenta Makur...<eos> They'll think I betrayed my commission, sold out our principles.<eos> They will kill me.<eos> Yes, they will, won't they?
Bilateral hemothorax.<eos> We got a liter out of the left already.<eos> Dr. Benton, that Russian is screaming for you.<eos> He insists only you sew him up.<eos> -l can't get a pulse.<eos> -Carter, go take care of Ivan.<eos> I'm putting in this stitch.<eos> -A bullet in the right ventricle.<eos> -Tamponade. I'll crack his chest.<eos> No, you won't.
You did?<eos> I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<eos> I did.<eos> Listen, do you think..?<eos> Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.<eos> Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!<eos> Ugly naked dancing!<eos> It's nice that he has someone.<eos> Shall I carve?<eos> - By all means.<eos> - All right.<eos> Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?<eos> I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.<eos> - Does anybody wanna split this?<eos> - I will.
What happened, big guy?<eos> Big guy?<eos> It felt like a "big guy" moment.<eos> I got fired!<eos> They said I acted too much with it.<eos> I told everybody about this!<eos> -Everybody's expecting to see me.<eos> -lKnow what?<eos> -No one will be able to tell.<eos> -My mom will.
Who are we kidding?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> It's true.<eos> You can't do the switch.<eos> Nobody can do the switch.<eos> It was a stupid idea to begin with.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> I'm stuck with the non-laugher, and that's that.<eos> - We'll come up with something.<eos> - Yeah. Sure we will.
- Me too.<eos> We should get ready for the Festival.<eos> - The babysitter will be here any minute.<eos> - Ah, the Festival.<eos> On the other hand... we could spend the rest of the day locked away in our quarters.<eos> What I really want to do is sleep.<eos> Then maybe you should.<eos> I just meant I could use some.<eos> That's OK. lf you need to sleep, go ahead. I'll understand.<eos> No, you won't.
Consider the cloaking device a gift.<eos> Ferengis aren't known for their generosity.<eos> We are a deeply misunderstood race.<eos> You've saved our lives.<eos> Our movement owes you.<eos> I know how you can repay me.<eos> Convince Natima to stay here.<eos> - She will never agree to stay behind.<eos> - No Natima, no cloaking device, and no way off this station.<eos> - She won't.
But that doesn't mean we aren't close.<eos> I never told you this, Odo, but you're as dear to me as my brother.<eos> And I've seen how well you treat him.<eos> Odo, look at me.<eos> Look at me - l'm on my knees.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I don't care why you do it.<eos> Pick any reason you want, but please let Natima and the others go.<eos> - l'll do it.<eos> - You will?
Maybe one day I'll come back and we'll be together, but not until my work is done.<eos> So I just have to wait until Cardassia becomes free and democratic?<eos> I promise... I'll make it worth the wait.<eos> I can't come with you?<eos> No. lt's not your fight.<eos> And I couldn't bear it if something happened to you.<eos> I need to know that you're here, safe.<eos> That way a part of me will always be safe too.<eos> I love you, Quark.<eos> I always will.
Good morning.<eos> I thought you'd sleep till noon.<eos> Sh.<eos> You're supposed to be relaxing.<eos> I'm very relaxed.<eos> Good.<eos> How are you feeling this morning?<eos> Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.
Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.<eos> I'll stay a few more days.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because in two days you are going to be elected Kai.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> There's no guarantee I'll win.<eos> Of course you will.
I don't know. I... I could do a planetary survey.<eos> Not bad.<eos> - All right.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Really?<eos> It will be like a working vacation.<eos> That's great!<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> - We'll have a great time.<eos> - We will.
Tintin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Whatever you two decide.<eos> Mister Switzerland!<eos> - If the radio doesn't work, we...<eos> - I'm not climbing those mountains!<eos> Then I'll go without you.<eos> You'll die.<eos> You'll freeze to death.<eos> No, I won't.
Once upon a time...<eos> At the end of the 20th century...<eos> Children of Sun!<eos> For how long should we suffer?<eos> Our ancestors wanted us to find our land and turn it into the blooming garden.<eos> Here's our land!<eos> Here are our children!<eos> And this is the steel!<eos> - Let us protect our land!<eos> - We will!

If that turd Daniel Madigan can move through parallel worlds, so can I.<eos> In, steal whatever I want, and out again.<eos> Impossible to catch.<eos> If God was a villain he would be me.<eos> - You want me to vacuum now? - No.<eos> But the pool needs attention.<eos> Very good.<eos> Do not move.<eos> - All right, I will go quietly.<eos> - The hell you will.
He's never been away from me.<eos> There's nothing I can do here now except wait... for lawyers to talk to lawyers to talk to lawyers.<eos> Maybe it's the time I need to think about what to do with the rest of my life.<eos> Without me?<eos> I love you, Lisa.<eos> You'd better.<eos> It's just for a couple of weeks.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> What if they decide Jesse is this reincarnation?<eos> They never will.
What are you talking about?<eos> Of course we're going.<eos> That's what we've worked so hard for.<eos> If I win...<eos> Everybody will say, "Well, of course he won.<eos> He's a top-ranked player."<eos> But if I lose...<eos> You won't lose, Josh.<eos> What if I do?<eos> You won't.
- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.<eos> - You'll see her disappointed look.<eos> - Harold ran off with the secretary.<eos> - Until Irene had the dog put down.<eos> Your brother Dennis is professor at Johns Hopkins.<eos> - He's married to...<eos> Betsy.<eos> - The most competitive woman ever.<eos> - How will I remember all this?<eos> - Walter, you will!
You want a fruit plate?<eos> I'd rather die than eat airplane food.<eos> I'll write you're 12.<eos> That way you can fly unaccompanied.<eos> - Who'd believe I'm 12?<eos> - They'll believe the computer.<eos> I'll say you're short for your age, but that they shouldn't mention it.<eos> Great idea!<eos> - You'll miss the train.<eos> - No I won't.
What did I tell you?<eos> At least he tried to escape.<eos> He didn't just wait for them.<eos> - Heil Hitler.<eos> - Heil Hitler.<eos> Gestapo.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, they haven't caught us, have they?<eos> Well, they will.
Uhh! making his head more vulnerable.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Good one, good one.<eos> Never be caught against the ropes.<eos> Thank you, Herr Berger.<eos> You've been most helpful.<eos> Go to hell, traitor.<eos> I am not a traitor.<eos> I just wised up.<eos> You will, too.
Are you kidding man, he loves you.<eos> You don't think I'm kissing his ass, do you?<eos> You're saying what he wants to hear.<eos> That ain't the same as kissing his ass.<eos> I saw Coming Home in a Body Bag, I loved it, I'm not lying to him.<eos> No, that's why it's not ass-kissing.<eos> What you're doing is genuine. And he knows it.<eos> I like you, Clarence.<eos> Always have.<eos> Always will.
Depends.<eos> You have to think of them real hard.<eos> Like me, I come back.<eos> All the time.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tell Maurice I love him.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Okay, I will.<eos> I will.
You beat him so badly he has to be taken away in an ambulance.<eos> So he goes to the hospital, you go to juvie, and your mom takes off.<eos> You know that love that you talked about at dinner?<eos> You're never gonna have that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Your story isn't gonna end any differently than your parents' did.<eos> Jade will get bored with you.<eos> Just like your mom got bored.<eos> And how are you going to handle yourself when that happens again, David? Huh?<eos> Because it will.
-Arrest him.<eos> You think?<eos> -He would arrest you too, if he'd be on your place.<eos> Possibly they done it intentionally, to check me. It's even worse!<eos> It may turned, that I recepted him like a President.<eos> With white gloves, red carpet and pioneers. Živadin will betray me first.<eos> He hardly waits to put ass in my armchair.<eos> You must prove to comrades, that you're through with family.<eos> Report him.<eos> -And I will.
I could do it.<eos> I know I could do it.<eos> Jerry, we're friends.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> It would ruin our friendship.<eos> Oh, friendship.<eos> Friendship, schmiendship.<eos> -No, that's important to me.<eos> -We won't ruin the friendship.<eos> -Yes, we will.
The passion.<eos> The forbidden pleasure.<eos> You had an affair with Gandhi?<eos> He used to dip his bald head in oil and he'd rub it all over my body.<eos> Here.<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The Mahatma?<eos> We're supposed to be looking for the old man.<eos> Oh, we will. We will.
- I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.<eos> - Shut up, the both of you.<eos> You're making me nervous.<eos> Where is he already?<eos> He should've been out of work by now.<eos> Hey, this is kind of fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe we ought to become private detectives.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should.<eos> - Maybe I will.
I was worried.<eos> is he alone?<eos> I think Minister Toran is in there.<eos> Even better.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> There were 4 7 other people on that moon.<eos> They all left willingly.<eos> How do we know?<eos> They just obeyed the order to leave.<eos> - So will he.
But there is nothing to talk about.<eos> - You used to tell Curzon everything.<eos> - Not everything.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> - lt's because I'm a woman, isn't it?<eos> - Don't be ridiculous.<eos> It's hard to talk man-to-man with a woman.<eos> - That has nothing to do with it.<eos> - Then tell me what's going on.<eos> I will.
- Protect me?<eos> From those who are jealous and wish to take your place.<eos> They can be very dangerous.<eos> - How do I stop them?<eos> - Leave it to me.<eos> I'm not going to allow anybody to harm such a grateful friend as yourself.<eos> How grateful am I?<eos> You'll make sure I have my pick of the most lucrative Gamma Quadrant opportunities.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
Of course, you do.<eos> It's only natural.<eos> No one is going to blame you for that.<eos> But in order to lose those doubts to keep fear and confusion away<eos> I need you to remain linked to the others so that their strength and their confidence can help you.<eos> I need you, Goval.<eos> I need you to help me build a future for the Borg.<eos> I can't do it without you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
Nothing?<eos> - We call her in for questioning.<eos> She's got enough money to burn the department down...<eos> She was the last person seen with the guy.<eos> I'll take the responsibility.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It won't do any good.<eos> She'll just waltz in with some superstar lawyer... who'll get us all canned for wasting the taxpayers' money.<eos> - That's exactly what she'll do.<eos> - No, she won't.
Is there anyone you can call?<eos> The only one is dying!<eos> And your fiancé?<eos> The dress is for a friend!<eos> Now get me out of here!<eos> You've fucked us over!<eos> Do you realize what you've done?<eos> Do you?<eos> Calm down!<eos> No, I won't!
God forgive me, I do!<eos> I want to be what you are. See what you see.<eos> Love what you love.<eos> To walk with me, you must die from this life and be reborn to mine.<eos> You are my love and my life always.<eos> Then I give you life eternal.<eos> Everlasting love.<eos> The power of the storm and the beasts of the earth.<eos> Walk with me to be my loving wife forever.<eos> I will!
- Lellen!<eos> Lellen, what's the size of your shoes?<eos> - 44!<eos> Fine, stay at home, will you.<eos> Now we'll buy Lippy some damn fine shoes.<eos> - Do you know the count?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> Couldn't you ask him?<eos> About the place ...<eos> I will, some day.
Is this you?<eos> This gas-guzzIing monster is you?<eos> The environmentalist?<eos> -I inherited it from my dad.<eos> -I'm not sure how I feel about that.<eos> Let's maybe do something this weekend or--<eos> Okay.<eos> -I'II call you.<eos> -Don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Got it.<eos> Diane, you've moved that clock 12 inches to the left.<eos> Ah, yes, another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper.<eos> And now, Diane, you must clean the coffee cups, get fresh ground coffee from Sally, and make a damn great pot of coffee.<eos> Well, Agent Desmond wanted to check out the trailer court one more time.<eos> He asked me to drive the van with the body back to Portland, which I did.<eos> It was 105 miles. Anything else?<eos> Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?<eos> Stanley, I'm up to speed. Agent Desmond never did explain to me what the Blue Rose meant.<eos> Neither will I. Well, all right.
What?<eos> Can you hold this for me?<eos> Just for a minute?<eos> - Why?<eos> There's a call for me.<eos> I'm holding it for Flosi.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> - I won't be a second.<eos> No.<eos> - You won't?
Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a lil' ol' biscuit?<eos> Can I slog off school tomorrow?<eos> Got a pain in me gulliver.<eos> I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock!<eos> Oh, see you later, kids.<eos> I've got to go rehearse with Ned.<eos> But, Marge, what about dessert?<eos> For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!<eos> Fine.<eos> I will!
Pick me.<eos> Pick me, pick me.<eos> I pick Ken GriffeyJr.<eos> Aw, geez.<eos> Okay, I'll take Millhouse.<eos> Mr. Boggs, will you be on my team?<eos> You got yourself a player.<eos> Damn!<eos> All right, I'll take Louis.<eos> I'll takeJose Canseco. D'oh!
I had to see you.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me.<eos> - Soren.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're my friend, and I thought...<eos> I don't know. I thought I should tell you.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Nothing will change between us, will it?<eos> Of course it will.
You have to burn the doll.<eos> What?<eos> If you don't burn it...<eos> Satomi, behind you!<eos> Turn the light on!<eos> Quick!<eos> Don't do that... lt sounded real, Etsuko!<eos> About the doll...<eos> You should ask your mum.<eos> I will.
But you'll never never reach a man's soul through a lens.<eos> That rather depends which end of the microscope you're on, doesn't it.<eos> Stop him!<eos> Boys! Get my feet, quickly!<eos> Get my feet! Get my feet! My feet!<eos> You idiots! Get up and stop this!<eos> Where've you been?<eos> - Just behind you.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> - No, but I will.
When I was nine, both my parents were murdered.<eos> I saw it done.<eos> The man who killed them wore the tattoo of the Iron Claw.<eos> I saw him as he killed my parents.<eos> I struck him in the face with his own sword.<eos> It was Yoshida.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> I'm partner with a homicidal maniac on a vendetta of family vengeance.<eos> I'll tell Nelson this isn't working out and get you reassigned.<eos> Like hell you will.
He's all alone and you have to protect him.<eos> I know.<eos> You tell me how I'm supposed to do that.<eos> He doesn't even believe me anymore.<eos> - I've lost him.<eos> - You're strong, Sarah.<eos> Stronger than you ever thought you could be.<eos> On your feet, soldier!<eos> I love you, Sarah.<eos> I always will.
Call him? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.<eos> Will I be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ah! The newspaper.<eos> This is Darryl.<eos> I have a collect call from Thelma.<eos> Will you accept?<eos> Why, yes, I will, operator.
- Here, in my flat ?<eos> !<eos> - Aye !<eos> As large as life !<eos> Urrrgh !<eos> There we are. The last brick.<eos> Safe at last !<eos> I never thought we'd get away with it !<eos> Put it right there, old pal !<eos> No, I will not !
But I do like the fear I'm feeling.<eos> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth wood upon the earth.<eos> But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord:<eos> in thee is my trust; leave not my...<eos> Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.<eos> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.<eos> - He'll come for me.<eos> - No, he won't.
Don't.<eos> Oh, I wanna hold you.<eos> I wanna go back.<eos> - God, if you'd just...<eos> - Please, don't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Have you told her?<eos> - God, no.<eos> Never.<eos> I never will.
- Please.<eos> - Evelyn.<eos> Give me the gun, Evelyn.<eos> - Evelyn, give me the gun. - No.<eos> - Evelyn, give me the gun.<eos> - No.<eos> Evelyn.<eos> Evelyn.<eos> I can't do this, Malcolm.<eos> Then I will.
Just look at the X-rays!<eos> You see that dark spot there?<eos> Whiplash.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> And this smudge that looks like my fingerprint? No.<eos> That's trauma!<eos> -Am I going to die?<eos> -Yes, son!<eos> Homer!<eos> No, of course you won't.
I brought you something that is yours, I got in the car.<eos> Now I will.<eos> I have to go running.<eos> Well...<eos> I imagine that the illusion you have done your sister.<eos> Well, it is almost has not seen the poor asleep because it takes all afternoon.<eos> Come on, Mom, get down to the cafeteria before closing.<eos> - If you have no appetite.<eos> - Come, woman.<eos> Down together, will you?
Wait'll they take that big sharp thing and stick you with it.<eos> I hope they don't stick me today.<eos> She'll be knocked out from the shot so no operating heavy machinery.<eos> I'm only 1, and I know that's not funny.<eos> What's that?<eos> I can't watch this part.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Smarts, does it? Hurts just a little?<eos> Will this pain ever go away? !<eos> Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.
They may be able to break through the door.<eos> We'll be cornered down there.<eos> - There's still some way to escape.<eos> - A way out is a way in.<eos> The windows!<eos> - We can board them up. - There's no time...<eos> There's only three of them.<eos> I've handled more by myself.<eos> - The cellar door won't hold them.<eos> - But the windows will?
Where's the way out?<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> -Who're these shits?<eos> Nobody move! It's okay!<eos> The hell it is!<eos> Nothing's okay!<eos> Open the door!<eos> I can't open it.<eos> Tell them to open the door!<eos> They won't.
And they don't have fun, even when they do the till.<eos> Do the cousins make you fantasize?<eos> Imagine, on a Christmas Eve,<eos> The husbands somewhat deserted but satisfied.<eos> The lame dresses, the shoes which squeeze feet. The children well polished silverware too-<eos> I, nostalgic:<eos> "Hey, cousins Do you still play with the safety pins?"<eos> What if I go and see them again?<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> You won't!
What's with the tablecloths?<eos> The critic has spoken.<eos> I feel like a fool.<eos> Norma, pick your lower lip up off the floor.<eos> It wasn't that bad.<eos> Mother, please don't tell me how to feel.<eos> This business is all I've got.<eos> I wanna keep my regular customers.<eos> I don't care if anyone new ever comes in here again.<eos> They probably won't.
I don't want to have any secrets from you.<eos> I don't want there to be any lies between us.<eos> Secrets kill people's happiness.<eos> I don't want us to be like that.<eos> We won't.<eos> We won't be.<eos> We have to do what's right.<eos> What you said yesterday was true.<eos> If we don't find out what happened to Laura, it won't go away, our whole lives.<eos> We will, James.
It's a nice feeling, you know?<eos> Entry code accepted.<eos> Please enter data.<eos> Shuttles are programmed to arrive at Galactic Mining headquarters airport at 0200 hours.<eos> Do you want to change destination?<eos> Enter new destination now.<eos> Mining shuttle 117 commencing liftoff.<eos> What are you doing there, curly?<eos> I'll be needing that.<eos> Like hell you will!
I brought you a little souvenir.<eos> It's great, Doc.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Brown, I brought this note back from the future... and now it's erased.<eos> Of course it's erased.<eos> What does that mean ?<eos> It means your future hasn't been written yet.<eos> No one's has.<eos> Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one, both of you.<eos> We will, Doc !
Where they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Well, they do for now.<eos> We'll finish it tomorrow night.<eos> Don't go.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I miss my mother.<eos> Oh, honey, I know you do.<eos> Will I ever see her again?<eos> Of course you will.
- Hello.<eos> - You'll thank me later.<eos> - Endorse it "Rita Miller."<eos> - I know!<eos> Make it out to St Joseph's Shelter.<eos> I don't believe you're making me do this!<eos> - Give it to her.<eos> - I just want to feel it in my fingers.<eos> - Just give her the cheque!<eos> - I will!

Germany, Europe... the fourth child of Azriel Perel... a shoe store owner, and his wife Rebecca.<eos> I was born on April 20, 1925, in Peine, Germany, Europe.<eos> You won't believe it... but I remember my circumcision.<eos> My God, God of our forefathers... let this child live this child...<eos> Solomon.<eos> Solomon, son of Azriel.<eos> I remember that my birthday fell on the same day... as that of the future Chancellor of the Thousand-year Reich...<eos> Adolf Hitler.<eos> Maybe Father wanted to shave his beard.<eos> Not now he won't.
- Leave us alone!<eos> - Nazi, go home! Nazi, go home!<eos> - Go, go, go. Come on. Come on.<eos> You must be elated this morning.<eos> Old man in a Bears cap, his arm around his grandson... being threatened by a screaming mob.<eos> A jury will love it.<eos> I think he should be shot for taking Mikey over there.<eos> What jury?<eos> I won't have a jury.<eos> Sure you will.
He don't care that he caused all this.<eos> I didn't cause anything.<eos> Who said Montany's a cowman's paradise?<eos> Well, it is.<eos> You know the country.<eos> We was counting on you to choose the way.<eos> I ain't decided for sure yet.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> Let us know when you do.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I...<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> I...<eos> Darn, Newt, he acted like you was his kin.<eos> No.<eos> I ain't kin to nobody, Pea.<eos> Lorie.<eos> You're going to go crazy sitting up here every day like this.<eos> How do you know Captain Call's even going to come back this way?<eos> He will.
"Good luck to you and your gals. "<eos> I wonder if you want me to read that letter to you.<eos> No.<eos> No. I'll just keep it.<eos> He put my name on it.<eos> I can read that.<eos> I'll just keep it.<eos> They'll all forget you, Gus.<eos> They got their own doings.<eos> But I won't.
3.600 of them, if need be! But I am getting to the bottom of this matter.<eos> " If Eliza Dunn... " ... will communicate with this address ... " ... she will hear something to her profit ... "<eos> - "Advantage".<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Good.<eos> You have that, miss Lemon?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Poirot.<eos> - Put it in all the newspapers you can think of.<eos> - She won't read "The Times", I shouldn't think.<eos> No, my dear Miss Lemon, perhaps she will not, but perhaps her new employers will.
Hi!<eos> - What happened to Grandpa?<eos> - He threw his back out again.<eos> - How's Granddad's little pumpkin?<eos> - How did you do that?<eos> Out on the golf course.<eos> Are your folks home yet?<eos> I brought pizza!<eos> - Who's going to eat all that?<eos> - I will.
Listen.<eos> L-I don't know.<eos> I don't know, Masha.<eos> This is...<eos> This is not a good time for me.<eos> It's a very bad time.<eos> You did it deliberately.<eos> All year you promised to take me to the country...<eos> - It's still a promise.<eos> I will...
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> How's it going so far?<eos> Good?<eos> I never know retirement mean such hard work.<eos> - You like to see inside shop?<eos> - Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> Partner show you around.<eos> Don't forget lock up.<eos> No, I won't.
Go to sleep.<eos> You stay at home.<eos> I'm going out.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To the Chiefs.<eos> Sleep now.<eos> Dac... is there anything to eat?<eos> Calm down, Lan.<eos> But they didn't enjoy it.<eos> They will.
I couldn't have done nothing, you couldn't have done nothing.<eos> No one could have done nothing.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> I think I'm gonna take a little walk.<eos> You wanna come?<eos> No.<eos> I'll stay here with Kenny.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mom, you think Sharon Kay will come back?<eos> No, baby, she won't
Why?<eos> How can you ask?<eos> I am asking you, sir.<eos> Because of what she had done to us, to our marriage.<eos> Your wife only told you of her decision to leave you... when she joined you down at the excavations after Mrs Boynton was dead.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> I knew anyway.<eos> But it matters a great deal, sir.<eos> Look, I strongly advise you to tell the truth.<eos> By God, I will.
I've got a job.<eos> Go and play somewhere.<eos> -Where?<eos> In the hallway.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> -Here?<eos> No, on the outside.<eos> -All right, but how?<eos> You take care of the paperwork, I'll come when I can.<eos> You won't.
-Janet, I am dropping this case.<eos> Please don't!<eos> I shouldn't have done it, but I felt sorry for him.<eos> You heard the awful story about his girlfriend.<eos> -How did it make you feel?<eos> -It made me physically sick.<eos> Then please help him.<eos> Please, please!<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Your wife's coming back.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> She'll be hours.<eos> It's about what I said to you.<eos> It is all right for us to speak.<eos> It is?<eos> Provided that we don't discuss the case.<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> It's just, if anyone saw us talking...<eos> Oh, but they won't.
To me, you are Nikita.<eos> And I am Konstantin.<eos> You may call me tovarich.<eos> It's our Russian word for "friend."<eos> Do you have another cigarette, Konstantin?<eos> You smoke, Nikita?<eos> What would the Surgeon General say?<eos> Russian cigarettes.<eos> You will acquire the taste, Nikita.<eos> As you will for all things Russian.
ChiIIum's very sick.<eos> We need money for medicine.<eos> Take what you want.<eos> I took 20.<eos> Fine.<eos> ChiIIum said the souls of Bombay's dead children... wander underthe bridge at night.<eos> You believe everything ChiIIum says?<eos> This drug racket isn't my scene.<eos> So don't tell ChiIIum.<eos> I won't.
So it's me who bit him.<eos> That's my work.<eos> That'll mean a beating.<eos> However did you managed to lure such a nervous dog, Philip Philipovich.<eos> By kindness.<eos> The only way to deal with a living being.<eos> Terror will get you nowhere.<eos> That I have maintained, do maintain, and always will maintain.<eos> They believe, terror will help them.<eos> Well, it won't.
This is a disgrace.<eos> If there were a discussion now I would prove to this Pyotr Alexandrovitch...<eos> Pardon me, do you wish to open a discussion right now?<eos> I can understand your irony, Professor.<eos> We will leave now. Still, as chairman of the cultural department of this house I...<eos> - Chairwoman.<eos> - Chairwoman.<eos> ...I suggest that you buy some of these magazines sold for the benefit of the children of Germany.<eos> - Fifty kopecks a copy.<eos> - No. I will not.
- Because he is not a man.<eos> - Is your name Lancelot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Are you a descendant of the famous wandering knight Lancelot?<eos> Yes, he is my distant cousin on my mother's side.<eos> I accept your challenge!<eos> Wandering knights - just like gypsies.<eos> I have to destroy you.<eos> I'm ready to fight you, but I have no weapons. Give me until tomorrow.<eos> - No I won't.
Hello.<eos> -Hello.<eos> My door closed on me and the key's on the inside.<eos> I stepped out to call Boris, because he forgot his briefcase... and the wind made my door slam.<eos> Could I use your phone? I need to call a locksmith.<eos> -No, that's not possible.<eos> Why?<eos> -Listen, I'm expecting someone.<eos> You won't leave me outside like this?<eos> -Yes, I will.
Is that the code for it?<eos> It's possible.<eos> How the hell would you know, lady?<eos> Because I used to date a guy... who worked at the Rand Corporation.<eos> I've just been trying to reach a few of our friends... who could tell me if the unthinkable... was being thought about in D.C.<eos> At this very moment, 4 out of 5 are in transit... to the extreme southern hemisphere.<eos> I find that more than just very curious.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> We have less than forty-six minutes till we know.<eos> And then everyone will.
(SCREAMS)<eos> BRAD: Oh, God.<eos> We're at my parents' party.<eos> Now, kid, stay right where you are.<eos> Don't move.<eos> - My parents.<eos> - What are we going to do?<eos> - I'm going out there to find Sara.<eos> - You can't. They'll see you.<eos> No, they won't.
And now I've met someone with whom the very opposite happened.<eos> Feels good with me?<eos> - It's you and me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I have to go, but I'll be back Monday.<eos> To leave again?<eos> Yes, but with you, if you want.<eos> If you don't change your mind.<eos> I never will again.
Can I go back to Paris with you?<eos> Dad won't know.<eos> Did you have a good lunch?<eos> Your mother's nice.<eos> Boy, can she talk fast.<eos> She's crazy.<eos> You'll see her again soon.<eos> I know how to thread it.<eos> It'll break like last time.<eos> No, it won't.
She's asleep.<eos> - She's asleep.<eos> - Look all the flowers on Foncica.<eos> My brother sent her a blue flower.<eos> I can only see things in my house.<eos> Things in my house are very bad.<eos> I don't know what to advise my son.<eos> I think he should pay for the wedding... but it's important that he don't look ridiculous.<eos> - Why don't you talk to him?<eos> - I will.
Perhaps.<eos> And hunt for ambergris?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Will you... will you brush my hair?<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you do, Libby?<eos> Well, I'll go home to my Anna... and I will ask her to find me a companion.<eos> I'm sure she'll do that for me.<eos> Of course she will.
What do you want?<eos> You frightened the piss out of me.<eos> Move over.<eos> I'm getting in.<eos> Oh, this is ridiculous.<eos> I'll have to sleep in your bed.<eos> - I'll have to come with you.<eos> - Will you get out?<eos> - No.<eos> - All right, then I will.
Have I left it at home?<eos> My God, the milk is boiling over!<eos> Bye, you will be home soon?<eos> You are sulking.<eos> You are far cy from your happy and smiling self.<eos> Shall we go to the cinema?<eos> -No.<eos> Shall we go out for dinner?<eos> Aren't you going to tell me what is the matter with you?<eos> - I will.
- No.<eos> Then you ain't no man yet.<eos> Not even close, are you, Mr. Chicken-Ass?<eos> Come on, Willie.<eos> I'm not chicken.<eos> I'm not crazy either.<eos> You want me to get you to Mississippi on what they pay me here?<eos> I got some money I been saving.<eos> - You're not gonna teach me the song?<eos> - Sure I will.
Do you want anything else?<eos> Aren't you hungry?<eos> - No.<eos> - I am.<eos> Listen to that commotion at Sally's.<eos> - I wonder if they've cut the cake.<eos> - Were you thinking of the cake?<eos> Your cravings again...<eos> - I'll go upstairs to ask.<eos> - No, I will.
There it is.<eos> What's wrong with your wig?<eos> A bad fold maybe?<eos> Why does it get up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Shit!<eos> What do we do?<eos> You're called Jean-Claude!<eos> If they ask questions, I'm screwed.<eos> They won't.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.<eos> I am dead to you, remember, huh?<eos> Chozen, you are your uncle's finest student.<eos> No disgrace him here.<eos> Your student disgrace me.<eos> I have been dishonored all because of him.<eos> For whatever happened, I apologize.<eos> Apology will not give me back my honor!<eos> - Well, neither will this.<eos> - In their eyes it will.
I don't believe that the King wants me to marry Guilford Dudley.<eos> Ellen, please take your mistress to the gallery.<eos> - No! - If you value your position in this house.<eos> - My Lady.<eos> - No! Stop her!<eos> Take her! Take her!<eos> See reason!<eos> - No!<eos> - Take her!<eos> I will not!
- Will it count?<eos> - Everything counts, on TV.<eos> Even the presentation.<eos> I'll have a go, but I've never done it before.<eos> Stop.<eos> Slop!<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I'm out of practice.<eos> You'll see in 2 or 3 months...<eos> I won't.
Where shall we go?<eos> You choose.<eos> Bertha one.<eos> Ivan twenty-seven.<eos> Ivan nineteen.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Yes?<eos> Wait!<eos> I don't think it'll work out.<eos> - What won't?
Let's read the 'Hyber Rock' story again.<eos> Kahya!<eos> Come here.<eos> Yes Agha.<eos> - What is wrong?<eos> - Nothing, but it's a little bit sour.<eos> What is it?<eos> - You'll get upset.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> You will not?
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.<eos> - The future.<eos> - That's where you're going.<eos> - Right.<eos> I've always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years... seeing the progress of mankind.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'll also be able to see who wins the next 25 World Series.<eos> Doc.<eos> Look me up when you get there.<eos> Indeed I will.
You look exquisite today.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Hello, Spiro.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> You remember my son Samuel.<eos> Of course.<eos> We're joining Mrs. Terrain.<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought we'd talk.<eos> We will.
The average age for men in the Bronze Age was 18, in the Roman era, 22.<eos> Heaven must have been beautiful then.<eos> Today it must look dreadful.<eos> When a man reaches 40, he has no chance to die beautifully.<eos> No matter how he tries, he will die of decay.<eos> He must compel himself to live.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Call off your plan.<eos> Someone found out?<eos> No, but they will.
I told you, your uncle can't take care of a dog.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Did you write down ""raincoat"?<eos> - Please, Mom.<eos> Help Mr. Sandberg pack now.<eos> Don't bother your mother.<eos> Raincoat!<eos> - I'm not going to any uncle! - Shut up, for God's sake!<eos> - I won't.<eos> I won't.
Why not?<eos> - Did you write down ""raincoat"?<eos> - Please, Mom.<eos> Help Mr. Sandberg pack now.<eos> Don't bother your mother.<eos> Raincoat!<eos> - I'm not going to any uncle! - Shut up, for God's sake!<eos> - I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
Forget it.<eos> Fatso, can't you find out who plants leaflets with Kraft?<eos> Is it a hunt?<eos> - No.<eos> - So why do you need it?<eos> It's business.<eos> I don't know, but I may ask.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Listen! Maybe you'll have more such spare hard tracks tomorrow?<eos> I will.
You'll go back to prison, and if you raise a hand against some of my kinds again, I will come again and kill you.<eos> What do you want? Money?<eos> Money?<eos> Take dollars, gold dollars, take them.<eos> Sign the checks.<eos> Checks? In blanco?<eos> All of them.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I won't give it.<eos> I won't, I won't, I won't.
The fact is, everyone's working to get that murderer paroled.<eos> Are you too, sir?<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Then understand this... The girl is here of her own free will, like the others.<eos> And I won't hand her over.<eos> You're going against her family.<eos> She's an adult of sound mind.<eos> No one can force her.<eos> The judge will.
When my hands touch your ancient keys,<eos> My old, tired piano shares<eos> - Are you really a jazz band?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't look it. People'II laugh when you start to play. - But why?<eos> - It beats me.<eos> Stepan, Zhora, and that fatso - call that a jazz band?<eos> That fatso is a great saxophone player. A jazz band!<eos> Yep. We'll work out a real jazz program.<eos> Not with them you won't. But why?
Do you want me to beg on the streets?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> - All they want to see is your work.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What's wrong with that?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Just shut up.<eos> One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.<eos> They'll come anyway.<eos> - No, they won't.
Disgusting worm!<eos> Well, it'd be a great help... if you'd leave now... if you'd leave the room...<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Get out!<eos> I won't!<eos> Get out.<eos> Don't send me out.<eos> - Get out...<eos> - I won't...
Get Guarrigue here, fast!<eos> You wanted to see me, President?<eos> I want to settle things.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I want you to call Senanques.<eos> We're out of touch.<eos> Fix up a meeting.<eos> Impossible.<eos> He wouldn't come.<eos> Yes he will.
Remember.<eos> McCoy!<eos> One alive, one not, yet both in pain.<eos> What must I do?<eos> You must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.<eos> Only there can both find peace.<eos> What you ask... is difficult.<eos> You will find a way, Kirk.<eos> If you honor them both, you must.<eos> I will.
They're mine.<eos> Give me.<eos> They're mine.<eos> -What's on?<eos> -Give me my bottles.<eos> I saw them first.<eos> He has taken my bottles.<eos> I saw them earlier.<eos> You just arrived today. You must give him.<eos> -I won't.
But mark my words:<eos> You can have my head, but he who gave the order will soon rot beside me.<eos> He knows that if he kills me, it will be his death as well.<eos> You want to murder me without a trace.<eos> You forbid journalists to take notes.<eos> The clerks sit idly by.<eos> They too have been told to write nothing.<eos> It must all disappear.<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
Well me neither, but you get to dress in white just like a bride.<eos> Well when I grow up I'm never getting married.<eos> And why not?<eos> Because all brides have that stupid look on their faces.<eos> Look at the wedding photos in the stores, you'll see.<eos> Alright, enough chitchat!<eos> Wait, don't turn it off!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Milagros, do you think my dad will come to church tomorrow?<eos> Of course he will
Twerp.<eos> That argument that Daddy and I had... is just a kind of a sign that it's time for me to be going on my own. But you mustn't tell Mom about it, do you hear?<eos> Aren't you going to tell Mom goodbye?<eos> I'll write to her. She'll understand.<eos> Where are you going, Frank?<eos> You know the money I won for boxing.<eos> The man who owns the whole troupe, Jimmy Sharman... he wants me to be one of his regular fighters.<eos> I'll travel around the whole country and see things you've never dreamed of.<eos> I wish you'd take me with you.<eos> Will you, Frank?
Hated me?<eos> - For growing up? - Yes.<eos> When you were a little girl, you were like my own child to me.<eos> You were the rose of my life.<eos> - I could have you then.<eos> - You can have me now.<eos> You can marry me. You love me.<eos> But I love God more.<eos> I do love you, Meggie.<eos> I always will.
Get out now.<eos> Go while you can!<eos> No, darling, no!<eos> I won't!<eos> Kimei.<eos> Listen to me. You've got to go while you still can!<eos> Never! I would rather die!<eos> Kimei, you're talking like a fool.<eos> You've got Gen and the baby to think of now.<eos> No, I won't!
You better get started,<eos> Yeah!<eos> What do you think?<eos> Let's try it.<eos> Christine's gonna come through the door.<eos> You better get in the office and stay out of sight.<eos> Once she gets inside, hit the button and bring the door down.<eos> Then we'Il have her trapped.<eos> What if he doesn't come?<eos> Christine will.
So? They' re over.<eos> That's it?<eos> Alright. I' ll be careful.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> How about you go on the pill?<eos> I' ll need to go to the doctor. I don't want to.<eos> OK, let's just wait a few more days.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I won't!
What are you talking about?<eos> Replace me with whom?<eos> Do you know what he's talking about?<eos> No sir.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You promised to improve our food ration.<eos> You eat the same as we eat.<eos> Give me the names of your experts.<eos> No, Captain Yonoi.<eos> I will not.
I'm sure you've all read chapters six through eight by now so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.<eos> Wanna put your books on the floor, please?<eos> - You didn't tell anyone, did you?<eos> - No.<eos> Glenn knows.<eos> What about Barry?<eos> - He knows too.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just don't tell anyone.<eos> - I won't.

- Partexano!<eos> The net!<eos> - What?<eos> The net, in my cabin!<eos> It never happened! Excuse me!<eos> It was a stupid incident<eos> I'm really...<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - Don't be afraid, they'll catch it<eos> Without a doubt, they will!
-Yes.<eos> -He told us to stay here.<eos> -Well, perhaps he's in trouble.<eos> Oh, he's always in trouble, Tegan.<eos> Haven't you noticed?<eos> It amuses him.<eos> Well, it doesn't amuse me.<eos> He promised to get me back to Heathrow.<eos> He'll lose me my job.<eos> -No, he won't.
Otherwise you soot all my tools... and I was cut soot.<eos> You were such, and I think so, and remained little rascal.<eos> Happy first month! Happy first month, my dear Hoang!<eos> Happy first month!<eos> And now we have to blow out the candles.<eos> Fine.<eos> Almost happened.<eos> I can not.<eos> He is too tight.<eos> I will.
I just want to tell you something.<eos> I think that it's about time to come upstairs.<eos> No, I don't want.<eos> You work if you want, I won't.<eos> You were always saying that you work your ass of. Here is your chance.<eos> Chole!<eos> Chole!<eos> - You are manager, chief.<eos> What's left to others if you don't want?<eos> - No, I won't
Tell me more about this Cutter.<eos> He's....<eos> He's a monster.<eos> He has a camp where he and his followers hold women and children prisoners.<eos> Usually kills the men.<eos> Children too when they get old enough to give him any resistance.<eos> I have a girlfriend and her baby who are still there.<eos> I managed to get away but I gotta keep moving all the time.<eos> If I stay too long in one place, he'll find me.<eos> I now he will.
Yes.<eos> How about some breakfast?<eos> I was just gonna make some.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well?<eos> Leon ... .<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's only two of us now.<eos> Then we're stupid and we'll die.<eos> No, we won't.
Fuck you.<eos> Nicole?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Nielsen.<eos> I don't want to see him;<eos> he'll just mess me up.<eos> Well, it's your decision.<eos> Nicole, you want a beer?<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Maybe I will.
Gilmore's family's appealing the state.<eos> Who are you paying for the rights, Samuels?<eos> Who do you represent, Samuels?<eos> Why was Dennis Boaz fired?<eos> I want to apologize for driving you around in a Rolls Royce.<eos> It's my boss's.<eos> I don't care about the accommodations.<eos> I just want to get to the prison to see my brother.<eos> It's been four years.<eos> Yeah, well, you will.
Could you look for him? Tell him it's Paula.<eos> Liberty time, boys and girls.<eos> Fall out!<eos> Aye, aye, sir!<eos> - Where you going?<eos> Where's my bread?<eos> - Forget that thing.<eos> Come on, Perryman. Come on.<eos> - Seeger, don't forget TJ's.<eos> - I won't.
You'll be ok.<eos> I hope I haven't upset your plans.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> I thought I might have caused an argument.<eos> Oh you mean Jenner.<eos> No problem.<eos> Justin?<eos> I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.<eos> We will.
- I know not, but he risked all for me.<eos> This savior, did he have a gauntlet of steel?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> Do you know him? Aye, all too well. Damn his heart.<eos> He goes out for a joint of beef and ends up rescuing a king's wench. - Now it falls to us to fetch him.<eos> - He's been captured?<eos> The lad will be crucified tonight.<eos> We can't let him die for us.<eos> - We must save him!<eos> - We will.
Oh, it was good.<eos> Look right here.<eos> Oh yes, I see! Mhh.<eos> The bookstore at the corner has a window.<eos> Just your books are in it!<eos> Really?<eos> You should go in.<eos> Carlo would love to say hello!<eos> That sounds very nice.<eos> Maybe I will some day.
Stop right here!<eos> I'll walk, you drive and I'll see you later!<eos> - Ok!<eos> I called you over here coz I didn't want to come to you til we finished doing a complete checkup.<eos> Was it the same killer?<eos> I think so.<eos> Only this time it was done with an axe!<eos> You didn't get the yellow envelope yet?<eos> Oh No!<eos> - You will!
Remove this stain from our faces. Clean our honor.<eos> Farewell sister.<eos> Maybe we won't see each other again.<eos> - You have so much right on me.<eos> - Nobody has.<eos> May God forgive you.<eos> I kept this for bad days.<eos> I don't need this anymore.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - I won't.
I just wanted to see you It's all right, sir he's a friend of mine.<eos> I'll take care of him.<eos> I told you I told you I wanted to see you<eos> Have you been doing that a lot?<eos> Drinking by yourself after I've gone.<eos> About twice.<eos> Well, maybe four times.<eos> It's only when they start bothering me.<eos> I'd be all right if only they'd leave me alone.<eos> They won't now.
I hope so.<eos> Now, get me the photo print record on a scientist named Justin.<eos> A genetic engineer.<eos> Certainly.<eos> I want you to work out a landing plan for this ship on Bucol Two as soon as possible.<eos> Those animals have been out so long.<eos> Won't they die?<eos> They'll come in when they're hungry enough.<eos> All except Og.<eos> - And why won't he?
- Or it might have been heart failure.<eos> Unless you want to perform an autopsy I suggest we move on.<eos> I haven't used old-fashioned percussion bullets in a long time.<eos> At least we know they'll work.<eos> - Well, as long as four of them do.<eos> - Four of them?<eos> That's all the Federation sent, isn't it?<eos> Assuming they got down in one piece.<eos> Afraid it won't work, Investigator?<eos> Afraid it will.
You can trust me or not.<eos> You must know one thing...<eos> The situation's not bad.<eos> Is this place bugged?<eos> Probably.<eos> They're going on the offensive.<eos> Who is?<eos> You have too many friends who believe in tanks.<eos> - They'll never give in.<eos> - Yes they will.

- Two weeks.<eos> - Two weeks?<eos> Bugger it.<eos> Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.<eos> Hey, Arch...<eos> - two weeks, that's not too long.<eos> - No.<eos> - Hey, Arch, hang on, will you?<eos> - Better take this.<eos> Archy, will you...
OK.<eos> Now leave me the car.<eos> Take Margie's keys and go to her place and wait there.<eos> Can you drive a motorbike?<eos> Heinrich taught me.<eos> It's outside.<eos> Now, I'll take care of Bob and everything.<eos> I'll go to the bank on Monday and take the money out.<eos> If Bob wakes up, tell him...<eos> I will.
Well, the previous maneuvers weren't successful. I'm trying something else.<eos> The other tricks didn't work out, so you invent another one, preferably one that's even more deceitful than your last.<eos> No, Alice...<eos> a meeting is not always a trap.<eos> Captain, I think Inspector Rosen might be right.<eos> In any case, if anybody meets with Beaumont, it will have to be you.<eos> All right, I'll try to contact Joss.<eos> But I want you to promise me something.<eos> Give me enough time to convince him, or at least to try.<eos> Of course we will, Edouard!
Kill her if you can, loverboy.<eos> Forgive me, Linda.<eos> Oh, Ash.<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Ash.<eos> Help me, please... Ash.<eos> Oh, Ash.<eos> Please, don't let them take me away again.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No, I won't.
Are you sure he's taking it apart?<eos> Either he takes it apart or it takes him apart.<eos> Captain, how are things progressing?<eos> I have completed dismantling.<eos> I'm glad that's over.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I should never have let him stay.<eos> In a week or two, we'll have forgotten it ever happened.<eos> - Will we?<eos> - Of course we will.
- If you don't like me, I don't want to see you.<eos> Never again will I see you.<eos> I like you, Goya, of course I like you.<eos> I like you as a woman.<eos> I can't stop thinking of you.<eos> That's not normal, Goya.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> You may kiss me.<eos> If they tell you something bad about me, do not believe them.<eos> I won't.
The cave.<eos> Remember your failure at the cave.<eos> But I've learned so much since then.<eos> Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun.<eos> You have my word.<eos> It is you and your abilities the emperor wants.<eos> That is why your friends are made to suffer.<eos> That's why I have to go.<eos> Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader.<eos> You won't.
If you hadn't mated, I wouldn't exist.<eos> Eat, come on.<eos> ~ Mom is a feminist? ~ Right.<eos> Clandestine abortions are performed... by police officers on women!<eos> Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom!<eos> Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom!<eos> Look, Mom.<eos> Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom!<eos> Hey, you promised you wouldn't take me to my grandparents' house anymore.<eos> Yes, to grandmother Anna and grandfather Eugenio's, I won't.

Just so that I wouldn't be scared.<eos> All the way from Columbus to Hawaii.<eos> I don't think I ever thanked him for that.<eos> Something just went out of Dad when he got the word.<eos> Something I don't think will ever come back.<eos> Suddenly he's old.<eos> Come on, Alice.<eos> The admiral will outlive us both.<eos> No.<eos> No, he won't, Tom.
You know, that animal next door... that Pepper or Pippin--<eos> Pippin, Pippin, Pippin.<eos> He's not friendly... whatever Mr. McGreary says.<eos> He wanted the retriever.<eos> Each time that dog comes here, I try to get him out.<eos> Put that on if you're staying out here.<eos> Can I help?<eos> With this?<eos> No.<eos> I will.
Then we have boy, girl, boy girl, governor, girl.<eos> Shut up or I'll tie your tails together!<eos> Come on! Get out of here.<eos> - Hey, Chet.<eos> Mrs. Parks in?<eos> - Yes, with the governor of California.<eos> The gov's here?<eos> Good.<eos> Tell Mrs. P I'm here.<eos> Yeah, I will.
OK, poses.<eos> We should all be in the picture.<eos> All!<eos> Can't this camera take photos by itself?<eos> There, she'll do it.<eos> She should hold it like this and press the button.<eos> Kodak does the rest.<eos> What's up?<eos> - She's afraid it'll steal our souls.<eos> It won't.
God will comfort you in my son's absence, Nubia.<eos> But not in the same way your son does.<eos> The Lord will look after him, precious lady.<eos> And when Eisenhower returns to the fold perhaps he'll be a stronger person, closer to the Holy Spirit instead of just a jive-ass nigger.<eos> It just seems to me that the son of the mayor of one of the most respectable towns in Michigan should at least know the meaning of the word "rubber."<eos> Especially in an election year.<eos> Candy and I love each other, Dad.<eos> We wanna do the right thing.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> You will.

Listen, I'm expecting.<eos> Didn't you know?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Who's the father?<eos> You are.<eos> Because you were my first man.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I'll have it.<eos> I will.
Take a load off your feet, huh?<eos> Hello, Mr. President.<eos> Ah. Hello.<eos> Mr. President I want you to meet my very dear friend Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<eos> On television, Mr. President, you look much smaller.<eos> I must warn you that Chauncey's not a man to bandy words. Heh-heh-heh.<eos> Oh? Really?<eos> Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man who appreciates discussing a frank discussion.<eos> - Would you be seated?<eos> - Yes, I will.
DECEMBER 20<eos> Here you go.<eos> According to investigators, the victim, Kyohei Kawashima, a 68-year-old lawyer, was found dead in his ransacked apartment, and YEN 50,000 has been confirmed missing.<eos> Based on witness accounts, investigators speculate the killer may be lwao Enokizu, already wanted for murder.<eos> Witnesses confirm sightings of Enokizu in the lkebukuro area.<eos> He says he has a fever.<eos> Oh?<eos> When all's said and done, Mr. Ideike just can't live without you.<eos> Men and women get that way when they've been together... - Oh, shut up.<eos> - No, I won't.
Red level<eos> - Your-Your hand-<eos> - Please don't<eos> I haven't had a fire for-<eos> When did you last see Redstone?<eos> Yesterday<eos> If you see him again-<eos> What?<eos> Yesterday<eos> You won't
And what then?<eos> We'll bring the ignorant masses here and begin work.<eos> - Where here?<eos> - What do you mean, where?<eos> We'll go forward, like in the song.<eos> No, I can't lie to them.<eos> I must go there all the way myself.<eos> You go ahead then, only I'm not going.<eos> - Of course you're going.<eos> You will.
I started my own church.<eos> I'm gonna be preaching' it on the streets.<eos> You can't leave me alone, can you, boy?<eos> I didn't ask you to come here, and I ain't asking' you to hang around.<eos> What the hell kind of-of a preacher are you not to see if you can save my soul?<eos> Goddamn Jesus hon.<eos> Well, look what you used to be.<eos> Look what you tried to do.<eos> You got over it.<eos> So will he.
-It'll counterattack.<eos> Unfortunately, it's been programmed that the war is over.<eos> So it can't attack.<eos> It thinks it's won.<eos> That's the trouble with machines.<eos> So, what will happen?<eos> Well, it will self destruct.<eos> I think "obliteration" was the term it used.<eos> -So, if the Marshal attacks...<eos> -Which he will!
You rest, now I'll be back.<eos> Avon. What do you think?<eos> I'm glad to see you haven't been wasting your time on frivolities.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - Just looking.<eos> - If we can't get Blake back.<eos> - Where did you get the clothes?<eos> I found a room full of them down there.<eos> Why don't you go and have a look?<eos> Perhaps I will.
Day calls, night calls.<eos> Six hours sleep in 24 if I'm lucky.<eos> I'm completely worn out.<eos> I need a society for the prevention of cruelty to vets.<eos> I can't pretend I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.<eos> It's the longest month ever.<eos> - And two weeks left.<eos> Don't rub it in.<eos> I shan't last the course.<eos> Yes, you will.

You're questioning my orders?<eos> - About this, yes.<eos> I know that pig's a killer and it's dark.<eos> Do I juggle a torch and a lancet in my hands while it disembowels me?<eos> Charlie Dent'll give you a hand.<eos> He won't.<eos> The family goes to the pictures on Saturday evening.<eos> Then, manage alone.<eos> - I'll come.<eos> No, you won't.
My most grateful thanks to you, Mr Herriot.<eos> Your very good health, Mrs Pumphrey.<eos> - Oh, and to Tricki. -<eos> - Oh, Tricki, yes.<eos> Mrs Pumphrey, what is that man doing?<eos> Oh, dear, now, please forgive me.<eos> It's just Tricki's special welcome home treat.<eos> Take away half the meat and all the cake. Then I'll forgive you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
What did you say, young man?<eos> His portrait.<eos> Common practice among important breeders.<eos> I might know just the chap.<eos> When's your Labrador due to whelp?<eos> - Wendy?<eos> Oh, another three weeks.<eos> Well, don't forget.<eos> Any problems, one of us is always on duty, Mrs Farmer.<eos> Oh, I won't.
- Smells like cow dung.<eos> More like camel, I should think.<eos> Would you mind not doing it, please?<eos> You are in a state, aren't you?<eos> It's your big day as well.<eos> - What?<eos> Cricket match?<eos> Oh, my God, so it is.<eos> I'll never make it.<eos> - Course you will.
- Here there's too much naphtaline!<eos> - Commissar, we're going to attack!<eos> - First I'll take a look at the Baron's.<eos> - You might as well get your funeral organized!<eos> Not necessary.<eos> If he's sure I'm here, he won't be expecting me.<eos> - You're going to split in half?<eos> - Sort of. You'll be the first half.<eos> - I'd rather stay in one piece.<eos> - But you will.
Yeah, and Link.<eos> And the cat!<eos> They're here.<eos> They've come.<eos> Naturally.<eos> You knew they would.<eos> You knew it.<eos> We've won.<eos> Now they will have turn over the cat and we will turn over the girl.<eos> We will?
Thank you, madam.<eos> Bye bye, see you this evening.<eos> You see, I told you you'd be the first to know.<eos> The moment has come.<eos> Come with me and excuse me if I don't tell you anything more.<eos> - Do you trust me?<eos> - Of course I trust you.<eos> Anyway, I find it very mysterious.<eos> I think you're going to ask me to put a veil over my eyes.<eos> No, I won't.
If that's what you really want, tell me And I won't bother you any more<eos> But I want you to know... That I can't forget you<eos> And the more I try You are still here with me<eos> I love you and need you, Manuel<eos> Tell me something, please<eos> I don't want secrets between us, Luis<eos> That the happiness of one person Has to be done with the suffering of another<eos> It's sad<eos> If you had left I would had written a similar letter<eos> But you won't, right?
I'd like to know where the road is going to be built.<eos> At the moment no one knows.<eos> Some know where it won't be built.<eos> - Who d'you mean?<eos> You're late.<eos> - I had to go and see Mother.<eos> I had to go and see Mother.<eos> Ask your connections in Brussels.<eos> - I'm sure you'll tell us.<eos> I certainly will.
I see death standing between us.<eos> You are wrong, witch!<eos> Death is standing right behind you!<eos> I will lead him if that be your wish.<eos> But all but one of us is doomed to die.<eos> Thus has it been written.<eos> Our problem now, my boy, is to find our way back.<eos> If we move from here, Binro will never find us again.<eos> -Do you think he'll come back for you?<eos> -Of course he will!
Well, the princess does not entirely agree with my plan.<eos> -I can't say I'm wildly surprised!<eos> -In fact she quite refuses to cooperate.<eos> Good for her.<eos> But I still don't see what all this has got to do with me.<eos> Don't you, my dear?<eos> I should've thought that was obvious.<eos> If she goes on refusing, I can marry you instead, in front of the great assembly of the nobles of Tara, who won't know the difference!<eos> -What happens if I refuse, too?<eos> -Oh, but you won't.
You'll have to wait.<eos> What 5 dishes?<eos> No ceremonies, please.<eos> I'd gladly have some meatballs.<eos> So you'll serve us meatballs and Whatever else you find appropriate.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This way, please.<eos> I'll tell them to serve lunch.<eos> Please, tell Truffaldino to come and wait on us.<eos> - I will this minute.
What do you want of me?<eos> An answer.<eos> To what question.<eos> Did you know Agnese Bignardi?<eos> Get out.<eos> Leave here at once!<eos> You were lovers, weren't you?<eos> I won't stand for this!<eos> Get out!<eos> - Neither will I.
They are going to turn Francesco loose.<eos> Any minute now.<eos> I'm willing to bathroom.<eos> I thought you were concerned for you husband, Virginia.<eos> If you are, you are still in time to help him.<eos> Come to the address I gave you.<eos> I repeat it:<eos> 6, Via Dell Ombrone.<eos> Virginia, come here.<eos> Will you, dear?
We got married.<eos> Wow!<eos> All right.<eos> But we don't have to look back on the past,<eos> we'll only look to the future.<eos> Thank you, Lazar.<eos> That was very good, wasn't it, students?<eos> Nobody ever helped me, so how could I be a man.<eos> When I go out, if they don't start meddling, I will.<eos> They will.
VARDAN 2: You will have complete control.<eos> -But here in paragraph four...<eos> -VARDAN 2: Lawyer's quibbles, Doctor.<eos> Well, I've heard that before.<eos> Almost got me killed once, but of course you know that.<eos> VARDAN 1: Sign it!<eos> -Complete control.<eos> -VARDAN 1: My word.<eos> Well, I've signed so many things, one more won't make any difference.<eos> VARDAN 1: But it will, Doctor.
I want you to go to Norway.<eos> See Agnes home.<eos> -In the balloon?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> As soon as they can get a westerly wind.<eos> And Jack thinks he can manage a balloon?<eos> Well, he's got Agnes to help him.<eos> If they get blown near any of those communities they spotted, they're gonna land and establish some sort of communication back.<eos> They might never reach the east coast at all if they depend on the wind.<eos> Ah, they will eventually.
It's good news, Sally.<eos> I've been waiting for this for months.<eos> -Can't you see how important it is?<eos> -Can see it's important to me.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> For all of us.<eos> Here we are, we're what, 28 people, scratching out a living on this hillside.<eos> Your baby will give everyone the sense of commitment we seem to lack at the moment.<eos> Not even Pet's conceived yet.<eos> -I'm sure she will soon. -No.
We're beautiful people, aren't we?<eos> There is something wrong, isn't there?<eos> Kathy. ls it so serious?<eos> Robert, I want... I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears.<eos> I have such fears. - What kind of fears? What kind?<eos> - lf l told you, you'd put me away.<eos> Kathy, I love you. I love you.<eos> Then help me.<eos> Find me a doctor.<eos> I will. Of course I will.
Oh, it's so frightening!<eos> We're going to run into something!<eos> - Now on your own.<eos> - No, no, I won't!<eos> Do you want me to say who you are?<eos> Do you?<eos> You're a Bolshevik!<eos> You know what it means?<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - No, I won't.
-Leonardo da Vinci.<eos> Oh, that Leonardo.<eos> No, I didn't get to see him.<eos> -Good thing, too.<eos> -Oh, why?<eos> Well, his submarine design wasn't exactly practical, you know.<eos> Oh, poor Giuliano, he looked so wistful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Will he have any more trouble from Mandragora?<eos> No, he won't, but the Earth will.
General Ravon.<eos> -Nyder.<eos> -I wish to see you.<eos> If you'll wait in my office, Nyder, I'll be a few minutes.<eos> Perhaps you should introduce us, General.<eos> Security Commander Nyder.<eos> You're civilians, I see.<eos> Yes, but we're not staying long.<eos> -Don't let us detain you.<eos> -You won't.
Quite. Talking about, um, - did you manage to...<eos> - Oh yes.<eos> - There you are, your Lordship.<eos> - Oh, Thank you, yes.<eos> Yes, you know, these sorts of things, their value's soared this last couple of years.<eos> Have they really?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You take my advice.<eos> Get them revalued, and insure them for the full amount.<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
- So, you're sure you'll be all right?<eos> - What, Basil?<eos> - You'll be all right?<eos> - Will you get me my bed jacket? Bed jacket.<eos> In the drawer, the blue one, in the drawer!<eos> Now, you won't forget the fire drill tomorrow?<eos> I won't, dear.
They're flowers, and I didn't ask for the one with flowers, did I?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I only picked that one up to annoy you.<eos> What have you got all this stuff for?<eos> - You're only here three days, you gonna play charades every night?<eos> - This one?<eos> - Is it blue?<eos> Bluish, I suppose.<eos> Now you will remember to collect the stuff from Thomas's, won't you?<eos> Yes, I will.
It would have helped if we'd known what had become of you.<eos> Didn't you think of writing to your mother?<eos> Of course.<eos> But the shame I felt of losing her money my father's sword and pistols...<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> She wouldn't care about those things.<eos> You are her only concern.<eos> Tonight you must write her a proper letter.<eos> Tell her that you're safe and well.<eos> I will.
Miranda, I feel perfectly awful.<eos> When are we going home?<eos> Miranda?<eos> Miranda! Miranda!<eos> Miranda, don't go up there!<eos> Come back!<eos> I've gotta go.<eos> That's Mrs Appleyard.<eos> Let someone else go.<eos> They won't.
Here ! I just got here and I have plenty of work !<eos> And here you are, with your stories, guys !<eos> - What guys ? !<eos> - That's enough ! I have no time for that !<eos> I didn't spend 2 days on a boat to hear your circus way of life !<eos> Stop speaking only about yourself ! There are other people around you !<eos> We all know you're tired !<eos> Since I met you, you did nothing else than sleep !<eos> When you wake up, gimme a call ! And then we'll decide !<eos> No we won't !
All norms are our enemies.<eos> Kill her now for what she's done to our kind.<eos> No, why?<eos> Why must we always destroy beauty?<eos> Why kill another creature because it is not in our image?<eos> Kill her!<eos> It is the law.<eos> All norms must die.<eos> They are our enemies.<eos> And if you won't, I will.
The Dalek menace always remains.<eos> If, as you say, they become the supreme creatures of war, how can they lose?<eos> How can they fail?<eos> Misfortune, lack of information, sometimes overwhelming opposition.<eos> Yes, but tell me, how do the Daleks fail?<eos> No, Davros, that is a question that the future must keep secret.<eos> What mistakes do they make?<eos> -You will tell me!<eos> -No. -You will tell me!<eos> -No, I will not!
You know, what you need is a change.<eos> How about a little trip in a Tardis?<eos> I'm just off.<eos> -Wait, you can't just go.<eos> -Why not?<eos> It's a free cosmos.<eos> The Brigadier...<eos> The Brigadier wants me to address the Cabinet, have lunch at Downing Street, dinner at the Palace, and write 1 7 reports in triplicate.<eos> Well, I won't do it.<eos> I won't, I won't, I won't!
She'll be coming just as soon as she can get away.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> You stay right there.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> Who is that man?<eos> Do you know?<eos> That's Mr Wilson, ma'am.<eos> From the garage up by the big sign.<eos> - Pammy, you must wear that dress.<eos> - I won't!
You must be free to do as you like.<eos> With me.<eos> I want to start over - now that I'm a success.<eos> It'll work out beautifully.<eos> We'll sail along.<eos> For five years, I've wanted to fly a plane.<eos> I had no time.<eos> I'll start next summer and take you along.<eos> you're sure this bed won't do?<eos> No, it won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have my worries too.<eos> Of course.<eos> Would you do me a favor?<eos> If I can.<eos> Would you stand in for me tomorrow night? - Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> You'll have to wear my jacket... and just be polite to all the guests.<eos> - Well, will you or won't you?
- No, I don't.<eos> Calm down.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Accident?<eos> You say?<eos> Accident?<eos> Please, help me.<eos> Help me, please.<eos> Help me.<eos> I will, madam.
We beseech you! If you don't help us, we will have to grind the wheat with our bare teeth!<eos> All right, I'll do it.<eos> But only for so long.<eos> I will need money. I'm preparing for the road.<eos> Well, sonny, God bless you!<eos> Haven't I always said that our Strahinja is twice the man we wish to be!<eos> Come on people, in the name of that, let's drink!<eos> Come on Strahinja, drink.<eos> Come on, go in! Come in, you first! - You come.<eos> Ok I will.
Here it is, catch it, catch it!<eos> God damn it, why did you let it go!<eos> We lost the butterfly...<eos> Why don't you get up NOW, hahah!<eos> Welcome, granny.<eos> - God bless you.<eos> Priest, cheers!<eos> It went dry, huh?<eos> Hey, he won't give her up?<eos> He won't.
Yes, professor?<eos> I'll be coming into your department at 11.<eos> I'll want Mrs. Unwin under the pathescope.<eos> We may have to remodel her transplant.<eos> - Certainly, professor.<eos> - How long is it now?<eos> - Three hundred and fifty seven days.<eos> - Frenkel in Boston kept one surviving for 14 months.<eos> I'd like to beat him.<eos> You will, sir.
Goddamn it!<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Come on, one more.<eos> - I'm already so drunk I can't think.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> I want you to put this between your teeth.<eos> It's going to hurt you.<eos> - lf you want to yell, you yell.<eos> - I certainly will.
- Where's the kitchen?<eos> - Here. We eat breakfast at 7 am.<eos> Honey, I had a nightmare. I dreamed I was a maid.<eos> That won't be enough.<eos> Two of them, me and doggy.<eos> Darn it! Too yeasty.<eos> You can let Sonia off the leash.<eos> They like to play together.<eos> - I'm afraid she'll run away.<eos> - She won't.
But work can wait a few more weeks.<eos> Well, you look great.<eos> That's a beautiful suit.<eos> Did you get it in Italy?<eos> No, here in Paris when I got back.<eos> I wanted to look good so you'd forgive me more easily.<eos> My conquests have given me courage.<eos> I've decided to seduce you.<eos> I hope you won't dare resist me.<eos> Oh, but I will.
How about this one?<eos> You can see her face better<eos> It's not Minako<eos> You still doubt me?<eos> Phone the Kinkaen Inn in Onomichi then<eos> What do I ask?<eos> Do I ask if my wife's having an affair?<eos> Don't do this again!<eos> You say that but she won't return!<eos> She will.
- They get you every time.<eos> - She did get me a little, didn't she?<eos> A little?<eos> Mary, you've been running yourself ragged for her, planning her wedding, giving her a shower, buying gifts, just because you shared a bunk 18 years ago.<eos> Then she comes in here and does this?<eos> Ahh. It's ridiculous.<eos> Frankly, it's not my idea of a friendship.<eos> - You're just gonna take it, aren't you?<eos> - Maybe I won't.<eos> Ah, yes, you will.
You better do as I say.<eos> We'll keep these pictures to ourselves, right?<eos> We had fun when we took them, didn't we?<eos> Hi.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Lena.<eos> I don't think you should be here.<eos> Leave now.<eos> Nobody will see you.<eos> Helge will.
It's the most exciting thing in the world, Harold.<eos> To pit... - your own life against another. - Yes!<eos> To kill.<eos> The taste of blood in your mouth.<eos> The moment of truth.<eos> Another man's life in your sights!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Zat!<eos> - Will they really teach me to shoot?<eos> - Sure, they will.
Cut it out!<eos> What's wrong with you anyhow? Shame on you!<eos> You're over 40 years old, half ofyour lives is past now.<eos> What's your past like?<eos> What will be your future?<eos> Muck and ignorance and fear, nothing human.<eos> Snap out of it while the time's still ripe!<eos> Listen, Docent!<eos> We got to get out of here, that doctor will turn us in.<eos> - No, she won't.
Huh? Oh, no. I just thought I'd come in and clean out my desk.<eos> Suddenly I feel lousy.<eos> Well, that's the way it goes sometimes, Hank.<eos> I guess it just proves you shouldn't Get too used to anything.<eos> Maybe I ought to quit, too. Show those old buzzards...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Somebody's got to keep the peace.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> I don't know. I don't know if I can.<eos> Sure you will.
And I know how beautiful it can be... if you look at it realistically.<eos> I mean, realistically.<eos> Face the fact that it means a certain amount of sacrificing, of unselfishness, denying your own ego, sublimating, accommodating, surrendering.<eos> - Phyllis.<eos> - Say it.<eos> You're hurting my hand.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - Try and remember what I told you.<eos> - I will.
Very good, very good.<eos> But I think we should get on with the will.<eos> Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do.<eos> Very well.<eos> Scratch one butler.<eos> You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will, I'm sure he never would have left.<eos> Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back.<eos> And I think this young man is very handsome.<eos> Shall we keep him in the family?<eos> Of course we will.
- Here.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Good trip?<eos> Are you a poor geologist?<eos> And next year, I'll be a poor Parisian teacher.<eos> We're going to Paris? - So I won't board?<eos> - No, you'll go the lycée.<eos> And challenge everything, like the rest.<eos> Mummy, won't we come here anymore?<eos> We will, darling.
That's crap and you're crazy.<eos> you just want to feel me up.<eos> -Why say that?<eos> -No, I said.<eos> In that case but I won't give up.<eos> I won't let you go until you agree.<eos> you'll lock me up here?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The police will find me all the sooner.<eos> No, they won't.
I would have gone to save you, but I can't<eos> I'm not human anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> I ...<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> You ...how dare you?<eos> I'm still alive, but you've died ...<eos> I have no idea about it, this is fate. Please forgive me.<eos> I wanna see you soon.<eos> Yes, you will.
- ¡Manos arriba! - They got 'em up! Skip on down.<eos> - ¡Arriba!<eos> - Skip on down!<eos> - They're against the wall already! Dónde...<eos> Ah, you're so damn smart, you read it!<eos> - Lot of good you did.<eos> - You didn't help.<eos> You ain't any good without a crib sheet.<eos> - For God's sake, don't drop the money!<eos> - I won't!
From now on I am going to start making plans with her.<eos> Tfanisson?<eos> - Yes?<eos> You won't tell anybody, if I tell you something?<eos> Toots said, he's going to stan making plans with Teele.<eos> Toots?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> - But if he's right?<eos> Homfl No he won't.
And take the dog as well.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You see, Lible was sacked.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have to tell the churchwarden.<eos> No.<eos> But it is our fault and now Lible was let go.<eos> I'll be expelled.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> You won't, but I will.
Is lmelik...<eos> - He's not here.<eos> Don't show these exercises to Imelik.<eos> Let him do them by himself.<eos> If you show them to Imelik, I'll hit you.<eos> You won't show, will you?<eos> - I will!<eos> Let go!<eos> - Not until you promise, that you won't show them to lmelik.<eos> You won't, will you?
Harmless-looking thing, isn't it?<eos> Now, you, mr. Tinned Peach.<eos> Thompson.<eos> Mr. Thompson.<eos> Come at me with that raspberry, then.<eos> Come on, be as vicious as you like with it.<eos> No!<eos> Why not?<eos> You'll shoot me.<eos> I won't!
I destroyed it...<eos> - Destroyed it? It was your only hope. - Silence!<eos> The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me.<eos> And it's time I took command of the Enterprise.<eos> You will help me, of course.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - My crew mutinied.<eos> The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that.<eos> The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.<eos> But they won't.
And someone else was there. A soldier.<eos> A man?<eos> Of course, he was a man.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> Yes...<eos> I understand.<eos> What I don't understand is where were you all night.<eos> Now you'll have to get married, and posthaste!<eos> Come hell or high water, I won't get married!<eos> Oh yes, you will!
Once, my mother forced me to lay down.<eos> A priest made a hole in my head... and took out the stone of madness.<eos> Sick, sick, ill...<eos> - To chew, to command.<eos> - To love.<eos> - To masturbate...<eos> - Mama...<eos> You always lie to me.<eos> Are you going to handcuff me now... even though I'm chained to the cart already?<eos> No, I won't.
What to do?<eos> ...<eos> - What did he say to you in confession?<eos> - Maybe he called realties any names?<eos> - Yes, he called.<eos> - God be with you, Longsfild, you know, that we can be for the disclosure of the secrets of the confessional.<eos> - In general, all this is destined to Scripture.<eos> - Will the smoke from the bottomless pit and become black as sackcloth of hair sun.<eos> - And the moon became as blood.<eos> And will the water of wormwood.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<eos> Yond light is not daylight.<eos> I know it, I.<eos> Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.<eos> Let me be taken, let me be put to death.<eos> I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<eos> I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<eos> I have more care to stay, than will to go.<eos> Come, death, and welcome!<eos> Juliet wills it so.
What for?<eos> The nurse didn't take enough, so would you drop by and see her?<eos> But I am pregnant, aren't I?<eos> Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp-- Blood sugar and so forth.<eos> But you're pregnant. Don't worry.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I'll come in on Monday.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't forget the pills.<eos> No, I won't.
- But you'll be much better off, I think.<eos> - We will die. No, you'll live and develop as you should have.<eos> All this shouldn't have been done for you.<eos> Now the women here below and the men here above will control together.<eos> - They will not help us without the pain.<eos> - There are other ways.<eos> You'll discover them.<eos> You must move to the surface, you understand.<eos> - We will die above in the cold.<eos> - No, you won't.
Is that who you're working for?<eos> At first I refused, but then after a while I found that I couldn't help myself.<eos> I met this girl.<eos> She's one of them.<eos> I've never known anyone like her.<eos> She brought me aboard and I showed them the operation of the ship.<eos> Bridge controls, life support.<eos> She explained that they wanted to know.<eos> I didn't understand at first, but I do now.<eos> So will you, sir.
-Do you understand!<eos> -Yes.<eos> I understand.<eos> -I understand.<eos> -Good fellow.<eos> -What was the matter with him?<eos> -Our control over him is weakening.<eos> Well, that could be dangerous.<eos> If he doesn't obey your orders to come over here, he might...<eos> Oh, he will, Packer, he will.
In prison.<eos> He's to be executed. Oh, when we wake up, have him executed too.<eos> And what is he now?<eos> A bridegroom at his wedding.<eos> He is happy!<eos> And we are happy!<eos> Isn't it swell to have a wedding!<eos> When I married your father, it was not in a dream.<eos> - Give the lamp back.<eos> - No, I won't.
Two and a half.<eos> Aladdin, don't spoil the wedding!<eos> Two and a quarter!<eos> All right. I forgive you.<eos> Why does no one glorify us?<eos> Oh incomparable Sultan, whose brightness is eclipsing moon and sun and fiery meteors, and all the world's emperors!<eos> This pleases us.<eos> I shall go milk the goat.<eos> - Give the lamp back.<eos> - No, I will not!
Will you give it back?<eos> I want our wedding to be real and not a dream.<eos> It is real.<eos> If you don't give it, I'm going!<eos> Then you don't love me.<eos> And take your lamp, too!<eos> - We call you.<eos> - l won't come!<eos> - Come out!<eos> - No, I won't!
- And the heat's up all the way?<eos> - You haven't changed either.<eos> Look, that armchair.<eos> It was snowing...<eos> The same special fragrance in the air.<eos> Still jasmine.<eos> I hope you have some time for us.<eos> All my life. I'm a man of leisure.<eos> Now, then... I'd like to be alone with Belle de jour.<eos> No, I won't!
You're gonna be shot like a traitor.<eos> Your schemes are a load of old codswallop.<eos> If you think you're gonna start a revolution, forget it.<eos> Leo's been pocketing the wages of hundreds of agents who never existed.<eos> Liar!<eos> I didn't devote my whole life to this project to have it destroyed now.<eos> The people of Latvia are waiting for me.<eos> I have the organisation, information and money to answer that call.<eos> You're not gonna stop me.<eos> Nobody will.
- Hey, what does he want to see us for?<eos> - A radio.<eos> - A radio? - Hey, look at those pictures.<eos> Maybe the guards are lonesome.<eos> - Horny bunch of mothers. - Wow!<eos> All right, give them a little air, boys.<eos> Move it, Jiminez.<eos> Okay, sarge.<eos> Well, jump school didn't kill you.<eos> Maybe that stuff will.
-Forget it, Julián.<eos> -But Elena...<eos> Can't you leave me alone?<eos> Another weekend would be nice, but you need a date.<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Wait.<eos> Take the nurse.<eos> She's not bad.<eos> All right, I will.
A typical passive indolence of indolent people.<eos> Ah, I can't believe it's all true!<eos> How long can we stand it?<eos> How long, beyond faith and hope, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, beyond patience and love, can we stand it?<eos> Until when, oblivious to fear, beyond childhood and adolescence, can we stand it...<eos> What does your death prove?<eos> The triumph of beauty and justice!<eos> They will learn!<eos> They will!
Mr Pierce said he'll go all the way up to 10,000 dollars.<eos> Hey, Taw, you hear that?<eos> - L heard.<eos> You're worth a lot of money.<eos> Taw, this wasn't our idea at all.<eos> We're just delivering' a message.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's your answer?<eos> Tell him I'll be thinkin' about it.<eos> Yes, sir, we sure will.
Andy´s back and waiting for you.<eos> Now?<eos> Right now.<eos> He´s just passing through.<eos> But we´re so late already, and I must fetch my brother at school.<eos> Maybe he could go.<eos> The school´s right nearby.<eos> - It´d help us out.<eos> - How can you?<eos> Of course I will!

I understand.<eos> Mr. Anan, I presume that you'll have our ship's captain on hand when I beam down.<eos> He will be there, sir.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> I'm sure that, from this day forward, your planet and our Federation will attain the deepest friendship.<eos> I look forward to seeing you.<eos> Diplomacy, gentlemen, should be a job left to diplomats.<eos> You will, of course, immediately resume a peaceful status.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I will not.
Beratis:<eos> Name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet Rigel IV.<eos> Additional data:<eos> Murders on Rigel IV occurred one solar year ago.<eos> You come from Rigel IV.<eos> Well, many people do.<eos> It's not a crime.<eos> No, but what we're investigating is.<eos> Would you mind taking the stand, Mr. Hengist?<eos> - I will not.
Right, captain.<eos> I wonder what happened to her that she should be so terrified of us.<eos> But I remember the things you "grups" did.<eos> Burning and yelling, hurting people.<eos> We didn't do anything like that.<eos> You're not going to hurt?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Grups don't help.<eos> But we will.
I'll just... let's say, torture him.<eos> No need to be so startled.<eos> What I've got in mind is pure asceticism.<eos> To rise above this world, you must kill off everything that enslaves you to it.<eos> Feelings, for example.<eos> When I take Basini to task, I'll surely feel pity.<eos> But that's inappropriate, because Basini doesn't matter.<eos> Somebody who does the things he does isn't worth it.<eos> So pity in this case is a completely senseless emotion.<eos> A waste of life force, if you will.
Leave me alone!<eos> I'm cold and rotten and indifferent!<eos> It's all just lies and imitation, all of it!<eos> Elisabet, what have you got there?<eos> What are you hiding under your hand?<eos> It's the photo of your little boy.<eos> The one you tore up.<eos> We must talk about that.<eos> Tell me about it, Elisabet.<eos> Then I will.
You want to hit him because he doesn't leave you alone.<eos> You think he's disgusting with his thick mouth and ugly body.<eos> His moist and pleading eyes.<eos> He's disgusting and you're scared.<eos> What are you hiding under your hand?<eos> It's the photo of your little boy.<eos> The one you tore up.<eos> We must talk about it.<eos> Tell me about it, Elisabet.<eos> Then I will.
My wife become suspicious that i have a girlfriend on the side.<eos> Good bye<eos> -Ok, I have everything, thank you<eos> Thank you Paul!<eos> -Thank you!<eos> Answer the phone.<eos> Àëëî!<eos> Ýòî òû, ïàïî÷êà?<eos> When will you come home?<eos> - you will not.....
Calm down now.<eos> Would you mind waiting outside?<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - Now, answer every question they put to you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> You've no need.<eos> Don't submit to a med--<eos> That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam.<eos> What if they ask about--<eos> They won't.
Can half a man live?<eos> Take another step, you'll die.<eos> Then we'll both die.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Don't make me.<eos> I don't want to go back.<eos> Please!<eos> I want to live!<eos> You will.
Certainly.<eos> If you wanted me to.<eos> No question about it!<eos> No doubt at all.<eos> Then you may have a slight chance of saving your life.<eos> The Doctor and his friends have in their possession a full emm of Taranium.<eos> A full emm of Taranium.<eos> It belongs to the Daleks.<eos> You will recover this and return it to us within one Earth hour.<eos> Oh I will.
Aye, they'd be few in number, I'd say.<eos> Aye, no guards, no horses.<eos> Pike would be more watchful.<eos> And Blake would be better equipped.<eos> Could it be this pestiferous Doctor?<eos> If it is, then providence is on our side.<eos> Hmm?<eos> For he holds the secret of the treasure, of that I'm sure.<eos> Then let us find him out.<eos> We will.
I saw you on television, at the demonstration.<eos> People must know their heroes.<eos> The time we live in!<eos> Watching demonstrations on TV like soccer.<eos> I guess you drank to that, too?<eos> - We did, but only to our plant. - Exactly.<eos> Valya, don't be angry.<eos> I'm not angry. Why should I be?<eos> Vladimir Vasilyevich, will you have a talk with them today?<eos> - Yes, I will.
Yes?<eos> Is your suitcase very heavy?<eos> No.<eos> Then, I'll put you down at the level crossing.<eos> - You'll have about 50 yards to walk.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Best of luck.<eos> Don't forget to put me in your story.<eos> No, I won't. OK.
- Hath he said anything?<eos> - He hath, my lord. But be you well assured, no more than he'll unswear.<eos> - What hath he said?<eos> - Faith, that he did...<eos> I know not what he did.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Lie...<eos> - With her?<eos> - With her on her what you will.
- Go back!<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Stop!<eos> You'll make things difficult for Mikami.<eos> Do as they say.<eos> If they court-martial him, is it true he'll be shot?<eos> I think so.<eos> Poor man.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They won't.
What do you mean?<eos> They said one touch from a time traveller will wake it up.<eos> Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do.<eos> Touch.<eos> Sealed inside your casing, not feeling anything, ever.<eos> From birth to death, locked inside a cold metal cage, completely alone.<eos> That explains your voice.<eos> No wonder you scream.<eos> The Doctor will open the Ark!<eos> The Doctor will not.
So you've arrived with the great Maximus Pettulion, have you?<eos> The court just cannot wait to hear him play, my dear.<eos> They may have to.<eos> What are you doing now, Locusta?<eos> Preparing a very special poison, my child.<eos> I can guarantee its effect on the victim.<eos> And whose that?<eos> The victim, I mean?<eos> I've no idea, Vicki, nobody's ordered it yet.<eos> But, they will, they will.
I do not understand.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But, despite that, you will obey orders!<eos> It may be that we shall kill neither the Rills nor these Earth creatures.<eos> Not with our own hands, that is.<eos> It may be better for us to escape in the Rills' spaceship and leave them here.<eos> And then... when we are out in space, we can look back.<eos> We will see a vast white, exploding planet... and know that they have died with it!<eos> But we will not see them die.<eos> You will not!
You are surrounded.<eos> You will come with us.<eos> I'm afraid, my friends, the Daleks have won.<eos> You will hand over the Taranium Core.<eos> If I do, what guarantee is there that you won't fire your guns afterwards, mm?<eos> There is no guarantee.<eos> Seismic detector shows that the object he is carrying is the Taranium!<eos> You will surrender it!<eos> He will not!
You'd better not do that.<eos> Now the rest is up to the Trojans.<eos> They see that we have gone.<eos> They see their Great Horse upon the plain which has descended from heaven to drive us away.<eos> Then they drag the horse into the city.<eos> Mmm, are you sure?<eos> Suppose they set fire to it?<eos> Oh, well, that is a calculated risk but somehow I don't believe they'll want to destroy one of their own gods.<eos> Yes, but once they have the horse inside, won't they close the gates?<eos> Of course they will!
Well I don't see how you can be friends with a Greek!<eos> Oh, look, Troilus, when you... come from the future you make friends with a lot of people and he's one of them.<eos> I see.<eos> But he's not in any way special?<eos> No!<eos> Why do you keep on?<eos> Well, because that's what I was...<eos> I mean, that's what the others were worried about.<eos> Oh... er, yes, well, all right, er, you can tell them to... stop worrying... and let us out.<eos> Yes, yes I will.
It will have cleared by now.<eos> The ammonia bomb was only a warning.<eos> Go inside.<eos> Come.<eos> It's still there.<eos> We cannot escape.<eos> Quiet!<eos> But Maaga, we...<eos> We cannot escape yet!<eos> But we will.
Oh, don't worry, dear boy, We'll find a way out.<eos> Stop that or you're dead!<eos> I can't sacrifice everything for the sake of that one girl!<eos> Listen, without us you wouldn't have got off Kembel at all and nothing'd be worth bothering about!<eos> All right, so we all go back together.<eos> But without me, I doubt if you'd have got this far either.<eos> Yes, all right, but I won't let you hurt Katarina.<eos> We'll head back for Kembel.<eos> As the Doctor says, on the way we may find a way to get her out of there.<eos> You won't.
Come on, let's get there before she shows up.<eos> If she sees we don't have keys she won't believe it.<eos> But how will we get in without keys?<eos> Look, i've thought about nothing else but this project for a whole month.<eos> You don't think i'm going to give it all up for a lousy key?<eos> Alright but what if the owner shows up?<eos> What an optimist you are!<eos> The odds are he won't show up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Maybe he won't but...
How long the afternoons are in Parma!<eos> Tonight I go back to Milan.<eos> All I have left now is Cesare.<eos> At least he's here.<eos> I feel like a pigeon in Piazza Grande.<eos> The ones that peck under Garibaldi's statue.<eos> Cesare is my Garibaldi!<eos> Even he has a pedestal.<eos> I'll be all alone if you leave.<eos> But you won't!
Those who do know can't make up their mind.<eos> Quickly, say one or the other. Bishwabandhu or Saroruha?<eos> - Saro what?<eos> - Saroruha, which means lotus.<eos> Say which one. Come on, quick.<eos> Lotus!<eos> Right.<eos> Bishwabandhu won't accept articles from new writers.<eos> Will they accept articles from new writers?<eos> They will.
We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina.<eos> I carried Lampião on my back.<eos> Ezequiel!<eos> Levino!<eos> Antonio!<eos> All your brothers are dead, Lampião.<eos> Of your race, you alone are still alive.<eos> The souls of your friends are wandering alone.<eos> I broke everything and nothing has appeared.<eos> Nor ever will!
Now you're running amok.<eos> You can't go around suspecting everybody.<eos> Sometimes I'm not even so sure about you.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm scared, Barney.<eos> I'll tell you, I'm scared.<eos> I'm married to the prettiest girl in town... and she's gonna leave me one of these days.<eos> I just know it.<eos> - She will?<eos> - Yes, she will.
May we come in?<eos> Of course, Reverend.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Spooner.<eos> Mrs. Mulligan.<eos> - Hi, Zelda.<eos> - Hi, Rosalie.<eos> We hate to intrude on you like this... but we're collecting signatures... for a petition urging the city council... to close down that dreadful place... if the ladies will forgive my language... the Belly Button.<eos> Of course.<eos> We'll be glad to sign, won't we, Orville?<eos> We will?
I was wrong to meddle.<eos> Get it off!<eos> You turned into a demon!<eos> Now stay that way!<eos> Please get it off me!<eos> I'm begging you!<eos> All right, but will you do everything I say?<eos> I will!<eos> Exactly as I say?<eos> Yes, I will!
- Where?<eos> - I want to go to Milan!<eos> My daughter!<eos> I'll be a maid!<eos> - What about the baby?<eos> - Bastard!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Why do you want to send me to jail? Peppino in jail!<eos> Evil demon, I drive you hence by all of nature's elements!<eos> No, I won't!
Oh no. - Yes, you will.<eos> - Absolutely. - No doubt, Miller.<eos> Well, that would be the greatest moment of my life!<eos> - Hey, what's that?<eos> - It's alright. That's not her train.<eos> It's the Diplomat Express. it doesn't stop here anymore.<eos> - Oh yeah, I forgot!<eos> What's happened?<eos> Come on.<eos> We will.
Do you really think you could buy Serge Millers life?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You can buy anything.<eos> - No.<eos> That will never happen.<eos> You wouldn't care to stake your life on that, would you professor?<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> Good evening, Madame.<eos> Will you really do it?<eos> - Yes Anya, I will.
There is an improvement.<eos> Except for one serious case, all Daleks in section 2 have shown signs of recovery.<eos> Then our position is clear.<eos> For us, the drug is a poison.<eos> And radiation is still necessary to us.<eos> Essential.<eos> I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclear materials.<eos> I want an estimate of the amount of waste matter from the nuclear reactors.<eos> -We'll never get through.<eos> -Yes, we will.
I agree, of course.<eos> But the key, the final key. Do you have it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Ian...<eos> -I have it here.<eos> -Throw it down.<eos> Good!<eos> Now bring the old man to me.<eos> Sabetha will be here and we can enjoy our triumph together!<eos> All right, I will.
DOCTOR: Susan!<eos> We've got to go now.<eos> -Goodbye, Sabetha.<eos> -Goodbye, Susan.<eos> -Goodbye, Altos.<eos> -Goodbye, Susan.<eos> What shall I do with this key, the one I didn't give to Yartek?<eos> -Why don't you give it to the Doctor?<eos> -That's a good idea.<eos> All right, I will.
I can't stop you.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> It's live!<eos> Ian!<eos> What on earth do you think you're doing?<eos> Grandfather, let them go now, please.<eos> And by tomorrow we shall be a public spectacle.<eos> A subject for news and idle gossip.<eos> But they won't say anything.<eos> My dear child, of course they will.
There are three men. He's one of them.<eos> They think I have a quarter of a million dollars that belongs to them.<eos> - Go on. - That's all.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They killed Charles to get it, but he must not have had it with him on the train.<eos> - So they think he left it with you. - But he didn't.<eos> I've looked everywhere, and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.<eos> No, they won't.
But... you have all this!<eos> Yes,...<eos> And you I loved...<eos> William, I did it for both of us.<eos> This girl...<eos> -Won't go to the police... she wrote the letters.<eos> And Broomfield...<eos> I'm innocent. No, no, no, I don't have anything to do with it.<eos> The police... I'll go to the police.<eos> No, you won't.
He took his cassock off... it's time to put a stop on it!<eos> ...where's the window?<eos> ! ?<eos> Please calm down, ma'am<eos> Calm down<eos> - Mr Rusconi<eos> - Pleased to meet you<eos> Do you know Umberto studied all the time?<eos> He even read at night. You know he could have become Pope?<eos> He will, he will
Go back.<eos> I'll stay here.<eos> Just go back.<eos> You'll find the food, warm it up...<eos> By noon I'll be home, too.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> Do I have a daughter in law yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But will I ever have one?<eos> - You will.
- Doctor.<eos> Now, you can go...<eos> The children don't resemble me...<eos> They are exactly like their father...<eos> Their character is also like their father's.<eos> How about you?<eos> Is your wife a doctor?<eos> - I don't have a wife yet.<eos> - But you'll have one.<eos> Yes, I will.
How nice...<eos> How nice that we don't understand each other.<eos> I wish Ester was dead.<eos> Ester...<eos> Why are you a translator?<eos> So that you can read books written in a foreign language.<eos> - Do you know this language?<eos> - No, but I've learnt a few words.<eos> Don't forget to write them down for me.<eos> I won't.
- Maybe they're right.<eos> - No, they're wrong.<eos> And I'll show them just how wrong.<eos> We better leave now. He needs rest.<eos> James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow.<eos> Bandages?<eos> Yes. I hardly noticed them.<eos> Hardly noticed them at all.<eos> - You'll get your chance again, James.<eos> - Yes, I will.
We're never going to get out of this awful place.<eos> -Never.<eos> Never.<eos> Never.<eos> -Barbara.<eos> -What do you think it could have been?<eos> -Sheer nonsense, child.<eos> Imagination.<eos> -We'll die in this place!<eos> -Barbara, no we won't.
There really isn't any other love, is there?<eos> Another old friend?<eos> Go to your father, dear.<eos> You leave her alone.<eos> She doesn't want to.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Does he own this place?<eos> Then I won't go.<eos> Oh, yes you will!
- You need help.<eos> - You're imagining things.<eos> - Shut up, Lolita.<eos> Stop that silly talk.<eos> Lolita.<eos> Now, if you swear to me that this isn't true I promise that I will believe you.<eos> I won't swear anything.<eos> You'll never believe me, no matter what.<eos> I will believe you.<eos> No, you won't.
How did you know I was here?<eos> I heard the superintendent's men were here.<eos> I assumed you would be too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I brought you a nice gift.<eos> I was asleep on the second floor of the gate at Komyo Temple...<eos> - What'll we do?<eos> - It's too late.<eos> We didn't catch the mistake right off.<eos> Maybe they won't either.
And he was struck by her name.<eos> He's Yevdokim, and she's Yevdokiya.<eos> It must have been fate.<eos> While he wandered, fought and matured, this white-faced Yevdokiya was growing up for him, like a forest flower under a leaf, without his even knowing it.<eos> So was it she whom he was waiting for?<eos> - Do you play checkers?<eos> - l do.<eos> Why don't you drop by in the evening?<eos> We'll play checkers, listen to the gramophone.<eos> Alright, I will.
I guess, of course, I don't really know anybody but rats.<eos> Except, of course, Fred here.<eos> You do think Fred is nice, don't you , sally?<eos> For you...<eos> I hope he is.<eos> Give me a kiss, goodbye, uncle Sally.<eos> Till next week.<eos> Goodbye, uncle Sally.<eos> Goodbye, and don't forget to send that book.eh?<eos> I won't.
Tell your lord, the Cid, that we seek neither his favor nor his help. Nor can he expect anything from us.<eos> Now go.<eos> Who has done more for you and Spain?<eos> Go!<eos> Look. Now you are also King of Valencia.<eos> I am king of nothing.<eos> No king at all!<eos> - I will make myself a king!<eos> - Alfonso.<eos> - I will!
It's the King!<eos> My lord, the King!<eos> Forgive me, my Cid.<eos> - Forgive me!<eos> - No! My King kneels to no man!<eos> To no man!<eos> It's not easy for a man to conquer himself.<eos> You have done that.<eos> - If only I could live to see Spain at peace.<eos> - You will. You will!
I mean, ever since my uncle wrote, we've all been waiting and waiting for you to come.<eos> Oh, we have been excited.<eos> So have I. I've been very excited indeed.<eos> Not as excited as we have.<eos> And not as excited as Mrs Grose.<eos> She's cleaned and cleaned.<eos> All the windows are washed.<eos> Just imagine - 134 windows.<eos> - Oh, we will have fun together, won't we?<eos> - Yes, we will, dear.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust.<eos> Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming...<eos> How many charter members are there in this little club?<eos> Just those four.<eos> Out of a total of 31,259.<eos> So actually we can be very proud of our personnel... percentagewise.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Four rotten apples in a barrel, however large the barrel...<eos> - Do you realise if this ever leaked out...<eos> - It won't!
I can't tell!<eos> That's like admitting you're one of Concini's spies.<eos> Knight of Capestang came here at my request.<eos> I knew you were Concini's enemy and I've seen how brave you are.<eos> I wanted to ask you to join us.<eos> You may leave. If your decision is already made up, you'll never be one of us.<eos> You have to understand what this means.<eos> I can fight along your side against Concini. But never against the king.<eos> Who'll guarantee us he won't betray us?<eos> I will!
- Take deep breaths!<eos> Big drinker?<eos> Big drinker?<eos> Well, drink!<eos> Now get outta here and take that wagon down to the sluice boxes and unload it,<eos> - like you shoulda done yesterday!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Oh, Clancy.<eos> If only Sam would look at me with your eyes.<eos> But he will.
- Of yours?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'd like to see them.<eos> Oh, I know I'm being rude, but I really would like to see them.<eos> It would be a birthday present from you to me.<eos> - Would it?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - But I'm - I'm sure you're too busy and...<eos> Will you...
Yes. Inexhaustible.<eos> Spartacus, there's going to be a fight to the death.<eos> - To the death?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I heard Marcellus tell one of his guards.<eos> - Who fights?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> To the death.<eos> What if they matched you and me?<eos> They won't.
Come on, fat boy!<eos> Noble Romans... fighting each other like animals!<eos> Your new masters, betting to see who'll die first.<eos> Drop your swords.<eos> I want to see their blood right over here where Draba died!<eos> When I fight matched pairs, they fight to the death.<eos> I made myself a promise, Crixus. I swore that if I ever got out of this place... I'd die before I'd watch two men fight to the death again.<eos> Draba made that promise too.<eos> He kept it.<eos> So will I.
You fool!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> What have I ever done to you?<eos> Don't come near me!<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> - If you come near me, you'll find out.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> Get away from the door.<eos> Get away, I tell you!<eos> - I won't.
- If you come near me, you'll find out.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> Get away from the door.<eos> Get away, I tell you!<eos> - I won't.<eos> What's with you?<eos> - What's with you?<eos> - Why do you keep screaming?<eos> - Don't come near me. - Then get away from the door.<eos> I won't.
Given the opportunity, I'm confident I shall get to the top.<eos> well, I hope you're right.<eos> well, I'II arrange some appointments for you and send you a list of people you can go and see.<eos> - I hope you have some luck.<eos> - Thank you very much, sir.<eos> Windrush!<eos> Don't forget...<eos> intelligence, enthusiasm, and an air of confidence.<eos> Above all, an air of confidence.<eos> I won't, sir.
The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon. Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.<eos> -Where was that?<eos> -Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.<eos> -Will you check in later?<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> Here, Driver. Take this lady back where she belongs.<eos> -Right.<eos> -That ought to cover it.<eos> -Don't forget, call my mother right away.<eos> -I won't.
What was the reason?<eos> - She tried to enter Shukaku.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> I couldn't stand it!<eos> She laughed at your stutter, didn't she?<eos> Tell the truth.<eos> You should've apologized right away.<eos> Want me to?<eos> - I will, myself.
Now I got you, I'm gonna keep you.<eos> You ain't gonna keep me in a barn, though.<eos> Don't I rate better than a hay mow?<eos> Sure do, honey, but...<eos> you liked to have bust me wanting that big yellow diamond.<eos> Couldn't hardly buy the license.<eos> Well, you listen to me, soldier...<eos> Don't get butt-heavy.<eos> You get a promotion.<eos> I sure will, honey.
I know, but that doesn't make it any easier.<eos> I don't know how to govern.<eos> Don't even try to learn how, Franek.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There is so much suffering and injustice, so many tears in this country. Everyone carries his own burden.<eos> Learn to understand.<eos> What's there to understand?<eos> German.<eos> Did you find them?<eos> No, but we will.
No.<eos> A woman will point the way.<eos> - What will she look like?<eos> - You will know her when you see her.<eos> - When will that be?<eos> - Soon enough.<eos> Will she love me or hate me?<eos> Love and hate are horns on the same goat.<eos> What woman would ever look at a slave?<eos> This one will.
Oh dear, oh dear, he made a right fuss.<eos> How old was Carlos?<eos> - 18.<eos> He wasn't even 16.<eos> I thought he was 18. - 16.<eos> Achim just told me.<eos> And the way he told me...<eos> - Now I'm sorry I roughed him up.<eos> So far only Achim knows.<eos> But tomorrow the others will knowtoo.
No gloomy ones, you understand?<eos> Certainly, sir.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Just look at that decor!<eos> Shinagawa's so classy.<eos> And a sea breeze too.<eos> It's blowing a bit too much tonight.<eos> We'll go for quantity and quality when it comes to drinks.<eos> I know I needn't worry, but we don't want to leave with headaches.<eos> You won't, sirs.
To save yourself, you had to give it back to the one who gave it to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I had to.<eos> And the demon took him.<eos> Not me!<eos> Not me!<eos> You're trying to pass it to me again.<eos> But I won't take it.<eos> I won't!
Say, five percent killed by our own barrage.<eos> That's a generous allowance.<eos> Ten percent more in getting through no-man's-land, and 20 percent more getting through the wire.<eos> That leaves 65 percent with the worst part of the job over.<eos> Let's say another 25 percent in actually taking the Ant Hill.<eos> We're still left with a force more than adequate to hold it.<eos> General, you're saying that more than half my men will be killed.<eos> Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel.<eos> - But we will have the Ant Hill.<eos> - But will we, sir?
I never could wear simple things.<eos> I couldn't even buy them.<eos> When I got them home, they didn't look simple.<eos> He was such a lovely, dear little boy.<eos> He used to say I was his sweetheart... and he was gonna marry me when he grew up.<eos> I used to laugh so.<eos> "You'll forget about me long before then.<eos> "You'll find a prettier girl, and you'll marry her."<eos> You know what he said then?<eos> "No, I won't...
- The albums?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Daddy, your albums are here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Thank you, Lou.<eos> - Don't mention it.<eos> - Hello, Lou.<eos> - Can I borrow him for a couple hours?<eos> - If you promise to bring him back.<eos> I will.
The house is falling apart... and there's no money for repairs.<eos> What's wrong with your brother?<eos> Just as we started making some money... he goes and spoils it.<eos> Where will we find another tenant?<eos> He's getting worse every day.<eos> Picking fights with everybody...<eos> Why can't he get a job?<eos> I've been after him to sell that plot of land... to that Athenian who wanted it.<eos> He told Katina yesterday he'll be going to Athens... to close the deal.<eos> But will he?
So if you can have yours, then I'll have mine.<eos> - Lizzie.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Stop crying. - I can't.<eos> - I'm sorry, Lizzie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Let me go.<eos> I hope your dreams come true. I hope they do.<eos> They won't.
- Jimmy, where did you get that stogie?<eos> This ain't no stogie, Pop.<eos> It's a Havana panatela.<eos> - 85 cents.<eos> And it's a present.<eos> - Who the sam hill gave it to you?<eos> I the sam hill gave it to me for being a big boy.<eos> - You didn't say where you've been.<eos> - No, and I don't have to.<eos> But I will.
I was just going for my rifle.<eos> I was scared.<eos> We all were scared.<eos> We better get moving.<eos> That horse isn't going to hold them off long.<eos> - It just don't seem right to me.<eos> - What don't?<eos> Why a full woman like that would settle for half a man.<eos> Why don't you ask her why?<eos> Maybe I will, Clete.

I can't imagine Cliff with a butch. - Thank you.<eos> - I do see a resemblance.<eos> You look like your father when I first knew him.<eos> Really?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> I hope I look as pretty as Mother when I grow up.<eos> Darling, what a lovely compliment coming from my own daughter.<eos> Of course I want to look pretty. Not to attract boys but for the sake of my dancing career.<eos> You may change your mind in a few years.<eos> I never will, Daddy.
Will I be here for long?<eos> You're asking me?<eos> Very long.<eos> Weeks, months, one year, two years...<eos> Locked up?<eos> Or maybe a day or two.<eos> It depends on the favors you do for them.<eos> What favors?<eos> Watch out, Jost. The war will end. They'll lose.<eos> They will not.
Would you care to wait in my office?<eos> - You'll be more comfortable there.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> I'd better take the children home.<eos> I want Daddy to come home with us.<eos> He can't, Ginny.<eos> He's very far away.<eos> Yes, very far.<eos> Will you call me, please, if you hear any news?<eos> Yes, of course I will.
- About as ready as they'll ever be.<eos> Good.<eos> We just had another talk with Deena.<eos> It seems that the mutates' selection of a leader is straight from the Stone Ages.<eos> The brute who kills all his rivals becomes leader.<eos> And he holds the office until someone kills him.<eos> For a long time now, the leader has been a charming fellow called Naga who seems to have all the sweetness and lovability of a mad dog.<eos> If we could get him, it would simplify everything.<eos> Well, maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> Maybe we will.
If we let ourselves be treated like that, it means we're cowards.<eos> - That's for sure.<eos> - What do you want to do?<eos> I don't know... but we can't let it pass.<eos> Being a Maubrun costs money, he says...<eos> So it's gonna cost!<eos> Next time he's on the rampage about something we lay low on purpose for half an hour just to piss him off.<eos> He'll see if we're Maubruns or sissies.<eos> - This'll work, Louis-César!<eos> ... - What will?
Perhaps you'd like to share my lunch with me.<eos> My friend couldn't stay, and I have plenty of food.<eos> I have chicken and salad and some rolls.<eos> - Oh, just a roll and some coffee will do. - All right.<eos> - Won't you sit down? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I was just wondering if there's much to be done.<eos> - Everything looks so wonderful.<eos> - Not much.<eos> Do you think you'll finish today, or will you have to come back?<eos> Hmm, probably will.
All right.<eos> Hello, Hank?<eos> Look, dear, would you come over here right away?<eos> Yes, we need your advice about something.<eos> Yes, it's very important.<eos> "The times beyond are cold and lonely.<eos> "Far away as the stars".<eos> Once, there were two of us.<eos> Billy mustn't grow up to be a rich man's son.<eos> - He won't.
This girl's from Denver.<eos> The Kaufmans have no air conditioning.<eos> Spend a fortune on sculpture.<eos> The drugstore wouldn't take back her fan, she lost the slip.<eos> So I let her sleep in our bed.<eos> I was just wrapping the paddle.<eos> At least have the decency to keep the paddle of a child out of this sordid mess.<eos> You're mad.<eos> You'll never get away with this.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Then she is smiling at us, I said!<eos> Correct!<eos> She's smiling at us!<eos> Do you want to marry me?<eos> - An hour ago you said you wanted to!<eos> - That was then!<eos> You will marry me!<eos> - You're a strong little sugar pie!<eos> - You will marry me!<eos> You will, you will, you will!
Well, maybe it wasn't a plane.<eos> But if another one of those goes over this house, we won't have a glass left to drink out of.<eos> Believe me, Mrs. Kelley, I'll do everything I can to find out what happened.<eos> We'll see you later, Dad.<eos> Wait till I get my hand on that police siren.<eos> Take it easy, now, kids. See you at my office. - Okay.<eos> My aching ears.<eos> Well, we'll be home soon.<eos> Don't forget that package at the emporium, Allan.<eos> I won't, dear.
Take him to your torments!"<eos> With that, methought a legion of foul fiends environed me... and howled in mine ears such hideous cries... that with the very noise I trembling waked... and for a season after... could not believe but that I was in hell... such terrible impression made my dream.<eos> No marvel, my lord, that it affrighted you.<eos> I promise you, I am afraid to hear you tell it.<eos> Oh, Brackenbury, I have done those things... which now bear evidence against my soul... for Edward's sake... and see how he requites me.<eos> Oh, God, if my deep prayers will not appease thee... but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds... yet execute thy wrath on me alone.<eos> Oh, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children.<eos> - I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay with me.<eos> My soul is heavy... and I fain would sleep.<eos> I will, my lord.
Poor Miss Wallace.<eos> This £1 000 where is it?<eos> It's in a small attaché case in a checkroom.<eos> -Where?<eos> -Somewhere in London.<eos> Of course, we don't meet again.<eos> As soon as you've delivered the goods I shall mail you the checkroom ticket and the key to the case.<eos> You take this £1 00 on account.<eos> The police would only have to trace one of these notes back to you to hang us both from the same rope.<eos> They won't.
He ain't all right with me.<eos> Who is?<eos> Take it up with the Kid, I'm still riding behind him.<eos> Doors are made to knock on.<eos> I'm knocking.<eos> So it's the Johnny boy, huh?<eos> What if it is?<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Why don't you tell him?<eos> I will.
I'll be seeing you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Courage!<eos> - Tired, aren't you?<eos> - Yes, a lot.<eos> It amazes me you've withstood this little stroll so well.<eos> Me too!<eos> It's the first time I feel fatigue can be pleasant.<eos> - Now I really believe I'll get well.<eos> - Sure you will!
I don't care about them.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You don't understand about these things!<eos> Felipe!<eos> - Come on, Don Julian. It's your turn.<eos> - Easy, son.<eos> This hand is quite strange.<eos> - Would you bet on these?<eos> - No, I wouldn't, Father.<eos> Well, I will.
What's wasted?<eos> Well, this evening. My performance.<eos> All my preparations.<eos> Oh, Lily, we sent the letter to that agency in Chicago.<eos> That's all we could do.<eos> If your mother doesn't come, don't be too disappointed, will you?<eos> Well, what else could I be?<eos> If she were here tonight, my performance would be like Mr Halley's comet streaking across the autumn sky.<eos> If she wouldn't come back for this, I suppose she'll never come back.<eos> Maybe she will, maybe she won't.
What goes on? I couldn't resist him.<eos> He's the beginning of a collection. There's a whole army that goes with him.<eos> But you haven't heard anything yet.<eos> But we will.<eos> You'll see. Mr. Jordan looks like Santa Claus, Just like a man who gives babies away.<eos> And anyway it's good practice for you being awakened<eos> By mechanical toys, or a teddy bear in the face. Maybe later on a football in the tummy.<eos> You'll learn to love it.<eos> You will love it, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.
Sure.<eos> But Mom's not gonna be late, is she?<eos> No, no, of course not.<eos> But I feel better now knowing that you're gonna be around to take over. Just in case.<eos> - I'll go warm it up.<eos> - Okay, Bobby.<eos> - About the fishing tomorrow, Dad...<eos> - Yeah, let's have a contest.<eos> - Bet I'll catch the biggest.<eos> - Sure you will.
How did you get it, Reynardo?<eos> Well, must I tell?<eos> Reynardo, you promised me you would never steal again.<eos> I didn't steal it.<eos> If you must know, I'm paying for it on the installment plan.<eos> What happens if you don't keep up with the payments?<eos> I know him.<eos> He'll never keep up.<eos> They'll come and take it away from you.<eos> No, they won't.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?<eos> Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.<eos> Take that!<eos> Insolent boy!<eos> I'll slash you to ribbons!<eos> And I'll cut you to pieces.<eos> - Ouch!<eos> - Careful, Michael, my glasses.<eos> - I'm sorry, John. You'll never leave this ship alive!<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
– Take any other.<eos> – No other.<eos> How dare you speak to me like that!<eos> I'll only give a wink to my vassals and they'll tear you to pieces.<eos> Ask mother!<eos> The King has refused.<eos> What do you say, noble Queen?<eos> Let him marry her!<eos> And I said he won't marry her!<eos> – He will!

I'm not that young anymore.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I feel we're doing wrong.<eos> I've often talked to Father about this.<eos> Should you have the chance, please get married, anytime you want.<eos> I mean it.<eos> It pains us that you won't remary.<eos> All right.<eos> If I have the chance -<eos> You certainly will.
Well, just remember, it can happen to you, too, if you're covering up for this guy, so don't try to walk out on us.<eos> - You're a material witness.<eos> She has a job.<eos> - So what?<eos> - Are you taking that away from her?<eos> You can keep your job.<eos> But when your day's work is finished, I want you right here where I can find you.<eos> He means he'll use this place as a trap with you for the bait.<eos> Morgan found us here.<eos> Maybe the others will, too.
Then I'll let you know what he has to say later.<eos> Well, that'll be fine.<eos> But, uh... how will you get in touch with me?<eos> Well...<eos> you'll call me.<eos> I'll give you my phone number.<eos> Just a minute, I'll get a pencil and write it down.<eos> But, I might forget to call you.<eos> You know how it is with me.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
You can ride on the boat with me. Go, Taro.<eos> I don't want to go without Grandad.<eos> I'll come soon after.<eos> I won't go unless Grandad comes too.<eos> Taro!<eos> Taro, you go first and Grandad will follow.<eos> It's a lie!<eos> Good boys do as they're told.<eos> Go with her.<eos> No, I won't.
Consumer Price Survey.<eos> Right?<eos> You know well.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> Will you pass?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Let's drink to it.<eos> Will I pass?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> I will, huh?
Measures have already been taken.<eos> I must interrogate her.<eos> Give her a tonic, so she may talk.<eos> You must patience.<eos> If the heart holds on, she might have an instant of lucidity.<eos> It seems she wants to talk.<eos> Carlo... .. is in prison...<eos> Where's my baby?<eos> Tell him!<eos> We will.
Your coat's a better fit than mine, and your boots are perfection, sir.<eos> Perfection.<eos> Yes.<eos> I must show you to the prince, begad.<eos> We must fetch your boxes at once.<eos> - If you will have me, milady.<eos> Oh, but I insist that you remain with us, dear, dear Cousin.<eos> Perhaps you'd care to count my teeth, Cousin.<eos> You'll do.<eos> Indeed you will.
He'd been away for two days.<eos> Never stayed away that long.<eos> I was scared.<eos> But I knew something terrible had happened.<eos> I want to do what's best for him.<eos> Anything I can to help him.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> But I don't want Brent and the others hunting him down like some animal.<eos> You'll see that they take care of him, won't you? .<eos> You will, won't you? .
He's my brother.<eos> But I don't want Brent and the others hunting him down like some animal.<eos> You'll see that they take care of him, won't you? .<eos> You will, won't you? .<eos> Please promise me.<eos> Well, why don't you promise? .<eos> What are you waiting for? .<eos> As long as he's with me, nobody will hurt him. That's all I can promise.<eos> If it's like you say, they'll send him to an institution.<eos> Oh, yes. They will now.
As long as he's with me, nobody will hurt him. That's all I can promise.<eos> If it's like you say, they'll send him to an institution.<eos> Oh, yes. They will now.<eos> When it's too late.<eos> That light you saw it came from this house when my brother was here.<eos> Where is he now? .<eos> He's outside.<eos> Where are you going? .<eos> -lf Brent finds Danny--<eos> -He won't.
Where is he now? .<eos> He's outside.<eos> Where are you going? .<eos> -lf Brent finds Danny--<eos> -He won't.<eos> Tell me where he is.<eos> We can't help him if you don't tell me.<eos> I can't promise things that aren't in my power, but I won't let him be hurt.<eos> -Please tell me.<eos> -I will.
What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort of... prim and proper, you know.<eos> I want to deceive him... just enough to make him want me.<eos> Darling... do you want him?<eos> I want to rest. I want to breathe quietly again.<eos> Yes, I want Mitch. Very badly.<eos> Just think, if it happens...<eos> I can go away from here and not be anyone's problem.<eos> Blanche, it will happen.<eos> It will?<eos> It will, honey, it will.
AND HE'S VERY EASY GOING,...<eos> YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE'S BACK?<eos> WHO?<eos> WELL, HOW STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS.<eos> AS YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. I THINK I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE HIM, OFFICIALLY.<eos> RECEIVE WHOM?<eos> WELL, YOUR HUSBAND.<eos> OH, COME NOW.<eos> WON'T YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE ME?<eos> YES. OF COURSE SHE WILL.
Ricky hates nightclubs.<eos> But he works in one.<eos> Your life should be just one gay round of nightclubs.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought when I married a bandleader, but ever since we said "I do", there are so many things we don't.<eos> Well, it was a good idea while it lasted.<eos> Gee, it was going to be the Copacabana.<eos> The Copacabana.<eos> Gee!<eos> Well, don't you worry, we'll go!<eos> We will?
I told him that he had until Monday, not one day longer... and then I was writing my daughter's guardian the full story.<eos> And...<eos> And going to my lawyer on Monday.<eos> And that I wasn't afraid to face what I'd done.<eos> Wouldn't you be more comfortable if you removed your hat, Mrs. Randolph?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I'm so ashamed.<eos> I hoped I wouldn't have to tell you.<eos> But I will.
- Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince.<eos> I'd be honoured, Your Highness.<eos> Would you mind holding my broom?<eos> Well, why not?<eos> After all, I'm still a member of the family.<eos> And it says, "By royal command,<eos> "every eligible maiden is to attend."<eos> Yes, so it does.<eos> Well, I see no reason why you can't go. If you get all your work done.<eos> Oh, I will.
How about going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark?<eos> I'm not enquiring where Mr Gillis goes every night.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> I'm writing a script and I'm going to finish it!<eos> It's just that I am greatly worried about Madame.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> And we're not helping her any.<eos> Feeding her lies and more lies, getting herself ready for a picture.<eos> - What happens when she finds out?<eos> - She never will.
No, no, you didn't.<eos> No, you didn't. I've always known it.<eos> Before I could even talk, I remember hearing them say it.<eos> Everything I ever touched, I destroyed.<eos> Everyone.<eos> My mother, Ruth, David.<eos> Here, drink this.<eos> But no more.<eos> I won't destroy anymore.<eos> Of course you won't.
- Morning, sir.<eos> Morning, Mr. Rice, sir.<eos> Mr. Waring's been agitating for you, sir.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant Major.<eos> Hello, Madeleine?<eos> Hello, darling.<eos> Sammy's just got in.<eos> No. No, it's hardly out of my way at all.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Yes, of course I will.
What's doing at your end?<eos> Doin' fine here. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm talking to that clean-cut, young American beauty again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he's going to tell us something this morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Report in.<eos> I've told you everything I know.<eos> Oh, no, you haven't, sonny.<eos> But you will.
I just wanted to make a report.<eos> I didn't get very far on the Hall call case today. I was tailing someone else... you.<eos> Stay out of my business, Mac.<eos> I will as long as it doesn't interfere with mine.<eos> I told you I like that girl.<eos> Johnny, I like that girl.<eos> I don't care what you like or what you don't like.<eos> Quit meddling in my life, Mac.<eos> All right, Johnny. And don't ever let me catch you prowling around my home again.<eos> You won't.
You were right, Phillip.<eos> Those books were tied clumsily.<eos> - He's got it.<eos> He's got it!<eos> - Phillip.<eos> He knows. He knows.<eos> He knows.<eos> - Alright, easy.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> - No, you won't.
Give me a hand with these.<eos> - Tom, we only have four dollars.<eos> Never mind about the money.<eos> I'm married to a rich woman.<eos> Bring your basket along here.<eos> Wait.<eos> We'll get another one.<eos> - Tom, you'll never get away with this.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Sure I will.
Come back to London with me.<eos> What now?<eos> Are you sick or something?<eos> Yes, I'm sick.<eos> Oh, go on.<eos> You're kidding, aren't you, Fred?<eos> Men are funny with me that way.<eos> Think I'll mother them, I suppose.<eos> But you'll stay with me, even if I'm not sick?<eos> Yes, of course I will.
- All?<eos> You've only got one life.<eos> He's a murderer, your Pinkie, twice over.<eos> First Hale, then Spicer, the man that left the card.<eos> - Did you marry him knowing that?<eos> - Why don't you go to the police, eh?<eos> Don't you see? You're an accomplice after the fact?<eos> You know Kolley Kibber never left those cards.<eos> You've got to tell the police everything.<eos> I never will.
Do you think the atmosphere here is conducive to being straightforward?<eos> Please accept my handling of Julie.<eos> I've asked you once, now I'm asking you again.<eos> Sandra!<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> I wish you hadn't done this, especially after promising me.<eos> I'm afraid Mr. Manning won't like what I have to tell him either.<eos> How dare you spy on me!<eos> I won't stand it.<eos> I won't!
Left Venice, you mean?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did she go?<eos> To the Dolomites<eos> What will you do?<eos> I'm going to find her and tell her about you and Sebastian.<eos> Bravo.<eos> That's the stuff.<eos> And I'll go with you.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
That's the one.<eos> That's the one, I tell you.<eos> - I gotta find her.<eos> - How?<eos> Well, if she's a Brooklyn nurse she's gotta be in Brooklyn.<eos> - But maybe she ain't here.<eos> - She's gotta be here.<eos> And believe me, I'll find her.<eos> I'll bet you the Brooklyn Bridge I find her.<eos> Sure you will, Danny.
Never took the captaincy exams?<eos> Twice.<eos> I flunked because of my appearance.<eos> I told 'em to go to hell.<eos> Who's this Brignon?<eos> A rich ol' geezer with pull.<eos> We gotta use kid gloves.<eos> I can't afford them.<eos> Don't forget your overcoat.<eos> I won't.
I want to find out what Eddie has on you.<eos> - Say that again...<eos> - I'll say it till I find out.<eos> I told Eddie Mars I was coming up to see him.<eos> When I arrived, you were there.<eos> You two staged an act.<eos> He let you win a lot of money and then sent a man to take it away from you to prove there was nothing between you.<eos> You're shaking again.<eos> Take me home.<eos> Sure I will.
What have you done?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Just wanted to talk.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> There's a shyster lawyer in this town with a swank office, a secretary and no law practice.<eos> This shyster's name is Jardine.<eos> He's put a tail on me.<eos> I think he wants to finish where he left off.<eos> You'd think after San Francisco he'd leave you alone.<eos> He will.
A shady place over by Hidden Canyon.<eos> The water's good and deep now, almost over your head.<eos> You mean go swimming... together?<eos> I'll bring along my guitar, play us some music.<eos> You got a nerve.<eos> The moon will be pretty near full.<eos> You didn't buy me, just giving me a horse.<eos> I'll be waiting for you after supper out by the bell.<eos> I won't go.<eos> I won't!
It would be like heaven, being in Mexico together.<eos> I'll show these heel-squatters around here... a thing or two about ranching.<eos> You can do it, too.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Go saddle my pinto.<eos> - What for?<eos> - While I get ready.<eos> - Ready for what? I'm going with you, of course.<eos> You wouldn't like it down there, honey.<eos> Sure, I will.
Thank you, sir.<eos> The light switch is right here somewhere if my memory doesn't fail me.<eos> Okay, Langford.<eos> I'll do it anyway. I'll get an annulment.<eos> I don't need anybody to...<eos> Didn't Langford tell you?<eos> There's no annulment in Argentina.<eos> I'll get it anyway! I will!<eos> I'll get an annulment!<eos> I will, I will, I will!
You think I'd bring him down to that dump if I were on my own?<eos> - You think I'd send him to you?<eos> - Sit down and listen.<eos> I was about to give Mr. Taylor a message for Larry Cravat.<eos> - Then you do know-<eos> - I said listen!<eos> This is what I want you to tell him.<eos> That even two million dollars is of no use to a man in the electric chair.<eos> Suppose he doesn't understand the message.<eos> - He will.
You mess up my life, And you say you're sorry.<eos> I happen to have arranged to divorce my wife for your sake.<eos> I suppose it never occurred to you that someone could say a thing and mean it.<eos> Well, how do you think i feel not seeing you for days?<eos> There's something behind all this.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> You must believe that.<eos> I love bill.<eos> I always will.
Take it easy, boys.<eos> Mr. Jones is just out of hospital.<eos> Go into the kitchen, Jones.<eos> Felix has some coffee for you.<eos> Boys, you realize Mrs. Sloan has had a very trying time.<eos> I will let you know of any further developments.<eos> We'll take care of everything.<eos> We'll have an extra on the street in an hour.<eos> - The second you hear news, let me know.<eos> - I will.
For cat's sake, what's so funny?<eos> You are, Smarty-Pants.<eos> You're the Mr. Fix-It who was gonna make a monkey out of poor dopey little Kitty...<eos> So you gave away two pictures for a couple of dimes...<eos> - ...and now you can't collect the dimes.<eos> - Jeepers.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - What am I gonna tell Chris?<eos> - He won't find out.<eos> The heck he won't.
Why do you always treat me as though I were a child?<eos> Because you are!<eos> I'm not!<eos> I'm a grown up, I'm a woman. I have a right to live my own life.<eos> I know what I want.<eos> You're just trying to take it away from me!<eos> The only thing I've really cared for!<eos> How old are you?<eos> I won't go, I won't!<eos> I won't!
They're to put dead people in.<eos> I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way.<eos> Dead, I mean.<eos> And how it would be if she were dead.<eos> I saw Lola three or four times that week.<eos> One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.<eos> I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that... I could relax and let go a little.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Not gonna tell me, huh?<eos> Of course I will, Walter.
- I'm ready!<eos> What's your name?<eos> Sanshiro Sugata.<eos> I'm sure we'll meet again.<eos> We can meet tomorrow if Mr. Yano allows it.<eos> Don't rush it.<eos> Someday jujitsu will fight judo.<eos> What are we waiting for?<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
Really, Françoise, now it's over.<eos> Over?<eos> It's not possible, Robert.<eos> We'll wait... we'll postpone...<eos> No, no, Françoise, you mustn't be sad and you mustn't be angry.<eos> You know as well as I do that our journey is ready, it's been announced.<eos> Right now, the conditions are optimal.<eos> In eight days, it would be too late.<eos> No, this journey must happen.<eos> And it will.
In that case, what could you tell me about...<eos> Some stuck-up girl, a pretentious person who says she wanted to kill herself...<eos> She's just trying to show off.<eos> No talent, by the way.<eos> - Is she an actress?<eos> - No, but she doesn't have any talent all the same.<eos> - This is amusing.<eos> - Will you allow me?<eos> So you're not feeling any better?<eos> You will eventually.
Where are my flowers?<eos> What? No more flowers?<eos> All right!<eos> You're going to see how we used to go out in the days of flowers...<eos> - You didn't change, you know.<eos> - You changed even less.<eos> What about down here?<eos> Did it change much?<eos> - A little. You'll see.<eos> - Oh, no, no, I certainly won't.
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.<eos> You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.<eos> If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.<eos> Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.<eos> But what about us?<eos> We'll always have Paris.<eos> We didn't have- - We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.<eos> We got it back last night.<eos> - When I said I would never leave you.<eos> - And you never will.
Give her a convertible or a handful of diamonds.<eos> Well, maybe you know more about it than I do, I guess.<eos> Think he'll play ball after election?<eos> I know he will.<eos> Why, he's practically given me the key to his house.<eos> - Yeah, a glass key.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Be careful it doesn't break off in your hand.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> It won't.
For several weeks, Parris.<eos> - Cancer?<eos> - Yes, Parris.<eos> Why wasn't I told?<eos> Why have I been kept out of this like a child?<eos> Madam wished it.<eos> She wanted you to finish your studies without worrying.<eos> She made me promise.<eos> She thought she would live through September.<eos> And she won't?
She must have dressed up like this for my sake...<eos> - I don't think so...<eos> - No?<eos> I'll tell you all about it...<eos> - Have you seen Mistou?<eos> - No!<eos> - His Highness is late...<eos> - Yes.<eos> Maybe His Highness won't come...<eos> He will!
- They've got upwards of a 50 cannons.<eos> - I know.<eos> And we've got 8.<eos> It'll be hard for us, Hetman.<eos> 50 cannons, that's the force!<eos> Someone goes to the polack settlement, as if to accidentally get captured, ...and there under torture show that all our cavalry and Tatars are not in this forest, but there.<eos> That's when the polacks are going to face most of the cannons towards that forest, we strike in the back and cut off the cannons.<eos> Polacks won't do this, polacks won't put cannons that way!<eos> They will.<eos> Honest to god, they will!
- She poured poison into the cup!<eos> - You lie!<eos> Matka Boska, Bogdan, they all hate me!<eos> They want to kill me!<eos> I poured the poison?<eos> Give me your cup, Bogdan, I'll drink up and go away.<eos> Ah!<eos> Viper!<eos> Gavrila, go away!<eos> I won't!
- You know better than I do what I mean.<eos> Do you think I'm afraid to have you at my wedding?<eos> - I don't care to elaborate.<eos> - Of all the conceited, insufferable...<eos> Me afraid?<eos> Why, I'll be married anywhere, anytime, anyplace, with 50 of you around.<eos> - Me afraid!<eos> - I'm sorry that's your attitude...<eos> - Then you will get married here?<eos> - Certainly, I will, and right now.
- There's one thing you can do for me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars. - Be glad to.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> One is enough.<eos> When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty. Well, it was no truer then than it is today.<eos> - I'll take your arm.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You won't forget about those cigars?<eos> - I won't.
You'll want to fix up. You'll want to dress for dinner,<eos> There's a pal of mine up there that makes the most...<eos> - terrific... - But this isn't part of our bargain.<eos> That bargain was all over the minute I paid you back.<eos> I'm making a new one.<eos> I told you the terms.<eos> Now come on, get packed.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> All right, I'll do it for you.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
Nice of you to say that.<eos> As busy as we are, I'll make the best of it. Button your coat. Straighten your tie.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Be neat.<eos> Pull down your vest.<eos> I want no trouble.<eos> You won't have any.<eos> One mistake and I'll throw you out.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Yes, I will!
I remember one or two occasions when she was given orders to change her course.<eos> - You know your scriptures, boy.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Then you know that what's been done before can be done again, for you.<eos> Do you believe me, Huw?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> You will see the first daffodil, out on the mountain.<eos> - Will you?<eos> - Indeed I will, sir.
- You know your scriptures, boy.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Then you know that what's been done before can be done again, for you.<eos> Do you believe me, Huw?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> You will see the first daffodil, out on the mountain.<eos> - Will you?<eos> - Indeed I will, sir.<eos> Then you will.
Angharad is down to the market.<eos> Angharad?<eos> I've come for Huw.<eos> For Huw?<eos> - The daffodils are out, Momma.<eos> - Where are your clothes?<eos> Under my pillow.<eos> For these months, ready for today.<eos> Come you, then, and you shall bring back a posy fit for a queen for your brave mother.<eos> Indeed I will, sir.
How, sir?<eos> By prayer, Huw.<eos> And by prayer I don't mean shouting and mumbling, and wallowing like a hog in religious sentiment.<eos> Prayer is only another name for good, clean, direct thinking.<eos> When you pray, think.<eos> Think well what you're saying.<eos> Make your thoughts into things that are solid, and in that way your prayer will have strength.<eos> And that strength will become a part of you, body, mind and spirit.<eos> And the first duty of these new legs is to get you to chapel on Sunday.<eos> - Indeed they will, sir.
I don't know how, but he's certainly in it.<eos> - Casiano, te felicito. Casiano, te felicito.<eos> - Sí, sí.<eos> Sí, my horse, my horse.<eos> Muy buen caballo. Vamos a tomar algo.<eos> - Ysuerte.<eos> - Gracias, señor.<eos> Gracias. Gracias.<eos> Maybe some time you get a horse with four legs, then we have another race.<eos> - No, you won't.
- The Crawfords had nothing to do with this.<eos> - They might have.<eos> I'm tired of this.<eos> For years you've told how my father cheated you.<eos> Well, I've found out what really happened.<eos> - Here is a letter from my father.<eos> - Why should we go into all that now?<eos> I am a broadminded man.<eos> We will let bygones be bygones.<eos> No, we won't.
- How are you, dear?<eos> Much better now that you're here.<eos> - I guess this must be love.<eos> - Your guess is correct.<eos> I'm just his faithful old dog, Tray.<eos> - Give me your paw.<eos> - You've got it.<eos> How sweet.<eos> - Say, I'd like to see one of those.<eos> - You will.
I tell that to all the tenants.<eos> Anyway, you better get her out of here.<eos> Yes, this is a respectable house I want you to know.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Both of you before I throw you out.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> Please, Michael. Don't argue with them.<eos> Don't worry. I'll go at once.<eos> Oh, no you won't.
I know it will.<eos> And it's what Ed would have wanted.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Well here's to our partnership. May it be a long and happy one.<eos> It could work out pretty good.<eos> I'll tell you what we'll do.<eos> We'll figure out new lines, buy new trucks.<eos> We'll get business we never even thought about.<eos> We'll go a long way.<eos> Yes, we will.
Come on, Frenchy!<eos> Ride 'em, cowboy!<eos> Come on, Frenchy!<eos> Frenchy!<eos> Frenchy!<eos> Come on, Frenchy!<eos> Scratch him! Scratch him!<eos> That thing will go off!<eos> - Go, Frenchy! - Wait.<eos> Will ya just...
But I did mean it.<eos> I was crazy with jealousy.<eos> She's never cared for me.<eos> I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.<eos> You're so wrong.<eos> Scarlett loves you a great deal.<eos> Much more than she knows.<eos> If that were true, I'd wait forever.<eos> If she'd only forgive me.<eos> She will.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<eos> I know you'll get well.<eos> Promise me... college.<eos> Yes, and Europe, and a pony.<eos> Whatever he wants, but... oh, Melly, do try.<eos> Ashley...<eos> Ashley and you...<eos> What about Ashley, Melly?<eos> Look after him for me... just as you looked after me... for him.<eos> I will, Melly.
As the poet says, "Come fill the cup... for the bird's on the wing."<eos> That's good.<eos> I'm just beginning to realize what a swell old world this is... now that I've only got thirty days.<eos> Twenty-nine now, sir.<eos> Jeepers, I've got to do something about my money.<eos> If I leave it to Mrs. Marko, she'll use it to start a war.<eos> [Man] I'm tellin'you, you'll do like I say!<eos> You'll marry Smirnov if I have to hogtie you!<eos> [Woman] No!<eos> I won't!
She encouraged me.<eos> So when she didn't show up...<eos> She's a society woman, and society has strict rules.<eos> I don't need lectures.<eos> I need Christine.<eos> I love her, you know.<eos> If I don't see her again, I'll die.<eos> You'll see her again.<eos> - Think so?<eos> - Sure you will.
Baby, don't!<eos> Why did you have to do that?<eos> You frightened him away.<eos> - Quiet, it's all right.<eos> - It's not all right.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - I have to worry.<eos> I've lost my leopard.<eos> - Please help me find him.<eos> - I will.
Cut it off and give it to me?<eos> That's an idea.<eos> Hurt?<eos> A little.<eos> Tannic.<eos> There you are.<eos> You'd better drop back tomorrow and let me dress this.<eos> I will, if I live.<eos> Well, try to live, on account of it'll hurt my reputation.<eos> Then I'll...
I used to know all of Rhoda's men friends and what was going on, but now...<eos> I know.<eos> Rhoda used to have the house full of her friends.<eos> She's got to have them again, George.<eos> She's got to.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> What happened today is just a sample.<eos> She'll be leaving us next.<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> - Oh, yes, she will.
Right here.<eos> Well, I... I guess this is it.<eos> - It looks like a very nice train. - Uh-huh.<eos> I hear they serve very good food on trains.<eos> Well, give Addie my love, and tell her to take good care of you.<eos> Well, you'll very likely see her soon yourself.<eos> I'll get a job out there, and I'll send for you right away.<eos> I don't doubt that, Bark.<eos> You'll get a job.<eos> Of course you will.
Here, what was all that about?<eos> Never you mind.<eos> You send those pigs back to Murphy's farm.<eos> If you see a stork, throw something at it.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Oh, the express.<eos> - A train?<eos> ! When?<eos> - 10 minutes but it won't stop.<eos> - It will!
- He wouldn't have what?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> You tell him I didn't.<eos> - Tell him I didn't do it.<eos> - Darling, couldn't you telephone?<eos> No.<eos> Someone might be listening.<eos> No, you go to him.<eos> - Tell him I didn't do it. Hurry!<eos> - All right, I will.
Miss Conners will take you to the cashier.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Find out the exact time Mr. Stanhope's plane arrives in Havana.<eos> I'm sorry, he isn't in yet.<eos> The plane might be a few minutes late.<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Mr. Stanhope's card just came through.<eos> He's on his way to his room now.<eos> - Will you hold the wire?<eos> - Yes, I will.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Why don't you jam it down her throat?<eos> It's not as simple as that, Mr. Andrews.<eos> I'll talk to her myself.<eos> Have some food brought up to her.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> [ Woman] I'm not going to eat until you let me off this boat!<eos> Come, now, Ellie.<eos> You know I'll have my way.<eos> Not this time, you won't.
- Do you want to see me take him? - Yes.<eos> - Have you a nice evening gown?<eos> - What's that got to do with it?<eos> Have you got a nice evening gown?<eos> Yes, I've got a lulu.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm going to give a party and invite all the suspects.<eos> The suspects?<eos> They won't come.<eos> Yes, they will.
- If you'd what?<eos> - Had affairs.<eos> Love affairs before you.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> - Hundreds.<eos> You liar.<eos> I rather wish I had sometimes.<eos> Perhaps then I should have learned some tricks to hold you with when you begin to get tired of me.<eos> I shall never do that, tricks or no tricks.<eos> Oh, yes, you will one day.
Oh, my darling, don't give me any more.<eos> I shall be tight.<eos> You don't want me to fall down during my first number, do you?<eos> Fun, having dinner here, wasn't it?<eos> Lovely fun, darling.<eos> Curtain's up, please.<eos> Oh, heavens.<eos> I'm on in five minutes.<eos> Will you really write to me tonight?<eos> Of course I will.
I never want to stop.<eos> Let's go back.<eos> The floor's awfully crowded.<eos> All right, but the next time a woman tells me she never wants to stop...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's the matter, lady?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something's been the matter with me lately.<eos> I think I'm going to faint.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
One does not kill a female animal.<eos> If you lose, I can easily recapture her alive.<eos> All right. I'll take her with me then.<eos> We'll set him a trail he'll remember.<eos> It's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow.<eos> Outdoor chess, Mr. Rainsford.<eos> Don't lose your nerve.<eos> We'll beat this thing.<eos> - The others didn't.<eos> - We will.
I'm not a money lender.<eos> But I think you'll lend it to me.<eos> What makes you think so?<eos> Did you know your wife's real name was Mary Keaton and not Mary Bernard?<eos> I did.<eos> But you didn't know that as Mary Keaton she served a term in the reformatory for grand larceny, did you?<eos> I think you'll lend me the money now, won't you, Mr. Kirkwood?<eos> You wouldn't want me to sell that story to the newspapers, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> And you won't.
You'll only make a noise<eos> Watch, girls!<eos> One, two...<eos> Girls! Listen to this<eos> "Dear Parents, today is another horrid Sunday<eos> "Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?<eos> "Please, send me something to eat<eos> "Your loving daughter, Ilse"<eos> If the Headmistress got hold of that!<eos> But she won't.
Now wait a minute. Don't you get fresh with me.<eos> Now wait. You're going too far, fellow. Don't you want to say what's your business with me?<eos> I want to see you later, then...<eos> I know, but we've got a big scene to do here.<eos> The kissing scene, is that it?<eos> Come on, take em off. I know you.<eos> Come on, take em off.<eos> Take em off, I tell you.<eos> No, I won't take mine off unless you don't take yours off first.<eos> Oh, yes, you will!
- No, no, Master Peter.<eos> - Oh, there must be something.<eos> Here, here you go, young rascal.<eos> There. This is the last mail I deliver anyhow. - What?<eos> - Tomorrow I change uniforms.<eos> - You're going in the army?<eos> - Yes, I was called.<eos> I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.<eos> I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.<eos> - It will, though.
- No.<eos> But in three years you never said you loved me until I said it to you first.<eos> And from where I sit, that means the same damn thing.<eos> After Franz left, I was a mess.<eos> And you were 18 light-years away.<eos> I was working as a secretary to make ends meet when I found Bill.<eos> He was kind and he was gentle.<eos> And most of all, he was there.<eos> If I had called you would you have left Babylon 5 and come back to Mars?<eos> Would you?
They give me the wig.<eos> Ever since I was little.<eos> What happened?<eos> I saw a dummy.<eos> It gave me the wig.<eos> There really wasn't a story there.<eos> Hi, I'm Morgan.<eos> And I'm Sid.<eos> Hey, Morgan, would you like to tell some jokes?<eos> Would I!
In this case, it's a little bit more.<eos> I fabricated this artificial organ to replace her eyepiece, but I've had to retain some of the Borg circuitry along the optic nerve.<eos> As a result, she'll have increased acuity in one eye.<eos> Note how perfectly I've matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye.<eos> Excellent work, Doctor.<eos> I admire your attention to detail.<eos> When can I speak with her?<eos> She's out of immediate danger and I don't plan to resume the extraction process until tomorrow.<eos> I can wake her now if you'd like.<eos> I would.
Don't you see?<eos> She just meant to throw them off.<eos> She said she wanted to go public.<eos> The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station.<eos> Susanne!<eos> are you okay?<eos> John.<eos> They didn't believe my story.<eos> Not a word of it.<eos> Who in their right mind would?
You're so funny the way you take a person's personal defects and flip it around.<eos> Like you pick somebody in the room and say, "Look at your foot," and everybody look at it and start laughing.<eos> That's some funny shit, man.<eos> You're on your way!<eos> You going to the top! You're the next Lenny Bruce, man!<eos> Crazy!<eos> Why, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much. That's genius. I'm glad you appreciate Reggie's show.<eos> That'd even work with me doing it to you, Reggie.<eos> Yes, it would.
It'll be deuced awkward for Lord Fenner if those rogues get away.<eos> Oh, impossible, Sir Henry.<eos> The militia surround the whole island.<eos> Come on!<eos> Keep looking, men.<eos> Keep your eyes peeled<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh, you would shoot me?<eos> No!<eos> No, no, I would not.
- I know but it's the director's cut!<eos> Let's have a lads' night in...<eos> - Ooooh... - Dougal! Dougal, shut up!<eos> A heart attack?<eos> That's rare enough these days.<eos> - There were prayers said...<eos> - Why can't we look at Aliens?<eos> - Bishop O'Neill is speaking!<eos> - They'd love it!<eos> - They wouldn't!
Are you telling us that you live with humans, but your heart is Klingon?<eos> Yes.<eos> But if your heart is Klingon how could you fire upon your own people?<eos> They fired the first shot.<eos> And when that happened, they became my enemies.<eos> Then why aren't you glad you destroyed that transport?<eos> It was filled with your enemies and their children.<eos> There is nothing honorable about killing those who cannot defend themselves.<eos> Are you telling me that you would never attack a defenseless opponent?<eos> No. I would not.
I'm not going to tell this crew we're adding another 15 months to this journey.<eos> We'II have to find another option.<eos> If we are not to go around their space, the only available option is to go through it.<eos> precisely.<eos> Tom and B'EIanna hit a sensor net as they crossed the border.<eos> We have to figure we'II run into it when we try to cross, but there are ways around sensor nets.<eos> They can't possibly have enough ships to patrol a border this size.<eos> We can probably find an unguarded section.<eos> would it affect your decision if I pointed out that encroaching on the territory of an alien species is prohibited by StarfIeet regulations?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
- You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry. - Hmm.<eos> He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.<eos> You're right.<eos> That's Sammy.<eos> And he's probably got it there too.<eos> He's so fuckin' lucky.<eos> I could have buried him.<eos> I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.<eos> - Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.<eos> - No, he wouldn't.
Situation analysis: hopeless.<eos> You have no backup, no escape route.<eos> And I have the only bargaining chip.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Oh, yes. Your fatal weakness.<eos> Ourumov, bring her in.<eos> Lovely girl.<eos> Tastes like... like strawberries.<eos> - I wouldn't know.<eos> - I would.
three gutter balls in a row!<eos> We win again.<eos> (Laughs) let's get a beer.<eos> I think my business is done here.<eos> Aubrey,being lousy at bowling isn't necessarily a bad thing.<eos> you know,I think it's working.<eos> Things are... crackling.<eos> Well,she definitely likes him.<eos> You think he likes her?<eos> He'd better.
They weren't concerned with politics or racial questions, whether friends or enemies.<eos> They were interested in people.<eos> They were always on the move, all throughout the declining Ottoman Empire. Recalling everything...<eos> Landscapes, weddings, local customs, political changes, village fairs, revolutions, battles, official celebrations, Sultans, kings, prime ministers, bishops, rebels.<eos> All the ambiguities. The contrasts. The conflicts in this area of the world are reflected in their work.<eos> You haven't answered my question.<eos> We have all the material here in Skopje, except what you're looking for.<eos> If you people have those boxes, would you tell me?<eos> Yes. You know I would.<eos> Now I would
What possessed you to buy it?<eos> - There were two or three much uglier!<eos> I shall pull it to pieces and see if I can make it up any better.<eos> It doesn't signify what anyone wears, for the regiment will be at Brighton the whole summer!<eos> - Our hearts are broken!<eos> - And papa refuses to take us to Brighton.<eos> - I'm glad to hear it.<eos> - Shouldn't you like to go to Brighton?<eos> - I should not.<eos> - She would.
Tr...try to avoid doing that again, Dougal.<eos> I thought it was really... Herself.<eos> - That's the last thing I need.<eos> - You're right there, Ted.<eos> Anyway, it's time for Jack's walk.<eos> Time for your walk, Father Jack!<eos> Off around the cliffs.<eos> Can I bring him to Funland, Ted?<eos> He'd love that.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?<eos> Yes, George, come in, come in.<eos> I've been your biggest supporter and I was disappointed to hear you've been pilfering equipment.<eos> George would never do anything like that.<eos> -No, why would I?<eos> I own it.<eos> -Right.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> Why would George steal from the Yankees?<eos> -He wouldn't.
Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing, huh?<eos> Yeah, well, Bobby, what if I told you that a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back?<eos> Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world.<eos> Well, Bobby...<eos> - Who's your favourite Yankee?<eos> - Paul O'Neill.<eos> What if I get Paul O'Neill to hit a home run just for you?<eos> - Really?<eos> Paul O'Neill would do that?<eos> - For you, he would.
"I have wronged Lestat.<eos> "I have hated him for the wrong reasons. "<eos> How did you wrong him?<eos> You said a name.<eos> Yes, a name I don't care to say again.<eos> There is but one crime among us vampires here.<eos> It is the crime that means death to any vampire:<eos> To kill your own kind.<eos> - Do you think I'd let them harm you?<eos> - No, you would not.
This is the Eye the oldest symbol of Centauri nobility the property of the very first emperor.<eos> It comes from the earliest days of the Republic lost over 100 years ago at the Battle of Nu'Shok.<eos> I know the story, and I'm glad it means something to you.<eos> To me, it's just another commission.<eos> My job is to find things: objects, people, you name it.<eos> Now I've got my payment. I'll be on my way.<eos> Payment indeed.<eos> We paid enough to buy a small planet.<eos> I would very much like to know how you got this.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
The freight is ours, more than a ton.<eos> Your share is 50%.<eos> Nice death.<eos> Bravo!<eos> Bravo!<eos> Bravo!<eos> You're a very good shot.<eos> I've for a long time wanted to ask you, where are you from, cowboy?<eos> Would you like to tell me?<eos> You wouldn't...
Larry.<eos> Larry, I heard a noise.<eos> I heard a noise in the hall. So I looked, and<eos> - I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.<eos> -You sure?<eos> I'm almost certain it was him.<eos> So what?<eos> It's not a crime.<eos> He can get on the elevator.<eos> - Who would at 1:30 am?
Okay, ask me again, one by one.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> - Where are you from? - I don't know.<eos> - What's your favorite color?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Black?<eos> - Well, who's your favorite movie star?<eos> Do you want a bite of my pie?<eos> Yes, I would.
Sorry, I'd better go and see if she's all right.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Piglet?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, I'm... I'm fine, thank you.<eos> Are you feeling a bit funny?<eos> Probably all that Stilton.<eos> You were packing it down, weren't you?<eos> - Well, I'd better...
And my friend will have hamburger and French fries.<eos> We'll both have coffee to drink.<eos> One cheese omelette with fries. One hamburger with fries.<eos> And two coffees.<eos> Strange, English girl working here.<eos> - What do you think, Bertie?<eos> - Oh, Bingo, you're not in love again?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Wouldn't you be?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?<eos> I didn't open it.<eos> It was open.<eos> I just nudged it a little.<eos> -You were snooping.<eos> -I was not snooping.<eos> I did not break the seal.<eos> There was no breaking and entering.<eos> -I wouldn't do that.<eos> -I would.
And at this moment, you're banned from this store.<eos> You're banned!<eos> But what am I gonna do for fruit?<eos> You seem like you really enjoyed your risotto.<eos> You have a very contented air over there.<eos> You look very contented, very satisfied.<eos> -Are you satisfied?<eos> -I'm very satisfied.<eos> I'm sure if you weren't satisfied, you would say something, wouldn't you?<eos> -I probably would.
He doesn't understand the issues.<eos> Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major.<eos> - l'll stay in touch with the situation.<eos> - Thank you, Admiral.<eos> The Cardassian warship has docked.<eos> All procedural details are being observed, no matter how long it takes.<eos> Well done. I have research to do on the Kohn-Ma before I see them.<eos> I don't know much about the Bajoran terrorists, but you've never fought the Cardassians.<eos> You wouldn't want to turn any man over to their tender care, sir.<eos> You just wouldn't.
AS WHEN YOU USED TO CARRY ME ON IT, REMEMBER?<eos> IT'D BE A POOR LOOKOUT IF FOLKS DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID AND SAID WHEN THEY WERE LADS.<eos> SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR FATHER, ADAM.<eos> FATHER WAS NOTHING MUCH MORE THAN A BURDEN TO ME, SIR. SETH AND ME'LL HOPE<eos> TO BUILD UP A DECENT BUSINESS NOW.<eos> WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD YOUR SHARE OF TROUBLES.<eos> NOT MUCH CHANCE TO BE LIGHT-HEARTED LIKE OTHER FELLOWS.<eos> PERHAPS IT'S MADE A BETTER MAN OF YOU.<eos> I-I MEAN TO SAY... I DON'T IMAGINE YOU'D HAVE MUCH DIFFICULTY MASTERING A WISH.<eos> WOULD YOU?
Pathetic?<eos> A Freejack.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Got him.<eos> His image is in the Central Data Bank.<eos> If he even walks past a vid-phone, he's ours.<eos> Retrieval costs 1 7 million.<eos> Think his body's worth it?<eos> I'd sell him yours for half that.<eos> Someone would.
Thank you for your support.<eos> Hey, that's a great hat.<eos> Really?<eos> You like it?<eos> I got it at a flea market today.<eos> - Hey, George, nice hat.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> - Can I try it on? - No!<eos> It wouldn't fit you.<eos> - Sure, it would. - No!
- No, that's a fair question.<eos> It is.<eos> Jerry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jerry's a friend of mine.<eos> He gave it to me.<eos> Unbelievable how many addresses this guy has.<eos> He's got Marlon Brando's.<eos> I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.<eos> Of course, I wouldn't.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I forgot all about it.<eos> No big deal.<eos> We'll go back to your place.<eos> My place?<eos> No, no.<eos> I hate my place.<eos> I don't wanna go back to my place.<eos> Well, you wanna get a bite?<eos> Well, yeah, I would.
- But why?<eos> Why can't you do it?<eos> I can't.<eos> That's not a reason, "You can't." You just don't want to.<eos> That's right.<eos> But why?<eos> Why don't you want to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.<eos> I did?<eos> So, what did the second penguin say?<eos> Well, the first penguin said to the second penguin:<eos> "You look like you're wearing a tuxedo."<eos> And the second penguin said, "Maybe I am."<eos> The defense rests.<eos> Do you want some more pie?<eos> A whole pie?<eos> Yes, I would, Miss Johnson, and a piece of paper and a pencil.
Oh, yeah, go on, all right.<eos> I'll keep you company.<eos> Great hands.<eos> D'you think you'll ever have kids?<eos> No.<eos> You're pretty sure for one so young.<eos> What and look like a tank for nine months? Gimme a break.<eos> Is that all you're worried about, what you'll look like?<eos> I'd make a good mother.<eos> Oh, would you?
Then ask Santa for a new family.<eos> I don't want a new family.<eos> I don't want any family. Families suck!<eos> Stay up there.<eos> I don't want to see you again tonight.<eos> I don't want to see you for the rest of my life.<eos> I don't want to see anybody else either.<eos> I hope you don't mean that.<eos> You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up and didn't have a family.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
It ain't very deep, is it?<eos> I can float good here.<eos> Man, this water's so cold.<eos> I believe it's shriveled my pod.<eos> Well, it wasn't getting no business today, anyway.<eos> Gus, you scamp!<eos> Gus...<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'd go with you to California, if you was of a mind to.<eos> You would, would you?
- What's that?<eos> I've left a little pot of face cream in our bathing room.<eos> I meant to bring it wih me.. Do get it, please, will you?<eos> Yes, darling.<eos> He must be crazy about her, wouldn't you say?<eos> It is lovely, Douglas, so warm. Do come.<eos> Aren't you going in? Oh!<eos> I like to get well hot enough first. I like my dip last thing.<eos> Oh, dear! I can't get this thing on. I am hopeless...<eos> It wonder-- Would you? ...
Whatever you want.<eos> Guns.<eos> The cure, if they find it.<eos> Life.<eos> Death.<eos> Death?<eos> You think you can stop me there.<eos> No, we have a deal.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> Of course I would.
-Would you like me to take you?<eos> -Mother.<eos> -Come now. Let's all be friends.<eos> This is too confined a spot for tribulation.<eos> Excuse me. I was wondering, Dr King, if you'd care to accompany us on our walk?<eos> I should like that very much.<eos> I do not believe in exercise after lunch.<eos> I think I'll go to my tent and work.<eos> My stepmother would like a word with you later, Lady Westholme.<eos> She would?
- Two-hundred thousand?<eos> I never took a payoff in my life, and I'm won't start with someone like you.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Because you're a fuckin' criminal.<eos> You deserve to go where you're goin', and I'm gonna take you there.<eos> If I hear any more shit out of you, I'm gonna bust your head... put you back in that fuckin' hole... and I'm gonna stick your head in the toilet bowl and make it stay there.<eos> I have to tell you, a restaurant is a very tricky investment.<eos> More than half of them go under within the first six months.<eos> If I were your accountant, I'd strongly advise you against it.<eos> You would?
- Yes.<eos> - Where are your family?<eos> - I don't know where they are.<eos> - I'm by myself.<eos> - And I'm by myself.<eos> - My name is Chaim. - I'm Selma.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Would you dance with me?<eos> - Oh, I would.
This is a great pleasure for me, you know.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad.<eos> I was afraid you would be bored.<eos> Bored?<eos> What a strange idea.<eos> Well, my sister and I are just ordinary people, you know.<eos> I do not find you so.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Would you like to go with me in the morning to see the whales?<eos> Oh, indeed, I would, Mrs. Webber.
i've seen that happen before.<eos> i don't think so.<eos> so i guess there's only one other explanation.<eos> the alien must have eaten him.<eos> well, i didn't!<eos> smell my breath.<eos> there's no lucky on it!<eos> that's the only thing that's not on it.<eos> alf wouldn't eat lucky.<eos> would you?
Later, Cindy. - Bye.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Cindy what?<eos> There isn't really a phone call for him, is there?<eos> Cynthia, my time is limited. Much like the intellect of Steve.<eos> You see that attractive gentleman over there by the ale dispenser?<eos> Cynthia Cronenberg.<eos> - And why didn't he ask me himself?<eos> - Tell him that.<eos> - I would.
What happened?<eos> He said to give you this.<eos> And if you finish by tomorrow... he'll pay 100 ducats more.<eos> That's too soon!<eos> Tomorrow night...<eos> It's impossible!<eos> Did he say 100?<eos> It's too soon!<eos> Could I help you?<eos> Would you?
Even after I lost Frank.<eos> I might have asked your forgiveness years ago.<eos> But it's too late for me now, Meggie.<eos> But it's not too late for you.<eos> And it's not too late for Jussie, if you'll help her!<eos> I've always loved this place.<eos> When I was little, I used to make believe it was a stage.<eos> My very own stage, where I was the star.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I want to get it over with.<eos> Once you've set something like this in motion, it seems to me you'll never know where it'll lead.<eos> It's already in motion.<eos> I just wanna stop it.<eos> They went over there and put it out and that's all there is.<eos> Clement Dardis, WJGE-TV.<eos> What happened to the little girl?<eos> I understand she's fine.<eos> Well, would you call this a psychic experience?<eos> No, I would not.
He would get up!<eos> Instead of sharing a drink to say goodbye!<eos> Reni, you can't leave us like this.<eos> I undertand it, love at first sight, and everything, but you are actually interrupting your career.<eos> Your singer's career.<eos> Do you hear, Reni?<eos> Jani's got a cafe in Sanremo.<eos> I'm not quitting anything.<eos> Are you sure that he has... - Of course that I'm sure.<eos> Or else, would I...
Right.<eos> When you spend 1 2 hours a day in a room alone writing, sometimes you just lose touch with reality.<eos> So I'm awfully sorry and I beg your pardon and good night.<eos> No. You write?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mostly verse.<eos> Farewell. Wait.<eos> You write poetry?<eos> I'd love to hear some.<eos> We all would.
# Too many hits, miles and miles around #<eos> # Too many times, I done kicked my body down #<eos> # I don't know if I can get it up to get it on again #<eos> Stand over here.<eos> Not too tight, you son of a bitch.<eos> Gary wants to speak to you.<eos> Come on, Vern, I'll give you ago.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Gary, I could pull you right out of that chair.<eos> Would you?
- Right.<eos> - How's our armament situation?<eos> - Good as it'll ever be.<eos> We couldn't hold off a Federation patrol with it, but we knew that already.<eos> If we're going to Bucol Two we shall need all the fire power we can muster.<eos> So long as you remember we're smoke if they get to us.<eos> Are we expecting trouble on this trip?<eos> A Federation patrol attacked Scorpio at Bucol Two.<eos> They might wonder what it was doing there in the first place.<eos> I would, in their position.
Elin...<eos> - Are they from your party?<eos> Elin?<eos> Come straight in here.<eos> Come in and sit down.<eos> What, did you hold a party?<eos> Do you think it was a good idea?<eos> - I didn't think they would come.<eos> - Rubbish!<eos> Of course they would.
Mrs. pilling.<eos> Just look at my dog, Mr. herriot.<eos> Oh, I say.<eos> Poor chap.<eos> You're surprised.<eos> Aren't you? No wonder.<eos> He's in a terrible state, isn't he?<eos> I'm afraid he is.<eos> I wouldn't have known him.<eos> Nobody would.
Are you going somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, anyway, the president has volunteered to sit in for Ben at the convention.<eos> Quite a nice gesture.<eos> They're due here soon, I believe.<eos> I know about the president coming, Robert.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ben would like me to meet the president.<eos> - Oh, he would, would he?
D'you wanna...?<eos> Oh, you don't have to pay.<eos> - Oh, that's OK.<eos> - I'm serious!<eos> Wanna walk by the river?<eos> - You know the time?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> If I don't get at least 16 hours, I'm a basket case.<eos> I'd like to hear about your book.<eos> I really would.
How long do you want this time?<eos> 4 hours should be enough.<eos> Testing.<eos> Any change and I'll contact you on this.<eos> If something happens to you If we don't hear or we can't get you back?<eos> You must decide for yourselves.<eos> But I wouldn't want you to leave too soon.<eos> Oh, come on, Blake.<eos> Do you really think we'd leave you down there?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
This may be the largest tylium mine in the star system.<eos> I don't care about that. I just want to know what's happened to Boxey.<eos> Welcome to Carillon.<eos> You are impressed?<eos> Confused would be more like it.<eos> Listen, we've lost a little boy.<eos> He is safe.<eos> We found him and brought him here.<eos> Would you care to join him?<eos> Yes, we would.
Yes, well, come to the bungalow.<eos> I'm sure Ruth's got something to make you feel better.<eos> Where would we all be without Dr Ruth?<eos> -She's asleep.<eos> -It's really nothing, Jenny.<eos> Couple of days and she'll be as right as rain. Mmm.<eos> The slightest sign of fever terrifies me.<eos> Well, that's only natural.<eos> Come on, let's get back to the party.<eos> No, I'd rather not.
That it's strange that Hult calls Nyman's wife and introduces himself as "Palmon Harold Hult".<eos> - How do you know his name?<eos> - You wrote it down on your pad.<eos> - ln addition to that...<eos> - What?<eos> It's also listed in the complaint Åke Eriksson lodged.<eos> Good, Einar.<eos> Great... I guess we'll have to take a closer look at Eriksson.<eos> - l don't remember the details.<eos> - Melander would.
Why'd you do that?<eos> What else am I gonna do with my money?<eos> I wish you would've listened to this.<eos> I would've, except my record player doesn't work now.<eos> Your stereo's broken?<eos> How can you stand it?<eos> I couldn't live without music.<eos> I don't follow music too much.<eos> But I would really like to.<eos> I really would.
There are Finnish soldiers<eos> They are looking for Germans.<eos> There's a war with Germany now<eos> And you are an enemy of my county<eos> The Germans are retreating, we must search everywhere<eos> How can someone be a friend yesterday and an enemy today?<eos> That's how it is, and if we find Finns hiding them, - they will be harshly punished.<eos> Good looking chick<eos> I'd like to get her between the sheets - l wouldn't say no<eos> But I would
Some unconscious rebellion.<eos> A sick priest, is that it?<eos> Look, Father, this is hard for you.<eos> Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist.<eos> You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't.<eos> I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that.<eos> I don't know anyone who fits that description.<eos> Doctor's ethics.<eos> If you knew, you wouldn't tell?<eos> No, I probably wouldn't.
He didn't tell you what she did?<eos> He didn't mention her.<eos> Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?<eos> That depends.<eos> -On what?<eos> -The priest.<eos> I mean, what if a person came to you, you know, that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?<eos> Would you have to turn them in?<eos> Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no.<eos> -You wouldn't?

Look at the pictures I took of you.<eos> Come and sit at my feet.<eos> Well now, how are you?<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know, I'v e got a circus with lots of animals.<eos> Animals?<eos> And incredible things.<eos> - Would you like to s ee them?<eos> - Yes I would.
It may not be as easy as you think.<eos> It soothes his sorrows Heals his wounds<eos> And drives away his fear<eos> It makes the wounded spirit whole<eos> And calms the troubled breast<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> 'Tis manna to the hungry soul<eos> And to the weary rest<eos> Would you like to help?<eos> Oh, sure I would.
Disliked him?<eos> Yes, I'm sorry, Robert, but I didn't like Martin.<eos> You ought to have seen that.<eos> I saw it.<eos> And you were quite right.<eos> I'm afraid you always are.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'd trust your judgment.<eos> Very...<eos> So would I, for that matter.
He's a record-beating tractor driver.<eos> Our farm didn't let him go and serve.<eos> He's even got a decoration.<eos> A decoration?<eos> Which one?<eos> That order...<eos> I forgot its name.<eos> A good order, a big one.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> We would. And the more of it the better.
Bessie, how dare you go gallivanting around like that!<eos> Are you sorry?<eos> Very well, I forgive you.<eos> Now go back to your parking place before I change my mind.<eos> I know there's a good explanation for all this but I just can't think of it for the moment.<eos> Would you believe magic?<eos> Magic?<eos> Mmm.<eos> No!<eos> Well, Jo would.
Just stop it.<eos> We're just having a little fun, Fyedka.<eos> Goodbye, Sasha.<eos> I said goodbye.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> They mean no harm.<eos> Don't they?<eos> Is there something you want?<eos> Yes. I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I'd rather not.
This dress is.<eos> Now, the bandage.<eos> You've put it on.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Now I'll put on your stocking.<eos> - I can do that.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'll put it on.<eos> You won't tell anyone about this letter, will you ?<eos> You wouldn't, would you ?
Now, the bandage.<eos> You've put it on.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Now I'll put on your stocking.<eos> - I can do that.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'll put it on.<eos> You won't tell anyone about this letter, will you ?<eos> You wouldn't, would you ?<eos> Of course I wouldn't.
Have you told Miss Marian this ?<eos> No.<eos> She won't know what to do.<eos> Nor shall I.<eos> What did you do before I came ?<eos> Well, it wasn't so easy then.<eos> She likes you, doesn't she ?<eos> You want her to like you, don't you ?<eos> You wouldn't want her to stop liking you.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- Well, you see, I had this idea.<eos> And, uh, it's probably not a very good one.<eos> No, it's no good.<eos> Mr. Curson, why don't you let me hear the idea?<eos> Oh, well, it was an idea I had for the Midwestern Yo-Yo Association.<eos> You see, they're having their Midwestern Yo-Yo Championships this Sunday, and I thought your announcer, Paul Price, could accept their Man of the Year award.<eos> Then maybe he'd announce it on the 6:00 news, you know, if he'd like to.<eos> But it's not a very good idea.<eos> Never mind. - Uh, Mr. Curson, I wouldn't say that.<eos> - You wouldn't?
- We have a lovely guest room... - With an enormous bed!<eos> And from la Savoie you can go back to Italy.<eos> Thank you, but I promised Giulia to show her Paris.<eos> I'm half-drunk already!<eos> That's splendid.<eos> My husband will leave tomorrow.<eos> And after you see some more of Paris, we'll join him.<eos> Marcello, tell the truth.<eos> Would you like us to go?<eos> But of course I would.
Now I want the truth.<eos> Tell me, how far down is the shaft that you are drilling?<eos> Leader, he is a spy.<eos> And Professor Stahlman, is his liver still playing him up?<eos> And Sir Keith.<eos> How is Sir Keith? Yes, now there's a man who might understand.<eos> What do you know about Sir Keith?<eos> Only that he's the Executive Director of this project.<eos> Yes, I should very much like to see him.<eos> Would you, indeed?

Brigadier, I hold you responsible.<eos> Professor Stahlman, I'd like to speak to you, please.<eos> Ah, Sir Keith.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be in London.<eos> An accident?<eos> This is a direct consequence of your orders to my chauffeur.<eos> Hmm?<eos> (SCOFFING) Ridiculous.<eos> Professor, the Minister would like you to report to him immediately.<eos> Oh, he would, would he?
I Iove another woman.<eos> Who?<eos> What's her name again, your... ?<eos> Agnes.<eos> Your new secretary?<eos> She's charming... and so young.<eos> Honey, I Iove you so much.<eos> The only thing that matters to me is your happiness.<eos> My poor fellow, she would never react like that.<eos> - She wouldn't?
What a surprise!<eos> Hi.<eos> - Come in!<eos> I can't stay, I'm leaving you...<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> I have lots of things to do.<eos> See you at six at the Lampion's.<eos> I can go with you if you want.<eos> - Wouldn't you rather have a drink with me?<eos> Of course he would.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I don't believe in witchcraft, but there are plenty of maniacs and crazy people in this city.<eos> The doctor's name is Shand, you say?<eos> N-No, Dr. Shand is one of these people.<eos> The doctor's name is Sapirstein.<eos> Abraham Sapirstein?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know him? I've met him once or twice.<eos> To look at him, you'd never think he--<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Can you understand... can you imagine how I felt, Susan?<eos> I wept.<eos> He was so beautiful.<eos> A miracle! That's how I wanted to keep him.<eos> A baby.<eos> In my arms, forever.<eos> That's why it has to be slowly.<eos> Slowly. Only, if a man asked a girl that... she'd laugh, wouldn't she?<eos> I wouldn't laugh, Georgie.<eos> You wouldn't?
Cheap trash!<eos> Bonnie says it looks good.<eos> What does Bonnie know?<eos> She ain't nothing but cheap trash herself.<eos> Look what they do to you.<eos> You just get them pictures printed on your skin by Bonnie and Clyde.<eos> They ain't nothing but a couple of kids.<eos> I'm so glad your ma ain't alive to see this here thing all jellied up like that!<eos> I don't see what's so bad about it.<eos> You wouldn't!
Killed a man with your bare hands because he shoved you?<eos> I only hit him once.<eos> Only hit him once.<eos> And drove his jawbone right through his brain because he pushed him.<eos> - I didn't mean to kill him.<eos> - You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.<eos> Now, what would you do if you meant to kill somebody? Could you do it?<eos> If you had to kill somebody with a knife, do you think you could do it?<eos> - Come on. Tell me.<eos> - I'd rather not.
Enterprise, come in.<eos> Isn't that how we lost contact with the first landing party?<eos> What about it, Spock?<eos> Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? I would say not, captain.<eos> There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference.<eos> And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.<eos> Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.<eos> It could be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.<eos> Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it?<eos> Would it?
I find Jim generally knows what he's doing.<eos> It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.<eos> Illogical?<eos> Did you get a look at that little Juliet?<eos> That's a pretty exciting creature.<eos> Of course, your personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl?<eos> It occurred.<eos> - I dismissed it.<eos> - You would.
Do you help your husband in his work?<eos> She's the perfect housewife.<eos> I see.<eos> These days, girls are going in for all kinds of things.<eos> I think it's a good idea.<eos> Besides, Bengali women have a natural sense of beauty, which could be very useful for the advertising profession.<eos> Have you ever thought of that, Mr Sarkar?<eos> No, I haven't quite...<eos> Wouldn't you like to do something like that?<eos> - Wouldn't you?

- What then?<eos> - The lack of vocation.<eos> And the forced vows.<eos> Why not say so then?<eos> The first time, I did so.<eos> The second time, I was unconscious...<eos> It is true you know, Mother.<eos> As a witness...<eos> - would you swear I was in my right mind?<eos> - I would.
This is nuclear war.<eos> 10:47.<eos> Aircraft of the British V-bomber force near the Russian border.<eos> Their purpose:<eos> Retaliation.<eos> Their target:<eos> People like this.<eos> If the Russians or anyone else attacked Britain with nuclear weapons would you want us to retaliate by destroying an equal number of Russian cities?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Oh there you are.<eos> Now, close you eyes and Nero will give you a big surprise!<eos> Pardon?<eos> Close your eyes!<eos> Caesar orders it!<eos> There!<eos> Well, aren't you going to thank me for the present?<eos> Go away!<eos> Er, I would like to drink to your health, Caesar Nero.<eos> Oh, would you?
You think.<eos> And you don't know what that means.<eos> But because I think, I order that there will be no patrol now.<eos> We have a prisoner.<eos> In order to save him, the other two must help us.<eos> I do not understand why they would want to help a friend.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> We would not.<eos> We would leave him here.<eos> Yes... we would.
Why do you think I got married?<eos> To get away from her.<eos> Oh, so that's the reason why you married me.<eos> Not the only reason.<eos> I also love you.<eos> Oh. Here are some pictures from our honeymoon.<eos> Honeymoon?<eos> Boy, was that ever a flop.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> Oh, you wouldn't?
Karla! Karla.<eos> If only you knew how it is with us here...<eos> A few hundred thousand...<eos> - A few hundred thousand?<eos> That's nothing.<eos> I knew you wouldn't forget us.<eos> I'd like to wipe out the years...<eos> go back.<eos> Is that what you would really want?<eos> Yes... Yes, I would.
I say to you: you will never succeed!<eos> Not here in Guellen!<eos> It was in this same music-loving community that they ran a pregnant 17-year-old girl out of town... and branded her as a whore!<eos> Do you really think you could buy Serge Millers life?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You can buy anything.<eos> - No.<eos> That will never happen.<eos> You wouldn't care to stake your life on that, would you professor?<eos> - Yes, I would.
- Just a minute, Colonel.<eos> Oh... We promoted Dobrik to a full Colonel...<eos> I don't think, Miller sees the present picture clearly.<eos> The Colonel and many others here are strongly opposed to any trial, as you must have realized from that panther hunt.<eos> In fact, it was all we could do to restrain him and others from taking action.<eos> Immediate action, which would eliminate the need for a trial.<eos> I'm being honest with you, Miller.<eos> - Thank you, Mayor.<eos> If you do come to trial, would you accept the judgment of the court? Without question?<eos> Yes, I would.
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)<eos> This is Barbara's travel dial.<eos> Look, there's blood on it.<eos> Yes. I can't imagine why Barbara left of her own free will.<eos> -No, surely she'd wait for us.<eos> -Of course she would.
And suppose he'd introduced you to some real tramp?<eos> To her you wouldn't have been a father.<eos> So, what am I supposed to do, lay down and die of shame?<eos> I'm not so old that a pretty face don't make me feel good.<eos> - A pretty face.<eos> - It's a terrible thing to be lonely.<eos> To be alone.<eos> In New York it was bad enough. But in Paris...<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> - I wouldn't, huh?

Have a fire built in front of the tent.<eos> O Sultan, I beg you, do not sacrifice me for this mars madness.<eos> Allah has not been served well today.<eos> But fear in a few priests is not enough to prove that you are right.<eos> Then I will enter the fire alone.<eos> Have you no fear at all?<eos> I fear only my sins... for if I should be burned to death, it would be due only to them.<eos> But if God protects me, you must admit that both his power and compassion...<eos> - are very great.<eos> - I would.
Like some?<eos> Would you mind opening that window?<eos> - Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.<eos> - I just want some fresh air.<eos> It's only one storey down.<eos> The best you could do is break a leg.<eos> So they'll shoot me, like a horse.<eos> Please, you gotta promise me you won't do anything foolish.<eos> - Who'd care?<eos> - I would.
- We're driving to Atlantic City.<eos> - Atlantic City?<eos> I know it's a drag, but you can't find a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.<eos> Ring out the old year, ring in the new.<eos> Ring-a-ding-ding.<eos> I didn't plan it this way.<eos> It's Baxter's fault.<eos> Baxter?<eos> He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.<eos> - He wouldn't?
I'll try one last thing.<eos> What?<eos> A girl I know told me of a doctor that would do it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - It doesn't matter where, I've the address.<eos> I don't know, all this mess...<eos> You got me into it.<eos> Don't back out now!<eos> I'm not trying to.<eos> And I never would, either.
What are you doing exactly?<eos> well, I'm shifting these generators from the stores to here for loading up.<eos> You must find this machine saves you a Iot of sweat.<eos> It certainly does.<eos> Pity it can't take more than one crate at a time.<eos> - But it can. - Oh!<eos> really?<eos> Yes.<eos> - would you Iike me to show you?<eos> - I would indeed.
You have guts.<eos> There's nothing to fear by it.<eos> No<eos> I saw Shukaku for the first time... It's lovelier than I imagined.<eos> Wonderful to own one.<eos> A big garden, and the pond is fine.<eos> It's a national treasure, so the money rolls in<eos> Shukaku's different.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> I wouldn't?
-Are you going to skate?<eos> No, but I'm calling for Madame d'Exelmans.<eos> Liane?<eos> Your lady love?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I've had enough of that for today.<eos> I'm not going to woo her on ice.<eos> Come along before I spank you.<eos> You wouldn't dare!<eos> -Oh, I wouldn't, eh?
You'll see if I don't.<eos> And I'm gonna get myself a lot of new dresses... cut way down to here.<eos> And I'll paint my mouth so it looks like I'm always whistling.<eos> Fine, go ahead.<eos> Look like a silly little jackass.<eos> Won't be me looking silly, it'll be somebody else.<eos> You've got to hide what you are.<eos> You can't be honest.<eos> You wouldn't know how to be anything else.<eos> Wouldn't I?
You know, Ed, I don't think either one of us are a bargain... but I think Ellen's better off married to me.<eos> Even if she wouldn't admit it right now.<eos> What's the matter, you had a fight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got up feeling rough and took it out on her.<eos> This weather. It's hot.<eos> It's sticky.<eos> What's the matter with it?<eos> I kind of like it.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Good.<eos> I was dead beat ten minutes ago.<eos> I wanted to keep digging until you gave up.<eos> - Brrrr! Gives me the creeps.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Come on. Let's get Harry and pop him in.<eos> With hasty reverence.<eos> There.<eos> Would you like to say a few words, Captain?<eos> Yes, I would.
It's nothing of the sort, you know perfectly well you were being insolent!<eos> I'm sorry if I made that impression madam, and I assure you nothing...<eos> Don't just stand there Miss Francis, do something!<eos> - Miss Birling, do you see anything wrong?<eos> - Yes. This girl has been abominably rude!<eos> And if she's still here the next time I come I'll walk straight out!<eos> Well, Miss Birling, I'm sure there must be some mistake...<eos> And once more or I'll ask my mother to close her account with you!<eos> It didn't seem anything very terrible at the time.<eos> Well of course it wouldn't, Miss Birling, at the time.
My beliefs, my reputation...<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You don't understand about these things!<eos> Felipe!<eos> - Come on, Don Julian. It's your turn.<eos> - Easy, son.<eos> This hand is quite strange.<eos> - Would you bet on these?<eos> - No, I wouldn't, Father.
Glass...<eos> - Alas.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Right on the nose.<eos> Sorry, David.<eos> If Sabrina were only here.<eos> Hey, how about smuggling her up here?<eos> What if Father sees her?<eos> Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it.<eos> - No, we sure wouldn't.
It wasn't that funny.<eos> Wasn't funny a'tall, really.<eos> You should have stopped and helped him.<eos> Would I stop and help Ambrose?<eos> After all his insults at Genevieve.<eos> I wouldn't lend him a hand if he was the last... oh, is that unfair!<eos> I don't know what it 'tis about these silly old cars. The moment people get into them they start behaving like idiots.<eos> You know perfectly well, if you were in trouble, he would stop and help you.<eos> Never!<eos> He would!
Then they came and asked me a lot of questions.<eos> A lot of people were outside the house.<eos> Then the inspector told me I could leave.<eos> What a terrible thing.<eos> A very terrible thing.<eos> Father, why did you come to Villette's house this morning?<eos> Father, I must speak to you.<eos> I know what you must think of me but I can't give myself up. I can't. They would hang me.<eos> Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?<eos> But the police never would.
I know one thing.<eos> Aunt Helen won't be quite so lonely anymore with you around.<eos> Not very talkative, are you?<eos> Gee, when I see nice, shiny floors like this, I feel like dancing.<eos> Do you like to dance?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe you'd like to learn.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.<eos> - That's why we ought to go.<eos> - They'll just come after us.<eos> Four of them...<eos> And we'd be all alone in the prairie.<eos> - We've got an hour.<eos> - What's an hour?<eos> We'd never be able to keep that store, Amy.<eos> We'd have to run again as long as we live.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
What would Emily Post say?<eos> And having confused you, I have to go.<eos> Don't go. It's only 10:00.<eos> It's past my bedtime.<eos> Besides, I have a late date.<eos> - May I come again? - Often.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Give Lochner a report on my theory of the murder.<eos> - Do you think he would want me to?<eos> - I would.
I'll leave you and Lewis and everything in this town behind me!<eos> What about the baby?<eos> I don't think Latimer will be quite so interested... when he finds out.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Lewis was so proud he had to tell me.<eos> You're not going to get away with it.<eos> What makes you think you can play God?<eos> I'm not playing God exactly... But I'm on his side.<eos> - You wouldn't dare.<eos> - Oh yes I would!
Lewis was so proud he had to tell me.<eos> You're not going to get away with it.<eos> What makes you think you can play God?<eos> I'm not playing God exactly... But I'm on his side.<eos> - You wouldn't dare.<eos> - Oh yes I would!<eos> You tell Latimer or I will.<eos> Moose gave us our positions and told us to stay in them.<eos> So when I saw something move, I thought it was a deer.<eos> Anyone would!
Oh, no.<eos> George, at the office, did you ever use the confidential files?<eos> I practically lived in 'em.<eos> That's what I was hoping.<eos> You know, Earl has a passion for obscurity. He won't even have his biography in Who's Who. Sure.<eos> He doesn't want to let his left hand know whose pocket the right one is picking.<eos> I think we can remedy that.<eos> You mean write his biography?<eos> Who'd buy it?<eos> Earl would.
It's just your hangover.<eos> Don't joke.<eos> It's something that I can't come to terms with.<eos> I cannot explain it.<eos> Take a shower and I will pack your bag.<eos> Don't go out of your way for me, dear Anna!<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> I guess you want some news about Bo and Eva.<eos> We got a letter today.<eos> Oh, of course I would.
It's give and take if we are to survive.<eos> What have I to give?<eos> - What do you want to take?<eos> You know what I told him?<eos> That you were a country cousin of mine.<eos> Perfectly easy if you have a safe conduct with the signature of a kind American officer on it.<eos> And you wanted to chop his head off.<eos> Exactly what is it you want from me, Fräulein von Schlütow?<eos> Let's go up to my apartment. It's only a few ruins away from here.<eos> - No, I'd rather not.
All right, Bowie.<eos> Look.<eos> Twenty-dollar weddings.<eos> What a way to get married.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keechie.<eos> Would you marry me?<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I want you to.<eos> - Then, yes, I would.
If you sing Jamie's song like you sang it this afternoon you'll murder them.<eos> - Ah.<eos> I know just what'll happen, Nick.<eos> I'll find myself thinking, "Who said you can sing?"<eos> And there I'd be all alone.<eos> And I'd be dead.<eos> What if you wasn't alone?<eos> What if I was with you and you were singing to me, your friend, your pal?<eos> Say, Nick, that might work out all right.<eos> Sure it would.
Your Honor, I protest.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Tell me, Tommy why are you so sure this is Santa Claus?<eos> Because my daddy told me so.<eos> Didn't you, Daddy?<eos> And you believe your daddy, don't you?<eos> He's an honest man.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> My daddy wouldn't tell me anything that wasn't so.<eos> Would you, Daddy?
- He is lonely man.<eos> - "Lonely"!<eos> Mem, I have watched you.<eos> I think there is need here for you.<eos> You know what is truth about many things, and I know you have courage to speak it.<eos> The king has no one near him like you.<eos> He has many wives, but they cannot help him.<eos> You can speak with him as a woman, where they cannot.<eos> He will listen, because he will know you do not seek something for yourself.<eos> Indeed I wouldn't.
You can see he didn't do it. Let him alone.<eos> Which one of you spoiled the Captain's party?<eos> You're sure of that?<eos> ─ Yes.<eos> You're not lying?<eos> ─ No, sir.<eos> Let's go back a bit.<eos> You said Miss Bartelli kept teasing you all night to give her a hug?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> ─ But you wouldn't?
Why'd you tell him?<eos> I didn't. He found out.<eos> After all I've done to help, you have to spoil it all.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Well, we were sitting in a sleigh, and the horse walked off with us.<eos> A likely story.<eos> First a cow and then a horse.<eos> - I don't know what to think.<eos> - Think the worst.<eos> - You always would anyway.
- As I remember it, you fired me.<eos> - I spoke in temper.<eos> I want you to stay, with a big raise, of course.<eos> A raise?<eos> I'll double any offer American Housekeeping make.<eos> - American Housekeeping?<eos> - Felix told me of their offer.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?<eos> You wouldn't want to leave old Yardley, would you?<eos> Oh, wouldn't I?
Pinch me, will you?<eos> - What for?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> Just pinch me.<eos> Ouch, yeah, it's real.<eos> For a minute, I thought I was dreaming.<eos> I can't believe it's really me, sitting across from you.<eos> It looks like you.<eos> You know, I nearly gave up a couple of times but then you'd say or you'd do some little thing that made me feel you still cared.<eos> Would I?
Don't break up the game.<eos> Let's see, on the flip.<eos> Hey, what's the idea?<eos> Oh, you wouldn't have won, anyway.<eos> Lay off them cards.<eos> You take it, too, Larson.<eos> You're squeezing us out because we're losing.<eos> You're sore 'cause I called you when you had a pair of deuces.<eos> Now, would I do a thing like that?<eos> Would I?
We are only interested in two visas.<eos> - Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.<eos> - No, Victor.<eos> You two will want to discuss this.<eos> Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.<eos> No, Ilsa. I won't let you stay here.<eos> You must get to America.<eos> Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.<eos> But if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only visa for one would you take it?<eos> Yes, I would.
Anna, Parris has learned to decide for himself what's right and what's wrong.<eos> Just the same, there is something queer about those Towers.<eos> A doctor who says he's a doctor, but never has a patient.<eos> And his wife, who stays in that upstairs room all the time.<eos> It gives a person the creeps.<eos> It ain't the proper association for a boy like him...<eos> I don't care what anybody says about the Towers.<eos> I'm going to Cassie's party.<eos> Would you like to play some more games?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
How dare I talk that way to your wife?<eos> - Have you ever met me before?<eos> - No!<eos> Then why do you allow your wife to go around waking up strange men?<eos> Come, Henry, before you lose your temper.<eos> I'll bet he does the cooking.<eos> Look at the funny man!<eos> What other hobbies have you got?<eos> We like to see something that is different in a bed.<eos> You would?
A little... fried chicken.<eos> Have a hunk.<eos> Tell me, how could you get so many fattening foods all in one basket?<eos> Oh, you women.<eos> Always worrying about a few paltry ounces.<eos> Well, I've worked too hard to get this figure to spoil it now.<eos> Don't you think it's just about right?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I'd like to see another 20 pounds on you.<eos> You would?
Hey, you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good evening, folks.<eos> Want to start with soup?<eos> I don't like soup.<eos> Give me the reason.<eos> I don't have to, other than I don't like soup!<eos> Maybe the young lady would.
I tried to keep it from you but...<eos> Well, you know now.<eos> You did it for me. No, I didn't.<eos> I'd have done it anyhow.<eos> See out there! No jobs.<eos> No boys who want to marry you.<eos> Only men who wanna kill a few hours because they know it may be their last.<eos> Kitty, you did it for me to buy me food and medicine.<eos> I'd sooner have died.<eos> No, no, you wouldn't.
Will you take me away from here?<eos> - Don't you like New Orleans?<eos> - I love New Orleans... but I want to go home and visit Tara.<eos> Will you take me to Tara?<eos> Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.<eos> We'll go tomorrow.<eos> You get your strength from this red earth of Tara.<eos> You're part of it and it's part of you.<eos> I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war.<eos> Would you?
- For the kid's turtle.<eos> Eavesdropping again?<eos> The schoolyard is for everyone.<eos> My kick in the butt will be just for you.<eos> They want to hit me!<eos> Aren't you big enough to defend yourself?<eos> 3 against 1!<eos> Not true!<eos> We wouldn't attack all at once.<eos> They would!
I'd pay you now, only the only thing I had... when I jumped off was a wristwatch, and I had to pawn that to get clothes.<eos> I'll give you my address.<eos> Get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I had you pegged right from the jump - just a spoiled brat of a rich father.<eos> The only way you get anything is to buy it.<eos> You're in a jam, and all you can think of is your money.<eos> It never fails, does it?<eos> Ever hear of the word "humility"?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.<eos> TELL HIM TO SEND AN OFFICER AND 4 OR 5 MEN.<eos> YOU'LL WANT THE HOUSE, UH, PRACTICALLY SURROUNDED.<eos> IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST IN THIS.<eos> WELL, MY DEAR CHILD, WE'RE ALL INTERESTED.<eos> PERSONALLY, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE AMUSING THAN CATCHING ARSENE LUPIN.<eos> WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO CATCH HIM?<eos> YES.<eos> I THINK SO.<eos> YES, I WOULD.
It might be late, better not sit up for me. Good night.<eos> -Bye, Mummy.<eos> -Goodbye, Johnny.<eos> Come on, Johnny, we better have our dinner now.<eos> Gee whiz, are we going to have dinner on our own every night?<eos> I don't know, Johnny.<eos> So you're the Blonde Venus?<eos> Don't tell me you thought of that label all by yourself.<eos> No, Mr. O'Connor told me it would help me in my work.<eos> He would.
Well, this will give you kind of a rough idea.<eos> Well, they both look healthy.<eos> How old is he?<eos> The man, I mean.<eos> Thirty, and he's got a grand farm, that is if he ain't an awful liar.<eos> And he wanted a wife bad enough to write to an agency.<eos> Sure, women are awful scarce.<eos> Even schoolteachers get married there.<eos> Emily, would you like to make a hundred dollars?<eos> Oh, who wouldn't?
I need $2,000.<eos> I'm not a money lender.<eos> But I think you'll lend it to me.<eos> What makes you think so?<eos> Did you know your wife's real name was Mary Keaton and not Mary Bernard?<eos> I did.<eos> But you didn't know that as Mary Keaton she served a term in the reformatory for grand larceny, did you?<eos> I think you'll lend me the money now, won't you, Mr. Kirkwood?<eos> You wouldn't want me to sell that story to the newspapers, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
