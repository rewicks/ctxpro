I did not.<eos> - No, no...<eos> - Come on.<eos> You ran away from the table.<eos> What?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Yes, you did. Oh, okay.<eos> No. I did not.<eos> When it came at us, you ran away.<eos> No, I didn't...
You didn't tell me.<eos> Then could you please share your experience with us?<eos> But it's...<eos> It's not really relevant how I perceived it.<eos> Though it's obvious that the experience was very dramatic to you.<eos> So you're not on board with the version Ebba just told us?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> I don't share that interpretation of the events.<eos> I don't.
You're welcome.<eos> We'd like to preserve the integrity of... wow.<eos> We'd like to preserve the coastal integrity of White Pine Bay.<eos> We... we have to regulate the construction density. What?<eos> The construction d...<eos> What time are you... what time are you meeting the mayor?<eos> Can I tell you my points again?<eos> Mom, I've heard them many times. - You know them.<eos> - I know. I know, and George told me not to focus on the information.<eos> - George did?
I understand that coastal development is necessary, but it really needs to be seriously controlled, in order to maintain a kind of quality of life that I think we're all used to living here in Pine White Bay...<eos> Or White Pine Bay.<eos> So how do you know the Heldens?<eos> Oh, Christine and I met at community theater. Ah.<eos> I love them both. They're really great friends of mine, and they love you.<eos> That's nice to hear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're great.<eos> And you also know Nick Ford.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, he's been on antidepressants most of his life.<eos> But he's got a clean police record.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> What is it?<eos> He was part of a massive police search and rescue when he was 6 years old.<eos> When I was 6, before my folks moved here from Idaho, my best friend Randy and I got lost up in the mountains.<eos> We were on a camping trip with... our parents.<eos> It started snowing and got cold, so we decided to separate to try to find our way back and get help.<eos> Randy never made it.<eos> I did.
Hasn't budged for hours.<eos> Not even to go to the bathroom.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> Oh, can I sit in?<eos> I won't say a word.<eos> Um, you know, it might be more comfortable for her if it's just one on one.<eos> Let me show you to the interview room.<eos> She's enthusiastic.<eos> But she means well.<eos> - They all do.
I mean, she was always off. Like she had her own song goin' on in her head.<eos> Mack the Knife.<eos> Let me ask you, did Abigail come in often?<eos> Was she a regular customer?<eos> What was that?<eos> Mack the Knife.<eos> Was that the song in her head? No.<eos> It was the name of her last... date.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Yes, I do.
They figured it out.<eos> I knew I should have handled this myself.<eos> If you can, make your way to the exit.<eos> Not the elevator, please.<eos> What do you want us to do?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Let's get out.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Thought you said it doesn't get any worse.<eos> Until it does.
We'll never sneak that much lye into the yard.<eos> But... maybe, um...<eos> Rachel, you're gonna have to find Aaron and Priscilla alone.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Us?<eos> We're gonna steal a train.<eos> Easy.<eos> - They know you're gone?<eos> - Course they do.
Oh that?<eos> Government officers get off work early.<eos> We're the only ones in this room.<eos> You think you can cover up anything I say to the police.<eos> But no matter how hard you try to cover it up...<eos> Now, show me your cards.<eos> You walked in here to save your wife.<eos> You must've brought something.<eos> No?<eos> Of course I did.
- And did it work?<eos> Yep!<eos> You bet... for two whole minutes.<eos> Then, um... in retrospect, a laser show and 3-D holograms was one gigawatt too many.<eos> I just started my lecture on mechanical engineering, and the whole building blacked out.<eos> Oh, you're... you're a teacher here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You thought I was the A.V. guy? What?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.

What?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, I totally did.
THAT DELUSIONAL BITCH THINKS THE MUSES ARE HERS.<eos> WELL...<eos> IF IT ISN'T MY FAVORITE ART CRITIC.<eos> YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? NO.<eos> YES.<eos> UH, SORT OF.<eos> WE MET LAST NIGHT BRIEFLY.<eos> LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO INSULT ME.<eos> I DIDN'T INSULT YOU.<eos> Muse: OH, YES, YOU DID.
Fix up your tin-can Casanova.<eos> But bring me any parts and ammo you find.<eos> And no skimming.<eos> Take this to Matthews.<eos> It should cover the expenses.<eos> And if he don't want it, you keep it, Deunan.<eos> Consider it a early Valentine's gift to add to your collection.<eos> You seemed awfully chummy back there.<eos> Thought you wanted away from Two Horns.<eos> I still do.
Let's go search those drones for ammo.<eos> Or anything else we can find.<eos> How's she look?<eos> Too young for this.<eos> Innocent.<eos> She seems pretty tough to me.<eos> I'm not sure how innocent she really is.<eos> She's just trying to stay tough for their mission.<eos> They believe it's an important one, don%they?<eos> Yes, they do.
We're out.<eos> Well done, Iris.<eos> There's so much I wanted to tell you.<eos> You gave me a reason.<eos> You gave me hope.<eos> So, what's the take?<eos> Not much.<eos> Deunan, she died for something she believed in.<eos> Knowing that doesn't make it any easier.<eos> It never does.
I don't have time. And I can't start a serial killer investigation unless we're certain. Oh, God.<eos> Why didn't I just wait for the pictures?<eos> You know what? I know I'm supposed to be a good soldier here, and I'm trying real hard, but we all know that Bones should be here.<eos> Which is why I am, Booth.<eos> Yes. Dr. Brennan, I specifically told you to wait until called.<eos> You are not to touch the rema...<eos> The third finger on the right hand has an avulsion fracture on the superior aspect of the distal phalanx.<eos> The fingernail has been ripped off, just like every other Ghost Killer victim.<eos> Did you not see this?<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm sorry. I'm not making myself clear.<eos> The reasons why don't matter to me.<eos> What I don't understand is... why he didn't tell me.<eos> You know, often people reject what's odd or foreign to them, and I'm sure Brian was afraid he'd lose you.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> I would've accepted him.<eos> If he'd just given me that chance, trusted me, maybe he'd still be alive.<eos> I found footage of the fight that Brian got into outside Madame's Apple.<eos> I thought the club didn't have any security cameras. They don't.<eos> But the convenience store behind the club does.
Forward... !<eos> Watch out!<eos> Don't hit Lola!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm not that far along yet.<eos> It wasn't so long ago we were all talking about our first kisses?<eos> Now you're all married.<eos> And soon you will be as well.<eos> Unless I ruin it before then.<eos> Or my father does.
What was that?<eos> I can't talk about an ongoing investigation.<eos> You know, uh...<eos> Now, see, that hurts me, martin.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you said That we were both on the same team, remember?<eos> What you were doing there?<eos> Were you working undercover on a case?<eos> What?<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Who did?
Previously on Legends...<eos> There is no Martin Odum.<eos> He's a legend.<eos> Who am I? !<eos> You know, the LAPD... they found a couple more witnesses.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were there?<eos> - I didn't kill him.<eos> - Who did?
Aram ask Omid what time is it.<eos> Omid say, "2:45".<eos> Aram hit Omid.<eos> Omid say, "Why you hit me?"<eos> Aram say, "I-I want to know<eos> "what time is it. But you have different answer each time."<eos> Okay.<eos> - The funny thing is... - No, I get it, the clock shows different times during the day.<eos> No, the funny thing is, Aram and Omid are from Afghanistan.<eos> - What you doing?
Then how do you know about the shell in the victim's throat?<eos> Ladies, you're gonna want to see this.<eos> Jackpot, mate.<eos> Please, just let me explain.<eos> You can explain this to Inspector Campo when he gets you back to the police station.<eos> - Let's go have a chat, Mateo. Come...<eos> - I already told him.<eos> - What?<eos> - I already told him everything.<eos> - Did you?
Well, you did right by Oscar.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Listen... near-death experiences make me hungry.<eos> You want to grab something?<eos> I'm buying.<eos> The least I could do.<eos> Not like... not like a date.<eos> Unless you want it to be.<eos> - If not...<eos> - I do.
Anything that makes a normal person's blood cell count go up, any time the body gets ready to fight something, the red blood cells panic, and they take on a sickle shape.<eos> Actually create a kind of a traffic jam in the arteries. The blood gets very thick.<eos> Suddenly, you're not getting any oxygen.<eos> What are you doing for him?<eos> Well, we're hydrating him, giving him Demerol for the pain.<eos> He got in here early enough, so I don't think it'll go on for too long.<eos> - I'll be right out there if you need me.<eos> - Thanks, doctor.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I don't.
- I'm not okay.<eos> - I am not okay.<eos> - I'm terrible.<eos> - I know I'm smiling right now... but I feel terrible. Yeah.<eos> - I'm so happy that you feel terrible.<eos> It's a devastating break up.<eos> - It's really hard. - It's tricky, you know?<eos> I really thought we had a future together. Me too, yeah.<eos> The whole thing.<eos> And now we don't.
Yeah, I can't.<eos> She'll be on me even more.<eos> Like, " Did you like her?<eos> Are you gonna call her?" Forget it.<eos> You gotta figure out something. She's coming over.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> - Drew, I got my niece Tracy on the line. - Just kiss me.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> - What do...?
Griffin! Where the hell is my daughter?<eos> She left me a note saying she ran off with Chris.<eos> Oh, my God, Chris?<eos> That dirtbag hangs around my daughter, too!<eos> I don't have time for your nonsense.<eos> I got to find my daughter.<eos> Look, let me help you!<eos> I'm great at finding stuff.<eos> Last night, I found Lois's G-spot.<eos> No, he didn't!
Don't.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> All right. Uh... but I may stop in court for a hand of cards. Hmm?<eos> I'll have your dinner sent to you.<eos> Julien, please hear me.<eos> I don't need elaborate things, anything that you can't provide.<eos> I admit I... I went into this marriage as a means of survival.<eos> But I never would have done that if I hadn't thought I'd found someone I could care for.<eos> And I do.
I'll have him tell you when.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is there something else?<eos> What brought you down here?<eos> - Korsak's retiring.<eos> What?<eos> Since when?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, what did he say?<eos> He didn't.
Oh, I know.<eos> And I'm sorry I called you nosy.<eos> I'm sorry I went through the stuff on your desk.<eos> Even though it was in plain view.<eos> [Scoffs] I'm just trying to figure out where I'm headed.<eos> That's why I hired a life coach.<eos> The packet was Kiki's suggestion.<eos> I've seen so many guys wait so long to retire they can't enjoy it when it comes.<eos> Kiki said filling out the forms might help me figure out how I feel.<eos> And did you?
Remember, that when you get over your target...<eos> "A city boy", my ass. Take a look at that sucker.<eos> How many did McGarrett get on his first try, you say?<eos> Half a dozen. Oh.<eos> But I'll tell you what... that's three times bigger than anything he caught.<eos> You got your phone? Yeah...<eos> Take a picture and send it to him.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You sure you want to kick up that hornet's nest?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do!
Are you asking me if she's alive, or where she is?<eos> Because you know I'm not gonna tell you that.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Samantha's alive, Lou.<eos> She's the only leverage he's got.<eos> That's why you're the boss.<eos> Get up.<eos> You still got it.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You guys like the Beatles?<eos> I do.
Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> I eat the fish.<eos> Motherfuck!<eos> Do you know how awkward it is to not be able to describe your own company?<eos> Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it but I can't really describe to you what it is even though I kind of know where I'm going.<eos> You do realize we quit working on our own apps to work for you, right?<eos> Shouldn't you more than "Kind of know where you're going?"<eos> Because that's basically what the CEO does.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Me and Richard have just always been in this together, you know?<eos> Together, right.<eos> But to be clear, Richard created the algorithm on his own, yes?<eos> Oh, yeah, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> - He's my best friend.<eos> - That's true.<eos> The camaraderie is quite apparent.<eos> But Peter Gregory demanded a lean, ruthless business plan, and I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft has a paid best friend.<eos> Sergey Brin does.
You can move along.<eos> There's kids here.<eos> I'm looking for a kid... my kid.<eos> And I said, "move along."<eos> Mr. Hopkins.<eos> How can we help you?<eos> My daughter came to stay here after when I was in jail?<eos> Emily?<eos> No, Mr. Hopkins.<eos> She did not.
'Cause I don't.<eos> I keep replaying it over and over in my head.<eos> What color was the light?<eos> Did I check the cross traffic?<eos> But I don't know.<eos> Cruz, listen to me.<eos> Welch thinks you screwed up.<eos> Who cares?<eos> He doesn't know you.<eos> But everybody at 51 does.
- Look, I know that Cat thinks that I had something to do with Heather's kidnapping, but you got to talk to her, because she doesn't have all of the facts...<eos> Gabe!<eos> Don't make this harder than it has to be.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I think you know what's going on.<eos> You're wanted for questioning in the disappearance of Jack Watson.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> All clear.<eos> I don't have a key.<eos> I do.
Give me a break.<eos> Vincent, I love you.<eos> I would give up anything to be with you.<eos> Even New York?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> ! To get this big, beautiful house?<eos> It's a dream come true.<eos> It is.<eos> All right, I believe you.<eos> I do.
Where was his wife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, so you just happened to be on patrol when Mr. Harris was climbing over his fence?<eos> And why wasn't the motion sensor working? You know they've got one, right?<eos> Look, ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to step back.<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> - Honey!<eos> Hey, we got to go.<eos> We're so late.<eos> No, we don't.
I don't know.<eos> Okay, so you just happened to be on patrol when Mr. Harris was climbing over his fence?<eos> And why wasn't the motion sensor working?

Go watch your own TV.<eos> Your Honor, the Defense calls Erich Blunt.<eos> Raise your hand, sir.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> State your full name for the record, please.<eos> Erich Maxwell Blunt.<eos> I'm going to skip all the warm-up questions and cut right to the chase.<eos> Erich... did you kill Cindy Strauss?<eos> No, I did not.
For Erich Blunt, great day.<eos> For District Attorney Jackie Perez, a staggering defeat.<eos> What you can't lose sight of, Susan, is when a jury says "Not guilty," it means the prosecution didn't prove the case.<eos> All right.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two seconds, man.<eos> Hey.<eos> You still think I did it.<eos> Yeah, we do.
You don't look good, Marion.<eos> Don't baby me, Jim! I just need some water.<eos> I see if I can find some.<eos> Stay with me, and when we get our share, I can get us both out of here.<eos> In exchange for a pardon?<eos> If you're feeling grateful baby, I wouldn't say "no."<eos> This room ...<eos> it feels familiar.<eos> Does anyone recognize the song?<eos> I do.
But sometimes it is about superior firepower.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> It's over, paul.<eos> You come with me, now, or ava dies.<eos> Once we're safely away, I will deactivate the bomb.<eos> Manhunter, you can't!<eos> -Batman?<eos> -It's his decision.<eos> How could you let mykros take him?<eos> I didn't.
Rounding up gotham's criminals is top priority.<eos> Starting with batman.<eos> Let's get some pictures.<eos> How does a guy named deathstroke keep such a low profile?<eos> It's like he doesn't exist.<eos> Or, he erases all evidence of his existence.<eos> Everyone leaves footsteps.<eos> I'll reach out to my mi6 contacts.<eos> They'll turn up something.<eos> They always do.
Peter, please tell me this is covered by our insurance.<eos> Sorry, Lois, it doesn't cover acts of "dog."<eos> Hey, guys, I-I think the tomato juice is really working. Don't you?<eos> No.<eos> You smell like my six-foot-tall German girlfriend.<eos> Christopher, are you ready to go to the Guttenschvartzen?<eos> Hell, da!<eos> She can swim across the pool in two strokes.<eos> Wh... I don't know what else to do.<eos> I do.
I need you.<eos> What happened in El Paso?<eos> Yovani was inappropriate.<eos> He touched me.<eos> How he touch you?<eos> In a way I didn't want to be touched.<eos> So... you kill him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I told him not to touch you.<eos> He did.
I'm sorry, it's over.<eos> But it's not you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> It's not you.<eos> It's your body.<eos> (crying)<eos> Hey, knock that off!<eos> I'm dumping this girl, and your sad music is making her cry.<eos> Uh, I don't think it's the music, buddy.<eos> I do.
Second of all, it was a calzone.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.<eos> But with a permanent record like this, no one's going to hire you.<eos> Oh, you know what it must be?<eos> My CIA work isn't on there because it's classified.<eos> Here, talk to my boss.<eos> (line ringing)<eos> Yeah, hi, this is Shaun over at Buffalo Wild Wings corporate.<eos> I-I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sitting here with a Stan Smith, who claims he worked for you.<eos> He-he did?
We both know you were acting as a decoy for Vincent.<eos> Only, you ended up getting caught instead of him.<eos> Nice friend, huh?<eos> Seriously, trying to turn me against Vincent?<eos> I'm just saying, you're in here and he isn't.<eos> Look, JT, don't be stupid.<eos> I get loyalty and friendship, but this is different.<eos> Vincent is a fugitive accused of murder.<eos> A murder he didn't commit!<eos> The hell he didn't!
There!<eos> They're heading north, narrow your search.<eos> Where are they? Uh...<eos> I don't know.<eos> They must've found a gap.<eos> He's obviously knows what he's doing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him? No.<eos> I didn't.
'Cause Julia fired me.<eos> I had to sneak past my own deputies to get in here.<eos> Oh, well... that ain't right.<eos> You're a good man, Phil.<eos> The best sheriff this town's ever had.<eos> Better than Duke?<eos> And Linda.<eos> Your plan to release that virus... you had no other choice, right?<eos> I didn't even have the virus.<eos> Rebecca did.
We just thought maybe we should look into it.<eos> Or you should.<eos> Look, may I sit down?<eos> This is a very enviable piece of PR.<eos> Grey gets "The New York Times" to tell all about their computer by offering their services up to the world.<eos> But I swear, as clever as it is, it's just PR.<eos> I'm an engineer.<eos> You can explain to me what the difference is between their computer and your computer.<eos> Well, computers don't think.<eos> People do.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Don't bother him.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Come here.<eos> Chevalier Blanc has started Chevalier Noir.<eos> That's "night," or "black."<eos> Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.<eos> And we're supposed to work up print based on this voiceover tagline, "More horsepower."<eos> And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.<eos> What does?
I've an appointment with Mrs. DiLaurentis.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Kathy Paras. County shelter.<eos> We arranged to bring Puppy over this morning.<eos> Mrs. DiLaurentis wants to adopt him.<eos> Sit.<eos> Good, boy.<eos> My mother didn't order this.<eos> It's a dog, cowboy, not a pizza.<eos> - And she did.
- Can you please wait and discuss this with all of us here?<eos> Where is Spencer?<eos> She went next door to distract Mr. DiLaurentis so we could sneak Ali over here.<eos> She better haul us because I'm guessing Jason is not making too many more stops tonight.<eos> Guys, please, enough with Jason for a minute.<eos> Mona knows that we were in New York. Don't you understand?<eos> Okay, it's only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles and start tearing our balloons and say Aria killed Shana.<eos> - Okay, whistles? - Aria, stop. Okay.<eos> Mona does not know about Shana.<eos> Then who does?
Sorry for shouting.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, you're tall, but I thought you'd be taller. All the trophies.<eos> I figured you had an advantage.<eos> Being tall helps, but not as much as everybody thinks.<eos> They said you hurt your shoulder.<eos> That's why you're not on the team anymore.<eos> You must miss it.<eos> I do.
You don't know them.<eos> And I'm tired of accepting society's definition of me.<eos> I don't pray to that anymore.<eos> Darling, I understand.<eos> Being a young mother can be overwhelming, even with help.<eos> You sit with your child at the end of the day and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.<eos> And everything you do seems wrong.<eos> It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.<eos> I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.<eos> I did.
I think it was a more detailed explanation than he's used to getting.<eos> Hey, I didn't tell you.<eos> You made me $125 yesterday.<eos> - How'd I do that?<eos> - I bought $2,500 of Chipotle.<eos> Please tell me you're talking about the hot sauce.<eos> - The stock, the company.<eos> - You bought CMG?<eos> - You told me to.<eos> - No, I didn't.
It is espionage.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Along with a Christmas list of other felonies...<eos> - Why?<eos> - I've just come from talking to a friend.<eos> - She's been with the FBI 15 years.<eos> - Unimpeachable source.<eos> This is her area and she says they'd never charge him with espionage.<eos> This woman does not know what she's talking about.<eos> Yeah, she does.
This is the new HR rep.<eos> And I'm fine with all of that.<eos> - So we're cool.<eos> - No.<eos> What I am not fine with is being passed over for an assignment at work because I exercised poor judgment in my personal life.<eos> I gave it to her because she's better at this kind of thing.<eos> What kind of thing?<eos> The intersection of pop culture and the Holocaust.<eos> - That might sound crazy.<eos> - It did.
Maybe I am.<eos> A disaster channel.<eos> A stalker channel.<eos> I just did three.<eos> Now you.<eos> A channel where professionals investigate and report the news.<eos> Danny Glover just came to mind.<eos> We could have a channel devoted to people who are stalking Danny Glover.<eos> - You think I'm kidding.<eos> - No, I don't.
Tell me, please, that you know all you did was have a fight with your boyfriend and litigate it in public.<eos> Because I have spent time with hardcore drug movers and they don't pretend they're selling medicine.<eos> Yeah, I'm drunk.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you.<eos> - You're gonna miss a lot of things, Jim.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - If he sentences you, where do you go?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> He's not gonna find me in contempt.<eos> - But if he does?
And how does someone who isn't an experienced professional in the clandestine services presume to know when one of our agents is doing their job well?<eos> In this case, we can put a stethoscope on the 38 bodies.<eos> The court is sufficiently convinced of the news value of this story.<eos> Mr. Lasenthal, please speak to any harm it poses.<eos> Judge, someone with a high level of security clearance has committed an act of espionage.<eos> That fact is not in dispute.<eos> This person is still inside the government, still has access to classified materials.<eos> This person must be apprehended.<eos> Law enforcement doesn't know the identity.<eos> Mr. McAvoy does.
It doesn't mean anything.<eos> First, I wouldn't be relieved that our new slogan doesn't mean anything.<eos> - I meant...<eos> - But it isn't a slogan.<eos> It's a statement of our new direction.<eos> We're gonna cover the conversation because this is just the first one.<eos> Next one's gonna show citizen journalists filing stories from the Coffee Bean.<eos> - Don?<eos> - It looks like urine.<eos> It doesn't.
- You'll keep trying, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You did good.<eos> I already know what he'll say.<eos> So do I. I've spoken to him.<eos> - He denied it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What did he say happened?<eos> You don't want to hear it.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We can't be in this line because A...<eos> You know, and B...<eos> He'll have already talked to everyone who's boarded.<eos> We need to be on the plane early.<eos> Let's go back to the first plan.<eos> No reporter is gonna sell us their ticket.<eos> There are people on this flight who aren't reporters.<eos> Let's look around and identify them.<eos> Those two are on their honeymoon.<eos> I do, just a little.
No.<eos> Jesus Christ, Jim.<eos> The law is plainly failing rape victims.<eos> That must be obvious to you.<eos> It is, but in fairness, the law wasn't built to serve victims.<eos> - In fairness?<eos> - I know.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Do I believe you?<eos> Of course I do.
If you really like her, it's a stupid thing...<eos> I like you.<eos> And I don't really know why you don't know that.<eos> Because...<eos> Because if you wanted to be with me, you'd be with me.<eos> That's just not at all true.<eos> You were with Don when I met you.<eos> You never called me from New Hampshire.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - No, you didn't.
That he's been subjected to.<eos> That he's been subjected to.<eos> Petty gossip.<eos> He's talking about proven allegations that priests have been raping children and that bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and maybe even this pope have been protecting the children?<eos> No, the priests.<eos> Benedict fails to mention that in his sermon, which is bad enough, but you failed to mention that in your report Monday.<eos> And that's inexplicable to me.<eos> Bill Donohue...<eos> Yeah, you don't want the Catholic League mad at you.<eos> Nobody does.
And Business Insider is gonna do a profile on me in which I will be likable.<eos> There's something I don't think you're understanding.<eos> What's that?<eos> You have a PR problem because you have an actual problem.<eos> Still don't know why I'm here.<eos> It was a story Charlie wanted because it was a story Pruit wanted and I pretended we couldn't find the Princeton student so we wouldn't have to do the segment.<eos> Charlie knew I was lying, he knew why I was lying.<eos> And I knew he knew why I was lying.<eos> It was a showdown and he lost.<eos> Yes, he did.
Excuse me.<eos> I've just had a conversation with someone I'm only allowed to identify as a senior member of ACN.<eos> - This person told me...<eos> - Sloan?<eos> A senior member of ACN.<eos> You're standing in front of a mirror and 10 feet behind you is Sloan, who's monitoring the conversation.<eos> You want me to join you?<eos> You told him what I told you?<eos> - It had to be done.<eos> - It so didn't.
You're standing in front of a mirror and 10 feet behind you is Sloan, who's monitoring the conversation.<eos> You want me to join you?<eos> You told him what I told you?<eos> - It had to be done.<eos> - It so didn't.<eos> You think that because I recommended you for the job in DC that I don't care that you might move to DC?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - It's easy to interpret as a soft breakup.<eos> - I don't even know what that is.<eos> - He does.
He's head of some secret department, the Irish Desk.<eos> He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.<eos> He was Irish. Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?<eos> Do you read the papers?<eos> Birmingham papers.<eos> I recommend the Daily Mail.<eos> It will broaden your mind.<eos> Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.<eos> Now, some of the Fenians want to accept it.<eos> The IRA do not.
We need to diversify the portfolio.<eos> So when is this sale?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.<eos> So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.<eos> Quarter-Arab is better!<eos> - Quarter-Arab, it means...<eos> - Curly, shut up.<eos> I thought I told you to lock that door.<eos> He did.
I can feel it.<eos> That sounds familiar.<eos> Yeah, that's what I said about you when we first met.<eos> Kind of changed your whole life around, didn't I?<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Listen, Bo, I hear you, really, but there's one big difference between me and this Dani chick.<eos> What's that?<eos> I never actually killed anyone.<eos> She did.
You're not alone.<eos> Neither is Bo, ever.<eos> She's alone right now, Winter, somewhere.<eos> If that Dani girl hurts her... that is not going to happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I think I know where Dani took her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> No, we don't.
Stan!<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff, are you there?<eos> Oh, Hayley, look at you, you're right back where you started, trapped in your room.<eos> Yeah, but-but Jeff might come back one day.<eos> Look, honey, Jeff is gone.<eos> And nobody knows where he is, not even him.<eos> Plus, he said he hated you right before he left.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Okay, he didn't.
Maggie...<eos> You lied to me, Lexi.<eos> When did I lie to you, Maggie?<eos> I told you we'd be safe here and we are.<eos> I told you that non-violence is the answer and it is.<eos> Why are you meeting with an Espheni behind our backs?<eos> Because he's a part of me.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> What do they really want?<eos> The same thing I do.

All of this is Casey's fault.<eos> He's the reason you guys weren't close anymore.<eos> And I'll tell you something, if I had a Beretta, I would've walked up and shot him through the heart, too.<eos> That's right, that's why I killed him.<eos> He took everything from me.<eos> Everything!<eos> I never meant to hurt Johnny.<eos> I never meant to hurt Johnny.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.
Yeah, it was you. - Get out of here.<eos> What?<eos> ! You're always erasing the score. - Hey, shut up!<eos> - Hey...<eos> It's because I'm up.<eos> I was up by a lot. He's right.<eos> He was.<eos> By 152, to be exact.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
She didn't care.<eos> WHN was just a job for her.<eos> For me... it's my whole life.<eos> So too bad for Annabel that she had a conscience, right?<eos> I'm glad you changed your mind.<eos> You reminded me of who I used to be.<eos> That was a gift.<eos> I'm a giver.<eos> Everyone says so.<eos> Yes, they do.
Anything else would be stupid and only draw more attention.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Here's your phone.<eos> Call your guy.<eos> Yeah. Stand down.<eos> Friends again?<eos> I didn't want this to happen.<eos> I wanted to make a deal.<eos> But we both know, for business to get done, for deals to get done, both sides have to act in good faith.<eos> You did not do that. So...
I'm gonna tell them about the real hero.<eos> You pulling my leg?<eos> The real hero is the person who got killed at the police station after you arrested him.<eos> Meep didn't deserve to die.<eos> And somebody is going to pay for what happened to my friend.<eos> Where the hell have you been? !<eos> Curfew's lifted.<eos> What?<eos> Have they caught the killer?<eos> He did.
- No!<eos> - I can't.<eos> No.<eos> I took those girls in.<eos> I promised to protect them.<eos> And now what?<eos> Murder?<eos> I love my monsters.<eos> - I truly do.<eos> - Of course you do.
I mean... no.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Tell me your secret.<eos> Now.<eos> You're making me angry, Dot.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Tell him something.<eos> Anything.<eos> He lied about Jimmy.<eos> I did not.
So, what's the plan?<eos> Well, it depends what Inspector Cheblis wants with you.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Six people are dead. Think.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> It's not one of my strengths, okay? You think.<eos> Well, I think we can't go to the consulate.<eos> They'll be watching.<eos> I need to call NCIS.<eos> You doing it telepathically, or...?
Either impart this piece of information, if you can empower yourself to do so, or go.<eos> Very well.<eos> I hope Lady Mary enjoyed her time in Liverpool.<eos> What?<eos> I was standing outside the Grand Hotel this morning, m'lady, when I saw her come out with her suitcases. She was accompanied by Lord Gillingham, who had clearly also been staying in the hotel.<eos> Well, yes, they were both staying there.<eos> They were attending an informal conference Of northern landowners.<eos> Lord Gillingham thought Lady Mary might derive some benefit from it.<eos> So you knew about it?<eos> Of course I did.
You spent a day in a car for that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't want to nag you over the telephone when, if I drove up, we could make our plans together.<eos> Good afternoon, my dear.<eos> Granny.<eos> Now, Granny, there's something I'd love to show you.<eos> Hello, Lord Gillingham.<eos> It's very nice of you to come for this.<eos> Well, I came to see Mary, really.<eos> Of course you did.
Pretty scary, huh?<eos> Well, dreams are just your subconscious trying to make sense out of what happens to you during the day.<eos> What's a subconscious?<eos> The secret part of you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's the part of you that's here with me right now.<eos> And there's another part of you that just belongs to you.<eos> I don't think I have that part.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Everybody does.
- You're playing with fire, Sam.<eos> What do you think I did?<eos> Harmon Kryger broke in an hour ago.<eos> He stole confidential information.<eos> I told you he was alive, that he reached out to Molly.<eos> That is it. That is all I know.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time. What did Molly tell you this morning?<eos> You think she knew about this?<eos> Oh, I think it's possible you did too.<eos> - No. No, I didn't.
This girl's a great catch, why don't we try this settling down thing?<eos> You know, he's really smart, fun.<eos> I think he's brilliant.<eos> Natascha's a very loving individual.<eos> The love he was feeling from her is something that just probably filled a big void in him, too.<eos> And then with the birth of Monet, it was just mind-boggling for him to have that experience.<eos> He was present at the birth.<eos> And that feeling of being a father and just the incredible miracle of creation.<eos> Our lives changed dramatically after Monet and Chloe.<eos> He did a 180.
I could use some help getting the store ready to sell.<eos> Of course.<eos> Ready when you are, Captain. Good.<eos> Then we won't waste time on pleasantries.<eos> I'm sure the name Fu'ad Hansur means something to you. Yes.<eos> Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
What did you say to me after Jackie died?<eos> What did you tell me to do?<eos> I was out for two months.<eos> That was different.<eos> It's been half a day, Gibbs.<eos> He was your father.<eos> He was.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> And I still have a job to do.<eos> And I didn't?
This sword... Will not be sheathed Till it has taken a life.<eos> As the sun rises, this sword will cast a shadow.<eos> When that shadow touches the guilty... I'll know.<eos> Not now.<eos> Give them time to tell their sins And due penance.<eos> Let their souls be wiped clean;<eos> God likes that best.<eos> Everyone wants to confess.<eos> Who here... Made their confession yesterday?<eos> I did.
You've pitted yourself against them from the start.<eos> How can you retreat from that position?<eos> You mean I've made it 'them or me'?<eos> Haven't you?<eos> You despise the family, but I think you forget my wife was one of them.<eos> My child IS one of them.<eos> Where does that leave me?<eos> Don't you despise them?<eos> Really?<eos> No, I don't.
Why did Mr Carson try to hide that you were in London on that day?<eos> I don't think he tried to hide anything.<eos> He just forgot.<eos> Isn't it a big thing when a member of the staff goes to London?<eos> Not for a lady's maid.<eos> Mrs Hughes, please.<eos> She's right. It's not a big thing for ladies' maids or valets.<eos> I'm going tomorrow with Lady Mary.<eos> And you liked Mr Green?<eos> Yes. I did.
I hope that's true.<eos> We'll sit by the fire, with all our children around us, and I'll make certain that you are safe.<eos> I wonder.<eos> We both want it so much, but do you believe it'll really happen?<eos> I do. With all my heart.<eos> Actually, I'm not sure about having children 'all around us'.<eos> How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?<eos> You nearly missed me.<eos> You never told me you were going.<eos> Who did?
I like the librarian.<eos> He's weird, but he's interesting.<eos> I'll tell him that when i kill him.<eos> Do you mind if i cut in?<eos> You brought a crowbar to a sword fight.<eos> I was trained by excalibur.<eos> I think i'm gonna be okay.<eos> We do not want to be here.<eos> Time to go!<eos> Stone, how we doing?
Do you remember where you two were the night Kevin Neyers was killed?<eos> Goodness.<eos> When was that, again?<eos> We were right here.<eos> Eight months ago.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Look at me.<eos> What are you getting at, anyway?<eos> Do you own a gun, Mr. Harbach?<eos> No, I don't.
Get off my property.<eos> James Harbach is dead.<eos> Shot himself in the head.<eos> What?<eos> And he left a suicide note saying he killed Kevin Neyers.<eos> Don't pretend like you don't know.<eos> You had your grandfather kill your father.<eos> I know.<eos> Haven't put all the pieces together yet, and I will.<eos> But when I do...
Did mom have a man?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I went to a fortuneteller yesterday, and he said mom had a man.<eos> By her side, even now.<eos> What?<eos> It's weird, he got everything else right.<eos> About his failed flower shop, even your divorce.<eos> Maybe mom did have a lover.<eos> What?<eos> She did?
Stop!<eos> Fucking...<eos> What a fucking moron...<eos> I just want to talk...<eos> I really don't know!<eos> All I want to know is... the reason why Park's looking for Lee.<eos> I don't know, I swear!<eos> Please let me go, okay?<eos> You really don't?<eos> I don't!
With that girl. How do you mean?<eos> Well, they took george in.<eos> Never even gave me a call.<eos> Supposed to give parents a call, take a child in.<eos> I woke up about 4:00 a.M., and he wasn't home.<eos> Sun come up, went looking for him.<eos> Ended up down at the station.<eos> I was there on that bench all morning Waiting to see george.<eos> Did you see senator foulkes there?<eos> Of course I did.
- Exactly.<eos> - Parsonage.<eos> I've got a good feeling about this lottery.<eos> Yeah, you sure you don't want us to pick you up a ticket?<eos> Do all boys lie?<eos> I thought these two were different.<eos> - That's quite a tale.<eos> - A tall one at that.<eos> And this relates to the Marie Godfrey case in what way?<eos> - It doesn't.
He's, like, threatened by progress all of a sudden. You know what I mean?<eos> - And he lets his personal feelings cloud his professional judgment, which drives me insane.<eos> Sorry, we don't have to talk about my dumb office drama.<eos> Oh, no, it's okay.<eos> No. I like it.<eos> I'd like to talk more about it, actually.<eos> Really?<eos> Sure. I mean, take Ethan.<eos> How do you guys...? How do you guys control him?<eos> We don't.
Security breach. Code black.<eos> Fifth floor. Repeat.<eos> Security breach.<eos> Code black. Fifth floor.<eos> No!<eos> You've made a mistake.<eos> - I can help you. - Yeah?<eos> And how are you gonna help me?<eos> You don't know what you've unleashed.<eos> I do.
What the hell is going on?<eos> You have to discuss that with mom.<eos> I would love to, but she won't return any of my calls. We know that you lied about where you and Melissa were the night that Mrs. Dilaurentis died.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> What are you gonna do when the cops find out that the pills that killed her are in your medicine cabinet?<eos> You think I did it?<eos> I know that you were just trying to protect me.<eos> Damn right, I've been trying to protect you. But I would never take a life to cover up something you did.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Neither did I.
Is that dad?<eos> It was.<eos> Are we moving back home?<eos> Yes.<eos> But your father's moving out.<eos> We decided it was the best thing for everyone.<eos> You both decided this?<eos> I don't understand though.<eos> I thought you said that everything went well, that you believed him that he was telling the truth.<eos> I do.
- That's a great question.<eos> I know our entire department is looking for him.<eos> We have gotten assistance from the FBI.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> I like to think that he is somewhere... planning his comeback.<eos> We talked, we talked few months back.<eos> He missed me.<eos> He said he's coming for a visit, he'll come.<eos> He's coming.<eos> He always does.
Big school like that, students and teachers - are still roaming the hallways, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> We have security video.<eos> Whoever walked into Doc's office at that time is probably our killer.<eos> Hey, guys, we got a closed door mystery.<eos> The hall camera recorded back to two hours before the murder.<eos> No one walked into Doc Reid's room.<eos> - You got any good news?<eos> - I do, but there's some more bad.<eos> Which do you want first?<eos> Never do the good first, please.
Well, at least I've still got you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I'm resigning... as of right now.<eos> What?<eos> Just came in to say goodbye.<eos> Why?<eos> Tell me why.<eos> I believed in you, Erich.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> I don't anymore.
Michael.<eos> I was just in the office and there's something going on.<eos> - What?<eos> - The computer.<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> Take the day off.<eos> That's right.<eos> So why were Lou and Cutler having a secret meeting in that air-conditioned lair?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - But I do.
You want to tell me what?<eos> I kissed Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> I just wanted to feel normal for a minute.<eos> - Melanie, you are normal.<eos> - I died. Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> That no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.
My mom drew a picture of us holding up the dome way back when.<eos> Now, Lyle thinks that if we're dead, the rapture comes.<eos> - So he wanted to kill you too?<eos> - Yeah. He knew I'd follow him.<eos> I'm pretty sure that bomb there was meant for me.<eos> We need to make sure Joe and Norrie are safe.<eos> - I'll do that.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I'll go with him.<eos> - Melanie, I don't...
No.<eos> Their time's up soon and she couldn't face another voyage.<eos> Where will they send him, do you think? After Bombay.<eos> How are your Russians getting on?<eos> Oh, it's so sad.<eos> They talk about the old days - dances at the Winter Palace, picnics on the banks of the Neva - but there are holes in their shoes, and they've got no money for food.<eos> This is where Tom says it serves them right.<eos> Well, I don't approve of how things were managed in Russia, but I'm still sorry for people who have to make a new life in a foreign land.<eos> Honestly, Papa, every time you challenge Tom, you sound much more unreasonable than he is.<eos> Do I?
And the Russians who were driven out have spread to the four corners of the earth.<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> An old friend of yours?<eos> No, she's the wife of an old friend.<eos> Oh, just see what you can do, Shrimpie.<eos> Aunt Violet - if I can still call you Aunt Violet - I ought to warn you about something.<eos> I can guess what it is.<eos> You won't approve.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- What's this?<eos> Miss Bunting is giving instruction to Mrs Patmore's undercook.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I heard about that.<eos> You sound as if you don't approve.<eos> I approve.<eos> As long as you're not making... her unsettled.<eos> You don't know her name, do you?<eos> Sarah, please.<eos> Of course he does.
That's how it works.<eos> Don't tell anyone else what you did.<eos> I'll keep your secret and we'll keep going.<eos> You know you messed up.<eos> You're trying, but, dude, you can't do something like that again.<eos> I won't.<eos> You're stuck with us.<eos> Just like we're stuck with you, no matter what.<eos> I don't know why I told you.<eos> I do.
It ain't happening' again.<eos> Have fun with Hoss over there. No.No, no, no. No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Please! Please! Please!<eos> I'm sorry, please!<eos> - Please!<eos> Please, please!<eos> - Daryl. Daryl.<eos> You almost died 'cause of him!<eos> But I didn't.
Or we will come back with that a warrant, we'll turn your shop inside-out.<eos> What else are we gonna find here?<eos> They're just down here.<eos> If you could step away from the counter, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Joey panicking]<eos> Bryce, listen, listen to me. You don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
What'd she say?<eos> [Takes a breath] She said, uh... Went upstairs to sleep.<eos> Left all three of her brothers downstairs, playing video games.<eos> "The Three Amigos."<eos> Three brothers...<eos> Three shots.<eos> One bullet.<eos> Two blanks.<eos> We pulled lots of guns from that pawn shop, didn't we?<eos> We did.
The word meteoric comes to mind.<eos> And now, Steven Spielberg brings us E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.<eos> Spielberg says, well, you know, my pictures, they open slow. And they build, and they hold, and da da da da da.<eos> And I just looked at him, and I didn't know anything.<eos> I said, not this one. It was E.T.. I said, it's going to open huge , and it's going to stay huge.<eos> OK, the movie comes out. It's a huge hit. And we want to do the cartridge of it.<eos> OK? You know, every time you try to take some kind of a property and move it into another medium for a pure profit motive, you get trouble.<eos> Specifically, with respect to games, you know, it's like, oh you know, like, let's go see if we can exploit this movie as a game. You know, maybe we could make extra money out of a profitable franchise.<eos> Now, there was a negotiation going on between the Atari people, and the people at Universal, about what we're going to pay. And Steve Ross, who was the CEO from Warner, got in, and for whatever the reasons, he agrees to a deal that is so off the chart nobody believes it.<eos> But he does it.
Where have they gone?<eos> - Vasudev died.<eos> - Yes, we know.<eos> - What about the rest of the family?<eos> -They've gone to their hometown.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Who all?<eos> -His wife, two kids, and a brother too.<eos> - The brother left as well?<eos> -Yes, he did.
It was stinking so much that no one was ready to touch it.<eos> What had happened?<eos> No one knew for sure...<eos> Some people said that he must have slipped in the gutter and died.<eos> Some said he died of an insect bite in the gutter.<eos> - What did his family say?<eos> -They also didn't know for sure.<eos> He died... And within two days his family left as well.<eos> Did they say when they'll be returning?<eos> No, they didn't.
Okay.<eos> Let me take a look at the numbers here.<eos> I kind of want to do this on my own, you know?<eos> I see here that your wife is on the deed, as well.<eos> That's right.<eos> And...<eos> Not a problem.<eos> She's all behind it.<eos> Don't expect me to thank you for doing your job.<eos> I don't.
That...<eos> That part's true.<eos> But the rest of it, I just... made up.<eos> Why would you make something like that up, son?<eos> I don't know.<eos> 'Cause I was drunk, I guess.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Now, if you'll all excuse me, I got to close the shop up.<eos> This ain't going away, Ted.<eos> The truth never does.
Yes, both, I guess.<eos> So if I believe there is no God, then there is no God.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause you're just lost, Daniel.<eos> Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
Such a price to pay, daniel.<eos> Not really.<eos> What is it, daniel?<eos> Before you leave...<eos> Before you decide what your life may be, I need to tell you something, tawney.<eos> It's about teddy.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He's been dealing with a lot lately --<eos> Things you don't know about.<eos> And -- and you do?
Yep.<eos> I like these.<eos> I think I might try to work out a deal with him.<eos> I've got some news.<eos> I really don't want to have to tell you this.<eos> He came by the house.<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy.<eos> He told you?<eos> He did.
She wasn't laughing anymore.<eos> I don't even know why I got upset.<eos> She was so...<eos> So sad.<eos> So I sat with her...<eos> Till the sun came up.<eos> Then the sheriff came, And you -- you were there in the room.<eos> And you asked me what happened.<eos> You said you didn't remember.<eos> Well, a-at first, I-I didn't, but...
Daniel.<eos> I-I just put my hands around her neck... Squeezed as hard as I could.<eos> Until what?<eos> Until she was gone.<eos> I killed her.<eos> And no one put words in your mouth.<eos> No one coerced your confession.<eos> Did they?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't.
As well as 20 karats of gold.<eos> You will be tested by the royal concubines.<eos> The most proficient in the art of arousal will earn the privilege of residing permanently here... in our Great Khan's Hall of Five Desires.<eos> By "permanently," I mean just that.<eos> If selected, you will remain in the Hall of Five Desires until released from royal service.<eos> If you are chosen to become a Royal Concubine... all needs will be met.<eos> Those not chosen will be delivered to the Ministry of Finance to be sold off to the Khan's court.<eos> Those unclaimed by the court will be sold to whorehouses in outer Cambulac.<eos> Perform as though your life depends upon it.<eos> It most likely does.
I held her on her third day.<eos> How did you come to know my sister?<eos> You whored together.<eos> Mei Lin was my friend.<eos> Chancellor.<eos> Do you enjoy your current station in life?<eos> As concubine?<eos> Yes... Chancellor.<eos> You may speak freely.<eos> I do, Chancellor.
Always the villain. (SCOFFS)<eos> Even when I'm not.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Well, you were dumb enough to travel through time, maybe you should have left things well enough alone.<eos> I am not going to apologize for saving someone's life.<eos> She was to die anyway.<eos> What did it matter?<eos> What mattered was she was a person.<eos> And whatever she did, she didn't deserve to die.<eos> Well, maybe she did.
I was once, long ago, quite different. But I changed.<eos> And I left my past in the past, where it belongs.<eos> As you have.<eos> So what went on between us...<eos> Was real.<eos> Yes.<eos> My feelings for you were... Are real.<eos> But Marian is my wife.<eos> I loved her, and I made a vow, until death do us part.<eos> And it did.
Some kind of snow monster.<eos> We'll give you our assistance... (GROWLING IN DISTANCE)<eos> It's getting closer.<eos> It's coming from the north.<eos> There.<eos> No, no, no, don't shoot.<eos> It only attacks when it feels threatened.<eos> Pistol, sword, hook, my cutting wit.<eos> I don't think we have what it takes.<eos> Emma does.
I know how you feel about the Graysons, how you've always felt.<eos> And now I know now what they did to you and your company.<eos> I wish could have been there for you, Nolan, the way you've always been there for me.<eos> Which is why, if you can, I would... I would like it if you came to the interview tonight.<eos> I need someone on my side in case I get cornered.<eos> Then I'll be there.<eos> I'm proud of you, Nolan.<eos> All your hard work... It's paid off in spades.<eos> I wouldn't have any of this if you hadn't believed in me way back when.<eos> But I did.
I know I do.<eos> All right, well, it's public knowledge that Mr. Clarke and entrepreneur Nolan Ross were business associates years ago.<eos> Mr. Ross, welcome.<eos> Uh, Nolan was like the son I never had.<eos> And I knew his first company would be a success, and it was.<eos> Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.<eos> An investment that paid off.<eos> I figured the profits would provide a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.<eos> She never got the money, did she, Nolan?<eos> Of course she did.

- I don't think we can. - Why?<eos> Not after what I discovered.<eos> The guy that Charlotte killed had this.<eos> I convinced her that he was just another Flight 197 fanatic.<eos> Yeah, but if he had been, he would have published this photo so the world could see that known-terrorist David Clarke was still alive.<eos> - Who was this guy? - I don't know.<eos> But he was obviously following him for quite some time. But why?<eos> What is the connection?<eos> Your field trip didn't provide any answers?<eos> Sure did.
Someone needs to establish a permanent unit during peace time.<eos> To keep dangerous technology contained.<eos> And watch over people like Stark, who are toying with it.<eos> Until then, all we can do is box it up, lock it up and dedicate ourselves to making sure it never sees the light of day.<eos> We've got ears on them.<eos> The package is in the open.<eos> Don't engage until the deal's done.<eos> Copy that.<eos> - Trip, we got eyes?<eos> - Now we do.
Yeah, then you could learn to do something that's actually hard.<eos> Well, I actually do really hard things in peds.<eos> Really? Uh, like the teens in the parking lot.<eos> How are they?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Oh, they're morons.<eos> When do you leave for D.C., anyway?<eos> I was gonna ask Meredith if I could store some things in your side of the closet.<eos> Did Meredith tell you that?<eos> You both did, loudly, until about 4:00 in the morning.
I'll stay with him.<eos> Come on with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to go with my mom.<eos> I haven't seen a spaceship with a trap door before.<eos> Want to show me how to use it?<eos> My dad's dead, isn't he?<eos> Well, we should talk about that when your mom's back.<eos> Dead means he's gone away, doesn't it, and he's never coming back?<eos> It does.
If there are 48 of us here, we still have people out there.<eos> The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.
Unauthorized access.<eos> Clarke, no!<eos> If you pull that lever, these people will die.<eos> Even a little radiation can kill them.<eos> Unauthorized access.<eos> Don't make me shoot you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Clarke.<eos> Don't do this.
- You've helped me enough, Matt.<eos> Not you. Them.<eos> The Remnant.<eos> You can't help them.<eos> Yes, I can. I know I can because I'm supposed to. But you need to tell me why she did what she did.<eos> You need to tell me what she said.<eos> She said, "I understand."<eos> - Understood what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
Nothing!<eos> N... no, Jack!<eos> Jack, listen!<eos> Listen!<eos> Nothing, Jack!<eos> N... no, l-listen to me!<eos> I'm not a part of them, Jack!<eos> I'm not a part of them!<eos> She worked for you. No, no!<eos> No, she didn't, she didn't!
I am.<eos> She'll know that I did.<eos> But the only way we beat them is from the other side.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> A good man is hard to find.<eos> He was taken from me much too young.<eos> It's a symbol of a person I was and can be again.<eos> You and me have something in common.<eos> We do, huh?
What are you doing?<eos> I know, goddamn it.<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> You hungry?<eos> What the hell happened to my cabinetry?<eos> Deer broke in.<eos> Huh! No shit.<eos> Try not to get trapped in there.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Uh... I didn't.
What to fucking do?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> You ever think about the 14th, 14th of October?<eos> The great vanishing?<eos> The sudden departure?<eos> The clusterfuck of the modern era?<eos> When's the last time you ever really thought about it?<eos> I don't.
Until we are a blank slate.<eos> We are living reminders of what you try So desperately<eos> And we are ready<eos> And we are waiting<eos> Because it's not gonna be long now.<eos> Now I know why you don't fuckin' talk.<eos> Got to hand it to you, patti. That is such an impressive line of fucking bullshit.<eos> Well, laurie obviously disagrees with you.<eos> Laurie didn't join you to become a living fucking reminder.<eos> Then why did she?
That hoverboards exist, or that it was Zelda in the dress?<eos> Both.<eos> Which one you want me to prove first?<eos> Hoverboards.<eos> Silver dress it is.<eos> I made you breakfast.<eos> This is Stephie, Zelda's friend from law school.<eos> She likes whatever her boyfriends like and giving relationship advice.<eos> I thought you really liked him.<eos> Yeah, I did.

You lie to me again, you no longer have an attorney.<eos> Frank, find out how the prosecution knew about Max's first trial.<eos> Whoever slipped the information could be a possible suspect.<eos> - And the rest of you, prove I wasn't wrong to hire you.<eos> I forgot. I'm sorry.<eos> My boss called us into work last minute, and I'll take you to dinner this weekend instead.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oliver?<eos> Boyfriend drama?<eos> I don't do boyfriends.
It's all right.<eos> Make any headway with your missing girl?<eos> Uh, I've canvassed Pacoima,<eos> Santa Clarita, San Fernando, and Mission Hills.<eos> I've hung posters in bus stops, truck stops, and a community-college ride-share program.<eos> I have dogs in the national forest and birds over Pico Canyon.<eos> So, if by "making headway" you mean I've eliminated pretty much anywhere that a malnourished, penniless, scared-as-hell, illegal immigrant could go without anybody noticing her, then, yeah, I've made tremendous headway.<eos> Well, you know, pretty girl, desperate, middle of the night,<eos> - think somebody picked her up?<eos> - No, I don't.
I don't know when, but we lost that.<eos> Well, you know, it doesn't have to stay that way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Charlie, baby, turn around.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Listen, um...<eos> I want you to know that if it... if it was gonna be anybody, it would be you.<eos> I really want to keep it.<eos> You want to help me cut the peppers?<eos> Yes, I do.
Can we go?<eos> Rude.<eos> Give it back.<eos> Can you not look at your phone while driving?<eos> You are way too obsessed with Jake. It's not healthy.<eos> Please tell me someone here has alcohol.<eos> If I have to share this gross oxygen pool with you losers, the least you could do is get me drunk so I don't remember it.<eos> I left my flask at home, but we can get drinks with our fakes at the show.<eos> No one here has a fake.<eos> I do.
Let's just go.<eos> You know what? I'd actually love to get a bottle of this rose that Luke turned me on to.<eos> Eva, would you be up for some classy PBR?<eos> - It's my favorite.<eos> - Ugh. Fine. Go.<eos> But I'm staying here. I would have to lather myself in Purell before stepping into that etch-a-sketch place.<eos> _<eos> Excuse me. - Do you have the time?<eos> - Ew! Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.
Clara, be my pal...and tell me... ..am I a good man?<eos> I...don't know.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.<eos> Right!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Into darkness.<eos> Doc...tor!<eos> How do you know who I am?<eos> He doesn't.
Use any color that expresses how the flower makes you feel.<eos> No, Donna, don't do that.<eos> There are no mistakes, guys.<eos> Great paintings often come out of mistakes.<eos> Aria, would you mind spreading out the other prints on the table?<eos> Thief.<eos> Thief.<eos> Rhonda. It's one thing to not participate, it's another to disrupt.<eos> She stole my drawing!<eos> No, she didn't.
If I sign a contract for five years, that'll be the rest of my life.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You're not just pathetic, you're selfish.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Roger.<eos> You may have the votes, but you don't have a deal.<eos> Now can we dispense with this nonsense, go outside and say a fond farewell?<eos> Ted... what if I told you you could just write copy and fight clients and not worry about partnership votes or stock prices?<eos> You could just go back to creative.<eos> I have that right now, and I'm miserable.<eos> No, you don't.
I gave public lectures, taught classes, and addressed clubs, colleges, churches and groups of every denomination.<eos> CHIDANANDA: But it took Yogananda a few years to realize that he wasn't in the right place for this message to really take off.<eos> SONI: In 1925, Yogananda arrives in Los Angeles, and on the first night, according to the LA Times, over 6,000 people attend his talk.<eos> That's double the capacity of the auditorium.<eos> Los Angeles is this new frontier.<eos> It's a place of possibility, of a new beginning.<eos> Ideas of Asian spirituality have permeated the West Coast in a way that they haven't on the East Coast.<eos> People come to Los Angeles often looking for something.<eos> So there's this already mind of a seeker.<eos> Yogananda does a seven-night speaker series at the LA Philharmonic Auditorium.
I can't name my source.<eos> That's a fucking lie.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard. She never did.<eos> No, missy, she's dead.<eos> Asking if you were all in, that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.
I mean, she must have been cracking up, right?<eos> That's why she was all paranoid about Richard and Silvie.<eos> So you don't think that they were having an affair?<eos> Hell no.<eos> And I told Elena that, but she wouldn't believe me.<eos> She took off upset.<eos> About what time was that?<eos> I don't know. Around 9:00.<eos> The next day, she begged me not to say anything...<eos> So I never did.
[Sniffles] First thing I had to do was order the parts for the liquid-nitrogen device.<eos> And make it look like Carter Humphries did.<eos> The P.O. box was Dr. Jennings' idea...<eos> A final "screw you" for sleeping with his wife.<eos> The parts came, he built the device, and we planted it in the vents.<eos> Jennings took that test every morning when you went out for scones.<eos> That way, if you had a change of heart while it was happening, you couldn't stop it.<eos> [Voice breaking]: Every day got a little more stressful, especially when his symptoms started to show.<eos> We... we both knew it was coming.<eos> And then... it did.
We got nothing.<eos> They literally burned everything.<eos> - And we have pictures of burning drugs and buses.<eos> We can sell this as a major takedown, our major takedown.<eos> - So we just keep smiling and climbing, huh?<eos> - Come back to D.C. with me.<eos> We can take a victory lap.<eos> Somebody in law enforcement tipped off solano.<eos> - Okay, you don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Here... Wrap this around his face.<eos> Hold it tight at the back of his head.<eos> - Oh, please don't do this.<eos> No!<eos> No, no.<eos> - How long do you want to do this, huh, Lawrence?<eos> - Again.<eos> - Briggs.<eos> - No! - He knows.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
- Your workups are in the living room, all of them.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Good-bye, agent Warren.<eos> - Bye, Jess.<eos> - Back to D.C., huh?<eos> - Talk to Jessica?<eos> - No, I just heard they were gonna throw you, like, a ticker tape parade.<eos> I figured you couldn't resist.<eos> - Yeah, but we didn't accomplish anything.<eos> - Oh, yes, the hell we did.
Yeah, yeah, it's good.<eos> Just check the perimeter.<eos> Just give us a moment.<eos> Here, here, here.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I was reading some new studies where they're using corticosteroids to... reduce inflammation in myocarditis.<eos> I mean, it's not a cure-all, but it sounded promising.<eos> You've been researching my heart condition?<eos> Well, after Venezuela, I did some reading up, yeah.
Where is she?<eos> Where is this witch who dares craft moonlight rings Without my permission?<eos> Niklaus...<eos> I've been expecting you.<eos> I must offer my condolences On the tragic loss of your child.<eos> Wasn't it your coven who threatened her life?<eos> Is that tea your idea of a peace offering?<eos> Chamomile has lots of healing properties.<eos> Did you know that it's also a flowering plant?<eos> I did.
Wow!<eos> Hercules!<eos> What do you desire, Gauls?<eos> Have the dignity...<eos> Your inflated dignity talk, Julius!<eos> What?<eos> The Mansion of the Gods is deceitful, treacherous and calculated!<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> We try things. Sometimes it works, sometimes....<eos> It did not.
Nice job.<eos> Come on.<eos> You have lost your mind, Abbott.<eos> Your people hounded my client, abused her when they took her into custody.<eos> Now you want her to cooperate?<eos> There was no abuse, Ellen.<eos> I got bruises.<eos> You ran, Tish.<eos> When people do that, we chase after them.<eos> Of course she did.
Anyway...<eos> It's good to see you, Teresa.<eos> You too, Marcus.<eos> Jane.<eos> That was weird.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Uh, he asked me if I had a plan for you.<eos> Plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... I don't.
Who?<eos> A group who can be trusted.<eos> Join me.<eos> There's a future with me.<eos> With Fausto, none.<eos> The Marines will be coming for him.<eos> What are you asking me?<eos> I will pay you.<eos> You don't have what I want.<eos> Fausto does.
I don't feel like another interrogation.<eos> What you need is a partner... a seasoned investigator, like me.<eos> You're my hallucination.<eos> You're no more seasoned than I am.<eos> Really?<eos> I would've squeezed that guy.<eos> Why didn't you make him sweat a little?<eos> Because he would have tossed me out of his office.<eos> - It's not like I have a badge.<eos> - But I do.
Where you going?<eos> Where you puttin' the hole?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You can't change a hole right in the middle of your playing, can he?<eos> Well he just did.<eos> Stand there and watch him.<eos> Alrighty, got you a brand-new one right here, fellas.<eos> Well, we already hit though.<eos> You guys don't play by the rules?<eos> No, we do.
"Could I have you just, like,<eos> "go up and act like you weren't hired by me<eos> "to go just talk with him,<eos> "and just sit and talk with him for, like, an hour or something?"<eos> Well, hello, good-looking.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - I'm doing good.<eos> Good.<eos> I lucked out getting the only dry bench in the park, it seems.<eos> Right, you did, you really did.
I fucking hate you.<eos> This is Handsome Jack Heartthrob, he's gonna be our corpse for the day.<eos> This is our hearse, and we're gonna ride around and...<eos> - Car.<eos> - Car.<eos> This is the second funeral bit you've done with us.<eos> On the TV show, he...<eos> On the TV show, Jack was playing her pad and falling out of the back of the hearse.<eos> Wait, wait, how do we know this thing's not gonna flip over, though?<eos> - We don't.
He showed up and he was just angry.<eos> You know, he just sat down angry.<eos> Of course, he was angry.<eos> I gotta go to the restroom.<eos> I gotta use the restroom. - No.<eos> Irving.<eos> - Yeah, you know what, I'm, let's, let...<eos> I said I had to go to the restroom.<eos> Jesus. Well, you didn't have to go and...<eos> I did.
Arnold left me buckets of that.<eos> Everything else I've had to sell.<eos> I know what it is to struggle and I'm sorry for...<eos> I want the money that was in that account.<eos> My lawyer says it's open and shut.<eos> He's looked into it very thoroughly, found out all sorts of things.<eos> Conors Gould is close to bankrupt.<eos> Then I'll sue you personally.<eos> I've nothing like that amount.<eos> Your husband does.
People trampled each other to grab it.<eos> Just the sort of thing that amused him.<eos> New Year's Eve, 1923.<eos> The home of Mr. and Mrs. Nucky Thompson.<eos> Tell me again there's no money.<eos> Carolyn, please.<eos> You're hurt and angry.<eos> I understand more than you realize.<eos> But you and I have a great deal in common.<eos> No, we don't, sweetie.
Did work there for the summer.<eos> - This town gels awful dull come September.<eos> -Don't start that. "Much I have traveled in realms of gold And many goodly states and kingdoms..."<eos> Learn another poem.<eos> -"Stout Cortez..."<eos> -I am not.<eos> -"...with eagle eyes..."<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Ned, Ruth' you'll love one another.<eos> Oh, we do, Mother.
-Don't sell yourself short.<eos> If you could put one over on Arnold, you can do this.<eos> You're up to something.<eos> I'm helping my wife.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> I should get to the train.<eos> It's late.<eos> Leave in the morning.<eos> I don't have anywhere to stay.<eos> Do I?
The sickness was someplace else.<eos> They've given me a first grade class.<eos> It's just what I've asked for.<eos> They can be an unruly lot.<eos> No, they're the perfect age.<eos> Just hungry to learn everything.<eos> And free from old prejudice.<eos> What is lacking among the schoolchildren in Camden?<eos> You said you wished for me to choose my own path.<eos> Did I?
But I'm seeing clearly now.<eos> Thinking clearly.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> I'm sure there are formalities to observe, but I'd like to start the process.<eos> Which process is that?<eos> The process of being released.<eos> Why were you brought to us?<eos> I took someone's life... in a state of temporary insanity out of grief.<eos> You know you were ill?<eos> I do.
You think this is a joke? No.<eos> Not with all the penalties and interest.<eos> He has to report the money, legal or not, otherwise...<eos> Five years in a federal penitentiary, minimum.<eos> If we can prove the income.<eos> Key to the count room.<eos> Combination to the safe.<eos> - We need the ledger books.<eos> - You're gonna get them for us.<eos> Why don't you do it yourself?
- That's my son!<eos> - Got in the car and took off.<eos> "One never knows the capacity of an ordinary hand satchel until dire necessity compels the exercise of all one's ingenuity to reduce everything to the smallest possible compass.<eos> In mine, I was able to pack two travelling caps, three veils, a pair of slippers, a complete outfit of toilet articles, inkstand, pens, pencils, and copy paper, needles and thread, a dressing gown..."<eos> Yes, a hand satchel.<eos> Don't take me back.<eos> Who's going to look after you?<eos> I'll look after myself.<eos> You can't live out of a satchel.<eos> - Nellie did.
- 24 hours rr.<eos> - Oh, sh--. Street crime taking a day off too?<eos> - Yeah, let's hope so. - [Chuckles]<eos> - Listen, me and the gang, we're gonna take a little road trip tomorrow.<eos> I was hoping you'd come along.<eos> - Hmm, road trip where?<eos> - Heading down South to tecate.<eos> - Tecate?<eos> Thought your contract with Carlos solano expired.<eos> - Yeah, it did.
- Don't touch it.<eos> Don't dislodge the tubes.<eos> Rick, listen to me.<eos> Look at me. Look at me.<eos> You gotta rest. Okay?<eos> You gotta sit back, and you gotta trust me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got our best guy on this, and he is gonna take care of you.<eos> But now you need your rest... and I promise that I'm watching out for you.<eos> You always do.
Well, I didn't need your help, all right?<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Roommate troubles?<eos> It's like we're doing the cha-cha --<eos> I take one step forward, she takes one step back.<eos> Does she have any friends?<eos> She likes picking fights a little bit too much -- a loner.<eos> Oh, well, she needs a friend.<eos> We all do.
Jane.<eos> Yes?<eos> Just talked to Abbott.<eos> The CIA got in touch with him about one of the names that Cole gave up -- some smuggler.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> That's progress.<eos> Well, the Agency squeezed Cole for everything they could get -- associates, habits, personal life.<eos> Mm. Well, what does that got to do with us?<eos> Turns out we know the smuggler's girlfriend -- well, you do.<eos> I do?
Tell Vega to stay close and give you the help you need.<eos> Got it.<eos> And what if they can't crack it?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> This guy, John Paul, does he have any idea when Jane's supposed to arrive in the U.S.? No.<eos> And Nemec won't risk getting in touch with him.<eos> Jane said he was only given a window of arrival, not a specific date.<eos> So, as far as he knows, Jane's already here.<eos> Does he know what Jane looks like?<eos> No. He doesn't.
Don't worry about it.<eos> You mean it?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> Thank you. You're the best.<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir. Agent Wylie doesn't need my help.<eos> Okay if I come along with you?<eos> You run it by Abbott?<eos> Did he okay it?<eos> Yes, sir, he did.
It's the end of Ramadan.<eos> They're celebrating.<eos> Fireworks.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Yeah. It is beautiful.<eos> You thought it was a bomb, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I did not.<eos> You did.
What?<eos> I lied... To Anatoly Simonov, Nightfall.<eos> I don't remember him from the park when I was a kid.<eos> What do you mean, Charlie?<eos> I told him my father said he was a hero, that I remember them walking away that day.<eos> It's not true, Mo.<eos> I have no memory of that moment at all.<eos> I lied.<eos> Well, he died a hero.<eos> No, he didn't.
So, Henry Morgan, what's your story?<eos> Well, I won't bore you with the details, but the watch was a gift.<eos> Legend has it had belonged to a doctor seeking passage on a ship from Africa.<eos> It was given to him by his father.<eos> Anyway, the watch was lost at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> And years later, it was recovered by a team of treasure hunters.<eos> It was bought at auction and given to me.<eos> Wow. That is a generous gift.<eos> This person must have really cared about you.<eos> Yes, of course she did.
Yeah, she was beautiful.<eos> We all have different ways of dealing with loss.<eos> He never forgot her.<eos> What's this? "Youth.<eos> Vitality.<eos> Vigor."<eos> The ouroboros, or a snake eating its own tail.<eos> It suggests eternal renewal.<eos> I wonder if that has something to do with the condition of your father's body.<eos> Or maybe this does.
I'll put all of it in writing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're gonna break the mirror.<eos> You realize that?<eos> I apologize.<eos> Before you secure a confession,<eos> I need you to ask Anton something verbatim.<eos> "When you extracted the complex peptide "from the pituitary gland, did you use the Ribowsky method?"<eos> My colleague has a simple question... when you extracted the complex peptide from the pituitary glands, did you use the Ribowsky method?<eos> Of course I did.
Is it phenytoin?<eos> - Or some other anticonvulsant?<eos> - I don't have to answer that.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Dr. Morgan, this is not the time.<eos> Okay, H-Henry, let's go.<eos> This is important.<eos> The case depends on it.<eos> Do you take phenytoin?<eos> Yes, millions of people do.
What is it?<eos> This room is filled with Degas, Monet, all masterpieces.<eos> And one painting by an unknown Argentinean.<eos> Ah, the Vermeers.<eos> Abigail, this is Gloria.<eos> It's her party.<eos> I think you have someone special here, Abigail.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
What doesn't belong here?<eos> This.<eos> A painting by an unknown artist.<eos> In the 1950s, Fernando Costa was a young painter on the rise...<eos> Promising, but hardly worthy of this museum.<eos> Only one person could make this happen.<eos> Gloria Carlyle.<eos> And she was in love with him.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes, I do.
Ah, but only to a point, though, right?<eos> Have you ever thought about what it would be like to work for somebody who gives you their unconditional support?<eos> If you're wondering, I am recruiting you to come and work for me.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> Soldiers, spies, poets, teachers.<eos> These are the most unappreciated professions that I know.<eos> Now, I can't fix the teachers and the poets, but people like you I can--<eos> I can show you that you're appreciated.<eos> You don't understand me at all.<eos> Oh, of course I do.
Let's talk about something you do know-- the CIA charter.<eos> You know that operating on U.S. soil is a direct violation of it.<eos> With all due respect, as I said a moment ago, I am not aware of any CIA operation that violates it.<eos> Though the CIA may think otherwise, Mr. Michaels, it is accountable for what happened, and I demand answers.<eos> Are we keeping you from something?<eos> Actually, you are.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Events are still unfolding in this situation, and I would be much better able to better answer your questions if we adjourn until tomorrow, and I could get back to Langley and dig in.<eos> Surely, you have people back at Langley dealing with things.<eos> Yes, I do, but--
How can I trust you?<eos> Because I work for the state of chihuahua. Not for those assholes.<eos> I'm your friend, sonya.<eos> Don't you see what's happening?<eos> That war is finally here, in the u.S.,<eos> And the border won't be able to stop it.<eos> We need to get everyone responsible--<eos> Fausto, sebastian, eleanor.<eos> Yes...<eos> We do.
- But it doesn't change the fact that my sister's drawings have always been right.<eos> We won't have to go far.<eos> An image search found possibilities in town.<eos> I've got all the red doors here in Zenith.<eos> Personally, I'm thinking the storage space, but if we're really digging into the space-time of it all, the colonial's got that whole Narnia spin.<eos> You said that you saw this in a vision?<eos> They always mean something.<eos> I think that door is the way back into the dome.<eos> Hunter, we need addresses.<eos> No, you don't.
Tell me what you mean.<eos> You guys okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's Lyle?<eos> He was ahead of me.<eos> Oh, my God, what if he didn't make it?<eos> Come on.<eos> Like, coming through... did any of you guys see stuff?<eos> - I couldn't see crap.<eos> - I did. Like a memory.
Which is all perfectly legal.<eos> I need to call my broker.<eos> It's complimentary.<eos> Mabel?<eos> I should have picked that up.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was at the school. I was unwell, so I came home.<eos> And it happened here.<eos> - What did?
Inside that vault is a digital file named "Exodus."<eos> What's in the file?<eos> It's not our concern, but we got to make a copy of that file without anybody knowing.<eos> Yeah. I can take this. I'll call you when I'm done.<eos> Come on, huh?<eos> Doesn't the idea of working together give you a little tingle?<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> That's too bad 'cause it's Woodford's orders, so if you want this freedom thing, you're stuck with me.<eos> Do you have a way in?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I mean, apparently you are my boyfriend.<eos> Well, that's a first because I've never had a girlfriend whose name I didn't know.<eos> I'm Amy.<eos> Neal.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Neal.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> It's hard enough putting the bad guys in prison without the good guys letting them out.<eos> The same could be said for you, Agent Burke.<eos> I had the feeling I'd see you soon.<eos> Did you?
These right here, airlines and corresponding plane numbers.<eos> International airlines.<eos> So whatever they're transporting is going in and out of the country.<eos> We haven't figured out what these numbers mean yet, but we think it has something to do with where the shipment ends up.<eos> If everything is chosen at random...<eos> No one knows who's flying or where until the algorithm chooses.<eos> Cloaked in this kind of secrecy, it must be a very high value target.<eos> And without planning, it's almost an impossible heist.<eos> Unless you have the algorithm.<eos> Of which, thanks to Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.
I have to use the bathroom.<eos> I'm not authorized to let anyone through.<eos> I feel like a caged animal.<eos> That is still such a rush.<eos> I'd ask you to come with me, but...<eos> But you won't ask a question you don't know the answer to.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Eva?<eos> I don't know. She got away.<eos> The good ones always do.
First, we have a problem to solve.<eos> Didn't I already solve it?<eos> We already know how long it's going to take Braxnet Security to respond to the alarm.<eos> I've calculated how many men we need to load the money into the tubes in that amount of time.<eos> 'Cause now we're a man short.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, on the other hand, it's one less share to load.<eos> I don't leave money on the table.<eos> I assume you have a solution.<eos> I do.
They carry the cash so we won't have to.<eos> We walk right out and straight to where the money is waiting for us, here.<eos> This is all going down now!<eos> You said you had a bigger plan. Where the hell do I fit in?<eos> Let me make this clear.<eos> I am not going to raise our child as a married single mother.<eos> And he's gonna be the first priority in this family.<eos> We have a problem to solve.<eos> Because now, we're a man short. I assume you have a solution.<eos> I do.
- Keller! Come here.<eos> Come here. Relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> - No, no, no! - Relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> Don't come any closer, Burke. Don't do it.<eos> You let her go, Keller!<eos> I'm tired of taking orders from you, so right now we're gonna do this my way.<eos> So do as I say, and she lives.<eos> We all do.
Are you an attorney or an investment banker?<eos> I'm an investment banker.<eos> Then what the hell are you doing in my chambers?<eos> Acting as my own attorney.<eos> And no matter how much he tries to confuse the issue, he can't.<eos> I told him I was going after the same company he was and he used that knowledge to move up his tender offer.<eos> He waived conflict.<eos> That doesn't apply to privilege.<eos> Bottom line is, he doesn't have proof of anything.<eos> I don't, but he does.
No, simply because I'm gonna tell everyone here in the office that you said you eat cock for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> It's goddamn delicious.<eos> So what, you think you can handle Todd Smith better than me?<eos> Well, let's just see.<eos> Let's just see what you got.<eos> Saw you scheduled a meeting with Mike.<eos> I assume that means you're going to offer him a deal.<eos> It could mean I'm going to offer him a trip to Disneyland.<eos> But it doesn't.
Rachel...<eos> Just tell me this. Did you refuse the deal because it wasn't good enough or because it came from Logan?<eos> You think I didn't take this deal because of your history with this asshole?<eos> Well, you did just call him an asshole.<eos> He's an asshole because he's willing to decimate a company just to put some money in his pocket.<eos> Look, I gave my word to Walter Gillis.<eos> That's what I told Harvey and what I told Logan and what I didn't think I'd have to tell you.<eos> I'm just saying, all of this could have been over today.<eos> You think I don't want this to be over?<eos> I do.
Which very much sounds as though... it's up to us.<eos> Neither of you are going anywhere.<eos> I've lost my crew.<eos> We were the last astronauts, this is the last shuttle, these are the last nuclear bombs.<eos> We're the last chance for Earth, and you're staying to help me.<eos> Decision made.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is killing the moon?<eos> How can the moon die, though?<eos> Everything does. Sooner or later.
Brother what have I become?<eos> You seem like the wolves at the village.<eos> Cursed to turn when the moon is full.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Father's beside himself with rage.<eos> It seems this affliction it can only be passed by a certain kind of conception.<eos> And do our siblings share this affliction?<eos> Do you share this affliction?<eos> No.<eos> I do not.
Well, now that esther knows where she's hiding,<eos> Not long. The only way to stop it is to stop her. Then let's do this.<eos> Marcel's a vampire,<eos> You both are powerful witches.<eos> Esther's stronger than anything i've ever seen.<eos> We go up against her, We're gonna need klaus.<eos> We can do this without him.<eos> I'm never gonna say this again, But marcel's right.<eos> [chanting] [gasps] [groans]<eos> What did you do to me?
Carrie...<eos> I'm not introducing you to my moms... until I know this is definitely something real.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't realize that you were fucking... a pretend vagina every night.<eos> They're my moms.<eos> - lt's a big step.<eos> - I'm ready for that.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> Uh, do they even know I exist?<eos> Yeah, of course they do.
With all the shame that goes with it?<eos> And the pay cut back to entry level?<eos> Fuck.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I can't do any of that.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> Go back in time.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> - You should've come to me.<eos> - I did.
Tony Bravo.<eos> Reyna Flores.<eos> You got a few minutes?<eos> For an interview.<eos> How do you feel about what happened in Nicaragua?<eos> Because if you can handle these foreys into the unknown, maybe I can use you.<eos> So I looked into that artifact Galan was bidding on a month ago, and it came from somewhere in eastern Nicaragua.<eos> and this one overlaps with Galan's new coca field.<eos> Did you get what you wanted out of the trip, Mr. Galan?<eos> Yes, I did.
It's a straight shot to big bear.<eos> There's a cabin there in her ex-husband's name. Let's go.<eos> Tony, I got to go.<eos> - Tell me where the cabin is.<eos> - We got this.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna sit here while Galan cuts down every history buff in the phone book.<eos> Look, I know how hard it is when you aren't doing everything you think you can do. Believe me, but you need to stay put, play your role, and maintain your cover.<eos> That's your priority, especially with Reyna Flores all over you.<eos> Yeah, well, I thought you guys were gonna handle her.<eos> We did.
What?<eos> Let's see, last year, You gave me a rabbit.<eos> The year before you gave me a live grenade. So...<eos> The jerk thing didn't end.<eos> I'm about to give you The story of a lifetime, my friend.<eos> What are you into?<eos> You've been following the hani jibril case?<eos> I have.<eos> It's hard to believe that She'd kill anyone, let alone a prince.<eos> She didn't.
Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.<eos> And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.<eos> You've done your research.<eos> I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.<eos> So you're a dancer?<eos> Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites.<eos> You'll find people here have many skills and interests.<eos> Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?<eos> What?<eos> I-I didn't.
We take care of our wards... and they revere the Khan as their father.<eos> Today, they honor us by working tirelessly to prepare for the White Moon festivities.<eos> Something wrong, Blue Princess?<eos> I was merely observing the peasants' devotion, their love for their royal benefactress.<eos> Do you question their devotion and their love?<eos> I do not.<eos> Stop.<eos> Does Lady Kokachin wish to speak on the topic of the common people?<eos> I apologize, Empress, for speaking when not bid to do so.<eos> Do so... now.
The cripple, Yusuf, is beyond reproach.<eos> Yusuf hides behind his words.<eos> Is that what you'll report?<eos> Untrue by an inch... untrue by a mile.<eos> I have no story to tell, Sire.<eos> I believe my friend, Sanga, traveled to Kochkor... but I do not know on whose command... if anyone's.<eos> What are your suspicions?<eos> I must say nothing... for fear that I may condemn an innocent.<eos> All I know... is someone seeks your head.<eos> Many do, Latin.
She was held in a basement, okay?<eos> Alison was kidnapped and blindfolded and I don't even want to think about what else.<eos> Hasn't the universe punished her enough?<eos> What we're doing isn't punishment, it's a preventative measure.<eos> That's semantics.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but I feel bad for her.<eos> It's hard to still see Ali as the devil when she just escaped from the hell.<eos> What if I told you that her abduction story is just that, a story?<eos> No one would lie about something like that.<eos> She did.
I don't see any together in this.<eos> Auggie.<eos> You mind telling me which side the graffiti's on?<eos> I hate standing on the wrong side of the Cold War.<eos> I just heard. I'm sorry.<eos> They want you to be a good soldier until you die or are no longer of use to them, and then they put you behind a desk.<eos> Come on in.<eos> The water's fine.<eos> - Doesn't it bother you?<eos> - It did. Sure.
I'm Walter Gillis' partner, and if he cuts off our funding at any point in the next two months following this lunch, then the next time you're talking about these brussels sprouts will be in front of a grand jury.<eos> Oh, Vernon, don't take it personally.<eos> He did the same thing to the guy from Leeds at the exact same table seven months ago.<eos> Louis, I got your memo, and if you want to get an antique diving bell for your new office, it's on your dime.<eos> Okay, that's bullshit, but whatever.<eos> I'm here about Jeff Malone.<eos> I am not the principal.<eos> You two are gonna have to work your shit out on the playground.<eos> But you see, that's just it.<eos> We already did.
Well, maybe you should think of something that won't ruin his goddamn life. Hey.<eos> You ready to get down to business?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> I was thinking that maybe we could do all this over lunch.<eos> It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
I have a file?<eos> That information is classified.<eos> - Wait, why?<eos> - It's in your file.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> If you'd be more comfortable, I have a couple rocks you could crawl out from under.<eos> Most people would go with some tall weeds I could hide behind.<eos> Most people don't take these fights personally.<eos> I do.
They don't need alternatives. They're pawns.<eos> Pawns need a King.<eos> They serve for my conquests. My victories.<eos> You think they're smart enough to follow you?<eos> They're mine. I can use them. Break them.<eos> You double crossing half breed traitor.<eos> James T. Kirk. You are hereby relieved of command.<eos> Let go of me.<eos> Do you realize what you're doing?<eos> I do.
When I was a teenager, I started reading every book I could find on the occult.<eos> I taught myself spells, rituals, curses.<eos> I learned to conjure all kinds of dead things.<eos> Just not her.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I told you to call my cell phone.<eos> You really don't want to be up here.<eos> Oh, yes, he does.
Something else, like what?<eos> Well, let's find out.<eos> Well, the node is easily enough removed.<eos> BRODY: That looks like ink.<eos> It is.<eos> Tattoo ink.<eos> Duringthetattooprocess, it'sdepositedin thedermis.<eos> Microphagesdigestit , andthenmigrate intotheclosestlymphnodes.<eos> But she doesn't have any tattoos.<eos> She doesn't now, but she did at some point.
I don't know, maybe big sister was, uh, helping him out financially.<eos> I-I don't know how.<eos> I... I mean, from what I've seen, it looks like her cancer pretty much obliterated her finances.<eos> She basically had nothing left.<eos> Except...<eos> Wow. This is weird.<eos> Uh... What?<eos> How do you think that happened?<eos> Hey, Russell, you got a sec?<eos> I do.
You don't have to say it twice.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> She's defending you. None of this is true.<eos> But it's good for you.<eos> You never had the phone, and now griffin has a motive.<eos> If he knew lila was cheating on him --<eos> He didn't. [ sighs ] you don't know that.<eos> I-I do.
Well, Dan got a job with the public defender's office.<eos> Tess got a boyfriend, so she stopped showing up.<eos> I have to hire people to replace them, but I don't have any time because my client and her four kids are going to be living on my couch if I don't win this case.<eos> Really?<eos> You wouldn't even give them your bed?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> What? You know who I could hire without having to give an interview?<eos> I thought you didn't hire first-years.<eos> We don't.
Oh, it seems idiotic to me.<eos> And me.<eos> What about if you want to start a family of your own?<eos> But I dote on her.<eos> If they send her to some horrid orphanage,<eos> I'd never forgive myself. But can't you just give them some money so they can keep her?<eos> I think Mrs Drewe finds it too much.<eos> It isn't only the money.<eos> - That seems a bit feeble.<eos> - Does it?
I can't talk about this tonight, nor for some time to come.<eos> And I think Rose and her young man will take up every scrap of attention we have for weddings.<eos> Please don't say that. Papa!<eos> Larry's been sitting in the car since he left the dining room.<eos> I'm just coming.<eos> I'll say goodnight to Mrs Crawley.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Don't blame Larry.<eos> He was close to his mother and hates the thought of a replacement.<eos> - They both do.
-Oh, thank you, Mr Barrow.<eos> How can we get it up to London?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll have plenty of time to make repairs.<eos> I must say, you're a real artist.<eos> It's as much Daisy's work as mine.<eos> Now, how much should we take and what can we buy when we get there?<eos> I'm happy to tell you that most things you can buy in Ripon are also available in London.<eos> I know, but you don't trust them quite the same, do you?<eos> Well, you don't.
No, I don't believe it does.<eos> We'll need representatives of the regiments involved and of course, a band of some sort.<eos> But I dare say that's all under control.<eos> I dare say it is, my lord.<eos> Oh, I'd like William Mason's father to have a good place.<eos> William left this house to give his life for his country.<eos> I feel that very deeply.<eos> We all do, my lord.<eos> - Will you tell the staff?<eos> -Already done.
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a mess.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Not at all, please.<eos> I just wanted to ask you if you might reconsider coming to the unveiling of the memorial.<eos> Um, I don't mean to be rude, my lord...<eos> I know that but it's important to me that reconciliation is the spirit of the day.<eos> And I should feel I had failed in this if you were to be absent from the ceremony.<eos> Please.<eos> I ask it as a favour.<eos> Very well. If it means that much to your lordship.<eos> It does.
We are forewarned and so now we will be forearmed.<eos> - You can't mean we're just going to go...<eos> -Father, please, I beg you. If you do anything to stop this marriage, anything at all, I will leave you. And then you will have a scandal worthy of the name!<eos> Oh, I doubt you expected to take your beloved child through the portals of Caxton Hall Registry Office.<eos> There are lots of things in my life I never anticipated but if you're sure, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, by the way, Atticus was blameless.<eos> I'm ashamed now that I wobbled.<eos> - I know he was blameless.<eos> -How can you know?<eos> Well I do, beyond a trace of doubt.
He had a few, but, uh... that was standard operating for Dave.<eos> He did, though, seem... kind of preoccupied.<eos> (sighs) I don't know, 25 years, you know... it's, uh, he was best man at my wedding.<eos> He and Brighty flipped for it.<eos> Eliot, if you need to take some time...<eos> Yeah, I don't... (sighing) I don't know how much good I can do here.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> We're gonna find who did this.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> I do.
You want to take a look at the plate?<eos> I can enhance it.<eos> No, no, thanks.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Hey, Al, you got a minute?<eos> Look, I, uh... I don't know what to do about this thing.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Look, I totally get why Eliot's really invested in this particular case, but I just found out he logged into my computer through a back-door program and downloaded all the files related to the O'Bannon case.<eos> I know he's our boss, but... seems kind of weird, right?<eos> Yeah, it does.
And I'm glad he was.<eos> Secret rendezvous at Jeffrey's?<eos> We had drinks.<eos> How did your makeup get on his hand?<eos> We found it.<eos> It's a little forensic thing we do.<eos> This is why, you know.<eos> We don't know each other anymore, Eliot.<eos> I mean, you don't know me.<eos> No, I don't.
We were... interns... me, Bright and Dave... for a senator.<eos> Doesn't matter who.<eos> He loved us.<eos> He gave us that atrocious nickname, the Three Amigos.<eos> Anyway, one night, uh, I get a call, 4:00 in the morning.<eos> He's in Hell's Kitchen and something's gone wrong.<eos> We go down and... find him in a room there with a, um... well, with a girl who had... been careless with her opiates.<eos> She fell asleep, never woke up.<eos> He didn't know what to do.<eos> We did.
I was wrong.<eos> The rain, it's a test.<eos> A test of my worthiness.<eos> Whose test?<eos> The dome.<eos> I believe that now.<eos> Are you prepared to surrender?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I believe in its plan.<eos> I do.
That's right.<eos> Damn!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Lyle? Please don't hurt her.<eos> You know this rain is here to rid this town of non-believers.<eos> You know that.<eos> I heard you talking to those kids at the diner.<eos> You believe.<eos> Don't you, lady?<eos> I do.
You said this was a routine op.<eos> What happened down there?<eos> ugh, chopper, please.<eos> It's been a difficult morning.<eos> He has a point, love. We've got four tie fighters closing in.<eos> Hera, how about a little less attitude and a little more altitude?<eos> If i didn't know better, i'd think you did that on purpose.<eos> If you knew better, we wouldn't be in this situation.<eos> Seriously, kanan, what happened?<eos> He did.
Nothing else.<eos> - Hey, we're losing picture.<eos> - We shouldn't be.<eos> - Joe, what's happening?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Better pull it back, Joe.<eos> Pull it back.<eos> - I'm trying. It won't come back up.<eos> - You said you knew how to fly it.<eos> - I do.
They're gonna think that I'm a fool.<eos> So this is about business? - Don't start.<eos> - No, you have not changed a damn bit.<eos> Everything I've done in business has been for our family.<eos> But you could never have seen that.<eos> If you did, you wouldn't have run off and joined the army.<eos> I wouldn't have had to pull strings to bring you home from your deployment early.<eos> - I never asked you to do that.<eos> - No.<eos> But your mother did.
As long as you don't do any more gymnastics moves - while we're down there. - Ha, ha.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - It's my phone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The signal's back and there's an e-mail.<eos> - You need to eat, Julia.<eos> - I can't. Was up all night thinking about Barbie.<eos> Julia, you'll never believe this.<eos> - He's right.<eos> I barely did.
- She was having trouble breathing.<eos> She just passed out.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know we've screwed up.<eos> Over and over again.<eos> But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
Junior!<eos> Barbie, where's Julia?<eos> She's coming.<eos> She sent me up ahead.<eos> Why's everybody stopped?<eos> Nobody knows which way to go.<eos> Barbie, we need to go this way.<eos> We saw the butterfly go down there.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> Both Joe and I do.
You stay away from my son.<eos> Don't you mean our son?<eos> No. I mean my son.<eos> He's mine, not yours.<eos> Amanda.<eos> I mean it, Jack.<eos> You cannot show up here and ruin my life, not again. That's not why I'm here.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> I want to change my life.<eos> I do.
Jeez, sorry, Dad.<eos> Look, you can't watch TV until you've done your homework, anyway.<eos> I finished.<eos> Go. Be in in a minute.<eos> What can I do for you, officers?<eos> Agents.<eos> Callahan and Rossi, FBI.<eos> Oh. My apologies.<eos> You must have worked extra hard to get that badge.<eos> We all did.
Hey, old man.<eos> The flamethrower was a nice touch.<eos> Oh, you liked that?<eos> Yeah, I added that last minute.<eos> Well, where have you been?<eos> I thought I told you not to do anything crazy.<eos> No, you said don't do anything stupid. You didn't say anything about crazy.<eos> I know.<eos> I didn't see another way.<eos> Well, I did.
Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.<eos> And I'm not blind.<eos> Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.<eos> So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.<eos> She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.<eos> Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?<eos> So, my mother's okay with this?<eos> Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?<eos> 'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.<eos> Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?
Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?<eos> We can both play this game.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Uh, does Penny live here?<eos> May I ask why?<eos> Well, uh... I-I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh...<eos> I-I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.<eos> Okay, um... Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.<eos> Oh, she did.
Get it out.<eos> I got it. I got it.<eos> - Aim for the heart. - The heart?<eos> Where's the heart?<eos> The heart... Just do it!<eos> Bull's-eye, Matt.<eos> Bull's-eye.<eos> Before his untimely death, my brother implemented a safeguard.<eos> That Triskelion she wears? It doesn't mean peace.<eos> It never did.
- What's a transporter?<eos> - Run now, talk later, okay?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Thank you for saving my life.<eos> Not yet, I haven't.<eos> Your roommates miss you.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Absolutely I have a plan.<eos> You don't...
_<eos> _<eos> Thank you for saving my life.<eos> Not yet, I haven't.<eos> Your roommates miss you.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Absolutely I have a plan.<eos> You don't...<eos> - do you?<eos> - Of course I do.
I'm asking what you want to do, Mrs. Marrone.<eos> We are going to Rome.<eos> They are going anyway.<eos> She won't listen to me.<eos> You must understand.<eos> Martino and Bernardo had a falling out over that woman.<eos> Why?<eos> Cat?<eos> I didn't know French women swore in Italian?<eos> This one does.
Crosley, you must know some of these guys.<eos> Allow me to hazard a guess.<eos> Is Wilkins Micawber on the list?<eos> - Uh, right here.<eos> - Yep.<eos> He a friend of yours?<eos> He emigrated to Australia to embark upon a new life.<eos> Unshackling himself from the chains of his own history.<eos> Well, then how did he wind up in the British delegation to the Manhattan Project?<eos> He didn't.
You could have sat back, stayed quiet, watched Thin Man fail.<eos> And let Heisenberg beat us to the punch?<eos> If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg will fall short, too?<eos> Of course.<eos> And if we fail, and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.
What, you're getting off?<eos> We have a suite at the Huntington in Pasadena.<eos> Daddy, I don't know.<eos> If they even knew I was here...<eos> Open up, please.<eos> Mrs. Isaacs, would you please come with me?<eos> Now.<eos> Mrs. Isaacs, this is a serious infraction.<eos> I would think a switchboard operator would know security regulations, chapter and verse.<eos> Absolutely, sir, I do.
Besides, all this was dealt with at Nuremberg after the war.<eos> Only 150 men were convicted at Nuremberg.<eos> By the Allies, not by the German justice system.<eos> So this isn't settled yet.<eos> I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor, I thought your court session was in the afternoon.<eos> It would be the first time that a country charges its own soldiers for their actions during a war.<eos> It's a non-starter.<eos> You know what?<eos> I love this country.<eos> I still do.
There has to be another way out of there.<eos> You have to find it.<eos> - Cait, the chain reaction, I can't reverse it.<eos> The doors need to stay shut to protect you.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - Caitlin, whatever happens--<eos> - Ronnie. Ronnie!<eos> He saved so many lives that day,<eos> And no one will ever know what he did.<eos> - I do.
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO HER?<eos> YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER. - WHY CAN'T I TALK TO HER?<eos> - YEAH, WHY CAN'T HE TALK TO ME?<eos> IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE JUST BOTH COMPLETE STRANGERS.<eos> WE ARE NOT STRANGERS.<eos> YOU'VE TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT JENNY, - I FEEL LIKE I ALREADY KNOW HER.<eos> "JENNY"?<eos> YOU TALK ABOUT ME?<eos> NO!<eos> SURE HE DOES.
I'd seemed to have fallen through time.<eos> The village has been humming with talk of ye since you came to the castle.<eos> What is it they're saying about me?<eos> I suspect you may be an English spy.<eos> I'll have you watched day and night.<eos> Redcoats wanted to send a message.<eos> This is what you get when you fight back against the English.<eos> She came back through the stones?<eos> Aye, she did.<eos> They always do.
- Can't risk missing the wireless signal again, so we're gonna have to hardwire it - into the computer.<eos> - You're the world's smartest computer guy, and this comes down to plugging something in?<eos> How exactly - do you plan on doing this?<eos> - We're gonna be driving 200 miles an hour underneath you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. You'll only have seven seconds to receive that file.<eos> Any longer, we're not gonna get this plane back up, - and we will crash.<eos> - On top of us?<eos> That will not happen, most likely.<eos> - Do it in one minute.
You, Aiden... it's all been a lie.<eos> Hasn't it?<eos> It's all been a lie.<eos> It was a lie.<eos> But it became real.<eos> I fell in love with you, Martin.<eos> And then we had our beautiful boy.<eos> I quit the Agency...<eos> To have a family, to have a real life.<eos> I did.
since I was 13 years old...<eos> Every night, I close my eyes... and all I can see is your brother... and all that blood... and my daddy.<eos> Now...<eos> I know Dean's family and all, but he gave you up.<eos> And you have no reason to protect him... none. So help me. Please.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about your dad.<eos> Whatever happened... Dean had a reason.<eos> I don't know how to tell you this. There are monsters out there.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> I did two tours in Iraq.
When I asked him why, he said,<eos> "You know why." Then you're going to get up on the stand and tell them that.<eos> I can't. I have no proof.<eos> It was vague, and it's a third party conversation.<eos> Which makes it hearsay, and I don't give a shit.<eos> Well, I do, because it opens me up to slander at best and perjury charges at worst.<eos> Well, Jeff, you used that story to get your ass in here. Now use it to get the job done.<eos> Amy!<eos> I thought I asked you to leave the Gianopolous proposal on my desk.<eos> And I did.
Our work product is covered under federal regulation and he knows that.<eos> I also know you're hiding behind your office and using his court to do it. All right, all right.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Mr. Malone, I don't appreciate you using my chambers to testify.<eos> And he may not have proof. But if one client leaves his firm and their charges miraculously disappear, you're looking at more than sanctions. You're looking at jail time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rachel.<eos> It's only been a day.<eos> You already have a suggestion for my new deal?<eos> I do.
Louis...<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no. You once told me that my actions have consequences.<eos> Your actions yesterday have consequences, too.<eos> What did you say to Gianopolous?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just that you were the person responsible for his number two leaving him.<eos> I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it.<eos> Well, what he didn't know was that it was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> Now, he does.
We leave on the winning side.<eos> Who says I'm gonna do that?<eos> What happened to "You think I'm staying if you leave?"<eos> Yeah, that was before I knew you were gonna screw over Sidwell.<eos> Amy, I... No.<eos> He may be a dick sometimes, but he's the reason you're here.<eos> You think I want this?<eos> I have to make a choice between the promise I made to Walter Gillis and what I owe Jonathan.<eos> Mike, Walter Gillis doesn't give a shit about that promise anymore.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
I'm still not gonna tell Harvey.<eos> Because you want me to owe you?<eos> Because I'm not as much of an asshole as you think I am.<eos> What about a buyout?<eos> Never going to happen.<eos> He's got a golden parachute.<eos> Well, then I've got two people on the board. I can force a vote.<eos> You do that, it triggers a stock split, his shares double in voting power, yours don't.<eos> I mean, that's all five. None of them work.<eos> No, they don't.
No problem.<eos> Elena has taken good care of me.<eos> She's my angel of mercy.<eos> How could I resist such compliments?<eos> So, let me change that.<eos> It's a wonder you're still alive.<eos> They couldn't find my remains.<eos> And now my face is all over the news.<eos> Anyone else would turn me in.<eos> Why didn't you?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I made a stupid mistake coming here.<eos> You had a warrant from Europol.<eos> Worthless in a country like this, I knew that.<eos> Obviously you didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Is he in Spain?<eos> Yeah, but, Eva's phone hasn't been on for hours.<eos> If anyone can find her, Dorn can.<eos> Okay, what about this?<eos> Anything?<eos> It's just impossible.<eos> There is no way you can access a system and not leave any trace you were there.<eos> Every time you move a mouse, the computer records it.<eos> It just does.
Oh, yes, I am very clever.<eos> But what use is clever against trees?<eos> They don't listen to reason.<eos> You can't plead with them. You can't lie to them.<eos> They have no moving parts, no circuits.<eos> This is a natural event.<eos> How can it be natural for a tree to grow in one night?<eos> Exactly what they said about the Ice Age.<eos> How can whole glaciers just pop up out of nowhere?<eos> Well, they just did.
If a child is speaking, listen to it!<eos> Oh, like you listened to her?<eos> He's right.<eos> She was trying to tell me something and I ignored her.<eos> Maebh Arden is tuned to a different channel.<eos> She can lead us to the source, to the heart of the forest.<eos> We have to listen to her, we have to find her.<eos> Not everything can be fixed with a screwdriver. It's not a magic wand.<eos> Does she have a phone?<eos> Well, yes, she does.
One person is more amazing... harder to understand, but more amazing than universes.<eos> Really?<eos> What person is that, then?<eos> I told you! I said so, didn't I?<eos> We could have a picnic. You can't.<eos> You've got marking.<eos> That was, um, from ages ago.<eos> What happened was...<eos> They always write the date neatly at the top of the page.<eos> Yeah, they do, don't they?
'I'm sorry, Clara.<eos> 'I truly am.<eos> 'I had... I had promises to keep.'<eos> ~ Hey. ~ Hey. ~ I got your message.<eos> ~ Two weeks late. ~ Not bad. ~ Improving.<eos> ~ I see you've got news for me. ~ News?<eos> He figured it out then?<eos> PE figured out there was a way home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
After everything that's happened?<eos> It's because of everything that's happened that I want you to go.<eos> No one knows that ship as well as you.<eos> My problems are down here, not up there.<eos> - You've got other qualified candidates.<eos> - None of them are you.<eos> I don't want to go to the lab.<eos> I don't either. We need a systems check.<eos> You shouldn't let your batteries get low.<eos> I didn't.
Thanks.<eos> Man, you really got to be this messed up to see your dad?<eos> If I'm gonna avoid a big blowup, it's better to be numb.<eos> - Well, not in my experience.<eos> - Oh, from a guy who was about to jump off the building, 30 minutes ago.<eos> I wasn't gonna jump, man.<eos> I was trying to get to an honest place.<eos> Something that you could benefit from.<eos> Your dad's got a nice place.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I have to admit, I was kind of nervous to ask you for help, but I'm glad I did.<eos> Nervous? Why?<eos> Because I was afraid you'd think my party ideas were lame.<eos> You're creative and alternative. I'm, like, straight and boring.<eos> Gabby, you're not boring.<eos> If anything, you're intimidating.<eos> I'm intimidating?<eos> Matty really respects you and likes you as a person.<eos> That's a lot to take on in somebody's ex. But I'm glad we're hanging out, because I like you, Jenna.<eos> I genuinely do.
Sweetie, I didn't think that I would actually get in. It's just that I never got to go, and then you're gonna be leaving me all alone, and I just thought...<eos> You just thought you'd way overstep your nonexistent boundaries and interfere with my life for the millionth time?<eos> Just leave me alone!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I needed a drinking partner.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> W-what's wrong?<eos> I didn't get into Lockard.<eos> Was that your first choice?<eos> But my mom did.
- Matty, no matter what happens, I'm sure you'll be glad you did it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - It seemed more and more that by, "let's enjoy spring break together," Matty really did mean together together.<eos> - So how long are you gonna wait?<eos> - Until Biggie comes.<eos> He said to wait right here, and so I will.<eos> My love is blind and unconditional.<eos> - Okay, good luck with that.<eos> I didn't know he was packing all of that.<eos> - I did.
Frost is that engineer.<eos> Our grains are in that tower.<eos> The food supply is at risk.<eos> We have no choice but to use force. Don't you see that?<eos> Becca, I got your message.<eos> Is my father okay?<eos> He's fine, Claire.<eos> By the power vested in me as second consul, I appoint you Lady of the City pro tern.<eos> Please take a seat.<eos> She does not havethe authority at all.
Rachel, you've been running back and forth between school and the firm like a maniac.<eos> I don't even remember the last time you got a good night's sleep.<eos> It doesn't give you the right to do that.<eos> Plus, Harvey's gonna kill me.<eos> He'll get over it.<eos> And I've got three briefs to write, plus a paper for torts and a contracts exam tomorrow.<eos> I don't have the luxury to sleep in.<eos> Then you need to ask Harvey for a day off this week.<eos> Did he ever give you time off because you were overworked?<eos> - No, he didn't.
What gave it away?<eos> Because I know you, and you don't have your usual "I'm super cool Mike Ross" face.<eos> If you knew me that well, you'd know I'm not in the mood.<eos> Mike, I'm not your enemy, and I don't appreciate being treated like I am.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> So what did Harvey say?<eos> It's not what he said. It's what he did.<eos> He knew what I was trying to do, and he called my bluff right there.<eos> He didn't even share the offer with Logan?<eos> No, he didn't.
I've checked with everyone I know.<eos> He hasn't done a thing.<eos> Me too, which is exactly why I'm worried.<eos> Jessica, I don't know what to say.<eos> If I have to look over my shoulder every 15 seconds, I might as well give up right now.<eos> Okay, but it doesn't mean you stop looking altogether.<eos> Hey, do you have a minute?<eos> Did you set up that trust?<eos> - No.<eos> - In that case, we don't.
No, that was Hanna and you said that she never mentioned--<eos> My brain is mush, too much time underwater.<eos> Hey, you want mustard?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Looks really nice in here.<eos> Glad you approve.<eos> "Quincinera."<eos> "Quin-ci-nera."<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I do.
He'll understand that you're no longer a credible witness, that you probably can't take the stand if we indict, and that there's a good chance you screwed up his whole case, not just the girl.<eos> I can't just leave her down there.<eos> You can.<eos> That's the only thing you can do.<eos> I told her I'd come back for her.<eos> You lied.<eos> You lie for a living.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The ballerina didn't used to spin.<eos> Now it does.
Aria filled me in on your great idea.<eos> It's not gonna happen, spencer.<eos> What we should be doing is burning this stuff.<eos> Emily...<eos> Ali is not our friend right now.<eos> She's a dangerous person who has no problem<eos> Gambling with our lives. She's not dangerous, she's hurt.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> She doesn't want me to tell you.<eos> Oh, no, of course, she doesn't.
And Melissa? I don't know, she may be back in Europe.<eos> She may be at the Edgewood Motor Court.<eos> The only thing I know for sure is that she isn't here.<eos> Hey, when was the last time you saw Caleb?<eos> Um... Couple of nights after my house blew up.<eos> I checked at the cabin to see if he needed anything.<eos> How did he seem to you?<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Hanna stopped drinking, but he hasn't. He says it helps him sleep.<eos> Maybe it does.
Hey, Liam!<eos> Think fast!<eos> Oh, he plays.<eos> There you go, Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Stilinski!<eos> McCall!<eos> Oh!<eos> Why do I feel like this is going to end badly?<eos> Because it usually does.
Are you still a Kitsune?<eos> Technically.<eos> These are your grandmother's ashes.<eos> Grandma died in Eichen House.<eos> Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.<eos> But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
But is it still just professionals?<eos> I don't think Haigh's ever tried anything like this.<eos> I think he was taking a chance.<eos> That means anyone with the dead pool can take a chance.<eos> But if Haigh had it, then who else does?<eos> How easy is it to get this thing now?<eos> Meredith was only at my grandmother's lake house once.<eos> But... I think once was enough.<eos> How did your grandmother know her?<eos> She didn't.
He put it online.<eos> He took the money from the Hale Vault, then turned the bearer bonds into cash.<eos> He made the payments.<eos> Was it Brunski's idea to fake your death?<eos> Did he get nervous because you helped us with one of the cipher keys?<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
(laughs) All right, boo, it is time to go home.<eos> What do you say to that?<eos> Suppose...<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Hey. Hey, we got the bad guy, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay, boo.<eos> You used to say that about Daddy.<eos> But he died.<eos> (sighs) Yeah, he did, didn't he?
She hasn't listened to you yet.<eos> Why do you think she's gonna start now?<eos> I don't know, but I've gotta try.<eos> You know, we'll go out into the woods. Drop out for however long it takes unti she learns to control this.<eos> Little late for team building, don't you think?<eos> So, what...<eos> I just abandon her?<eos> I did this.<eos> I owe her every chance to make it right.<eos> What if she never does?
You don't ever come back from that.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Come on, Sammy.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> I can't believe my own sister betrayed me.<eos> Yeah. Except she didn't.
Are you in there?<eos> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most dangerous of them all?<eos> There's been a spillage in Geography, I need some paper towels.<eos> Can't you read?<eos> Course I can read.<eos> Read what?<eos> The door.<eos> It says, "Keep Out."<eos> No, it says, "Go Away Humans."<eos> Oh, so it does.
Who speaks first, speaks for the library.<eos> Technically, that is true.<eos> That is true technically.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> No, i don't believe there should be.<eos> You do not speak for the library.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> Intercess all you want, mate, as long as i'm intercessing With my double cheese, extra pep.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't have my pizza on him.<eos> No. No, he does not.
Where is he?<eos> Fun fact, we have no idea.<eos> Fun fact, I got a warrant for his arrest.<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - At the moment, kidnapping.<eos> I anticipate an upgrade to murder, but that's just me.<eos> We've become aware of certain emails and texts he sent to Rose Marquez.<eos> Threatening ones.<eos> If you know where he is, you should tell us.<eos> We don't.
Good.<eos> Fresh start.<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> You know, you never finished telling me about your little Bonnie and Clyde stint.<eos> I bet Bonnie and Clyde did not need a matchmaking service.<eos> And look how well they turned out.<eos> Do you really think people need someone like Gwen Stein to, I don't know, make the magic happen?<eos> No. I mean, look at us.<eos> We have the magic.<eos> - We do?
Yes, and a big chandelier, great bread?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Not here. - Aw, I could've sworn it was right here.<eos> - He's got no s...<eos> You've got no sense of direction.<eos> I mean, like, zero.<eos> We went to Venice. We walked around and around in circles.<eos> Then we went on one of those little can...<eos> I mean, it was just... Do you know...?<eos> He doesn't.
We're so sorry.<eos> Maybe I could have helped if I'd known, but I'm still in the middle of things with immigration, and we're under such scrutiny, he must have been afraid any publicity would've endangered Monika.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - I've offered her a job in our home and, if she wants, some help to stay in the country.<eos> The other women will all have representation as well.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> You were right.<eos> People change.<eos> Fletcher Sayers did.
- Only she slipped.<eos> Like Dr. Bryce said, an accident.<eos> Take her to the medical centre.<eos> She's been out here way too long.<eos> You really believe this wasn't an accident?<eos> Look, I know it may sound crazy...<eos> I want you to look into it.<eos> If there is the slightest chance, we need to be sure.<eos> Captain, I don't have any experience with anything like this.<eos> Nobody does.
Things are in motion.<eos> We have two types of veve trees here: Asili and liboi.<eos> If you want to grow veve, use a one-year old seedling like this one here.<eos> These veve plants are one year old.<eos> Hello, Ladies.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Why does he restrain us from selling to other buyers?<eos> He doesn't.
It was this old worn-out shark that she got from the Starling Aquarium.<eos> Every time something awful would happen to her, I would always find her holding that stupid little shark close to her chest.<eos> And now that my sister's dead again, the only thing that I can think about is finding that dumb stuffed animal and putting it in her arms.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You have nothing to apologize for.<eos> Hey, whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.<eos> We're going to.<eos> When I thought that Sara died on the Gambit the only thing I could do was scream at the ocean.<eos> I had so much anger and rage I didn't know what to do with it.<eos> But I do now.
This city is my home, but it's yours too.<eos> So help make Star City our future.<eos> So you're the Arrow.<eos> - I thought you'd be taller.<eos> - it's over.<eos> Lower your bow and live.<eos> We both know that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Who hired you? - Who is she?<eos> - You don't wanna do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I've been really worried.<eos> Yes, I know, and I think I know why.<eos> Because I disappeared.<eos> But... I'm back now, and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'm here to stay.<eos> I just keep thinking I'll lose you again, or something terrible will happen.<eos> I know it sounds crazy...<eos> No, no, it does not sound crazy.<eos> I would feel the same way.<eos> Matter of fact, I did.
So I... I paid one of those online-reputation services to make the pictures of Kelly disappear, and they were taken down for less than a day.<eos> And then someone from her school saw them.<eos> Word got around, and my son...<eos> He saw the pictures.<eos> I tried to explain to him that this was meant to be something private between his mom and me...<eos> But he didn't see it that way, and neither did the principal, who gave Kelly the choice between resigning<eos> And a hearing in front of the school board.<eos> So, that day, on the way home from school, she pulled the car over, on the side of the road, and... She jumped from the Colorado Street Bridge.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
Ryan tried to have me assassinated.<eos> He's pushing the sniper angle.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So did we.<eos> Except the sniper hasn't killed anyone.<eos> You said why he wanted Travis dead.<eos> Why did he want to kill you?<eos> Because I know how our site ties to his other sites, which is where the real money is.<eos> The real money.<eos> W-what do yo "the real money"?
I killed him because he killed my mom.<eos> Your mother committed suicide.<eos> No, he made her do that, all right? !<eos> She... she was fine before, okay?<eos> And my mother...<eos> I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
Uh, you still doing that catering job tonight?<eos> No, no.<eos> Yeah, can I, uh, can I borrow a dress?<eos> Mine are all dirty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus, you're thin.<eos> Do I look like a prostitute in this?<eos> I don't think prostitutes wear black.<eos> Oh, expensive ones do.
He's worried about you though.<eos> I mean, I guess, he is. Because he is your dad.<eos> - Divorced?<eos> - Oh, no man, I never married.<eos> Take it from me, that is a bullet dodged.<eos> Steve Vignati.<eos> Max.<eos> Max Walters.<eos> Do you know the girl that went missing?<eos> Most everyone does.
For a long time I thought I was crazy.<eos> But I do read a suspect better than anybody.<eos> I knew when my kid was lying.<eos> I knew when my wife fell in love with someone else.<eos> You see visions, you... hear voices, it's very easy to think you're... crazy.<eos> You think you're sick, but you're not.<eos> You're not.<eos> It's just never been like this, where...<eos> It's like I did something wrong, like I hurt somebody.<eos> You didn't.
I've studied the xenon isotopes. 135 doesn't exist.<eos> Neither did a continuous nuclear reactor until today.<eos> Sometimes the most crucial elements in a reaction are pretty much invisible.<eos> Sometimes they're barely allowed in the building.<eos> Oh, Paloma.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Did you know her brother was in the Pacific?<eos> Did you know she had a brother?<eos> She said that they can't even give him a proper burial because the military didn't send the body back.<eos> They never do.
There's one way that they will.<eos> What Way?<eos> If we're divorced.<eos> The problem is that neither Clark Kent nor Bruce Wayne has a sense of humor.<eos> I know their parents died, and that's really sad, but...<eos> Honestly, even I get tired of superhero orphans.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They should make a comic book about you.<eos> You already have an origin story, right?<eos> I do?
Why frown?<eos> Stop it. I'm doing something serious...<eos> See what people say on the forum<eos> Another drug addict attempting suicide looks like she has a good body should've been a hooker to benefit society<eos> Spot on.<eos> Bastards.<eos> They don't even know why she tried to kill herself and gossip about her they have an opinion for everything all bullshit!<eos> Why did that girl jump?<eos> You know?<eos> I don't!
Look at these scuff marks.<eos> I think this bookshelf slides open.<eos> What do you think is down there?<eos> Could be a storage cellar.<eos> Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.<eos> Aiwei's coming back.<eos> What are you doing in my house?<eos> you are trespassing on the property of one of the highestranked officials in the city.<eos> You had better have a good explanation.<eos> We do, we do.
It was Martin's mom.<eos> She didn't have a clue he was here.<eos> She didn't even ask to speak to him.<eos> She was barely even worried.<eos> She called, Alison.<eos> Her son slept here last night, and she's only just noticed he's gone?<eos> She has four children.<eos> Yeah, well, so what?<eos> So she might have a bit on her mind.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Terrorism Prevention...<eos> - And if I call the police...?<eos> - Yeah... Of course.<eos> Here... use my phone.<eos> The number's 999.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do!
Alex, how much does my father know?<eos> Everything.<eos> He's been keeping her for years.<eos> Outside the walls, in the Luxor.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Because he's been having a relationship with her.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> She did.
You left the music box.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> We used to hum that song together when you were little.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, because you're not my mother.<eos> You didn't hum anything to me.<eos> And the only reason you remember is because my father told you.<eos> I thought all the years that I spent with your father, and the love that we shared, would count for something.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
You have 15 minutes to solve this charade.<eos> Hey. What the hell is this?<eos> Your stop.<eos> This ain't no stop!<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Get your... Get your hands off me!<eos> You're a dead man!<eos> Do you... you know who I am?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> He didn't send anyone.<eos> It hurts a lot. (shushes)<eos> Hold on.<eos> Fix me again. Oh, no, no.<eos> No, I can't give you any more.<eos> You'll die from an o.D. I can't do it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah, well, what about this one?<eos> Florida.<eos> Wasn't anywhere near domesticated.<eos> Brought him back to the surface for five minutes.<eos> Five minutes, and then he went into convulsions and died.<eos> And these are the only ones who carried I.D.s.<eos> What about Nevada?<eos> I believe I was out when you worked on her.<eos> Yeah, you don't want to know about Nevada.<eos> Yes, I do.
Let's ask him.<eos> Hey, don't hold back.<eos> Nobody's going inside.<eos> What are you... I got a fight.<eos> Anyone who doesn't belong here should go.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You killed Bobby and Abe.<eos> You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.<eos> We do.
How's this gonna work?<eos> What you mean, Ray?<eos> How do I know for sure you're not gonna hurt my kid?<eos> You don't.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Drop the fucking gun.<eos> There's a million dollars on that table.<eos> Five hundred thousand if you split it.<eos> A million if you don't.
As in family members?<eos> Yeah, as in women and children.<eos> You get why this is so important?<eos> Hi, my name is Laurel. I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Laurel.<eos> A week ago I...<eos> Something happened.<eos> Something that I can't share with anyone for several complicated reasons.<eos> I thought that I was gonna want a drink.<eos> But I didn't.
- For a lousy payday?<eos> - Not a payday.<eos> - It's my ticket out.<eos> - Of what?<eos> A.R.G.U.S.!<eos> You don't know the things Wailer's made me do.<eos> You don't know the things or the person she turns you into.<eos> That still gives you no right to put a bull's-eye on my family's back.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you do, John.
Yeah, well, I let the maid have her way with me for a change.<eos> I have this.<eos> Uh, State of California has once again renewed its faith that you are fit to practice medicine. Congratulations.<eos> Thank you for doing that.<eos> I am gonna head downstairs, get myself some real breakfast.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday.<eos> - You don't have to apologize.<eos> Yes...<eos> I do.
- Whitney.<eos> I'm not gonna leave.<eos> Dad, no.<eos> Get the fuck up now, Whitney.<eos> Wow, that's how you talk to your kids.<eos> You know, I pegged you as more of a family man, - the mild-mannered professor. - Stop.<eos> But clearly there's another side to you, which actually makes more sense, 'cause she sure as shit does not respond to kindness.<eos> I can tell you that.<eos> Listen, man, I know you got a lot to be upset about.<eos> Yes, I do.
What do you think this is about, asshole?<eos> You fucked my wife, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Well, how would you feel if I fucked your wife?<eos> - Stay out of this.<eos> - Put the gun...<eos> - I said shut the fuck up.<eos> There's only one thing left in this world that I still care about, and that's her.<eos> Does anything mean anything to you?<eos> Does she?

When I was a kid... my grandfather used to take my sister and me to this diner, The Motor Car.<eos> Food was for crap, but the view was great.<eos> Right across from the Central City precinct.<eos> I still go there.<eos> I listen to their radios, I learn their response times.<eos> There are 40 banks in Central City... each of them within 60 seconds of police response.<eos> That's the advantage of hitting a moving target.<eos> Once the armored car called 911 we had 182 seconds before any cop could be on the scene.<eos> No one could've gotten there fast enough to stop us.<eos> But something did.
We built the entire structure you're standing in to do good, and it blew up.<eos> You can understand why Cisco would wanna be prepared for the worst.<eos> I can understand that, but what I can't understand is... why you didn't tell me what you did.<eos> After all we've been through, I thought you trusted me.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> - We are, Barry.<eos> - If you had just told me... I could've been prepared.<eos> But instead someone died tonight.<eos> And I have to live with that.<eos> No, Cisco, we all do.
Keith's dead?<eos> I'm afraid he is. How?<eos> Did... how did that happen?<eos> We're waiting for the autopsy, but until we figure out cause of death, we're investigating it as a possible homicide.<eos> Tell us what happened last night.<eos> How'd you hurt your wrist?<eos> I fell.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.

I did.<eos> And you believe your prayers were answered.<eos> I know they were.<eos> We appreciate you wanting to confess, but we can't arrest you for praying for someone to die.<eos> Yeah, but I'm telling you the truth, and you don't believe me.<eos> Doesn't matter what we believe. It's what we can prove. Praying isn't a crime.<eos> I'm telling you, this is what happened.<eos> We'll take the jar and test the residue.<eos> If it's the same Clay that killed Keith Harrow, our lab will verify it.<eos> And if they do?
Her human and Espheni DNA strands have conjoined and become something new and altogether different.<eos> It doesn't explain her becoming an evil thing capable of killing Lourdes.<eos> - Lexi isn't evil.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> - Well, I don't accept it, either.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I've come to know your daughter these past few months, and I've come to care for her.<eos> It pains me to think she lost touch with her humanity.<eos> She didn't.
She said that the money would come.<eos> The master bedroom!<eos> We were gonna grow old together in that house, you know, raise a family, be happy.<eos> - Break it in?<eos> - Break it in!<eos> And that's what I wanted.<eos> Really good.<eos> It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore.<eos> But that day, I totally believed in it.<eos> We both did.
You don't have your helpers here with you anymore, peep.<eos> Right.<eos> I just have one.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Now, my daughter's in trouble, and I need to find the person that can help her... someone you branded.<eos> I branded a lot of people.<eos> Her name was Anna.<eos> She went by "Joan" back then.<eos> Do I look like I keep a record book?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Ortiz was killed in Stockton yesterday.<eos> And Gemma Teller seems to be MIA.<eos> We've been looking for her all morning.<eos> I'm sure she found out her scapegoat was bogus.<eos> You think she knows who did it?<eos> I think she helps get us there.<eos> Any idea why Jax Teller wants to see me?<eos> He called my office to set a time this afternoon.<eos> No idea.<eos> Maybe something to do with his mother?
Pop?<eos> Francis, I'm in the sunroom.<eos> I'm having a whiskey.<eos> You want one?<eos> We have a guest.<eos> Well, does he want one?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Jerry's partner was the detective who intervened.<eos> That was your partner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Riding with a fairy.<eos> What's that like?<eos> "If you resist arrest, I'm going to give you such a pinch."<eos> Fuentes is actually a highly decorated detective.<eos> Well, they do like decorating.<eos> Detective Fuentes also happened to save his partner's life.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Nope, I know.<eos> So, I've done business with Hoffman.<eos> He's a good detective.<eos> Why did he steal your collar?<eos> We graduated from the academy together.<eos> He was second in the class.<eos> So he just has it out for number one?<eos> I don't know what his problem is.<eos> But he made detective and you haven't yet, so maybe you have the same kind of problem.<eos> Maybe I do.
So he just has it out for number one?<eos> I don't know what his problem is.<eos> But he made detective and you haven't yet, so maybe you have the same kind of problem.<eos> Maybe I do.<eos> But I play by the rules.<eos> Until now.<eos> Fire with fire.<eos> Or two wrongs not making a right.<eos> Do you always get the last word?<eos> Yes, I do.
You're disappointed.<eos> Does it matter what I feel?<eos> I thought you'd lost your mind.<eos> The airplane thing, this "happy" app.<eos> Maybe you did go a little bit crazy, Neil.<eos> But the reality is, your crazy found us a whole new stream of revenue.<eos> Product development.<eos> Plus, I got this little guy out of the deal.<eos> I don't really care about my other employees' feelings.<eos> I just don't.
Neil Truman.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> I can't stand here and say that a dating application was the result I had in mind when our two companies began our dialogue.<eos> But then, Victor came to my house yesterday, because that's the kind of diligent managing partner we have here at bastion.<eos> And he asked me if I could overcome my disappointment, if I could let go of that perfect application that I had bouncing around inside my head for so many weeks, and to move on.<eos> And so I considered letting it go.<eos> But then I changed my mind.<eos> I don't exactly work that way.<eos> There is no result that we can offer our customers that will meet their expectations, and they know that.<eos> At least the rational ones do.
- From who?<eos> Eiling?<eos> - Eiling is a dangerous man, barry.<eos> We do not want him as an enemy.<eos> - After the lighting bolt, what if you hadn't found me?<eos> It could've been me.<eos> Hunted, on the run, cut off from everyone I know and care about.<eos> You guys saved me.<eos> - And I want to save her just as bad as you do, barry.<eos> We all do.
- YEAH, BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE<eos> TO BE THE PISSED-OFF HUSBAND IN THIS SCENARIO.<eos> - YOU WEREN'T THAT BIG A PROBLEM.<eos> - OH, YEAH?<eos> - YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE PROJECTING YOUR OWN SH--, NEIL.<eos> 95% OF THE GUYS IN THIS SITUATION<eos> WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.<eos> - AND THE OTHER FIVE PERCENT? OF COURSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.<eos> YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO CARE ABOUT SOMEONE THAT MUCH,<eos> WHAT THAT DOES TO YOU.
Mmm. Thank you.<eos> Simon.<eos> I think I'm ready for round two.<eos> Couldn't get in touch with my accountant.<eos> He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
I wanted to share something with you.<eos> That will be your consistent monthly returns now that I control your account.<eos> This is another number.<eos> Your wife came to see me this week.<eos> Were you aware?<eos> She's a very shrewd woman.<eos> - She is, indeed.<eos> - I was informed of something.<eos> And as your financial advisor, I felt that I should tell you about it.<eos> But before I do, if I do,
O del si lasho.<eos> That not Romanian.<eos> That Romani.<eos> Romani, language of the Roma people. Gypsy people, yes?<eos> You racist bastards.<eos> You think all Roma is from Romania. Is not.<eos> Roma many places. Bulgaria, Poland, Spain.<eos> Romani different language, like Welsh to English.<eos> Do you speak fucking Welsh?<eos> - Yeah, I do, actually.
- Yes, it will work perfectly.<eos> - Fuck. He speaks English?<eos> But not in the way she thinks.<eos> She said we couldn't choose.<eos> I made an adjustment.<eos> I wanted to help evolution, you see.<eos> - I chose.<eos> - You mean a race?<eos> - You chose a race?<eos> - I did.

Gabriel's not coming.<eos> He should have been here by now. Something's off.<eos> Let's go back to Vega.<eos> AUTOMATED VOICE:<eos> Warning. Perimeter breach.<eos> Warning.<eos> Perimeter breach.<eos> (GUARD SHOUTING)<eos> Got ID?<eos> I do.
(INHALES AND EXHALES) ls it true?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, Alex. Claire...<eos> Look, the truth is, I wasn't actually going to tell you.<eos> I thought it would be better if you didn't know.<eos> How could that ever be better?<eos> Because you can't be a father to this child.<eos> That isn't your choice to make.<eos> You have no idea what kind of father I'd be.<eos> Yes, I do, Alex, and so do you.
Does that include playing at being a CSI?<eos> Processing your own crime scenes?<eos> That was me just having a little fun with my friend, Mr. Russell.<eos> Right down to stalking his daughter?<eos> How is Maya?<eos> Those last three girls you killed, where are their bodies?<eos> 'Cause the families want closure, right?<eos> But... this ain't the movies.<eos> And, trust me, they do not want to see them now.<eos> But maybe someone else does.
A dangerous game is being played throughout the city.<eos> I'm trying to find the game master.<eos> I've accessed the feeds from a security camera whose field includes a lamppost where one of the game's puzzles was posted.<eos> By scrolling back through the archived footage, I hope to identify who put it up.<eos> There.<eos> Toby's Estate Coffee.<eos> Game master is a barista?<eos> Right across the street.<eos> So this guy likes to play games, huh?<eos> Well, so do I.
I don't consider myself a vain person, although others might if I wallpaper my home with selfies.<eos> But you raise a fair point.<eos> You're married?<eos> Um, yes.<eos> How long?<eos> 18 years.<eos> I've always admired people who can commit like that to another person.<eos> There's so much risk involved in marriage.<eos> Well, it has its rewards.<eos> So does divorce.
Oswald Darcy.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you.<eos> How was your flight from Zurich?<eos> Sorry, Mr. Darcy, but we're on a very tight schedule.<eos> Of course.<eos> Please, this way.<eos> Okay... you guys are lookin' good.<eos> Mr. Miller, I need your hand scan.<eos> You don't take any chances, do you, Mr. Darcy?<eos> No, we don't.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> We never spoke after, and I'm so sorry...<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I heard about your mother and...<eos> She loved you very much.<eos> She did.
No, uh, I find them both clear. Overruled.<eos> Yes, Mr. Roja, at one time, worked for Mr. Bishop.<eos> In his... drug empire.<eos> Objection... not in evidence. Sustained.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, when Mr. Roja gave you this money, was Mr. Bishop present?<eos> Yes. He was there?<eos> Mr. Bishop was there?<eos> Yes, but on another matter.<eos> Uh, does the ASA have any more questions?<eos> Hmm. Yes, I do.
Shouldn't be too long.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, well. You bring another police escort?<eos> Just us bad guys.<eos> We had nothing to do with the sheriffs.<eos> Of course, you gunned them down, so now they're everyone's problem.<eos> We hear the bitch lived.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?
All right.<eos> Well, well. You bring another police escort?<eos> Just us bad guys.<eos> We had nothing to do with the sheriffs.<eos> Of course, you gunned them down, so now they're everyone's problem.<eos> We hear the bitch lived.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?<eos> Well, if she does...
How much I love my guys.<eos> You can't let this pull you off track, Jackie.<eos> Those guys downstairs... they need you focused... and strong.<eos> Look what I've done, man.<eos> Diosa...<eos> Colette...<eos> West.<eos> Now Bobby.<eos> Bobby knows the risks.<eos> We all do.
And I killed him.<eos> You know this means a Mayhem vote.<eos> Jesus, Jax.<eos> I know the pain you're in because of Tara, and we all understand your need for vengeance.<eos> Maybe that fueled this mistake.<eos> But what you're saying here is out-and-out murder, brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mayhem has to land.<eos> I know.<eos> Does your charter?
No. Connor doesn't know that Tyler's with us.<eos> We get him to call, tell Connor that Marks needs a shipment of guns when he gets out and that black will give him half the money down.<eos> Connor shows up for a duffle full of cash.<eos> Yeah, he will. I'll set it up.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to bother you. Um, I just got a call from your grandfather's nursing home.<eos> I guess Gemma's visiting her dad.<eos> Really.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yeah, well I didn't, either.
I'm sure you know the answer to that.<eos> I need you to come with me.<eos> Uh... back to Sanwa.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I know about Tara.<eos> I assumed you did.<eos> Should I ask why?<eos> It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
No.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> I have to arrest you, Gemma.<eos> Fifth grade.<eos> I wrote an essay on the importance of the Second Amendment.<eos> Got a B+.<eos> I knew even then where I was headed.<eos> Jax is on his way.<eos> He finds you here, I don't know what happens.<eos> I do.
Secured herself a lawyer.<eos> - So what happens now?<eos> - Well, Mr. Marks has his hearing the day after tomorrow.<eos> And before he posts bail and comes home, I have a task to complete.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I need to talk to the pastor's family, convince them to rethink their statement.<eos> Teller's protecting them.<eos> I need you to find out where.<eos> We do business together.
The Librarians are in the labyrinth.<eos> I sent them there alone.<eos> Why?<eos> To keep them safe.<eos> That was a very bad idea.<eos> Although I will say I'm impressed.<eos> We've had guardians lose Librarians in the past of course. But never three in one day.<eos> It'll be quite some time before anyone beats that.<eos> So how do we get them out?<eos> We don't.
To Utah.<eos> Your father wants us to stay on for good.<eos> You still ain't said if that's what you want.<eos> I can't think about goin' back.<eos> Naomi.<eos> We're better off here.<eos> Me and William, and don't say that you don't see that.<eos> You ain't had it easy in Cheyenne.<eos> I know that, all right?<eos> I do.
Look at me.<eos> Just keep looking at me.<eos> She's ready.<eos> Yeah. That was me at the Grounder camp.<eos> You now, I did everything I could not scream, but eventually... but eventually, you broke and you told them everything.<eos> And you wouldn't have because you're better than me.<eos> Damn right.<eos> I'm not a traitor.<eos> I didn't tell them where they could find us.<eos> And I did.
Is it true?<eos> - I'm... I'm sorry, Alex.<eos> - Claire...<eos> Look, the truth is, I wasn't actually going to tell you.<eos> I thought it would be better if you didn't know.<eos> How could that ever be better?<eos> Because you can't be a father to this child.<eos> That isn't your choice to make.<eos> You have no idea what kind of father I'd be.<eos> Yes, I do, Alex, and so do you.
Or I...<eos> I had a feeling that felt a lot like love.<eos> In the name of that feeling... I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.<eos> You name the cliché, that was me.<eos> And so how did it end?<eos> Rush got me out.<eos> The rest doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> It matters a lot.<eos> Oh, no... it doesn't.
Is she really over him?<eos> Will she ever be over him?<eos> You know, should I just step aside?<eos> Hmm. Give me that thing.<eos> Listen, I-I thought you had a rule about not drinking before public speaking.<eos> I can drink your ass under the table.<eos> Just give it.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> She does talk about you a lot though.<eos> - She does?
These are the spirits of dead miners, and your husband, that you murdered, was a miner!<eos> Oh, restless spirit of this house, I summon thee to seek thy revenge!<eos> Lannis? No!<eos> Let go of me! No!<eos> I'm the victim!<eos> Moving in, are we? You wish.<eos> Well, I'm afraid I'm in no mood for sparring tonight, darling. Of course not.<eos> You almost died.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you're okay.<eos> No, you didn't.
Oh, I will.<eos> But, alas, you won't be there to see it.<eos> Where the hell did he go?<eos> Exactly where I need him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just one?<eos> Sven, stop pouting.<eos> You love carrots. What is wrong with you?<eos> Think maybe he missed me?<eos> Oh! Not nearly as much as I did.
We don't expect you to.<eos> I'll get you some proper clothes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother's flat... in Pochep... is smaller than this room.<eos> You could fit in the whole flat in here.<eos> Twice.<eos> Mariana won't believe me that I stay in a place like this.<eos> You think I'm stupid to think Mariana is alive.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
He says it's God's will and the men can't be rescued.<eos> You tell him God helps those who help themselves.<eos> - Is that from the Bible?<eos> - The Koran.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're both getting back in your trucks.<eos> - What for?<eos> - You're gonna back them up.<eos> What good will that do?<eos> Just do it!
One patch is not enough.<eos> Yeah, I could have told you that from your chewed-up fingernails.<eos> That's a pretty good parlor trick.<eos> You putting those skills to work in the field?<eos> I got a lead on Wendy Montgomery's murder.<eos> Realtor was shot walking home from work.<eos> Looked like a mugging.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her husband was the prime suspect, but we didn't have any real leads.<eos> Well, we do now.
~ Just wait, wait, wait, stop.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> Please. Em.<eos> Believe me - they know each other.<eos> Em... .. if we keep shutting each other out...<eos> .. we're going to lose each other.<eos> And if that happens, what else is there?<eos> They know each other.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.

He's got them to get us new passports, IDs, everything.<eos> It'll be another country tomorrow.<eos> It's a whole new life for all of us.<eos> This is the right thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> All ready to go.<eos> Did they manage to pick up the other canisters?<eos> - The virus?<eos> - They did.
This one's from Brazil.<eos> And the Kenyan one is made by a woman's collective, and the proceeds go to their daughters' education.<eos> But the Brazilian one is made from recycled cardboard pulp, which is kind of amazing.<eos> Negligible.<eos> Um, I have to skype this morning with Leslie, so we can do inventory. Can you take the kids?<eos> Well, I'm supposed to have a breakfast meeting with Harry.<eos> Oh, good, he called you.<eos> Actually, I called him.<eos> - I told him to call you.<eos> - He didn't.
I really like you.<eos> - You're married.<eos> - And you have a family.<eos> - I do.<eos> - And you love them.<eos> - Of course.<eos> And you don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.<eos> You just made that pretty easy for me.<eos> I get it.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm sorry, Bailey.<eos> I don't want to be the one to tell you.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's o...<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> - I don't have a fucking car.<eos> - I don't...
True but gross.<eos> And why?<eos> Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.<eos> Including plague.<eos> Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.<eos> It's like the world's most secure petri dish.<eos> Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.<eos> How did it get on board?<eos> I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.<eos> Or did it?
No, I'm just trying to figure out why you're so different.<eos> How about just being my big brother instead?<eos> Okay.<eos> Target's on the move.<eos> He's headed north.<eos> He stopped.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> He's buying ice cream.<eos> He doesn't look like a terrorist.<eos> - The best ones never do.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - One I hope you're not getting mixed up with.<eos> - No. I'm just doing Sara a favor.<eos> And her?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oliver told me of his plan to involve you in the hunt for Sara's killer.<eos> I have a handle on it.<eos> Your father doesn't know, does he?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Because he swore to me on his daughter's life.<eos> We had heard rumors Merlyn fathered another child.<eos> We couldn't confirm them.<eos> - You know who it is.<eos> - I do.<eos> If you put me through the effort of finding out on my own I might have to exact a price from whoever it is you're protecting.<eos> It's Thea.<eos> My sister is Merlyn's daughter.<eos> And that is the reason he came back to Starling City.<eos> Because she did.
And that is why you spared Merlyn, twice.<eos> It had nothing to do with that.<eos> He explained to me, in his own twisted way, that he loves her.<eos> And then he swore to me on her life.<eos> And I swore an oath of my own that I would see Sara's killer brought to justice.<eos> Nyssa.<eos> - Nyssa!<eos> - Oliver, wait.<eos> We have to stop her.<eos> - Do we?
And then he swore to me on her life.<eos> And I swore an oath of my own that I would see Sara's killer brought to justice.<eos> Nyssa.<eos> - Nyssa!<eos> - Oliver, wait.<eos> We have to stop her.<eos> - Do we?<eos> Listen, I understand why you can't kill Merlyn, all of the reasons.<eos> - Maybe he killed Sara, maybe he didn't.<eos> - He didn't.
I'm to blame for not protecting him.<eos> The fault is mine alone.<eos> You were also a target.<eos> You needn't blame yourself, my prince.<eos> His Majetsy is blessed.<eos> Heaven preserves worthy rulers.<eos> Mr. Zhuge thinks His Majesty was blessed today?<eos> !<eos> Do you think otherwise?<eos> No I don't.
I apologize for barging in like this, but we have news from one of our scouts.<eos> Have you found Anna?<eos> No, but they discovered something else in their search.<eos> What does it say?<eos> There's an army massing in the southern mountains, heading for Arendelle.<eos> Led by Prince Hans.<eos> (SIGHS) Well, I know every inch of those mountains.<eos> Let me sneak up there and see what he's up to.<eos> I didn't realize the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer got a say in matters.<eos> He doesn't.
- Exactly.<eos> So I'm working me way down Main Street when I break into the ice cream parlor and see the strangest thing.<eos> There'd been no electricity for hours. But still all the ice cream was frozen solid.<eos> Now, how does something like that happen?<eos> REGINA: The curse is working its way towards her heart.<eos> Once it touches, that's it.<eos> Is there nothing you can do?<eos> There might be something.<eos> But only if you trust me completely.<eos> I do.
So let's say we'll start at ten and work from there.<eos> - And I don't take insurance.<eos> - That's a lot of money.<eos> Well, he's free to go to the ER if he doesn't like the terms.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I...<eos> I'm certain that he... he'll accept the terms.<eos> Text me the address.<eos> I went to look for a sperm donor.<eos> And... he just went with you?<eos> He did indeed. Huh.
What are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to see where you work.<eos> And I thought, you know... maybe we could get together again.<eos> Get together?<eos> Yeah, like lunch or dinner or...<eos> - whenever you get off.<eos> - You got the wrong idea.<eos> Wh... (sighs) What we did... that was a one-time thing.<eos> - (laughs) It doesn't have to be.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Evolutionary leaps follow the creation of new technologies.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> Like the Roomba.<eos> Yes, like the Roomba.<eos> So humor me here.<eos> If we know that meta-humans were created by the particle accelerator and testimony shows that a meta-human may have been involved in the murder of Barry Allen's mother 14 years ago it seems to me that way back then there must have been another particle accelerator.<eos> Another particle accelerator?<eos> I can assure you that's extremely unlikely, detective, and if there were I don't recall any dark-matter lightning storms before I moved to town.<eos> Do you?<eos> No. No, I don't.
And easy on the gas.<eos> Nothin' out here.<eos> No people, no gas, not even Zs.<eos> Nah, we got to go back.<eos> There is no help out here.<eos> There's no help back there either.<eos> We have to go back, Mack.<eos> We have a mission.<eos> We made a promise.<eos> No, we didn't.

I need to take your blood and figure out what happened.<eos> I can't believe he's dead.<eos> Dr. Wells?<eos> No. No. Tony Woodward.<eos> - He escaped the Pipeline.<eos> - He must've got out when the blackout hit.<eos> Not possible.<eos> The Pipeline was designed to withstand power outage.<eos> Someone had to have let him go.<eos> I did.
These Santas have been in my family for generations.<eos> Creepy. It's not creepy.<eos> It's a tribute to the true meaning of Christmas.<eos> Sad.<eos> I have to tell a grown-up that Santa isn't real.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> It's okay, Mr. Bramble.<eos> You don't have to lie to me.<eos> My Mom already told me the truth.<eos> She did?
It is an apology.<eos> You want me to buy VersaLife?<eos> We want you to buy a division of VersaLife.<eos> The division that makes that drug.<eos> They've been working on anti-addiction meds for years.<eos> Look at the results.<eos> This one works.<eos> But it's a money-loser, and it's gonna take years.<eos> They don't have the capital, the patience, or the will.<eos> But you do.
What?<eos> Well, it's not my boat.<eos> My father and had half the Navy in the Red Sea when this happened and it looks like they took the lead in the rescue operation.<eos> It was so cool!<eos> I shot out of the cave and into the air, Then into the ocean, and then I was pulled up on the boat... and we were jumping waves! it was so much fun!<eos> -Whoa whoa! Of course you did!<eos> Of course you did, buddy.<eos> It's all so surreal.<eos> Just glad our family made it.<eos> So many others didn't.
TV: 'If you have him, we are begging you, please let him go.<eos> 'Take him to somewhere safe and let the police know where he is.<eos> 'Please bring him back to his family, 'who love him.<eos> 'Please bring him home.<eos> Now, who loves you?<eos> Dad. Yeah.<eos> Hi, it's Mark Walsh. I'm the UK liaison officer.<eos> Laurence Relaud.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> Yes, I do.
This is nice.<eos> You know, the Nazis used it as the official theme music for their weekly newsreel service.<eos> Even they could see the beauty in it.<eos> It reminds you that the people who do these terrible things, they are just people.<eos> Not some kind of devils.<eos> Just ordinary people.<eos> That's why you wanted Tony Hughes' bank statements?<eos> You think he could...<eos> I think I need to know everything.<eos> At the moment I don't.
TV works in this room at least.<eos> Tony, I think I've made a mistake.<eos> I thought I'd be OK, I thought...<eos> I'm coping a lot better now, but I just...<eos> This room, it's just the same.<eos> Sylvie's been so nice to us, you know, so good.<eos> I mean, Christ knows the amount of business we must've cost them over the last few years, her and Alain.<eos> It's the least we can do.<eos> Doesn't it get to you?<eos> Of course it does.
Um, I don't see anything on his schedule.<eos> What was your name?<eos> - Mateo.<eos> - Mr. Truman.<eos> Were you expecting someone?<eos> He called me directly.<eos> Babe, just get back to me when you get this call, okay?<eos> Hey, I really appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.<eos> I figured it was your lunch hour, so you like turkey?<eos> I do.
It has so much storage.<eos> Okay, my mom is drinking wine, and she's much more agreeable on wine.<eos> Was my dad drinking?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> [Exhales] How we doing?<eos> Good, good.<eos> Did you download this?<eos> No, I already had the template.<eos> I just made some tweaks.<eos> I did a pre-law summer symposium thing in high school.
- $10,000 a month.<eos> Ten?<eos> Right.<eos> Uh... well, I was thinking something more in the neighborhood, of, uh... 20.<eos> Welcome to the Yurt.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So, where do I start?<eos> I mean, uh, since I'm on the clock now.<eos> Oh, I don't think we have any medical issues at the moment.<eos> We rarely do, actually.
What about the mole?<eos> I called my partner Thomsen.<eos> He's the one guy I trust.<eos> I'm Agent Lennox, but you can call me Erica.<eos> I work for the DEA. Do you know what that means?<eos> - We got TV.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I need you to tell me about the drug exchange.<eos> One of you must've seen something.<eos> What if I did?
Or I huff and puff and burn your house down.<eos> I don't think you wanna tell your boss you watched his stash go up in flames, do you?<eos> Say I let the detective go.<eos> - How do I know you're gonna back off?<eos> - I'll leave you a parting gift.<eos> Mini here can keep your drugs company.<eos> Guess it's not your lucky day after all.<eos> Never said who you worked for.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> You're a fucking puppet, whoever you are.<eos> I'm a patriot, you understand?<eos> I'm a freedom fighter.<eos> Say something, you fucking jerk.<eos> What are you, a robot?<eos> A fucking socialist robot?<eos> Sell your soul for some shitty car and a three-bed house you never even pay out.<eos> You don't even understand what it means to be free.<eos> Nobody does anymore.
Say something, you fucking jerk.<eos> What are you, a robot?<eos> A fucking socialist robot?<eos> Sell your soul for some shitty car and a three-bed house you never even pay out.<eos> You don't even understand what it means to be free.<eos> Nobody does anymore.<eos> Free to be.<eos> To choose, want and to take... who know what it means to get it.<eos> You go to college?<eos> Yeah, sure I did.
This access code.<eos> We've tried every decryption routine there is, but we're getting nowhere.<eos> Well, you could just let me help you.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Have you ever heard of acoustic cryptoanalysis?<eos> The analysis of the sound produced during encryption processing...<eos> We know what it is.<eos> Yeah, well, I run that puppy, chances are it can reverse-code even the most secure site.<eos> Not even the FBI has that capability.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.

Well, he and Franny seem to have hit it off.<eos> Can I borrow him for a minute?<eos> Course.<eos> What'd you find out?<eos> Crocker swears up and down there was no engagement with Islamabad of any kind.<eos> What about an overture to Haqqani?<eos> He calls that "unthinkable."<eos> "Political suicide."<eos> How does he explain Dar Adal on the ground, then?<eos> - He doesn't.
Yeah, well, that medal of honor you earned says otherwise.<eos> Thank you. You ever go by the marina, see if our old fishing boat's still there?<eos> Well, not since we sold it.<eos> Mmm. - Had some good times on that boat.<eos> - Yeah. Be fun to see who has her now.<eos> No calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> My union rep advised me not to come down here, but I told him you and I got history.<eos> And we do.
You were right.<eos> I don't want to be right about this.<eos> Okay, half-right.<eos> How?<eos> Detective Clark's blood alcohol level was over the legal limit when he was admitted with the gunshot wound.<eos> No word yet on your friend's Breathalyzer.<eos> Because?<eos> Because either he wasn't given one or my source hasn't been able to get the results yet.<eos> Regulations mandate that an officer be screened for alcohol after discharging his weapon causing injury or death.<eos> Yes, they do.
I'll talk to Jessica for you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're off the hook with Cahill.<eos> He's gonna start with me and Harvey in the morning.<eos> Am I?<eos> Are you what?<eos> Off the hook.<eos> Rachel... I didn't mean for what happened to happen.<eos> But it did.
Oh, Cherry, I can't.<eos> No, you must.<eos> Please, try it on.<eos> Try it on.<eos> I want to thank you for taking care of my son.<eos> He acts like he doesn't need anyone.<eos> And maybe you think he doesn't really need you.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I...<eos> He does.
What the hell is going on out there?<eos> I don't want you writing one word - until we talk to Gottlieb.<eos> - I left a message.<eos> And you're not going over to this girl's house. Excuse me.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> If she does that, she's basically conceding guilt.<eos> - She is guilty. - We don't know that.<eos> It sounds like this Jody character is unstable, Noah.<eos> And she has no proof of Whitney's culpability.<eos> - She doesn't?
I'll scoop the shite clean out of your skull!<eos> Mr. McGinnes, control your man!<eos> I said stop, come now.<eos> I heard ya, Mick!<eos> Thing is, I love ya, but I don't work for ya!<eos> A madman.<eos> That's what they called my father.<eos> The n' Wm'?<eos> I used to hate reporters.<eos> I still do... sometimes.
Track down whoever Myron shared your code with.<eos> I hacked all of his e-mails and texts from five years ago, and all I got was depressed. - Okay, what about your ex?<eos> - I already told you, he didn't do it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's your ex-boyfriend?<eos> Because". ...my senior year of college, Cooper and I did a stupid thing.<eos> He got arrested and he went to prison.<eos> So he went to prison.<eos> Maybe he got out.<eos> He didn't.
Randy will take you back.<eos> Your name is Randy?<eos> That took long enough.<eos> You burnt the damn thing!<eos> No, it's medium well, just like you like it.<eos> After all I did for you...<eos> Took care of our little problem, didn't I?<eos> Or did you forget?<eos> Oh, you don't want to talk about it, huh?<eos> Well, maybe I do.
We're driving out of here together. No.<eos> You won't.<eos> You stand down or I swear I'll take us all out.<eos> Right here, right now!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you were gonna do it, you would've done it already.<eos> What are you waiting for? Do it!<eos> You heard him.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.
You won't.<eos> You stand down or I swear I'll take us all out.<eos> Right here, right now!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you were gonna do it, you would've done it already.<eos> What are you waiting for? Do it!<eos> You heard him.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
Your world has to be bigger than just you and me, Booth.<eos> It is, all right?<eos> I'm back to work, aren't I?<eos> Well, objectively that's true.<eos> But you still don't seem to trust anyone.<eos> And you have to, to do this job.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Then listen to me.<eos> Sweets said that you have to believe in something again, something bigger than yourself.<eos> I do.
But you still don't seem to trust anyone.<eos> And you have to, to do this job.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Then listen to me.<eos> Sweets said that you have to believe in something again, something bigger than yourself.<eos> I do.<eos> My family.<eos> You haven't been to church since you've been released.<eos> You don't even believe in God.<eos> But you do.
Excuse me?<eos> Do you really think you're gonna do better than me?<eos> You should get out while you can. Look, I know that what happened to you is messed up.<eos> And then what happened to Sweets.<eos> But remember that Sweets trusted me to work with you.<eos> So when you treat me like crap, you're treating Sweets like crap, too.<eos> Here's everything I got from talking to the hotel.<eos> Good luck with the wife.<eos> I don't know what the fuss is all about-- so I requested a ground floor room at my hotel.<eos> Lots of people do that.
Why would I kill Hutch?<eos> Without him, my career is finished.<eos> Well, I couldn't agree with you more, right?<eos> Which is why you used your cell phone to video Hutch in his S and M gear.<eos> So you could blackmail him, force him to stay on the show.<eos> What you didn't realize was the handcuffs had a safety release.<eos> When Hutch saw you, he freed himself and attacked.<eos> That's when you struck him in the face with your cell phone, causing Hutch to drown in his own blood.<eos> You have no proof of anything you just said.<eos> Oh, no. Actually, we do.
Oh, many of our countrymen have settled there.<eos> Of course, they've lost everything, but so have we.<eos> Including the will to live.<eos> Well, if you're going to be miserable, you might as well do it in charming surroundings.<eos> With your permission, I am going up now.<eos> I hope you will be comfortable.<eos> My maid, Denker, will be looking after you.<eos> I will be more comfortable tonight than I will ever be again.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> But I do, Mrs Crawley.
The fact is, I've grown extremely fond of you, Tom.<eos> Sybil would be amazed to hear it but I have.<eos> Always remember you have a home to come back to.<eos> Sybil will be very touched. As am I.<eos> And, yes, I will think of Downton as my home.<eos> And that would have amazed Sybil, I've no doubt about it.<eos> Now, what should Marigold call me?<eos> Donk!<eos> Why not?<eos> Everyone else does.
- No way!<eos> Cut her loose!<eos> Acid fog.<eos> Monroe, get back on the rope!<eos> Come on!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to take cover from the fog.<eos> Bellamy.<eos> No, we don't.
Mount weather.<eos> The grounders took you to mount weather? No.<eos> The mountain men.<eos> We have to get them out.<eos> We're not doing this right now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Clarke.<eos> Mom.<eos> Did anyone else make it here?<eos> Yes. 6 of you did.
Come on.<eos> Sorry about the rope.<eos> At least we know he can talk.<eos> I wish i could.<eos> He doesn't understand<eos> A word we're saying. It's a tactic.<eos> If we think he doesn't speak english,<eos> We won't expect him to tell us anything.<eos> Due respect sir, then why do we expect him To lead us to his commander And not into a trap?<eos> We don't.
Or evidence of your lack of emotional maturity? Both.<eos> I don't have emotions.<eos> I read that in your file.<eos> But how can you protect something if you don't care about it?<eos> I care about my paycheck.<eos> I can't really tell if you're purposely being contemptuous, of maybe you are unstable.<eos> Well, if you dismissed every government worker who was unstable,<eos> Washington would cease to exist.<eos> Giving these responses, how do you expect me to approve you?<eos> I don't.
Somewhere along the line, you had a breakthrough.<eos> You're improving. Okay, Labeaux made half a dozen calls to one number in the 48 hours before the original painting disappeared.<eos> The name is encrypted, but I think I can break it.<eos> In how long?<eos> That long. And I thought I didn't like him 'cause he was a know-it-all art jerk.<eos> Here's an e-mail from Labeaux to Paulson with his bank's routing and account numbers.<eos> Labeaux provides access to the fake,<eos> Paulson provides access to the original.<eos> We didn't find the painting at Labeaux's because he never had it.<eos> Paulson does.
Coulson has a plan.<eos> I can't believe you would sacrifice one of your own agents.<eos> We all take risks in this business.<eos> In your case, it just didn't pay off.<eos> I had no choice!<eos> Tiny violin's playing, but no one's listening, sweetheart.<eos> Who's making you do this?<eos> HYDRA.<eos> They want the Obelisk, but you don't have it.<eos> Skye's father does.
Okay.<eos> We should probably get started.<eos> So, this is what you've been doing up here.<eos> Well, it's what I did yesterday.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it, but it needs to be carved.<eos> Does it just appear in your mind, like some sort of vision?<eos> No. It just kind of happens.<eos> Which is really frustrating because no matter how much I carve, it still means nothing to me. I don't even have a theory.<eos> I do.
What is it?<eos> I know how to stop the attack.<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> We should go.<eos> You ready?<eos> Even if you can save lincoln...<eos> He won't be the same.<eos> The things he's done... They'll stay with him.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
They're here.<eos> Initiated evacuation plan 2a.<eos> Report to your station supervisor for further instructions.<eos> They're not attacking yet,<eos> Which means we still have time.<eos> We have two hours till dawn.<eos> Let me talk to the commander. She was anya's second.<eos> Maybe she'll listen.<eos> We don't even know if the commander's here.<eos> Yes, we do.
You don't look so good, chief.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> I need to get out of here now.<eos> Roberta!<eos> Roberta!<eos> Hi, Charlie.<eos> Why didn't you...<eos> How did you...<eos> I tried to go home.<eos> I did.
Can I ask you a question? Shoot.<eos> Why haven't we...<eos> Dated?<eos> You know, that's funny, 'cause I was just asking myself the same thing.<eos> Come up with anything?<eos> 'Cause in about two seconds, we'd be broken up, crossing paths at work, and that would just be...<eos> Uncomfortable.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Guess we got something to look forward to.<eos> Yes, we do.
In her quarters, I think.<eos> Well, go get her. This is no time to sulk.<eos> It's all hands on deck.<eos> Any luck with the nurse, Max?<eos> Got a partial read on the name tag.<eos> I should be able to get a match from the hospital staff database.<eos> How do we know the drugs were for Haqqani himself?<eos> Because Aayan told me.<eos> But he didn't say what they were for?<eos> No, he didn't.
Now, this is totally unacceptable, Madam Ambassador.<eos> What's unacceptable is the double dealing your country's been engaged in for decades.<eos> Minister, please...<eos> So, here's what's going to happen.<eos> Either Saul Berenson gets returned to this embassy quickly and quietly, or we put Pakistan's $2 billion-a-year aid package under immediate review.<eos> Good day, Madam Ambassador.<eos> Who in God's name told you threats get you anywhere in this country?<eos> Money always talks.<eos> You don't have that kind of authority.<eos> But I do.
No, no, no. - I'm here.<eos> You're not.<eos> You're not.<eos> Why not?<eos> Is it so hard to believe?<eos> I want to.<eos> I w... I...<eos> I want...<eos> I want to believe.<eos> Then do.
They would kill to see these in Tehran.<eos> How does an Iranian end up working for Mossad?<eos> How did the FBI end up working for Reddington?<eos> How'd you find us in Warsaw?<eos> Who told you we were there?<eos> Medical examiner just called.<eos> He needs to see you.<eos> Stat.<eos> - How do we know we can trust her?<eos> - We don't.
How do you explain that?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll answer for you.<eos> You're a supplier for Dr. James Covington.<eos> You provide vital organs for him to sell and he pays you through the Wellbright Fund.<eos> I don't know Covington.<eos> I was approached by an associate about providing him with viable material.<eos> You deal with bodies.<eos> - I thought donor organs had to be fresh.<eos> - They do.
I love that you can do that.<eos> Just, eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Or your reflection in the back of my camera.<eos> Thunderstorm?<eos> Probably what?<eos> Mature stage multicell cluster.<eos> It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Well, cats don't.
We know Harold was in on it, 'cause he's the one who bought the ink.<eos> And we know he didn't kill himself.<eos> Stuffed in a closet pretty much confirms that.<eos> What's he got going on in his mouth?<eos> Full set. 32 and counting.<eos> So, Harold gets done in his own trailer.<eos> Not likely he was snuck up on in there.<eos> The toothless accomplice.<eos> Where we gonna find him?<eos> Same place Calvin did.
Irritating me?<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> No, when I was a kid.<eos> Someone came into my life for a while, and I thought we were going to be best friends.<eos> But this girl lied to me, and I pushed her away because of that lie, and she asked me to forgive her, but I never did.<eos> It took some time, but I realized that was a mistake. And I regretted the decision, but by then, it was too late. The damage was already done.<eos> I don't wanna make the same mistake again, Regina.<eos> Living in Storybrooke, I've got my son and my parents, and I love them. But they can't always understand me.<eos> They don't know what it feels like to be rejected and misunderstood.<eos> Not the way I do. Not the way you do.
Let's revisit this in ten years.<eos> No, trust me, I will now.<eos> You know what?<eos> You probably would.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing, no... I don't know.<eos> I'm just saying that I'm sure Maia loves the fact that you bring her snack to school every single day... in a purple lunch box. Hey.<eos> She likes orange slices and provolone.<eos> And it has to stay cool.<eos> Of course it does.
- to the top of Machu Picchu.<eos> - That's walking, not camping.<eos> You two are seriously debating this right now?<eos> Sam's girlfriend, Louisa, told us Sam went alone back to Manhattan yesterday afternoon to get supplies.<eos> We know he never made it back to the island and was killed around midnight.<eos> Those kids couldn't have killed Sam.<eos> They couldn't even get off the island, 'cause Sam had their only boat.<eos> And you and Carrie believe their story?<eos> Jay's looking for the boat to confirm it,<eos> - but, yes, we do.
I'm not trying to hurt you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Louisa, I'm not like everyone else.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> No...<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> Because you and me, we're... we're a lot alike.<eos> Listen, I know what it's like to feel alone and different.<eos> I do.
Age twenty-six.<eos> Student.<eos> Believed to be accompanying Patient Zero to Mount Wilson regarding operation Bite Mark.<eos> Last contact seven days ago.<eos> Status, single.<eos> I mean, status unknown.<eos> What a tomato.<eos> What?<eos> No offense babe, but you need a bath.<eos> Do I?
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Well, they didn't kill themselves, I hope. No.<eos> There was a woman.<eos> She killed them.<eos> She was already there working for the resistance.<eos> She must be quite a woman. Oh, she is.<eos> So it was a bit of a mistake, you deciding to go to Portland.<eos> Rather obvious.<eos> I didn't choose Portland.<eos> Kelly did.
Hetty did not faint.<eos> Okay maybe she didn't faint.<eos> But Deeks is right.<eos> We don't know what's going on. I agree.<eos> We need to focus on what we do know.<eos> And what's in front of us right now.<eos> We don't have anything!<eos> What if we're wrong?<eos> And someone got to her while we're chasing our tails?<eos> Then we do what we do best.
Ms. Brewer?<eos> Didn't see that coming.<eos> How about the man who tried to save Chet Messner?<eos> I call on thee...<eos> The janitor's a witch?<eos> Why didn't you tell us that you and Chet Messner were part of a secret society?<eos> There you go. It's a secret.<eos> Yeah, but secret-time kind of goes away when it's a homicide.<eos> Our religion had nothing to do with what happened to Chet.<eos> Maybe it did.
They do not.<eos> They just have their own problems right now.<eos> Oh, yeah. The Creel business.<eos> In fact, perhaps they need our assistance if they're looking for a way to neutralize Creel's ability.<eos> No one has our experience with Gifteds.<eos> Of course, we can't just hijack the project from them.<eos> That would shatter their confidence.<eos> - Yeah, no. Do not wanna do that.<eos> - No.<eos> - Or do we?
Including Agent May.<eos> Not a smart move.<eos> She the type that holds a grudge?<eos> Savors it, actually.<eos> No doubt, you've made some mistakes.<eos> So have I. Like letting you go after Creel.<eos> But I felt for you.<eos> Yeah, and I took advantage of that.<eos> How do you know I won't do it again?<eos> I don't.
I don't blame him for the choices I've made.<eos> Right, I seem to remember you blaming your brother.<eos> Or was it your parents?<eos> Man, I can't keep up.<eos> My family tore me down.<eos> Garrett built me back up, the way he wanted.<eos> We're all aware of who your family is, Ward.<eos> Not only are they respected, they're pretty much loved.<eos> Well, every family has its secrets.<eos> Yours does, too.
Not long ago, you were a Level 5 S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.<eos> Yes, before S.H.I.E.L.D.'s fall.<eos> I was candid about my work history.<eos> You left things out.<eos> If I did, it wasn't intentional.<eos> Stop lying.<eos> You've been doing cellular analysis for Project Blizzard, yet didn't inform your supervisor that you knew the subject.<eos> I didn't realize it was Gill until yesterday. When I saw a photo in Kenneth's file.<eos> I would have said something...<eos> Yet you didn't.
She's good.<eos> She's not the only one.<eos> We should talk.<eos> First of all, I want you to know that I see your progress.<eos> You're an important part of this team.<eos> And I don't want you to forget that.<eos> But I saw the recording.<eos> Your conversation with Ward.<eos> You almost killed him.<eos> But I didn't.
I appreciate it.<eos> Happy to comply.<eos> Donnie's programing proved to be unstable.<eos> Ultimately, it held.<eos> One last thing.<eos> There's a scientist in our downstairs lab.<eos> I believe her talents are being wasted.<eos> I'd like authorization to bring her up here.<eos> So you trust her?<eos> I do now.
-On the, uh, animal attacks?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Wait, you're telling me the FBI has got nothing better to do?<eos> Well, we go where the boss tells us to.<eos> To what, arrest a bobcat from Hibbing?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No. No, there's no problem.<eos> You ain't the first feds to roll through here and come up with nothing.<eos> -Sure is cute to watch you try though.<eos> -Pal, the FBI doesn't do cute.
- Seriously?<eos> - Yes. Picture the locking mechanism in your mind.<eos> Excuse me, but can we train Ezra later?<eos> One last miracle here.<eos> Spectre-5 to Phantom.<eos> We're on the landing deck, ready for pickup.<eos> On my way. Spectre-5.<eos> And I'm bringing the fleet.<eos> We have a fleet?<eos> We do now.
The spirit would have no connection to this location.<eos> No! This house is on the ley line, just like all the other places of attack.<eos> Oh, come on, John.<eos> What are you missing?<eos> Henry is going to wake up any second.<eos> I'm afraid he's gonna go after my husband.<eos> We need to get this thing - out of him.<eos> - You do not want an exorcism, Clair.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do.
Suppose we go to my place when you're done here...<eos> And I kiss better the sore parts of those tattoos... One by one?<eos> And then... You show me the tattoos on parts of you I haven't seen...<eos> And you say, 'Look. It hurts here too'?<eos> Huh?<eos> - Do I have to answer now? - Do I...<eos> Take that as a yes?<eos> She's a fast mover, boss.<eos> Where did you find her?<eos> I didn't.
Now that takes the cake.<eos> Your husband's right to go off you.<eos> Who said he went off me?<eos> He turns his back on you in bed.<eos> That's what you told Aysel.<eos> Aysel!<eos> What? When did I say that?<eos> Aysel, you called last week and said Songül's not getting any.<eos> - Didn't you say the poor man's right? - She did.<eos> She did.
Is he looking?<eos> - No.<eos> Stop looking at Tayyar.<eos> He'll never marry you.<eos> He's a womanizing scumbag.<eos> Keep your eye on Cemil.<eos> I'm going up to him the second I get an inviting look.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> - He told me to come.<eos> - No, he didn't.
John?<eos> Say something, please.<eos> Wasn't your fault, mate.<eos> Should've never gotten you all involved.<eos> You, especially.<eos> Because I'm a coward.<eos> Because it's not your world.<eos> Never was and I knew it.<eos> And I knew you were high.<eos> We all did.
God's honest truth, I don't much care what happens now.<eos> Uh, he shouldn't have those.<eos> He's a former drug addict. Painkillers probably aren't a good idea, right, Adam?<eos> Guess you're just gonna have to tough it out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know you think that I'm some sort of monster, that I killed Daycia, but you're wrong.<eos> This was taken from a traffic cam about five blocks away from the house where Daycia's body was found.<eos> This is you, about to dump Daycia's body.<eos> You want to tell me again how you didn't kill her?<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, he's a huge rap star.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm a brother. I know who Boss Nova is.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, can you tell him I'm busy.<eos> - He's a client of yours?<eos> - Yeah. How come you never told me that?<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> Did he say what the problem was?<eos> No, but he never does.
What's the problem today?<eos> No problem.<eos> Just trying to get some work done.<eos> You don't know this, but a big part of my job is listening.<eos> You know, people like to tell you all kinds of crazy shit when they buy drugs; it makes them feel like it isn't just a purchase.<eos> Thank you, but... no thank you.<eos> You sure?<eos> I've got prime listening skills.<eos> You don't want to hear this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
In what?<eos> In... myself.<eos> In... (sighs) I just... I can't move forward.<eos> You know what I like to do when I'm stuck?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> It involves a lighter and a leafy green substance.<eos> No, but it does involve ear muffs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I wanted to punch that little girl's father right in the face.<eos> Yeah, I almost did.
Now, we are gonna walk out of here, and nobody's gonna stop us, you understand?<eos> You understand?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Go.<eos> Rush, come on!<eos> How's it look?<eos> Like you got hit with a gun.<eos> I don't know how to go in there.<eos> I really don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> We had an amazing day today.<eos> And she's someone I'd very much like to know.<eos> So, she came here looking for answers about her biological mother.<eos> You are her answer.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> Don't make her wait.<eos> I mean, Ellis made the decision for you.<eos> Don't do that to Pierce.
When it comes to family, you always place blame on yourself.<eos> - This is not your fault.<eos> - She's right, Oliver.<eos> Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's. Let the League sort this out.<eos> Merlyn has a video.<eos> - He made contingencies.<eos> - Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> During the undertaking, Merlyn told me that I couldn't win because I didn't know what I was fighting for.<eos> Now I do.
By League law, I have a right to challenge you to a trial by combat.<eos> It's been 67 years since someone challenged me.<eos> You covet death that much?<eos> Do you accept?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I see the years have done little to dull your stubbornness.<eos> - Maseo.<eos> - My name is Sarab.<eos> - You told me a man cannot live by two names.<eos> - And I don't.
- Starling General's at 8th and Wilcott.<eos> H.K.P.F. ID'd her as Sumilu Kang.<eos> She was a student at the University of Hong Kong.<eos> Biology textbook in her backpack.<eos> She was studying to become a veterinarian.<eos> He would have told me.<eos> I just needed more time.<eos> No, Mr. Queen, what you needed was conviction.<eos> The men who do things like this have it.<eos> You didn't.
One two three.<eos> Oh, screw you, Captain Boomerang.<eos> You think you've accomplished something here?<eos> You think you not killing me makes you strong?<eos> It just means you're weak.<eos> It means I have some humanity left.<eos> You just couldn't resist, could you?<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> You only call me sweetie when you want something.<eos> I do.
There is still time.<eos> All mouth and no trousers, this one.<eos> You feeling light-headed?<eos> I just nicked your brachial artery.<eos> You'll be dead in less than 90 seconds.<eos> I'm having trouble breathing.<eos> Yes, that would be your dying of hypovolemic shock.<eos> The sweating and chest pains are normal-- 70 seconds.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, bummer about the taxi strike.<eos> The SAC from the NCIS office is coming to take us to Heathrow.<eos> We have about... half hour.<eos> You want to head back to the hotel?<eos> Ducky?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I'm sorry, Eleanor.<eos> Uh, everything is, uh... as it must be.<eos> So how did you leave things with Maggie?<eos> I didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Now, about getting that phone number in writing.<eos> You're the detective, Tony.<eos> You know what "Tony" is spelled backwards?<eos> Why not?<eos> Think about it.<eos> You overheard that.<eos> Didn't have a choice.<eos> Gibbs would never leave you out of the loop on something like this.<eos> He didn't.
I didn't say that it did.<eos> But we have to look at you just like we would any other person of interest.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> This is the third time I've been a murder suspect.<eos> That makes me want to kill someone so you don't waste your time.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> I was joking.<eos> Do you want to see the evidence I found or what?<eos> Sure do.<eos> Yeah, we do.
We're gonna need to build a bigger church.<eos> Yeah, it's amazing.<eos> I hear there's one family come all the way from poughkeepsie. You...<eos> You think maybe we ought to slow down a little?<eos> Just try to... Figure out exactly what we got on our hands?<eos> It's not our place to question the gift. Where's my pen?<eos> I got a sermon to write.<eos> It's just... We don't know where it comes from. Sarah,<eos> I almost died.<eos> But I didn't.
Sold his soul.<eos> You don't seem surprised at the idea of Old Scratch bartering for souls.<eos> There's one thing I never understood is why he even wants our souls.<eos> The Devil used to be an angel.<eos> That's why he's called the "First of the Fallen."<eos> You ask a holy type, and they'll tell you... the soul is the purest expression of God's love.<eos> The spark of creation.<eos> Every time the First takes a soul, he's exacting revenge, paying back the Almighty for casting him out.<eos> I do want to hear you.<eos> I do.
But you know more than you've been telling me.<eos> They're called metahumans.<eos> Metahumans?<eos> People with very powerful abilities.<eos> You and me are the only guys on the force that know what's really going on.<eos> And we need to keep it that way so nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And the Flash?<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Miss Hughes, we haven't found any records of adoption for Jared.<eos> And you won't find any.<eos> Jared was dropped at my doorstep by a friend.<eos> She worked at a convent, a place where girls in trouble often went.<eos> So, you're saying that Jared's mother was one of these "girls in trouble"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know that Jared has a brother?<eos> A twin.<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
I found a vent.<eos> I saw light... daylight.<eos> And I just kept crawling forward, toward the light.<eos> I didn't care where it led-- Heaven, hell...<eos> I didn't care, I just kept going.<eos> I just kept going...<eos> I...<eos> I can't remember much more than that.<eos> No, that's good.<eos> You're-you're doing really good.
I won't let that happen.<eos> But you need to let me answer that now.<eos> Charlie-0-5-Sanders, talk to me! Charlie-0-5-Sanders!<eos> Are you there?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> CSI Finlay, I need you to surrender your firearm.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> Yes, you do.
Previously on Ascension...<eos> Your father was convinced that the US could launch an interstellar spacecraft, right then in the '60s, with the technology we had.<eos> Quite a dream Dad had.<eos> Lorelei!<eos> Last night, we lost one of our own in a tragic accident, Lorelei Wright.<eos> And I don't have any experience with anything like this.<eos> Nobody does.
I applied for an apprenticeship with you.<eos> It's a very competitive program.<eos> Oh, of course!<eos> It's an honour just to be considered.<eos> Still think this is not enough of a distraction?<eos> Emily wanted me to drop this off.<eos> They were Lorelei's.<eos> I didn't hear you come in last night.<eos> I slept on the beach.<eos> Everybody did.
Del.<eos> I'm feeling a little attacked here.<eos> Look, every answer will only get us closer to the truth.<eos> So, let's just answer honestly.<eos> Okay, Your Honor...<eos> Uh, Del, that is an improper question.<eos> It seems proper to me.<eos> Not for a layman, or a non-meteorologist.<eos> But Mr. Pratt must have an opinion.<eos> We all do.
Thank you.<eos> This has not been an easy decision.<eos> On the one hand, the defense has presented a reasonable alternate theory to Trey Wagner's disappearance, but they haven't backed it up with evidence.<eos> The prosecution, meanwhile, has a great deal of evidence, but nothing that leads one directly to the conclusion that they would like.<eos> I am left with a tie.<eos> So I've asked the defendant's pretrial services officer to weigh in, and I'd like her recommendation on the record.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> Do you have a recommendation for the court?<eos> I do.
Terence Reynolds.<eos> He came 3 hours ago on his own.<eos> Said she's the victim's partner.<eos> He was ashamed.<eos> That's why I ended our relationship.<eos> Who else knew Douglas was gay?<eos> Nobody.<eos> He was scared to death people would find out.<eos> So he didn't have a social life?<eos> He did.
I plan to give it to you.<eos> Along with my full protection.<eos> We'll rebuild this newspaper together.<eos> How incredibly generous.<eos> You accept my offer, then? No.<eos> I reject it absolutely.<eos> But I would like to thank you.<eos> For days, I've been feeling useless, futile.<eos> I was losing the sense that my profession even mattered, that my newspaper mattered.<eos> But obviously it does.
- May I join you?<eos> Amelia Shepherd, do you know Dr. Maggie Pierce?<eos> Weird, you're the second Dr. Shepherd I've met today.<eos> Derek is my brother. I'm sorry.<eos> Is everyone in this room somehow related?<eos> I'm gonna leave you two alone.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Meredith Grey has an adopted daughter.<eos> Uh, I know this.<eos> Well, I didn't.
Listen, I am... I'm surprised that you're surprised by this.<eos> I mean, it's a natural extension of what I already do.<eos> I'm surprised because it came out of the blue.<eos> No, I thought about it for awhile.<eos> I mean, I need something new.<eos> We're having another kid.<eos> That's not new?<eos> This is different.<eos> It has nothing to do with that.<eos> It does, though.
- We have a new number.<eos> I'm sending you the details now.<eos> I hope it's better than this one.<eos> My hero.<eos> HOE: And are personal calls allowed?<eos> No, they are not.<eos> Are there lots of temps who want this job if you don't?<eos> Why, yes, there are.<eos> Do I understand?<eos> Yes, I do.
H-has he been charged with anything?<eos> Because you turned our home upside down.<eos> I'd like to know exactly what you found.<eos> Mr. Bentley, this case is ongoing.<eos> But we can tell this... we found a pair of shoes in your garage that match the footprints from one of our crime scenes.<eos> Okay, well, this is ridiculous.<eos> We're gonna leave.<eos> We'll be back with a lawyer to get our son released.<eos> You all have no real evidence to charge him.<eos> Actually, we do.
I'm here to see mary.<eos> What did you find?<eos> I spoke with a castle page.<eos> Before lord voland joined his family In their chambers, he insisted on taking confession.<eos> I had to bribe a few altar boys, but I got the priest's name.<eos> Father lucien.<eos> Where do we find this priest?<eos> You look troubled, brother.<eos> I know you call nostradamus friend.<eos> I do.
Yeah, or it's real and he's telling the truth.<eos> We gotta dig into this.<eos> We gotta dig into this.<eos> Let's see if Detroit can corroborate.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> I've been thinking about your friend's situation.<eos> And?<eos> Maybe we can do a little quid pro quo.<eos> That is, if my welfare means anything to you.<eos> It doesn't.
Did you call Ms. Tascioni and Mrs. Florrick last night and say I had to cancel?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I got Ms. Tascioni's secretary.<eos> Fantasia.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> So, I could ask you to lunch?<eos> I only said that as an example.<eos> Is this case about me?<eos> Elsbeth, your client plagiarized their software - from another company.<eos> - They did not.
No gang rape?<eos> No.<eos> Strangely enough, not.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> 'Cause that would've been a turn-on.<eos> Is that baby lotion?<eos> It's not enough to show that the codes are similar.<eos> To prove economic espionage, they need to show that you knew the Chinese company was going to give it to the government.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I didn't.
Farrow McDaniel.<eos> Good thing I said no... they went belly up in '59.<eos> Well, if you'd said yes, maybe they'd still be around.<eos> Want more money.<eos> Howard, you know this isn't about money for somebody like you.<eos> Come on, it's about being in court.<eos> It's about the rush of cross-examination.<eos> Canning and David Lee, they won't let you argue in court.<eos> They don't believe in you.<eos> We do.
I'd never met Dr. Booth.<eos> So, have you worked for Mr. Agos on any of the Lemond Bishop cases?<eos> Yes, for Alicia Florrick and Diane Lockhart.<eos> So, I'm assuming that, uh... You have regular interaction with, uh, Mr. Bishop?<eos> Had.<eos> He's no longer a client. Oh.<eos> Uh... Well, what about Mr. Bishop's employees?<eos> Might you interact with them? Of his legitimate businesses, yes.<eos> You have an opinion... On whether Mr. Agos is fit for further bail release?<eos> I do.
You mental-head.<eos> Come here, okay, while we're on the topic,<eos> - just answer this question.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Marriage: why?<eos> Seriously, that's the question?<eos> "Marriage: why?"<eos> Because it shows that two people love each other,<eos> - and care about each other and...<eos> - No, it doesn't.

Help me.<eos> We don't have to go out like this.<eos> You better hope you never see me again.<eos> Wow.<eos> What a place, huh?<eos> A beautiful home... for a beautiful lady.<eos> Please tell me what you want.<eos> I guess there's no harm in the truth.<eos> See, your boyfriend... was supposed to kill a certain person for somebody.<eos> Only he didn't.
- How about you, Harvey?<eos> - Fine by me. Oh God.<eos> I envy you, boys.<eos> Having nothing to lose must be liberating.<eos> - Must feel pretty good. - Yes, it does.<eos> Suppose you did have something to lose.<eos> What would you do then?<eos> Suppose, for instance, I had a knife to Barbara Kean's throat right now.<eos> Would you still be so brave?<eos> You don't.
Quite an adventure!<eos> I'll be on my way.<eos> Such a waste, though.<eos> Gotham needs men like you, both of you.<eos> Strong men with principles.<eos> I wish I could make you see I'm not the enemy.<eos> The system is not the enemy.<eos> The enemy is anarchy.<eos> But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim?<eos> Yes, you did.
You know this is fabricated.<eos> Olivia pope had Harrison plant this.<eos> He paid a girl to say I beat her.<eos> It doesn't matter. She's lying. I never...<eos> - David.<eos> I thought you said Harrison Wright buried this.<eos> I thought he did.<eos> I don't know how anyone found it.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Someone did.
She totally pushed him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he slipped.<eos> I can't watch this anymore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me neither.<eos> And we're also told both witnesses...<eos> You think she pushed him?<eos> Park Services and... Ma'am.<eos> Well, did she?
More money than you've ever seen?<eos> Like I told Elizabeth North, I'll be ruling this case the same way I've ruled My entire career on the bench.<eos> By the law and with my conscience.<eos> There is no amount of money that would ever make me change the way I do my job.<eos> Then it's a good thing that I'm not here to offer you money.<eos> I have something better.<eos> 1992. Rock Creek Parkway.<eos> You slammed your Mercedes Coupe into a Dodge Caravan, killing a woman and her 7year-old daughter.<eos> Why'd you flee the scene?<eos> Anything to do with your $75 bar bill at Stetsons earlier that night?
You have no idea what it is to be a mother.<eos> I don't need to listen to this.<eos> Barbara.<eos> - Mom. - Barbara.<eos> Frederick.<eos> Barbara.<eos> Barbara, wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She didn't have any right to say what she said in there.<eos> Yes, she did.
Starting, most obviously, with the parents of children who died?<eos> Well, there's a list in there.<eos> But aside from them... no, not yet.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, I heard you had a knack for missing persons.<eos> You know, I've never been to London.<eos> Hear it's a lot like New York.<eos> I guess you guys don't get the same number of gun deaths over there as we do, huh?<eos> Not many countries do.
I remember reading about a Mrs. Coleman.<eos> And it's apparent here that you live alone.<eos> You can appreciate why we would want to speak with you in the light of Mr. Openshaw's murder.<eos> Lots of people hated him.<eos> It's true.<eos> But whoever killed him sent him a package.<eos> An envelope from this zip code.<eos> And that makes me the killer?<eos> It make you a person of interest.<eos> I didn't do it.
Earlier, you mentioned there had been a break-in at your building while you were away, but that no one reported anything stolen.<eos> See, I believe that's because the intruder planted things instead.<eos> After we left, you found a gun and other evidence hidden in your home.<eos> And faced with the discovery that you were being framed, you decided to go along with it.<eos> No.<eos> I killed Openshaw and his lawyer.<eos> Did you?<eos> So, who did you kill first?<eos> I don't have to talk to you.<eos> No, you don't.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Sorry. We're pretending to be on the phone.<eos> Tough spot.<eos> I was here last week trying to organize a cleanup for garbage island, and I couldn't even get a page of signatures.<eos> Really?<eos> I had to go inside and buy a second clipboard, I got so many signatures.<eos> You must really have a noble cause.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Believe me, please, Jesse.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting back on the files. Isn't that what you want?<eos> To get them to find me, to get me caught.<eos> No.<eos> Jesse, don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!
Believe me, please, Jesse.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting back on the files. Isn't that what you want?<eos> To get them to find me, to get me caught.<eos> No.<eos> Jesse, don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!<eos> I did. I did. I did.
Yeah...<eos> Words I'm never fond of hearing.<eos> Look, I know that this past year has been hard for you.<eos> It's been hard for all of us.<eos> But the thing is... we've never talked about it.<eos> Not once.<eos> We don't have to.<eos> See?<eos> That's the problem.<eos> We do.
I am here, David, how are you?<eos> Well I would just point... start by pointing to what Barack Obama himself said about those questions when he was running for the office that he now occupies.<eos> In December of 2007, he said, quote,<eos> "The president does not have the power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."<eos> So by Obama's own words, the president does not have the power that he is now exercising under the Constitution.<eos> And as far as why it matters, in... on August 1, 2007, when he laid out his reasons why he was running for office and why he thought it was so important to change the way we were doing things, he said, quote, "No more ignoring the law when it's inconvenient.<eos> That is not who we are.<eos> We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers..."<eos> You asked why I picked you.<eos> I didn't.

So, that's exactly what they did.<eos> And then they started taking the telecom data and expanded after that.<eos> I mean the one I knew was ATT, and that one provided 320 million records every day.<eos> That program was reauthorized every 45 days by what I call the "yes committee," which was Hayden and Tenet and the DOJ.<eos> The program was called Stellar Wind.<eos> So first I went to the House Intelligence Committee and the staff member that I personally knew there, and she then went to the chairman of the committee, Nancy Pelosi was the minority rep.<eos> They were all briefed into the program at the time, by the way, and all the other programs that were going on, including all these CIA programs. I wasn't alone in this.<eos> There were four others out of NSA, and we were all trying to work internally in the government over these years trying to get them to come around to being constitutionally acceptable and take it into the courts and have the courts' oversight of it too.<eos> So we, we naively kept thinking that could, uh, that could happen.<eos> And it never did.
in aggregate over a person's life.<eos> And metadata, in aggregate, is content.<eos> It tells a story about you which is made up of facts, but is not necessarily true.<eos> So for example, just because you were on the corner and all those data points point to it, it doesn't mean you committed the crime.<eos> So it's important to note that if someone has a perception of you having done a thing, it will now follow you for the rest of your life.<eos> So just keep in mind that what happens to you guys, for example, with fingerprints and retinal scans and photographs, that is what is going to happen to people in the future when they resist policy changes and when they try to protest in a totally constitutionally protected way.<eos> This is for you, Director Clapper, again on the surveillance front, and I hope we can do this in just a yes or no answer because I know Senator Feinstein wants to move on.<eos> So, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?<eos> No, sir.<eos> It does not?
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this,<eos> I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.<eos> And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.<eos> You only get one warning.<eos> Which is more than you get.<eos> I can't make any promises over who may or may not survive.<eos> You know, you were wrong before.<eos> That you needed leverage to get what you want?<eos> No, that I didn't have it.<eos> I do.
And snow.<eos> My, my. How intriguing.<eos> And such a rare gift.<eos> Why would you ever want to give it up?<eos> Perhaps I could interest you in lessons instead?<eos> No.<eos> I want to stop them.<eos> We heard that you were the greatest collector of magic in all the Land.<eos> You must have something that can help.<eos> Well, of course I do, dearie.
I know how you feel about the Graysons, how you've always felt.<eos> And now I know now what they did to you and your company.<eos> I wish could have been there for you, Nolan, the way you've always been there for me.<eos> Which is why, if you can, I would... I would like it if you came to the interview tonight.<eos> I need someone on my side in case I get cornered.<eos> Then I'll be there.<eos> I'm proud of you, Nolan.<eos> All your hard work... It's paid off in spades.<eos> I wouldn't have any of this if you hadn't believed in me way back when.<eos> But I did.
I know I do.<eos> All right, well, it's public knowledge that Mr. Clarke and entrepreneur Nolan Ross were business associates years ago.<eos> Mr. Ross, welcome.<eos> Uh, Nolan was like the son I never had.<eos> And I knew his first company would be a success, and it was.<eos> Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.<eos> An investment that paid off.<eos> I figured the profits would provide a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.<eos> She never got the money, did she, Nolan?<eos> Of course she did.

- I don't think we can. - Why?<eos> Not after what I discovered.<eos> The guy that Charlotte killed had this.<eos> I convinced her that he was just another Flight 197 fanatic.<eos> Yeah, but if he had been, he would have published this photo so the world could see that known-terrorist David Clarke was still alive.<eos> - Who was this guy? - I don't know.<eos> But he was obviously following him for quite some time. But why?<eos> What is the connection?<eos> Your field trip didn't provide any answers?<eos> Sure did.
So, go home, clear your head. You get back here and you take his ass down.<eos> This is why I hate social media.<eos> Once something is out there, you have no control.<eos> People can take a private moment and create their own context.<eos> I mean, we weren't even investigating the murder yet, and they made us look like we were bad cops.<eos> - Or worse, like we didn't care.<eos> - Come on, Beckett.<eos> It's the Internet.<eos> No one's gonna take that picture seriously.<eos> 1PP did.
This party is so lame.<eos> And Jenna's father abandoned me to go to some stupid Splenda Bowl. - Sugar.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Which leaves me here with Val who I love, but...<eos> Hi, Matty.<eos> Tamela, Jake, Jenna.<eos> Mom, what are you doing here?<eos> Ally invited me.<eos> I don't know why I'm here. I don't know anyone.<eos> Well, I do.
Because the pressure would have forced the sutures to pop, creating... the jagged edge.<eos> And one of the pieces of the exposed bone could have easily come in contact with the killer's hands.<eos> Are you looking for that microscopic nick on the edge of the sagittal suture?<eos> There's something in the wound.<eos> Something shiny.<eos> I'll give this to Dr. Hodgins for a detailed analysis.<eos> I guess you just officially handed me my ass, Dr. Brennan? Yes.<eos> As long as you are here,<eos> I guess I sort of asked for that, huh?<eos> Yes, you did.
I brought you into my family and I treated you like a son!<eos> And you betrayed me.<eos> - For which I suffered.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> When I order some fool killed, I expect him to stay that way.<eos> Your boss, Don Falcone, expressly said...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, he wants peace.<eos> He's the only reason why your ass is still alive.<eos> And if I were you, I would pray! ... for his good health.<eos> Oh, I do.
Pretty professional job.<eos> Kid didn't even trip the alarm.<eos> Kid?<eos> Boy or girl? Girl.<eos> Said to ask if you been down any sewers lately.<eos> Hey, Detective.<eos> Miss me?<eos> I enjoyed it.<eos> I enjoyed hurting him.<eos> Of course you did.
Digital files are easy, but I was worried about the backup.<eos> Any word from Root?<eos> It's going to be a long fight, but it must be won, at any cost.<eos> Where did you go last night?<eos> I don't like being followed.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Detective.<eos> You are heading down a dark path, and you'll wind up getting yourself killed.<eos> All these incidents,<eos> I think you enjoy shooting people.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't like being followed.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Detective.<eos> You are heading down a dark path, and you'll wind up getting yourself killed.<eos> All these incidents,<eos> I think you enjoy shooting people.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I hate it.<eos> But it's what I'm good at, and it's what I have to do.<eos> You don't have to save everyone.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm Tom Tucker.<eos> Tragedy stuck Haiti today as the island nation was rocked by a major earthquake, leaving thousands dead and injured.<eos> Coming up, local newsman shows a camera operator how to center a shot.<eos> There we go.<eos> There, there's Tom.<eos> There's the star.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's terrible about Haiti.<eos> We got to do something to help.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I just, um...<eos> I didn't feel a connection.<eos> Thought we had a great time.<eos> It was fun.<eos> Just, uh, no sparks for me anyway.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Well, how do you know for sure?<eos> How about we go inside and see what happens, huh?<eos> I don't...
I don't know.<eos> It could explain the song, a nostalgic ploy.<eos> It's so cliched.<eos> I told you.<eos> We love our cliches here.<eos> They even come with a soundtrack.<eos> But Roberta Flack?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your life has a soundtrack, Ben.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Just stop him.<eos> We need evidence to do that, and we don't have it yet.<eos> He killed my dog.<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Isn't that enough evidence?<eos> There's nothing to link him to those two incidences, but if there is evidence to be found, we will find it, Andrea.<eos> Hey, Jack, got a minute?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't.
Let's go around back.<eos> I'm gonna untie you now, and then you're gonna stand up and walk towards me. Please.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> It'll all be over in a moment.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Kenneth's in jail.<eos> I'll kill her.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
We need to figure out who did this.<eos> Information about the writer of a magical book.<eos> I might just have an idea.<eos> Excellent.<eos> But I'm gonna need me lunch and dinner back.<eos> See, you ain't been in this town as long as I have.<eos> There wasn't always magic, but when it came, it started at one place -- the clock tower.<eos> See, for 28 years, them hands didn't move.<eos> Time stood still.<eos> Then one day, tick-tock, it bloody did.
You don't know her.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.<eos> We're a lot alike.<eos> We had families, but we both grew up in this palace, isolated and alone.<eos> I liked to go to the library and bury myself in a good book.<eos> My favorite was an ancient Norse legend -<eos> - The Trolden Glass.<eos> Perhaps you read it.<eos> Of course I did.
And while I was cleaning the bones, I noticed crushing injuries to the thyroid cartilages which indicate the use of a broad surface in the attempted strangulation.<eos> Which is a submission move typically used by people in the military.<eos> Booth was right.<eos> This was a trained killer.<eos> I found cause of death.<eos> You can see from Sweets' heart.<eos> The aorta was torn.<eos> Which happened when the killer struck his chest, causing inward fracturing of ribs three through eight on the left side.<eos> I just wish that we'd never uncovered this whole conspiracy.<eos> But we did.
Yet.<eos> Look... you gonna throw me off this case again?<eos> No.<eos> You do what you have to.<eos> You don't even need to send me reports.<eos> And I'm sorry about Sweets.<eos> I wish to hell I could turn back the clock.<eos> Wow, no reports.<eos> Never heard of that happening.<eos> It doesn't.
A slow and painful death.<eos> It's exactly what he deserved.<eos> I've been comparing injuries on Lance to those on the X-rays of the assailant.<eos> Fractures to Lance's fourth and fifth metacarpals...<eos> - Boxer fractures.<eos> - Yes.<eos> They correspond to the microfractures on the assailant's temporal bone.<eos> Wait, excuse me.<eos> The trajectory of the bullet that you tracked, Dr. Saroyan... it... it shouldn't have hit that artery.<eos> It didn't.
Hey. You.<eos> Just kill someone outside your office, you mop up the blood and what do you do?<eos> You just go back to work, right?<eos> I am sorry about your colleague, but I have a business to run.<eos> Right, and I have a case to solve.<eos> We're done.<eos> No, we're not done.<eos> I want to know what were in those documents that Sweets had that were so important that you had to take his life.<eos> Do I have to call your boss again?<eos> Please, do.
Stuck in traffic?<eos> I've been here. All right, let's go.<eos> So you failed to mention that Noah broke up with you because of Chloe.<eos> I don't see why that's relevant.<eos> You suspected Robertson was behind it.<eos> You see, Robertson, he's a control freak. So what do you do?<eos> You confronted him and, what, he humiliated you, right? Made fun of you.<eos> And that's when you snapped.<eos> Which is why you killed him.<eos> No, I didn't.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.<eos> Well, then, she doesn't know you, or she would stay.<eos> Now, you have to go talk to her.<eos> I think I'm too late.<eos> No such thing.<eos> I wish I could go back.<eos> I'd do everything so differently.<eos> We would've had a wonderful life together, Ellis.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - I do.
No, we find a way to help him that's less stupid!<eos> Okay, I'm gonna grab lunch.<eos> Hunt, find me later.<eos> What's going on?<eos> It's just I keep giving and giving and giving.<eos> You're giving me things I didn't ask for, Callie.<eos> That is not true!<eos> All I've done is everything that you've asked me to do.<eos> You asked me to not leave you after the plane crash.<eos> I didn't.
We have to ask ourselves... can this body be put back together?<eos> We were able to put Lee's esophagus back together, and I assure you, it's stronger than ever.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> If we've done our jobs right, it can.<eos> We stop the bleeding.<eos> We sew up the damage.<eos> We make the body whole again.<eos> I understand why we did this.<eos> You know, it was to make us stronger, to make us better.<eos> And it did.
I'm gonna keep it short 'cause I got a tee-time in 10 minutes.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Kind of funny.<eos> My dad died 25 years ago today.<eos> Ew!<eos> Right on the cake.<eos> I know.<eos> Keep watching. ...Nice to replace that sad memory with this happy one.<eos> Don't tell me uncle mitch drinks it.<eos> Of course he does...
Thank you.<eos> So, okay, any idea what happened to the victim?<eos> Uh, saw some drag marks up by the road.<eos> Come on, I'll show you.<eos> I imagine the goats trampled the remains.<eos> That they did.<eos> And quite well.<eos> Second generation pupal stage blowflies set time of death six to seven days ago.<eos> There is a significant amount of predation, as well as fracturing, not all it caused by the goats.<eos> Well, no, but they did a number on the clothing.
And abrasion on the inferior margin of the mandible.<eos> I cast a mold of the abrasion so we can match it to the other and hopefully get a murder weapon.<eos> Excellent work as usual, Mr. Vaziri.<eos> The marks appear to be serrations.<eos> It has to be some kind of knife.<eos> I disagree!<eos> The striations are too broad for a knife.<eos> But based on the location and directionality, the wound would've severed the carotid artery.<eos> So, we found cause of death?<eos> Yes. You did.
Well, how did the...?<eos> It's okay. I don't need to know.<eos> Wouldn't dream of holding you up.<eos> Booth? Booth?<eos> Found the murder weapon.<eos> It was a cuticle pusher.<eos> Oh, like, for nails?<eos> Yes.<eos> I-I don't know if this helps with Sandra Zins, but...<eos> No, it doesn't.
Nothing serious.<eos> Why, writer boy?<eos> What, you think you have a chance with her?<eos> And what are you doing, telling crazy over here about everyone's private life?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You told him about Lanie and me.<eos> - No...<eos> - No.<eos> - No, no, no, I didn't!
I'll find out whatever I can about those weapons.<eos> Coulson. Quick question.<eos> No. This wasn't us.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Uh, great.<eos> Um, May said I'll be going on a mission with Bobbi?<eos> Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> Did she say it was gonna be a problem?<eos> I won't dignify that with a response.<eos> So, she didn't?
It's over.<eos> For real, this time.<eos> (Long sigh)<eos> Ah...<eos> I had a feeling you might say that.<eos> Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us.<eos> - What?<eos> - My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies.<eos> Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.<eos> - No, he really does.
Okay, so then what happened?<eos> (Stammers) I'm not sure.<eos> What? (Stammers) I don't remember anything from last night.<eos> Yeah, that's not a good explanation.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> Oh, you know, the usual.<eos> Had a couple drinks, came back here.<eos> D-did we, uh, did we have sex?<eos> Come on, yeah.<eos> Of course we did.
You believe in that, don't you, miss Pope?<eos> I do.<eos> I want the truth to come out.<eos> Then I better get to work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, both.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just trying to remember who said it...<eos> That thing about the truth and the sun.<eos> I did.
I strengthened the military.<eos> I pushed the tax code through.<eos> I negotiated - the baltic peace accords.<eos> Brezhnev wouldn't budge because he knew Havel was already halfway to disintegrating communist rule.<eos> But I knew if we could just get everyone in the same room together,<eos> I'd talk Coop through it, step by step.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> No one ever...<eos> You think those boys would ever admit that they were being bossed around by a tri delt from tuscaloosa for eight years?<eos> - I did all of it.
Perfectly said.<eos> You don't fear Whitehall.<eos> You fear disappointing him.<eos> And let me tell you, he is going to be very disappointed to see that you gave him up.<eos> I didn't give up anything.<eos> No,<eos> You gave us everything.<eos> Whitehall's name, his Nazi adventures with Red Skull, his age.<eos> Did you know he's hypertensive?<eos> We do.
So, this is a question of first impression.<eos> Is cultural relativism a bar to a claim of sexual discrimination, or is it tantamount to an admission that should end these... proceedings?<eos> Miss Tascioni, is there a problem?<eos> What?<eos> No, Judge. - I...<eos> I'm being stalked.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> That man in the gallery over there, Josh Perotti... he's a stalker.<eos> Sir, if you don't have any business in my courtroom...<eos> Actually, Your Honor, I do.
And, girl, uh, you ain't got a cycle... you got a roller coaster.<eos> - Don't I know it, girl? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Duquan Feldman?<eos> I'm gonna make a note to call the Boys Girls Club.<eos> - No!<eos> - Why not?<eos> Uh, because he's coming here.<eos> Why would... why would Duquan come-come here?<eos> Because he comes here every Saturday.<eos> - He does?
- Hey.<eos> - Oh, hey. - I saved you a seat.<eos> - Oh! No. I've been offered a seat at the higher-ups' table.<eos> The tastemakers.<eos> - You're not invited.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> You're back to avoiding me.<eos> I'm not av...<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Um... he's got a nice penis.<eos> You're sweating a lot.<eos> That's what he said! Am I right?<eos> I'm a sweaty lover, is what he says to me.<eos> Okay, you know, you really don't seem gay. I don't buy it.<eos> Not now.<eos> Probably wondering why I didn't come home last night.<eos> Just needed some space to process this whole thing.<eos> I'm sorry if our room felt empty.<eos> Well, it did.
Welcome to prison.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> You just tell me how you hacked into NASA, and I promise everything will be okay.<eos> Should Happy and Paige be here?<eos> They're talking to you.<eos> Sergey Antonovich and Roman Volkovsky's cell.<eos> Russian outfit.<eos> Both doing a dime for identity theft.<eos> Well, clearly scumbags, but they don't seem to have the technical acumen to break out of this place.<eos> This one does.
Let me flip this one, put him to good use.<eos> We have plenty of KGB agents working for us already.<eos> But, sir...<eos> You've done well, Greer, but trust me, we need to erase the problem of Oleg Luski before anyone in his firm discovers he's a mole.<eos> Understood.<eos> Take a colleague.<eos> Luski's a dangerous man.<eos> And, Greer...<eos> This operation doesn't exist.<eos> They never do, sir.
Berlin killed meera.<eos> He nearly killed cooper.<eos> He put tom into my life.<eos> So if you're asking if I'm okay with a lethal outcome,<eos> Damn right I am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you hadn't told me you'd killed tom,<eos> I might think he was your source.<eos> But I did kill him.<eos> Of course you did.
Afraid I'll steal your crown?<eos> You were the one that was almost roasted on a spit.<eos> At least you got family on your case.<eos> I got a second-stringer, calling me senile.<eos> Nobody called you that.<eos> Okay, "dinosaur."<eos> Oh, cut it out.<eos> You cut it out.<eos> We do have something in common here, Pop.<eos> We do?
Where the hell does this guy get all this power?<eos> Some he grabbed, some he earned.<eos> Some we gave him and his like over the years, on a silver platter.<eos> Danny, think. Is there anything I need to know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I might have told the guy to get your hands against the wall, or I'll throw you out the window.<eos> Just mouthing off?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anybody hear you?<eos> He did.
I liked the street view, not the one from high up in headquarters.<eos> So... I understand.<eos> Well, what changed your mind?<eos> A man I trusted and admired gave me a four-word answer to my question then, to your question now:<eos> Why me?<eos> How am I in any way qualified?<eos> What he said?<eos> "You're a cop's cop."<eos> Well... nobody calls me that.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I cut class.<eos> I ran away from my secret service goons.<eos> I helped some girl I barely knew Jack her father's private jet to go to a party.<eos> I got drunk.<eos> I smoked weed.<eos> I-I shot up something awesome.<eos> And yet the only way that you think that I could have sex with two guys is if I were raped?<eos> How lame are you?<eos> What... What they did to me?<eos> What about what I did to them?
What was that assignment, Agent Larsen?<eos> Allow me to jog your memory.<eos> Multiple security cameras and several prints place you in the defense research facility for more than an hour, a highly classified area, as you might guess, where many lethal agents are studied and housed, including one specific strain of bacterial meningitis<eos> that went missing that day, the exact strain that killed young Jerry grant 48 hours after you visited the facility.<eos> What is he doing, Mr. President?<eos> Finding out who killed my son, Cyrus.<eos> Tom: What do you want from me?<eos> Rowan:<eos> You know what I want, soldier. I don't, I swear.<eos> Oh, but you do.
But I feel compelled to tell you that other firefighters have gone down this road, only to find themselves chasing ghosts.<eos> Yeah, I know what you're talking about, Chief.<eos> I know you've always felt that firefighting is your legacy.<eos> What I need right now is a great paramedic.<eos> Then you have one.<eos> I'm here to do the work.<eos> Good.<eos> Chief, did Lieutenant Severide mention my situation?<eos> He... he said that he was gonna do what he could to try and find a way around the situation, keep me on the Squad.<eos> No, he did not.
We -- we know you've been stressed out at school, so daddy and I went down there today, and we got you into...<eos> Miss Sparrow's class!<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were setting me up.<eos> But I want to stay with Mrs. Plank.<eos> But why?<eos> Miss - - Miss Sparrow's so fun and creative.<eos> Yeah, today, she gave us yarn, and we did whatever we wanted.<eos> I don't want to play with yarn. I want to read and learn math.<eos> We do math. Really?
It's gone, and so is Elsa and my aunt!<eos> But I saw you with it.<eos> Well, now it's missing, and Elsa is in it.<eos> I just have to get her out, let her know I didn't mean it.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's straw.<eos> Gold straw.<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> Kristoff... My aunt doesn't have the urn.<eos> He does.
That was Belle over at the diner.<eos> It turns out they can possibly make the counterspell even if we don't find Anna.<eos> They can pull the mirror dust out of the necklace - and try to use that.<eos> - It's exactly the same?<eos> Almost. It'll take a little longer.<eos> The process is difficult and... It will destroy the necklace.<eos> So the necklace can either save all of us or Anna.<eos> No. It can do both.<eos> We have time.<eos> We don't.
- And go where? We'll sneak down the back stairs. We'll run around to the front porch and pretend we cut our trip short to be with everybody.<eos> Now, you grab your coat, get the diaper bag.<eos> I'll grab a couple of suitcases, and I'll meet you there.<eos> Hey, sweetie, what are you reading?<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> Well, I think it's Dolce Gabbana.<eos> She asked "what," not "who." Do you see Red Carpet?<eos> Well, we're just wearing dresses over our boy clothes, like you.<eos> No, I forgot. Us wearing dresses upsets you, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, it does.
So, what you're saying to me is that you killed Meachum, but you didn't kill Tyler.<eos> Yes.<eos> We did hit that boy that night.<eos> I wish we didn't. But we did.<eos> But I didn't hurt Tyler.<eos> I could never do that.<eos> Do you believe her?<eos> I believe she loved Tyler.<eos> Doesn't mean she didn't kill him.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- Really?<eos> You sounded pretty upset on the phone.<eos> - I was, but you know...<eos> - I've taken care of everything. I've already reserved the u-haul, and I can start packing your things up right away.<eos> Harrison, I haven't decided to leave.<eos> Someone broke into your apartment.<eos> They almost attacked you.<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> You can't handle this kind of life.<eos> But I did.
There's nothing you can do.<eos> I killed him.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did, Liv.<eos> Everything we've tried to do to keep me from this, and all it took was one guy running out into the road.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Liv, stop, stop!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> You didn't kill him, Tyler.<eos> I did.
Yeah, this is where he held me.<eos> And that room back there is where he shot the guy.<eos> What...?<eos> What... I don't know who this man is, but he's clearly deranged.<eos> I've never seen him before in my life.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Bring in the crime-lab guys, tear this place apart.<eos> There's got to be evidence here.<eos> Presume you have a search warrant.<eos> Hell, yeah, we do.
I don't remember.<eos> That's okay. What's the last thing that you do remember?<eos> Mommy and Daddy.<eos> They were fighting.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I want my mommy.<eos> I know.<eos> Of course you do.
Maybe it's time to put that on the table.<eos> You can't reward this kind of action...<eos> No. It's not a reward if you also stipulate they have to allow inspectors. To make sure that that thing is turned off when they say it's turned off.<eos> Something the Iranians have refused to do up until now.<eos> Carrot and stick.<eos> I like it.<eos> Do you think you could make that work, Allen?<eos> Well, I can try, sir.<eos> If you both think it will work.<eos> I do.
My faith.<eos> They wanted me to renounce god.<eos> But I said no.<eos> I said no, I swear I did, And I ran and I ran...<eos> Did you ever see them again? No.<eos> But there's others tell the same story.<eos> The same mark.<eos> The same price.<eos> They wanted my soul, But I wouldn't give it them.<eos> But what if others did?
If that's true, then you found the boy hurt already and made up some story about how he was wounded, or...<eos> Or they crushed the poor stable boy's skull themselves.<eos> - To save their own.<eos> - That ain't true.<eos> Shut up, Jerome.<eos> They can't prove anything.<eos> Oh. Yes we can.<eos> I've sent for a man from the village Marc actually came from.<eos> When he gets here, we'll know if my nephew threw that rock.<eos> If he didn't...
Admit it.<eos> Admit you wanted me dead.<eos> Is that why you did it?<eos> Is that why you killed me?<eos> Yes. It nearly destroyed me to kill my own father, but you left me no choice.<eos> - Narcisse.<eos> - You were behaving so strangely outside.<eos> You seemed so upset.<eos> I wish that I hadn't seen or heard this moment.<eos> But I did.
Hold this.<eos> With the grain, back and forth.<eos> Smooth, always with the grain.<eos> You think this will help?<eos> Helps me.<eos> Keep sanding.<eos> I've been at the Fairfax County prosecutor's office all evening.<eos> I didn't want to tell you until I was sure it was official.<eos> We have a deal?<eos> We do.
Can't we just believe them?<eos> What, are you high?<eos> We're infected already, remember?<eos> What is this place?<eos> This isn't a hospital.<eos> It's a goddamn hall of horrors.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I hope God doesn't know about this.<eos> 'Cause if He does...
Face it, you failed at people's safety net job.<eos> Oh, come on, guys.<eos> Give me a break, huh?<eos> I've had a rough day.<eos> You've had a rough day?<eos> You guys wouldn't believe the day I've had.<eos> First of all, I didn't have any clean underwear this morning, so I had to wear a bathing suit.<eos> Then I missed the bus, of course.<eos> Then it looked like it was gonna start to rain.<eos> Luckily, it didn't.
Maybe you should take him with you.<eos> You'd miss him if he was gone.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Let me buy you a drink sometime.<eos> Soon.<eos> Your security still sucks.<eos> No one's hunting for me.<eos> I didn't expect to see you again.<eos> Never said goodbye.<eos> No, we didn't.
You... You need it more than I do.<eos> Nah. Let's keep things honest between us.<eos> Uh, I'm keeping this one anyway.<eos> Having a little chat, Master Bruce?<eos> Thinking out loud.<eos> Right.<eos> Right. Of course you were.<eos> Shall I take that for you?<eos> The old house seems very quiet... without her, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Hey. Watch out. Watch out.<eos> Coming through. Coming through.<eos> Hey, hey, take it easy with that.<eos> I made that for Coulson.<eos> Wow. Hey, you know, if you're looking for vacation time, bribery will get you nowhere.<eos> 'Cause I've...<eos> I've tried. No, I'm hoping he'll let me work on the real thing.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> And, um, so how do you get it to fly?<eos> - It doesn't. - Oh.
It's alien. While Simmons and I were undercover at HYDRA, Whitehall was looking to create an extinction-level event.<eos> To kill millions of people. We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that.<eos> Because bad guys love their WMDs.<eos> Trick is, to activate the Obelisk, HYDRA has to take it to a specific place.<eos> It's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead...<eos> Now, they need the lock. A temple inside the city.<eos> Any idea where this temple is?<eos> Glad you asked. No.<eos> But it's in the city, and we now know where that is.<eos> Even better, HYDRA doesn't.
ESPOSITO: So while you and Castle were busy getting lap dances,<eos> Ryan and I did some real police work and found a Carlucci connection to the murder.<eos> Yeah, wait. What kind of a connection?<eos> Well, turns out the family's number two, Christopher Carlucci, owns a black Mustang.<eos> Guess what was stashed inside?<eos> A Santa suit.<eos> With blood on it.<eos> Christopher Carlucci, we need to talk.<eos> Why did you kill Eric Mercer?<eos> I didn't.
Eric hated Luca.<eos> We all do.<eos> For what he did to Jane.<eos> Dino's daughter?<eos> How is she involved?<eos> One night, she's at this club.<eos> Luca was there, and he tried to have his way with her.<eos> Word got back to Dino.<eos> He was ready to kill Luca, wanted to pull the trigger himself.<eos> And did he?
Yo. Jane's alibi checks out.<eos> Doorman places her at home during Eric's murder.<eos> What about the street cams in the area around Luca Tessaro's shooting?<eos> We looked.<eos> There's no cameras out that way.<eos> Ugh. Which means we're dead in the water.<eos> Which means I could be dead in the water.<eos> If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric, we need to figure out who it was.<eos> Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too, they're not gonna talk.<eos> Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) Okay, and... (BEEPING)<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> That's not even a clever alias.<eos> You know, this guy might be using that alias to withdraw his cash, but I bet he created the account remotely.<eos> You think you can trace the account back to the computer it originated from?<eos> I think you should tell Christopher he's sleeping over New Year's Eve, too.<eos> Rita determined Il Penumbra's Cayman account was opened using a server at the Midtown Library branch.<eos> Public terminal. Makes sense.<eos> Especially since most libraries don't have security cameras.<eos> But the convenience store across the street from this one does.
WE'LL BE FINE!<eos> JUST GO!<eos> I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU! I LOVE YOU!<eos> - ZAOFU IS OURS!<eos> BRING THE CITIZENS OF ZAOFU TO KNEEL BEFORE THE GREAT UNITER.<eos> ALL WHO PLEDGE THEIR LOYALTY TO ME WILL KEEP THEIR FREEDOM AND BE DEALT WITH FAIRLY AS FULL CITIZENS OF THE EARTH EMPIRE.<eos> THE REST WILL BE IMPRISONED AS TRAITORS, LIKE SU BEIFONG AND HER SONS.<eos> NOW BOW.<eos> BOW TO HER!<eos> DO IT!
Is there something you can share?<eos> We're trying to find a connection between the attackers and the man who murdered your ex-husband.<eos> You caught Conrad's killer? Yeah.<eos> His name was Vince Walsh.<eos> Was?<eos> You mean he's dead?<eos> We found him with the murder weapon.<eos> He was the same one who tried to run down David a few weeks ago.<eos> I'm surprised David didn't mention this to you.<eos> No, he didn't.
Nobody's business but her own and whoever she chooses to share it with. All right.<eos> Danny finds out I knew and didn't tell him, I'm sending him after you.<eos> Well, if you ask me, who cares if they want to put on a few extra security guards?<eos> Not a few. 500.<eos> Are they paying for 'em?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Then it's nobody's business if they do.<eos> The Times ad sends a message that they had to pick up my slack.<eos> It doesn't say that, Dad.<eos> For all intents and purposes, it does.
Judge Kleiner served on the board of three hospitals as an expert in medical malpractice cases.<eos> His parents were both doctors.<eos> It was a legacy close to his heart.<eos> Right.<eos> So what we're looking for is a single case where all three victims put their left hand on the Bible, put their right hand up in the air, stated their name and testified under oath.<eos> So let's get started.<eos> The police are doing a big push to locate your brother.<eos> I hope they find him.<eos> But what I'm asking of you does not hinge on their success.<eos> It sure does.
Yes.<eos> Detective Reagan.<eos> You shoot him? Yes.<eos> He called my name, I turned.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> I pulled out my gun and shot and missed.<eos> He kept going and turned to shoot.<eos> But I shot him first.<eos> You got a permit for the gun?<eos> Yes, I do.
There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.<eos> And if we want to help Javi out, then the best thing that we can do is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this, and some of those answers might be at his apartment.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check it out and let you know.<eos> Kate, is it true... what they're saying?<eos> Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this, and we're gonna get him out of there, I promise you.<eos> Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish, we've got eyes on Esposito.<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.<eos> They don't.
It's about how Israeli settlements in the West Bank - violate the Geneva Convention.<eos> - Really? - It'll kill him with Jewish voters.<eos> - And evangelical Christians.<eos> No.<eos> No, he's right. The evangelicals will be turned off, too.<eos> - No, we're not using this.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because we don't even know if he still believes this.<eos> - What does that matter?<eos> - Because it does.
Well, I'm sorry about that.<eos> I'm sorry that you don't even have memories.<eos> So where are we gonna hide?<eos> Come on, think about it.<eos> You need a place where you're safe and you can come up with a plan.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ok.<eos> Look, I have a buddy who has a cabin in the mountains not far from Park City.<eos> Your buddy has a cabin?<eos> His parents do.
Maybe Helen had a green thumb after all.<eos> Why are they keeping us here like caged animals?<eos> I think it's for our own safety.<eos> They think one of us killed Helen.<eos> I thought Helen killed herself.<eos> Helen?<eos> She used to catch spiders in the kitchen and let them go outside.<eos> She wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> Did any of you know her well?<eos> I did.
I want my lawyer.<eos> (chuckles) Don't ask us-- ask them.<eos> You're in their custody now.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're the ones who will find out what you actually know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Where am I going? Where are they taking me?<eos> We don't know.<eos> No one does.
Ye of little faith.<eos> Tomorrow night, when the stars in the sky align with the stars in the hat, I shall finally cleave myself from this dagger and be on the other side of that ice wall before dawn.<eos> Are you saying there's a bloody way out of here?<eos> Dark One always finds a way.<eos> Well, if the Dark One is so powerful, why doesn't he magic his grandson to his side?<eos> Because that would require me knowing where his mothers have locked him away for safekeeping.<eos> Now unless you really, really have no need for that tongue, I suggest you slither back outside into the hostile current and find Henry.<eos> You'll be needing this.<eos> You won't win.<eos> Villains never do.
Your sister?<eos> She's mine.<eos> And whatever you're gonna do? Well... Don't.<eos> Elsa, I found this on the beach.<eos> It's from our mother.<eos> She must've thrown it into the ocean before their ship sank.<eos> It came over in the portal with us.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> No, I'm not gonna be careful. She needs to hear this.<eos> You all do.
Her Instagram was just deactivated.<eos> Same with the Twitter account.<eos> She just deleted all her remaining online accounts.<eos> Well, that's all right.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Nobody gets away from Double P, baby.<eos> Double P?<eos> Yeah, that's my nickname.<eos> Nobody calls you that.<eos> I do.
The man who lived here was murdered.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> That's a lot more interesting than mall walking.<eos> Anybody notice anything unusual going on in the past few weeks?<eos> When wasn't there something unusual going on?<eos> For years, I'd hear screams almost every night.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> I heard it when I visited.<eos> And you never thought to report it?<eos> We did.
When he dropped out of school.<eos> And this is after Fairbanks experimented on him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Seems like once the evil genie is out of the bottle, it's tough to get him back in.<eos> Which explains Alex's e-mail to Professor Fairbanks.<eos> "Until your experiment, I never knew what a monster I truly was.<eos> What you've unleashed, it's your fault."<eos> Why am I here?<eos> You have no reason to bring me in.<eos> But we do,
It's okay.<eos> It's exciting how much we have to discover about each other, isn't it?<eos> Wow! What?<eos> Nothing, I just...<eos> No, I just meant, like, you and I feels right, doesn't it?<eos> I mean, it feels like we've known each other forever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't feel right to you?<eos> It sure seemed like it did.<eos> No. Sure it does.
[ Voice breaking ] AND THEY SAID SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS.<eos> THAT'S WHY WE TOLD YOU NOT TO GET CLOSE TO THE STUDENTS!<eos> FIRST, I REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T MEET MARK SPITZ, AND NOW AN "I TOLD YOU SO"?<eos> I'M SORRY.<eos> YOU'RE RIGHT.<eos> WE DON'T SINGLE PEOPLE OUT FOR BLAME AROUND HERE.<eos> IN FACT, WE'RE GONNA GO OUT THERE AND SHOW EVERYBODY THAT WE STAND TOGETHER ON THIS.<eos> THANK YOU.<eos> I APOLOGIZE FOR CALLING YOUR ENTIRE UNIT UNPROFESSIONAL.<eos> YOU DID?
Brother.<eos> I will, brother.<eos> All right. Talk to you later, brother.<eos> See you, brother.<eos> Bye, brother.<eos> Okay, I have finished my last will and testament.<eos> To Rosa, I leave you nothing.<eos> Pass.<eos> You can't pass on me leaving you nothing.<eos> Just did.
Your father do this to you?<eos> I want to go home.<eos> And you can.<eos> As soon as I can talk to the person who knows where Denise Murdock is.<eos> I told you, I don't...<eos> I know what you told me, but there is a girl out there dying... somewhere.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm your friend, okay?<eos> You got to talk to me.<eos> And if I don't?
Do you know what I mean?<eos> So you get the best bass player, you get the best drummer, you get the best singer, and you get the best song.<eos> And that... It's all about product, you know?<eos> What you get is an industry, a system with rules.<eos> And when you have those things, you always have people that are ready to break them... or work around them.<eos> Before Whitney sang the song, there's this story that I tell about when Elvis was planning to record "I Will Always Love You."<eos> And he had it all worked up and I told everybody that he was recording' it and they'd invited me down to the studio.<eos> And so the night before, Colonel Tom had called and said, "Now, you know that Elvis don't do anything that we don't have the publishing' or at least half the publishing' on."<eos> I said, "Well, I can't do that, because that's my most important copyright in my publishing company."<eos> Elvis didn't do the song.
I just don't like sitting around doing nothing.<eos> Well, there's something that you can do.<eos> LAPD has been investigating Chad, but there's still a lot we don't know about him, his group, how they operate.<eos> You could help us put Chad away for a very long time.<eos> Look. I do that, I'm marked for life, not just by Chad but by every skinhead out there.<eos> You created this problem.<eos> There's something that you can do about it.<eos> You think I deserve this.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
I'm fine.<eos> Tell me, how'd you get into this life?<eos> Mark was very persuasive.<eos> He showed a kid who got his ass kicked every other day what real power was.<eos> Shaped me into the man I am today.<eos> Seems to me like you still respect him, like you still want him a part of your gang.<eos> I never turn my back on family.<eos> His blood is my blood.<eos> Then why'd you try to kill him?<eos> I didn't.
They say life doesn't give you second chances.<eos> But we do.
They say life doesn't give you second chances.<eos> But we do.<eos> Surgeons do.
- Other shoe.<eos> - We got this.<eos> Go.<eos> - Close for me.<eos> Did Owen talk to you?<eos> I didn't tell him anything.<eos> I don't have any... did he talk to you about your job?<eos> He's saying he's gonna take my job?<eos> You'll talk to him, right? I did.<eos> I did already.
Guess they burned the inside of the car to destroy any physical evidence.<eos> Eric, I just sent you a VIN.<eos> You run it for me?<eos> They burnt the trunk, too.<eos> Eric says cars are stolen. Got some, uh, clothing.<eos> Maybe a Halloween mask.<eos> Oh! I got servers.<eos> What?<eos> ! They would not burn those.<eos> Well, they did.
No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Adios. Hasta luego.<eos> Gracias. Hasta luego.<eos> Muchas gracias. Bye.<eos> Por nada.<eos> Yes, Agent Hanna, this is the gym bag with the money.<eos> How much did you say was in here?<eos> I didn't.
Previously on Reign...<eos> Husband?<eos> You can't have found someone already?<eos> We both know you just want to be rid of me.<eos> Greer, are you telling me that Lord Castleroy is a Protestant?<eos> Yes. Did you hire Montgomery to kill our father?<eos> No, I did it myself.
The only alliance I'm interested in is temporary, delicious, in bed.<eos> Francis...<eos> If this is about the village this morning, I didn't ask you because things there are still tense.<eos> Things are tense across France, but I have an idea, so hear me out, please.<eos> What if your sister Claude married Condé?<eos> Marry a royal to one of the most prominent Protestants in the country?<eos> Yes. An interfaith marriage.<eos> In your family.<eos> It sends a message.<eos> It certainly does.
- care more about my welfare than my own brother?<eos> - Claude, as royals, we are all at risk every day.<eos> But your marriage to Condé could bring peace to France.<eos> I care about me, not France.<eos> That's your job.<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> Narcisse is trying to scare you, to serve his own purposes.<eos> Do you really think he cares whether you live or die?<eos> He did offer to marry me himself, so he could attach himself to the royal line.<eos> Of course he did.
So don't delay seeking help if you start to feel sick.<eos> Maggie will stick around after the service if anybody has any questions.<eos> Our closing hymn is "for the beauty of the Earth."<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Langston.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Just wanted to come by and check in on you, see how it's been going.<eos> Any trouble since you've come back?<eos> I imagine this isn't a social call, Agent Bellamy, so just state your business and let's get on with it, shall we?<eos> I know about the bones under the factory, the fire, the men who returned.<eos> And so does Fred.

- And you think Trey, - the man wearing the wire, did this for a reason?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He was arrested by the police.<eos> He needed to give them someone - to lighten his sentence, so he gave 'em me.<eos> - Thank you, Cary.<eos> I know how difficult this has been.<eos> Uh, no further questions, Your Honor.<eos> You may sit.<eos> Prosecution have any questions?<eos> I do.
Well, then show me and stop going to her.<eos> Cary, come on, that's not what this is all about.<eos> - We don't do that to each other.<eos> - I can't think about anything else.<eos> I need to save myself, and all I do is picture you in bed with her.<eos> Cary, we're not married.<eos> We're not even going steady.<eos> But you mean something to me.<eos> Yes, I know I'm supposed to be a good sport, but I don't want to be with anyone else.<eos> I do.
You want to do some good?<eos> We make a photo op.<eos> - That's not doing a good deed.<eos> - Stop acting like this is about you becoming a better person...<eos> it's about you appearing like you're a better person.<eos> That's what the voters respect... the image of it.<eos> Oh, you think this is counterintuitive? - It is.<eos> - That's why you're bad at this and I'm good.<eos> You think reporters want something original?<eos> They don't.
Because for me, I became confident once I, like, pretended I was and forced myself into wearing things I was shy about.<eos> Did it come after for you or...<eos> I can't remember that far back.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you look beautiful as ever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm vertical, so I'm so happy.<eos> You know why I think you did this film?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because he's very handsome, and I think you really had a crush on him.<eos> - Everybody does.
Which never would've happened if you hadn't left her there.<eos> I was commanded by the king.<eos> I am your king!<eos> You answer to me!<eos> Leah, wait!<eos> You may not have admitted it to Jacob, but you tell me the truth.<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> Only that they met.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> Of course it did!
The queen is dead.<eos> I live here now.<eos> With your son?<eos> The boy I saw you with that day.<eos> I can walk alone, thank you.<eos> You're injured.<eos> I'm not letting you walk alone.<eos> And I have nothing to say about it?<eos> Oh, I'm sure you have plenty to say about it.<eos> You usually do.
Can't trace it. I'll have to wait for them to access the phone again, track it from there.<eos> Then I'll have our guy.<eos> Let me know when you do. Quinn...<eos> On Kubiak.<eos> Call me when you have something.<eos> David Rosen.<eos> You want me to prosecute your father?<eos> I assume you have evidence?<eos> Documents, let's say, that may or may not detail the extent of his criminal activity?<eos> We do.
So... Stakeouts are kind of boring, huh?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Are you ever gonna tell me?<eos> Why you left us.<eos> Me and mom.<eos> Look, it wasn't you or your mom, okay?<eos> It had nothing to do with you.<eos> Okay?<eos> You... you have to believe that.<eos> I do.
This warrant is worthless without being cosigned by a military judge.<eos> I don't need JAG approval, and you know it.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Move out.<eos> You really want to cooperate with me, give me the decryption key for the code from the black box on Holland's wingsuit.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Black boxes are Air Force property, and if you want access, you're gonna have to talk to them.<eos> You know what that is, right, Major?<eos> Yes, I do.
And... why wouldn't you give me a heads up?<eos> I didn't know about it.<eos> Really?<eos> The D.A. issues a blanket statement saying he won't prosecute certain crimes, and he doesn't share that tidbit with his own prosecutors?<eos> I don't like the guy.<eos> You always say that.<eos> You're seeing him.<eos> You're seeing him?<eos> Was.<eos> Did.
And why are you hunting a man who Father pardoned himself?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You think there's more to it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You don't want to dig into this. Why not?<eos> Do you think someone hired Montgomery?<eos> Father's madness, his obsession with England, threatened everyone.<eos> Even you.<eos> Francis, did you hire Montgomery to kill our father?<eos> I did it myself.
Oh, why is everyone so judgmental?<eos> It's worse out there, In the countryside, Which is why I want to stay here.<eos> It's not a return to court you desire.<eos> It's the very best place to be a princess.<eos> It's your mother's attention.<eos> Why would I want anything from her?<eos> She doesn't love me.<eos> Not the way she loves francis or any of her other children.<eos> You're right.<eos> She doesn't.
Take him off.<eos> Bone's dislodged from the socket, your majesty.<eos> I never meant for any of this to happen.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I didn't hear from you about my offer.<eos> Though attempting to frame me for treason Should be answer enough, I suppose.<eos> When did you know?<eos> I found the item you planted soon after you visited.<eos> When the kingsguard didn't immediately arrive, I thought you'd had a change of heart.<eos> I did, but...
Maybe god.<eos> Or secrets of the universe.<eos> The unknowable, ms.<eos> Tolliver.<eos> Nadine: The briefing book For the israeli coffee, ma'am.<eos> You really think I'll be able to read all... 172 pages between here and...<eos> Your communications department came through on short notice.<eos> (sighs) Well, luckily, I'm pretty well versed In israeli geopolitics.<eos> Nasa guy likes you, you know.<eos> He does not.
- It'S...<eos> It'S Not So Easy To Explain.<eos> - You Can'T Do This.<eos> - He'S Got Me In A Really Bad Spot, Vanessa.<eos> - What Is It--Blackmail?<eos> Don'T Even--<eos> Don'T Even Say Anything.<eos> You Don'T Have To Say Anything.<eos> - I-I Really Don'T Have A Choice Here.<eos> - Mr. Truman, Yes, You Do.
What are you doing?<eos> You look like a pervert.<eos> Putting a GPS tracker in his shoe.<eos> He is not getting away from me again, even if it means putting my favorite hand into his rotten stink-boot.<eos> Hoo-hoo! Did you see the menu?<eos> Lobster thermidor. Baked Alaska.<eos> It's so fancy, it don't even sound like food.<eos> Here, come on. Order something.<eos> Order it.<eos> Do it.
Hey! Hey.<eos> You faker.<eos> Go back to the apartment?<eos> Come on.<eos> Why don't you ever answer your mom's call?<eos> I talk to her plenty.<eos> Hey, I have Thanksgiving off.<eos> Why don't we go to Florida and meet her and your dad?<eos> No, I don't want to go home for Thanksgiving.<eos> You don't?
If you believe her, I've slept with every married man in Beverly Hills.<eos> Well, why would she say that?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Would you like a lawyer?<eos> No. I'd like to leave.<eos> I've done nothing wrong.<eos> How could you not tell us about the book?<eos> You didn't think it was important to our investigation?<eos> No, I didn't. My ex-husband doesn't even know about it.<eos> Cynthia does.
No.<eos> But being a detective and all...<eos> I'm pretty good at looking.<eos> She has a lot of enemies.<eos> She's candid, calls it like she sees it.<eos> If it's the truth.<eos> It's a good read.<eos> It's compelling.<eos> I'm getting the sense she really loved her husband.<eos> Until she didn't.
If they want to talk, let them talk.<eos> What the hell do you care?<eos> Because I care about the truth, care about authenticity.<eos> Or you just hate Stefan.<eos> I do actually, yeah.<eos> He abandoned his brother, turned me over to a vampire hunter, and he hurt the one girl who can honestly do no wrong.<eos> That's not why I care.<eos> No. I care because he does all that and is still considered a hero when I get stuck being a villain.<eos> Yeah, because you kill people.<eos> What, and Stefan doesn't?
It did.<eos> I fixed it.<eos> Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.<eos> I just couldn't bear to look at it again.<eos> You want to go inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Minos misjudged you. But do not let his mistake poison your heart.<eos> I fear it is too late.<eos> In the eyes of the Gods, it's never too late.<eos> You fainted.<eos> Your fall reopened your wound.<eos> Ah, you're back with us.<eos> Thank you for... for not leaving me.<eos> We should have done.<eos> You're nothing but trouble.<eos> ~ So why didn't you?
It has to do with everything we've been dealing with.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Okay, I'll see you soon.<eos> We've got embassy vehicles canvassing Villa 31.<eos> No visuals on Annie, McQuaid, or Belenko, but there's been reports of gunfire.<eos> I also heard from Maxim Gomelsky that the FSB has deployed a Vega force unit to Argentina.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Who do we have in the area?<eos> There's not a ton of need for paramilitary in Argentina, and even if there were, we can't send soldiers in.<eos> Russia did.
One more to go.<eos> We can make it.<eos> He's got position. We're sitting ducks.<eos> If we give him up now, we can save ourselves.<eos> I'm sorry, Annie. No, we are almost there.<eos> We're so close.<eos> He is a deadweight.<eos> He's gonna get us killed.<eos> Say "25-3" in clipped Russian, or we're all dead.<eos> Do it again.
Can I get a 3-D vascular reconstruction, too? - Do you need that?<eos> - We need the images that we need.<eos> In your opinion.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Derek, why are you pushing back on this?<eos> Pierce and I both agree...<eos> I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong, and she called me for an opinion.<eos> She called me for an opinion, as well.<eos> Of course she did.
- Exagger--<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> You guys don't think Alec is real?<eos> Sweetheart, I remember the pressure there was to fit in in high school.<eos> So do I. And whether you try to fit in by saying you fought a baby bear or by making up a boyfriend...<eos> You guys are so unbelievable.<eos> You really think I'm that pathetic that I'd have to create some imaginary boyfriend?<eos> You know what's not imaginary?<eos> Your feelings.<eos> Okay, don't! don't!
Oh. [Chuckles] That's nice.<eos> Everything else good?<eos> [Sighs] One day at a time.<eos> Well, keep it up.<eos> You make me so proud.<eos> Thanks, Chaplain.<eos> Don't be crying poor on me, Capp.<eos> I know what your side job pulls in, come on.<eos> You don't even know what my side job is.<eos> Sure I do.
All right.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Let us show you the inside.<eos> - It's all yours, Padre.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Careful with the parking brake!<eos> Anyone heard from Mills and Brett? Nope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Does a fireman named Matt work here?<eos> Um, yeah. Yeah, he does.
It's taking it all seriously.<eos> That might be a Jag, but it's mental.<eos> Even I can slither about in that and sort it out. It's...<eos> -It's...<eos> -It's got a sticky front and a loose back end.<eos> -And who doesn't like that?<eos> -Yeah, exactly.<eos> Not a phrase for a first date, obviously.<eos> No, exactly.<eos> But I do like...
At least rookies feel fresh, you don't even feel earnest.<eos> I do too!<eos> Then go to auditions.<eos> If you find a good film, toss your pride and chase it.<eos> Then again, auditions aren't easy.<eos> Of course they are.<eos> Because I'm so pretty.<eos> You have... no sincerity.<eos> -Why the hell not?<eos> -Girls like you never do.
If you'll excuse me, the games are not yet over.<eos> I pray with all my heart that you will triumph.<eos> He's a fortunate man.<eos> She must think highly of him to come down here in person.<eos> I don't presume to know the Queen's mind.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's Leonidas there.<eos> He's good.<eos> I thought you said he never loses?<eos> He doesn't.
Anytime.<eos> Um... Sorry, here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing, she's great.<eos> Everything's great.<eos> And that's a good thing, right?<eos> I just don't have any excuses now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I gave her up so that she could have this great life.<eos> And she does.
- Bye. - Bye.<eos> "Closed"<eos> He's a pussy!<eos> A pussy!<eos> Yeah, you say that, but he was the one who did it.<eos> Bring something to eat; croissants or something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just heat up the water.<eos> I didn't know you worked today.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yeah. That way, they will never suspect me.<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Sarah, hey, listen, I can't talk right now.<eos> I'm in the middle of...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Why didn't he tell us?<eos> Well, I can't be there right now.<eos> Talk to him.<eos> I have to go. That didn't sound like Christmas-present coordination.<eos> No, it didn't.
Oh, yes, I am spectacularly good at that kind of thing.<eos> Putting aside the fact that my love sits cursed in a cave, I'm happy to help.<eos> Thank you, but I actually don't think it's such a bad thing being on your own.<eos> Oh, absolutely, I agree.<eos> Have you ever known anything else?<eos> That's beside the point.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing, he slept.<eos> - You slept?<eos> - No, I didn't. The whole night.
Sometimes we are blind to those we hold dearest.<eos> Here we go, old friend. I won't let this meal be your last.<eos> - I am not sure I am hungry.<eos> - But you will eat.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Pasiphae will stop at nothing until I am dead.<eos> And do you know what the strange thing is?<eos> That doesn't scare me any more.<eos> You must have great faith in your protectors.<eos> Indeed I do.
Pickin' it apart.<eos> Oh, my God, did you carry us up here like suitcases?<eos> No, man.<eos> This is real life.<eos> I rolled you in on the cart.<eos> Boo! Terry sucks! Terry sucks!<eos> Terry's great. Terry's great.<eos> Where do you want the food?<eos> And does braided herring and jellied starfish count as food?<eos> Oh, indeed it does.
I know the voice. I invented the voice.<eos> I use the voice.<eos> Wait. So, I can't pull off mid-thigh shorts?<eos> No, you can.<eos> Pull them off and give them to somebody 20 years younger.<eos> You're so silly!<eos> What are you two giggling about?<eos> Haley just asked me --<eos> Oh, you don't want to know, trust me.<eos> No, I do.
I use the voice.<eos> Wait. So, I can't pull off mid-thigh shorts?<eos> No, you can.<eos> Pull them off and give them to somebody 20 years younger.<eos> You're so silly!<eos> What are you two giggling about?<eos> Haley just asked me --<eos> Oh, you don't want to know, trust me.<eos> No, I do.<eos> I do. I do. I do.
Oh.<eos> Well, great. I'm just gonna go vomit forever now.<eos> What are you guys doing? - Uh, nothing. - Just talking.<eos> - Not really anything.<eos> Can we finish our conversation?<eos> No. Lily, I'm sorry, but if you have questions, you're gonna have to ask your dads.<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> - I do so.<eos> - Uh-huh, I know.<eos> No, we don't.
You're the second victim's uncle.<eos> Sons of bitches.<eos> My nephew is dead.<eos> My sister's world has just ended.<eos> And you come in here and you throw accusations?<eos> Maybe I'm dirty, too.<eos> I helped Flynn rip this place off, and then, for no good reason, pulled Casey in.<eos> No one is accusing you of anything, but you're the only connection we could find between the two victims.<eos> We just wanted to know if they knew each other.<eos> They didn't.
I will come for you, Eurydice.<eos> I promise.<eos> So many tombs.<eos> We shouldn't linger here.<eos> There.<eos> It has to be them.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> The dead don't light fires.<eos> I hope one day somebody loves me like that.<eos> Somebody already does.
I apologize, but I'm late.<eos> Your apology is accepted.<eos> Goodbye Mother.<eos> Injected.<eos> He is not usually like this.<eos> I'm surprised you're not more worried about him.<eos> Were he my responsibility...<eos> I would be.<eos> We had been told that Chief-Elder knew everything.<eos> Things no body else did.
There will be a nice ceremony.<eos> Now you get some rest.<eos> - I felt things.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know that ther is something more.<eos> - Fiona ...<eos> Something missing from our lives.<eos> No, not "missing"; something that has been stolen from me and from You.<eos> I do not know what it is exactly.<eos> But Jonas does.
I felt real joy ...<eos> Then you should know better then anyone.<eos> You have seen children starve ...<eos> Yes.<eos> You have seen people stabbing on each other's neck ...<eos> Just for the view.<eos> You know what it is peoples like when men blow each others up.<eos> Yes<eos> - Over a simple land, sand ...<eos> - I do, I do.
I haven't seen her in a while.<eos> Was it a bad breakup?<eos> Did they just have sex in here?<eos> It's better not to know. But yes.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Good question.<eos> I really only know Danny and the groom.<eos> Do you know that person?<eos> No.<eos> No, I do not.
I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> You'd think after six years of rehearsing that moment, I'd have something more interesting to say.<eos> I don't think she noticed.<eos> And she probably rehearsed it, too.<eos> Six years?<eos> How'd you guys meet?<eos> Sophomore year.<eos> Georgetown.<eos> I was pre-med, if you can believe that.<eos> I don't.
Imports, movements of goods, have all ceased.<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in when people like you fuck up.<eos> - I'm accountable now.<eos> - I don't like your tone...<eos> You have taken Mr. Pushkin's money for years.<eos> Money that comes with conditions.<eos> Non-negotiable conditions.<eos> Problem you're having with me is you think you matter.<eos> You don't.
You don't know her.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.<eos> We're a lot alike.<eos> We had families, but we both grew up in this palace, isolated and alone.<eos> I liked to go to the library and bury myself in a good book.<eos> My favorite was an ancient norse legend...<eos> The Trolden Glass.<eos> Perhaps you read it.<eos> Of course I did.
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.<eos> I have words that would be howled in the desert air<eos> where hearing should not latch them.<eos> My ever gentle cousin.<eos> Stands Scotland where it did?<eos> Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.<eos> How does my wife?
What will happen to me if I fail your test?<eos> Ava...<eos> Will it be bad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you think I might be switched off, because I don't function as well as I'm supposed to?<eos> Ava, I don't know the answer to your question.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> Why is it up to anyone?<eos> Do you have people who test you and might switch you off?<eos> No, I don't.
Ava...<eos> Will it be bad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you think I might be switched off, because I don't function as well as I'm supposed to?<eos> Ava, I don't know the answer to your question.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> Why is it up to anyone?<eos> Do you have people who test you and might switch you off?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Then why do I?
You understand, it doesn't burn the leaves, it just heats them up enough to release and activate the THC.<eos> So, it feels like you're inhaling cool air, with a light kind of candy corn taste.<eos> Trust me, when you smoke as much as we do, it's the only way to go.<eos> I mean, your lungs are the gateway to the bloodstream, and they have to last you a lifetime.<eos> John used to be a two pack a day smoker<eos> - when we met.<eos> - You are a goddess, and you saved my life.<eos> Of course, baby.<eos> You boys don't smoke cigarettes, do you?<eos> - He does.
I don't know.<eos> Boy?<eos> Or boxtroll?<eos> Dresses like a boxtroll, but looks like a boy!<eos> A boy-troll.<eos> Yes, or a box-boy?<eos> A new species never seen before.<eos> No boxtrolls<eos> Trubshaw Senior loved his kid<eos> The same as regular fathers did
Ten seconds.<eos> Seven-point-two seconds and getting stronger.<eos> We're trending exponentially.<eos> That's our new curve.<eos> Jesus, it's worse than we thought.<eos> Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?<eos> Two men were just arrested in the Q-zone.<eos> We've got bigger problems here.<eos> Have Dr. Graham take a look.<eos> She did, sir.
The whole time?<eos> Why didn't you...<eos> - kill it when you had the chance?<eos> - It was absorbing... radiation from the reactors.<eos> We worried killing it... might release that radiation and endanger millions.<eos> That's why our mission was to contain it.<eos> To study its biology, to understand it.<eos> We knew the creature was having an electrical effect... on everything within a close proximity.<eos> What we didn't know... was that it could harness this same power... in an EMP attack.<eos> But your father did.
Where are we going today, Mr. Peabody?<eos> Not "where," Sherman.<eos> "When."<eos> This is the biggest house I've ever seen!<eos> It's the Palace of Versailles, home of Marie Antoinette.<eos> You know, she was mostly famous for one thing.<eos> Cake!<eos> I love cake so much.<eos> Marie Antoinette sure likes cake, Mr. Peabody.<eos> Indeed, she does.
Sherman.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go explore.<eos> Well, I'm supposed to be having father-son time with Mr. Peabody.<eos> Wouldn't you rather have fun with me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Sherman... where are you going?<eos> Exploring.<eos> But we need your help.<eos> No, we don't!
Stop being such a party pooper and enjoy it!<eos> Nothing is as beautiful as an elegant equation... translated into perfect engineering.<eos> Why can't children be so simple?<eos> Because children are not machines, Peabody.<eos> Believe me, I tried to build one.<eos> It was creepy.<eos> Here, Sherman!<eos> You fly it!<eos> But I don't want to fly!<eos> Sure you do.
So I am presenting Boyd Jr. As a candidate for holy baptism.<eos> Except I figure I'm gonna call him BJ.<eos> Welcome to the family, BJ.<eos> (BABY CRYING) Dear God, I look around this table and I see a family.<eos> I know we're not perfect, Lord God, even though some people think they are.<eos> We've all got foibles, peccadillos, if you will.<eos> I'm not gonna name names, Dave, it's not the time nor the place.<eos> Anyhow, I just wanna say thank you, Lord Jesus, Lamb of God, for bringing us together here.<eos> Now each one of us is going to say something they're thankful for.<eos> Donna, do it.
Well, you're the only one who ate squirrel.<eos> Ours was really chicken.<eos> You did say that you could handle anything as long as the kids were having a good Christmas, and the kids are having a great Christmas.<eos> Think you can just flex those emotional muscles just a little bit? Think of Douglas.<eos> I want more dessert.<eos> And that's how you make $50 an hour.<eos> Poobah?<eos> Yeah, Dougie? I wanted to leave Santa a snack, but Rance ate all the cookies in like 10 seconds, and then he drank a whole gallon of milk.<eos> Whoa. So, I was wondering if you had anything else that I could give to Santa?<eos> 'Course I do, Bug.
I just didn't want to be left behind.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> But you got to do what I say.<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm going to school.<eos> I'm really going to school. When do we learn, Henry?<eos> Shh. Stop that.<eos> Shh. You made a dumb move coming in to school today.<eos> Warren, I'm sorry.<eos> I really didn't...
Ah, Mom, sister Meagan. I don't believe we've met. I'm Cody.<eos> You guys should probably sit down.<eos> So, lovely ladies, what's shaking? Well, this is my friend Cody.<eos> Are your hormones still raging, Meagan?<eos> You did not just say that.<eos> - Cody, no.<eos> - What? Henry, where did you get Cody?<eos> I found him in the trash all messed up, so I fixed him.<eos> Henry, honey, people don't throw away something like a Cody.<eos> But someone did.
Cannot breathe.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> I wasn't sure if I'd ever see you again.<eos> It was Allan's idea to come see you guys.<eos> You're looking good, Mom.<eos> - Love the hair.<eos> Can you excuse me for a moment?<eos> See, Dad? I told you Mom was pretty.<eos> So, does Cody have a mom?<eos> - Meagan! - No. Actually, he doesn't.
You're a little snick-snack.<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> "In squalid ether, digital-surveillance nightmare.<eos> Shattered wings catapult the vast vulva of shattered oblivion."<eos> It's astonishing.<eos> Tell me what you really think of it, poet to poet, mentor to protégé.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Do you think I could be a real poet?<eos> - Snicks.<eos> - Do you?
Really, really bad.<eos> Dude, that was traumatizing.<eos> Can we vote to push him through? Because I can't see that ever again.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Push him through!<eos> I don't know. Can he say it?<eos> Can you say it?<eos> Prove it!<eos> I don't want to watch you dance again.<eos> I really don't.
That is your task. And when we drive them of?<eos> What then?<eos> Will they not spread to other lands?<eos> Other lands are not my concern.<eos> The fortunes of the world will rise and fall.<eos> But here in this kingdom we will endure.<eos> Legolas said you fought well today.<eos> He's grown very fond of you.<eos> I assure you my lord, Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.<eos> Perhaps he did once.
He loosen a scale under the left wing.<eos> One more shot and he would have killed the beast.<eos> That's a fairy story lad, nothing more.<eos> You took our money.<eos> Where are the weapons?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Tomorrow begins the last day of autumn.<eos> - Durin's day falls morning after next.<eos> We must reach the mountain before then.<eos> And if we do not?
- In the car.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Well, the three of us are gonna go to Las Vegas for the weekend.<eos> Why on earth would I ever want to go to Vegas?<eos> For fun!<eos> Remember fun?<eos> That thing you used to have before the permanent scowl set in?<eos> Come on, I don't have a permanent scowl.<eos> - He said with a scowl.<eos> - I don't!
- Where is the pool?<eos> Welcome to Las Vegas.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Relax, Gherson. - Yeah.<eos> It's not like you invented it.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> We got a bikini contest coming up!<eos> Who wants to be a judge?<eos> I do!
Paid me with this.<eos> Do not touch rock!<eos> Rock cursed.<eos> lnjun's right.<eos> Worthless around here.<eos> But get it to San Francisco, they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.<eos> Maybe I'll be on the first train west.<eos> Retire.<eos> Do you have cat?<eos> I did.
YOU SPOT THE NORTH STAR WITH THE HORIZON.<eos> BUT IT WILL ONLY GIVE US HALF OF OUR LOCATION.<eos> BRING BRESLIN.<eos> I'LL EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS LATER, BUT FIRST WE'VE GOT TO GET IT TOPSIDE.<eos> WATCH OUT.<eos> WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME, MR. BRESLIN.<eos> SECTION E.<eos> WAITING FOR INMATES.<eos> YOU KNOW WHO I AM?<eos> I DO NOW.
Sure.<eos> Hey, how's your sister?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She talk about me?<eos> No.<eos> So, Friday, we'll all go down together.<eos> Make a road trip of it, I'll drive.<eos> Don't think I can.<eos> I think I've got a doctor's appointment.<eos> Yeah, you do. With Dr. Ink!
You look like you could do with a drink.<eos> Now, let's have a little chat about your future, shall we, hmm?<eos> Uh, Mr. Shepherd?<eos> Please, call me Guy.<eos> All right.<eos> Guy...<eos> Look at you.<eos> Are you a robot?<eos> Does anyone know what robot means?<eos> Yeah. I do!
One victim reported.<eos> Medical assistance is en route.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Right behind the line.<eos> Please, everybody, stay back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Tony!<eos> - He's with me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks for doing this, Jansen.
For not minding her own business, is for what.<eos> For having a big mouth, is for what.<eos> For asking too many questions, is for what.<eos> You better be careful following her example, Billy.<eos> I might have to hire someone to investigate you.<eos> Who you gonna have do that?<eos> Your boy Murdock?<eos> I don't think he's available for the job.<eos> - I hope he didn't suffer.<eos> - No more than Andrews did.
- Due to the tigers' appearance.<eos> - I got scared of the tigers.<eos> - Yeah. Literally, when the second tiger came out, I went and then I shat.<eos> I shat in the theater.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> You guys Okay?<eos> - I broke my ass in half.<eos> - Here. Shit, they got through!<eos> - You guys fucking did it.
Mom is not a sad one.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You know, during her final days at the hospital,<eos> Mom sometimes thought I was you.<eos> She even called me David for a whole day, once.<eos> And, I played along.<eos> Because...<eos> Mia, look.<eos> I wanted to be there.<eos> Okay, I did.
"Gimme, gimme, gimme."<eos> No one I can trust, no one I can talk to.<eos> I hate my life sometimes.<eos> I really do.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> No matter how many people are around, I'm all by myself.<eos> Like, I'm with people-- they're not really my family or my friends.<eos> You know what that feels like?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- I don't know.<eos> - Why? 'Cause I'm afraid you wouldn't like it.<eos> But I'm proud of what you're doing!<eos> I'm like a proud papa!<eos> I think it's great!<eos> Maybe when I'm done with this one, you can hear it.<eos> Whenever you want me to hear.<eos> Scott, we should talk.<eos> I think our relationship is in a really good place, don't you?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I do.
My will.<eos> - Did you ever execute this will?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did anyone witness your executed will?<eos> When you mean "executed", uh...<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> - I mean-- - He doesn't understand "executed" to mean signing.<eos> What did you mean when you said "executed"?<eos> Well, you mean, did I ever sign it?<eos> No, I never did. No.
Are you having another attack?<eos> I didn't even mention New York.<eos> Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.<eos> Okay...<eos> God, what am I gonna do?<eos> Just breathe. Really, just breathe.<eos> You're a mechanic, right?<eos> Right.<eos> You said so.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yes. Yes.<eos> His think tank thinked it up.<eos> The pathology of a serial killer.<eos> The manipulation of Western iconography.<eos> Ready for another lesson?<eos> No.<eos> Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.<eos> Your performance?<eos> Where people died?<eos> No, they didn't.
In the garage.<eos> Hope you have a few days.<eos> Awesome.<eos> What the...<eos> Hey, I don't know if you heard the news, but Trey is getting married.<eos> And, well, Elka, I had this really cool, really fun idea that I thought you would love.<eos> I'm gonna call you back.<eos> Elka?<eos> - Yes. - I didn't know you still talked.<eos> We don't.
- Dude...<eos> - I wanted to.<eos> Mom and Dad would not let me invite you.<eos> - That's...<eos> - He took my phone.<eos> - They're like fucking children.<eos> - Yeah. I don't know how you've put up with them all these years.<eos> Trey, I am sorry I messed up your wedding.<eos> No. You didn't.<eos> No, no one did.
Somebody!<eos> Please help me!<eos> Welcome to Los Angeles, ma'am.<eos> Patty, it was the strangest thing.<eos> I arrested Whalen, next thing you know, lickety-split, he escapes.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> He overpowered you again?<eos> - No.<eos> - He just slipped his cuffs?<eos> He sure did.
Go ahead, detective.<eos> - Hey, sugar.<eos> - Hey, Jerry.<eos> Here comes Mr. Five By Five<eos> Ladies.<eos> Solid avoirdupois<eos> Mr. Five By Five<eos> He's 5 feet tall and he's 5 feet wide<eos> He don't measure no more from head to toe<eos> Than he do from side to side
Please, Connie.<eos> Jerry Wooters.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you too.<eos> What'd you bring?<eos> Bear claws.<eos> Congratulations. I didn't...<eos> Thank you.<eos> John didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
You were both fucked-up.<eos> You were fucked-up.<eos> You are fucked-up.<eos> You'd better understand this, you smug little ingrate.<eos> There's at least one reason why Beverly killed himself, and that is you.<eos> You think there's any way in hell that he would've done what he did if you were still here?<eos> No!<eos> Just him and me in this house, alone, in the dark, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort.<eos> Oh, yes, you stick that knife of judgment in me, go ahead, but make no mistake, his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine.<eos> He did this, though.
That's correct.<eos> A car with a kind of patchwork paint job came toward me. Swerving over into my lane.<eos> Looked like he was drunk.<eos> The driver was a man, Miss Claymans?<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> Should I say who he was?<eos> If you know.<eos> It was Rusty Berkhart.<eos> And you told all this to the detectives?<eos> I sure did.
Do you remember Hazel Cole calling you... To say that she found an earring, several weeks after the murder?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And do you remember Rusty Berkhart saying the earring was his?<eos> No, I don't remember that.<eos> Your Honor, defense exhibit number 17.<eos> You recognize this? Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's my earring.<eos> Detective Welch, do you recognize the two voices on that tape?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm sure he's a real nice fellow. But do you really want that spoiled rich son-of-a-bitch fuck... to be your next president?<eos> Think about it.<eos> We'll cheer for you, Mr. Vice President.<eos> Thank you, Cecil.<eos> Let me ask you something, in all candor... as members of the Negro community, what are your biggest concerns?<eos> Now, come on now, boys.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Holloway, come on.<eos> Well, since you asked, sir...<eos> I did.
I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?<eos> She's absolutely not to know.<eos> You're supposed to invite her over... so he can happen to pass by.<eos> I remember feeling torn.<eos> Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman... together with a man I hardly knew?<eos> When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit from tower to cellar... as if for another wild party.<eos> But there wasn't a sound.<eos> - Thank you. - Have a good night.<eos> Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island.<eos> - Does it?
I'd like to know who he is and what he does.<eos> And I think I'll make a point of finding out.<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Ask them in the kitchen.<eos> - To the left.<eos> Yeah... we'll pile that stuff in the garage, it's going back to town.<eos> Well... there you are.<eos> She asked me to tell you... she had a wonderful time.<eos> She didn't like it.<eos> Of course she did.
Do I have to do it myself?<eos> You think I come here to admire the view?<eos> - I'm sorry, I'm sick.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why, what's the matter? - I don't know.<eos> I'm all run down. I need money...<eos> - real bad.<eos> - What?<eos> My wife and I, we wanna go West.<eos> Your wife does?
"He sent them back to the place of their birth. "Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.<eos> "Erik severed the link... "... between giants and men."<eos> "And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> "The mystical relics... "... were all that remained... "... safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> "And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep... "... he took crown and seed with him... "... for permanent keep."<eos> "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away... "... truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.<eos> - But what if they do?
Sacha.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not that I...<eos> I know I've burdened you with my problems.<eos> I know you have your own concerns.<eos> I don't need your pity if that's what you're trying to say.<eos> Sacha, please.<eos> Let me help you with your father.<eos> You think you know everything, Mariah Mundi.<eos> Well, you don't!
- No, people don't.<eos> Why would they have it so you can move it around if you weren't going to move it around?<eos> No, I think you're right.<eos> I think you're allowed to move it around.<eos> It's certainly a different experience of it.<eos> I agree.<eos> See, I thought that that belonged here.<eos> It's just... it's the perfect spot.<eos> It certainly changes everything.<eos> - It does.
Why...?<eos> Why?<eos> Why would he run?<eos> I've just spent 10 hours questioning this boy.<eos> Okay? I hear what you're saying.<eos> Did you give him a lie detector?<eos> You gave us a lie...<eos> Did you give him one?<eos> I understand what you're asking me.<eos> Yes, we did.
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.<eos> The concept of back-up still has no appeal to you?<eos> My besties here can ball with anyone.<eos> No disrespect for your crew, of course, who look strong, too, in those matchy-matchyoutfits.<eos> Shit.<eos> Didn't know there was a dress code.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> Well, it's not my intention to jump another man's claim.<eos> If you don't mind, maybe we'll just pull up a chair and spectate for a while.<eos> What if I do?
- Yeah, he knows.<eos> - Wants to do it his own way, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You can take him home.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As you can see, Mr. Cassidy, the last two procedures were not covered by insurance.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have extended coverage.<eos> You did.
I'm the reason for all of this.<eos> The real question is what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I'm going to use what they taught me to destroy what they built.<eos> Don't remember inviting you.<eos> My going-away party got this whole thing rolling.<eos> I thought it was only fair that I show up for yours.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Goddard orchestrated this whole thing to entrap you into committing a crime.<eos> I didn't commit a crime.<eos> You did.
You can't just...<eos> Hamilton.<eos> Jack's hometown.<eos> Nick...<eos> Meachum.<eos> That's one down.<eos> One more to go.<eos> Whatever you have better be good.<eos> If it works, we both walk away with an insurance policy no amount of money can buy.<eos> Yeah, but if it doesn't?
Margarita?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You like porno?<eos> - I like some.<eos> You like 'em.<eos> - No.<eos> - I can tell.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.<eos> Wives can't testify against husbands.<eos> Look, all I need is money.<eos> Look, after paying your bail, I have, um, 32, 33 dollars.<eos> Linda, real money.<eos> It's the IRS and the Miami PD, and it's all just that shakedown.<eos> - Do you have enough?<eos> - "We."<eos> Baby, do we have enough, right?<eos> - No, we don't. - Mm-mm.
- Yeah.<eos> No, look, the point is, we traffic in fantasy here.<eos> Yeah, she's very real, the kind of girl you sit next to her in class.<eos> You see her out on the street, you want to ball her.<eos> But, you know, you've seen the girls that come in and do this now.<eos> I mean, they've all been to the surgeon.<eos> I mean, you can't light your cigarette around 'em.<eos> You're afraid their tits are gonna go up like the Hindenburg or something.<eos> - Linda has tits.<eos> - She does.
I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do, guys.<eos> Things just got interesting.<eos> Eli Pettifog, the Whittman Hares star player just stepped out on the stage.<eos> That boy has not missed a question all season long.<eos> He has got brains.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's got hair.<eos> Where the hell have you been? Where the hell have you been?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yes, we do.
- You need any help?<eos> - I can do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, neighbor.<eos> Heidi's been gone an hour and I don't know where she is.<eos> - Well, she's probably just wandering.<eos> - Heidi is not a wanderer.<eos> That's 'cause she's never had anywhere to wander to.<eos> Now she does.
But it was the last time I saw her.<eos> After that I only had the path ahead.<eos> There was no turning back, and no road home.<eos> "In 1960, Zhang Yongcheng died of illness.<eos> Ip Man never returned to Foshan."<eos> Okay, begin.<eos> Left fist out, Palm open, turn the wrist, pull back, right fist, out, open, twist the wrist, pull back.<eos> Mr. Ip. All encounters in this world... are a kind of reunion.<eos> They say I popularized Wing Chun. I hope they're right.<eos> I never did it for fame.
- Would you...?<eos> And a ring to marry her.<eos> That's the point of all of this.<eos> Would you... would you cut off your own arm and feet to see her here right now and... and maybe hold her in the leftover arm for, like, 10 seconds and just lay your face against the right side of her neck?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> See?<eos> You see?<eos> - You don't deserve her.<eos> - Oh, and you do, huh?
The calf muscle is very strong.<eos> You can hang like this for days without tearing muscle.<eos> Okay, you are the old Italian man.<eos> I am the priest.<eos> And this is our confession.<eos> So, what are your sins, my son?<eos> And you say something like, "Oh, bless me, father, for I have sinned.<eos> "It's been so and so many days since my last confession, and these are my sins."<eos> Now, you know what that means to confess, no?<eos> Of course you do.
You're lucky your head's harder than any rock in this place.<eos> You'll live.<eos> Don't be too sure about that, Doc.<eos> What happened?<eos> Tell him.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Like hell!<eos> I thought you didn't lie.<eos> Kyle slipped.<eos> Sure he did.
So, you know, now that you're back--<eos> Just a second, Max.<eos> Two seconds.<eos> Dominica.<eos> Can you take over here?<eos> Hey, listen. Now, you know, because you're back and everything--<eos> Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Stay out of trouble.<eos> I do.
Yeah, yeah. Yankeelrish. Yeah.<eos> From now on this one is called Irish, okay?<eos> Irish. Irish.<eos> Okay, Irish. What else you carrying?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> TV? Car?<eos> TV and car?<eos> No, no. We just got the food<eos> Dollars?<eos> We do. Kenny?
Werewolves aren't demons.<eos> We have a truce with Downworlders.<eos> Downworlders?<eos> What is that, people below 14th Street?<eos> Well, Downworlders pretty much sums everything up.<eos> Vampires, werewolves, warlocks.<eos> Warlocks.<eos> Cool.<eos> So how do you kill a zombie?<eos> - We don't.
No one comes up here anymore.<eos> We have the place to ourselves.<eos> This is breathtaking.<eos> Sorry, there's no cake.<eos> I was expecting nothing. So this is great.<eos> Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.<eos> - What did you get?<eos> - Weapons, mostly.<eos> - I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.<eos> - At this point nothing really does.
I might. I might.<eos> Well...<eos> Now, ain't that a persistent son of a bitch?<eos> That's twice in 24 hours it's gone by toward Hollenbach's.<eos> Maybe after six years, somebody's finally looking to buy that place.<eos> Gotta be from out of the area, wouldn't you say, John?<eos> Nobody local's gonna buy that place, knowing its history.<eos> Be like walking on Ira and Molly's graves.<eos> You believe in ghosts, John?<eos> - As much as I don't. - Yeah, sure.
There's over $4,000 there.<eos> I didn't trouble counting it.<eos> What's going on, John?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Hey, you remember that farm?<eos> We used to talk about buying that farm.<eos> - You remember that?<eos> - You used to talk about it.<eos> I don't want to live on no farm.<eos> Sure, you do.
They might run us national unless those douchebags in Baltimore snake us again.<eos> I don't want to bother you.<eos> Oh, I'm just going through some of your dad's stuff.<eos> I probably should have buried him in his madras shorts.<eos> Would have felt more like a vacation.<eos> I talked to Terri like you suggested.<eos> It wasn't bad, right? It was great.<eos> And um... the other night, too.<eos> That really happened, didn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, it did.
You could say that.<eos> I've been working for extra jobs just to try to keep my head above water.<eos> You like Charlie?<eos> Everybody likes Charlie.<eos> Anything you don't like about him?<eos> Anything unusual?<eos> - Like what? - I don't know.<eos> Kind of thing maybe you wouldn't expect at an all-night diner.<eos> You know who owns the place.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Lena, you have great powers.<eos> I can teach you how to use them.<eos> I can teach you how to become the most powerful Dark Caster who ever lived.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you, Mama.<eos> Oh, baby. This mortal you think you love?<eos> You can never be together.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever love me, Mama?<eos> You know, I don't remember.<eos> No mother does, really.
Oh, my God!<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> I've got to tell you something.<eos> This is kind of weird.<eos> - Please do not freak out. - No.<eos> But I actually miss him.<eos> - You... You miss him?<eos> - I know, it's so stupid.<eos> - Like you're attracted to him?<eos> - No, I don't...
It's only now just coming on the market.<eos> That's sad.<eos> It's not so sad.<eos> It had to go to somebody.<eos> OK, peeps.<eos> Lunch?<eos> Lunch, for sure.<eos> OK, I see how it is.<eos> Ah, well, at least we agreed on something.<eos> Yes, we do...at last.
Was it that many?<eos> Do you think she was trying to leave and couldn't?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you please be quiet?<eos> I can say whatever I want.<eos> I can't be stuck here!<eos> I don't think any of us want to be stuck here.<eos> We need to be patient, because someone is gonna come.<eos> Some of us have a life, OK?<eos> We do!
Here.<eos> - Just hold it like this.<eos> I'm not really the baby holding type.<eos> It's easy.<eos> Even a super advanced future turkey can do it.<eos> Oh, she wants you to throw up some worms into her mouth.<eos> What girl wouldn't?<eos> Oh, that's sweet and disgusting.<eos> I think she likes me.<eos> Yeah, maybe she does.
She's worked her magic on you.<eos> I'd hoped you'd be able to see through her.<eos> Glinda, so naive.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> That's why it was so easy for my sister to kill him.<eos> She only killed a man, not what he believed in.<eos> Begone, Witch, before the Wizard makes mush of you!<eos> How sweet.<eos> You all believe in him.<eos> Well, so did I, once.
Oh, no.<eos> He said it was going to be his greatest trick yet.<eos> Did he tell you the trick was on us?<eos> How predictable.<eos> I knew that buffoon of yours couldn't be the Wizard.<eos> Out of my way!<eos> Give up, Glinda.<eos> Why do you continue to resist?<eos> Because I believe in the Wizard.<eos> So did I, once.
Sponsorship agreements, for example. All of them.<eos> And the faith of all the cancer survivors around the world.<eos> So everything I do off of the bike would go away, too.<eos> And don't think for a second I don't understand that.<eos> Yeah, that was...<eos> Honestly, it's embarrassing to hear.<eos> It's humiliating.<eos> That was going too far.<eos> I know that now.<eos> I didn't at the time.
Hein Verbruggen and Lance Armstrong have always been friends.<eos> The UCI denies that they ever covered up a drug test for Lance Armstrong, but they do say that when Lance and other top riders tested with suspicious levels, they would go and talk to those riders and they would say,<eos> "Listen, you're flying a little too close to the sun.<eos> "We're going to be watching you.<eos> "You better stop what you're doing."<eos> There were dozens, if not hundreds, of those conversations going, "Hey, this is close."<eos> But the truth is that everybody was making money.<eos> Everybody.<eos> And I mean everybody.<eos> Trek Bicycles, in 1998, does $100 million in revenue.
Or was the comeback a new lie to replace the old one?<eos> Armstrong was in a position of saying,<eos> "Look, I'm gonna do what I did in '99.<eos> "I'm gonna come in in the wake of this.<eos> "I'm gonna clean up my name. I'm gonna prove that I'm doing it clean."<eos> it's like a bank robber breaking back into the bank again with everyone watching, feeling he would get away with it. Feeling sure he would get away with it.<eos> Lance Armstrong!<eos> Maybe this is why they came after you.<eos> It's almost like you were daring them to look under the hood.<eos> And they did.
- Hallowed halls where all great lawyers are born.<eos> - Father, what if...<eos> The long nights, studying under the stars...<eos> - And soon your diploma will hang next to mine.<eos> - Father...<eos> What if... what if I didn't actually start this year?<eos> Because I...<eos> Because I don't want to be a lawyer.<eos> - Hm? - Yet.<eos> Of course you do.
- I wish you hadn't come.<eos> - What?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, I wish you weren't here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What I mean is, I don't want anything to happen to you.<eos> - Shall we finish them off?<eos> - Let's finish them off.<eos> - The boy needs us.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Leave us.<eos> Adriana, leave us.<eos> Then one night, it all ended.<eos> How?<eos> Something had happened...<eos> I don't know what, but it was the last time I ever saw her.<eos> There are patients waiting for you.<eos> Send them away.<eos> You do not send patients away!<eos> Do it now!
Seeing them.<eos> No.<eos> They never seem to stay dead.<eos> How's it going over there?<eos> There's stuff on here, but it's password protected.<eos> I know, but can you open it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?<eos> We don't.
What?<eos> What I just called in.<eos> It wasn't the right code.<eos> Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.<eos> What?<eos> Fuck!<eos> They got to the emergency phones.<eos> Just let me think.<eos> No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
I just don't wanna make any more mistakes.<eos> I'm done with that.<eos> I let him take from me the two things that mattered most:<eos> You and boxing.<eos> I just shut it out.<eos> I don't even have a TV.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Because I'm afraid I might flip to a fight by accident and be embarrassed because I'm a fighter.<eos> I was born to be a fighter. I had some talent.<eos> I did.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I wanna be one more than anything.<eos> What's your simulator score?<eos> Fifty-one drops, 51 kills.<eos> Wow, that's amazing.<eos> But you're not one of the candidates tomorrow?<eos> I am not.<eos> The marshal has his reasons.<eos> Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?
Oh, Mark, where...<eos> where's Jimmy?<eos> I killed him, mom.<eos> He's dead.<eos> He won't ever bother us again.<eos> Oh, Mark! Oh...<eos> I want my Jimmy.<eos> He will never bother us again, okay?<eos> But I-I want my Jimmy.<eos> I do.
- Why are we just...<eos> - The door's locked.<eos> Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.<eos> Man, it's freezing in here.<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's it say?<eos> "Now you don't."
Why is that?<eos> Because he believes their magic was real.<eos> Oh, he believes the magic was real?<eos> You're right, he probably is useless.<eos> Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?<eos> I tried to give the money back, but they won't take it.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, let's just say you robbed a bank.<eos> - I did. - Fine.

You did.
Hey! Stop!<eos> Missing the trick. Again.<eos> Which was to make you think the safe had already been stolen, so you'd drop your guard and leave.<eos> Now, while you were busy playing with balloon animals, someone was breaking into the warehouse.<eos> Who?<eos> Jack Wilder.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> No. No way.<eos> He died right in front of my eyes.<eos> Unless, of course, he didn't.
- Took a few knocks?<eos> - I've had worse.<eos> So why did you level the house?<eos> Became just another place to hide - I'd rather see it burn.<eos> If it's any consolation, you're looking good.<eos> - Great outdoors.<eos> - Mm.<eos> What's that?<eos> Karen says I carry it off.<eos> Oh, does she now?
Wait, that's your propeller.<eos> You could still win the race.<eos> Oh, I intend to, but with my old propeller.<eos> This one didn't really suit me.<eos> But I think you will have a lot better luck with it.<eos> Thanks, Ishani.<eos> Dottie, can you fix me?<eos> Does a PT6A have a multi-stage compressor?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes it does.
And wine.<eos> Then I shall never leave.<eos> - Watch the...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And I didn't know how I could get rid of him.<eos> - And then what did you say?<eos> - Well, what I should have said was,<eos> "Mr. Andersen, though your Ugly Duckling has delighted,<eos> "you've slept in this room for five weeks now and you must go home."<eos> - But you did not.
Actually, this is a very bad time.<eos> It's time for my husband's nap.<eos> Dan, come on in for your nap.<eos> I understand, I'm so sorry to bother you.<eos> I just needed to ask you a few more questions.<eos> I answered all of your questions about her last time.<eos> I really don't know what you want me to say.<eos> - It's just a moment of your time...<eos> - You wanna bring some cherries home?<eos> - No, dear, he doesn't. No.
The water supplies section...<eos> Wash away the blood.<eos> Have you seen these kids?<eos> I don't know anything about...<eos> Where are they, you bitch?<eos> I don't know, I don't know, it's not me.<eos> Tell us or we'll cut your fucking arm off even shorter than mine ya bastard.<eos> Wilford knows.<eos> Wilford likes kids.<eos> He does.
What I don't understand is why I need to know this stuff.<eos> Seriously, like, who, like, calc-<eos> Coplanar lines and angles-<eos> Who calculates slopes at a job?<eos> - Aimee?<eos> - Who needs this shit?<eos> Come on out here right now, will ya.<eos> Thought you was gonna get us some milk.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do it now, for Christ's sake!
I just made that up because he's been gone for half my life... and... I guess I just miss him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No one knows where he is?<eos> Um, my mom knows where he is, but she won't tell me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She can't keep him from you.<eos> He's your dad.<eos> I know.<eos> She does.
People loved us.<eos> They loved you because you were little and cute.<eos> The guys liked you.<eos> They loved you.<eos> Thought you were a hot little muchacha. Mm-hmm.<eos> - You liked it.<eos> - Well-<eos> Yeah. Uh-huh.<eos> He did know how to make friends at least.<eos> Damn right, he did.
I really just came to see Jimmy's set-up, see what all the hype's about.<eos> Jimmy's set-up? Is that right?<eos> C'mon, mate.<eos> I am head shaper.<eos> Well, you're the only shaper, dickhead.<eos> I get him to put the bins out, sweep up, that kind of thing.<eos> - Keeps him off the streets.<eos> - Don't worry about him.<eos> - Reckons he taught me everything I know.<eos> - I did, mate.
I got on with everyone.<eos> Did you have a girl named Mousey at your school?<eos> No...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> Miss Merrick, I know what you've been through.<eos> I know it must have been extremely painful.<eos> I really need your help.<eos> Do you have any specific memory of Anna you think I should know?<eos> Yeah... sure I do.
Better than what you had before.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I just downloaded it.<eos> No, how did you leave me alone in the memory?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Suddenly I was back here, and our hands were separated, but you were still under.<eos> I wasn't sure what to do.<eos> You looked cute while you were sleeping.<eos> Anna, do you know what transference is?<eos> I do.
I want 30,000 now.<eos> - No fucking way. - Okay.<eos> Have a safe flight.<eos> What? No. Okay.<eos> Fine! Fine.<eos> Bloodsucker. Mm.<eos> All right, happy wife, happy life.<eos> Hi, kids!<eos> - Make room for your mother.<eos> No, I didn't...!
- No, I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I, um, really like your family.<eos> They're, uh...<eos> - They're different.<eos> - Well, they're not my family.<eos> I mean... Yeah, no, I get what you mean.<eos> - She wants him to kiss her.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - She does, right?
I take care of my kids.<eos> Who's watching them now?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Where's their daddy?<eos> He's in jail.<eos> What for?<eos> - Drugs.<eos> - So who pays your bills?<eos> The state does.<eos> Well, they did anyway.
Do you have any water? Any...<eos> Can-can you get me out of here?<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I think I already told you.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Does it fuckin' matter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
No, just wear it.<eos> So people don't have to worry about you.<eos> Yes, we're inviting ourselves.<eos> Accept it and move on.<eos> Peter does have to stay down below though.<eos> His eye throws off his equilibrium and he will get sick everywhere.<eos> No, I won't, Mom!<eos> Tell that to the bucket we have to bring!<eos> Mom, why do I have to wear this?<eos> Nobody else does.
I met her when she was catering some Halloween party in Albany.<eos> He went as a sexy cop.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> No. I went as a '70s, badass cop.<eos> Oh, he followed me around all night, saying that he was there to "protect and serve" me.<eos> That about ended it right there for me.<eos> Sadly, I would have been working his bag at that point.<eos> However, I do remember. You did let me help you pack your van at the end of the night.<eos> -Yes, I did.<eos> -Yes, you did.
Wait, wait.<eos> You knew about our records, so did the commissioner, right?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> But, this guy, you know, he's gonna make a stink with the whole city.<eos> So, I mean, what do you want with me?<eos> You said it was as good as done!<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what you said!<eos> Right? Right!<eos> I did.
I like the way Blair walks, like he's crossing a bridge.<eos> He's what this country needs.<eos> Yes it is.<eos> But i think we need to think about beyond this country.<eos> My work is here.<eos> Well, all you need to do is finish your PhD and then...<eos> We could pretty much live anywhere.<eos> People...<eos> -People have hearts everywhere.<eos> Yes, they do.
A woman who will live with her husband's mother and family.<eos> Someone from within the clan.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What are your feelings?<eos> I want to save people's lives.<eos> Hasnat, i asked about your feelings.<eos> I love you.<eos> But do you want us to be together inspite all of our problems?<eos> Do you want to make this work?<eos> Yes. I do.
- I had no idea that you could be so...<eos> - Sophisticated?<eos> Slutty.<eos> There are things on this list that I haven't even done, Brandy.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> So you're gonna scam on other guys and then hook up with Rusty?<eos> No offense, but how?<eos> You said yourself he's out of your league.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - I did.
It's Cameron.<eos> I don't think about him like that.<eos> But, you guys, he was... "prying-<eos> - I think I really hurt him.<eos> - Dude, he's just being a little baby.<eos> Guys mess around and girls just have to put up with it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's bullshit.<eos> When I sprained my ankle in gym class Duffy square danced with, like, three other girls.<eos> - He did not.
All summer everyone's been telling me to loosen up and relax and not think so much and...<eos> Well, fuck that.<eos> And fuck you too.<eos> - Want a beer?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, come on, don't look at me like that.<eos> Honey, can I speak with you?<eos> This whole thing has been so painful.<eos> Cameron was crying afterwards.<eos> They always do.
We're goin' to the whore house.<eos> Paradise.<eos> Cam, focus.<eos> Yeah, hey, I'm lookin'.<eos> Um, Give me the directions, bro.<eos> Yeah, I don't have that-- I don't have that paper.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I know, I said I had it.<eos> And I don't.
Come on, please.<eos> ...way that's gonna lead us to the scene of the crime.<eos> [Capri] How does it feel to have the camera in your face?<eos> Actually feels pretty good.<eos> [Capri] Okay, so tell me what's-- oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my God, oh.<eos> Oh, Graham, what the fuck?<eos> [Capri] Graham cracker, oh!<eos> Dude, I missed it, you gotta do it again.<eos> Just do it for the documentary.
Yeah, this is a big publicity stunt.<eos> The problem with people like you is, is that you get in people's heads.<eos> You're poisoning kids' minds.<eos> To tell the truth, my friends think you're crazy.<eos> Oh, I doubt that very much.<eos> - I'm sure they're all big fans. - Oh.<eos> - They're really big fans, Dad.<eos> - Now, what else did they...<eos> They don't think you're crazy.<eos> They don't.
We've already been over that territory, but here you are.<eos> Where are you in your dream?<eos> No place. A dream place. Fuzzy.<eos> Are you planning on going bowling?<eos> Bowling?<eos> Did you hit your head?<eos> What are your plans tomorrow?<eos> Levanna's birthday is Sunday, but tips are real good on a Sunday so I was gonna work it and celebrate her birthday tomorrow instead.<eos> A lot of people died in that dream of yours, huh Odd?<eos> Yeah, they did.
I rushed home but I already knew what I would find.<eos> How do you think they got into the pied-a'-terre?<eos> I left the window open, there was a grating. The thieves hooked the keys with a telescopic rod.<eos> - Is that just what you presume? - No.<eos> I saw it, they left it there.<eos> Listen, I'll have to ask you some personal questions.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Have you ever slept with the same man more than once?<eos> No. - I don't liked soup warmed up.<eos> - And how often do you do it?
Yes, one, but it's held by the board of the company.<eos> - You had your keys the whole time? - Yes.<eos> - How do you explain it, then?<eos> - What?<eos> That there's no sign of a break-in.<eos> How do I know?<eos> is it possible the thieves used the keys? - Yes.<eos> - Those of the board.<eos> - Who said that? . - What?<eos> You did, Mr Nicotra.
Thank you, sir.<eos> It's an honor to be here.<eos> If you play too loud, I'm walking out.<eos> Go ahead, guys.<eos> Anytime.<eos> - Well, there is something there. - ♪ Roxanne ♪<eos> - There is definitely something there. ♪ ...<eos> - ♪ Roxanne ♪ - ♪ Put on the red light ♪<eos> I opened CBGB because... I thought country music was gonna become the next big thing.<eos> And it did... in Nashville.
I think he was just holdin' on till I figured it out.<eos> Well, did you?<eos> Yes, son.<eos> I think I did.<eos> I should have brought you here before.<eos> Hey, look here.<eos> Look what I got.<eos> Look right here.<eos> He looks like Buffalo Bill.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Um... Did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, I was just worried.<eos> Okay, well, don't worry, I'm not gonna stalk you.<eos> It's funny, because I thought I was talking about what I wanted and, uh...<eos> - Yeah, you were. - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I wanna hear what you were saying.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is the sheik.<eos> Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his lawyer.<eos> Are we still okay to wire the money?<eos> Simone can take the wire. What's the number?<eos> 531... 531... 76. 76.<eos> The funds are transferred.<eos> The funds have transferred.<eos> The money's been wired.<eos> I think we have a deal.<eos> Yes, we do, sir.
- Why would I do that?<eos> - Robbie said he drove you home.<eos> Emphasis on "drove."<eos> - And you believed him?<eos> - Well, not at first, but I figured I was just being delusional.<eos> - Robbie doesn't know anything about driving.<eos> But you do.<eos> - No. No, no.<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
They both believed in an alternative version of reality.<eos> - What reality?<eos> - You're not the first to have seen one of the dahl twins.<eos> Jenny mcadams was the first.<eos> She told susie childs.<eos> Susie told nancy fitz.<eos> And before you knew it, all three claimed to have seen one of the twins.<eos> - But I just found out they existed an hour ago.<eos> Nobody told me anything.<eos> - I did.
- Anne's out of her mind.<eos> Go.<eos> I said go.<eos> - It's locked.<eos> - It shouldn't be.<eos> - Well, it is.<eos> - Try harder.<eos> - I did.<eos> You said you were gonna let me go.<eos> - I just did.
And I've ordered everything, you just have to pick up the chicken.<eos> And I will stop and get the famous bean salad on my way home.<eos> Ah, the famous bean salad.<eos> Is that horrible Woolf woman going to be there?<eos> Helen is the preeminent Virginia Woolf scholar.<eos> It was quite a coup to get her from Cambridge.<eos> But I think she has other plans.<eos> Lovely and wonderful.<eos> Oh, I like this life.<eos> I do, I do.
I don't know.<eos> She's weird.<eos> She is indeed.<eos> Doesn't matter anyway.<eos> Right?<eos> Sure it matters.<eos> But about this Spanish test.<eos> This is your third "try harder" in a row.<eos> Se帽ora Garcia says you have an aptitude for languages.<eos> What if I don't?
And I don't want to hurt them 'cause they're my parents.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh. This whole time, you thought you were my mother?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't want anything to get in the way of you getting into Princeton.<eos> I'd have to recuse myself and...<eos> So everything you did was because you thought I was your son?<eos> No.<eos> I completely believe in you!<eos> I actually do.
That nourishes our soul<eos> Nobody showed up.<eos> Sweetheart, I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I desperately tried to get there, but Mickey was having a bad day<eos> -and your father was just...<eos> -GG!<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How many times do I...
I say we pray to them all just to be fair.<eos> -So, as I was saying...<eos> -I have an announcement.<eos> From now on I want to be called "Thor."<eos> Thor?<eos> Like the comic book?<eos> No, the Norse God of thunder.<eos> I was going to with Poseidon but Thor just hits, you know.<eos> Doesn't Thor like have a hammer or something?<eos> -Yeah, he does.
A million dollars.<eos> Can you beat that?<eos> Let's raise a glass to Kate and Woody, here.<eos> To Kate and Woody!<eos> Not to be a spoilsport, but you all know this is bull.<eos> I mean, Dad didn't win anything.<eos> Nice try, Ross.<eos> Yeah, we're way beyond that.<eos> Ross is right.<eos> He didn't.
Bald men are so sey.<eos> Virile.<eos> Wow. She's cute.<eos> Where did you find her?<eos> Nebraska?<eos> Kansas.<eos> Kansas.<eos> So what was it you wanted to talk to me about?<eos> I would like to believe that the US didn't plant... a weapon of mass destruction in Moscow.<eos> But I don't.
No.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> THIS IS RED SQUARE 20 MINUTES AGO<eos> SECURITY SWEEP THE BUILDING, GET THE ARMY NOW<eos> One more time.<eos> Great.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> "Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."<eos> Good. And then they'll move on.<eos> What if they don't?
It's early, go have a seat.<eos> - What are you drinking?<eos> - Scotch. Scotch.<eos> Excuse me, sweetheart. Can you get a scotch for my friend?<eos> Somebody hacked into our mailing list.<eos> I left New Orleans Monday night.<eos> A day later everything changed.<eos> That's when I met Aya.<eos> All my life I've charged into things without thinking.<eos> Doing some pretty dumb stuff.
Doing some pretty dumb stuff.<eos> But I want to get something right.<eos> I'm not going to throw the towel in this time.<eos> Not on you.<eos> I left New Orleans Monday night.<eos> A day later everything changed.<eos> I can't believe you did all this.<eos> I couldn't leave town, not without one last dance.<eos> - End this now!<eos> - I already did.
We have plenty of room.<eos> I know, I know, and...<eos> It's a very generous offer.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I'll come and stay for a few weeks until David is back to himself again.<eos> - Ma.<eos> - No!<eos> You hold your breath.<eos> You know where you get that stubborn streak from, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
You are not to blame for what happened to Grandpa.<eos> The truck that hit you... The tire blew out.<eos> You had nothing to do with that.<eos> The driver tried to keep from swerving.<eos> He couldn't.<eos> I think I'm tired now, Dad.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> That highway should have had a center barrier, man.<eos> It didn't.
Tell him to go!<eos> Listen, we've been working on this project for months.<eos> Julian thinks it could be the most important leak we've ever had.<eos> - He just got off the plane.<eos> - Listen to yourself!<eos> Why do you try so hard to be him?<eos> What?<eos> You'll never be him.<eos> He's got nowhere else to stay.<eos> Well, I do.
The one who helps you distinguish fact from fiction.<eos> WikiLeaks has hundreds of volunteers.<eos> It's very difficult to keep track of any single one.<eos> Well, do try to keep track of me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, what's this new leak you're sitting on?<eos> It must be big if it's piqued the interest of the CIA.<eos> So, you do believe me?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I didn't.
Yes, that's better.<eos> That's much better.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's better.<eos> That's much better.<eos> Getting cold in here!<eos> Yes we are. Yes we are.<eos> Gonna get those feet!<eos> I got your toes. I got your toes.<eos> Yes I do.
That's why I have this tattoo on my arm.<eos> It's the first and only decision she got to make for me, what to name me.<eos> My dad thinks it's probably the name of some boy she had fling with when she spent a semester in Paris.<eos> But he went along with it anyway.<eos> Stupid.<eos> I like it.<eos> The tattoo.<eos> It's kind of badass, like you.<eos> You think I'm badass.<eos> Yeah. I do.
There's some more in here if you'd like to have a look.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on in.<eos> So you'd consider yourself a California artist?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm more of an all-over kind of guy.<eos> Army brat, third generation.<eos> I signed up before they could draft me.<eos> Well, you made it back okay.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Join your crew?<eos> It's just that you guys are, you know, kind of slow-ish.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Really?<eos> To our faces?<eos> Theo, what are you doing?<eos> Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear what I clearly just heard.<eos> Heard what?<eos> I didn't hear anything.<eos> Nothing out of order, did you, Theo?
Boom!<eos> Check out my well-designed endorsement poster.<eos> What's your point, Tito?<eos> My point is, we got a chance to change our lives for the better.<eos> To make Starlight Plaza the great place we all know it could be.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Who's ready to sponsor the next Indy 500 champion?<eos> Sorry, Tito, but I've got work to do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of you do.
Fuck that guy!<eos> You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.<eos> You're Samson's bloodline.<eos> You have to be the one to give the ghost what it wants.<eos> The fuck I do.<eos> You can't bring me back there!<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> The one who caused the ghost death is the only one who can make it right.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> But your father did.
And in the United States, .004% of the population share this affliction.<eos> Big Doug had us all in for physicals.<eos> Hemolytic anemia is-- well, it's when the red blood cells rupture and become dysfunctional.<eos> Extremely painful condition.<eos> Well, you see, I need clean blood, Thomas.<eos> But to find a compatible donor, it's highly unlikely.<eos> It's almost impossible, in fact.<eos> Imagine my surprise at finding one in my own stable.<eos> Doug know he was sending me into this?<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
I've asked around about your friend Isabel.<eos> Hoe'd you knoe about Isabel?<eos> Last night, don't you remember?<eos> Did I come here last night?<eos> Do something stupid?<eos> You said you'd had some luck.<eos> "God," you said.<eos> You don't believe?<eos> So hoe do you explain those nee clothes?<eos> I don't.
- Ecstatic. Yöu're the perfect couple.<eos> Hey there.<eos> How are yöu? Fine, hoping yöu'd pay us a visit.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't want to bother yöu yet. Besides, I'm a bit jealous.<eos> Yöu're taking my soul mate.<eos> So take care of her for me.<eos> Carla, yöu're never a bother, and the guest room is always yöurs, yöu know that.<eos> I'll take yöu up on that.<eos> Do it.
That's near Pensacola?<eos> Nicer than Glades from the outside, but the tiers were shit.<eos> I used to work out of the Miami office.<eos> Didn't get up north much.<eos> Yeah, I grew up down near Glades...<eos> West of Belle Glade, out near Immolakee.<eos> Prefer it up north, though.<eos> Better class of people, by and large.<eos> You move up north once you started fighting?<eos> - You ever do any?
Here's the deal.<eos> Don't ask me any questions because I'm only going to tell you what I want to tell you.<eos> The man who calls himself Rodrigo took something from me.<eos> He's in business with three other men.<eos> They're here for a robbery and they're gonna use that house to lay low when they're done.<eos> So... You let them steal something, you steal it from them.<eos> I help you and I get a commission.<eos> You're going to kill them, aren't you?<eos> I never said that, Leslie.<eos> You did.
- When I was a camper..um..<eos> They called the island, Goat Island. And I was marooned, and ... And ...<eos> I was a goat. I was scared at first, but it all worked out.<eos> See.<eos> - We have to find her, you understand that?<eos> - Absolutely<eos> We have to find her right now!<eos> The Sheriff office, the local police and the county juvenile division are all engaged in a coordinate effort to secure your daughter's safety.<eos> - I understand how you must be feeling.<eos> - No. You don't.
- Grace? - Mom!<eos> Thanks for coming so fast.<eos> Lockwood's honey stand is out near the county's bridge.<eos> It's not far. Ok.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Mom said said to wait where we were. Near the honey stand.<eos> She promised me that you could come home with us.<eos> - No, she didn't mean it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Yes, she did.
She promised me that you could come home with us.<eos> - No, she didn't mean it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> - She couldn't! It's against the law!<eos> - What is?<eos> - Us.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Did they say anything about my parents coming?<eos> No, she didn't.
That's the Fire and Police Department.<eos> If the Hive goes down, this whole city goes dark.<eos> Question here.<eos> Why do they call it the Hive?<eos> Listen. Hear all those little worker bees?<eos> Hey, what about Max?<eos> You know he wants to bone you, right?<eos> Oh, my God, Autumn.<eos> Stop it, that's disgusting.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Why?<eos> What for?<eos> If you ever need your own space, or you just want to get away from Larry or Steve, it's there for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, funny enough, Larry's the reason I go home.<eos> I don't want to leave him alone with my mother.<eos> Steve just doesn't understand that.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to protect your mother.<eos> Every daughter does.
Right. Hey, I'm glad I caught you.<eos> We're having a singles' barbecue at the church this Saturday.<eos> You should come.<eos> I'm not single, though.<eos> I'm just happy.<eos> I thought you weren't seeing anyone.<eos> Right.<eos> Happily.<eos> So you'll think about it?<eos> I just did.
Would you like to make a confession?<eos> Confession for what?<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Captain.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Mr. First Officer.<eos> Do you know what's going on?<eos> Sophi baked us some tea cakes.<eos> you realize that we're supposed to sail this thing.<eos> - Yes, I do.
My watch stopped.<eos> There's somebody out there.<eos> They found us.<eos> They're raising the boat.<eos> This is a restricted area, Captain.<eos> This was my boat.<eos> And this is my captain's family.<eos> Apparently the Americans showed self-discipline.<eos> We didn't make it, did we?<eos> No, son, we didn't.
I'm afraid so.<eos> Have you really never set eyes on her?<eos> Just once.<eos> What's she like?<eos> I suppose feeling a certain interest in a person necessarily engenders a conviction that she's beautiful.<eos> Up to a point.<eos> It's her birthday in two days.<eos> I'd like to get her something useful.<eos> Yeah. I don't think useful is probably your best approach.<eos> - You don't?
-No, no...<eos> No, it's better this way.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Yes?<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> I remember.<eos> I remember where I put it.<eos> -You don't have to tell me.<eos> -No, no. I do.
- Where the hell is this going?<eos> About a year ago, my client's wife of 10 years left him.<eos> Busted my ass for that woman.<eos> Gave her everything she ever wanted.<eos> So you married an ungrateful bitch.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> After his wife abandoned him, my client divulged his extreme feelings to your department shrink.<eos> News flash, asshole.<eos> He didn't rape his wife.<eos> Didn't he?
You ever seen this man?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I met him.<eos> Zhanna brought him by.<eos> I thought all the men in her life are losers, but she said he was different.<eos> They were going to get clean together.<eos> They met at the club.<eos> I didn't like it, but I guess it was a better way to support her habit than selling her body on the street.<eos> Do you know if Zhanna kept a journal?<eos> She did.
- I know you?<eos> No, you don't know me, but I know you.<eos> Take it.<eos> There's plenty more where that came from.<eos> What the fuck do you want?<eos> How much money you want to spend?<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Scottsdale?<eos> I don't even know where that is.<eos> Nobody else does either.
I told you.<eos> I had to retake an exam.<eos> No, that's not what you said on the phone last night.<eos> We didn't talk on the phone last night.<eos> Yes, we did, when I told you about Brink.<eos> We didn't talk about that.<eos> Agustin just told me about the stupid fight you guys had last night.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> No, we didn't.
Hey, baby!<eos> This freak grabbed me!<eos> He told me I rubbed my pussy in his face!<eos> She did!<eos> She did!<eos> Whatever!<eos> She didn't, man.<eos> She did!<eos> I swear she did!<eos> She did not, okay?
This freak grabbed me!<eos> He told me I rubbed my pussy in his face!<eos> She did!<eos> She did!<eos> Whatever!<eos> She didn't, man.<eos> She did!<eos> I swear she did!<eos> She did not, okay?<eos> Okay, she didn't.
She didn't, man.<eos> She did!<eos> I swear she did!<eos> She did not, okay?<eos> Okay, she didn't.<eos> Fucking asshole!<eos> Alicia.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I didn't!<eos> - She did.
But, you know, I couldn't stand being ignored.<eos> I ignored you?<eos> You didn't need a soothsayer to know that you were terrified of being alone with me.<eos> I'm sorry, Don.<eos> Really, I am.<eos> Just, you know, with the children gone,<eos> I guess I didn't think we had much in common anymore.<eos> Yeah, so we picked up another kid to avoid the issue.<eos> You know, I tried to stick it out.<eos> I really did.
- Shut up and we'll talk.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Look at him.<eos> The Terminator.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> He came from the future to fuck us all up the ass.<eos> Marc Delgado.<eos> I'm sure you know why I'm here.<eos> Yes, we all do.
- Did you see the Japanese kid?<eos> - What?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you.<eos> To find my girlfriend.<eos> And?<eos> I need a GPS to navigate down there.<eos> Any cell phone has GPS.<eos> They all use cell phone towers which don't work anymore.<eos> But the satellites still do.
"and his faithfulness continues through all generations."<eos> Psalms 100, verse 5.<eos> I'm going to keep you away from that school.<eos> You can't.<eos> We'll pray.<eos> We'll pray together.<eos> To save our women-weak, wicked, sinning souls.<eos> You didn't tell me and they laughed.<eos> I didn't sin, you sinned.<eos> I did not.
It's Tommy Ross.<eos> Wow. Tommy Ross?<eos> He is pretty dreamy, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know who he goes around with.<eos> They're just going to trick me again.<eos> Right?<eos> Maybe he really meant it.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, of course he did.
She's in the next room.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> I hope the walls are thick.<eos> She hasn't gotten up for a while.<eos> How long's a while?<eos> A few weeks.<eos> Is that how long your dad's been gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They always go out with a bang, don't they?<eos> Yes, they do.
No, it's just...<eos> I was thinking about those birthday hats that you always used to make me... and I was thinking about how I never appreciated them much... and thought maybe I could've been a nicer kid.<eos> No.<eos> I should've been a better mother.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Your dad was kind of a hippie when he was young.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> That photo of him upstairs, he's all normal and dad-like.<eos> I wonder why people do that.<eos> - Do what? - Change.
Thank you.<eos> - Would you like a drop?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - How's the voice?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It was a bit hoarse when I woke up this morning, yeah.<eos> It doesn't sound hoarse.<eos> And, more importantly, you don't look like a horse.<eos> Yeah, you certainly don't.
I bought them for your mummy.<eos> For your mummy and you, and your little sister.<eos> - I don't want them.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I want my mummy.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Now, this... this is my favourite.<eos> - Do you own it?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Hey! No! No!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Doug is my insurance.<eos> He stays with me.<eos> You don't give me Chow, I blow his brains out.<eos> You go to the cops I blow his brains out.<eos> That's insane!<eos> We don't even know where the fuck he is!<eos> No one does.
Asked me what?<eos> Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia.<eos> You are a strangely dislikeable person.<eos> But you do have your virtues.<eos> Would you like some bread, Katniss?<eos> No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You two have a lot of warming up to do before show time.<eos> Which is in an hour, so take a bath, Haymitch.<eos> I just did.
Send message.<eos> What came over you yesterday?<eos> It just happened.<eos> One thing led to another.<eos> - I thought it was quite a big thing.<eos> - Why did it scare you?<eos> Your fanaticism scared me.<eos> Such a bastard.<eos> He wasn't too bad, I thought.<eos> I didn't.
He actually fired a man today.<eos> - He told you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - He came home all emotional.<eos> - Why?<eos> The man he sacked was once a friend of his.<eos> But recently he turned into an unreliable bastard.<eos> Unreliable bastard.<eos> - Did he say that?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Blonde model Suzy Hunt stepped on to the dizzy Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton roundabout of romance yesterday.<eos> Is that from him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So when did all this start?<eos> That weekend I went skiing.<eos> Why have you come here, James?<eos> I've got to get you back.<eos> You don't want me back.<eos> You never wanted to be married in the first place.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Meantime, native sons born of the red, white and blue are left broken, snuffling for your crumbs!<eos> You're broke, you dumb shit, because you never went to college.<eos> Thereby guaranteeing you were going to spend the rest of your life obsessing over pectoral muscles.<eos> Why'd you say that?<eos> Why'd you say that, you piece of shit, about pectoral muscles?<eos> Fucking tell me now!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> What's going on is this dude seems to think he knows who the fuck I am!<eos> No, I don't, I don't.
Start the fucking car and go!<eos> Back over him.<eos> Get it over quick.<eos> It's like ripping off a Band-Aid.<eos> Just do it!<eos> Don't make Pepe suffer.<eos> No!<eos> I knew you could do it, Paul.<eos> You just killed a man.<eos> We did.
No, I can do it.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Come on, let me help.<eos> L.-<eos> Ed!<eos> There you go.<eos> Every man needs to fight for his dignity.<eos> I have a boat.<eos> I have a boat.<eos> Sure you do.
May cause anxiety, aggression, seizure, suicidal thoughts, dementia...<eos> I feel like shit now.<eos> Jesus, forgive me.<eos> Forgive my sins.<eos> We're back!<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You can do that shit all day in prison if we don't get these bodies out of here!<eos> I am in the middle of a superset.<eos> Hey! Did you take the wedding ring?<eos> No, I did not.
Everyone that wants the American dream.<eos> All I ever wanted out of life was what everyone else had.<eos> Not more.<eos> Just not the less I was used to.<eos> Well, I took a real swing for it, you know?<eos> And for a while, it was like I always thought it would be.<eos> I was one of you.<eos> And it felt good.<eos> People finally saw me like I saw myself and you can't ask for more than that.<eos> Maybe I did, though.
As excuses go, it's not terrible.<eos> But I saw you on TV. You were in New York!<eos> Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world but I was wrong.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> But I believe that fate brought us together.<eos> Jane, I don't know where you were, or what happened, but I do know this...<eos> What?<eos> I know...<eos> You do?<eos> Do what?
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness.<eos> But, after eternities of bloodshed my father Bor finally triumphed ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.<eos> What happened?<eos> He killed them all.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them, and yet here it is.<eos> The Dark Elves are dead.<eos> Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?<eos> No.<eos> It does not.
Did she suffer?<eos> I did not come here to share our grief.<eos> Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.<eos> Go on.<eos> I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.<eos> You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.<eos> Vengeance and afterward, this cell.<eos> You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.<eos> What makes you think you can trust me?<eos> I don't.

Why don't you try out some of that fancy talk?<eos> Mr. Nobley, I hear there is a ball on our last night.<eos> Do you enjoy dancing?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Scandalous.<eos> I am sure you have escorted many a fine lady on to the dance floor.<eos> I would say that manners maketh man.<eos> I look forward to having the pleasure of standing opposite you.<eos> But dancing is the true hallmark...<eos> You do?
As far as you are concerned, lam Miss Erstwhile.<eos> I mean, it's so embarrassing.<eos> What, do you keep a supply of pregnant horses just laying around or something?<eos> What?<eos> You're not a vet!<eos> I did a biology class at school.<eos> Come on, you were acting, too.<eos> Look, before you go and make your report, you should know, gorgeous,<eos> that what we had was real.<eos> No, you didn't.
You see, I am merely a hologram of the real Chester V.<eos> The United Nations has asked me and my Thinkquanauts to assist in the cleanup and containment of the leftovers all over the world.<eos> Including your Swallow Falls.<eos> We'll get started on the cleanup right away.<eos> As soon as you all leave.<eos> What?<eos> You need us to leave?<eos> Listen up, ghost man you expect us to skedaddle from our homes because of some nasty leftovers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
- No shit. Let's get outta here. No.<eos> That teddy bear didn't just get up there by itself. Someone kidnapped that girl.<eos> That's what kidnappers do. Listen you have to call the police.<eos> I don't want to get any trouble.<eos> Let's just get outta here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Julie.<eos> - Did you hear that? - No.<eos> - Well, it sounded like somebody's crying.<eos> - No, it didn't.
Fuck off.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Fuck off. Okay, big boy.<eos> Move on.<eos> If she's here, we'll find her.<eos> I'll look around a couple more hours.<eos> Mrs. Morehead?<eos> Sergeant Halcombe.<eos> I was told you had some information about your sister.<eos> I do.
- How did you get away?<eos> - In the car.<eos> I was...<eos> I was looking out the window and he was fixing the seat in the back of the plane.<eos> That's how I ran.<eos> And he didn't wore no rubber and I was on my period at the time, and I had a tampon in my womb.<eos> I kept it in me because I thought that if there was any chance that I was getting out of there, i needed evidence.<eos> And that was the fucking evidence... his semen.<eos> And I thought if there was any way that I would... would escape, that he wasn't getting away with it.<eos> But he did.
Look, you think maybe he was having some kind of spasm, some kind of reaction to the drug he took?<eos> Look, no.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> Can you recall making any movements to strike or push him when he was convulsing?<eos> Is that how it happened?<eos> No, I-- No.<eos> I just ran.<eos> I don't know what happened...<eos> And you didn't take the drug?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Make a wish.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Bravo!<eos> That's great.<eos> One lungful.<eos> I made you this, Daddy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look at that.<eos> - Did you see that, Mommy?<eos> - I did.
I know it's somewhere in there!<eos> Patsey!<eos> Pats!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where the Pats?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where the Pats'?<eos> Whatcha just standing there?<eos> We know nothin' of her, Massa.<eos> - The hell you don't!
Don't be scared.<eos> Don't be scared. Don't be scared.<eos> Don't be scared, baby.<eos> Daddy.<eos> It's me, honey.<eos> But...<eos> You died.<eos> No.<eos> I just had to find you.<eos> Before they did.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.<eos> Don't be scared, baby.<eos> Daddy.<eos> It's me, honey.<eos> But...<eos> You died.<eos> No.<eos> I just had to find you.<eos> Before they did.<eos> Before he did.
- Three!<eos> - We're done!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - What the hell is going on?<eos> - Girl's got a demon in her!<eos> - Screw you!<eos> She does.
- Stop!<eos> - What the hell is going on?<eos> - Girl's got a demon in her!<eos> - Screw you!<eos> She does.<eos> We all have pasts we wish we could undo, kiddo.<eos> But I hope you know, in your heart, that that video is not you.<eos> It ain't real.<eos> Those people, that cult, what they did, that doesn't define you.<eos> Only your actions do.
- No.<eos> I'm gonna screw up, Norman. I know it.<eos> You can't play charts like these without fudging a note here and there. So what?<eos> If you're going to start playing carefully, I'll just go get the wine and cheese.<eos> Do you want to be the thousandth guy to give me a respectable Bach?<eos> Because you can keep that.<eos> I don't need respectable.<eos> If you're going to play music this dense, you're going to hit a wrong note.<eos> And they won't know.<eos> They never do.
You sniveling little piece of shit.<eos> You think this is some kind of a game?<eos> I'll rip your throat out, goddamn it.<eos> You sniveling little piece of shit!<eos> Are you listening to me, Tom?<eos> You knew that was the wrong note.<eos> You knew it!<eos> Yes. But the audience didn't.<eos> What the hell do you mean?<eos> They never do.
Do you really want to talk about this right now?<eos> Honestly? I said I was sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. It makes no sense.<eos> He just left you here? - I don't understand.<eos> - Elly saw us kissing.<eos> Elly was so mad at me, and Bobby was so forceful.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean he was forceful?<eos> He didn't rape you, did he?<eos> No, he didn't rape me.<eos> No worse than you do, Adam.
- Yeah.<eos> - We'll be touring, right?<eos> - Touring Uranus.<eos> I'll get my vaccinations.<eos> Sign where?<eos> - You are AF of M, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sign there and there.<eos> You don't have a label?<eos> Uh, I do.
Well, we've always wanted a boat.<eos> Can't believe this is happening, right, honey?<eos> No, not hungry.<eos> Are we almost there?<eos> We must be in Wyoming by now, coming up on the Dakotas.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Half an hour, maybe.<eos> He's pretty out there.<eos> I thought you said he lived close.<eos> He does.
I don't think you would use a man as a disguise?<eos> What about the artist?<eos> Lonely and recluse at her multimillion dollar estate?<eos> Is what makes sense for you to side with a man... you're helpless... you don't like violence...<eos> I could be a guy.<eos> It doesn't say here that any of these guys are gay.<eos> Why would I have to be gay?<eos> To enjoy fucking the other guy! ?<eos> I could be faking it!<eos> Maybe you did.
Even... even with all my genius, I couldn't begin to imagine the chaos if even one more person used this.<eos> There are no exceptions.<eos> Al would tell you the same thing.<eos> You have to go back now and destroy it.<eos> There's nothing wrong with the technology.<eos> Nothing. Listen... listen, I've been very, very careless.<eos> I realize that now. I've been talking to strangers, even. I'm going to stay down here the entire time.<eos> Mom died because of this.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Of course it does!
He'd keep it close by.<eos> You know where it is.<eos> Don't you think I would have told that psychopath anything I knew once he put his hands on me?<eos> Chad likes the rough stuff.<eos> Ryan too, actually.<eos> Was that it?<eos> Was that your thing?<eos> I'm not judging.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> See, actually, I do.
I'm going to wait inside.<eos> No, no.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Take the chair inside, please.<eos> How's your neck?<eos> Just say what you need to say and leave me alone.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Did you lie to Jason about the play?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
About the play.<eos> I wasn't a great dad.<eos> Pushed him to do all the things I wanted him to do.<eos> I'm sure, you did your best.<eos> I dated some crazy women.<eos> None of them Irish.<eos> But, uh...<eos> - Creative license, I guess. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Anyway, we learn from our mistakes, right?<eos> Yes, we do.
I've seen... a lot of suffering.<eos> You can do something if you know what's wrong.<eos> I'm sorry I can't help you play Florence Nightingale.<eos> But a lot of men went through something you can't even begin to imagine.<eos> You're going to have to let us just get on and cope with it as best we can.<eos> My husband isn't coping.<eos> He's a mess.<eos> War leaves a mark, Mrs Lomax.<eos> But I don't believe in this code of silence that you have.<eos> I really don't.
- Here, here, here. - Look at me, you will be okay.<eos> It's water.<eos> Easy now.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> You people know each other?<eos> You just need to breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hey, who are you, man?<eos> I don't remember who I am.<eos> None of us do.
How is that shit?<eos> I killed a bumblebee today.<eos> How will we...<eos> Gangster!<eos> You!<eos> Yin and yang, What the fuck you all smoking?<eos> This amazing weed we got from manny.<eos> It's new, it's called black forest high.<eos> Manny said, he's dropping the other stuff.<eos> He did, huh?
Tastes like shit.<eos> Costs, like, twice the price.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> The high is like, twice as nice.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Give me the fucking joint.<eos> We came to the decision earlier today That we are not gonna be sharing any of the...<eos> Oh, yeah you will be sharing.<eos> Yeah, man, have a toke.<eos> Well, everyone does.
Costs, like, twice the price.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> The high is like, twice as nice.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Give me the fucking joint.<eos> We came to the decision earlier today That we are not gonna be sharing any of the...<eos> Oh, yeah you will be sharing.<eos> Yeah, man, have a toke.<eos> Well, everyone does.<eos> Yeah, we all do.
Sorry, I know you can't kiss on the mouth in public.<eos> It againsts the law.<eos> - It is not.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Oh!<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> A little gone away present.<eos> You do not know what this means.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do.
Can I take your coats?<eos> Oh.<eos> How nice.<eos> Okay, this is off.<eos> What a beautiful dress.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> So polite.<eos> Do you have a baby in there?<eos> Yes, I do.
Hold on.<eos> Kennedy, please stop eating!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What do you know about this?<eos> I know a lot more than you do.<eos> You have a child?<eos> I don't need to have a child in order to know how to deal with a child.<eos> I know how to deal with a child.<eos> No, you don't!
Candace!<eos> Keisha!<eos> Kelly!<eos> Girls!<eos> Candace, wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> Why?<eos> Everyone already knows I'm a ghetto-ass dick-sucking, stripping ho!<eos> Yes!<eos> We do.
Not really.<eos> You talk to Candace?<eos> Text.<eos> I hate texts.<eos> How's Kennedy?<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Despite how bad a mother I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I did.
You can tell me.<eos> She left a suicide note and it blamed me for basically everything.<eos> The thing was printed off the computer.<eos> I was married to that woman for 16 years and I never once saw her use that computer.<eos> Sometimes I think about stalling over again.<eos> Finding a new woman to share my life with have another kid.<eos> Try and do it right this time.<eos> We never do get a second chance... to fix the big fuck-ups in our lives, do we?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't
You want to get some food?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> David, we're okay to close up without Bess, aren't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Bess, go on.<eos> You want one from the margarita side or one from the pepperoni side?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Yeah, me, neither.<eos> Scott Norris thinks you're a freak.<eos> Everyone does, except for me.
Al, I'm going to pull a car over.<eos> Speak to you tomorrow.<eos> Licence, please.<eos> Hi, simone.<eos> -Where are you all off to?<eos> -Book club.<eos> - What you reading?<eos> - Blue velvet.<eos> -Thought it was a film.<eos> -We're doing the book version.
There was a lot of partying in those days.<eos> The road to town was bad, sometimes impassable.<eos> There was a bit of mucking around.<eos> Whether you like it or not, this is where it all began for you.<eos> With my seed.<eos> It was all secret.<eos> There was a few tears from her, And then, lo and behold, all these years later, here you are.<eos> All grown up.<eos> Kind of puts a different light on things, doesn't it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Like basketball?<eos> No, like Bernard Ball.<eos> That's his name.<eos> Stay right here, right next to him.<eos> - Why?<eos> - So no one messes with you.<eos> - Can't I come with you, Mister?<eos> - Hell, no!<eos> Why is he staring at you like that?<eos> He always does that.
It could take several hours or days.<eos> - Maybe the rest of his life if he has bad luck.<eos> - We leave him and the suitcase behind.<eos> I don't give 50 million back to someone who doesn't even know that he had them.<eos> There is a limit.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Listen, never mind about the fucking hello.<eos> - What exactly are you up to there, Gäddan?<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes, I do.
I know your name.<eos> It isn't Cole.<eos> It's Litchfield.<eos> Matthew Litchfield.<eos> Yes. He was my father.<eos> A wicked man, Captain Hastings.<eos> He was our jailer until my sister Margaret...<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> It was in all the papers.<eos> But you don't.
Is it possible, do you think, that Sir George Stubbs felt the attractions to Madame Legge?<eos> Good heavens, no.<eos> Sir George is extremely fond of his wife.<eos> Was it you or Lady Stubbs who asked Miss Brewis to take jam tarts down to the girl in the boathouse?<eos> Goodness.<eos> All these questions.<eos> I remember Miss Brewis collecting some cakes but I don't recall that anyone asked her to do so.<eos> You were serving in the tea tent between four and five o'clock.<eos> I believe Mrs Legge came in there at that time for her tea?<eos> No, she didn't.
She knows even before the death of Marlene Tucker that the world it is a place most wicked.<eos> What is there that she does not know?<eos> Monsieur Legge...<eos> You are leaving Nasse House?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sally's cleared out.<eos> Non. With that bastard Weyman.<eos> I do not think she will be as happy with him as she would be with you.<eos> You think so, do you?<eos> Yes, I do, Monsieur.
And you also know his wife Sally Legge but she is not Yugoslavian, is she?<eos> So what gives to you the idea of having a wife who is Yugoslavian for the victim? Oh, I don't know.<eos> All those youth hostellers perhaps.<eos> All those girls in shorts.<eos> But, madame, I am most interested in how you write.<eos> You are a woman who is most sensitive.<eos> You are affected by the atmosphere, by the personalities that surround you.<eos> These are the inspirations for your brain that is so fertile.<eos> So tell to me, madame, when you first designed your murder hunt, did you intend for the body to be discovered in the boathouse?<eos> No, I did not. Ah.
Yeah.<eos> OK, I'm sorry. Er...<eos> I went home.<eos> I didn't see any of the other girls.<eos> I had sardines on toast.<eos> And then I went to bed.<eos> So nobody can corroborate your story.<eos> I guess not.<eos> It is strange that Dr Willoughby also has no alibi for the night in question.<eos> He doesn't?
You say Professor Willoughby was retired.<eos> I said semi-retired.<eos> Did he come to the institute every day?<eos> My father kept to his own timetable.<eos> Which was, I concede, erratic.<eos> He'd work all night and sleep all day if it suited him.<eos> Was he married?<eos> My mother passed away some years ago.<eos> - Never remarried?<eos> Some gentlemen do.
Six months ago.<eos> On the SS "France".<eos> So you were still living in Boston in March of this year.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you remember what you were doing on the 17th?<eos> The 17th of March?<eos> Oui.<eos> - How am I expected to remember that?<eos> - You do not recall this day?<eos> No. I don't.
Young people today, they rush into things!<eos> But it's important to know the background, don't you think?<eos> The psychological background.<eos> Well, there are certain... risks that one might not wish to take.<eos> But the persons taking these risks are Celia and Desmond, not you, madame.<eos> 399 your pardon?<eos> Desmond, he is not your son by birth.<eos> What's that got to do with anything?<eos> When he was young, did you take care of him?<eos> Of course I did!
She's a...<eos> She's a devious little baggage!<eos> And I made jolly sure to intercept her letters later on.<eos> He's my son and I will say what happens to him!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Five minutes till the start of the recital!<eos> - Mademoiselle Celia.<eos> - Poirot.<eos> Mademoiselle, do you know, and please to forgive me, how it was that Aunt Dorothea died?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hold this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to kiss you.<eos> - Goodbye, Dorothea.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Hell, I expect.<eos> This is for Margaret.<eos> And this is for me.<eos> He had to keep his promise to his wife.<eos> And he did.
This (BLEEP) is (BLEEP) up, right?<eos> What did you say the name of this acting class was again?<eos> Method One Clinic.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.<eos> "Garden Grove Methodone Clinic."<eos> And moments later, as Lindsay, once again, found herself questioning her husband's choices, one of hers was questioned.<eos> That's not Free Trade, and if it's not Free Trade, it's (BLEEP).<eos> - I wouldn't...<eos> You don't look like a junkie.<eos> You do.
I have, like, a good statement to say about this.<eos> She could speak generally.<eos> I think this situation was attracted into my life... as a huge learning lesson for me... to grow and expand as a spiritual human being.<eos> I believe that I am an old soul.<eos> You are, honey.<eos> She is.<eos> We've gotten to know Nicki and her family... and we believe that she is an extremely focused and honest young woman... who has a lot to offer the community.<eos> And we agree that there has not been a disconnect- that there were circumstances that happened... but Nicki herself has continued to stay on her plane... despite the tumultuous experiences happening.<eos> What's your goal, or life plan, if you have one?<eos> I do.
Sorry.<eos> I don't do well with small spaces.<eos> You been here long?<eos> When I was a kid and I was acting up, my mother used to tease me and she used to threaten me saying she'd send me to Hecuba Prison.<eos> Now I'm here, and she won't even open my letters.<eos> Well, I barely know my mom.<eos> Though this one time she did sleep with my boyfriend, then try to kill me.<eos> Don't you have any kin waiting for you on the outside?<eos> I've got friends that are more than family.<eos> At least I did ... before this.
Collaborate.<eos> You haven't signed over the rights yet. Yet?<eos> You must make this work, Mrs. Travers.<eos> - Oh, I must, must I?<eos> - You need the money!<eos> - I don't want to see you go broke.<eos> - Stop saying money! It's a filthy, disgusting word!<eos> I'm picking up the phone now, Mrs. Travers.<eos> I have final say.<eos> You do.
Oh! Milk in first, please.<eos> Then the tea.<eos> And a spoonful of sugar.<eos> You don't intend for this film to be a musical?<eos> I absolutely do.<eos> No.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> Mr. Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.<eos> Yes, she does.
Do you want to know what it feels like to fly, Ginty?<eos> Come on. Albert, you old nag.<eos> Come here.<eos> Up you come.<eos> - Do you trust me?<eos> Nobody walks.<eos> A leisurely stroll is a gift.<eos> Beautiful, ain't it?<eos> If you like that sort of thing.<eos> I do.
Quite.<eos> Tommie?<eos> Scotch Mist?<eos> What do you think?<eos> What do I think, what?<eos> You're a woman.<eos> Oh, that's a canny observation, Walt.<eos> What am I missing here?<eos> You think the female of the species has some sort of psychic insight when it comes to others of her kind?<eos> We don't.
You're an impertinent man, you know?<eos> You ask an awful lot of questions that have absolutely no relevance to your being able to carry out your duties.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, I do, do that, yes.<eos> And you have no barometer.<eos> Let's just say I haven't family who would notice whether I were halfway across the world or sitting in my living room.<eos> Make a furrow.<eos> There. That's a good stick for digging.<eos> I got a kid.<eos> Most people do.
I think we all know how that feels, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Would you like to tell us more about your twin... or the different emotions that you've been going through?<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Did they say you could do that?<eos> No, they didn't.
This isn't gonna last if it's like that.<eos> If this is real, we gotta tell each other the bad stuff.<eos> And if this isn't real, if this is just my kind of imagination... then I wanna know now.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> I have never done this before.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't even know what the real me looks like.<eos> - Well, I think I do.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes, I do.
When you don't involve me, we're in free fall.<eos> I should have called you and I didn't.<eos> What happened?<eos> She says they need to keep me in Congress.<eos> Linda said that?<eos> Walker wasn't even there.<eos> That's what really gets me.<eos> He didn't have the courage to look me in the eye...<eos> I knew you shouldn't trust that woman.<eos> I didn't.

What are you doing with my car?<eos> Get away!<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I was just wondering why the music was so loud.<eos> That's all.<eos> - So the radio's on.<eos> I don't see what the big deal is.<eos> - Well, normally people turn their radios off when they park their cars.<eos> It's kind of strange to leave it on, don't you think?<eos> - No, I don't.
You and me both.<eos> I think it's a mistake to look at Batman's return in purely physical terms.<eos> I think it's a symbolic resurgence of the common man's will to resist.<eos> A rebirth of the American soul.<eos> Okay, easy on the rhetoric, Lana.<eos> The only thing Batman signifies is an aberrant psychotic force.<eos> The man's a danger to every citizen.<eos> - Hardly as dangerous as the criminals, is he?<eos> - Batman knows exactly what he's doing.<eos> His kind of fascist always does.
- Batman.<eos> Batman.<eos> Darling.<eos> They're using his name.<eos> He could at least release a clear statement against what they're doing.<eos> The Batman doesn't exactly come out with statements to the press.<eos> No, he can't, because he's an outlaw.<eos> How are the Sons of Batman his responsibility?<eos> - He didn't create them.<eos> - He absolutely did.
It's him.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> Just monitor his position.<eos> Wait, I lost him.<eos> Don't worry. He can't hide from what's coming.<eos> Isn't this a school night, young lady?<eos> Clark.<eos> This is between you and me.<eos> - We don't have to do this.<eos> - Sure we do.
Sounds about right.<eos> - See that ledge?<eos> Get another lamp up there.<eos> - Right, boss.<eos> - And, you, one there too.<eos> - Cool, boss.<eos> There's a fresh spring under here.<eos> I want our water supply set up in one hour.<eos> - We ain't got forever, people.<eos> - Sure we do.
Have a seat.<eos> I'm Bernice Deagan, director of the Golden Quill National Spelling Bee.<eos> Struthious.<eos> What did she say?<eos> S-T-R-U-T-H-I-O-U-S.<eos> Struthious.<eos> That was my winning word. Oh.<eos> 1973, national champion.<eos> Just thought you should know that in case you didn't already.<eos> No, I didn't.

No girlfriend for you?<eos> You can't find one little chicken tikka to get your shrimp tandoori all up in?<eos> Nope.<eos> But when I do get one, it's going to be a girl with nipples.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Well, lucky for you, they all have nipples, pal.<eos> Every girl does not have nipples.<eos> No.<eos> They do.<eos> No, they don't.
You saying you want to come over and fuck off again?<eos> No, that's not what I'm...<eos> You want to look for your underwear?<eos> Just give me 10 minutes.<eos> Guy, I wanted to give you something before the round starts.<eos> A little Wite-Out and a Lego piece, and you got your car back.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> But I'm still gonna totally bust your nut.<eos> I don't think you mean to say that.<eos> I do.
And all contestants deserve a fair chance.<eos> And it didn't even stop him.<eos> God damn it!<eos> You're done.<eos> Did I enunciate that clearly enough?<eos> Mr. Trilby, you have a message.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got a duck pond, huh?<eos> Did you want to see me, Dr. Bowman?<eos> Yes, I do, Mr. Trilby.
- Give or take a couple of 'em.<eos> Of a million?<eos> Watch out.<eos> There's a camera right there.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so after they're done upstairs we drop it in here, it piles up until it's full.<eos> Half the time the drivers don't even bring it upstairs first.<eos> So how do they know how much is in there? They don't.<eos> - They don't?
Give me a reason.<eos> Give me one reason.<eos> OK.<eos> Where do we find the money to pay for these fakes?<eos> It cost Guy ten grand to fake one.<eos> These fakes would have to stand up to carbon dating and expert scrutiny shit.<eos> Ten grand a book, that's a hundred grand.<eos> I can front it.<eos> You got a 100 grand laying around, Nicky?<eos> Yes, I do.
Domenic Calhoun, we've received information giving us probable cause for a search.<eos> Look who we have here.<eos> Georges Seurat.<eos> "Model, Rear-View," 1887.<eos> Pointillist phase.<eos> This is so beautiful.<eos> I love all the little dots.<eos> It's very artistic.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I do.
Staying off the kingsroad, are you?<eos> They get you no matter where you go.<eos> - You can't win.<eos> - No, you really can't.<eos> Looks like you're safe enough, though.<eos> Meaning no offense, my lady, but... I wouldn't tangle with you.<eos> - Seven blessings to you.<eos> - And you.<eos> Jaime: He knows who I am.<eos> - He doesn't.
When I'm free, will I be free to go? - Crow!<eos> - Crow!<eos> Sure, you will.<eos> And I'll be free to kill you.<eos> Got no respect, this lot.<eos> Got no fathers to slap them when they're foul.<eos> What happened to their fathers?<eos> Some of them were killed by crows like you.<eos> Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.<eos> And if he don't...
That was no fight.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Olyver, if it please you.<eos> I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Know what?<eos> That I wanted to.<eos> My lord...<eos> I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.<eos> They rarely do, in my experience.
I made a choice... and I chose wrong.<eos> And now I've burned everything down.<eos> Not everything, my lord.<eos> She's up here.<eos> - Yara. - Shh.<eos> Wait.<eos> I brought him back.<eos> He killed the others.<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't.
I owe you a significant debt.<eos> Our redheaded friend.<eos> You secured her release when the Queen detained her.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Of course.<eos> A simple misunderstanding.<eos> Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.<eos> We don't. I did fuck her once.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But we don't.
About a week, I think.<eos> You think?<eos> You don't know?<eos> When we went to Castle Black, we took The Kingsroad.<eos> You and your roads.<eos> Is that how you lot do your fighting?<eos> You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?<eos> Most of the time, yes.<eos> How do the men holding the banners fight?<eos> They don't, really.
Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where.<eos> Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed.<eos> The seventh will be the same.<eos> Mance is different.<eos> You don't have the discipline.<eos> You don't have the training.<eos> Your army is no army.<eos> You don't know how to fight together.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Tools. Now.<eos> And if they're ruined, you're going to work the whole set off this summer.<eos> I mean it.<eos> A paper route.<eos> Big Chief Indian Corn.<eos> Goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You have your pick.<eos> This bullshit ends today.<eos> Yes, it does.
- That's powerful stuff.<eos> - That's not...<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?<eos> We're under a lot of stress, Captain.<eos> I'm sorry about...<eos> You know Patrick was our only boy.<eos> - "Is."<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Oh, God.<eos> So smug.<eos> Dude, food attracts mice.<eos> And you know what mice attract?<eos> - Stupid fucking questions?<eos> - No.<eos> They attract snakes.<eos> In Italian, the word for "snake"<eos> means "the demon's cock."<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I was wrong.<eos> I would never do that again.<eos> Joe.<eos> I...<eos> I, um, got this for you from the gift shop.<eos> Uh, it has an eagle on it, the snake's natural enemy.<eos> "You're miles above the rest."<eos> I... I guess they didn't have one that said, uh,<eos> "You saved me from an agonizing death by rapid blood oxygenation."<eos> Uh, they did; just no envelopes.
So sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Look at you, you look great.<eos> You haven't changed a bit.<eos> You've put on a little weight.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Good to see you're still honest.<eos> I think you are going to be a great nominee.<eos> And you know what, I would have put you up last time, but I didn't think I could drag you out of that town.<eos> Well, things change, Pete.<eos> So they do.
- Some tea, I thought.<eos> - I thought maybe...<eos> Yes, tea, I think.<eos> In my experience, I have to say, artists are an irresponsible bunch, who often fail to provide a proper home for themselves, let alone a wife and family.<eos> Yes, that does sound like us.<eos> My daughter has not been short of suitors, Mr Munnings.<eos> - I should think not.<eos> - And as for you, as a token of your intent and before we can discuss any serious arrangements, I would expect you to earn 1,000 guineas a year.<eos> Done.<eos> I do already.
Press on his wound. What?<eos> Get the letter opener and press on his wound!<eos> Get the letter opener on the desk!<eos> Grab the letter opener!<eos> No, Mom!<eos> Listen to me. lam just trying to protect my family.<eos> Just calm down.<eos> Mom!<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Do it, Mary! Do it!
Perhaps the most important.<eos> The parents must withdraw their formal complaint.<eos> Perhaps we can pay for the funeral.<eos> As a first step.<eos> The mother should be contacted first.<eos> Not just now.<eos> Give them a bit of space, you know.<eos> Right.<eos> Talk to Erdogan, make sure the blood test is ready by 11.<eos> I did.
The red gate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still, it's a better-looking house.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's the last thing I ask of you.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> Don't leave me alone.<eos> Come in with me.<eos> I don't know what to tell these people.<eos> And I do?
Oh, it's so good to have you back.<eos> O'Hara, we need your help on this gurney.<eos> Wrong shoes for this. Ooh, never thought I would miss Cruz.<eos> - I heard that.<eos> - As a doctor.<eos> He was a lousy administrator.<eos> - You are so much better.<eos> - No shit.<eos> You gotta pull the trigger on the new trauma guy.<eos> Already did.
- What the fuck was what?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I will rip your hand off at the spine. You work on your boob-grabbing Tourette situation on your own time.<eos> From now on, we're gonna finish conversations.<eos> And what is this conversation about?<eos> Dr. Roman has had every bump in the road smoothed over because she's...<eos> - Hot?<eos> - Expecting it.<eos> Next time she's not cutting it, say something.<eos> - I did.
You took him on Space Mountain?<eos> !<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Did you black out again?<eos> He could barely handle the tea cups!<eos> You didn't think Space Mountain would freak him out?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks so much.<eos> Did she eat?<eos> No, she did not.
He's back at it again.<eos> Why isn't he at work?<eos> He's just...<eos> This woman has a grip on him.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> It's gonna ruin his marriage.<eos> Thank you for breakfast, Mommy.<eos> Will you be coming by to watch Days of Our Lives later?<eos> Well, we got to find out which twin murdered Renaldo, right?<eos> We sure do.
I'll see you around.<eos> Becky, you be having great summer.<eos> I was one inch away from knocking that guy out, and I swear to God.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> This is grown-up talk, so butt out!<eos> That's insane!<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> I said, "Hey, Cavanaugh, you speak to me like that again<eos> "in front of my wife and kid, I will brush your teeth with a brick."<eos> No, you didn't.
Have you thought about taking instructions?<eos> That's not something I do very well.<eos> I mean, in order to become a Catholic. Then you could confess and you will be forgiven for your sins.<eos> What if they're unforgivable?<eos> Nothing is unforgivable.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I haven't killed anybody, but I've been pretty bad.<eos> Look, we have people here waiting to go to confession so, I'm sorry.<eos> They can wait.<eos> I did.
So, I called up the Sheriff there and I asked him, had they found any dead bodies along the side of the highway?<eos> And he said that they did.<eos> And I said, "Thank you," and I hung up.<eos> I know you think I'm kidding. But I'm not.<eos> And I'm not out.<eos> That's right.<eos> And I'm not kidding about that either.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I know where the truck is going.<eos> I always did.
Hey, Phil.<eos> What's up?<eos> What's up?<eos> It's crunch time, dude.<eos> Krayton's coming in for the redesign pitch today.<eos> Need that bad boy ASA quick as possible.<eos> Yeah, no, I got all the versions you wanted done, exactly per your specs.<eos> What's that one right there?<eos> Oh, I actually...<eos> I actually just did a design of my own, too.
Yeah.<eos> You're nice. You are.<eos> That's what I like about you.<eos> That's what everyone likes about you.<eos> I wouldn't want you to change that.<eos> But there's a time to be nice.<eos> And then there's also a time when you have to say, "Enough is enough."<eos> And stick your foot so far up a prick like Phil's ass that he chokes on your fucking shoelaces.<eos> And I think now is one of those times.<eos> I do, too.
You're out of your fucking mind.<eos> - I swore an oath.<eos> - Oaths are horseshit, Steinar.<eos> I gave him my word.<eos> I will not break it.<eos> Hakan is almost certain to be dead by now.<eos> And if he's not, he was fucking insane before he was banished;<eos> he'll only be more so now.<eos> Anyway, who knows where the fuck he is?<eos> - You do.
Desmond.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm very well, thanks.<eos> Though a little hot.<eos> Your father, I think, is not so well.<eos> Cancer.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm very unhappy about it, Tim.<eos> At your wedding he said he loved me.<eos> He does.
You have to read Jesse's books.<eos> If you wanna know what it's like to have sex with me, read away.<eos> - Read away.<eos> - Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.<eos> I mean it's well written.<eos> - Yeah. Thank you.<eos> - We met about 18 years ago. We kind of, sort of fell in love a little bit, and then we... A bit.<eos> Then we lost track of each other. A decade later, we ran into each other.<eos> - We didn't run into each other.<eos> - We didn't? No.
My first and last piece of good news.<eos> -Mrs. Banks, one last thing.<eos> -What is he doing?<eos> -We need more amps to light the house and tent. It's cheaper than a new line.<eos> In terms of the florals out front, we're gonna color-coordinate with the swans, right?<eos> -Swans? -NINA:<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We're having swans? Franck thought it would be great to have swans around the tulip border -as the guests enter...<eos> -We don't have a border.<eos> -You will.
Then the temperature dropped so fast, the whole lake just froze.<eos> Then the ducks took off and took the lake with 'em. Now that lake's somewhere in Georgia, the way I hear it.<eos> Go on now.<eos> God bless you, ma'am.<eos> Here, try this.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> - They're okay. - The truth.<eos> They're terrible.<eos> Tell me how you feel.<eos> I will.
Did you know Jane speaks five different languages?<eos> "Clipper Ships" by Matt Montini.<eos> "Me and my dad make models of clipper ships."<eos> "I like clipper ships because they are fast."<eos> "Clipper ships sail the ocean."<eos> "Clipper ships never sail on rivers or lakes."<eos> "Clipper ships have lots of sails and are made out of wood."<eos> OK. Who's next?<eos> I want to write a book about Fred about his formative experiences.<eos> His life story, if you will.
When they moved into this house, they got rid of all the furniture - all of it.<eos> Now they see me and...<eos> I seem so Americanised.<eos> And you have an American wife.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> The last thing I wanted was to insult them...<eos> I know.<eos> Honey, it's going to seem strange for a while, but, believe me, they want to love you.<eos> They will.
- It's not about me!<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> I don't like being lied to.<eos> I don't like secrets.<eos> I could report you. Have your license suspended.<eos> Stop acting like a petulant child.<eos> You haven't answered me.<eos> Who wrote this book?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
But there was this one guy. He was kinda cool.<eos> He taught me engines.<eos> Hold here.<eos> Mom screwed it up, of course.<eos> She'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader.<eos> And that'll be all she wrote.<eos> Torque wrench. please.<eos> - Here.<eos> I wish I could've met my real dad.<eos> You will.
When are you picking me up?<eos> All right!<eos> Around 2:30.<eos> OK.<eos> What kind of stuff do I bring?<eos> Warm etuff, I guees.<eos> It'e the mountains.<eos> I'm bringing everything.<eos> OK.<eos> I will, too, then.
Everyone else has.<eos> Ever since Paris.<eos> Ever since Cybill killed herself.<eos> Cybill's death was a sailing accident.<eos> - That's what I am - a survivor.<eos> - Tiffany!<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> Sorry for the both of us.<eos> Sorry for the child that... we never had.<eos> - And never will!
- Sergeant?<eos> There's something you might wanna see.<eos> - What?<eos> - Take a look.<eos> - I thought you said you had no kids.<eos> - Alice left us a long time ago.<eos> The Lord saw fit to come and take her.<eos> Never touched the room since.<eos> We're foolish, I suppose, but... in a sense, she still lives here.<eos> - And always will.
Well I can get it for you.<eos> Does that mean you'll take the case?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll take a drive out, to see what Charles is up to.<eos> Doesn't look like it's on the level, well, we'll discuss my taking your case.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - I appreciate it, Mr. March.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> And don't forget, your husbands social security number.<eos> I won't.
You want to come to my club and bus tables on fish night?<eos> - It doesn't pay much but no one will look if you take butter back to the wife and kids.<eos> Daddy, please, please!<eos> Get away from me, you prideless vermin.<eos> I was not born to be a busboy.<eos> I'm a shoe man, born and bred, damn it.<eos> There's not a shoe store that wouldn't pay $1.25 an hour to have the best.<eos> You hear my words.<eos> I will not let my family starve.<eos> I will not.
Don't get too close.<eos> You'll set off the alarm.<eos> And I don't think the local army commandant... will appreciate being dragged here from his bed at this time of night.<eos> - The army?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Far more reliable than the island's police.<eos> One of the benefits of having friends in high places.<eos> That's some pearl, Mr. Duval.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Yes, and you never will.
You see that dark spot there?<eos> Whiplash.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> And this smudge that looks like my fingerprint?<eos> No.<eos> That's trauma!<eos> -Am I going to die?<eos> -Yes, son!<eos> Homer!<eos> No, of course you won't.
This isn't working at all.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> "Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity.<eos> "No matter what you tell your child to do... he will always do the opposite." Huh?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You gotta use reverse psychology.<eos> That sounds too complicated.<eos> - Okay, don't use reverse psychology.<eos> - All right, I will.
calm and peaceful, the sea was in the dawn's glow.<eos> I did not know that cold death Waited for me at the bottom that sad day<eos> Still haunts me Wherever I go<eos> Fora monthafterJohn'searhealed, EverytimeJohnsneezedastrangesqueakysoundemerged fromhis ear.<eos> Thisdelightedourbearers theykeptaskinghim tohold hisnoseandmakethatwhistlesound<eos> John was not amused.<eos> Sidi, tell them to stay away. Don't let them drink.<eos> This water is infected.<eos> If I get smallpox, you must leave me behind.<eos> - Yes, Yes, I will.
This town's finished for me... at least for a while.<eos> There are certain shades of limelight that can wreck a girl's complexion.<eos> They'll have the rope up at every saloon in town.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> When you get back to town, call the New York Times or whoever you call.<eos> Mail me a list of the 50 richest men in Brazil.<eos> The 50 richest!<eos> Holly.<eos> I won't let you do this.<eos> - You won't?
It's all right.<eos> I don't want to have any secrets from you.<eos> I don't want there to be any lies between us.<eos> Secrets kill people's happiness.<eos> I don't want us to be like that.<eos> We won't. We won't be.<eos> We have to do what's right.<eos> What you said yesterday was true.<eos> If we don't find out what happened to Laura, it won't go away, our whole lives.<eos> We will, James.
I don't have the money yet. They don't either.<eos> I know, I just feel... there's always somebody watching over me.<eos> Every time I do something, I feel like somebody's... thinking that they could do it better.<eos> What? I don't know.<eos> I put something down, I like how it looks on the coffee table...<eos> I come back and it's moved.<eos> You want me to talk to her?<eos> I'd like to put something down, and have it there when I return.<eos> Do you want me to talk to her?<eos> I will.
You do want the job, do you not?<eos> This way, Doc...<eos> You spend much time in a chronic hospital?<eos> - You would remember.<eos> - I guess not, then.<eos> We have M.S., Tourette syndrome, Parkinson's disease some of them we have not got a name for.<eos> - What are they waiting for?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - How will they get well?<eos> - They will not.
- Babies can be very ratty in their sleep.<eos> - Oh, no, not him. - I'm sure he always sleeps sweetly.<eos> - Yes, but I'm not a baby.<eos> I never said you were.<eos> I only said that you slept like a baby.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> Robert is very keen for you to stay and have dinner with us.<eos> He told me not to let you have your clothes till you agreed.<eos> You must be starving, anyway.<eos> So you will?
Felipe.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> - All the time.<eos> - I told you he was American.<eos> - L. Isten. We can't dec. Ide.<eos> - What you want. Is a da. Iqu.<eos> Daiquiris. Dos.<eos> - And what if I don't like it?<eos> - You will.
I'll be here, flexing.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hey, Sam, that girl's going out with you just 'cause you let her hit you?<eos> No, she's going out with me because I'm a lean, tight specimen hunk.<eos> ( guffawing ): No, really, Sam.<eos> Woody, I'm trying to teach you something here.<eos> Listen, they go for it every time.<eos> You ought to try it someday.<eos> All right, for the sake of argument, I will.
I'VE MEMORIZED THE NUMBERS.<eos> BUT NOW, MY GOVERNMENT MUST KNOW THAT I'M HERE, OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ATTACKED YOU AND SEARCHED HERE.<eos> YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT.<eos> WELL, THEY MUST SUSPECT I HAVE THE FAX NUMBERS,<eos> BUT THE TAPE, NO.<eos> IF THEY SUSPECTED THAT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED THE MOMENT I LANDED HERE.<eos> THEY WOULD NOT HAVE RISKED ME EXPOSING THE TRUTH WITH THIS TAPE.<eos> PEOPLE MUST SEE THIS TAPE.<eos> THEY WILL, MEI JAN.<eos> THEY WILL.
Twelve thousand seven hundred telephones.<eos> All the eggs in one basket.<eos> Got another idea.<eos> Wanna hear it?<eos> Yeah, shoot.<eos> The detonator in the grenade.<eos> You think that'll blow those doors?<eos> Nope.<eos> But you're on something, Pete.<eos> C-4 inside it will.
But this is the Officers' Club.<eos> Mechanoids aren't allowed in here!<eos> C'mon, sit down.<eos> Let me pour you a drink.<eos> - No, no, no, I should be doing that.<eos> - Not tonight, buddy!<eos> Is that alcohol?<eos> I don't drink alcohol.<eos> It has no effect on my diodes.<eos> This will, mate.
Sure.<eos> I've got homework.<eos> Let's spend an afternoon together.<eos> Go wherever you say.<eos> How about it?<eos> Sure.<eos> What do you want for your birthday? .<eos> Dunno yet.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I will.
The kunoichi, the female ninja, they're masters at it.<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> Machine-gun work?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - I'm OK.<eos> - Good.<eos> Look, if we don't get that vaccine in time, you've got to kill me.<eos> - What?<eos> - If it doesn't work...<eos> - It will.
- How long would you be gone for?<eos> - If I make the team, maybe a couple of months.<eos> - Like two?<eos> - Or more like three.<eos> - What do you get if you win?<eos> - A medal.<eos> - Can I have it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then you'd better win.<eos> - Okay, I will.
I'll play those tapes for him soon as he gets back.<eos> Are you sure we recorded enough, Mr Clement?<eos> I can play anything you want.<eos> You're good, boy, but a piano ain't never gonna make you no money.<eos> Little girls like guitar players nowadays.<eos> They like to watch 'em wiggle around.<eos> You can't do that behind a piano.<eos> So, what did Mr Sam Phillips think of the great Jerry Lee Lewis?<eos> - He ain't heard him yet.<eos> - But he will.
You didn't mention helicopters, automatic weapons, Krugerrands...<eos> This was bigger than we thought.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> I worked psycho ward. You'll never get out.<eos> One minute, fifteen seconds.<eos> Shapiro, scratch my nose.<eos> Hey! What's going on? Is this kindergarten or a police station?<eos> Get some work done.<eos> Houdini Jr. Bets he can free himself in 5 minutes.<eos> I will too.
They're in last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake?<eos> I've heard baseball players make very good salaries these days.<eos> Well, that depends on how good they are, I guess.<eos> How good are you?<eos> I make the league minimum.<eos> He was one of the best in baseball before he had problems with his knees.<eos> Well, Jake, what are you gonna do when your career's over?<eos> I mean, you can't play baseball forever, can you?<eos> Something will come up.<eos> Will it?
you don't believe me?<eos> this is my last cigarette.<eos> was it that good?<eos> you were the best thing in a thousand years, bill.<eos> I was, wasn't I?<eos> I was stunned.<eos> why?<eos> it's been so long since I've... enjoyed myself... let alone been swept away.<eos> do you believe in fate?<eos> I will if you will.
Smell it, go on...<eos> - It smells.<eos> - A dog's piss doesn't come out.<eos> But that isn't the worst of it.<eos> It's the velvets I'm worried about.<eos> They're so badly handled at the laundry.<eos> They come back discoloured.<eos> I'll pay for the damages, Dona Violeta.<eos> I'll pay whatever it is.<eos> Damn right you will.
Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good luck with thejob.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Nice day, isn't it?<eos> So far, so good.<eos> I'll pick you up in front of the building.<eos> Remember, wait for the beeps.<eos> Wait for the beeps. Wait for the beep.<eos> I will.
Yeah, he's all right.<eos> He's a little under the weather.<eos> - Oh, mother.<eos> - Come here, kid.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Got you.<eos> Sorry, mister.<eos> It's all right, sweetie, you just banged my funny bone.<eos> You ought to try being a little more careful with that thing.<eos> I will.
- Ann is just very...<eos> - Hung up.<eos> - It just wasn't a smart thing to do.<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have a contract with you saying that he wouldn't broadcast these things?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You realise you have no recourse legally?<eos> It's not funny. It's not funny, Cynthia.<eos> These tapes could show up anywhere.<eos> They won't.
NO, MAN!<eos> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!<eos> YOU GOTTA FIX IT!<eos> OR WHAT?<eos> YOU GOTTA HELP ME.<eos> IT'S ALEX THAT DID THIS.<eos> GOD DAMN. I CAN'T STOP WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ME.<eos> I'LL PAY, MAN.<eos> I WILL PAY.<eos> YES, OF COURSE, YOU WILL.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Sean.<eos> Buddy, let's take a ride.<eos> Come on, hurry up.<eos> It's your lucky day, man.<eos> I'm gonna forget about the bread you owe me.<eos> I'm gonna give you a free taste.<eos> I'm looking for a missing person.<eos> I won't give you Danny.<eos> Yeah, you will.
i have been so busy getting engaged and things, i forgot to mention it to you.<eos> thank god for that.<eos> you could kneel down and do it properly.<eos> there he is.<eos> how handsome he looks.<eos> - and romantic.<eos> - and brave.<eos> and nervous.<eos> i hope your plan will work.<eos> of course it will.
God, I can't keep giving you these free lessons. So quit screwing around and help me up.<eos> You look great, man.<eos> Be careful with the bags.<eos> We got a boy going to the Show.<eos> Sorry about last night.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I have been known on occasion to howl at the moon.<eos> You understand?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you will.
That type says, "I know, you don't.<eos> I see, you don't." You're exaggerating, Camille.<eos> He never mentioned our work!<eos> Do you realize?<eos> What a lout!<eos> Does that amuse you?<eos> Not me.<eos> You can yawn for daddy on Sunday.<eos> Until now daddy went along with you.<eos> But this time he won't.
That's why my films make money.<eos> They're an escape, a vicarious release of fear.<eos> Same thing with this game.<eos> Nobody takes my films or the Dead Pool seriously.<eos> Well, someone gave Squares the drugs that killed him.<eos> Maybe it was you.<eos> You can't tie me into Johnny's death just because of a coincidence.<eos> My assistant and my effects supervisor played too.<eos> Why not talk to them?<eos> We Will.
No, no, no, no.<eos> You're all I got!<eos> Don't you do nothing foolish.<eos> I'm just gonna ask a few questions, that's all.<eos> - No, Jack.<eos> - Ma, just a few questions. I promise.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
- News.<eos> What news?<eos> A guy called Crazy Fai sells dynamite.<eos> Nine o'clock, Hoi Wong Bar.<eos> - Do you know what we'll do next?<eos> Really?<eos> - What do you want? - Are you Fai?<eos> I want to talk.<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> - No. But you will.
Well, I just wanted a change of scenery.<eos> Grits started leaving a bad taste in my mouth.<eos> If that's how you feel, Mr. FBI Man, why don't you get the hell out?<eos> Go back to your Commie, nigger-loving boss.<eos> You must not know my boss, Mr. Hoover.<eos> He's not too fond of Commies.<eos> He'd be on your side.<eos> I don't give two shits whose side he's on.<eos> We got 5,000 niggers in this county who ain't registered to vote yet.<eos> And they never will.
- Daisy?<eos> - Hi, Mom.<eos> You going to 11 o'clock mass?<eos> No.<eos> I went last night.<eos> I got to get lunch ready.<eos> Uncle Vic and Aunt Rosalie are coming' over.<eos> Daisy?<eos> You help me with lunch.<eos> - Kat will.
Steven, I love my husband.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If we're gonna be married, you'll have to get over that.<eos> I know you don't believe it, but he loves me, too. He does.<eos> Sometimes I think he deserves a medal.<eos> You just took it too far.<eos> We were...<eos> We are friends, we are.<eos> It's not like we won't see each other.<eos> We will.
It should be educational, working with a real gunfighter.<eos> Maybe he'll give you some pointers.<eos> Yeah, I bet he will.<eos> You've got the wrong end of the horse.<eos> Depends on how you look at it.<eos> If you was Tony Jr. Here, you'd think you got the wrong end of Tom Mix.<eos> - Bye, Alfie.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Did he say yes?<eos> - No, but he will.
Tess McGill's office.<eos> Katharine...<eos> No.<eos> Of course it's still your office.<eos> I was just...<eos> I'll see you, Tess.<eos> Cyn.<eos> Sometimes I sing and dance around the house in my underwear.<eos> Doesn't make me Madonna.<eos> Never will.
David!<eos> You came in second.<eos> You did great.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know, I used to get mad at my father for not believing in me.<eos> But he's right.<eos> I am a loser.<eos> - Who's gonna buy me a drink?<eos> - Not me!<eos> I will, Geoffrey.
I could only dream of having somebody like Chris for a girlfriend.<eos> But you've got her.<eos> - And you treat her like this?<eos> - Don't waste your time, half-pint.<eos> Her legs are locked together at the knee.<eos> I'd love to hit you. - I'd love to pound on your face.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> But I won't.<eos> You're so slimy, I won't sink to your level.<eos> I will.
What do you wanna do now?<eos> There's a party down the street.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You destroyed my life and now you want to go to a party?<eos> - You don't like me, do you?<eos> - I've never hit a woman before, but...<eos> - Let's make up.<eos> - That won't work.<eos> - Of course, it will.

The Japs haven't got enough camps for all of us.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> She's with God now.<eos> What are you doing, Basie?<eos> Looks like your size, Jim.<eos> I don't want her shoes.<eos> Basie, don't.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> -I don't want them.<eos> -Somebody will.
You stink!<eos> I'd like smell you when you're 97.<eos> He's not 97.<eos> In dog years.<eos> It's just not gonna break.<eos> Why don't we get the Lee sisters to look at it? Yeah.<eos> No, we could throw it off the roof tomorrow.<eos> Let's go party.<eos> - She won't let us.<eos> - Sure she will.
Oh, no.<eos> She knows about the suitcase.<eos> Margaret the Cowboy is in town and we don't have that other chip.<eos> I'm awfully busy right now, Victor.<eos> I'll have to call you back.<eos> Just get me that chip!<eos> I tipped the desk clerk $1 00 for this room so we could hear his every move.<eos> When he leaves, we go too.<eos> What if he stays in?<eos> He won't.
Get killed?<eos> - I won't wait for you.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Then I'll have Kamran send you direct to London.<eos> You dumb, stubborn, stupid...<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Back end of horse!<eos> Are you calling me a horse's arse?<eos> I might never see you again.<eos> You will.
Hi, honey.<eos> Oh, yeah, it was a great idea he and I spending time like this together.<eos> I hope so.<eos> I know it won't be easy.<eos> Oh, no, everything's gonna be great.<eos> I know it is. So, how you feeling?<eos> Linc, whatever happens, I want you to stay with him.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you, but it's really important.<eos> He needs you, honey.<eos> I will.
Let go.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Oh, we almost hit a deer.<eos> That's all.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, I'm fine.<eos> Yes, I'm fine.<eos> It's hot in here.<eos> Take your parka off.<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
But then that is our strength.<eos> We always act as one.<eos> You make no sense, bursa.<eos> You say you treat your servants like your own family, yet if one of them claims any of your land, no matter how useless, you kill him.<eos> The land, no matter how useless, has belonged to my family for one thousand years.<eos> I hold it for my son, as my father held it for me, and his father before him.<eos> We will never let it go.<eos> We can't let go.<eos> What happens if the communists win the election?<eos> They won't.
- I know it.<eos> Your father, God rest his soul... he was a screw-up and he turned out just fine.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Don't you remember?<eos> - Well, yeah, I guess.<eos> - Now, give me a kiss.<eos> Mary, give me a kiss.<eos> And now, you and your friends clean this place up.<eos> If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.<eos> - We-We will. We will.
I love you, Luke.<eos> Trouble, big trouble.<eos> - Are you talking to me?<eos> - Get your feet down, and clean up the mess.<eos> The only reason you're still in one piece is because you're related to a friend of mine. But I'm warning you:<eos> Don't play smart ass with me. You got the picture?<eos> The only reason I'm in this horseshit- factory is because Moose wants in that way.<eos> - It's obvious you take me for some idiot.<eos> - I don't know you that well, not yet.<eos> You will, kid.

I'm gonna save my empire.<eos> God!<eos> It was like Judgment Day.<eos> Like it says in the Bible:<eos> All sinners shall burn in everlasting fire.<eos> I'm a sinner too.<eos> I'm gonna burn in hell with you, Elkanah.<eos> Stop it, Ashton.<eos> Nothing happened to you!<eos> But it will.
Oh, yeah.<eos> It's loads of fun once you get used to it.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I don't plan on becoming used to it.<eos> I didn't plan on being here at all.<eos> I was supposed to receive a sample.<eos> All right, let's talk delivery.<eos> Now, Lydia, my friends here....<eos> I hope your plans for the delivery turn out better... than the delivery of the sample.<eos> They will.
To the Lost Soul Crusade,<eos> "hell" and "damnation" are not words to be taken lightly.<eos> Yes, ma'am, but what about extending?<eos> We're booked into Los Angeles this week. And then we have special ceremonies for the groundbreaking at the tabernacle site on Tuesday.<eos> Are you folks really spending $5 million to build it?<eos> It'll be the finest temple to the glory of the Almighty in America.<eos> The first $1 million is already in escrow.<eos> Mrs. Brown, your end of tonight's take is $30,000, we took in about $50,000. Fine.<eos> Will you be waiting around for it?<eos> Luke will.
Papa, when we land, I'll look.<eos> This is... Oh, whoa, whoa! Oh, oh, this is nice.<eos> Oh, thanks, fellas.<eos> I appreciate you coming back for me.<eos> You in the front, higher, higher!<eos> Oh, Henri, she's so beautiful.<eos> Henri, what's that over there? Oh, that is more America.<eos> Can we go see it?<eos> You will, my little American.<eos> Someday, you will.
Yeah?<eos> What have you just decided?<eos> No one's ever going to speak for you again?<eos> Come on.<eos> How are you going to manage?<eos> Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.<eos> "She wants, she thinks."<eos> And most of the time they were wrong.<eos> They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.<eos> And now they won't.
We're here for the Crites.<eos> The county is going to pay for this, Jeff.<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff Barnes?<eos> Jay.<eos> Jay, what are you doing?<eos> Maybe we ought to just stay put.<eos> They haven't gotten into the house yet.<eos> They will.
OK, let's move!<eos> Damn.<eos> It's gonna be light soon.<eos> - Take off.<eos> I'll delay the reinforcements.<eos> - OK. Then you join Pete.<eos> - I'll see you at the airport.<eos> - I won't be able to wait for you.<eos> - Then don't wait.<eos> - I won't.
Thanks for everything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> - Zack.<eos> - And, uh, take care.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, Bob.<eos> - I will.
You gotta be kidding.<eos> All the globe-hopping we've done, and you want to sail around the world.<eos> Just once.<eos> Just once, i want to do it in style.<eos> No deserts, no jun-- no mosquitoes.<eos> No guns.<eos> Just Sandy beaches, sipping champagne in fine restaurants, gambling in casinos, and women.<eos> Man, I can't wait.<eos> I don't remember inviting you.<eos> You will.
I really have to go.<eos> But, baby, it's cold outside.<eos> This evening has been.<eos> - So happy that you dropped...<eos> - So nice.<eos> Look out the window at the storm.<eos> Bill.<eos> My boy Bill<eos> I will see that he's named after me<eos> I will.
I'd never have been able to stay true without you here.<eos> So without each other, we'd both be alive this time tomorrow.<eos> Oh, but we will.<eos> We will have taken flight to the world that's invisible, where we're sure of bliss.<eos> - Where we will dwell in paradise.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please for an hour.<eos> Whatever may happen to their souls, in the flesh, they have just a night left.<eos> What harm to leave them for a while?<eos> So, then, we will.
I want you to go with Number Five and make sure they do not... switch off the memory. Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> - Absolutely, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye-bye, goofy woman.<eos> I enjoyed repeatedly throwing you to the ground.<eos> No mistake.<eos> You can call me if you want to.<eos> Call you?<eos> To let me know if Number Five's okay.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
You should have said something.<eos> You didn't give me a chance, Otis.<eos> You threw the fucker right out the window.<eos> It ain't my fault it broke. Oh right.<eos> Go back and get it if you want. Yeah.<eos> Want to get a beer?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> I want a beer.<eos> If you want a beer so bad, Otis, go ahead and get one.<eos> All right, I will.
George, listen.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> We could make things right for Fisk.<eos> How's that?<eos> We both get allowances.<eos> We could give him the money to hire somebody to run his farm.<eos> Then he could stay at the Point.<eos> Fisk is too proud.<eos> He wouldn't accept charity like that.<eos> Yes, he will.
WHY DO PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE TO STICK THEIR NOSES INTO MY BUSINESS?<eos> RENE, HE DEFENDED YOUR REPUTATION.<eos> THEY WERE SAYING THAT PERHAPS YOU HAD A YELLOW STEAK.<eos> IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY.<eos> FOR ONE THING, I HAVE BEEN SITTING ALL NIGHT ON HALF A DOZEN EGGS.<eos> HERE, GENTLEMEN, A DRINK ON THE HOUSE.<eos> I AM MOST GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR UPHOLDING THE HONOR OF MY FUTURE HUSBAND, WHO SCARPERED OUT OF THE SCULLERY WINDOW<eos> BECAUSE HE HAS THE COURAGE OF A HAMSTER. I'M SURE RENE WOULD NOT RUN AWAY<eos> LIKE A COWARD. THERE WILL BE AN EXPLANATION.<eos> OF COURSE THERE WILL.
With your clothes off!<eos> You going to learn.<eos> Eventualy.<eos> That it's much less painful to do things in my way.<eos> You, and your rebel friends...<eos> I have not rebels friends!<eos> Oh, thets it's time you stardet being more agreeable.<eos> Clothes off!<eos> I will never understand why some people is so animate about choosing the wrong side.<eos> No, you never will.
The Thunder Road, I christen thee the Thunder Road,<eos> The Thunder Road!<eos> - Oh, now it breaks.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> I knew we should've put hinges on this thing.<eos> I'll take it very easy at first because something might happen and we all could be killed.<eos> Stop talking about getting killed.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> What if the ship falls apart?<eos> - She won't.
Go out there and help her.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> And try not to screw it up.<eos> - I'm not doing so good, am I?<eos> - You're doing fine.<eos> - I don't think Max likes me too much.<eos> - Max doesn't like anybody.<eos> I don't know why you waste your time.<eos> She doesn't know you exist.<eos> Yeah, but someday she will.
Oh, I don't know.<eos> Why not?<eos> What's stopping you?<eos> Well, Andy, for one.<eos> - Who's Andy?<eos> - My boyfriend.<eos> He's real jealous.<eos> He flunked French in high school... and thinks that everything over there is set up to make guys like him look dumb.<eos> Well, I bet if he knew how important it is to you, he'd change his mind.<eos> No, he won't.
Never before had to have a mortgage, now we may have to have two.<eos> Winter's comin' on.<eos> New house isn't finished.<eos> He broke his leg, Aunt Em.<eos> Dorothy, that leg's mended.<eos> Hurry up and get yourself ready.<eos> We're going to be late.<eos> Bye, Uncle Henry!<eos> Y'all get yourselves back here by dark!<eos> We will!
-Where's Father Andrew?<eos> -He's busy.<eos> -We're all busy.<eos> -He's giving last rites.<eos> Through this holy anointing, may the Lord pardon all your sins.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> Donovan.<eos> They mustn't win.<eos> They can't.<eos> They won't.
Gilly, where are your manners?<eos> Why don't you offer Benzie a drink?<eos> Want a raspberry squash?<eos> Sure he does.<eos> Want to come in my room?<eos> Okay.<eos> Can't do it like this.<eos> - What is it?<eos> What if they come in all of a sudden?<eos> - They won't.
He used to enchant the crew.<eos> The best thing is if you close your eyes and imagine that you are en Afrique.<eos> Yes.<eos> In Africa.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Do another one.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Very realistic.<eos> I hope you'll come see us at the earliest opportunity, Monsieur D'Arnot.<eos> Of course I will, sir.
Still missing two.<eos> A century ago, when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.<eos> So that's what you've got these slaves digging for, huh?<eos> They're innocent children.<eos> They dig for the gems to support our cause.<eos> They also search for the last two stones.<eos> Soon we will have all the five Sankara Stones, and the Thuggees will be all powerful.<eos> What a vivid imagination.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> You will, Dr. Jones.
- George, I can't get it open!<eos> - All right, now take it easy.<eos> Get him out!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Ed!<eos> - You should've let me die.<eos> - Hush, don't talk.<eos> I thought you abandoned us.<eos> You should've let me die.<eos> I won't.
- So what do you need?<eos> - Nothing Not me?<eos> I need you...<eos> I'm your mother, you're the one and only... who worked her life in all honesty...<eos> - And whoring all your life.<eos> - I did what? !<eos> - You heard. I did what?<eos> I didn't hear you.<eos> So just shut your mouth and get out...<eos> - I won't.
Yes, Sir.<eos> He's discovered something?<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> Relax.<eos> Did you hear the Zambuli shaman has come to town?<eos> Of course I've heard.<eos> I've had her arrested.<eos> Are you crazy? Why?<eos> What if Jabalani finds out?<eos> He never will.
Kent?<eos> Kent?<eos> Doesn't ring any bells.<eos> Doesn't even ring a--<eos> Oh, here it is.<eos> Big as life.<eos> "My dear Mr. Danvers. I'm writing on behalf of a very special young lady. "<eos> An orphan?<eos> Don't expect to be treated differently on that account, Miss Lee.<eos> Oh, no, sir. I won't.
Give me.<eos> They're mine.<eos> -What's on?<eos> -Give me my bottles.<eos> I saw them first.<eos> He has taken my bottles.<eos> I saw them earlier.<eos> You just arrived today.<eos> You must give him.<eos> -I won't.
- No!<eos> Moving on to relics, we've got shrouds from Turin, wine from the wedding at Cana, splinters from the Cross... and there's all the stuff made by Jesus in his days in the carpentry shop.<eos> Pipe racks, coffee tables, cake stands, book ends... crucifixes... a nice cheeseboard, fruit bowls, waterproof sandals...<eos> - I haven't finished this one yet.<eos> - Disgraceful!<eos> - They're obviously fake!<eos> - Ha!<eos> Yes.<eos> But how will people tell which are the real relics?<eos> They won't.
Step one ball to the end "<eos> Let us now with applause to welcome the<eos> "Dad love him love his mother"<eos> Playing locate orphans<eos> Shi--Jie Fang<eos> I have to wear this?<eos> Just to have to type<eos> As a version of the stresses on the line<eos> Thank you Thank you, I support the King<eos> Li also beloved uncle principals I will...
Well, we're here.<eos> Yeah, we are.<eos> Oh, you just look so grown-up in that new jacket. You do.<eos> - OK, Bones, take care.<eos> - Now... here is your bus ticket.<eos> - Jonathon!<eos> - Argh!<eos> - Take care of yourself.<eos> - I will.
You don't know anything about my life.<eos> When I first saw you in that bar... you were pathetic.<eos> You were a sympathy fuck.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You'd better go, Jonathon.<eos> Um, room service.<eos> It's room 1017.<eos> I'd like a bottle of vodka sent up right away.<eos> - Oh, that'll really help, won't it?<eos> - Yes, it will, Jonathon.
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.<eos> Oh, yes, Nurse.<eos> She knows you're coming.<eos> Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy.<eos> Herb?<eos> It's Johnny, Mom.<eos> Ohh...<eos> Johnny.<eos> Leave your boots outside the door. Don't go tracking snow all over the house.<eos> I won't.
- When? - How about tonight?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hanna?<eos> Hanna?<eos> Well... I did it.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm so excited I can't stop shaking.<eos> But what if I don't make it?<eos> You will.
I can assume any form I wish.<eos> Any form you wish.<eos> There's no love in that form.<eos> And you think there's love in your boy king?<eos> I've not held a man in my arms since my lover left.<eos> This is a lie!<eos> I know how painful it is to be far from your lover.<eos> He will betray you.<eos> Comfort me for one night.<eos> He will not.
Brains are so ugly.<eos> No.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'm late!<eos> Is that all you're gonna have for breakfast?<eos> It's all I have time for.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Oh, I'm fine.<eos> I just... Wish I could get out of this wheelchair so I could help a little around the house.<eos> You will.
The what?<eos> I got him.<eos> Almost as ugly as you are.<eos> He does have his good points.<eos> Can you wire the report in the morning?<eos> You keep your ass covered until I can get this arranged.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Kruger.<eos> - If Chief Jannings finds out...<eos> - He won't.
Is it terrible to say I can't stand seeing your mother get her hands on that little girl?<eos> I'd just love to raise that little girl.<eos> Look, I'd let you, but Teddy couldn't spare her.<eos> I can't stall any more, all right?<eos> You go out there and send the boys in.<eos> Well, do I get to say something ever?<eos> No.<eos> We don't have to do that, right? Come here.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You will.
You'll be assigned a corridor and washroom patrol in your free hours.<eos> Isn't that what the security guards are for?<eos> They're already using teacher salaries, Mr. Norris.<eos> We're spread thin at both ends.<eos> Well, I understand, sir, but I mean, I... I'd like to believe I'm here to teach. I need those free periods to do my work.<eos> You're not in Nebraska anymore, Mr. Norris.<eos> Here at Lincoln High... teaching is something you do in spite of everything else.<eos> - Understand?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> You will before long.
-It's only water.<eos> Cool water.<eos> There.<eos> -I saw you.<eos> -What?<eos> In the light.<eos> By the opening there.<eos> Standing in the light like an angel.<eos> Oh, dear God, if I could only get my strength back.<eos> You will. You will.
Fine, don't go to bed. But don't tell me how tired you are in the morning.<eos> What's this?<eos> Why do you keep buying toothpaste with stripes?<eos> You know I don't like stripes.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> I forgot.<eos> What is wrong with a simple, old-fashioned, plain toothpaste?<eos> I'll even go blue, as long as it doesn't have goddamn stripes!<eos> Look. Why don't you just do us a favor and buy your own fucking toothpaste?<eos> I will!
With our backs to the wall<eos> I am just a new boy<eos> A stranger in this town<eos> Where are all the good times<eos> Who 's gonna show this stranger around<eos> Ooooh<eos> I need a dirty woman<eos> Ooooh<eos> I need a dirty girl<eos> Will some woman in this desert land
It's like mine.<eos> It's a beautiful watch, yes?<eos> Dr. Kats, my boss, you know, his wife.<eos> Her family is in the jewelry business, so he took me over there in the car to get it engraved.<eos> It probably opens at the top, like mine. What?<eos> Don't get your fingers...<eos> You got your fingerprints all over it.<eos> I got nothing on that.<eos> Anyway, you think he will like that?<eos> Sure, he will.
Stop right here!<eos> I'll walk, you drive and I'll see you later!<eos> - Ok!<eos> I called you over here coz I didn't want to come to you til we finished doing a complete checkup.<eos> Was it the same killer?<eos> I think so.<eos> Only this time it was done with an axe!<eos> You didn't get the yellow envelope yet?<eos> Oh No!<eos> - You will!
You know, since my dad met you, he's your biggest fan.<eos> Is Ron coming too?<eos> Would that make a difference?<eos> Actually I think he has to stay in town and work.<eos> If it matters I've always hated women who treat other women as stand-ins for men.<eos> It's not that, really.<eos> I'd just like you to come.<eos> I just don't want to get up too soon, or I'll have another relapse.<eos> Isn't there some way we could rehearse and actually be in the same room together?<eos> We will. Right after the weekend.
It happened, but we can find a way out.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> I only wanted to set up at the plant... and find a nice place to live with you.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We'll hurry things up, no problem.<eos> Are you really happy?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I only want to live with you.<eos> And you will.
Morning.<eos> We seem to have... lost our train.<eos> - Two weeks.<eos> - Two weeks!<eos> Bugger it!<eos> Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.<eos> Hey, Arch, two weeks, that's not too long...<eos> - Arch, hang on!<eos> - Better take this.<eos> Hey, Archy, will ya...
- What?<eos> - The hotel makes profit.<eos> We get the money from the casino.<eos> Do you know what is it?<eos> Sure, that thing with prostitutes!<eos> I don`t need money from your parents, even if they are so rich.<eos> We could get married only if...<eos> - If?<eos> - If it would snow in august.<eos> It will.
- The bill.<eos> - I don`t want to leave.<eos> It`s early.<eos> - We have to go.<eos> - Let`s dance.<eos> - Better to go.<eos> Can`t we dance?<eos> I will dance alone.<eos> Somebody wants to dance with me?<eos> - I will.
115?<eos> I've seen ten create a fearful momentum and you have over 100 here. With weapons.<eos> - And some really don't want to be here...<eos> - You saw the muster yesterday.<eos> - They had a chance to leave, they stayed.<eos> - 11 kids did leave.<eos> Sounds like 11 boys who weren't much good to us anyway.<eos> I don't care what happened here.<eos> I don't wanna see scared kids crawling over the wall in the middle of the night.<eos> You won't.
Buck, I'm gonna miss you so much:<eos> I'm gonna miss you too:<eos> I brought you something:<eos> Oh, yeah? A going-away present?<eos> Well, sort of a "going-away" present and a "come-back-home-to-me-soon" present:<eos> Well, let me see what it is:<eos> It's beautiful:<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I thought maybe you could take it with you on your ship:<eos> I will:
At your service:<eos> Buck Rogers:<eos> Pleased to meet you, Buck:<eos> No, I just, uh: : :<eos> Do this to make a living:<eos> But in real life, I'm a magician:<eos> That's funny:<eos> I didn't even think magic existed anymore:<eos> But of course it does:<eos> And will:
Let me get at you again, wretch!<eos> You can do as you please.<eos> -I forbid you ever to come within my sight.<eos> As you like.<eos> I abandon you.<eos> Abandon me.<eos> I disown you.<eos> -Disown me.<eos> I disinherit you.<eos> As you will.
You'd be laying there aside him.<eos> I know that, Daddy.<eos> 'Course, if you had been workin' for him, at least you'd been workin'.<eos> That's all right, you did fine.<eos> Preacher Banks was supposed to be here to auction these pies.<eos> He's sick and I can't do it.<eos> I sure can't take no time.<eos> Besides, if these girls wanna eat pies with a boy, they'll do it whether there's an auction or not.<eos> Lady, I'll auction off them pies for you.<eos> You will?

Hey, wake up, Charlie.<eos> Where the hell you been?<eos> Shoppin'. Looks like you have too.<eos> Get all that crap off your face.<eos> I like it and it's staying.<eos> Where you goin'?<eos> Hold on, Mooney.<eos> This is my idea.<eos> If I wanna wear makeup, I'll wear it.<eos> The hell you will!
Well?<eos> This is very difficult.<eos> You'll think I'm pressuring you, using blackmail.<eos> You haven't said anything.<eos> I want you to let Jean come home...<eos> to me and the children.<eos> Not for good...<eos> Just for a few months.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...
You bothering' me about a steak?<eos> I agree.<eos> He should be with Tommy.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Tommy keeps telling me to work this out.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> - You are?<eos> I'm his brother.<eos> - Who better to talk to him?<eos> - I will.
Who is it?<eos> Richard Collier.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You sleep all right?<eos> - Wonderfully.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't sleep too well either.<eos> But I was on a porch chair, so...<eos> Don't you even have a room?<eos> Yes, I will, at 9:18.
We'll be late.<eos> Richard!<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I thought I lost you.<eos> - Oh, never.<eos> Never, never, never!<eos> You will marry me, won't you?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You won't?
Pierre.<eos> Come here.<eos> Don`t you forget to grow up now.<eos> -Good luck, brother.<eos> -Send me a picture postcard.<eos> Okay, Iet the boy go.<eos> -Bye.<eos> -We got work to do.<eos> And I hope you find whatever it is you`re looking for.<eos> I will, Ma.
Nothing is the matter.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your hand's sweaty.<eos> - When's Mommy coming back?<eos> - Soon. I told you.<eos> - Is she gonna pick me up?<eos> - Probably.<eos> If she doesn't, I will.<eos> - What if you forget?<eos> - I won't.
Her warriors won't be able to refuel, reload or land.<eos> - Fire in the bay. - Damage report.<eos> It's out of control.<eos> Alpha Bay is completely cut off.<eos> Keep leading her warriors away from the main fleet.<eos> They can't stay aloft using full battle thrusters for long.<eos> (Cylon) A word of caution.<eos> We too, are expending great amounts of fuel in a sustained attack.<eos> Yes, but we have a place to land. They do not.<eos> Or will not before long.
Better than anything. Well, almost anything.<eos> So, why didn't you turn professional?<eos> None of that stuff.<eos> There's too many rules. You're just a regular Tank Murdock.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - I know of him. He's from Denver and he's a regular institution.<eos> You bet he is.<eos> Now that is one guy I'd like to meet up with.<eos> Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.<eos> And you will.
It's Michael.<eos> He's...<eos> I have to go to him.<eos> What do you mean, you have to go to him?<eos> He's in a laundromat in Brooklyn.<eos> He's drunk.<eos> He just woke up there.<eos> - He may kill himself.<eos> - What if he kills you?<eos> He won't.
- I know something...<eos> - Katherine?<eos> - Could I say one thing?<eos> - Katherine!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - Katherine.<eos> - Just give me a minute, will you?<eos> Will you trust me?<eos> Will you please trust me?<eos> Will you?
- We got a hell of a tide.<eos> - Just take care of the crowd!<eos> Dad?<eos> Mr Hendricks, take this down, please.<eos> - No more sailing today, OK?<eos> - We came out in my boat.<eos> - Andy'll take it back.<eos> - I got a date.<eos> - She'll understand.<eos> - She won't.
You will give me a name some day. And I live in terror of that day.<eos> - Why speak so mysteriously?<eos> I am happy in your company.<eos> Give me your hand!<eos> I want to touch you.<eos> - No!<eos> - We torment each other.<eos> You have never dined with me.<eos> Never drank a toast with me.<eos> Will you now?
Maybe we should leave.<eos> We're staying.<eos> But there may be a better way.<eos> - Let me come with you. - No.<eos> They know you too well.<eos> It'll be better if I go alone.<eos> Now get those holes filled in.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> They'll take us back to Efrafa.<eos> Their Owsla will.
Her belly is large.<eos> She'll have the kid soon.<eos> Before the next moon.<eos> Maybe twins.<eos> If she had twins, you would find some way to take the credit.<eos> My breakfast bowl is empty now.<eos> Feed the goats.<eos> -All right.<eos> -Take care.<eos> Yes, I will.
Last on Roots:<eos> My breakfast bowl is empty now.<eos> - There are goats to be fed.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Yes, Father.<eos> I will.
Yes. It's‒ It's warm.<eos> Your hat is also fur?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll look.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Nice with coat.<eos> You would put on?<eos> You would put on.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
We are what we are.<eos> Am I like you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Now, listen, shouldn't you call home?<eos> - I'd only wake Ethan.<eos> Emma, I've stayed at Yuri's a lot.<eos> Emilia, you continually surprise me.<eos> And me.<eos> I wish I knew who I was.<eos> - You will.
'We're alive.'<eos> - All of you?<eos> - 'Yes.<eos> Get those supplies ready.'<eos> They are ready, sir.<eos> What assurance do I have, Gwent, that you will release us once the supplies are delivered?<eos> 'Assurance?<eos> Your famous word of honour?<eos> 'If that will do.'<eos> It won't!
Come on, let's get back to the farmhouse.<eos> Oh, God, forgive me for doing bad things.<eos> I swear, I won't sin again if you just return my husband to me.<eos> A doctor ought to be taking care of this, Mrs. Skinner.<eos> The Lord healeth the sick, Lorna.<eos> That's from the Bible.<eos> Yeah, well, I think maybe you should drive back with us tonight<eos> Oh, no, I can't do that.<eos> When Mr. Skinner returns, he'll want me to be here.<eos> He will.
Well, you gotta stand there all the day?<eos> C'mon in!<eos> Welcome home, son!<eos> You've been gone quite a while this time.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Fighting at war.<eos> You winned it or lose it?<eos> I just happened to be in the winning side.<eos> -Did you see anybody faster than you?<eos> Maybe I never will.
I don't wanna hit you again.<eos> They're fucking your daughter!<eos> - Let me shoot.<eos> - What about Susan?<eos> I'll get closer.<eos> I won't miss.<eos> For the love of God.<eos> He didn't come.<eos> He should've.<eos> He will.
I won't miss.<eos> For the love of God.<eos> He didn't come.<eos> He should've.<eos> He will.<eos> If he doesn't come for her by sunrise, string her up to this tree.<eos> And when he sees her jerking on them ropes, he'll come.<eos> - He'll come.<eos> - What if he don't?<eos> He will.
Yes. But parts coated with a graphite compound won't corrode.<eos> How long to strip down one Eagle and graphite the parts?<eos> Three days.<eos> They've started already.<eos> They'll have to do it in two.<eos> I don't know if this is friend or foe but get it out of here.<eos> You're getting better.<eos> You're going to be all right.<eos> I thought we had found our home.<eos> we will. we will.
One occasion brought the welcome appearance of his second in the fatal duel Captain Grogan.<eos> It would have helped if we'd known what had become of you.<eos> Didn't you think of writing to your mother?<eos> Of course.<eos> But the shame I felt of losing her money my father's sword and pistols... I couldn't tell her.<eos> She wouldn't care about those things.<eos> You are her only concern.<eos> Tonight you must write her a proper letter.<eos> Tell her that you're safe and well.<eos> I will.
Major Claremont.<eos> Deakin must have got to him.<eos> Where in God's name can they be?<eos> In the supply wagon.<eos> We've looked everywhere else.<eos> Find 'em and kill 'em.<eos> Both.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I want to see those rifles.<eos> - You will.
We'll have you out in a few hours.<eos> - A few hours?<eos> - Why don't you give them what they want?<eos> They'll get it.<eos> We want to be sure we get what we want.<eos> Let's get you all out of here safe.<eos> You two boys too.<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Tell the TV to stop saying there's 2 homosexuals in here.<eos> I will.
In a deep well.<eos> She had many adventures.<eos> Go on.<eos> What was in the well?<eos> Sir Stephen.<eos> My hands.<eos> I love you.<eos> She won't look.<eos> She will.<eos> No, she won't.
Bring two.<eos> Your father has been unfaithful to me.<eos> He was one of my best customers till a couple of years ago.<eos> I told you your pa was a hell-raiser.<eos> For warren Maxwell's charming son tonight is compliments of the house.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You lucky bastard.<eos> I never got it free in my whole life.<eos> Never will, either, probably.
Didn't Trout tell you you're supposed to strip?<eos> I'm a singer!<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen, listen, listen.<eos> Go finish the show like you told Trout you'd do, and I'll set it up so you can sing at the Parthenon.<eos> You can sing in the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.<eos> - Go finish the show...<eos> - I get to sing with Barbara Jean?<eos> Yes, you are...<eos> Yes, you will.
This President Roosevelt, he would try and take it himself?<eos> He certainly would.<eos> He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber.<eos> He does not kidnap women and children!<eos> - What kind of rifle does he use?<eos> - A Winchester.<eos> Winchester?<eos> Winchester?<eos> - I have no knowledge of this rifle.<eos> - You will.
That's what I wanted to hear!<eos> - Look!<eos> Look what I found!<eos> - What?<eos> - Kraik, now, take it easy now,<eos> Come on.<eos> That's not gonna solve anything.<eos> If you eat all the food now, what about tomorrow?<eos> I'm hungry now, I don't care about tomorrow.<eos> But you will... tomorrow.
- How nice. Come, Protus.<eos> I've had a new book sent from Central City.<eos> I'm sure you'll be interested.<eos> Oh, Carsia, I'll be with you in one minute.<eos> I do want to take one last look at this marvelous bird.<eos> Very well.<eos> - "Protus"?<eos> Never you mind about that.<eos> Your glider will not fly.<eos> - It will.
It's nice to meet you, Audrey.<eos> Tell me, how did all this happen?<eos> It was just a big mistake.<eos> - Big mistake.<eos> - Whose?<eos> The store's.<eos> Doris, come on, let's go.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Ramada Rose is upset, so you tell Tommy I said goodbye.<eos> Yes, I will.
He likes you.<eos> Hey, listen, Lieutenant,<eos> I like him, too, but I just can't seem to get any work done.<eos> Does anybody else have a key to Mr. Ross's car?<eos> Yeah. I've got duplicates to all of them.<eos> But just about anybody could've sneaked in here last night and grabbed Ross's key off the board.<eos> Where were you between 8:00 and 9:00 last night?<eos> I went to a drive-in movie with a kid.<eos> Well, I guess it's as good an alibi as Dr. Cahill's, if the kid will confirm it.<eos> He sure will.
Her body temperature is elevated 3.9 degrees.<eos> She's burning up.<eos> And I'm detecting elevated levels of electrophoretic activity in her nervous system.<eos> You have to bring them down.<eos> There is increased electrophoretic activity in the ship's atmosphere, probably created by the creatures we're studying.<eos> You mean, there's a connection between what's happening to Kes and those creatures?<eos> You have to do something about it!<eos> You are making it impossible for me to think, much less treat my patient.<eos> You must leave.<eos> I won't.
The Starship Potemkin has already picked up the drug and will transfer it to a freighter, the S.S. Huron, for delivery to the Enterprise.<eos> What will the symptoms be, Bones?<eos> lncreasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.<eos> Kind of like the test you had to pass back at the Academy.<eos> Come.<eos> -You wished to see me, sir?<eos> -Yes, Spock, sit down.<eos> We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the drug you need.<eos> I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb V.<eos> No, it won't.
- What do you expect?<eos> - Exoneration!<eos> Exoneration!<eos> Your protection was no good for me to be at my child's wake or to have my wife with me.<eos> In due course!<eos> I can't...!<eos> Enough!<eos> I've had enough humiliation!<eos> - You know I can't do it!<eos> - Then others will!
And for 50 cents.<eos> I never ate anything so good.<eos> I ain't shitting you.<eos> I'm gonna have to have another one.<eos> - I'd like a little more onion.<eos> - Here.<eos> How about some of these?<eos> You got it.<eos> We gotta figure out what we're gonna do.<eos> And we will.

That's a... a bit of luck.<eos> Good luck, for both of us.<eos> The cards say we will be lovers.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Forbidden for me.<eos> Now you must go.<eos> But you do believe,... I mean really believe in the cards?<eos> They have never lied to me.<eos> Then they won't now.
I don't suppose you can wait here by yourself, can you?<eos> You hungry?<eos> Want a Nehi and a Coney island?<eos> - Ain't you eating?<eos> - I ain't hungry.<eos> You worried about going on the train?<eos> You'II like it.<eos> You'II soon be at your aunt's and all your troubles over. So, eat up.<eos> - She don't know me.<eos> - She will.
It's on my leg! Goddamn it!<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Come on, one more.<eos> - I'm already so drunk I can't think.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> I want you to put this between your teeth.<eos> It's going to hurt you.<eos> - lf you want to yell, you yell.<eos> - I certainly will.
Oh.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> It came out of the biggest shark ever caught in the Gulf of Mexico.<eos> I caught it.<eos> Bring you luck.<eos> Old Peg.<eos> He was born to set a bad example.<eos> Now you remember me that way.<eos> You hear?<eos> I will, Peg.
We're getting quite human.<eos> It's a pity we ever met in the first place and decided to live together - what a glorious fiasco!<eos> The sooner we sign the papers, the better.<eos> We'll divide our worldly goods and go our separate ways.<eos> It was all just a ghastly mistake.<eos> I know what's on your mind.<eos> - You don't want a divorce!<eos> - That's absurd!<eos> - Then sign the papers.<eos> - All right, I will.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> I started thinking about what I was letting myself in for.<eos> It's not too late to change your mind.<eos> Let you and the others go alone?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> - I told you before, Mr. Lane, that I...<eos> - You don't trust me.<eos> Can't say as I blame you.<eos> You realize if anything should happen to me on the way...<eos> - It won't.
- Not if I turn and run. - You won't.<eos> You're going to spend the rest of your life getting up one more time... than you're knocked down, so you better start getting used to it.<eos> If any trouble starts, under there.<eos> Cooking coffee again.<eos> Like hell!<eos> Get under there.<eos> - Ten men. - So far.<eos> - Maybe they'll give it up. - They should.<eos> - They can't shoot worth a damn.<eos> - But they won't.
The world has yet to hear a word about the her story... with a Swiss bank.<eos> There hasn't been a breath... about funny passports or phoney signatures and here's... Edith telling CIifford Irving that she can't believe EImyr had... anything to do with fakery.<eos> That's why I never could think or really believe that he... really did those paintings.<eos> It's a good drawing.<eos> If he did it, my compliment.<eos> should we burn it ?<eos> And I only hope there are more people who do them.<eos> Irving's book about EImyr is the story of a man of talent... taking the mickey out of those who were rejected, and transforming... disappointments into a gigantic joke.<eos> Do you thinK I should Keep it for my old age?<eos> AII right, I will.
Don't move.<eos> You are the last.<eos> Come.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> They are still very hospitable.<eos> But this is not my group.<eos> Typical of these provincial bull-fights, "corridas".<eos> We didn't do anything.<eos> Will it come out?<eos> - Yes, it will.
It wasn't me.<eos> I'm only saying that the clan needs a young leader.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - (Hudson) No.<eos> She is right. lt is time for me to step down.<eos> And for you to lead.<eos> It was your skills that led us to the archmage.<eos> I cannot take command now.<eos> - lt's time, my friend.<eos> - Then I will.
Ain't that a wonderment.<eos> That damn train's done jumped the track.<eos> CHARLEY:<eos> I brought it just to show you all it's a pleasure to be doing business with you here in Northfield.<eos> I'd like to dedicate this first song to all the folks of Northfield who've done business with us. And to those who will do business with us in the future.<eos> We'll have it working soon, folks.<eos> Come back later.<eos> Just a few minor adjustments.<eos> You said it would work.<eos> It will. It will.
No wonder he's feeling poorly.<eos> Tell him I'm coming to see him tonight.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Why can't I do that?<eos> I've been coming to see your grandpa regular since before you were born.<eos> Well...<eos> Because he's going to be out tonight.<eos> Then, I'll see him tomorrow.<eos> Maybe Mr. Gutteridge won't come tomorrow.<eos> 'Course he will.
When will you be back?<eos> I, uh... I don't know.<eos> We'll have to see how it works out.<eos> I'll, um... I'll phone you.<eos> Did you say good night to the kids? No.<eos> I was just going to.<eos> Good night, daddy.<eos> Good-bye, darling.<eos> Don't forget to ring me when you get there.<eos> I will.
Not afraid.<eos> I just don't trust them.<eos> Any of them.<eos> It sounds like some man didn't treat you too kindly.<eos> Only I would've bet that you'd never been in love.<eos> Too bad you couldn't have bet.<eos> You'd have won.<eos> How'd you get your unfair opinion of men?<eos> I'd rather not talk about it.<eos> We won't, then.
Look, your brother's dead and gone.<eos> They're hard nuts up there, Jack.<eos> They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his nose in.<eos> -Too bad.<eos> -Remember, they're killers.<eos> Just like you.<eos> The police seem satisfied.<eos> Since when was that good enough?<eos> Think again, Jack.<eos> I will.
Is there something I can do for you?<eos> Do you have anything to eat?<eos> I'm bloody starving.<eos> It took six hours to get up here in that flipping contraption.<eos> You'll have to forgive me.<eos> My kitchen ain't in operation yet.<eos> I could take you up to the restaurant, if you're hungry enough.<eos> I'm hungry enough.<eos> I could eat a bloody horse.<eos> - At Sheehan's place, you probably will.
It's his stomach.<eos> -He's blocking the chocolate!<eos> -What happens now?<eos> The pressure will get him out.<eos> It's building up behind the blockage.<eos> I wonder how long it's going to take?<eos> The suspense is terrible.<eos> I hope it'll last.<eos> He'll never get out.<eos> Yes, he will.
-Name your price.<eos> She can't have one.<eos> Who says I can't?<eos> -The man with the hat.<eos> -l want one!<eos> I want a golden goose!<eos> Gooses!<eos> Geeses!<eos> I want my geese to lay gold eggs for Easter.<eos> -lt will, sweetheart.
- I wish he had.<eos> The way you shoot that gun, can you teach me?<eos> - What for, you wanna kill somebody?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Horse shit.<eos> You couldn't go off and leave a man on the cold ground last night.<eos> - I'll learn.<eos> - You'll forget is what you'll do.<eos> Whatever it is that happened to you, you'll forget it.<eos> - The hell I will.
Yeah, well, I heard about them sheepherders and you ain't sticking my feet in your boots.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> I want that son of a bitch.<eos> I'll pay a hundred dollars in gold, wet or dry, dead or alive.<eos> A hundred dollars?<eos> - If I see him, you'll get him.<eos> - I better.<eos> So long, fella.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
Away with her husband.<eos> - Are they French too?<eos> - No. No. They gave me their apartment for the summer.<eos> You sure you're all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Doctor, how long has this stuff been going on?<eos> Quite a while.<eos> Does anybody besides you know who the thing is happening to?<eos> - I mean, you know, who the nut is?<eos> - No. And no one ever will.
He ain't no passenger.<eos> He's out of sight now, anyway.<eos> What the eye don't see the heart need take no notice of, that what I always say.<eos> Come on then.<eos> He's gone in the tunnel.<eos> Oh, it is dark in here.<eos> They don't know what they're in for.<eos> It isn't easy running in the dark.<eos> They'll take a long time going through, won't they?<eos> Aye, they will that.
But, Colonel, this is planter's stock. Jamaican rum.<eos> - I paid dear for this.<eos> - And you charge dear for it.<eos> Give us that stuff on the bottom shelf.<eos> Give me the bottle.<eos> Colonel, I know why you want to see us.<eos> You haven't found the fella who told us about your gold shipments.<eos> Who sold you the information about our gold shipments.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But I will.
You did a beautiful job, Beckman.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Thank you, major.<eos> I still don't think we should defend- - Destroy the castle.<eos> I warned you about thinking, Beckman.<eos> Yes, major.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> What do you see out there, Beckman?<eos> -No Krauts yet, sir.<eos> -You never will.
On days...<eos> (tyres screech)<eos> (door clangs)<eos> - Cheerio, lads!<eos> - Quiet, Croker!<eos> You're not out yet.<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - Good luck, Charles.<eos> Remember me to the old woman!<eos> - I will, Harry, I will.
Is that it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Heavy burden to carry, isn't it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You may have to live with that feeling.<eos> - For the rest of my life?<eos> - No, for a while.<eos> - I can't, Boss.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> You will.
-That's Ken Harper.<eos> You'll find him up ahead, scouting out a place to noon.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Paul Carden.<eos> -Do you know him?<eos> -I used to.<eos> In a way.<eos> Circle your wagons!<eos> Circle your wagons!<eos> We'll noon here!
And someone else was there. A soldier.<eos> A man?<eos> Of course, he was a man.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> Yes...<eos> I understand.<eos> What I don't understand is where were you all night.<eos> Now you'll have to get married, and posthaste!<eos> Come hell or high water, I won't get married!<eos> Oh yes, you will!
For the hand that slew Fred Carson and Stoney Burough, I sought the Lord's forgiveness.<eos> But for the limitless evil of him who slew Mace Jones, I ask for limitless punishment for he took a man's life in God's House.<eos> Let us pray, therefore, that heaven receives the soul of Mace Jones, and that the soul of his killer wander the darkness for ever.<eos> All men being sinful and Thou just,<eos> I pray You regard any score against Mace Jones as even.<eos> Strike it from Thy books and let him sleep.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I didn't hear you praying, Little George.<eos> You never will, either.
Now, Barbarella, don´t you agree with me that in some things, the old-fashioned ways are best?<eos> What...?<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Yes, I must admit it ws rather interesting.<eos> Still, it is distracting.<eos> - Are you coming with me to Sogo?<eos> - No, I prefer the tranquility of Weir.<eos> Sogo is too strict, the people too dedicated.<eos> Perhaps you´ll stop here again... at the end of your mission.<eos> Yes, perhaps I will...
We are. I am. I will.<eos> He was surely right that when there is danger it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth that are best able to able to defend it.<eos> I am an old man, Airey and I've only got one arm to fight the war with.<eos> It won't be enough.<eos> Duberly says it's going to be war.<eos> He says the Russians will fight and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.<eos> Duberly says I can go with the army.<eos> I can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which I am. lsn't it exciting?<eos> -William wants to go.<eos> -Soldiers will.
Why do you think I gave the necklace all that publicity?<eos> He'll never be able to resist those emeralds.<eos> Now we'll sit back and wait to spring the trap.<eos> Sir Harold. lf you don't mind, I'd like to check your room again.<eos> - Please do.<eos> - How romantic.<eos> It makes me think I'm living in the old days of Robin Hood.<eos> When I return to London, I will have such exciting things<eos> - to tell to my friends.<eos> - You will, indeed.
–That's nice.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> We were going to Florida next winter without the kids.<eos> Now they're going without me.<eos> OK, come on, boys.<eos> Good night.<eos> –One of us should stay.<eos> –It's OK.<eos> Suppose he tries something again.<eos> –He won't.
- Hey, gringo, that's me!<eos> Learning pretty fast, pretty fast.<eos> - Yeah, you're all right.<eos> You'll be able to write your will before they shoot your tail all over that parade ground.<eos> You've got to know something I don't.<eos> Answer me. You made a deal with Huerta, huh?<eos> - He won't let it happen.<eos> - Oh, he won't?<eos> How?<eos> - He won't!
- But you'll be much better off, I think.<eos> - We will die. No, you'll live and develop as you should have.<eos> All this shouldn't have been done for you.<eos> Now the women here below and the men here above will control together.<eos> - They will not help us without the pain.<eos> - There are other ways.<eos> You'll discover them.<eos> You must move to the surface, you understand.<eos> - We will die above in the cold.<eos> - No, you won't.
And I am quite good at self-defence too.<eos> This can be set for stun and destroy too, like yours.<eos> Please, accept what has happened.<eos> There is nothing you can do to change it.<eos> If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights, take out that device in the life-support system?<eos> Don't be so silly.<eos> You'll feel better about it all in a little while.<eos> It always happens this way.<eos> They are very upset at first, then it wears off, then they learn to like it.<eos> You will too.
Your coat.<eos> I'll make you a trade. What have you got?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's a deal!<eos> You must believe me. I've told you everything.<eos> Then where are your clothes?<eos> That I can't tell you.<eos> Why not?<eos> You won't believe me.<eos> I will.
Why are you so offended?<eos> Because you know a pistolero is in love with you?<eos> I envy you.<eos> I only wish he felt that way about me.<eos> I would know what to do. Go to him, señora.<eos> It cannot be.<eos> What exactly you got there, Mr. Trent?<eos> Just a little something I got stashed away for a rainy day.<eos> Well, it ain't raining yet.<eos> It will.
- Better fall in and join them.<eos> It's true that I've been blessed... with an insight into women that others don't have.<eos> And sometimes...<eos> Well, sometimes I'm called upon... to use it in our beloved master's will.<eos> If women are your special province, why do you hate Major Reisman so much?<eos> There are 11 evil men out there... and they must be punished for their wickedness.<eos> And this Major Reisman, he just snatched them up... from the brink of the pit, and he cheated the master of his vengeance.<eos> And you think that's what God wants?<eos> To punish these men?<eos> Oh, he will, captain. He will. And Major Reisman too.
Well, of all the lawmen on my trail these days, they're the most troublesome.<eos> They could make up a story like yours.<eos> I understand.<eos> But this'll prove that I don't have anything to do with them.<eos> A Pinkertons' man would've shot the both of you by now.<eos> Who'd stop him?<eos> I would.<eos> I admit you're plenty smart and that's the main reason why I want to work for you.<eos> I haven't begun my recruiting.<eos> And maybe I never will.
Well, get him.<eos> Go on, hurry.<eos> Shepherd Oak, missus.<eos> I won't have him on this farm.<eos> How about Farmer Boldwood?<eos> He'll know.<eos> He haven't got the touch, saving your presence, not with animals.<eos> They'll all be as dead as nits if they bain't be gut out and cured.<eos> I won't have him on this farm.<eos> I won't.

If this were back east, I could make law the way they do.<eos> But the best thing I can do out here is buy it.<eos> You get good value, don't you?<eos> It's been working.<eos> It works until the east gets here.<eos> But if I'm not big enough to buck them when they start to corner the ranges and the railroads and the stockyards, you boys are going to have to go back to living on what the county pays you.<eos> But meanwhile...<eos> Meanwhile, if we don't wanna get eaten up, we're going to have to grow bigger and faster than nature intended.<eos> Yeah... and hope their brothers don't continue to be so lucky as they were this morning.<eos> They won't.
Who did that?<eos> Flood.<eos> It's not important.<eos> It is to me.<eos> Howdy, Ryan. - How are ya?<eos> You're Marshal Hickman.<eos> I heard about you-<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Even if you heard about me from your daddy.<eos> No, sir. I won't.
See, she won´t listen to me. She just won´t.<eos> Why doesn´t her father talk with her?<eos> We´re divorced.<eos> He doesn´t... lt´s not wrong to...<eos> When your marriage breaks up, life doesn´t end, does it?<eos> Please talk to her, Sir.<eos> I´m frightened for her.<eos> You never know what sort of trouble she can get into.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, I will.
Well, gentlemen...<eos> I take it that it's up to me to pay the piper.<eos> Gentlemen, I have heard your opinions.<eos> Some of you will not agree with me, but I... I, by the authority entrusted in me by my Czar and my country, give the order to retreat.<eos> This I did not expect!<eos> This I never thought of!<eos> You should get some rest, Your Highness.<eos> Oh no!<eos> I shall make them eat horsemeat, just like the Turks!<eos> They will, too! If only...
Maybe I was right at first.<eos> Maybe a mouse like you is better dead.<eos> Easy, do not fret, Ryan.<eos> What do you want?<eos> 15,000.<eos> What?<eos> 1,000 for each year in prison.<eos> In cash.<eos> Where do you think I'm going to get that kind of money?<eos> Oh, you will.
99: What did he say, Max?<eos> He says that unless I deliver the real X11 to him within two hours, he's going to kill The Chief.<eos> What are you going to do, Max? We can't exchange the X11 for The Chief.<eos> No, but we can exchange the most important man in KAOS for him--<eos> - Karl Danker.<eos> - Their number one assassin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But how are we going to do that, Max?<eos> We don't have Karl Danker.<eos> We will, 99.
I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE ONCE BEFORE, 99.<eos> IT'S THE WRONG DRAPE.<eos> COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!<eos> - NOT YOU, MAX.<eos> - OH.<eos> WELL, IT'S OUR OLD FRIEND THE HANDYMAN.<eos> IT'S NOT ON HIM, 99.<eos> SO YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE DIARY EITHER.<eos> DON'T WORRY.<eos> WE WILL.
Give me a camel, I can get out of anything. You're a responsible spy.<eos> Send your telegram.<eos> You're bringing these people nothing but false hopes... and false expectations.<eos> There are still 13,000 Egyptians to be got out of Khartoum.<eos> If the government had known that by now... there'd be armed Mahdis tribes on both sides of the Nile... 400 miles north of Khartoum-- They wouldn't have sent me.<eos> Then you cannot proceed further.<eos> If Her Majesty's government... at this moment wants to run out publicly... on the Egyptians, send your telegram.<eos> Get them to recall me.<eos> But you have to make the decision.<eos> They won't.
All right, I will.<eos> I've longed for you.<eos> I've searched for you.<eos> I've dreamed of you.<eos> Don't, Christian, don't!<eos> You've asked me to be serious.<eos> I honor that request. I welcome it!<eos> You don't know where I came from or why I wanted to die.<eos> You never once asked.<eos> I never will.
- Fisher for me.<eos> - Aye, but for the King?<eos> What about my secretary, Master Cromwell?<eos> Cromwell. He's a very able man.<eos> But?<eos> Me rather than Cromwell.<eos> Then, come down to earth.<eos> Until you do... you and I are enemies.<eos> As Your Grace wishes.<eos> As God wills.
You did, huh?<eos> A couple of months ago he rode through here, up to no good.<eos> Headed north.<eos> How'd he look?<eos> Mean as you.<eos> The kind somebody's always looking for.<eos> - I hope you keep on looking.<eos> - You do, huh?<eos> Yeah, because then you'll be moving on as soon as your horse gets shod.<eos> - You will, won't you?
You will take your seats one minute after the house lights go down.<eos> At first intermission, you'll be taken through the pass door backstage by the baggage master of the company.<eos> He will know you, because he has your seat numbers.<eos> Well, is he one of your men?<eos> No, but he wants to defect, too, so we're going to give him a little help.<eos> Here it is.<eos> You'll recognize him.<eos> He has red hair which is not his own, and his name is Hugo, but don't give him that money until after you've landed.<eos> Listen, if we don't get a chance to see you again...<eos> You won't, mister.
I take it that it's up to me to pay the piper.<eos> Gentlemen, I have heard your opinions.<eos> Some of you will not agree with me, but I...<eos> I, by the authority entrusted in me by my Czar and my country, give the order to retreat.<eos> This I did not expect!<eos> This I never thought of!<eos> You should get some rest, Your Highness.<eos> Oh no!<eos> I shall make them eat horsemeat, just like the Turks!<eos> They will, too! If only...
- Harry, what's happening?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - Would you mind waiting outside?<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> Answer every question.<eos> Don't lie. You've no need to.<eos> Don't submit to a med...<eos> Being so healthy they've no need for a medical exam.<eos> - What if they ask about...<eos> - They won't.
This time it will not be Leslie.<eos> It will be I, Professor Fate!<eos> Fate the Magnificent!<eos> And it is with no little pride that the Webber Motor Car Company unveils its latest and greatest achievement.<eos> Gentlemen, behold the motor car of the future!<eos> Holy cow!<eos> Holy Toledo, look at that car!<eos> Yes, it's quite a car.<eos> - I never saw a car like that in my life.<eos> - You never will again either.
- I'm glad you think so.<eos> Stand up!<eos> If we're not back in two hours, don't wait for us.<eos> If you hear any shots, leave immediately.<eos> There is nine minutes left.<eos> - Go on to the boathouse with Knut.<eos> - Where are you going? I've got to see that the ferry leaves on time.<eos> Then I'll join you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
We're joining the Juaristas at Guaymas.<eos> I came here to reassure myself that you were still alive.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> You should be careful.<eos> The French police is already suspicious of this place.<eos> Wait.<eos> If I ever do get out of here...<eos> The war won't last forever.<eos> It will for you, Major.
- I've got to find out. Watch out for her.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Governor's not happy, but you'll have a power cut all over the island.<eos> I don't give a damn about the rest of the island.<eos> - I just want the lights out in Palmyra.<eos> - You'll have it.<eos> What do you mean, she won't talk?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She will.
But look at this picture!<eos> I don't look remotely like this chap.<eos> No.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> absolutely not.<eos> That's better.<eos> Now let's see you walk.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - Yes, it will.
We haven't had a martyr in the family since the Salem trials.<eos> What did you do to what's-his-name, besides bruise his ego a bit?<eos> - Isn't that enough?<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> It isn't nonsense.<eos> He thought my ideas were witchcraft.<eos> - Well, weren't they?<eos> - No!<eos> But he doesn't believe me.<eos> He never will.
My loyalties are to the king, his daughter and his ship.<eos> That sounds very honourable but how does that fit in with your arrangements with Mansuh?<eos> As long as he looks for the bell, the ship and girl are safe.<eos> I see.<eos> - And what are your plans for me?<eos> - King Harald must decide.<eos> So until he finds us, we fight the same battle?<eos> We do.<eos> That is, of course, if he ever does find us.<eos> He will.
I hope to have a solution to such a dilemma. - Oh?<eos> - I intend to go onto Rome to put my case before the Holy Father, if you will give me safe conduct.<eos> You shall have it, of course. You're the ideal guest.<eos> But might I be permitted to give you a word of advice?<eos> - I would appreciate it.<eos> - The Pope is a most holy man, but like so many lofty personages, he is surrounded by men of a somewhat inferior stamp.<eos> They need money.<eos> And King Henry might be willing to provide it.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> I will.
- Now, please listen to me.<eos> Please.<eos> You've made one of the most heroic marches in history.<eos> You deserve to go back to your homeland and stay there in peace.<eos> I'm sure that the people of this country will understand and will agree when they hear the facts.<eos> Now will you take the gamble?<eos> The people?<eos> Who will tell them?<eos> Who will tell the people about Fort Robinson?<eos> I will.
- I m sorry.<eos> - But I Iike the idea. It s new faces in the act.<eos> So, don t worry.<eos> I know how to handle him.<eos> He always does the right thing.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Aman is lucky to have a smart woman to guide him.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> - I II expect your news.<eos> You will?
- Laundry pickup.<eos> - Good morning, Jerome.<eos> - It's over there.<eos> - Good morning. Thank you.<eos> You're new here, aren't you, miss?<eos> Then I hope you like it here.<eos> - Will I see you again?<eos> - I'm the orderly on this shift.<eos> Will I see you again?<eos> Well, yes, you will.
There's a lunar eclipse on the 12th.<eos> You know, when the Earth passes between the sun and moon.<eos> That's obviously a resting time for the Selenites.<eos> Time you rested too, Miss Callender.<eos> - It's a long time since we landed.<eos> - An eternity.<eos> Mr. Cavor, I'm so worried about Arnold.<eos> Yes, Arnold.<eos> - Will we see our world again?<eos> - Of course we will.
Inspector may I ask you a question?<eos> - Please do.<eos> - If you had simply found that note in the victim's dressing room and knew no more about it than that what would you have made of the affair?<eos> Well, I suppose I'd have thought the man was being blackmailed and had decided to end it all.<eos> Yes, that's what I thought you'd have thought.<eos> It could be the note was left there deliberately so that you would think that.<eos> Miss Marple, it's been a long, hard day already.<eos> - What are you suggesting now? - I am suggesting that the murderer of Mrs. McGinty and the murderer of George Rowton are one and the same.<eos> As to who murdered George Rowton, I don't yet know.<eos> But I will.
You seem to remember her well, Mr. Tumbrill.<eos> What is your interest in her?<eos> Oh, I simply want to trace her.<eos> You see, I've been outside the profession for a number of years now. - And so the only way I...<eos> - Well if you're an old friend of hers, I'm afraid you're in for a bit of a shock.<eos> - Poor Rosie was hanged, you know.<eos> - What? Yes.<eos> Terrible business.<eos> Terrible business.<eos> Will you?
Yes!<eos> It was me!<eos> I was wrong!<eos> Forgive me!<eos> I wore the mask to scare you.<eos> I'm being punished for it!<eos> The mask won't come off!<eos> Why won't it?<eos> Why won't it?<eos> Why won't it?
I'm being punished for it!<eos> The mask won't come off!<eos> Why won't it?<eos> Why won't it?<eos> Why won't it?<eos> It got wet in the rain and won't come off!<eos> Take it off!<eos> Why won't it come off?<eos> Why won't it?<eos> Why won't it?
The upstairs maid couldn't get to this one either.<eos> - So I see.<eos> - How about a chair?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I shouldn't keep you in suspense.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I'm enjoying the view.<eos> My name is Marian Stevens.<eos> - Don't ring no bell with me.<eos> - It will.
The attitude of the village, the remarkable resemblance... between him and the figure in the portrait... the atmosphere of the castle are all working together... to cause this aberration.<eos> Then I've got to find a way to help him.<eos> You're not going back in there?<eos> Yes. What else can I do?<eos> Leave him?<eos> I would advise it.<eos> But, then, of course, you can't.<eos> No.<eos> Promise me one thing-- that you'll contact me if things get out of hand.<eos> Yes, I will, doctor.
This boy is a saint.<eos> Only respectable and important people come to my house!<eos> That one who's ringing now, do you know who he is?<eos> The son ofthe Labor Minister Rusconi!<eos> A fine thing.<eos> Members ofcongress come to my house too!<eos> Imagine that.<eos> Even Tommasi, the pasta producer.<eos> I see you eat Tommasi pasta.<eos> I won't anymore.
- The window, I'm jumping.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Rusconi.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - Mr. Rusconi.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> Don't you know? Umberto studied all the time.<eos> He even read at night.<eos> You know he could have become Pope?<eos> He will, he will.
Whatever I spell to Helen, I'd better spell right.<eos> - You've taught her so much this week.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> Obedience isn't enough.<eos> Well... she learned two nouns this morning. Key and water.<eos> - But not...?<eos> - No.<eos> Not that they mean things.<eos> It's still a finger game to her.<eos> No meaning. But she will.
That means she's still my wife.<eos> come on, honey, let's go home.<eos> She stays with us.<eos> Looks to me like you been having some trouble.<eos> Looks to me like somebody got their finger caught in the cookie jar.<eos> You're short-handed, old-timer, but she's all we want.<eos> All we want, provided we get her now.<eos> - You heard me.<eos> - We'll get her, sooner or later.<eos> Like hell you will!
In Tangier.<eos> - Blackmail, is it?<eos> - That's very ugly language.<eos> The language of the gutter is understood by anyone who ever fell in it.<eos> Price?<eos> I just want you to live up to this contract.<eos> - And that's not all.<eos> - Money?<eos> - And if I refuse?<eos> - Well, you won't.
And from now on any penny that comes out of it or goes into it is for you to look after, for you to decide.<eos> It ain't much, but it's all I got in the world.<eos> And I'm putting it in your hands.<eos> And I'm telling you, son that from now on, you be the head of this family the way you supposed to be.<eos> Do you trust me like that?<eos> I ain't never stopped trusting you just like I ain't never stopped loving you.<eos> All right, 4930, sir.<eos> Well, let's get out and see what it looks like.<eos> Hey, Old Moms let's take a walk and see what the back yard looks like.<eos> I'll "Old Moms" you!
You got a free dance for the señorita?<eos> Well, sir, excuse me, but...<eos> But this is our dance, don't you remember?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> - Will you have some?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Hey, that's a good idea.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> - Will you...?
No, my uncle, life is so sad.<eos> That poor thing was going to drown itself.<eos> who's there?<eos> Is she up?<eos> She has been for hours.<eos> I must prepare her things.<eos> Her last day here.<eos> I will not see her again.<eos> Ask her to stay a little longer.<eos> She won't, that ungrateful one.
- Ride with us.<eos> I'll give you the answer.<eos> How wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains...<eos> Look over there.<eos> Well, here we have to leave your luck to learn its business.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why do we come here?<eos> They cannot fight yet.<eos> They must first learn the skill.<eos> And so they will.
People!<eos> People who i can stand.<eos> People like... people like myself.<eos> That's what i'll do. I'll create people, but they'll be like me.<eos> A world full of archibald beechcrofts.<eos> Now, that's a thought.<eos> You bet your life it's a thought.<eos> You bet your sweet life.<eos> That's what i'll do.<eos> I'll will it.
You're too innocent.<eos> She just looks at a man, and right away he starts... scraping sand with both feet.<eos> Look at Tom Healy.<eos> He doesn't know whether he's coming or going.<eos> Thinking she'll marry him.<eos> Why should he marry her when they already go to...<eos> Tut-tut.<eos> He'll never have any peace until he does marry her.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> And neither will she.
From us.<eos> Man... that's a feeling worth dying for!<eos> Have you ever... felt something like that?<eos> Not for a long, long time.<eos> I... envy you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You shouldn't do things like you did.<eos> Go back.<eos> You mustn't take foolish chances.<eos> All right, I won't.
Because I never have found any precious stones.<eos> Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?<eos> That's exactly what I mean.<eos> Aztec treasure.<eos> Would to God we had! I would not be sitting here.<eos> I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.<eos> Then tell me this...how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?<eos> Calvera... We've seen the end of him.<eos> He'll be gone in the morning.<eos> No, he will not.
- Why don't you ask the lady? - I'm asking you!<eos> Can't you see he's hurt and worn out?<eos> Why don't you let him sit down? - Thank you, ma'am, I can stand.<eos> - Sit down there, Sergeant.<eos> Brax, you heard the Lieutenant.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Your wound is open again. Let me see it.<eos> - No, leave me be, miss.<eos> - I will not.<eos> Yes, you will.
Inexhaustible.<eos> Spartacus, there's going to be a fight to the death.<eos> - To the death?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I heard Marcellus tell one of his guards.<eos> - Who fights?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> To the death.<eos> What if they matched you and me?<eos> They won't.
But, faith, I have need for it now.<eos> Tomorrow at dawn I've got to go to Glencove to bring back a bell for the chapel.<eos> I'll have to round up the horse, now, before she runs all over the mountainside.<eos> I'll be glad to give you a hand.<eos> I was just going to ask you to go the rounds of the manor house and try all the doors and the windows.<eos> Right so, but after that, I think I'll go down to the Rathcullen Arms and see about a room.<eos> Now, why would you be doin' that?<eos> I don't like to take hospitality under false pretenses, and besides, two weeks from today, you must leave here.<eos> - I think your daughter should know.<eos> - She will, she will.
- And it...<eos> It's a shame.<eos> - Please.<eos> It's a shame for young George.<eos> First his mother and then this.<eos> He's...<eos> He's gonna...<eos> Gonna figure it's kind of rude of us, Chip.<eos> No.<eos> No, he won't, Sam.
I don't even know who he is.<eos> Then you couldn't have identified him, could you?<eos> I couldn't identify anybody.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Harris.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> I sure hope your luck changes for the better soon.<eos> Goodbye, boys;<eos> I sure hope you find that gold.<eos> We will.
That someday I'd get to live like a lady.<eos> Annie, why didn't you get married?<eos> Oh, I wanted to.<eos> But nobody ever asked me.<eos> Adam, you won't walk out on me now, will you?<eos> Don't you worry, I'm not gonna walk out on you.<eos> Because I wouldn't know what to say at the trial.<eos> Your pa, as good a man as he is, terrifies me with his ways.<eos> I'll speak for you.<eos> You will?
Little Joe, suppose you go fetch her?<eos> She at the house?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I just got back from the lumber camp.<eos> Looks like the feud's started all over again.<eos> Like your Pa says, looks like blood's gonna be running the strip all over again.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Just thought you'd like to know.<eos> Your Pa ain't never going to let you and that Cartwright boy get together.<eos> He will.
-Where was that?<eos> -Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.<eos> -Will you check in later?<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> Here, Driver.<eos> Take this lady back where she belongs.<eos> -Right.<eos> -That ought to cover it.<eos> -Don't forget, call my mother right away.<eos> -I won't.
From day to day.<eos> I want you to drink as much of this Belgian beer as you can.<eos> Unless you want to come out of this gold dust cure with ruined kidneys.<eos> How can I drink so much--<eos> It's all right, there's nobody to see you here except him.<eos> And you know about monkeys.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's good to see you laugh.<eos> You keep laughing, Sister.<eos> I will.
So am I.<eos> No. You are interested in a person, not in life.<eos> But people die or leave us.<eos> I am interested in scientific living things.<eos> I have an experiment to do with the blueness of cheese, which can be important and which will never die.<eos> Do you remember when she set fire to Thomas Earl Parkman Jr. and they had to push him in the fountain to put him out?<eos> She was only 13 then.<eos> She grew up so quickly.<eos> Sometimes I wish she'd set fire to someone again.<eos> She will.
You do have a lovely reading voice, Mrs. Fenimore.<eos> Doesn't she, Uncle Bill?<eos> When she gets a chance to use it.<eos> Shall I read on?<eos> Oh, yes, please do.<eos> I love to listen to you.<eos> Enjoy yourself, then.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> I really don't see...<eos> You will.
I do not trust the magician.<eos> Our only hold over him is this magic lamp and he alone knows the secret of its power.<eos> Let me enter the lamp.<eos> Perhaps I can talk with the genie and learn how to call him.<eos> But is such a thing possible?<eos> Well, who knows what's possible within a magic lamp?<eos> - Please let me try.<eos> - All right.<eos> - If all is not well, you must call quickly.<eos> - I will.
Thank you.<eos> This is fun.<eos> We ought to go for walks more often.<eos> - Those days are over.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> - Your days with the Lombards are over.<eos> - Putting me out of business?<eos> I meant socially.<eos> Anne doesn't like them.<eos> - She will in time.
- What?<eos> - Pain.<eos> This here's Charley Boudre.<eos> He's a friend of Billy's.<eos> This lady takes care of Bill.<eos> - Is he bad off?<eos> - Well, he sleeps a lot.<eos> Could we come in?<eos> - If you don't stay too long.<eos> - Oh, we won't.
No.<eos> A woman will point the way.<eos> - What will she look like?<eos> - You will know her when you see her.<eos> - When will that be?<eos> - Soon enough.<eos> Will she love me or hate me?<eos> Love and hate are horns on the same goat.<eos> What woman would ever look at a slave?<eos> This one will.
He just isn't sure.<eos> It's not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others.<eos> So he gambled for support and I gave it to him.<eos> I respect his motives.<eos> The boy on trial is probably guilty, but... I want to hear more.<eos> The vote is ten to two.<eos> I'm talking!<eos> You have no right to leave this room!<eos> He can't hear you.<eos> He never will.
Yeah.<eos> If I am ever lucky enough to deliver him to the hangman it will be you who helped put him there.<eos> Why didn't you go on your way north?<eos> Why did you jump the boat at Pointe du Loup?<eos> Why did you stay on as Hamish Bond's woman denying freedom to be the mistress of a slave holder?<eos> If you hadn't, much might be different now.<eos> Maybe he'd have a friend somewhere who'd be helping him to live rather than wanting to see him die.<eos> But I guess all the fires of retribution are not in the hereafter.<eos> You've suffered and so has he.<eos> And I always will, with him or without him.
Porter! My boarding ticket.<eos> Here are your chocolates with the nougat inside and those banal movie magazines you're so fond of. Allow me, Madame.<eos> Passengers for London and Paris check through Gate 9 please.<eos> That's you.<eos> Take good care of yourself.<eos> Don't forget your magazines.<eos> Write me if ever you need anything.<eos> I will.<eos> Let me hear from you once in a while. Don't forget.<eos> I won't.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.<eos> - He's very handsome.<eos> - So what?<eos> - Aren't you jealous?<eos> - What?<eos> - Aren't you jealous?<eos> - I haven't got the time for it.<eos> I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.<eos> You'll never pass the entrance exams.<eos> - I will!
The hat.<eos> How about the hat?<eos> - You want it?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Then we'll leave it.<eos> I have no use for it.<eos> You never can tell.<eos> Why not take it on the plane and give it to the stewardess?<eos> I don't know the stewardess.<eos> You will.
It-- it ain't that.<eos> Well, I didn't wanna tell you at the house, but... It was him what done it.<eos> What done what?<eos> What stole all them eggs and bread and meat and stuff.<eos> You mean Old Yeller?<eos> I seen him suck a batch of eggs.<eos> Seen him swipe a pan of grandma's corn bread too.<eos> - But I ain't gonna tell.<eos> - I bet you do.<eos> No, I won't.
Well, ma'am, I guess I better be gettin' back to camp.<eos> Come with me, boy, while I get my horse settled.<eos> Yes, sir. When Mr. Coates gets back, I want you to come and see us.<eos> I want him to meet ya.<eos> That's mighty nice of ya, ma'am.<eos> Good-bye, boy.<eos> Take good care of that Old Yeller dog.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And you take care of my horny toad.<eos> I will.
I think one of us has to start developing a conscience.<eos> At this late date?<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Oh, yes, it is, darling.<eos> I'll tell you about it tonight.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't...<eos> Tonight.<eos> Absolutely... It's always so clear when you explain it, Professor.<eos> Well, perhaps if you were to work on it at home, Miss Powell...<eos> I certainly will.
The charge is cowardice in the face of the enemy.<eos> You have your orders, gentlemen.<eos> Let's carry them out.<eos> But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol... and then blackmailed me into keeping quiet about it!<eos> - That's why he picked me!<eos> - Corporal, I understand your feelings.<eos> But that has nothing to do with the charges you're being tried for.<eos> - Don't you believe me, sir?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> But who else will?
Me, too.<eos> All right, gentlemen. An emergency calls for extraordinary measures.<eos> Suppose we look in on Brother Weems.<eos> Agreed? Agreed!<eos> A walk-up apartment?<eos> Well, if he was a rich man, we wouldn't be here.<eos> What floor, Harry?<eos> Four.<eos> Please, Daddy, try and rest.<eos> Yes, dear, I will.
I'll give you 200.<eos> When my husband says he isn't interested, Mr. Denning, he isn't interested.<eos> You couldn't buy him for a thousand a week, so stop wasting your time.<eos> Will you let me handle this?<eos> There's a lot of good guides in this country.<eos> You won't have any trouble finding one at that price.<eos> Well, perhaps I arrived at an awkward moment.<eos> Think it over, Mr. Cameron.<eos> - If you should change your mind, just-<eos> - I won't.
Man, that's a crazy color.<eos> This is what I've been lookin' for all my life.<eos> I'd sure like to know where your claim is, mister.<eos> - This even feels good!<eos> - I'll take care of it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Don't mind at all. Don't mind to help.<eos> - Just take it easy, pop.<eos> I'd like to have this job by the week.<eos> Maybe you will.
- You defend yourself like a fort.<eos> No matter how I defend myself, you gotta understand I am not in a position to be hauling my fiancée away to a shack somewhere like an alley cat.<eos> I wasn't brought up that way.<eos> You're going to do everything expected of you?<eos> I'm certainly gonna try.<eos> I don't expect you to marry me just because it's expected of you.<eos> Sometimes I look at you and I don't understand you.<eos> I think sometimes I don't even know who you are or what you're all about.<eos> Maybe you don't.<eos> Maybe you never will.

Come on, Charley.<eos> Come on, lie down!<eos> Are you still here?<eos> I did not want to kill him!<eos> I, I still do not want to kill him, but I will.<eos> I have given more opportunities than anyone.<eos> COWBOY HEAD<eos> You can still leave before he comes back to get up.<eos> So I'm going to kill you.<eos> No, you will not.
- Wait, Ksyusha...<eos> - Uncle Panteley!<eos> Why are you so gloomy, Grisha?<eos> It looks like it'll be raining. My back's aching.<eos> He just doesn't want to watch the oxen.<eos> Don't let the oxen spoil the neighbours' grass.<eos> Grisha...<eos> Grishenka...<eos> Your father will hear.<eos> He won't.
You don't go mixing me up with none of them.<eos> I'm just as much of Texas as Bick Benedict is.<eos> - I'm no wetback.<eos> - I know that.<eos> You're very like Jordan in that respect.<eos> Attitude, everything.<eos> But your situation is so different.<eos> You're a working man.<eos> That's something I'm gonna try to fix.<eos> Someday I will.
- Jimmy, where did you get that stogie?<eos> This ain't no stogie, Pop.<eos> It's a Havana panatela.<eos> - 85 cents.<eos> And it's a present.<eos> - Who the sam hill gave it to you?<eos> I the sam hill gave it to me for being a big boy.<eos> - You didn't say where you've been.<eos> - No, and I don't have to.<eos> But I will.
And here you are, askin' me for a ticket to Boot Hill.<eos> Alec, get smart.<eos> Move on with me.<eos> I'm not going anywhere yet.<eos> This is a nice town with nice people.<eos> This bunch of fat bellies?<eos> I happen to like it enough to stick around for a while.<eos> You think they'll forget, what you were?<eos> Why should they?<eos> I won't.
Running onto each other like this.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Man don't ride south in this country unless he got a reason.<eos> - You got a reason, Masters?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> I hear they had themselves a holdup back in Silver.<eos> Yeah, we heard that.<eos> It'll go hard with them that done it, if they catch up to them.<eos> Yeah, it sure will.
No, I got some in the lobby.<eos> What did you do to get Pete to Change his mind?<eos> Beat him up?<eos> No, no muscle.<eos> Not with brains, either.<eos> He's a pushover for a muscleman.<eos> Do you think it runs in the family?<eos> I'd sure like to have seen you tangle with Reno Smith.<eos> He didn't happen to be there when I left.<eos> Maybe I will yet.
You accuse me of being a traitor.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Wouldn't put it past you, you mealy mouthed song singer.<eos> He was right fond of Bill, Clint.<eos> So was I. I tried hard enough to keep him<eos> From pitching in with you.<eos> And you, as long as you live, don't you ever accuse me Of being an informer again.<eos> You got plans, keep 'em to yourself.<eos> I don't want to know about 'em, not even accidentally.<eos> You won't.
We'll split the herd to cross over.<eos> I'll go up and hold this bunch until you put some across.<eos> All right, luis, move 'em out.<eos> - Pedro, let the horses across after we get over.<eos> Clint!<eos> When you're ready, find a good spot and take 'em over!<eos> There's a shorter crossing down below.<eos> Why don't you go that way?<eos> - Why don't you?<eos> - All right, I will.
You led me to believe that I was all that mattered to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But it's not as simple as all that.<eos> I believed what you told me, that's how simple I was.<eos> Get all the men together.<eos> We're moving out.<eos> All right, let's move out.<eos> Take your positions.<eos> What makes you so sure they're going to hit us tonight?<eos> They will.
They are my brothers.<eos> Very clever.<eos> - Well, you already know my position.<eos> - Here, you run out of position.<eos> You have one hour to leave Wichita.<eos> - Help him for luggage.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Tell your brother that I will return.<eos> In your place I will not.
And I intend to stay with you.<eos> Tils is already there and creates a store.<eos> And make a "Kentucky" for all the settlers who are craving for one.<eos> There's only one thing, Jason.<eos> Rifles and women do not mix.<eos> We're moving!<eos> I would not waste time, the wagon would fix, Jason.<eos> Do women join us or not?<eos> Oh, they're coming, son.<eos> They will.
Yes, I know we need it now.<eos> Bills, insurance payments, back rent.<eos> We'll have to struggle through it somehow.<eos> Mr. Willard called today.<eos> If we don't have the rent by Monday, he's going to evict us.<eos> We can't say we weren't expecting it.<eos> That's the trouble if you don't own your own home.<eos> How many times have I said it?<eos> If we just owned our own home...<eos> We will someday, darling.
If I'd never seen it? If Monsieur Duchesne had been in it for several days.<eos> That's quite true.<eos> Tell me exactly how the room was.<eos> It had green damask drapes... rose-patterned wallpaper... an ormolu clock. A sofa in gray, a gray rug, a little oval satinwood table... and a big four-poster bed.<eos> I think that's all I can remember.<eos> Oh, yes, a lamp.<eos> Come along, let's have a look at that room.<eos> They won't let us see it.<eos> They wouldn't let me in last night.<eos> They will today.
But it's a good trick, and it'll work.<eos> On who?<eos> On me.<eos> Because I'm staying with you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm a fool.<eos> Not to me.<eos> What am I to you?<eos> - Maybe it'll help if I tell you.<eos> - It won't.
Don't worry.<eos> - I'll take him up to your loft.<eos> - Okay, I'll see you on the roof.<eos> How goes?<eos> He's up on the roof.<eos> The pigeon?<eos> Yeah, it worked.<eos> I think somebody fell off the roof.<eos> He thought he'd sing to the Crime Commission.<eos> He won't.
Jeff, you holed up out there?<eos> That's right.<eos> That's what I figured.<eos> Waiting to get us as we cross the line?<eos> Yeah, seemed like a good idea.<eos> Still want to take those five jumps?<eos> Have a nice trip!<eos> I'll hang you when you come back!<eos> What makes you think I'm coming?<eos> You will.
Come on, let's get down to the sutler's.<eos> That noise is driving me crazy.<eos> I don't sit around and listen to it all day like you do.<eos> Come on.<eos> I thought I knew every ritual in the Apache book.<eos> This one's got me beat.<eos> It comes close, then it goes away before I can grab it.<eos> When I was with them, young, something I was told or saw or found out.<eos> It's there, but I can't bring it back.<eos> You will.
- l'll take the rest of your report then.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You've come at a bad time, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Carla's a beautiful girl, isn't she?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Times like these, I wish she hadn't come.<eos> I was thinking of sending Alice to visit her.<eos> If we've got an Indian war on our hands, you think the rebs would fight with us?<eos> For their lives, they will.
I might at that.<eos> Jeannie, I have to tell you something.<eos> I heard about Lute, if that's what you mean.<eos> I took over his job as marshal.<eos> Why do you think I came up here?<eos> Oh, but you said once...<eos> I know.<eos> I said I wouldn't marry you because every time you went out into the street I'd be afraid you'd never come back.<eos> The odds haven't improved any.<eos> The odds never will.
You'll relish the life of a crook<eos> There's barrels of fun for everyone<eos> And you'll get treasures by the ton<eos> So come and sign the book<eos> Join up with Captain Hook<eos> Boys!<eos> Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?<eos> But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.<eos> Yeah! He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.<eos> Oh, no, we won't.
That hurts!<eos> I'm sure it's nothing serious.<eos> I'm sick and tired of all this!<eos> I'm gonna have a baby, and I have no clothes, no nothing!<eos> I'm sure things will get better soon.<eos> We can't go on like this.<eos> We have to get married, and I need a job to support us. I don't want to go back!<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> It's getting cold.<eos> No, I won't!
I'm not that young anymore.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I feel we're doing wrong.<eos> I've often talked to Father about this.<eos> Should you have the chance, please get married, anytime you want.<eos> I mean it.<eos> It pains us that you won't remary.<eos> All right.<eos> If I have the chance -<eos> You certainly will.
And now, perhaps you'd better get your arms.<eos> I'd deem it another favor, ma'am, if you'd do what you can for Jones and Harris, my shipmates.<eos> For instance, Harris might be very useful to you for an odd day's work.<eos> He's a fine gunner's mate.<eos> I'll keep them in mind.<eos> And now I suppose it's goodbye, Mr. Hawke.<eos> Keep an open eye while you're sailing with Captain Roc.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> I will, indeed.
Don't shoot!<eos> They were holding me in there!<eos> All right, we go now, out the back window.<eos> Wait.<eos> We gotta scatter their horses, or we won't have a chance.<eos> You won't have a chance of doing that, either.<eos> Come on, get ready.<eos> We'll be gone in a minute.<eos> - I don't want this to end here.<eos> - But it will.
The accounts I have received of Australia... and the next world are not particularly... encouraging, Cousin Cecily.<eos> This world is good enough for me.<eos> Yes, but are you good enough for it?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> That is why I want you to reform me.<eos> You might make that your mission... if you don't mind, Cousin Cecily.<eos> I'm afraid I've no time this afternoon.<eos> Well, would you mind me... reforming myself this afternoon?<eos> It is rather quixotic of you, but I think you should try.<eos> I will.
Mademoiselle Hayem, Monsieur Toulouse-Lautrec.<eos> - Well, Henri, what do you think?<eos> - How do you do, mademoiselle?<eos> We've already met, haven't we, Monsieur Lautrec?<eos> Of course, Henri knows everybody.<eos> Well, Henri, what do you think?<eos> Will it do?<eos> If it looks as well on you, it will do admirably.<eos> Don't talk nonsense.<eos> Of course it will.
"who art all good and deserving of my love.<eos> "But I firmly resolve with the help of Thy Grace, to confess my sins...<eos> "to do penance and to amend my life.<eos> "Amen."<eos> All right, son, go on home.<eos> Don't make a monkey out of me.<eos> If I see you up here again, I'll kick the guts out of you.<eos> Don't make a monkey out of me.<eos> Don't worry, I won't.<eos> He won't.
No, dowries. I mean really not in the story.<eos> They had to work harder and harder every day to get this dowry.<eos> They loved the baby, and she was very well looked after.<eos> She was indeed a lovely child.<eos> And soon she began to help her parents.<eos> Every day, she grew bigger and bigger.<eos> She also had her river... and like the river, her life flowed on and on... until she was a grown-up person.<eos> She was not only beautiful on the outside... but on the inside as well.<eos> Better be careful, Harriet. lf she's as good as all that, you won't be able to find a husband for her.<eos> - Yes, she will.
- Attagirl.<eos> - Yes, massah.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Yes, massah.<eos> Come on, Julie.<eos> Come on, come on, you kept us waiting for you.<eos> - Mr. Green, can we do our number now? - Yeah?<eos> - A little later.<eos> - We hope you like it.<eos> - I will. Yeah?
I lost my morals, did I? Automatically, by going to work and staying inside the system?<eos> You're taking me a little personally.<eos> I was talking about myself.<eos> I was saying that I got a little squeamish, you know?<eos> I know people that work a lot crasser jobs than you, and they're happy. They're happy, they're healthy, they're not depressed. They enjoy the material blessings.<eos> Confucius say "Of the 39 steps of escape the best one's flight." So I fled.<eos> Here I am in France where I can pull down my pants.<eos> I'm enough of a retarded romantic to believe France is still a place to go and think.<eos> So I'll stay, I guess...<eos> or I won't.
Where did you get that dress?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> It's just a little old thing Jared rummaged for me in a chest.<eos> Jared, eh?<eos> So he rummaged it for you in a chest, did he?<eos> Well, take it off.<eos> Oh, were you taking it to someone?<eos> How awful of Jared not to tell me.<eos> But, after all, she won't know, will she?<eos> I will.
You got a mortgage due on your place in five weeks.<eos> You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you?<eos> Tiny will talk to you in the morning.<eos> Get going.<eos> You haven't answered my question.<eos> Why are you saving Pillsbury?<eos> Not Pillsbury.<eos> It's something much more important than that.<eos> If McMurphy gets away with this, no telling where he'll stop.<eos> Or where you will.
If they'd said sunshine, I would've worn my raincoat.<eos> Oh, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I think we can straighten up now.<eos> Raining, huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I wish it'd stop.<eos> I've got an appointment.<eos> Nobody would expect you to be on time in this weather.<eos> He will.
Quite a turnout down below.<eos> Old Palmer's music had better be good.<eos> Boronskaja would hardly be dancing the leading role if it wasn't.<eos> Boro who?<eos> Who exactly is Boronskaja?<eos> Since you've stood in a queue for six hours... waiting to see her dance, I should have thought-<eos> Not to see anybody. To hear.<eos> Have you ever heard of Professor Palmer? - Never.<eos> - Never.<eos> You will.
I think it's wonderful.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - Your bags will be right up.<eos> The light switch is here, if my memory doesn't fail me.<eos> Okay, Langford.<eos> I'll do it anyway.<eos> I'll get an annulment!<eos> - There's no annulment in Argentina.<eos> - I'll get it anyway!<eos> I will!
I just want to ask you a very few simple questions.<eos> Nothing really difficult or involved.<eos> Just some little things.<eos> And I'm sure you'll all want to help.<eos> Mr. Draque, do you like it?<eos> A genuine Berton, Mrs. Draque.<eos> By the way, how's your head?<eos> That mean anything to you, Willoughby?<eos> - To me, no.<eos> - It will.
Wait a minute, please. You didn't give me a chance.<eos> - Donald explained and...<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> It was all a mistake, and you're sorry.<eos> But my pal and I got plans for the night.<eos> - We'd like to get going.<eos> - I haven't got a thing to do.<eos> Well, I thought, if you didn't mind, that you could come back for a while.<eos> It's Donald, he's so upset and it's way past his bedtime.<eos> Well, sure we will.
Goodbye.<eos> Joe?<eos> Joe?<eos> What would you like most for a present?<eos> Well, don't tell Aunt Susie I told you, now, because it's a secret and she said that you and Clarence fixed it up with a man for her to get a new job and make lots of money.<eos> So she's gonna buy us all the most wonderful presents in the world.<eos> Joe, what would you rather have than anything?<eos> Well, I'll sort of think it over and let you know.<eos> Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you, now.<eos> No, no, I won't.
- This is for Cooley when he comes in.<eos> - I'll tell him.<eos> At 4:45?<eos> Thank you. Goodbye.<eos> There's a train leaving in an hour. We can make connections for Gabriel Valley.<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> I can't go on endangering you.<eos> - I know about last night.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> But it will.
Will you get out of here?<eos> I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.<eos> It's his bugle blowing.<eos> The police want to throw him into a state institution.<eos> How do you like that?<eos> - I read an ad here about a room to rent.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> If you sign the papers and Teddy commits himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.<eos> It's a wonderful place.<eos> You will? Fine!
Hurry, he's bleeding all over the place.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> - Yeah, Matrac.<eos> He got two Messerschmitts.<eos> He didn't get the third one.<eos> It was for his kid's birthday.<eos> We couldn't make it.<eos> My comrades, I can think of no more fitting last words for our friend than those which he himself wrote as his last words and wasn't able to deliver.<eos> "My dear son, "today you are 5 years old, and your father has never seen you.<eos> "But someday, in a better world, he will.
I want you to take these.<eos> They were my grandmother's, and her mother's before that.<eos> She gave them to me when I got married.<eos> They're all I've got left.<eos> I want you to take them out of here and save them till we can...<eos> Suppose they get me before I get out?<eos> Then throw them overboard, at least they won't have them.<eos> Suppose you never come for them?<eos> Then let it be a part payment for all you've done for us.<eos> Please, won't you?
There are three or four things he's considering... but he hasn't quite said yes or no to any of them yet.<eos> Really?<eos> He better say no and say it quickly.<eos> I need a fellow up at my kennels.<eos> I think, Carraclough, that you're the very fellow for the job.<eos> I, sir?<eos> I, to get paid for working with dogs?<eos> - Will you take the job?<eos> - You see, I...<eos> Of course he will, sir.
- Neither have I.<eos> I thought for a minute, but I was mistaken.<eos> This is no dog of mine.<eos> Upon my soul and honor, this dog never belonged to me.<eos> Come along, child. We've got to be going.<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> That dog looks to me as if she needs a lot of care.<eos> She does that, sir.<eos> She'll get all the care she needs up at my kennels.<eos> - Indeed she will, sir.
It's all mixed up, but I know I shot her twice.<eos> Harry, am I insane?<eos> Could I have shot through Alucard and killed her without hurting him?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Well, I shot right through him.<eos> I shot right through him!<eos> Kay screamed and fell, and he just stood there.<eos> Just stood there, staring at me.<eos> You don't believe that, do you?<eos> Nobody will.
Here they are.<eos> You better wait in my office.<eos> Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.<eos> Haven't you told him? - Not yet.<eos> - But you were able to arrange everything?<eos> Everything is quite all right.<eos> We'll tell him at the airport.<eos> The less time to think, the easier.<eos> Please trust me.<eos> Yes, I will.
Guns.<eos> Funny how the sound carries with this east wind.<eos> Mr. Miniver's not back from Dunkirk, I suppose?<eos> No, he's not back.<eos> Neither is my son.<eos> They've been gone five days now.<eos> - Oh, they'll be back, ma'am. You'll see.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll be very glad to see.<eos> - You will.
Thank you.<eos> I hate goodbyes.<eos> They don't matter.<eos> - It's what's gone before.<eos> - No, it's what can't go after.<eos> We may see each other sometime.<eos> No, we promised.<eos> We are both to go home.<eos> Will it help you to know I'll miss you every moment?<eos> So will I, Jerry.

Not Dr. Browns nor Dr. Jaquith.<eos> I won't tell a single living soul.<eos> I'd soon as die than put you in the wrong.<eos> Tina, really?<eos> You called me Tina.<eos> Did I?<eos> How stupid of me.<eos> But then it is a nickname for Christine?<eos> But nobody calls me that, except my daddy.<eos> I won't, then.
All the arguing in the world can't change the decision of the umpire.<eos> How much time have I got?<eos> - Mrs. Gehrig is waiting.<eos> Have her come up, please.<eos> I don't want Mrs. Gehrig to know, ever.<eos> I understand.<eos> - But the newspapers...<eos> - Sam here can take care of that.<eos> - Can't you, Sam? - Sure.<eos> I will.
-ls he suffering very much?<eos> -Yes, he had to break his silence.<eos> -He couldn't bear it any longer?<eos> -No, he couldn't.<eos> -Poor little thing.<eos> -He's just a mere boy.<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> -What's he want you to do, adopt him?<eos> He's dying to see me, even if it's just for a minute.<eos> Of course I won't.
I suppose I should put the coin in my shoe.<eos> You'll be the next bride in the family, Maria.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Not me.<eos> - Oh, but you have to be.<eos> Papa made it very clear that we can't get married until after you do.<eos> He says it's our family tradition that the girls be disposed of one, two, three, four.<eos> And you'll be the oldest now.<eos> Papa will get over that silly tradition.<eos> No, he won't.
What about me?<eos> He said my name would be dragged through the mud.<eos> That everywhere I went...<eos> There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.<eos> I'd say that it'd been made for you.<eos> You can't tell me the voters of this state...<eos> I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.<eos> I am interested in our son.<eos> - Charlie, if they publish this story...<eos> - They won't.
Stop at the cigar store on your way out, and get me a couple of good cigars.<eos> - Be glad to.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> One is enough.<eos> When I was a young man, there was an impression that nurses were pretty.<eos> Well, it was no truer then than it is today.<eos> - I'll take your arm.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You won't forget about those cigars?<eos> - I won't.
Well, I'll be....<eos> Why, sure.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I won't stop you.<eos> -Turn right and go up the hill, driver.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Mr. Spade!<eos> Do you bring me any news?<eos> Did you manage it so the police won't have to know about me?<eos> They won't for a while, anyway.
I ain't so much interested in my health, either.<eos> Round them up, boys!<eos> Men, the reason I asked you to meet here in secret like this is... we've got to take some steps to protect ourselves.<eos> I'm fed up on the whole thing.<eos> It ain't worth it.<eos> The trouble with us is, we're not organized like the rustlers are.<eos> Look at Townsend.<eos> They slaughtered his cattle and burnt him out.<eos> - I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> - It won't.
Listen, Jack. I wanta give you some of the best advice you've ever had.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let Western Union alone.<eos> I not gonna let them alone until they have paid 10 times over every foot of wire they're stringing.<eos> Why this is better than owning a gold mine.<eos> Steal the cattle, steal the horses, burn them out.<eos> Then when they need more wagons, more horses, and more cattle, will be on hand to sell it to em.<eos> You're a fool Jack.<eos> You can't go against a thing as big as this without getting hung.<eos> Maybe I will and maybe I won't.
- Its going to be easy. Forget it for now.<eos> - No, Imm serious.<eos> Theyre bound to let him win.<eos> Even Ive read that crooked gamblers let you win at first as a come on.<eos> Youre reading the wrong books, baby.<eos> To find out what happens to nice guys, dont read books, just read the headlines.<eos> What happened to the Poles, the Finns and the Dutch?<eos> They were nice little guys.<eos> Did they win?<eos> - They will sometime.
We'll get that out when we get back to the ship.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How did the Spanish know we were here?<eos> That's what I can't fathom.<eos> We'll find out someday.<eos> Wonder if the others got through, Captain?<eos> If they did, they'll head for the ship.<eos> Lads, we'd best be moving.<eos> You'll never get there with me, Captain.<eos> Of course we will, William.
I am no longer a man.<eos> I am a bird!<eos> I'm the king of birds!<eos> No! Oh.<eos> Mmm, I want it!<eos> I want it.<eos> I must have it, and I'll give you anything you wish for it.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I ask but one thing in return.<eos> Anything you will.
- I think it's funny!<eos> - Get in, girl.<eos> - Yeah, you laugh now, but in the end it's Luís who will laugh.<eos> Yes, Luís, the widow's son, what do you think?<eos> He's already interested in your father's lands!<eos> My father's lands?<eos> My father's lands will be mine!<eos> That'll be the day!<eos> - It won't start.<eos> - It won't?
- Joe!<eos> Joe! - Yes, sir?<eos> Pack my bag. Send a message round to Dr. Sutton's house to send his bag round here.<eos> We're going to General Burroughs's. The 8:15 from Paddington.<eos> Oh, but I've got an important appointment in the morning, John.<eos> - And, Joe!<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> Tell Dr. Sutton's man to cancel all his appointments for tomorrow.<eos> Oh, but Ethne and the general will know before we get there.<eos> They won't.
Only $25 to give your...<eos> - One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.<eos> - For what lady, sir?<eos> For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<eos> - For whom, sir?<eos> - Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<eos> Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning. But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to...<eos> Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<eos> She will not consider it, sir.<eos> Oh, yes, I will!
- It's my duty to our... brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty.<eos> It's so long since I had anything new!<eos> How do I look?<eos> Awful!<eos> Just awful!<eos> Why? What's the matter?<eos> This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.<eos> Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.<eos> But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it!<eos> You will, though.
No hard feelings, son.<eos> Why, no, sir.<eos> Tryin' to hold us up?<eos> - Tryin' to jack up the price, are you?<eos> - Leave him alone!<eos> No, no, please!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Don't hurt him!<eos> - I'll sign.<eos> I will, right now.
Tryin' to hold us up?<eos> - Tryin' to jack up the price, are you?<eos> - Leave him alone!<eos> No, no, please!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Don't hurt him!<eos> - I'll sign.<eos> I will, right now.<eos> - Don't sign it, Ma.<eos> I will.
Those men...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Forget it.<eos> That bunch is out for blood...<eos> I said:<eos> Forget about them.<eos> Horace Miller goes to the Senate.<eos> - I won't send Horace Miller.<eos> - Oh, you won't?<eos> No, I won't.
She's got a witch's brain.<eos> I love her.<eos> I hate her.<eos> I adore her.<eos> That side of it you must know for yourself.<eos> But, my lord, permit me to caution you.<eos> Don't count too much on the loves of queens.<eos> Thanks, Schoolmaster Bacon, for that sound lecture and the sound advice.<eos> Which you probably will not take.<eos> Which I probably will not.
And really feel the part<eos> I could stay young and chipper And Id lock it with a zipper<eos> If I Only Had a Heart<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Im a little rusty yet.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> That was wonderful!<eos> You know we were wondering why you couldnt come with us to ask the Wizard for a heart.<eos> Suppose the Wizard wouldnt give me one when we got there.<eos> Oh, but he will!
Just until I can get it through to her that....<eos> It was what she asked and after all, a couple of years isn't a lifetime.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - I think everything will be all right, Johnny.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I can see the way they feel about it.<eos> I could hardly expect them to do a complete, sudden about-face but....<eos> But, hang it, why can't they see what I'm getting at?<eos> Perhaps eventually they will.
If I can, you can.<eos> - Where are you off to?<eos> - Will you come?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - On a trip. On a big ride.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Will you come, Ned?<eos> - Listen, Father--<eos> - A trip now is out of the question.<eos> - You won't.
You tell her I'm in the middle of something important.<eos> Directors' meeting.<eos> I can't leave now.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.<eos> She'll understand, all right.<eos> But liking it is gonna be different.<eos> And expecting a man to go to a dressmaker's with you.<eos> I declare, I hope Pres doesn't come.<eos> - He will.
Geoffrey's coming here.<eos> Elsa, there's something I must know. -You do love me, don't you? -Oh, Perry.<eos> I know we both try to be loyal to Geoffrey by hiding our real feelings but now he's coming back and we can't go on pretending.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> Oh, Perry, I've tried so hard not to, but I do love you.<eos> -I knew it. -But I'm still engaged to him.<eos> We must tell him when he gets here.<eos> I must tell him, it's my responsibility.<eos> When he knows how we feel, he won't stand in our way. -Suppose he doesn't understand?<eos> -He will.
What happened?<eos> They think there's a force coming to support us.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, Sir. Thank heaven I missed you.<eos> Yeah, lucky for me, you were aiming at me.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> I'm more than pleased with the brilliant success of your expedition.<eos> Congratulations, Major Vickers.<eos> Why, thank you, Sir.<eos> -I haven't seen it in notice yet.<eos> -You will tomorrow.
Why, they must've been married a long time.<eos> Nearly 30 years.<eos> And they loved each other all that time?<eos> Yes.<eos> You sound as though you didn't believe it.<eos> It's hard to believe that there's such happiness in this world.<eos> Marguerite now you've put tears on my hand.<eos> Why?<eos> You will never love me 30 years.<eos> No one will.
Shall we go inside?<eos> We might go to the top of the hill.<eos> - Look at the baron's chateau?<eos> - No.<eos> Are you going to spoil a day like this by being jealous?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Only I always know he's there.<eos> But I'm always here.<eos> Don't ever leave me.<eos> I never will.
My name is Willoughby.<eos> I'm a special emissary of His Majesty the King.<eos> Lord Willoughby?<eos> - You were informed, I think, of my coming.<eos> - Yes. Yet you went off on some wild goose chase after a pirate... leaving your capital at the mercy of the enemy.<eos> Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter, as you may well find.<eos> Seeing that you hold your office from James... it's even possible the charge of treason lies against you.<eos> But, my lord...<eos> I'm not concerned to hear your reasons, man.<eos> - His Excellency the Governor will.
Go on, see if I care.<eos> It's a dirty trick, bringing me to New York, just to make a widow of me.<eos> - You wouldn't be a widow long.<eos> - You bet I wouldn't.<eos> - Not with all your money.<eos> - Fool.<eos> Well, any port in a storm.<eos> Goodbye, sugar.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Sure I will.
- Yes.<eos> - Have you a nice evening gown?<eos> - What's that got to do with it?<eos> Have you got a nice evening gown?<eos> Yes, I've got a lulu.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm going to give a party and invite all the suspects.<eos> The suspects?<eos> They won't come.<eos> Yes, they will.
Sure, lots of times.<eos> I gotta be getting back to the mission.<eos> Sally's father is waiting for me.<eos> That ought to be interesting.<eos> Yeah, but it's one of the things I have to do.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Come up again.<eos> Any time.<eos> Thanks, I will.
But I wasn't here, Mr Dickson, honest.<eos> - Then where were you?<eos> - Wait.<eos> You realise you're being charged with murder. It's serious, son.<eos> Come on, I know you didn't do it, but you got to make them believe it.<eos> Come on, tell me the truth.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Listen, if I get them out of the room, will you tell me?<eos> No, I won't.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Stenographer.<eos> Please.<eos> Her master's voice.<eos> Goodbye, Mr. Kringelein.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye, funny one.<eos> Don't forget tomorrow. 5:00.<eos> - I won't. Goodbye, you.
I most certainly am.<eos> I'll be with you in just one moment.<eos> - This is to be a great day for Osage.<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Not more than two.<eos> Well, maybe three fingers.<eos> Dixie Lee sentenced to...<eos> When did all this happen?<eos> It didn't yet, but it will at 2:00 this afternoon.<eos> - What will?
You'll only make a noise<eos> Watch, girls!<eos> One, two...<eos> Girls! Listen to this<eos> "Dear Parents, today is another horrid Sunday<eos> "Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?<eos> "Please, send me something to eat<eos> "Your loving daughter, Ilse"<eos> If the Headmistress got hold of that!<eos> But she won't.
It seems to me you're forcing yourself on this lady.<eos> Is that how it seems to you?<eos> How else can I take it?<eos> It's nothing to me how you take it.<eos> But it matters a heap to me, ma'am, how you understand.<eos> Perhaps not. But if it concerns Miss Cameron,<eos> I'll demand an explanation.<eos> You will?<eos> Then speak your piece.<eos> Mr. Thorpe, will...
As you were saying ... rather unfortunate the way that poor man round the corner... uh... died last night.<eos> On the other hand, perhaps it's fortunate. For us, that is... that a suspicious looking man, with a criminal record, was seen hanging around the place.<eos> - You....<eos> Look here, don't you try and swing this thing on me.<eos> - Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland Yard, are at present looking for that man.<eos> - I say, Frank!<eos> - But there's one thing you seem to have forgotten....<eos> - Before we get to any hanging, I shall have quite a lot to say.<eos> And the first thing I shall say is, that she was there too.<eos> - Oh, you will, will you?
- So I guess there's a plan now?<eos> - Could be.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - He's letting me off.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just keep circling. You'll be fine.<eos> - Sit tight. I'm getting off for a minute.<eos> - Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> - It'll be OK. - Are you just gonna leave us here?<eos> - I would.
Either way, I can't do a thing.<eos> This planet is about to blow up.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Arrest it?<eos> I never should've let her go.<eos> I shouldn't have waited to call.<eos> Then why did you?<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid she'd hang up on me.<eos> Afraid she wouldn't.
They're healthy, beautiful, lovable...<eos> Flammable.<eos> Maybe I'm more ready for parenthood than I thought.<eos> - Hey, what are you guys doing here? - Arleen!<eos> And this must be...<eos> Yes, little Nathan.<eos> I'm so glad I ran into you.<eos> We both want to thank you guys again.<eos> Would one of you like to hold him?<eos> Yes, I would.
The Chivers were engaged for a year and a half.<eos> Larry Lefferts and Gertrude were engaged for two.<eos> I'm sure Mama expects something customary.<eos> Your parents have always let you have your way.<eos> You're almost 22.<eos> Tell your mother what you want.<eos> I couldn't refuse her the last thing she'd ever ask of me as a little girl.<eos> Can't we just strike out for ourselves?<eos> Shall we elope?<eos> Well, if you would, why not?
I... I think she means are you gonna go see "The Chink"?<eos> Well, I may, and I may not.<eos> But seeing him's not my main objective here.<eos> You know, th-that's good 'cause, you know, he... he might not see you.<eos> I mean, we drove all the way from Minneapolis and the crazy bastard tried to stone us to death.<eos> Yeah, it bummed me out.<eos> I thought he was a master, but he's nothing but a dirty old mountain man.<eos> He took out his wanker and shook it at Barbara.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't go up there if I were you.<eos> I wouldn't, okay?
Because, I mean...<eos> ... you'rebehindadesknow.<eos> Not much chance of getting wounded there.<eos> Look, captain, it has nothing to do with that.<eos> I'll make my speech.<eos> They make me do this, you understand.<eos> I hate to lose a good cop.<eos> Not too late to change your mind.<eos> Lot of good cops want to drop the whole kit and caboodle.<eos> And who wouldn't?
That's why I came down.<eos> - Spit it out!<eos> - Don't shout at me!<eos> I'm not!<eos> Bust my tuchus to get here on New Year's Eve or on Christmas, or whatever the...<eos> Looks like Chuck's a tomcat on the prowl.<eos> My pinched sciatica would make your lumbago look like eyestrain.<eos> Is it?<eos> Does he?<eos> Would he?
I mean, don't you have a conscience?<eos> Everybody gets cancellations.<eos> - Not everybody.<eos> - Oh, come on, please!<eos> Think of your guilt.<eos> - Look at your schedule. - Think about your guilt.<eos> All right.<eos> Maybe I can hold off... until each one of you is actually needed.<eos> Would you?<eos> You would.
Patrols.<eos> You really get off on this shit, don't you?<eos> It's just a job. I don't think about it much.<eos> So that's the secret: not thinking.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This assignment was supposed to be a piece of cake.<eos> You're in, you're out. You go back home. You reap the rewards.<eos> Washington brass loves this shit.<eos> They never said anything about a goddamn jungle creep, that's for sure.<eos> Yeah, well. Those guys wouldn't.
Another level of restraint just broke away.<eos> Hey, are you listening to what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, but I'd rather not.<eos> Oh, but I insist.<eos> Here's the crucial part.<eos> Even as they ignore their own responsibility in this mess... the government is now blaming the police for exacerbating the situation.<eos> Seems they don't think the police can be trusted.<eos> In other words, they'll change the actors, but keep the script the same.<eos> They wouldn't dare....<eos> Yes, they would.
- The Masnada, Hastings, is a very secret, ancient confederation of gangs spread across the world from Naples, where it started.<eos> - Like this mafia whatnot I read about? - No.<eos> It is older than the mafia.<eos> - So what's the connection between the Masnada and Foscatini?<eos> - I do not know, mon ami.<eos> Perhaps they came into possession of these papers which we are told so embarrassed the Italian government, and Asciano was the man deputed to sell them back, just as the government deputed this so-called Foscatini to buy them.<eos> - The embassy said they'd never heard of him.<eos> - What else would they say?<eos> - I didn't think you'd have anything to do with me if you thought I was a servant.<eos> - Oh... - Well, would you?
What is that on your lip?<eos> - What?<eos> - It's like a discoloration.<eos> It's white.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it's white.<eos> - Why is that white?<eos> - You'd better get that checked out.<eos> - "Better get that checked out"?<eos> - I would.
He doesn't understand the issues.<eos> Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major.<eos> - I'll stay in touch with the situation.<eos> The Cardassian warship has docked.<eos> All procedural details are being observed, no matter how long it takes.<eos> Well done.<eos> I have research to do on the Kohn-Ma before I see them.<eos> I don't know much about the Bajoran terrorists, but you've never fought the Cardassians.<eos> You wouldn't want to turn any man over to their tender care, sir.<eos> You just wouldn't.
I wanted to help Solomon, but I was afraid she'd send me away, too.<eos> I hate her.<eos> I bet your mommy wasn't mean like mine.<eos> I didn't have a mommy.<eos> She died when I was very little.<eos> Your mommy died?<eos> Then who took care of you?<eos> I had to take care of myself.<eos> Peyton, if something happens to my mommy, would you take care of me?<eos> Of course I would.
(Ramon) Manuel, he thought big.<eos> I made big.<eos> He didn't sell vacations, he booked expeditions.<eos> We are interested in the business expeditions from Bogota to New York.<eos> I loved Colombia and so did Manuel.<eos> We watched our country die for 20 years, destroyed by drug trade.<eos> A lot of profit came out of that destruction, my friend.<eos> What happened in Colombia embarrassed Manuel.<eos> He said that, if he... if he thought it would make a difference, he would go back there and run for office.<eos> But it wouldn't.
Although one step is not all that sunken.<eos> - Who gave you my address?<eos> - No, that's a fair question. It is.<eos> Jerry. Yeah.<eos> Jerry's a friend of mine.<eos> He gave it to me.<eos> Unbelievable how many addresses this guy has.<eos> He's got Marlon Brando's.<eos> I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.<eos> Of course, I wouldn't.
I think that mines on Ligos VII can be very hazardous.<eos> Now, how many people on your ship?<eos> 1014.<eos> Very hazardous, Commander.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm the classroom computer. What can I do for you today?<eos> Computer, display interior security grid.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't do that.<eos> - Would you like to play a game?<eos> - No, I would not.
- Hey, it's only a rough draft.<eos> - Women buy these products, Dan. - I think I'm aware of that.<eos> No, that's a man's concept of what appeals to a woman.<eos> Well, all the women I showed it to thought it looked terrific.<eos> What women?<eos> Your secretary?<eos> The ladies in accounting?<eos> What are they gonna say to Mr. California-suntan-vice-president?<eos> - Arnold thought it looked great.<eos> - Oh, Arnold would.
Less, less repulsive than<eos> You mean like a dead animal lying on the side of the road squirming with maggots?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Visualize.<eos> Visualize! Yeah!<eos> I think that can work.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> Wish I'd had those smarts when I was doing the county fair circuit with my hog Maribelle. Rule number one:<eos> You gotta go to the right parties. You gotta sell out.<eos> I wouldn't.
Five minutes, that's all. I just wanna find him.<eos> - I can't do it. - But why?<eos> Why can't you do it?<eos> I can't.<eos> That's not a reason, "You can't." You just don't want to.<eos> That's right.<eos> But why? Why don't you want to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
How long you been in love with her?<eos> Harry, who said anything about love?<eos> Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.<eos> I did?<eos> So, what did the second penguin say?<eos> Well, the first penguin said to the second penguin: "You look like you're wearing a tuxedo."<eos> And the second penguin said, "Maybe I am."<eos> The defense rests.<eos> Do you want some more pie? A whole pie?<eos> Yes, I would, Miss Johnson, and a piece of paper and a pencil.
Well, it so happens that tall people such as myself, can handle...<eos> Liquor.<eos> I saw this shit in The Exorcist.<eos> Stanley.<eos> Oh, hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> I tried to call you but you have no phone.<eos> Oh, I don't need one.<eos> Who'd want to call me?<eos> I would.
I earned at least $50.<eos> Yeah, well, i don't see you giving me any of the stuff he gave you.<eos> I am perfectly willing to give you half of everything eddie left me.<eos> That'd be half of his debts and half of his funeral and headstone bills, which should work out to somewhere in the neighborhood of, uh, $620.<eos> Here's the $50.<eos> Keep the coat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's nice doing business with you.<eos> Well, i know you'd give me my half of whatever eddie left you.<eos> I would.
You were paid off, Mr. Poirot, you were paid off handsomly.<eos> And now look. I have police officers crawling all over the house!<eos> You are not too popular in Clapham this morning, Poirot.<eos> A bit of a wild goose chase, Poirot.<eos> As far as we can ascertain, this mr. Simpson of yours is a perfectly respectable young bank employee who happens to have gone home to his family.<eos> We have the Shopshire Constable checking it at the moment.<eos> - I only it wanted to ask...<eos> - No!<eos> - Perhaps you'd be interested to know what...<eos> - No I wouldn't!
Oh, right, yes, right.<eos> Um, yes. I'd like to call my first witness,<eos> Captain Darling.<eos> You wish to call the counsel for the prosecution as a defence witness?<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't worry, sir, I've got it all under control.<eos> Ahem. You are Captain Darling of the general staff?<eos> I am.<eos> Captain, leaving aside the incident in question, would you think of Captain Blackadder as the sort of man who would usually ignore orders?<eos> Yes, I would.
Do they have regular checker games in salons, Peg?<eos> Do they run the numbers in salons, Peg?<eos> Will they laugh in a salon when you say...<eos> "What do women and dog doody have in common?<eos> The older they get, the easier they are to pick up."<eos> Would they, Peg?<eos> Probably not, Al.<eos> Then I'm not going, and I'll tell you something else.<eos> I need a place that'll cut my nose hair.<eos> Tony would.
Howlin' Chick Howell... on, um,<eos> (music) [Rock And Roll] Couldn't think of anything snappy to say. Sometimes happens.<eos> Man, you've really got it bad.<eos> Now, now, Fred.<eos> I appreciate your opinion, but no matter how many editorials you publish, I am not gonna stop playing rock and roll.<eos> I'm not asking you to change everything you do, Rachel. Just don't play those records.<eos> You talk about rock and roll like it's some kind of contagious disease, like... like...<eos> Chicken pox?<eos> No, I think it's just inappropriate.<eos> And so would your father.
At least that's the rumor.<eos> Yeah, but people hire droppers.<eos> It wasn't Allison.<eos> But whoever it was is probably here in Nick's book.<eos> So, if you could just find me...<eos> "Dead Men Don't Die".<eos> Uh, I doubt that it was published under that title.<eos> Check under Nick Allen.<eos> Maybe he used a nom de plume.<eos> I would.
- And in the meantime, I'm a hologram?<eos> - It's only for a couple of weeks.<eos> You're talking like it's a pair of hedge trimmers or somethin'.<eos> I'd return it intact.<eos> More than intact, it'd be fitter.<eos> Rimmer, you're not having my body.<eos> Why are you worried?<eos> How can I treat it any worse?<eos> You admit you don't look after it properly.<eos> I would.
Could you take me back to that house?<eos> I don't think that's wise, Denis.<eos> You told me that house is safe now.<eos> The furniture's gone?<eos> I sold it off.<eos> All of it?<eos> Whatever in sell went to the junk yard.<eos> There was a ... a standing lamp in this room.<eos> Would anyone have a record?<eos> I would.
Got a deal?<eos> I guess we got a deal.<eos> You sure this is the place?<eos> That's the place, all right.<eos> Just like he wrote me.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - Two Old Styles on draft.<eos> Draft, hell.<eos> I want a bottle.<eos> You would.
I hope he is acquitted.<eos> Are you still friendly with him?<eos> No.<eos> But I know what it's like in jail.<eos> Mr Burge?<eos> You know that before you came on the scene,<eos> Lord Astor, an old friend of the accused, had lent him substantial sums of money?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Are you aware that Lord Astor denies any impropriety in his acquaintanceship with you?<eos> Well, he would, wouldn't he?
Just think of me as somebody who doesn't like you very much.<eos> The surprise party is out.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's the guy I followed to the setup.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Tarty Tango.<eos> You're a pretty boy, aren't you?<eos> I'm panicking.<eos> How would you like me to change it for you?<eos> - I wouldn't. - How about you?
Jack Dalton, Mercenary Management and Equipment.<eos> My associate, Mr. MacGyver.<eos> we're just buzzing the hot spots in Central America trying to whip up a little business.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> Yifta, your weapons dealer.<eos> He's got kind of a loose mouth, see, and, well, competition being what it is...<eos> Look.<eos> we thought you might be interested in some heavy duty hardware...<eos> Maybe they'd like to see a sample of our latest product.<eos> Of course they would.
But there can be no man living who fears death less than I do now.<eos> What where your plans?<eos> I was intending to bury myself in Central Africa.<eos> My work there is but half done.<eos> Go and do the other half.<eos> I, for one, am not prepared to stop you.<eos> God bless you, both of you.<eos> Not for the first time, Holmes, you presume to take the law into your hands.<eos> I have never loved but if I did and if the woman I had loved had met with such an end I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.<eos> Wouldn't you?
I heard. I'm sorry.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Why do you say it like that?<eos> Because... I know you never really approved of me.<eos> Why, I hardly know you.<eos> It's not from my lack of trying.<eos> Oh, look, I know this must all be very upsetting to you. But, you know...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you needed money, how come Paul didn't ask me?<eos> Well... he wouldn't.
Janet, we haven't discussed my fee yet.<eos> It will be $50,000.<eos> Yes, I'll have to call my father.<eos> I wish I could make it lower, but the clinic would never allow that.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> - Let me show you the rest of the villa.<eos> - What about Freddy?<eos> - Freddy, go to your room.<eos> I'd like to come upstairs, too.<eos> Of course you would.
These are typical brain scans from our subjects.<eos> It's very focused.<eos> It targets only certain areas of the brain.<eos> Air and vital functions:<eos> Breathing, heart rate.<eos> Looks like somebody turned it off with a switch.<eos> But in the areas controlling sensory awareness, thoughts and emotions bang.<eos> So the animals know what's happening to them?<eos> Yeah, the entire time.<eos> A man would, too.
Course he has.<eos> "Forewarned is forearmed..."<eos> "to the unending task of conquering the forces of evil, wherever they might appear."<eos> I said to the man: "This is supposed to retract"... but it didn't.<eos> So you see, I almost stabbed him right through the heart.<eos> My dear girl, the very best story is the one Charlie's already told you.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> The things that we saw.<eos> You wouldn't believe half of it.<eos> - No I probably wouldn't, Mr. Vincent.
Yes, I know, I have to make a decision, but there are times when you can't do it on your own.<eos> - Sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about.<eos> Well Sir... I think this time, you'll have to decide on your own.<eos> We have to get those documents immediately.<eos> - We're ready.<eos> - Yes, but don't...<eos> You know what I mean...<eos> That's not up to us.<eos> The Abbot knows everything.<eos> But you wouldn't...
Mom, Do you think i'm pretty ?<eos> Well, of course you are.<eos> You are a beautiful young girl.<eos> You have to say that. You're my mother.<eos> Dad, if you were my age, would you ask me out ?<eos> If i were your age, And you weren't my daughter,<eos> And if i weren't married ...<eos> See, dad won't even ask me out.<eos> Willie ...<eos> Of course i would.
Eh? - Do you speak English?<eos> - A little...<eos> What exactly do you mean?<eos> Can we talk or are we going to spend the rest of the afternoon asking each other the way to the beach in very loud voices?<eos> Ah, no.<eos> I can order coffee, deal with waiters, make sexy chit-chat with girls, that type of thing.<eos> Just don't ask me to take a physiology class or direct a light opera.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Now, listen, Frou-Frou, would you like to earn some money?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
In the middle of Dover harbour, we were struck by a tidal wave.<eos> I was forced to swim to Boulogne with the unconscious Baldrick tucked into my trousers.<eos> Then, we were taken to Paris, where I was summarily tried and condemned to death, and then hung by the larger of my testicles from the walls of the Bastille.<eos> It was then that I decided I had had enough.<eos> Bravo!<eos> I rescued the Count, killed the guards, jumped the moat, ran to Versailles where I climbed into Mr Robespierre's bedroom, leaving him a small tray of milk chocolates and an insulting note.<eos> The rest was easy.<eos> That is an incredible story, worthy of the Scarlet Pimpernel himself.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I, on the other hand, would.
It is somewere... Ty Cobb signed it.<eos> 1911, the year he hit 420.<eos> He was a mean guy, Cobb.<eos> He came at me many times with his spikes up.<eos> But he was the best.<eos> Better than Babe Ruth?<eos> Better and tougher... And meaner... And faster.<eos> But less home runs like the Babe though.<eos> Would you like to have the ball?<eos> Sure I would!
Julie, come on.<eos> It was a plane crash.<eos> Those things just happen.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> We were all supposed to go to the beach that day.<eos> But I said I had to study because I wanted to spend the day with you.<eos> So they took the plane to Catalina instead.<eos> Come on.<eos> Your mom and dad wouldn't want you to blame yourself all the rest of your life.<eos> Would they?
- Fine.<eos> Then call in the FBI<eos> - and let Brice take his chances.<eos> - That decision is not yours.<eos> What we will do is catch this Yuri before anyone knows what's happened.<eos> - Then we'll handle the rest.<eos> - You mean the men in the next room.<eos> The man is a spy and a murderer.<eos> Would anyone deny that justice had been done?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
It would never work with us.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - It just wouldn't.<eos> - Give me a reason.<eos> - You're always moving around.<eos> - You never stay in one place.<eos> - I wasn't the one who left, remember?<eos> That was eight years ago.<eos> I've changed.<eos> So would I for you.
You're out of your mind.<eos> Do you realize how many people saw you?<eos> -You're nailed. -No, no.<eos> -You are.<eos> You're nailed.<eos> -You are.<eos> Who'd believe that I was in a parade?<eos> Who the hell am I?<eos> Besides, anybody who would nail me wouldn't go to a parade.<eos> -My mother would.
Rachel Samstat.<eos> I saw you on Meet The Press.<eos> I read your article about ice-cream.<eos> I disagree with you about Häagen-Dazs Rum Raisin.<eos> What can I say?<eos> - You were so vicious about it.<eos> - I'm a vicious person.<eos> That's what I hear.<eos> Next time you have one of those food contests down at the magazine, I'd like to be a judge.<eos> I really would.
Do you have a box spring and mattress?<eos> I can handle it for you.<eos> No, I would need a nice hard mattress and box spring... ... andI 'dIikeyou to deliver it all together.<eos> Oh, you will want to select it.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> well.<eos> I need... .<eos> What else do we need?<eos> Four big pillows.<eos> would you Iike goose down or Dacron pillows?
I know it's not safe for you here. Go on.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go on!<eos> Solitude, isolation.<eos> Alone.<eos> Number Five, come on!<eos> Lonely bum.<eos> Number five, please.<eos> If I went to jail, who would take care of my animals?<eos> You sure wouldn't.
You said, "Don't move." Do it.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Do exactly what I tell you to do.<eos> I've got a 7:30 karate class. I can't help you.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> Follow him.<eos> Oh, I knew you were gonna say that.<eos> Don't get offended by this question, but are you gonna kill me or something? - No.<eos> - I suppose you wouldn't tell me if you were.<eos> - Sure I would. - Really?
- Hidden.<eos> - Let's find it.<eos> Supposing you're right about all of this.<eos> What about that ship up there?<eos> What's it doing?<eos> We can't know that, but we've got to assume the worst.<eos> Maybe they're like the vampires of legend.<eos> How's that?<eos> They would carry their Earth with them, in their coffins.<eos> Wouldn't they?
Well you are in its least noticed.<eos> Hey Pete, are you sure this thing works?<eos> There is no ringing in. Sometimes he does it, sometimes not. If he does... you will regret it!<eos> I tell you Jack, there is something wrong with those people.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That old lady is ok. Maybe a little crazy. But we must stay here.<eos> I do not understand how we are verzeild have to get.<eos> Oh so now is a flat band officially my fault.<eos> You had to go through to Montgomery.<eos> You would not!
Make 'em smaller.<eos> I'll give you small.<eos> This place is so small you have to go outside to change your mind.<eos> My turn.<eos> Ring, damn you.<eos> I can't believe he didn't call.<eos> - He'll call.<eos> - Do you think so?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
- Of course.<eos> Why wouldn't he?<eos> - Yeah, why wouldn't he!<eos> Maybe he'll call, I don't know.<eos> When I talked to him, he seemed funny.<eos> Like, "l'll call you later, babe."<eos> I don't think he'll call.<eos> - Don't worry, he'll call.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Why wouldn't he?
I didn't mean it.<eos> I didn't mean it, I swear.<eos> What have you been doing, Emma?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What is it, Momma?<eos> I really want to get some sleep so I look halfway decent for tomorrow.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> Would you want me to be silent about something for your own good?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I would!
Pay up, Mortimer, I've won the bet.<eos> Here, one dollar.<eos> We took a perfectly useless psychopath, like Valentine, and turned him into a successful executive.<eos> And during the same time, we turned an honest, hard-working man into a violently deranged, would-be killer.<eos> Now, what are we going to do about taking Winthorpe back and returning Valentine to the ghetto?<eos> I don't want Winthorpe back after what he's done.<eos> You mean keep Valentine on, as Managing Director?<eos> Do you really believe I would have a nigger run our family business, Randolph?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Neither would I.
- Let's dance.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's my favorite dance.<eos> - Oh, really, I don't dance.<eos> - You'll love it.<eos> - What? - Follow me.<eos> Follow me. - Please, I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'd... Really, I'd rather not.
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Anything?<eos> You're aware of the penalties for perjury?<eos> - It's a crime.<eos> - It is a crime.<eos> A serious crime.<eos> - I wouldn't do it.<eos> - You would not?
I've got a hunch, Admiral, we better stick to this 3 59 degree heading:<eos> What are you talking about, Buck?<eos> I don't intend to take this ship out to the very edges of the universe, beyond any known galaxy, just because of your hunch:<eos> Now, we can't have gotten that far off course:<eos> Crichton, how many grids are we away from Lambda Colony at this point?<eos> 508,000 Admiral, increasing geometrically at a rate of 62 grids per second, per second:<eos> What?<eos> Figure it again:<eos> That would mean taking decades to get there:<eos> Indeed, it would, Admiral:
- What?<eos> He knows about me?<eos> If you have a child, you'll tell him?<eos> If he ever suspects about you, I'd have to go away.<eos> What for?<eos> I couldn't live without you but I couldn't live with him if he knew about you.<eos> Wouldn't fret if you went away and never saw me again?<eos> Yes, I'd mind. I'd fret.<eos> - Should you mind?<eos> - Aye, that I would.
- A natural-born leader.<eos> - He's got me a little worried, is all.<eos> He's too much into this.<eos> He's at a pitch, man.<eos> He's always been like that, Eddie.<eos> After the Hulk, who would you want on your side if you were in a fight?<eos> - Well... Shawn.<eos> - Right.<eos> - First I'd want to talk my way out of the fight.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
You're allowed to talk mad to your friends, you know, if they are.<eos> They are, and you're allowed.<eos> Shit.<eos> She's a real nice girl.<eos> I know.<eos> - A piece of luck.<eos> - I think.<eos> - But I don't have to like it.<eos> - Hell, no.<eos> I wouldn't either.
Let's get out of here before she blows.<eos> Hold me for a second, then drop me, I'll kiss the ground.<eos> - You sure you're okay?<eos> - Fine. But no more flying.<eos> - Good morning!<eos> Are you injured?<eos> - It seems not.<eos> A miracle.<eos> I expect you'd like to use my phone?<eos> - I would.
- Yeah, I got it.<eos> - Very good.<eos> Put it out! Put it out!<eos> Here's the script, boss.<eos> You're sure this is the one they're filming over there now?<eos> - I swiped it right off the truck.<eos> - Well, this stinks.<eos> I wouldn't buy a car from anybody who put this kind of shit on TV.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - I wouldn't.
Varek will turn it off:<eos> Varek, don't you hear me?<eos> Put that grotesque body of yours to some use: : :<eos> And turn it off:<eos> It's done:<eos> We're not handing out medals, Varek:<eos> If I'm not mistaken, this should be the final obstacle:<eos> - Is that correct, Mr: Selvan?<eos> - I wouldn't know:<eos> Of course you would:
I don't care about that.<eos> I just want to know what's happened to Boxey.<eos> Welcome to Carillon.<eos> You are impressed?<eos> Confused would be more like it.<eos> Listen, we've lost a little boy.<eos> He is safe.<eos> We found him and brought him here.<eos> Would you care to join him?<eos> Yes, we would.
I'm not your source on Haldeman.<eos> Okay, look, when you were questioned by the Grand Jury... You had to name names.<eos> - Of course, everything they asked, yes.<eos> - Lf they asked you. All right if they...<eos> I don't know... Say we wrote a story that said that Haldeman... was the fifth name to control the fund.<eos> - Would we be in any trouble?<eos> - Would we be wrong?<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> I would have no problems if you wrote a story like that.<eos> - You wouldn't?
- George can't finish her. - I don't care.<eos> You don't comb Mrs. Karpf till 4. Why can't you finish it?<eos> - I'm busy till 4. - Doing what?<eos> - Whatever I feel like.<eos> - And whenever you feel like it.<eos> It's all right. Shut up.<eos> Hi. Come on in.<eos> - You like a drink or something?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Well, I would.
- Would I lie to a nice ape like you?<eos> Hmm, I've decided.<eos> - It's a good job.<eos> - Thank you, boss.<eos> Back to work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who taught you to build a fence like that?<eos> - Abraham Lincoln.<eos> - I'd like to meet him.<eos> So would I, Massa, so would I.
Oh, no. No.<eos> Take this to your family. - No, I can't.<eos> Thanks anyway. But please, I can't accept.<eos> Oh, what a nice pear!<eos> I'm Clemenza, do you still have my goods?<eos> Did you look inside?<eos> I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.<eos> A friend of mine has a nice rug.<eos> Maybe your wife would like it.<eos> Sure she would.
I thought she'd burnt this.<eos> She could not.<eos> Maybe in our new home, Otto Schultz will change his mind.<eos> I could give her to my daughter.<eos> Otto Schultz says we must leave as soon as possible.<eos> The sheep need water.<eos> Father, is there no other way but to leave our home?<eos> Oh, Gretchen, not a way.<eos> -Mother would know what to do.<eos> -Yes, she would.
I ain't having' no accidents just because of you.<eos> Come on. Don't give me any grief.<eos> I'm warning ya.<eos> Spare me, killer.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - I don't like that surfing' shit.<eos> Rock and roll's been goin' downhill ever since Buddy Holly died.<eos> Don't you think the Beach Boys are boss?<eos> - You would, you grungy little twerp.
Passenger Pivert...<eos> Passenger Pivert.<eos> Would M. Pivert, come to the information counter!<eos> - They're here. - Arkoum, Slimane and Pivert.<eos> Division chief!<eos> Good timing. They just paged Pivert.<eos> Block the exits and let's go!<eos> But, careful, he's a killer!<eos> Please, Mlle, try again.<eos> Would passenger Piver...
I mean...<eos> I'm afraid of her, you see. I've been wanting to divorce her.<eos> The first six months of marriage, I knew I made a mistake.<eos> But no, I got ahold of this first, before she did... and I thought, "Well, I'll answer it."<eos> But I wanted to be honest, and I'm a man of conscience... so I wanted to make sure.<eos> If I put down I'm the head of the family... nobody would know the difference, right?<eos> I really like you.<eos> Are you married? - No.<eos> When you get married... don't be like that whippo I married.<eos> Would you?
But he had far too many responsibilities for marriage and I suppose he never met the right woman.<eos> Then there was the business.<eos> I don't know what's going to happen to the company now.<eos> I can't run it and I don't want to bring anyone in from the outside.<eos> - You won't have to.<eos> - And what does that mean?<eos> - I am an officer of the company.<eos> - In name only.<eos> That's because Bryce would never let me participate.<eos> Of course he wouldn't.
Give us a hand here.<eos> He's heavier than a baby whale!<eos> - It's all quiet out there, Sergeant.<eos> - Let's hope it stays that way, Captain.<eos> You'd better leave that bandage alone, unless you want to start bleeding again.<eos> - How do you feel?<eos> - I hurt.<eos> - You hit your head on a rock.<eos> - I feel like a fool letting' you take me.<eos> I would, too.
It was a yellow Winton Flyer.<eos> As for my friend Boon Hogganbeck, he found his souls lily maid, the virgins love of his rough and innocent heart.<eos> Does Boss know you're splashing water on this thing four hours a day?<eos> You'll soak all the paint off it.<eos> Step back, will you, you're getting dust on the magneto.<eos> Sure is pretty.<eos> - How do you start this thing?<eos> - What do you wanna know for?<eos> There's a lovely lady across town who'd take notice if I chugged up in this.<eos> She would, huh?
If you want it all out at once, hook to the axle.<eos> Stop shoving.<eos> Just watch.<eos> OK, it's hooked.<eos> Y'all ready?<eos> Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention.<eos> Maybe I'd better.<eos> Prices have doubled round here since last year. $6 now.<eos> Maybe you'd rather walk back to Jefferson than pay $2 more.<eos> Maybe the boy and that other fella wouldn't.
Red priority.<eos> Red priority. - Isn't it in working order?<eos> - It seems to be.<eos> Then someone should have heard you.<eos> Captain Kirk here.<eos> Please answer red priority.<eos> Please answer red priority.<eos> Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering.<eos> Why should they do that?<eos> They wouldn't.
It was obvious.<eos> I could see at first glance that she was just putting it on.<eos> - Remember what she looks like?<eos> - Sure I do.<eos> Who could forget what she looked like?<eos> The way she was decked out in red, she looked like a cardinal.<eos> She had good legs though.<eos> Joe, call Tony.<eos> I figured Diabolik would make a play for those emeralds.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Over 400 cubes.<eos> Dual quads, all synchro box, zero to 60 under five.<eos> All right, Miss Bennett.<eos> I'll see to this gentleman myself.<eos> May I be of service, sir?<eos> I see that you're a person who appreciates fine things.<eos> You're no doubt aware that this is the celebrated Thorndyke special.<eos> Allow me to say, sir, that I think this car would suit you very well.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it would.
-No, she's nervous.<eos> -Come on. Isn't it right?<eos> -Give some corn to the chicks.<eos> Give the chick a little corn!<eos> Come on, Pepe.<eos> She's real racy!<eos> All those here have boyfriends or are married... They know...<eos> Remember what happened if our husbands caught us in a thing like this?<eos> -They'd cut a limb from us...<eos> -They would...
- The gold of Cairo.<eos> How did you know?<eos> They say it's worth millions.<eos> What is a man's family worth?<eos> Can you count a mother's love?<eos> Can you spend a sister's kiss?<eos> I want to see my Gina dressed in silks.<eos> I want to see her wearing a white wedding gown.<eos> But who would marry the sister of a thief?<eos> I would.
Not after all these years.<eos> - He's forgotten by now.<eos> - You haven't.<eos> If Johnny Reno does come in here looking for me... you tell him that I've left town and you don't know where I've gone.<eos> Is it that bad, Nona?<eos> Please, just do as I ask.<eos> And turn off that damned piano.<eos> Doc says he's gonna survive the bullet wound.<eos> But I wouldn't say how long he's gonna live.<eos> I would.
My wife.<eos> My wife gets sick quite easily.<eos> Your wife is Martha.<eos> I know.<eos> She doesn't really spend any time in a rest home?<eos> Your wife?<eos> No, yours.<eos> Mine?<eos> She doesn't.<eos> I would.
- I mean, Mr. Edwards and I don't need a chaperone.<eos> A chaperone?<eos> I guess the wife is always the Iast to know.<eos> well, I am an ex-wife, but I'd still like to know, whatever it is.<eos> You divorced him, so it's open season.<eos> And I think he's quite a man.<eos> -But you're barely older than--<eos> -nevertheless.<eos> My age doesn't bother Dan.<eos> It wouldn't at his age.
- You mean, detectives?<eos> - Yeah, a little bit.<eos> I even got custody of the kids.<eos> Aside from that, I'm free as the wind.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Lonely.<eos> You know, it's...<eos> It's been lonely ever since you left.<eos> Look, Laura baby, if there's anything at all like the old spark between us, I'd marry you this time.<eos> Honest I would.
He's on his way.<eos> What about those influential parties that wanted Clouseau on the case?<eos> Whatever they do to me now... it is not half of what he has done already.<eos> Besides... I feel certain I know who is behind those influential requests.<eos> - Ballon. - Ballon?<eos> It's obvious he was having an affair with Maria Gambrelli.<eos> Most likely.<eos> At first I couldn't understand why anyone... would want a man like Clouseau to be in charge of a murder case. Especially a case of this importance.<eos> - But why would Ballon?<eos> - He wouldn't.
MAN: Lord Frinton.<eos> Lord Frinton.<eos> His Majesty is waiting to present you with the cup.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I'm mad about him.<eos> Angela St. Simeon said something about it not being important.<eos> Not really important, I mean.<eos> Something about your clutching for your youth.<eos> Angela would.
I hate things like that.<eos> You know what I'd like for lunch?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> A big plate of French fries and a malt.<eos> How long until we get to Lepingsville?<eos> Well, I'm beginning to think that perhaps we won't make it this evening.<eos> We got off to rather a slow start, remember?<eos> Can we go to a movie tonight?<eos> If that's what you'd like.<eos> I would.
Did I?<eos> I didn't mean anything.<eos> I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but academic enlightenment.<eos> The Think System.<eos> I've been by your house to explain it to you but there always seem to be people around.<eos> Ladies mostly, I thought.<eos> Yes. Mrs. Squires and several of the other ladies.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.<eos> "You wouldn't?"
- Walk by the lake?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Have a beer?<eos> Hate beer.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Let's try something we've never done before, like getting married.<eos> Even after we're married we'll be saying the same things every night.<eos> - Movies, a walk by the lake...<eos> - I wouldn't like to think that.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
It's your duty.<eos> - It's your duty.<eos> - You don't have to wake us all.<eos> - I'll get 'em up, Sergeant.<eos> - Thanks, Parson.<eos> Hey.<eos> Two dollars American if you take out my patrol.<eos> Two dollars?<eos> This morning I wouldn't take your patrol for ten.<eos> - I would.
What else is there to do but... wait?<eos> It's Calvera's move.<eos> Right.<eos> Now you'd better replace the guards.<eos> They must be tired.<eos> - If you were Calvera...<eos> - Yes?<eos> You'd go away, wouldn't you?<eos> If you'd paid the price we make him pay.<eos> Yes, I would, only...
Yes, I certainly did, Jim.<eos> - And I told the professor that he was...<eos> - It's not a he, it's a she.<eos> I'm glad I didn't know that when I wrote that letter... or I would have really sound...<eos> You mean to tell me now they've got dames... teaching unsuspecting suckers how to...<eos> Now, Jim. I'm not supposed to get excited.<eos> I don't want to get excited. But when I read your letter...<eos> I just wrote exactly what I thought of journalism classes.<eos> You wouldn't want me to lie, would you?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Thank you.<eos> Oh, uh...<eos> Mr. Moore, are you employed?<eos> No.<eos> Is it not a fact that you are supported by your stepsister?<eos> Yes.<eos> So naturally, you are grateful to her.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Now, according to the terms of your late stepfather's will, should anything happen to Marylin, who would inherit her money?<eos> Why, I would.
Now, then, how would you like to proceed?<eos> Kono naka kara dareka hitori erandara dodeshoka ne? He would like to pick his opponent.<eos> Oh, fine!<eos> Fine.<eos> Come on in. Here are the boys.<eos> He prefers this young man.<eos> Well, now, wait a minute. I don't wanna tell Mr. Togo his business here, but you... You'd better tell him that I'd better wrestle him.<eos> He still prefers this man to wrestle with.<eos> Well, excuse... Would you be good enough to ask him for me, please, why he wants me?<eos> I would... I would... Naze kono hito ga iindesu ka?
He said it was the last refuge of a scoundrel, sir.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I meant nothing personal.<eos> You're tired, Dax.<eos> You're very tired.<eos> It's you who are exhausted, not your men, and it's my fault.<eos> I've given you one impossible task after another.<eos> You need rest badly.<eos> - I haven't said that!<eos> - And you never would, either.
- Oh, it's a very sad story.<eos> My father and mother were the duc and duchesse de Monchartres... and they both died before I was born.<eos> - Both.<eos> - Yes. It was during a typhoon.<eos> Our yacht overturned in the Sargasso Sea... and I was the only survivor.<eos> - If you don't believe my story, I have several others... which are much more interesting.<eos> I'm sure you have.<eos> I only tell the stories because nobody believes the truth.<eos> Would you like to dance now?<eos> Uh, yes. I - I would.
- I'm working.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Listen, I asked you nice, didn't I?<eos> You want me to ask you not nice?<eos> Sure. Might as well have both versions.<eos> Johnny.<eos> You think the Gimp found out you talked to the girl?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If he has, you think I should crawl into the laundry and apologize?<eos> Well, I would.
Any reward?<eos> Grove didn't say.<eos> Sorry, I don't inform on my friends.<eos> I'd like to meet them.<eos> You going to be hanging around Diablo a while?<eos> It appears likely.<eos> I got a friend named Rosita and she's got a friend named Sally.<eos> You're informing!<eos> Maybe you'd like to see some cattle ranches around here?<eos> That I would.
If he's so set on going, let him go alone.<eos> It doesn't take two to shoot at a shadow.<eos> Grace, you're getting yourself all worked up.<eos> Why do you do whatever he wants?<eos> You know you do.<eos> You always do!<eos> I'll bring your little Arty back home safe and sound, Gracie.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> If it was just you, I'd wish it was black.<eos> Yes, I would!
And it's possible.<eos> Don't say that to me, Ed.<eos> I'm Army, I like it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You were probably pretty good at Gettysburg.<eos> But this isn't Gettysburg.<eos> What do you know about Gettysburg?<eos> You've never been east of the Pecos.<eos> If you had, you wouldn't wear those Rebel pants.<eos> - Sure I would.
A lot of people were outside the house.<eos> Then the inspector told me I could leave.<eos> What a terrible thing.<eos> A very terrible thing.<eos> Father, why did you come to Villette's house this morning?<eos> Father, I must speak to you.<eos> I know what you must think of me but I can't give myself up.<eos> They would hang me.<eos> Hasn't God forgiven me, thanks to you?<eos> But the police never would.
You're here early, anyway.<eos> Why don't you go home and shave? Shave?<eos> Yeah, or else keep quiet till Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.<eos> Hey, what kind of a routine is that?<eos> What are you two guys up to? Who's Smitty?<eos> He's a guy that we met. You wouldn't care for him.<eos> What am I supposed to look at?<eos> No, just a couple of Irving's dames.<eos> You wouldn't like them.<eos> Maybe you would.
Can't you see you're not wanted?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> The next time you feel like snooping around Ox Head Woods, read the signs, the part about "at your own risk."<eos> Why?<eos> Because some yellow belly'll sock me in the dark?<eos> Because I got full rights to them woods.<eos> - Who gave 'em to you?<eos> - Pete Morgan.<eos> Then would you be knowing how Meg broke her leg?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
-Would Her Highness care to gamble?<eos> -Gamble?<eos> She's done it for a living.<eos> I'll bet you a dollar I've been to the place of your birth.<eos> -Zhifu.<eos> -It's on the China coast, Zhifu.<eos> The second wickedest city in the world.<eos> -The first? -Macau.<eos> Wouldn't you say?<eos> I would.
- Well, it's so sudden.<eos> - I'm supposed to say that.<eos> I never thought that you...<eos> Of course not. Not when you're one jump ahead of the police at all times.<eos> But you've changed.<eos> Now you even insist on taking a morning walk. You've never got out of bed before noon unless the mattress caught on fire.<eos> - You're different in a lot of ways.<eos> - Am I?<eos> We might find this all very boring.<eos> I wouldn't.
He was hanging around the dock after you left.<eos> You have a good memory for one who drinks.<eos> Drinking don't bother my memory.<eos> If it did I wouldn't drink.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> You see... I'd forget how good it was.<eos> Then where would I be?<eos> - I'd start drinking water again.<eos> - Maybe you'd forget about water, too.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Yes, I guess they would.<eos> You know, guys like that, they're liable to expect a fella to spend his last two days going places and seeing the town.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, thanks for the bag.<eos> I mean, with somebody.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, thanks for the bag.<eos> Thanks for the bag. Say, do you think we could go out together and have dinner tonight? Say, do you think we could go out together and have dinner tonight?<eos> You forget I'm engaged and, uh, I don't think he'd like it.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Don't make me.<eos> Don't make me!<eos> Don't make her.<eos> The doctor wants Christine to exercise and...<eos> I'll see that she has some exercise.<eos> I have to take my car to the town to have it washed.<eos> Christine could go, we'll walk back.<eos> Or run if you like.<eos> If Christine would be kind enough to go with me.<eos> Would you?
Mother always thought... She always talked about grand opera for me. Imagine.<eos> But my voice isn't that kind.<eos> It's just, you know what mothers are like.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> - Have you got a piano?<eos> - A piano?<eos> - Yes, there's one in the parlor.<eos> - Would you sing for me?<eos> - You wouldn't want to hear me sing.<eos> Yes, I would.
- As it is, though...<eos> - You get out of that chair once more...<eos> Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.<eos> Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife... and won't be unfaithful to her technically.<eos> - Why doesn't he make up his mind?<eos> - Rhett, you...<eos> Observe my hands, my dear.<eos> I could tear you to pieces with them.<eos> And I'd do it if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever.<eos> But it wouldn't.
If you win, that will divide us too.<eos> I'll win, and nothing will divide us.<eos> Is it so hard to believe in me?<eos> No.<eos> I'll even forgive you if you need it.<eos> Here.<eos> My father gave me this ring and said if ever he lost his temper with me to bring it to him and he'd forgive me.<eos> And once, long after when he'd forgotten and was angry it saved my life.<eos> Darling, if you're ever angry, rings won't help.<eos> Yes, this one would.
Everything's going to be all right.<eos> "Everything's going to be all right."<eos> Certainly, everything's going to be all right.<eos> Everything's going to be...<eos> I'm losing my mind, that's all. Roaming around Connecticut without any clothes on.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> How can all these things happen to just one person?<eos> Susan, where are you?<eos> Will you come out and help me find some clothes or must I come in and get you?<eos> You wouldn't.
- Philippe?<eos> He smiles too much.<eos> Oh, but I like people to smile.<eos> But do sit down, or I'll think you want to hurry away.<eos> I was wondering whether...<eos> - Did you hunt this morning?<eos> - No.<eos> It would be fun to go with you sometimes.<eos> I thought you'd like to see this.<eos> Yes, I would.
Will you take me to him?<eos> - Take me to him.<eos> A moment, do you mind?<eos> - Wait.<eos> I think not.<eos> Oh, you're not...<eos> Philippe, you don't mean that you...<eos> I would be ruined if I were to accompany you tonight.<eos> Thas right.<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
