Pulse beacon.<eos> Advice from an old tracker.<eos> You want to find someone, use your eyes.<eos> How long do you think you can really run from us?<eos> I never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains.<eos> And if you're the best they got ...<eos> Captain Reynolds, I should tell you, so that you don't waste your time, you can't make me angry.<eos> Please, spend an hour with him.<eos> I want to resolve this like civilized men.<eos> I'm not threatening you.

He was driving the limousine that Cheryl Frazier and Stan Fields were in the day they were kidnapped.<eos> I wanted to know why you parked so far away from the entrance of the home.<eos> Yeah, why would you do that?<eos> Why? So if I could show you something....<eos> Well, it's not these. lt's not my badge.<eos> Well, what do you--?<eos> It's my deployment schedule and if you can look where it says "tomorrow's events."<eos> -Yeah, go ahead, read aloud.<eos> -"Nine a.m. press conference...<eos> -...at the Venetian"? -Speak up, we cannot hear you!
Are you coming to bed?<eos> Yeah, right after this game.<eos> Just for a sec.<eos> - Okay. - What can it hurt?<eos> - I've got to get back.<eos> - We'll just look, all right?<eos> - How much is this?<eos> - Much too much.<eos> Don't look. Don't even look.<eos> - May I help you?
Nice and...<eos> Maybe a little less lonely.<eos> She sounds like a manipulative little nincompoop.<eos> - The girl lost her mother. - So?<eos> You lost your daughter.<eos> - It's not the same.<eos> - It's worse.<eos> A parent burying a child goes against the law of nature.<eos> Well, so does a grandparent abandoning her grandchildren.<eos> You said yourself he didn't want you around.
Ava Fontaine.<eos> In my neighborhood they say,<eos> "The good get out."<eos> In our own ways, we'd both conquered the world.<eos> You can't force somebody to fall in love with you. But you can definitely improve your odds.<eos> It cost me 20 grand to book he for a fake photo shoot. Another twelve to buy out the hotel.<eos> Popular hotel, huh?<eos> Ava Fontaine.<eos> Yuri Orlov.<eos> What brings you to St. Barts?
De Angelis, Marco.<eos> First day of school.<eos> I'm so nervous.<eos> A new student.<eos> Good start!<eos> I must see him.<eos> But he isn't here.<eos> Holidays are over for everybody, except for him.<eos> I am Marco De Angelis.<eos> You know I should kick you out?
Oh. Come on.<eos> Come on to Uncle Lance.<eos> No, no, don't. Come back.<eos> Oh yeah!<eos> Oh, my Lord. They're just like little rose petals.<eos> Oh! Oh, bingo!<eos> Oh God, Lance, you're a lucky man.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Can I help you?
- I'm getting rid of them.<eos> - So they are yours?<eos> I was taking them into town.<eos> Come with me.<eos> They said, they'd kill me.<eos> - But people in this town don't act. - No.<eos> That was probably for the best.<eos> It's still bloody annoying.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> I think I have to keep you until tomorrow.
Hey, how's that Karasz thing coming?<eos> Slow.<eos> There's a lot to sift through.<eos> Well, George Szamos said he set up a meeting with you... and you blew him off?<eos> What...<eos> I didn't mean to leave him with that impression.<eos> I'll hook up with him Monday morning. I promise.<eos> This is important, David.<eos> I know, sir.<eos> I'm not gonna let you down.
You wrote that.<eos> I read it.<eos> A young man's theories.<eos> But you proved it.<eos> I survived, if that's what you mean.<eos> But did I live?<eos> Not really.<eos> He didn't force you to wander from him.<eos> He allowed you to out of love.<eos> And if you find now that you're lost, you must have faith that his love will guide you back.
Answer when spoken to!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come here.<eos> What are you doing here, old man?<eos> Are you looking for trouble?<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I just came to see my harvest, in that cornfield.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> And if I see you here again, you're dead.
It says it was fraud.<eos> You got six months suspended. Yes, that's right.<eos> And I'm going to appeal once I get back.<eos> We can't do much for you.<eos> Go to the police to report the theft. You'll get temporary papers.<eos> I'm an American citizen.<eos> I have rights. lt's in the constitution that my great grandparents fought all their life for.<eos> And I would appreciate my country's help.<eos> Algeria may have fought for its independence, but not the States'.<eos> I remind you that your green card obliges you to respect certain rules written clearly on the back which you haven't bothered to read.
You should say 3 times goodmorning to your first patient of the day, do you know that?<eos> - Where`s the blotting paper?<eos> - I got it readyt for you.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Without blotting paper you can`t write.<eos> Professor Ravaglia says that.<eos> He bought two wedding gifts for 1 coin, two for 5O and another one and 50 with a little bike.<eos> Good.<eos> (theatre) "He was provoking a woman`s death.<eos> "The police doesn`t like you?"
This is for "that one".<eos> "That one" is my mother.<eos> Don`t pretend you don`t understand.<eos> Tomorrow we leave, got it?<eos> "Dear Mrs Liliana.<eos> your letter found me alive.<eos> "We celebrated a long service for Edgardo,<eos> "three beads long.<eos> "I remember you very well, especially at night.<eos> "when you wanted me to take you to pick up shells.
"because recently only bombs arise from the fields and from the sea.<eos> "I would like to help you.<eos> "We have food and our house is big and empty.<eos> "My devotion to you has not changed.<eos> "I would like to meet you son Fido.<eos> "He is the only nephew I have.<eos> "I would like to meet you here soon.<eos> like the flash in the photo.<eos> "But such miracles can only happen in the city, and not in the countryside.<eos> "So, I don`t believe you I will see you again.
She was tricked by the mirror!<eos> When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart.<eos> What's all this about?<eos> It doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> Hi!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have something to say.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'll tell you later.
- I let him into your office.<eos> - Shouldn't I have?<eos> - No, you did well to.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Pilate.<eos> Sozio Melato, Inspector.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Catarella gets names mixed up.<eos> Have a seat. Thanks.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I asked our friend Zito to introduce me to you because I have some information which may be of interest to you.
Gong-gil!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> So, I see.<eos> we're not hunting quails, are we?<eos> By selfless sacrifice, ministers have built this kingdom.<eos> Yet you invite gutter rats to mock us?<eos> When my father sentenced my mother to death... You were the one who delivered the poison!<eos> Her blood is on your hands!<eos> Heaven has seen the evils of your tyranny.<eos> And will punish you for it.
Dean's going after his archives.<eos> If we can beat him to it, we'd have access to Dean's entire operation.<eos> They said they're being held at Rue L'Or.<eos> Where's that? Well, looks like it's in Monte Carlo, one of Moreau's fronts.<eos> Hey, it's a casino.<eos> What do we do with all that money we seized?<eos> Having trouble sleeping, Mr. Sloane?<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> You'd have to count a lot of sheep to erase today's proceedings, that's for sure.<eos> I'm guessing they're gonna put you away for a long time,
This is agent 4962 Bravo requesting the technician.<eos> This is he.<eos> Dr. Desantis, this is Kelly Peyton.<eos> Were you able to retrieve agent Vaughn's files?<eos> Yes. I'm exiting Cha-kow street now.<eos> I'll run the analysis and be in touch.<eos> Excellent. I'll let our benefactors know.<eos> What's all that noise?<eos> You know how it is... rough neighborhood.<eos> After your initial triage and check-in, we'll bring you up here to the labor and delivery rooms.
- Me.<eos> That was-That was me.<eos> But, um, her?<eos> Look, it's just a pre-engagement. It's exciting.<eos> You know, it's young love.<eos> I had it once.<eos> A man I loved-<eos> - Here's young Maeby's blouse.<eos> - And then things took a turn somehow.<eos> Master Bluth. I haven't seen you in a week's time.
Really, really busy, at the moment.<eos> Snowed under.<eos> But if you get in touch with one of my aides, there might be a small window tomorrow.<eos> I'm not promising anything, honestly.<eos> But, I might be able to give you an interview then... if that's what you would like.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good. Well, you just... carry on.<eos> What a strange little man.<eos> Captain Adama...<eos> I hardly recognized you with your clothes on.
- "Eh"? ! What does that even mean?<eos> Means wait until our bug and slime guy takes a look.<eos> No clothing.<eos> You know, in my line of work, no clothes usually means a sex crime.<eos> In my line of work, it can also mean the victim favored natural fibers.<eos> Your suit, for example, will outlast your bones by decades.<eos> Collect silt, three meters radius to a depth of ten centimeters.<eos> Your FBI forensics team can take the plastic and the chicken wire, we'll take the rest.<eos> Dr. Goodman, I wish you wouldn't just give me to the FBI.<eos> As a federally funded institution, the Jeffersonian must seize every opportunity to prove our worth to our friends in Congress, which means I loan you out as I see fit, especially to federal agencies.

I think I'll...<eos> Fold.<eos> You want to tell me what this is all about ?<eos> When did playing poker become a felony ?<eos> Recognize that jacket ?<eos> What are you, the lost and found ?<eos> Keep it...<eos> It's worthless.<eos> No, actually, it's invaluable...<eos> It places you at the murder scene.
You still took a copy and distributed it and profited from her death.<eos> Look, I didn't mean to kill her !<eos> You left her in the park, Leonard !<eos> You didn't even make an anonymous call to 911 !<eos> - What am I supposed to think ?<eos> ! - That doesn't make me a killer !<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> And you can keep telling yourself that.<eos> All right ?<eos> Because I'm going to take you to a place now where they have sex for no profit.
I took the kid to his piano lesson.<eos> Listen, i need you to head over to the impound, check out the judge's car.<eos> S.I.D.'s already been over the car.<eos> No, i'm not looking for Forensics.<eos> I want to know about the GPS system.<eos> 12 paces by 14 paces.<eos> GPS system.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, heads up.<eos> Pope's looking for you and not in a good way.
Um, do i get to keep the 75 grand?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> My client is free to go?<eos> Well, uh, no.<eos> Um, not exactly.<eos> This is special agent Howard.<eos> Um, he works with the FBI, and, um, we happen to be dating.<eos> Now i said i wasn't gonna charge you with anything and i won't, but, um, there's a new law making carjacking a federal offense, and i believe it has the death penalty attached to it.<eos> Mr. Howard here will fill you in on all the details.
Can't you get some help ?<eos> Aides cost money, and I'm the only one paying the bills around here.<eos> After I heard from you, I called Social Services.<eos> You're giving him up ?<eos> The State has places for kids like him.<eos> Maybe he'd be happier.<eos> You don't know what it's like.<eos> Raising an autistic kid is a 24-7 job.<eos> I have my own kids to worry about.<eos> No one is judging you.
Knowing this camp's without a minister, I come to be on call to the family.<eos> Shall I ask elsewhere or will you tell me their name?<eos> Bullock.<eos> - Their boy is at Cochran's cabin.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - $2 a room, if you're staying over.<eos> - I may.<eos> 50 cents off for clergy.<eos> $6 extra if they set up for dice in the room.<eos> Avoid looking left as you exit if idolatry offends you.
And if you are a counterfeit, the deception comes so naturally... I'd credit its source in such a soul, meaning cold and ungenerous... and as capable of counterfeit, manipulative and treacherous as well.<eos> Who can you think I am, Mrs Garret?<eos> - I, a poor working girl?<eos> - You are not.<eos> I only hope your high wroth, ma'am, don't bespeak some affair gone amiss.<eos> I hope to Christ not involving Mr Bullock.<eos> Even under such duress, you oughtn't presume to strike me.<eos> For who do you take me, then?<eos> For who do you mistake me?<eos> I mistake you for no one, Miss Isringhausen, and I know you for a fact.
How's his toothache?<eos> I ain't requiring about his toothache, Richardson.<eos> And you oughtn't be requiring about his toothache, either.<eos> You ought to be hoping that his nibs will be sleeping, so... we can both sneak away and go watch the ride.<eos> What are you, what are you-<eos> - You stupid-<eos> - Mr Farnum, are you in there?<eos> I need your permission, Mr Farnum.<eos> I'm coming in.<eos> What's killing you?

Thursday,coffee at 2.Be on time.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way,but are you dim?<eos> Okay,I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today, but the goal was to learn,not to judge.<eos> I bring the coffee.<eos> That crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.<eos> This is tunde.<eos> He lost both his parents to this drought.<eos> In fact,water is always scarce in botswana.<eos> The national currency is called the pula or raindrop... hello, Gabrielle.<eos> What brings you here?
Look,my wife cheated on me,too.<eos> I know how much it hurts.<eos> And so will a judge.<eos> Everyone understandscrimes of passion.<eos> But every daythat you stonewall makes you lookmore and more like a cold,calculating killer.<eos> We both knowthat's not you.<eos> But I can't help you unlessyou start telling the truth.<eos> I'm sorry,but I-I,um,I have to go.<eos> I have some thingsthat I need to take care of.<eos> Bree,it is obvious your husbandloved you very much.
You must have loved him a lot to make the bed before taking him to the hospital.<eos> I was in shock, danielle.<eos> You know that.<eos> Andrew, surely you don't think I murdered your father.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> You're not capable of murder.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> It takes guts to kill somebody.<eos> Thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me.
Have you got an appointment?<eos> No, just an old friend passing by, bit of a surprise.<eos> Can't wait to see her face.<eos> Well, she's just having a cup of tea.<eos> Just go in there and tell her the Doctor would like to see her.<eos> Doctor who?<eos> Just the Doctor.<eos> Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.<eos> Hang on a tick.<eos> The Lord Mayor says thank you for popping by.
You never phone in the middle of the day.<eos> What's so funny? - Nothing.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> - What day is it?<eos> - Wednesday. All day.<eos> You got a hangover?<eos> Put a quid in that Lottery syndicate.<eos> I'll pay you back later. Yeah.
Derek...<eos> I'm a sink with an open drain, Addie.<eos> Did you get them all? Yes.<eos> It wasn't easy or very pleasant.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Empty.<eos> I feel empty now.<eos> Yeah, I've been feeling a little bit of that myself lately.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Mr. Hubble, why does eating doll heads fill you up?
You can try.<eos> I'll have to take you down.<eos> Hey-- I may be short, but you're pretty tiny.<eos> I could do it.<eos> Right now, just in this moment, I hate you.<eos> Yeah, well--<eos> I can take it.<eos> All right, Dr. Grey.<eos> We're going to put you to sleep for a little while.<eos> But I promise, we'll have you back into surgery in no time.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Or... you could start thinking about moving in with me.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> What's up with doyle?<eos> I had to fire him.<eos> Get me some water.<eos> I'm drying up.<eos> Yeah, well, that's the tumor talking.<eos> Your i.v.'s keeping you hydrated.
Who would do this to themselves?<eos> The woman wasn't just in prison, Yang, she was in solitary.<eos> Well, she was seriously deranged.<eos> You try spending a month locked in a room with no windows, no one to talk to 23 hours a day, see how deranged she is then.<eos> Dr. Bailey, she's a murderer.<eos> I didn't say she wasn't.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> I said try having no one to make your snarky comments to for a solid month.<eos> My guess is you'd swallow the entire razor.<eos> How are they treating you, Mr. Murphy?
What if you're wrong?<eos> Couldn't unnecessary spinal surgery do more damage?<eos> If we wait any longer, we have a paralyzed man who can't breathe.<eos> I'm trusting my instincts.<eos> Sometimes you got to take a chance to save a life.<eos> Your mitral regurge is getting worse.<eos> The valves are leakier than ever.<eos> Are you hitting on me?<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I hear they call you Dr. Evilspawn.
I want you to convince her to make the decision for herself.<eos> And how am I supposed to do that?<eos> Dr. Karev, you're creative.<eos> You'll think of something.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This will be an extensive operation even for an open heart veteran like yourself.<eos> My room was bigger last time.<eos> It was brighter--more sun.<eos> Alan, this water is warm. I need more ice.<eos> I'm sending you in for a nuclear scan. Then we'll get you into the O.R. this afternoon.
Your hands. No hair, which means nerve damage.<eos> And your shoes look about two sizes too small which means you've lost sensation in your feet.<eos> And then there's your pants.<eos> My pants tell you I have diabetes?<eos> No, they tell me you're an idiot.<eos> Powdered sugar on the right pant leg.<eos> Based on the two napkins in your right pocket, I'm willing to bet it's not your first donut of the day.<eos> You're giving me the pills?<eos> Sure, why not?<eos> If you've got heart disease from ignoring the diabetes they'll kill you.
Really?<eos> Apparently, you know me better than I know you.<eos> I know that limp.<eos> I know the empty ring finger.<eos> And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret.<eos> You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing.<eos> The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatever.<eos> That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true.<eos> I got music, you got this.<eos> The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal.
I'm Dr. Foreman.<eos> I'm in charge of your case.<eos> You have aplastic anemia, which means your bone marrow has shut down.<eos> Your body can't make new blood anymore.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I went back and checked your old records.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> The aplastic anemia's apparently been developing for months.<eos> I'm sorry, we should have caught it earlier.<eos> So it's not just the latest white count that's leading you to feel this...
And I'm sure there are Web sites full of men... looking for married women with surgical scars.<eos> So have the surgery.<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Why have you been talking to Cameron?<eos> - If House picks you, I'll be needing a new source in that room.<eos> Foreman's smarter.<eos> House has got a thing for Cameron.<eos> I've been feeding you information so you'll protect me.<eos> And I will protect you as long as I need you.
Good day.<eos> Bergen-Belsen, January '43-June '43.<eos> Auschwitz, June '43-June '44.<eos> Then you went to Patin.<eos> After that, you disappeared.<eos> But in 1965 you were spotted in West Berlin.<eos> Listen, boy, I don't have time for this game.<eos> - Leave before I call the police.<eos> - Call them.<eos> I'm sure they'd love to meet you.
- Hear about what?<eos> The stories.<eos> Everything.<eos> What everything?<eos> Everything they're afraid to show us in school.<eos> You were there.<eos> You did those things.<eos> No one can tell it better than you.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> Then I'll leave you alone.
- I'll try. Thanks, Karl.<eos> Bye.<eos> Johnny.<eos> I can't promise anything, Mrs. Murdoch.<eos> We just have to play it as it comes.<eos> Johnny, we just wanted to help.<eos> Karl.<eos> Uncle Karl.<eos> Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble, well, maybe we could do something.<eos> Haven't seen you in so long.
I can't get up. I wrenched my back.<eos> We'll have to put off our dinner.<eos> I'm sorry for you.<eos> A sore back is no fun.<eos> It's silly. What are you doing next Wednesday?<eos> Next Wednesday... nothing.<eos> My friend's giving another dinner:<eos> you're invited.<eos> How very nice.<eos> We missed you today. We won't miss you next week.
Marlene!<eos> May I call you Marlene?<eos> Feel free.<eos> I haven't known him long, but I understand him: so take my advice.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Give it time: his wife has left him, but don't rush in.<eos> Be the sensuous, amusing mistress you are, all garter belts and champagne...<eos> Keep on seeing him 3 to 4 times a week, wait for your turn.<eos> He said he saw me 3 to 4 times a week?<eos> I felt he'd see you every day if he could.
It was in the brush.<eos> Well , you wouldn't have found it if I hadn't thrown it out.<eos> Hi .<eos> Sorry, he's not here.<eos> Henry Burton.<eos> Can I take a message?<eos> Oh, God. I see.<eos> How reliable is Daisy?<eos> Hundred percent.<eos> Then we just got bad news. An interview in Manhattan magzine, Ozio blasts you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> You could have killed him.<eos> No one here has any animosity towards you, Sergeant.<eos> None of us here is your enemy.<eos> Furthermore, we respect your qualities.<eos> We have no doubt that you are a very very good soldier.<eos> But because of your training we don't think you'll ever be able to function in a group like this:<eos> A community of families of children where the ability to fight is not the sole purpose of existence.<eos> You're different from us, Sergeant.<eos> We don't hate you for that.
BARNES:<eos> Plane crash.<eos> Good.<eos> There was no plane crash.<eos> Spacecraft.<eos> A spacecraft.<eos> I guess that explains a lot.<eos> NORMAN:<eos> NASA? BARNES:<eos> That doesn't surprise you?
Hi!<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me how to get to the county hospital?<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> I'll just take a moment to catch my breath.<eos> Breath!<eos> Maggie Rice.<eos> Are you a patient?<eos> No. I just need to find her, please.<eos> You'll have to call her office.<eos> Someone there can help you.
We'II broadcast right from in here.<eos> - hopefully they'II see it.<eos> - I'II try to get a message through.<eos> Let's remember, manypeople have had their lives changed forever.<eos> No one has been untouched ...<eos> There's no Ranger game on tonight.<eos> Ed, if you're seeing this, please Put us on live.<eos> I know this sounds crazy, but you have to do it.<eos> - Just trustme.<eos> - I'm not Putting you on live.
What is that?<eos> Milo. I've deced to give up men and get a cat.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> That's so sad.<eos> People will believe you.<eos> And you'll have to lock it up or something.<eos> Well, if your father and I are gonna be staying here...<eos> - Stay here?<eos> - Let me just get that for you.<eos> So, Bizzy, uh, what brings you here to L.A.?
In any case, we're going to have to try to find another way to treat your condition.<eos> Let's start with a micro-cellular scan. No!<eos> I don't want medical treatment.<eos> I will resolve this myself.<eos> How do you intend to do that?<eos> There are certain meditative techniques.<eos> I will be fine if simply left alone.<eos> Please... allow me to return to my quarters.<eos> Confine me there if you wish, but allow me to resolve my situation privately.<eos> Until I have a better idea of how to treat your condition... I'll release you to your quarters.
Then I think:<eos> "Why would a person stay in such a demeaning job just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?<eos> Gee, I don't know, Rach.<eos> Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans, and a Howdy, hold the Doody.<eos> Come on, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't--<eos> I don't mind paying my dues.<eos> But how much will I learn about fashion by walking Myra, the arthritic seamstress to the bathroom?<eos> Hi.<eos> Is my misery amusing to you?
It's okay.<eos> Are we sure we don't want the waterbed?<eos> Haven't we made this decision?<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> -Who is it?<eos> -lt's Allesandro, from Allesandro 's.<eos> I want to talk to you about your review.<eos> Call me on the phone.<eos> What? So you can hang up on me?<eos> I'll never let you up, so just go away.
Gunther, have you seen Chandler?<eos> I thought you were Chandler.<eos> But one of you is over there.<eos> Hey, Joe.<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> How cute is the on-call doctor?<eos> So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.<eos> Dr. Burke will see you now.
I'll be right with you.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> How cute is the on-call doctor?<eos> So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.<eos> Dr. Burke will see you now.<eos> Not Dr. Burke.<eos> The on-call doctor will see me now.<eos> Dr. Richard Burke is out.<eos> Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
- He needs help getting around?<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> May I ask you what you mean by that, ma'am?<eos> Mac, we played pool tonight.<eos> Beat the pants off a couple of flyers from El Toro.<eos> Is that what you do in your spare time, Schiparelli?<eos> Hustle Marines?<eos> No, ma'am, I usually prefer a challenge.<eos> We'll probably need a ride around 9, if that's all right with you.<eos> Don't you need me to drive you back, sir?
- Since I graduated flight school, sir.<eos> Bet you thought you'd be landing on my gravesite.<eos> It is my personal belief, admiral, that you will outlast us all.<eos> Prosit.<eos> Having fun in Washington?<eos> Are you jigging and "JAG-ing"?<eos> - Well, it's stimulating, sir.<eos> - What about your old man?<eos> Getting closer to finding out what happened to him?<eos> Or are those stiffs on the hill still running you around?
Who said anything about a collision?<eos> Excuse me, skipper.<eos> Commander Rabb, Major MacKenzie and Lieutenant Roberts, sir.<eos> Commander Rabb reporting as ordered.<eos> Thank you, ensign.<eos> Welcome aboard the Cayuga.<eos> I assume you've been briefed?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Ensign Garret here will escort you to your quarters, major.
Keep your eyes open, all right?<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Trouble sleeping, commander?<eos> You just put at least 20 men into a life raft.<eos> Why?<eos> It was a routine training drill.<eos> Those men were saying goodbye.<eos> One of them was an officer I saw fighting in the ward room earlier.<eos> You are here as an observer, commander.<eos> This does not concern you.
He's waiting for you, sir.<eos> Your will is ready for your signature, sir.<eos> You aren't going to read it, sir?<eos> You did what I asked, didn't you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Then I don't have any need to read it, do I?<eos> Try out my chair, commander.<eos> My guess is it'll be yours in a couple years.<eos> Go ahead, Rabb.<eos> It's not gonna turn you into a growling old salt.
- As you were.<eos> You go, corporal.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> - Don't thank me.<eos> It's Commander Rabb's op.<eos> Let's go, Marines.<eos> All right, ma'am.<eos> You heard the major, move out.<eos> I won't let you down, sir.
It's just that I went and got tested last week and I'm waiting for the results.<eos> Tested?<eos> Not that I had any reason to.<eos> I mean, I really haven't been with that many... No.<eos> No, it's a good idea.<eos> I should do the exact same thing.<eos> You?<eos> You know, Bud, I did have a life before this.<eos> But I have a feeling the best is yet to come.<eos> Colonel Farrow, they're calling you "the Butcher of Palma Christi."
If I may, sir.<eos> You see returning the Declaration of Independence to Washington as an end.<eos> I see it as a beginning.<eos> It proves you didn't take it for money.<eos> And a trial gives you a public forum in which to plead your case to the American people.<eos> - And it would save Sarah's career.<eos> - To hell with my career.<eos> I don't wanna see you in prison, Uncle Matt.<eos> He won't necessarily go to prison.<eos> State set you up because you were a thorn in their side.
How else could he have gotten his people here before I arrived?<eos> So you think Draim had Tauvid killed to stop you from getting this crystal.<eos> And whoever he hired is probably still on the station.<eos> You can be sure that Draim wants to know what's on that crystal as much as I do.<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> Oh, I'm just picturing myself trying to explain all this to the authorities back on Finnea... not that they'll listen.<eos> They'll just send me to prison.<eos> I'm not turning this over to the Finneans.<eos> You're not?<eos> I'm placing you in protective custody while I have someone try to access the crystal.
I'll thank you to keep out of it.<eos> I'll have my officers report to the armoury within the hour.<eos> Now perhaps there's something you'd consent to do for me.<eos> A member of the station's Ruling Council. You?<eos> Along with Weyoun and Dukat.<eos> I'll have a voice in station policy.<eos> You sure this is a good idea?<eos> Dukat thought it was a terrible idea.<eos> You should have seen his face.<eos> But Weyoun is using you.
I won't.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me I have to get to work.<eos> I'll see you at the resistance meeting.<eos> Are you two ever going to be finished?<eos> Just a few more minutes, Commander.<eos> That's "Captain. "<eos> It's an old naval tradition.<eos> Whoever's in command of a ship, regardless of rank is referred to as "Captain. "<eos> You mean, if I had to take command I would be called "Captain," too?<eos> Cadet, by the time you took command there'd be nobody left to call you anything.
I'm trying to see how serious your death wish really is.<eos> I'm betting that it doesn't even exist just like I'm betting that you won't be able to sit back and let your friends start a war that could destroy the Alpha Quadrant.<eos> That's an awfully big bet.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Point seven AU.<eos> Can you lose them?<eos> I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. Very fancy.<eos> You can take over now. Hmm.<eos> No. I don't think so.<eos> Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles.
Why would he do that?<eos> So we'd think his plan was going to work.<eos> It's not.<eos> There was never going to be a duplicate Defiant...<eos> just one... and Yedrin wanted to make sure it went back in time.<eos> So that history would repeat itself.<eos> If I hadn't realized what he had done we would have ended up stranded here and Kira would have died.<eos> You betrayed us.<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> You call yourself Yedrin Dax but I don't recognize you.
Whatever Starfleet put in there is very well-hidden.<eos> - Ridiculous.<eos> - That's easy for you to say.<eos> You don't know them.<eos> They're desperate.<eos> You won't get any of us to believe that Starfleet Intelligence has implanted a neural transponder to monitor your thoughts.<eos> I would have if I were them.<eos> When I conducted interrogations for the Obsidian Order, I did a lot worse.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> They are not interrogating you, but debriefing.
Arcybite ore futures are continuing to increase and the Bolians have finally agreed to allow the Ferengi Gaming Commission to take over all their gambling emporiums.<eos> And... and...<eos> I have decided to allocate extra funds for research on a new breed of Hupyrian beetles.<eos> Those little fellows are going to revolutionize the entire beetle snuff industry.<eos> Now that's what I call a busy and productive day.<eos> No wonder the Ferengi economy is growing at a record pace.<eos> Costs are down, profits are up...<eos> And opportunity is around every corner.<eos> Zekkie, you've done quite a job.<eos> And your people love you for it... your business acumen, your negotiation skills your kindness and generosity.
The artery is not severed and I am not dead. Oh, well, forgive me for boring you.<eos> Let me get straight to the point. You're acting like a fool.<eos> Your observation is noted.<eos> But spending two years in a Dominion prison camp has dulled my reflexes. This only proves that I need further training.<eos> Turning off the holosuite safety protocols during a battle simulation is, at best, dubious.<eos> For a man with only one eye, it's positively idiotic.<eos> Now, if you would consider ocular replacement...<eos> I do not want an artificial eye!<eos> Then you must accept the fact that you have a disability and stop acting like...<eos> There are limits as to how far I will indulge you, Doctor.
Sir?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You're the only one here not wearing a garland.<eos> Given the decor, it seems somehow excessive.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> I think you're trying to isolate yourself and make a public protest at the same time.<eos> Explain.<eos> You didn't want to be here in the first place.<eos> Being the only one without a lei sets you apart from the others, allowing you to symbolically maintain your solitude.
The illusion of control.<eos> That's exactly right. Because no one can control the wind and the waves.<eos> But for a few moments, when you're on the water and the ride is perfect the feeling is that you can.<eos> Do you ever feel that?<eos> Never?<eos> Don't you have an imagination?<eos> If, by imagination, you mean the ability to spontaneously generate images within my mind, then, yes, I have a highly developed imagination as do all of my race.<eos> All right, imagine this... that you, with your logic and your reason, are skimming atop endless waves of emotion.<eos> You believe you're in control, but you know the control is an illusion.<eos> You believe that you understand the depths beneath you... but that, too, is an illusion.
You're in Sick Bay.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've seen you before.<eos> Do you know my name?<eos> The boy, he called you Dr. van Gogh.<eos> That's right.<eos> You said I was your finest friend.<eos> I'm not sure I've ever said that exactly, but... that doesn't mean it's not true.<eos> How could I be your friend? I don't know you.
I don't know about you, but when I think about spending 70 years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache.
You are to be returned to your ship where you will set course away from our territory.<eos> It would be in your best interest if I never saw you again.<eos> I'm not so good at chemistry.<eos> My career as a metallurgical scientist is likely to be... undistinguished.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was foolish.<eos> Arrogant... and I lost everything.<eos> You were courageous, as the Voth have always been from the first time they left Earth.<eos> And you, Chakotay, have been a colleague... a friend.<eos> I will not forget you.
I detected a tetryon surge coming from their ship.<eos> There are many possible sources of increased tetryon emissions. It may have been an irregularity in their warp field.<eos> No. It was their weapons.<eos> That whole "welcome to Nasari territory" was a trick.<eos> How could you know that?<eos> I can't explain that. I just knew.<eos> I was only trying to protect the ship.<eos> I trust your intentions, Ensign, but your actions are going to need a little more justification.<eos> I want you to analyze the sensor logs and see if there's any basis for Mr. Kim's hunch. Aye, Captain.<eos> In the meantime, I'm suspending you from duty.
That's not what I meant.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> It's you who don't seem to understand.<eos> I am beyond considerations of wrong and right.<eos> Behavioral categories are for the weak. For those of you without the will to define your existence. To do what they must-- no matter who might get harmed along the way.<eos> Let's move.<eos> I'm not going, Doctor.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> And you certainly are going.<eos> Why does it bother you so much when I call you Doctor?
Fortunately, my alter ego didn't do any... permanent harm.<eos> He certainly knew his way around a hypospray. I'll give him that. Good riddance.<eos> Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Kes. I'm ready to get to work on those analyses. I'm glad to hear it.<eos> I'm also pleased you've decided to remain on board.<eos> I would have had my hands full in Sick Bay without you.<eos> The Captain suggested that I consider all the consequences.<eos> If I am going through changes in my life, things that are unpredictable, this is the best place for me.<eos> Surrounded by those who know you... and... care for you.
I'm not going to leave you.<eos> It was a pleasure treating you. Don't hesitate to call again.<eos> Are you all right, Mr. Paris? Oh, just great.<eos> Maybe we can go to the Mess Hall now, and let the holographic Neelix burn my arm with a frying pan.<eos> Your feeble attempt at wit notwithstanding, it does appear that Seska has reprogrammed the holographic crew to torture us.<eos> I suggest we avoid meeting any more of them.<eos> Seska to Tuvok.<eos> I know you can hear me.<eos> Oh, terrific.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that wherever you go, I'll find you.
About being put on a table and having something implanted in me, then having my memory stolen, only to have it returned along with a disease I was given.<eos> Is that your justification?<eos> Is that what you'll tell the joint panel tonight?<eos> - Are you afraid of that?<eos> - Well, considering the dead man was murdered in cold blood and you wilfully misidentified him, yes, I am afraid.<eos> - But I'm only afraid for you.<eos> - You're gonna use that against me.<eos> You're gonna use me as I've been used all along, to preserve the lies.<eos> Where is Agent Mulder?<eos> Your silence won't save you.
The minute you learn something, I'd appreciate a call.<eos> Is this related to that other case?<eos> - If you don't mind my asking.<eos> - What other case?<eos> I got a call from an agent about six months ago, asking me about killer bees.<eos> - Who was it?<eos> - Name was Fox Mulder.<eos> I wondered if there's any connection.<eos> No.<eos> Anyway, I'II call you.
You never did.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> I saved her life once before when I had her returned to Agent Mulder.<eos> I may save her life again.<eos> But you'II never know if you pull the trigger, will you?<eos> Now, unless you intend to kill me, I'd Iike to answer my phone.<eos> Yes?<eos> He was just here.<eos> He threatened to kill me.<eos> I'm sure Mulder will be contacting you.
Thank God I caught you.<eos> I checked over the figures on those foreign bonds you bought, and as it turns out, you haven't made $43 million, you've lost it.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You know?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm the head of the Bond Department.<eos> - Talk to you from Boston.<eos> - Mr. Toomy, you can't go to Boston.<eos> All of these transactions were personally authorised by you.<eos> The board of directors will crucify you.
Listen to me.<eos> Listen...<eos> Whoa, a nose hold.<eos> I can break it.<eos> Easiest thing in the world, trust me.<eos> I said I could break it.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Signify if you understand.<eos> You listen to me,<eos> I haven't got time to discuss your business appointments, therefore I'm gonna send you to the cabin with this gentleman in the striped shirt.
The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.<eos> Okay, thanks a lot.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand... the way it works out here.<eos> You're all just our guests.<eos> But you act like you're at home.<eos> Let me tell you something, partner.<eos> You ain't home.<eos> But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.
The ayes have it.<eos> This hearing is adjourned.<eos> - You have to be kidding.<eos> - Adjourned? What do you mean?<eos> Senator, you promised me a hearing.<eos> You didn't even look at the fbi reports.<eos> When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?<eos> I was never your guest. Never my guest?<eos> I never comped you?<eos> I don't comp you at least three times a month?
No, it isn't.<eos> Days is conceivable.<eos> Weeks, maybe.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Months, no.<eos> Years, forget it.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - Dibs, check.<eos> Get the bouquet.<eos> Now, Dr. Harvey I will be watching you very closely.
- They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.<eos> John, this is Andy Cross.<eos> - This is Bill Jarvis. He's...<eos> - I'm, uh, with another agency.<eos> - It's good to meet you. - This is Lieutenant McClane and Mr Carver.<eos> We got a couple of questions first.<eos> No.<eos> - Mm-mm. - How about you?<eos> Did you recognise the voice on the phone?<eos> No. Have you noticed any cars following you, or...?
Rules of the game.<eos> Call Grierson, check it out.<eos> Change in the back.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Malibu Equity and Investments.<eos> Roger Van Zant.<eos> Please hold.<eos> This is Roger Van Zant.<eos> I'm supposed to collect something.<eos> Someone will call you back from another line.
What?<eos> As a patsy, to cover up his crimes.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Goddamn terrorists.<eos> Now they've joined the media.<eos> Why didn't you tell me sooner?<eos> I'm a reporter. I was hoping for a scoop.<eos> Don't be an idiot, Robinson.<eos> These people will eat you for breakfast.<eos> If they contact you again... please, let me know. Day or night.
- I grow nervous around people who do.<eos> - I'm really very happy to be here. Really. - Good.<eos> You'll drop by my office later on. I have a list of students you'll be advising.<eos> "Advising"?<eos> Can I ask when I'm supposed to be doing this advising?<eos> That's for you and the student to arrange.<eos> - You meet your orchestra when?<eos> - Fifth period.<eos> - Are they any good? - They try hard.<eos> And by the way, I'll need a complete lesson plan from you by Friday.
You can't compare his offense with that of a man who smuggled food to a lizard.<eos> Now, this was the first time a sentence of three years had been imposed?<eos> It wasn't a sentence.<eos> It was an administrative decision to place him there, uh for an undetermined amount of time.<eos> Why not a time limit? Doesn't that seem a little bit inhumane? No time limit.<eos> Put simply, no.<eos> While we strive to prevent crime what shall we do with the man who has committed it, hm?<eos> We aim to make him his better self.<eos> His better self.<eos> Well, I'm sure that Henri Young thanks you for his better self.
- Nice speech.<eos> Is always the same.<eos> OK.<eos> Just check that itinerary and move along.<eos> Is right here.<eos> That says "lnvitation only".<eos> You're a big donor to the campaign.<eos> Of course you're invited.<eos> They love you.<eos> Thall get you in anywhere.
Mrs. Nixon, do you think your son will ever return to politics?<eos> I don't think he has a choice. He has always been a leader.<eos> Do you think he'd make a great president, Mrs. Nixon?<eos> If he's on God's side, yes.<eos> You must be very proud of your son.<eos> I have always been proud of all of my children.<eos> Of course, no one can see into the future. We didn't know this day would come.<eos> I thought that guy was gonna kiss your hand.<eos> Jesus, Dick! I've never seen anything like it. Even the goddamn Times is saying you've got it.<eos> Vietnam's gonna put you in there, Chief.
I thought you'd rather do it now.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> Sir.<eos> May I say, sir, that if you stay now it will paralyze the nation and its foreign policy.<eos> You always had a great sense of timing, Henry.<eos> When to give and when to take.<eos> How do you think Mao and Brezhnev will react?<eos> Do you think they'll remember us, Henry after all the great things you and I did together as some kind of of crooks?<eos> They will understand. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.<eos> History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries. Yeah.
I doubt that a lying chicken-shit like you was even in the same state.<eos> How about that left hand, Ace?<eos> How about that left-handed draw?<eos> Mr. Ace Hanlon, scourge of the sagebrush.<eos> The terror of Tucson.<eos> A bladder full of hot air.<eos> Daddy!<eos> String him up! Put him on a chair.<eos> Daddy!<eos> They're calling for you on the street.
You might do it again.<eos> You're a man to watch.<eos> A word.<eos> We shall be the only two officers.<eos> We can't have enmity between us.<eos> Can we not?<eos> - It's hard to talk to you.<eos> - It's quite easy.<eos> Just start like this:<eos> "Major Sharpe, I believe you are ignorant and illegitimate and wounded all over, but I forgive you.
My nephew.<eos> You mean Rashid?<eos> Rashid? Is that what he told you his name was?<eos> Well, whatever his name is, he's not here any more.<eos> He left a couple of days ago.<eos> Why was he here in the first place?<eos> Why are you messing around with a black boy?<eos> Are you a pervert?<eos> Look, lady, that is enough.<eos> If you don't calm down I'm gonna throw you out of here.
Do we agree that as long as Americans demand drugs, they will be supplied?<eos> I don't want to be here longer than I have to.<eos> You mentioned a gang war.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - That we want the same thing.<eos> - Really?<eos> So far you've done all the work.<eos> You've taken care of the little fish.<eos> I will take care of the one that got away.<eos> Once Escobedo is gone, I will be in a position to help you.
You wait again for love to start, to feel the beating of the heart.<eos> Gnaghi!<eos> I had a terrible dream:<eos> I was in town and killed seven real people.<eos> Hey, remember me?<eos> Dellamorte!<eos> You've got important visitors!<eos> There comes a time when all is sad, when you're alone, it feels so bad.<eos> You see, Engineer, after this massacre the voters are furious.<eos> They've been voting for you for fifteen years.
Hi!<eos> God!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to frighten you.<eos> I was expecting someone else.<eos> Miss!<eos> Miss!<eos> Ever since I got to town, strange things have been happening to me.<eos> It's as if I've been here before. And that grave, and you, Mr. Dellamorte!<eos> It's as if I've known you forever.
Of course, this is all very hush-hush.<eos> Well, sir, let me say I think you'd be a wonderful asset to the president.<eos> Your broad outlook would appeal to psychotic liberals as well as militant fascists.<eos> Something for everyone.<eos> Don't mind telling you this would be a crowning jewel in a lifetime of foreign service.<eos> - Naturally.<eos> - Closing the deal, however... will take considerable effort on my part.<eos> You know how it is. The right dinner parties. Golf course.<eos> Naturally, my presence in Washington will be essential.<eos> Sir, I understand, and I won't let you down.
I called the Kleins. They're gonna take care of Seth till we get back.<eos> The Kleins?<eos> You couldn't pick a worse couple.<eos> - Why?<eos> What's wrong with the Kleins?<eos> - They have orgies.<eos> - How do you know? - I catered one. Terrible.<eos> These are terrible.<eos> Hey, Ma, Dad, guess who I found upstairs.<eos> Father Drobney, what brings you down here?
I was a deprived child. I told you.<eos> - Give me... - Oh, wonderful. Now he takes one.<eos> Are you sure it's safe to go out there?<eos> Mrs. Hollander, I assure you, it's been carefully coordinated.<eos> Mr. Krojack will be with you till the moment you board the plane.<eos> Did you take your hair dryer our of Mr. Burns' office?<eos> Did you hurt yourself? We came to say good-bye and to wish you good luck.<eos> - It's a pity you're leaving.<eos> - Well, look, if you ever need a job... I know a lot of people in New Jersey who'd appreciate your kind of cooking.<eos> And don't worry about the Board of Health, 'cause they'll never catch you.
Mm. ...tie it together again. - He's a priest.<eos> Magic is not his full-time job. - I have to go. I'm sorry.<eos> - But he said he was gonna put it together.<eos> - Well, Mr. Magee, thank you so much.<eos> - Thank you very much. - A lovely, lovely evening.<eos> - Very, very nice party. Here.<eos> - Yes, we'll be going. - Oh, yes. Nice to have chatted with you.<eos> - Come on, Carmen.<eos> Yes, well, um... - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to have met you. And maybe, maybe I'll see you in Newark sometime.
And this morning a devout priest produced... a seven of spades behind my left ear.<eos> - He's been working on that.<eos> - He was having a hard time...<eos> - Come in!<eos> - "The flight went well."<eos> - Flight? - "Yes, it did, Orville. I was surprised."<eos> "Me too, Wilbur."<eos> "Well, I shouldn't say surprised, but encouraged."<eos> "Me too." "Now, you mark my words, we'll show the world."<eos> I'll get you for this, Axel.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.<eos> I met him recently and he really wants to be in our movie.<eos> Why would Lugosi want to do a sex change flick?<eos> Because he's my friend!<eos> All right, fine! You can direct it.<eos> I want a script in three days.<eos> We start shooting a week from Monday.<eos> Oh, Mr Weiss, thank you so much.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> I won't let you down.
I know where he is.<eos> You look like the kind of a man who can recognize a great opportunity when he sees one.<eos> Now, by investing in a Darkside Tour franchise, you can turn death into dollars.<eos> I can personally almost guarantee you a 45% annual return.<eos> How about you guarantee you pay for that last round?<eos> Frank, I am entertaining a client.<eos> Sir, by being a partial franchisee, you can own 5% for a mere $600.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> Your family will thank you.
I'll see your 1 0 and I'll raise you 1 0.<eos> -What do you got?<eos> -Full house.<eos> That beats me.<eos> Damn.<eos> You are a lucky lady.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> It is now.<eos> My name is Annabelle Bransford.<eos> What do they call you?
Now then, why don't you--<eos> o.k., pops, come on.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> Give me the whip.<eos> What have you been drinking?<eos> Just something to keep me warm.<eos> You are intoxicated, sir.<eos> And you're a pain in the butt.<eos> You are a disgrace.<eos> You have any idea how many children are watching you?
Sorry about this, Jerry?<eos> Well, we've... come to pick Nell up<eos> Yeah, I heard<eos> I've got the court order<eos> You do know it's in her own best interests right?<eos> Did you ask her?<eos> Well, you know that's impossible<eos> Tell 'em, Don<eos> Well, I have a court order here that says... if you don't get Nell's informed consent, you're violating' her rights<eos> And if you do that, I'm gonna sue you all the way to the Supreme Court
Stupid chicks.<eos> This coffee's a ruin.<eos> Where we're from you'd be called bigmouths.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hold it, it's seventy six marks.<eos> There is seventy here.<eos> There.<eos> Thanks for the earrings.<eos> I'll never forget you for this.
- I want...<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I want my vacation.<eos> - What's that?<eos> I wait three years.<eos> Three years. Then you Americans come.<eos> Talinsky, he assign me to you.<eos> Now I can't go.<eos> I have plan.<eos> Connors, I don't leave you... without anyone.
I'll take your advise and keep quiet.<eos> Or simpler still, she never left.<eos> Maybe she stayed with you to keep your company? But in this case, where was she when my men arrested you?<eos> Why were you running so out of breath you couldn't talk?<eos> I'll take your advise and keep quiet.<eos> 93633396, is that your ex-second wife's number?<eos> You expressly asked to call that number! Then you implied the victim could be a man! To cover your ass.<eos> Is the victim the woman whose number is 93633396?<eos> If it's not her, how many potential victims does a man have, a man of renown, a recluse, whom no one has seen for several years?<eos> How many know you well enough to know where to find you, here, in the middle of nowhere, where even you say you seldom come?
You tell him that he promised that he would call me back, and if he doesn't, something is going to happen.<eos> - Do you understand that ?<eos> That's right. Okay, bye.<eos> You just tell Mr. Enright that if he doesn't want to talk to me, maybe the district attorney would like to talk to me. - lf he wants to play hardball, I'll play hardball.<eos> [ Barry ] And returning with $83,000, our champion, after seven weeks, Charles Van Doren.<eos> It was a totally humiliating experience.<eos> All my friends knew that I loved Marty. It's one of my favorite films.<eos> l-l-l saw it three times.<eos> It's about a boy in the Bronx--<eos> Mr. Enright will see you now.
You must have done very well at Harvard.<eos> Clark doesn't like anyone.<eos> Uh, I was, uh, actually first in my class.<eos> - You make it sound like an affliction.<eos> Did you clerk ? - Well--<eos> - Uh, Frankfurter.<eos> - Oh, really ? Hmm. It's nothin'.<eos> I tell you, what I love is what you do, literature.<eos> Well, hell, if I was first in my class, I'd get a tattoo.<eos> - So, what brings you to New York, Dick, uh, literature ?
Talk English like a Christian<eos> Madam, I'm Colonel Beauchamp.<eos> I have the honor to know your husband Colonel Dubreton.<eos> He sends you his love.<eos> I trust my husband is well, Colonel.<eos> He worries a lot about you, madam.<eos> And you?<eos> I am withering in my bloom, lost in solitary gloom, Colonel Beauchamp.<eos> Solitary gloom<eos> No wonder your husband loves you so much, madam.
Who's your best shot?<eos> Taylor, sir.<eos> Right, Taylor...<eos> A shilling says you can't beat even a raw recruit to the Chosen Men.<eos> Perkins, give me your hat.<eos> Right, Taylor.<eos> Make ready<eos> Well, would you believe it?<eos> Perkins put his bullet straight through the same hole made by Taylor.<eos> Tell me, Frederickson... what do the lads really call you?
Stand back.<eos> Hand me your sword, Major Sharpe.<eos> Major Sharpe, you are charged with the murder of the Marqués de Casares el Grande.<eos> I've been sleeping all night.<eos> How did he die?<eos> Throat slit from ear to ear as he slept<eos> I didn't kill him<eos> I swear, sir, on my honor.<eos> You're under arrest, Major Sharpe.<eos> If I don't get you under lock and key the Spanish will hang you.
I'm not sure.<eos> I was confused... drunk.<eos> I think... mostly I wanted to scare them.<eos> When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.<eos> No, I was sobering up.<eos> I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.<eos> Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.<eos> I've been very clear on this point.<eos> I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning... and finds your wife in bed with her lover... riddled with .38-caliber bullets.<eos> Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
No.<eos> This was revenge... of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature.<eos> Four bullets per victim.<eos> Not six shots fired, but eight.<eos> That means that he fired the gun empty... and then stopped to reload... so that he could shoot each of them again.<eos> An extra bullet per lover... right in the head.<eos> You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.<eos> It chills my blood just to look at you.<eos> By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...<eos> I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back... one for each of your victims.
Why?<eos> - You're safe here on the Enterprise.<eos> - No, I have to go back.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Let me go back. Let me go back!<eos> Let me go back.<eos> Please!<eos> - What was he talking about?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Can I help you?
Nice try.<eos> There was a time when I wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> Then the Borg came.<eos> They showed me that there is one constant in this universe... death.<eos> We're all going to die sometime.<eos> It's just a question of how and when.<eos> You will too, Captain.<eos> Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you?<eos> Like a predator, it's stalking you.<eos> You can try and outrun it with doctors, medicines, new technologies, but time will hunt you down and make the kill.
- She isn't real either, is she?<eos> Nothing here is.<eos> Nothing here matters.<eos> Maybe this is more about that empty chair on the bridge of the Enterprise.<eos> Ever since I left Starfleet I haven't made a difference.<eos> Captain of the Enterprise?<eos> Close to retirement?<eos> - I'm not planning on it.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Don't let them promote or transfer you. Don't let them do anything that takes you off that ship.
We have to get to the Devron system.<eos> I am sorry. My first duty is to the Empire.<eos> I must adhere to regulations.<eos> I know that I am an old man and I am out of touch, but the Worf that I remember was more concerned with honour and loyalty than rules and regulations.<eos> But that was a long time ago.<eos> Maybe you're not the Worf I knew.<eos> You have always used your knowledge of Klingon honour to get what you want from me.<eos> Because it always works, Worf!<eos> Your problem is that you really do have a sense of honour and you do care about trust and loyalty.<eos> Don't blame me for knowing you so well.
If your weapons are not at full battle-readiness, penalties will be severe.<eos> Those guys'll be happy to see us.<eos> Well, if it isn't our little buddies who double-crossed us! - What did he say?<eos> - Hell, these guys are fanatics.<eos> I think he said he could lead us outside.<eos> What I said was... we're on the same side!<eos> I spent the past ten years working in the media world, using it to gather intelligence on you.<eos> I found partners who hated you and your friends... as much as I did.<eos> But most importantly, I studied the martial arts of three continents.<eos> So that one day... I could meet you, avenge my father...
I went up once.<eos> Nearly blinded me.<eos> Hurried as fast as I could back down where it's dark and decent. Oh.<eos> - I love the light.<eos> - I hate it.<eos> End of story.<eos> Story.<eos> Thumbelina, tell Mr. Mole a story.<eos> A lovely, sad story.<eos> - Stand right there, where I can see you.
Ah, young Senator McComb.<eos> Why not? Oh, you'll like him, George.<eos> Very much like you, except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.<eos> There's never enough time.<eos> Never enough for what?<eos> To satisfy a woman.<eos> Then you never want to miss an opportunity.<eos> Are you busy?<eos> I'm meeting my husband.<eos> If I were him, I would not keep you waiting.
Let's take this girl for our second brother.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Go and help her.<eos> - You go.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Good, Wing Chun is here.<eos> Mr. Yim, stop your daughter.<eos> - She embarrasses us men.<eos> - I've been tolerating you for long enough.
I am mister Klamm's mistress.<eos> Mistress?<eos> Then you are important person for me.<eos> Not just for you.<eos> Before this I was a cattle-tender.<eos> With such delicate hands?<eos> Then nobody paid attention to them.<eos> Frieda... you amaze me, and what willpower must one have to become barmaid from simple cattle-tender.<eos> Of course, you won't be openhearted to a man whom you don't know at all, who doesn't even have an opportunity to tell about himself...<eos> I know everything about you, you're land surveyor.
There's Klamm's signature, indeed.<eos> What are you saying!<eos> Yes.<eos> That's personal letter what results from address "honourable mister".<eos> Moreover, there's no word about you being hired as land surveyor.<eos> It talks about being in count's sevice in general. So that... so that it is anything but clear here.<eos> Except me being simply thrown out!<eos> You don't say so!<eos> Your case is too complicated. You are just promised hopsitable welcome.<eos> Nobody is throwing you out, but, at the same time, nobody is holding you.
I am Momus, Klamm's village secretary.<eos> I'd like to hear answers to certain questions of interest to us.<eos> What does it mean, mister Klamm's representative for the village?<eos> Mister Momus is mister Klamm's representative, but his position is only limited to the village.<eos> He receives files from the village meant for mister Klamm.<eos> Mister Momus holds very important post.<eos> Nice.<eos> I congratulate you.<eos> But now it's time for me to go home.<eos> Sure, duty of school caretaker is calling you, but will have to sit here a minute, just two or three questions.
Hey!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Mister Vallabne, I am Amalia. The same girl with ruby bead you fell in love with three years ago when you saw me through carriage window.<eos> All these years I was looking forward to see you to tell you that I agree to all the things you asked for in that letter.<eos> You have mixed up something, but you will be present at dinner.<eos> Ehy!<eos> And who are you?<eos> Me?<eos> I am Brunsvick.<eos> He doesn't know you.
Yes indeed, I went to one of his concerts... and truly, I felt... sorry.<eos> I confesses to him that I played and composed by ear; but well, many inspired popular composers cannot write music.<eos> At least they can write their name!<eos> As I was singing my songs to him I realized that the professor was becoming visibly touched; I even believe I saw two tears trying to escape his eyes.<eos> Well, er, tears escape, no... lt was I who wanted to escape!<eos> Finally I asked him: professor, what do you think of me as a singer and songwriter?<eos> ... and he firmly advised me to keep on singing.<eos> Ah, yes, I said to him: you must sing...<eos> where nobody hears you.<eos> You must sing for yourself; because, more than as a songwriter, I see you as a "selfwriter."
Why?<eos> Because I think you're right.<eos> I mean, I also think Vic is a complete degenerate, but...<eos> - This is freedom of speech.<eos> - You could get suspended.<eos> So.<eos> Miss Chase.<eos> May I speak with you?<eos> - Want a copy of the Liberty Lit? - Maybe later.<eos> Right now Mr. Foster would like to see you in his office.
- l'll be right back.<eos> - l'll go with you.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> I wonder what Commander Sisko wanted?<eos> It can wait.<eos> - This is very embarrassing.<eos> - We have to stop.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Doctor...<eos> Commander Sisko needs to see you in the Wardroom.
- We can't.<eos> - They're sore losers.<eos> - You can't quit now!<eos> You just won...<eos> Female!<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> I thought this was Lieutenant Dax's quarters.<eos> She's in the shower.<eos> Well, in that case... ls she expecting you?
Maybe one of them can help us to find out what's going on here.<eos> I haven't thought about Elemspur for a long time.<eos> Tell us about your fellow prisoners.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Wait. I remember you.<eos> You were there, too.<eos> Kiri something?<eos> Kira.<eos> Kira Nerys.<eos> I almost didn't recognise you.
Yes.<eos> Garak has been lecturing me on surveillance. I'll try it.<eos> - Sisko to Kira.<eos> - This is Kira.<eos> We received word that Vedek Bareil is coming aboard the station.<eos> When?<eos> His ship just arrived at docking bay 12.<eos> If you'd given us notice we could have arranged a reception.<eos> That's what I wanted to avoid.<eos> What brings you here?
I hope Jake and Nog stay out of sight until help gets here.<eos> Nog's not a fool.<eos> He'll find a hole and climb in.<eos> I'm not so sure about Jake.<eos> If I know him, he'll be looking for us.<eos> Did you learn how to neutralise security fields in Starfleet?<eos> I've never seen anything like this before.<eos> - lt seems to...<eos> - Don't.<eos> The security barrier will kill you.
We must talk in private.<eos> Yes?<eos> - l want you to find Jake.<eos> - ls he missing?<eos> - Let me know where he is.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - How did you get in here?<eos> - l was an unregistered passenger on a Kotakian ship this morning.<eos> I slipped in through the cargo bay.<eos> And made your way here without anyone seeing you.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to refuse that order.<eos> Please, Commander don't make us send the Jem'Hadar after you.<eos> Go right ahead, but you better warn them not to expect any reinforcements for about 70 years.<eos> Attack pattern theta, Mr. O'Brien.<eos> Hard a-port.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Step back, Major.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Commander.<eos> They can't hear you.
- And now it's breaking down.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> - Why don't you shut it off?<eos> - lt's too late now.<eos> My body has become dependent on the higher endorphin levels it generates.<eos> So, that's it then.<eos> - You're going let them win.<eos> - "Them", Doctor?<eos> The Central Command, the Obsidians - whoever it is who exiled you here.<eos> You're going to let them destroy you, give up hope of seeing Cardassia again.
And so I let them go.<eos> I gave them whatever latinum I had in my pockets and opened the door and flung them back into the streets.<eos> Elim couldn't believe his eyes.<eos> He looked at me as if I were insane.<eos> You took pity on those children.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> No!<eos> I was a fool!<eos> I should have completed my interrogation and turned them over for execution. But because I was chilly and hungry, I failed in my duty and destroyed everything I had worked for.<eos> - And so they exiled you.
Look, we're not after the Maquis.<eos> We're just trying to help an innocent man.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> People saw you talking to O'Brien just before he left.<eos> Since when is that a crime?<eos> We're old friends from the Rutledge.<eos> Doesn't it bother you that an old friend will be executed?<eos> Of course it does. I wish I could help.<eos> He has a wife and a five-year-old daughter.<eos> I can assure you that we won't turn you over to the Cardassians.
That will take hours.<eos> We'll just have to hope the simulation holds.<eos> Let's try it.<eos> Mr La Forge, monitor this situation carefully.<eos> Keep a commlink with the holodeck so as to be apprised of problems.<eos> I'll return as soon as my surgical alterations are completed and prepare the Boraalans for their journey.<eos> I don't think it's wise to leave you alone with those people.<eos> Mr Worf will accompany you.<eos> Sir, someone else would be better. Counsellor Troi is familiar...<eos> The Boraalans know you.
His ship was destroyed. He'll use our shuttle.<eos> If stopped, I will claim to have stolen it.<eos> We distressed the shuttle as if it had been fired upon.<eos> Joret will talk his way past the patrol.<eos> If I were alone, my chances of succeeding would be slim.<eos> But if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be a bounty hunter.<eos> Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon.<eos> For a price, the patrol will look the other way.<eos> Once the shuttle is past the patrol,<eos> Joret will put you into an escape pod and return you.
Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital.<eos> He's suffering from exposure.<eos> When he's been checked out, I'm going to question him.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> - I thought it was over.<eos> - Over?<eos> Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe Goodensnake's body?<eos> You thought it would all end when he was cremated?<eos> What were you afraid we'd find?<eos> I can't tell you, but I'll take you to somebody who can.
- It's possible to alter somebody's dreams?<eos> - In theory, yes.<eos> I paid off your cab.<eos> - I don't like being ditched like a bad date.<eos> - Sorry if I hurt your feelings.<eos> What's with this attitude?<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know, back at the academy...<eos> some of the guys used to make fun of you.
- Agent Mulder?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Agent Mulder, get your things.<eos> You're in some trouble.<eos> These are serious allegations. The evidence is incriminating.<eos> A good forensic scientist would know there is not only a shoe print... ..but an impact point of the foot from inside the shoe.<eos> An analysis of Tooms's injury would show... ..my foot was not inside the shoe.<eos> Are you suggesting Tooms is framing you?
We were talking about you when you were in the academy.<eos> Most of us, including the director, feel you are wasted on the X-Files.<eos> But we respect that you are deeply invested in those areas.<eos> But if these cases are creating such stress... ..as to cause not only you to act inappropriately... ..but agents close to you,... ..then may I advise you to step away... ..for a while?<eos> Clear your head, take an extended vacation.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Thanks for your concern.<eos> You're forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.<eos> Mulder,... ..this was close.<eos> Any closer and 1,000 friends at the Capitol won't be able to help you.
Okay.<eos> You're hired.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What's the salary?<eos> We'll talk about it later.<eos> Mail's here!<eos> For who?<eos> Cheng Lam.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Mr. Wong, Attorney Fong is ready to see you.
Why not?<eos> I brought all his documents this time!<eos> Just go find somebody and sign it!<eos> I've explained to you many times already.<eos> This is illegal.<eos> Please help, I need to sell the shop urgently!<eos> Just tell me... how much do you want?<eos> Tell me!<eos> It's not a matter of money.<eos> If you can't get Mr. Lam here I can't help you.
- Have some wine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Got all the covers.<eos> - Put them inside. Near the front.<eos> I'm dying!<eos> My sweet God in Heaven, the pain!<eos> - I'm in so much pain.<eos> - It must be terrible.<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> God will take care of you.
It's a location transmitter.<eos> See?<eos> It should dissolve in about five years.<eos> But, until then, Ambassador my friends, in my warrior caste, have this frequency.<eos> If anything should happen to Babylon 5 they have instructions to track down that transmitter and well, why spoil the surprise?<eos> This is an outrage.<eos> This is insurance.<eos> What you do here is your own business.<eos> You can scheme, plan and play the games you want, but get this straight:<eos> If you ever endanger this station again, my people will find you.
I'm Peter, Byron's father.<eos> I want to thank you.<eos> You have a brave son.<eos> I made my dad bring me.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Why do you want to be with him?<eos> I feel safe with him.<eos> Many people are safe due to you.<eos> They call you the Good Samaritan.
Wonderful. I'm Daniel, personal assistant.<eos> - Yes. - Asleep. - You-<eos> - Dustin Hoffman. - Me play Dustin Hoffman?<eos> He wants you to play Dustin Hoffman, sleeping.<eos> He means, sit down here and sleep.<eos> So the guards cannot see the monitors. It's logical. One sleeps, the other looks for his lenses.<eos> Because the murderer comes through the door. The murderer, the murderers come in through this door.<eos> Sure. It's great that you're here.<eos> Right. I'm looking for the contact lenses.<eos> You look down there... and I'll be filming you.
Polly Chalmers, my boss, sent it over.<eos> Go ahead. Take him.<eos> - I'm scared I'll drop it again.<eos> - You won't drop it.<eos> Come, Mrs. Cobb.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Listen.<eos> Sometimes I think I can hear the tiniest laugh.<eos> I like you, Netitia.<eos> I won't yell at you, like George did.
Come on, bitch.<eos> Come for me, if you're coming.<eos> Wilma.<eos> There's nothing quite so invigorating as a crisp fall day in New England.<eos> - Don't you agree?<eos> - Mr. Gaunt...<eos> Leland.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't even think.<eos> Believe me, Polly, I know you're in pain, so I shall dispense with the small talk.<eos> I'll give you the item I called you about and send you home.
I may know who killed them.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Garcia.<eos> That's not your real name.<eos> I think I saw something at the office I wasn 't supposed to see.<eos> Do you have a copy?<eos> I need to think about this.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - I'm not thinking rationally.<eos> Listen, I promise you I will protect you as a confidential source.
Tell me where you want to meet and I'll come with 3 agents.<eos> I thought the FBI was not involved.<eos> It's not involved, not yet.<eos> I have friends.<eos> We'll get you out of the city tonight, in Washington tomorrow.<eos> I promise you'll meet Voyles.<eos> We'll go from there.<eos> At noon tomorrow, take the trolley to Riverwalk.<eos> Wear a long sleeve shirt and a red baseball cap.<eos> Wait on the riverside at the bandstand and I'll find you.
I also checked Verheek.<eos> According to the fbi they found his body 2 days ago in a hotel room early in the morning.<eos> He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.<eos> That can't be.<eos> Want to talk about the brief?<eos> Everyone I've told about the brief is dead.<eos> I'll take my chances.<eos> You can't, under any circumstances, use my name or reveal how you got the information.<eos> Or publish anything until I've left the country.<eos> Unless I can convince you otherwise.
We're dead, you stupid slag!<eos> Don't count on it, chum.<eos> Kanemitsu-san, I... I realize that it looks bad, but maybe our plans were over ambitious.<eos> Let's start a sukoshi bit smaller.<eos> Let's gentrify this neighborhood, build strip malls, fast food chains, lots of popular entertainment.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said you're fired.<eos> Well, I got to hand it to you.<eos> What do they call you?
I don't see why... Who says I don't know any children?<eos> -Warnie.<eos> My brother was a child once, Rupert.<eos> And, as unlikely as it may seem, so was I.<eos> It's Thursday tomorrow, Jack.<eos> The week's almost gone and I haven't done half my letters. You don't have to write back...<eos> Don't have to write back, I know.<eos> It only encourages them.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> "Mr. C.S. Lewis thanks you for your letter, "but has nothing whatsoever to say in reply."
Major Lewis.<eos> Now, please, sit down.<eos> So you managed to find us.<eos> Yes, I used the guide, and so, you see...<eos> It's just that you don't look at all like C.S.Lewis.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, not to mention the rest of Oxford.<eos> Well, so you don't like that?<eos> Well, I'm not what you might call a public figure, Mrs. Gresham.<eos> Oh, you're not?<eos> I mean, you write all these books, and you give all those talks, and everything just so everybody will leave you alone?
Mr. Lewis.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Come and meet the college president.<eos> This is the college president.<eos> Where on Earth did he find her?<eos> She wrote to him.<eos> A pen-pal?<eos> Is this your first trip to England, Mrs. Gresham?<eos> Yeah, it's my first. But I was wanting to come for a long time.<eos> What brings you to England, Mrs. Gresham?
- You want to make me sergeant, sir?<eos> - Get a needle and thread.<eos> I need a sergeant by dawn.<eos> I'll never make a proper sergeant, sir.<eos> So?<eos> I'll never make a proper officer.<eos> Indeed you will, sir.<eos> You'll make a grand... killing officer<eos> Killing officer?<eos> God love you, sir.
- Do you?<eos> - You're a lunatic!<eos> Picking up that dreck off the street.<eos> Are you suicidal?<eos> Do you have AIDS?<eos> Are you infected?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> It's a miracle, but I don't.<eos> Do you feel I betrayed you?<eos> If you do, I will hang up and never bother you again.
Everything is fine.<eos> You are in good spirits.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Hello, it's Antoine.<eos> It is for you.<eos> Hello?<eos> My name is Antoine. - You don't know me...<eos> - No I don't. Excuse me.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Some boy. He has been looking for you.
My betrothed.<eos> You are here?<eos> Frenegonde!<eos> My beautiful Frenegonde!<eos> stop! That totally hurts!<eos> Calm down, you brute!<eos> It is I.<eos> stop.<eos> I don't know you. Frenegonde.<eos> The Countess doesn't know you.
Jacquart is calling me "Frenegonde" too.<eos> You slept with her? Don't worry.<eos> He looks weird but he's pals With Montmirail the stuntman.<eos> Montmirail the stuntman?<eos> You must mean Hubert, the race car driver.<eos> stuntman, wrestler... race car driver... same diff.<eos> But who are you?<eos> Jacquasse The Crass.<eos> You don't recognizeth me?<eos> No, I don't recognizeth you.
The height of fashion for auto-flaggelating creeps and crimson saints alike ... I can assure you!<eos> I tell you I'l never complain about London again.<eos> Theresa. ... your friend from the land before time.'<eos> No, not tonight<eos> I'm not crossing in this weather<eos> A deal?<eos> What's the hurry?<eos> That island has been there a very long time. .. and it ain't going to disappear now...<eos> I'll tell you what go to that dump across the road.<eos> ... hire yourself a room and next week I'll take you to the island.
- My mother.<eos> She came from this island.<eos> Is she living in London now?<eos> She died giving birth to me.<eos> - Sorry, didn't mean to...<eos> - Don't worry, it's not your fault.<eos> I'm sorry, truly..<eos> That the only photo I have of her<eos> My father spent his whole life trying to forget about this island.. ... and my mother.<eos> Mother Superior will see you in half an hour.
Dig around.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> If you're sure it's no trouble.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You're Indy.<eos> - You're Kate.<eos> - What's left of her.<eos> Oh, God, would you look at this place?<eos> Maybe I could help you clean it up? Yeah.<eos> Oh, Miss Peabody, a young man was here earlier looking for you.
- Answer the question!<eos> - My, you are a strutting little egotist.<eos> You forget the brilliance of Marritza's filing system.<eos> He made sure that I had information on all your little terrorist bands.<eos> What I particularly enjoyed were the termination reports.<eos> Yes, life in a labour camp can be so isolating.<eos> At times, I felt that I alone bore the burden of cleansing Bajor of its rabble. But those reports reassured me, I was not alone.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you remembered me from some report you read years ago?<eos> At the risk of bruising your vanity, Major, I didn't remember you until I heard your name here.<eos> - l can see that disturbs you.
I had no other ambition but to grow the planet's loveliest Felaran bromeliads.<eos> Unfortunately, the Prophets did not allow me that peaceful life.<eos> I understand my friend Vedek Winn has brought her blessings to your station.<eos> I hoped you could arrange an audience with the Assembly so I could discuss our school.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - You're tipped to become the next Kai.<eos> Your ideology differs from Vedek Winn's.<eos> You have been correctly informed.<eos> I'm sorry, Commander.<eos> The Vedek Assembly will not see you.

- What will be over soon?<eos> - Release me at once!<eos> - Enough of your whining!<eos> - What do these people want?<eos> - I was about to ask you that.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Tell me what you want here.<eos> Dax.<eos> I want Dax.<eos> She's not going anywhere with you.
What's that?<eos> A delta wave inducer to keep you asleep.<eos> It increases endorphin production to help the healing process.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - I recommend you use it.<eos> - The surgery will be easier...<eos> - I don't want your advice.<eos> I want to be awake.<eos> Use a neuroelectrical suppresser and set up a monitor so that I can watch the procedure.<eos> If you run into any trouble, I can assist you.
- l'm still as kind as ever.<eos> - l can pay you.<eos> My husband had a strongbox in our shop on the station. Bring it to me.<eos> - What's in it?<eos> - Nothing anyone would value.<eos> - Except you.<eos> - Sentimental reasons.<eos> Why not take a sentimental journey back to the station?<eos> I couldn't stand being in the shop where my husband was murdered.<eos> Maybe you'd rather not let Odo see you there.
- Are you here to arrest him?<eos> - No.<eos> Then you've found him.<eos> Quark, at your service.<eos> First drink on the house.<eos> An old Cardassian tradition.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> - A soft drink, then.<eos> - l don't drink.<eos> That's why we don't see you around here much.
Thanks.<eos> Why don't you start telling the truth?<eos> Whose side are you going to be on?<eos> - l'm not going to play your game.<eos> - You'll have to choose.<eos> That's why I was given this job, why you come to me with problems.<eos> I'm the outsider.<eos> All I'm interested in is justice.<eos> If you're innocent, you'll go free.<eos> If not, I'll turn you over to Cardassian authorities.
It's a Cardassian technique designed to keep you alive.<eos> I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.<eos> I have a few questions for you.<eos> Commander Sisko hasn't decided whether to grant you asylum yet, Tahna.<eos> - Perhaps I should conduct this alone.<eos> I'm the liaison officer to the Federation here.<eos> Still fighting for Bajor in my own way.<eos> I'll stop by later.<eos> - What do you need to know, Commander?<eos> - Why were they chasing you?
That cupboard right over there.<eos> You look real good, even from this angle.<eos> But you know something?<eos> You walk like a carnivorous rastipod.<eos> Now, look...<eos> You're trying to make me mad.<eos> - How am I doing?<eos> - Not well enough to get rid of me.<eos> Damn!<eos> - What do they call you?
Now, give it to me.<eos> Bidding starts at 200 bars of gold latinum.<eos> I can't decide what's more intoxicating - this Gamzian wine, or your negotiating skills.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> The lady and I are having a private conversation.<eos> It can wait.<eos> Tell me, Commander, where is that doctor of yours?<eos> He was supposed to meet me here earlier.<eos> - Tell me about Q. - l'll tell you anything you want to know.<eos> Just answer one question - is Starfleet penalising you or did you actually request such a dismal command?
Good morning, Chief.<eos> is this maintenance or repair?<eos> Right now it's maintenance, but it'll be repair when I'm through.<eos> If everything worked, you'd be miserable.<eos> You may be right, sir, but I'd be willing to give it a try.<eos> Good morning, Major.<eos> Computer, one Chiraltan tea with a double twist of lemon.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> If something's bothering you, I want to hear it.
Prepare to transport.<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Energising.<eos> Well?<eos> Looks like the transporter is down, too.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> We'll get it repaired right away.<eos> Dax to Chief O'Brien.<eos> Please report to Ops immediately.<eos> Odo, we'll get you out of there soon.
And now it is enough.<eos> They still need you.<eos> But I am not the man that they think I am.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> But Bajor doesn't need a man.<eos> It needs a symbol and that's what you are.<eos> No one's asking you to kill a hundred Cardassians with your bare hands.<eos> I saw you in front of the crowd on the Promenade.<eos> They look at you and they see strength and honour and decency.<eos> They look at you and see the best in themselves.
Alive, he seals our victory.<eos> Understood.<eos> Once you have him, Li will see the wisdom of supporting you.<eos> I'll offer him anything he wants, short of becoming the next Kai, of course.<eos> You have a unique ability to build a consensus, Essa.<eos> Bajor has been waiting for a leader like you.<eos> Leaders like us.<eos> If I am so favoured by the Vedek Assembly.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> 26 hours after I'm sworn into office, I'll direct the Vedek Assembly to elect you Kai.
We'll have trouble getting him past the Miradorn.<eos> I know.<eos> Ah-Kel screens every ship leaving this station.<eos> How soon can you be ready?<eos> I'm ready now.<eos> There's a Rigelian freighter leaving here in an hour.<eos> They can run interference between you and the Miradorn ship.<eos> I'll move the prisoner to the runabout now.<eos> Constable, once you're on the other side, you'll be on your own.<eos> The Miradorn vessel can outrun any of our runabouts and if they come after you, a warning from us will just point you out.
Computer, lights.<eos> Computer, turn on the lights.<eos> Space, the final frontier.<eos> These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.<eos> Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ... to seek out new life and new civilisations... ... to boldly go where no one has gone before.<eos> Good, you're awake.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Please, Counsellor.<eos> There is little time.<eos> The Commander will be calling for you.
- Yes, Commander.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 46519. 1.<eos> We are at Research Station 75 to take on a rather unique passenger, one whose homecoming will undoubtedly be difficult.<eos> The man is a dishonourable traitor.<eos> He risked his life to get here on a scout ship.<eos> That does not excuse his actions.<eos> Maybe he finally realised he made a mistake.<eos> It's 20 years too late.<eos> Energise.<eos> Ensign DeSeve, by order of Starfleet Command I arrest you for treason.
- This is not appropriate behaviour.<eos> - With all due respect, I have always voiced my opinions, even when they differ from Capt Picard's.<eos> But in those situations, you were Head of Security, not First Officer.<eos> The second-in-command carries out the decisions of the captain, in this case, me.<eos> But is it not my duty to offer you alternatives?<eos> But once I have made a decision, you must carry it out regardless of how you feel.<eos> Any objections should be given to me in private.<eos> I do not recall Cmdr Riker ever publicly showing irritation, as you just did.<eos> No, sir.<eos> If you cannot carry out this role, I will assign it to La Forge and return you to Tactical, recording it not as a reprimand, but as a transfer.
What's keeping them?<eos> You're just in time.<eos> They're about to disembark.<eos> Ambassadors Loquel, Byleth.<eos> I'm Capt Picard.<eos> - Welcome to the Enterprise.<eos> - It's a pleasure to be here.<eos> It is an honour to host the first cultural exchange between our peoples.<eos> The next seven days should prove illuminating.<eos> Let me introduce Voval. He will be taking you to our homeworld.
Where on board could you generate such a pulse?<eos> It could be initiated from the lateral sensor array, science labs one, four and 16, or the bridge science stations.<eos> Let's assume someone did send out a phased ionic pulse. What would have happened inside the shuttle?<eos> A tetryon field would be formed in the cabin, disrupting the metaphasic shield.<eos> A tetryon field?<eos> If Jo'Bril was exposed to a tetryon field, it might have left traces in his tissue.<eos> Thanks, Data.<eos> - Beverly?<eos> - Yes?<eos> The shuttle will take you to Starbase 23.
I CAN'T STOP WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ME.<eos> I'LL PAY, MAN.<eos> I WILL PAY.<eos> YES, OF COURSE, YOU WILL.<eos> THE ONLY TREATMENT FOR SURE IS CALLED KURLATI.<eos> IT KILLS THE CURSE BY DESTROYING THE EVIL HALF OF THE PERSON ATTACHED.<eos> OK.<eos> BUT IN A CASE AS CLEARLY ADVANCED AS YOURS, THERE IS ONE SMALL SNAGGET.<eos> WHAT?<eos> IT WILL PROBABLY KILL YOU.
AND THEN WHEN THE DAY IS DONE, THEY CAN STOP SCREWIN' ME SO THEY CAN FUCK ME!<eos> WHOO! WELL, I SAY SCREW THAT.<eos> SCREW THEM. SCREW THE COMPANY.<eos> UH, EXCUSE ME, PLEASE, MA'AM, BUT JUST EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS<eos> OIL, BUBBA.<eos> BUBBA?<eos> THE DISCOVERY AND DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK CRUDE.<eos> Bubba?<eos> DAMN IT!<eos> I KNEW I'D FIND YOU HERE.
You don't really believe in that stuff, do you?<eos> I take it you don't?<eos> No, I think it's all just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon.<eos> So, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogee, have you?<eos> No, I haven't. Why? You should ride with us sometime.<eos> You might see some things that will change your mind.<eos> Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night.<eos> Where's Mulder?<eos> Where did you get the document?<eos> If you explain to me what you're talking about, maybe I can help you out.
Not just once, but for as long as they could get away with it.<eos> That night Howard was crying. He'd found out Isfahan had claimed responsibility for killing a couple of sailors in Florida.<eos> He was never the same and I thought...<eos> that's why he killed himself.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> I saw...<eos> Howard showed me how Dorlund had him killed.<eos> Made it look like a suicide.<eos> He could see Howard was gonna put an end to the deal.<eos> So now Howard is protecting you?
Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything.<eos> Father, I just had the most wonderful time.<eos> - I'm so happy.<eos> - You should be, Jasmine.<eos> I have chosen a husband for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - You will wed Jafar.<eos> You're speechless, I see.<eos> A fine quality in a wife.<eos> I will never marry you.
This is a maximum-security prison and you have no weapons of any kind?<eos> We have some carving knives in the abattoir, a few more in the mess hall, some fire axes.<eos> - Nothing terribly formidable.<eos> - That's all?<eos> We're on the honor system.<eos> - Then we're fucked.<eos> - No.<eos> You're fucked.<eos> Confined to the infirmary. Quarantined.<eos> Mr Aaron will escort you.
Simon.<eos> You scared me by showing me... a glimpse of what my life might have been.<eos> Orale.<eos> Hey, be careful!<eos> Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash.<eos> Check that one out. See all the people?<eos> They were throwing rice and shit.<eos> Look at mama.<eos> Pull over up here. I gotta take a leak.<eos> This medal I send to you as a gift... for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use.
I have neither money nor attorneys, and Gus is my only real friend.<eos> I wasn't talking about real friends.<eos> - Why doesn't Gus like me?<eos> - I like you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You want to come up for a drink?<eos> - I didn't think you'd ask me.<eos> I guess you don't know your character that well.<eos> Pretty soon I'll know you better than you know yourself.
How much did you pay Nilsen for my file?<eos> Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?<eos> What if I ask you not to call me Shooter?<eos> - How about I call you Nicky?<eos> - My wife called me that.<eos> I know.<eos> I like it.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Friends call me Catherine.<eos> - What did Manny Vasquez call you?
I'm ready, Max.<eos> I've been down here too long.<eos> It's time for me to ascend to re-emerge with your help your know-how your savvy.<eos> I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.<eos> I come from like you.<eos> And, like you, I want some respect!<eos> A recognition of my basic humanity.<eos> But most of all I want to find out who I am by finding my parents learning my human name.<eos> Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted!<eos> And exactly why am I going to help you?
Oh, furious soul. Oh, wasted bread.<eos> You see how they pull my teeth up and you do nothing.<eos> Don't start again.<eos> I'd prefer having lost an arm.<eos> Not again.<eos> You. You must know that Don Quixote will defend the honour of Dulcinea del Toboso against anyone who wants to stain it.<eos> If you are not careful, you're going to kill yourself.<eos> I hope they haven't heard you.<eos> I challenge anyone who says that there is a maid more beautiful that the matchless Dulcinea.<eos> If the one in the tower hears you, we're in troubles.
Have you seen a big and dark box, with noises and with strange images?<eos> It's not going to eat you, man!<eos> Have you seen a noisy box that tells the news...?<eos> Where can I find a box that talks about the moon and about a man with metallic chest?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Are you foreigners? - Of course.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Ask them where is my master. Who is your boss?<eos> There aren't masters anymore.<eos> I understand you too.
Somehow I remember what I first saw in you... when you were a doctor... doing simple things well.<eos> I do love that.<eos> I still love that.<eos> I was expecting you.<eos> Do you know Peter Wetzlar?<eos> I don't.<eos> This is Martyn's father.<eos> Peter stopped by.<eos> He lives in Paris.<eos> What brings you to London?
It's just something I...<eos> Here it is.<eos> Thank you. This is it. I couldn't get it.<eos> Have it for as long as you like.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I won't intrude any longer. I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to bust in. Not at all.<eos> Very nice to meet you.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> I hope we all see you sometime.
- Sorry, sir.<eos> - We got carried away.<eos> - They found him!<eos> - Found who?<eos> The Angel of Flight 104.<eos> It was on the news, sir.<eos> Just now.<eos> He's gonna be on Channel 4 at noon.<eos> We'll sustain the bail at $25,000.<eos> That ought to keep you out of trouble.
Pulls you off, saves your purse and forgets to return it.<eos> That's version 63.<eos> Version 64, he says he kept it to pay for his hundred-dollar shoes.<eos> He's a two-bit bullshit artist.<eos> Already got a sentence pending for dealing stolen goods.<eos> Listen.<eos> This guy, the hero Bubber?<eos> He was a homeless guy, right?<eos> I mean, he was down on his luck.<eos> He couldn't have swiped your purse while rescuing you and sold it to LaPlante?
He belongs to me.<eos> Come on!<eos> Go away!<eos> He's mine!<eos> Mine!<eos> That was Gale Gayley being escorted into the hotel by police officers.<eos> Gale, who was rescued from the plane crash by John Bubber has a special relationship with the Angel of Flight 104.<eos> Now, as to what she might be doing here at the hotel...<eos> He'll only talk to you, and he won't move any closer.<eos> Just lean out. We'll hold you from behind.
You and I can close our eyes and sleep at night knowing that the world we know today will be there tomorrow, and the next day, and the week after that.<eos> I repeat, Doctor, until the day comes when we know what we're dealing with, until we can give solid answers, the policy of this government remains.<eos> Nothing is out there.<eos> It's just science fiction.<eos> The domain of a very rabid, lunatic fringe.<eos> What's the point of this meeting?<eos> We want you to join us, help us find the answers.<eos> We need people like you in this group.<eos> Now, Doctor, they would be willing to make you an excellent arrangement.<eos> They'll let you in and show you things that will amaze you beyond your dreams.
Webb's not in Albany.<eos> He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.<eos> Webb is at Edward?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> That's only 12 miles away.<eos> He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow.<eos> You, sir. Pick your man.<eos> Major Heyward will provide a diversion.<eos> I'll draft out a dispatch.<eos> Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later.
You shouldn't join any organization unless you know exactly what it's about.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You shouldn't give up so easily either.<eos> We could use more young warriors like yourself.<eos> Come on by the temple next Wednesday, 8:00.<eos> 8:00 sharp.<eos> Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.<eos> Thank you, Mr. X. And I won't make you out a liar either.<eos> No, I don't think you will.<eos> Tonight, I shall introduce you as my national minister.
I thought I did.<eos> Palala.<eos> No, no, I've got something better.<eos> Give it.<eos> No, no.<eos> What is it?<eos> Yoco tree.<eos> The bark is 3% pure caffeine-- cures headaches, fatigue, aches, pains, neuritis, neuralgia.<eos> Drink it.<eos> It'll keep you on your feet 'til dinnertime.
What do you want?<eos> Anything wet.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself down there in the lower galley?<eos> You and your friend in that tight, little place?<eos> Tell me, Marti.<eos> Did the hero get into your tight, little place?<eos> You're repulsive!<eos> You'll change your mind once we get to know each other.<eos> You'll have to kill me first.<eos> No, Marti I'm going to kill you during.
But I'll handle the press, the police, the judge and the witness for you. Mr. Mill.<eos> Thank you for coming down without a fight. You know, it's really in your best interest. What, did you sleep in that suit?<eos> Mr. Mill, get away from that woman. She's the enemy. - Follow me.<eos> - Hi, Susan.<eos> - Had a lovely time at the Mint the other night.<eos> - I can't believe you remember it.<eos> Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.<eos> I'm here to represent you. Dick Mellen called me in on this.<eos> Here's the situation. They've got a witness, and they want you to do a lineup.<eos> Now, if you say no, they'll arrest you, I'm certain of that.

I remember it in German.<eos> Could you remember it in English, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> - What's wrong with my accent?<eos> - It's from the gutter.<eos> But it's supposed to be.<eos> I'm a cook.<eos> But not one that Drescher would accept.<eos> Don't you know he's a man of great pretensions?<eos> With that vulgar sound, he won't let you in at the door.
- Well, hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> You know Miss Albrecht?<eos> Stayson von Neest.<eos> You know Captain von Haefler of the Foreign Office.<eos> - Von Haefler, nice to meet you again.<eos> - Of course!<eos> You're the one who served the raw ducks.<eos> I was at Drescher's.<eos> - Your old employer wants you back.
-We can change this city.<eos> People love their cars.<eos> Yes.<eos> But...<eos> -But if you give them great...<eos> -Coffee.<eos> Coffee...<eos> And great music.<eos> If you...<eos> I'll put it to you like this, and then I'll thank you for your time.
Your call, Maxime.<eos> - When do you finish?<eos> - Tomorrow, in theory.<eos> Maxime said you were quite pleased.<eos> I think so.<eos> I'm not sure anymore.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you avoiding me?<eos> I'm not avoiding you.
I thought you cared about my work.<eos> Is it because of Maxime?<eos> Maxime?<eos> You might have scruples, as he's your friend.<eos> There's no friendship between us.<eos> No friendship?<eos> No. We've been partners for years.<eos> We complement each other.<eos> It's to our mutual interest, that's all.<eos> He thinks of you as a friend.
Mm-hm.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I like that!<eos> - Bye.<eos> Michael, I'm being grilled here!<eos> This area's high crime, right? You get the people in.<eos> How do you keep the bad element out? I'm into that as we speak.<eos> I'm working on security now.<eos> Michael, you remember Officer Davis?<eos> Oh, yeah! How are you doing? I didn't recognize you out of uniform.
- Why not now?<eos> I must go to the bank.<eos> I don't go around carrying that kind of money.<eos> Permit me, then, to take charge of - what you're carrying so it doesn't burden you.<eos> You think I'd carry off my belongings in a bag?<eos> Those are the rules.<eos> You are not to remove so much as a single hair until the rent is paid.<eos> These are not hairs but shirts that I am taking to be ironed - at he laundry just next door to the bank.<eos> Please do not misunderstand me - but experience has shaken my faith in tenants.<eos> Hugo had best accompany you to the bank.
Marcel Marx.<eos> Two half-trouts.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> That was a curious order.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> This method yields on average a quarter more - than when a full portion is ordered.<eos> Where is my order?<eos> Unfortunately the last of the trout went to this gentleman here.<eos> May I invite you to partake of this course with me?<eos> I would not deprive you what is yours, sir.
Let's see your cards.<eos> Take it.<eos> - How did you know I was bluffing?<eos> - I just had a feeling.<eos> I guess it's better to be lucky than good.<eos> It's the way your left eyebrow raises when you're bluffing.<eos> Just kidding, Commander.<eos> - Ogawa to Dr Crusher.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.
20.<eos> Your 20. I'll raise you 50.<eos> You're going to call my bluff.<eos> I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.<eos> How did you know I'd call your bluff?<eos> - I just had a feeling.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Ogawa to Dr Crusher.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.
All threes.<eos> I was positive I knew what cards were going to be dealt.<eos> I was also sure.<eos> Finish dealing the hand.<eos> Look at this.<eos> We've all got three of a kind.<eos> First we get a three and then three of a kind.<eos> Ogawa to Dr Crusher.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.
I'm here because of my familiarity with methods of generating them.<eos> Mr. Worf, your presence is obvious.<eos> Doctor, your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxins we find.<eos> Celtris III is in Cardassian space.<eos> How will we get there undetected?<eos> I know a way of acquiring some discreet transport.<eos> Mr. Worf, set a course for Torman V.<eos> If he doesn't pay up, I know three large Ferengi who will not be so forgiving.<eos> - I didn't do it!<eos> - I'm not accusing you of anything.
I've been waiting for over an hour...<eos> I'm Capt Jellico.<eos> You know Cmdr Riker.<eos> This is Lt Cmdr Troi.<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> This is a deliberate insult.<eos> I have been kept waiting for over an hour!<eos> Then I'm sure you're ready to talk.<eos> I did not agree to allow others into this meeting.<eos> If it alarms you, I can ask them to leave.
Aye, sir.<eos> Set course 350, mark 215 and engage at warp 8.5.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Where were you?<eos> At home.<eos> Sunday dinner.<eos> We would all sing afterwards.<eos> What a charming picture.<eos> The Picard family, voices raised in song.<eos> Is that what's keeping you from breaking?
Stress on the hull would be too great.<eos> Captain, the density appears lower off the starboard bow.<eos> Ensign, bring us to 030, mark five.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Forward velocity holding.<eos> Steady as she goes.<eos> - Something wrong with the cake?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I see you with a piece of untouched chocolate cake.<eos> I assume something's wrong with the cake or with you.
- I need an emergency Medical team.<eos> - On our way.<eos> Mr Worf, prepare to transport these prisoners down to the moon's surface.<eos> Gladly, sir.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 45572.1.<eos> Dr Crusher has examined Troi, Data and O'Brien.<eos> There seem to be no residual effects.<eos> It was as if my own consciousness were pushed to the side.<eos> I watched everything, heard my voice, but wasn't able to control it.<eos> The entity that controlled you, what were your perceptions?
First Officer's log, supplemental.<eos> We have reached the Ligos system. We have begun to search for the missing science team.<eos> Dr Crusher reports no progress on a cure for the shuttle crew.<eos> Come.<eos> I came to see how you're doing.<eos> I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well.<eos> It's just so ridiculous.<eos> I can't take myself seriously like this.<eos> Counsellor, if Dr Crusher can't find a cure, if I have to stay this way, nobody's gonna take me seriously, are they?<eos> I would say the people that know you and have worked with you will be able to make the adjustment eventually.
- Me too, sir.<eos> The Ferengi claim two freighters were destroyed by Cardassians in your sector.<eos> Is there any evidence?<eos> I'm loathe to believe them about anything... ..but there was evidence of Cardassian weapons.<eos> If the Cardassians also attacked the Yosemite, it could indicate a large movement in this sector.<eos> I have an away team on board.<eos> The initial report indicates there was an explosion, but not if it was an attack.<eos> - How soon until you know?<eos> - A few hours.<eos> If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact you.
Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors cannot track them.<eos> Perhaps we could construct a homing device.<eos> Something that our sensors could track.<eos> Good idea, but there's no way to get that device to the source.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> They've taken me for the last few nights.<eos> The same thing will happen tonight.<eos> If you had a homing device, we could track it in subspace.<eos> As soon as they send you back, we could neutralize the emissions.
No one can get in or out.<eos> We are capable of matter-energy transport.<eos> Matter-energy?<eos> We can take you through the structure.<eos> Really?<eos> That's quite remarkable.<eos> May we arrange your transport?<eos> No, I must remain here. But under the circumstances, I will permit a small delegation inside the biosphere.<eos> Very good.<eos> Cmdr Riker and team will be with you shortly.
- What are you having, boys?<eos> - Aldorian ale's our drink.<eos> - Then it's mine, too.<eos> - Bartender.<eos> - They have a minor problem.<eos> - They could use a hand.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I believe I will stay.<eos> - Mr Data's protecting me.<eos> - Protecting you? From what?
I'm not sure. I'll tell her to contact you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You could stay here and wait for her, if you, you know, wanted to.<eos> Tell her I'll be in shuttle bay two.<eos> - You're attracted to him.<eos> - I am not.<eos> I think you are.<eos> How repulsive.<eos> How do you stand that hair all over his face?<eos> Doctor, Cmdr Riker was looking for you.
- That's me.<eos> - Take a seat.<eos> Well, Mr. Dash for your probation, you owe us 100 hours of community service.<eos> Let's see what we've got.<eos> The L.A. Housing Facility needs help with bricklaying.<eos> No laying bricks or stuff like that.<eos> I don't do that lifting shit.<eos> - Graffiti removal?<eos> - You heard what I said?<eos> Does that preclude you from doing anything strenuous?
I would never rat on you.<eos> You ain't gonna kill me, are you?<eos> I'm going to try very hard to forget that this ever happened. - I owe you my life, Ben.<eos> - I'd say that's a fair assessment.<eos> Bend your knees, Harry.<eos> When you jump from the train, bend your knees to soften the impact. Okay, Ben.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> This has been four of the most wonderful days I've ever spent.<eos> A lot of it was in the motion of the train.<eos> He knows you. Are you somebody, too?
The word has no meaning.<eos> A bug is a colloquialism.<eos> It has no basis in reality.<eos> Insects include a wide variety of living creatures.<eos> None of them can be called a bug!<eos> I certainly didn't mean any offence, Mr. Siegel.<eos> Mind if I look around, Larry?<eos> - Do you mind if I call you Larry?<eos> - All my friends call me Larry.<eos> - What brings you to L.A., Ben? - Curiosity.
But she can be so difficult.<eos> Asking for the Master on your wedding night! So impolite to you!<eos> Wasn't she sick?<eos> Sick?<eos> She's just spoiled!<eos> Has the Master left?<eos> Just now.<eos> They're putting out the lanterns.<eos> Let's meet the Third Mistress.<eos> Third Mistress says she isn't feeling well and says she'll meet you another day.
- No, no...<eos> - No problem.<eos> I've made a pot of tea.<eos> - Shall I pour you a cup?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> - I hope you don't find me too bold.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Why should I?<eos> - A girl invites you to her flat.
He's not even a good one!<eos> - I'm telling you, I can walk!<eos> - And I'm telling you, hospital regulations.<eos> - You can walk when you're outside.<eos> - Oh, this is ridiculous!<eos> I'm gonna get your discharge papers.<eos> Just stay put!<eos> Boy, what a pain!<eos> Are you ready for this?<eos> Dr. Kirkwood is just stringing you along!
- Welcoming committee.<eos> - I hope you're hungry.<eos> Evening, ladies.<eos> Ben Stone, this here is Miss Violet and Miss Lillian and Miss Maddie.<eos> Ladies, this here is Ben Stone, M.D.<eos> Fried chicken, boiled peanuts and sweet potato pie.<eos> Catfish, biscuits, butter beans and watermelon.<eos> Hungry-Man dinner.<eos> I'm a bad cook.<eos> Well, I guess I'll just say adieu and come chauffeur you in the morning.
Stone, see if patient number 434 is in preop yet.<eos> We can squeeze one more in before lunch, don't you think?<eos> This is the National Weather Service forecast... for the greater Grady area tomorrow.<eos> There'll be plenty of sunshine and blue skies.<eos> The old temperature should be in the 90s again... but a cool afternoon breeze will make it all worthwhile come evening.<eos> Y'all look out for the lightning bugs after sunset.<eos> - Actress alert.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Some girl called for you.<eos> Said you'd know who it was, said she'd meet you at this bar.
That's what most people say.<eos> Our policies only cost $10 per month.<eos> Mister, I'm too young to be getting life insurance.<eos> We're not just talking about you.<eos> Think about your children.<eos> I ask you only one thing, Mrs. Dotson.<eos> Just glance at these news clippings here in my hand. What about them?<eos> What they show in frightening detail is the high rate of violent death caused by gangs and crime in your neighborhood.<eos> Can I hand these to you to look at?<eos> Look, Mrs. Dotson, I'm not going to kid you.
You're a heavyweight.<eos> You're a Yoda among cops.<eos> You know Yoda?<eos> Little guy, big ears, real smart.<eos> So it doesn't matter what you think of me, cos I have respect for you.<eos> And that is where I'm coming from.<eos> Look, dickwad, I don't give a rat's ass where you're coming from.<eos> - I just care about where you're going.<eos> - Good, we're talking.<eos> Where do I drop you off?
- I just care about where you're going.<eos> - Good, we're talking.<eos> Where do I drop you off?<eos> Where are you staying?<eos> - Give me a name. - I'm staying with you.<eos> Maybe when my asshole learns to chew gum.<eos> - I thought this was arranged.<eos> - Nobody arranged jackshit with me.<eos> You know, a lot of people would be excited to have Nick Lang in their home.<eos> I'll drop you off at their place.
Any other bids?<eos> Going once ...<eos> Going twice ...<eos> Gone!<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - It was nothing.<eos> No, you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> Thanks for saving me.<eos> - Why was that guard chasing you?
You're a fighter.<eos> I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.<eos> Mr. Garrison, how are you?<eos> Remember me?<eos> You vote for me?<eos> I did.<eos> We sang together at the Royal Orleans, remember?<eos> We sang:<eos> "You're the cream in my coffee"<eos> Haven't seen you much lately.
You said this afternoon perhaps.<eos> Yes, perhaps...<eos> The master will soon be in.<eos> Yes, I know!<eos> I won't see him. I couldn't stand it!<eos> I can't forgive him for knowing me! Never.<eos> Mother Rolet!<eos> Mother Rolet, for pity's sake!<eos> I can't breathe!<eos> I'll unlace you.
I am interested in selling a large stash of the black meat. Verstehen Sie?<eos> The sun-dried, powdered black meat of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede.<eos> And... for some reason I am certain that you are working for Herr Dr. Benway.<eos> I'm sorry. I apparently mistook you for somebody else.<eos> But as it happens, Mr. Lee, I am, among other things a provider of rare services to the arts and in my experience as a provider of rare services to the arts I have found that writers are a particularly needy group.<eos> Is there nothing I can provide for you. Mr. Lee?<eos> A very professional operation, as you can see, Mr. Lee.<eos> You like a taste?<eos> I'd be happy to join you in a taste, if you're planning to have one.<eos> You can understand that if you were a purchasing agent for a foreign power how it would be to my advantage to impress you with the cleanliness and the sincerity of our operation.
- I do.<eos> Yes.<eos> I wouldn't use a Clark Nova myself.<eos> Too demanding.<eos> Demanding?<eos> Oh, come on. We're both writers.<eos> We know what we're talking about.<eos> Well, I'm new to this game, to tell you the truth.<eos> If I get blocked again, I'll let you try my Martinelli.<eos> Her inventiveness will surprise you.
Another one-way street!<eos> They're always changing everything. Fuckin' idiots...<eos> I'm dangerous?<eos> I've got a taxi and they've got guns and I'm dangerous!<eos> I should turn around and run them both over.<eos> # I see by your outfit #<eos> A bishop alone in Rome at 4:00 a.m.!<eos> Bad luck! Touch my balls.<eos> Excuse me, Father.<eos> The statue confused me. I couldn't see you.
They put one in every taxi. It's ridiculous.<eos> Father, I know this will sound a little strange, but here we are alone, at night in a taxi, and it's a little embarrassing, but I would like to confess.<eos> But this is not the appropriate place, my son.<eos> I know, I said it myself we're in a taxi, not church, but I must confess, Father.<eos> Dear son, confession is an act that must remain anonymous. The church must preserve this anonymity.<eos> Otherwise...<eos> But I promise I won't tell anyone!<eos> I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.<eos> I've had this taxi for 15 years here in Rome, and in 15 years I swear I've never picked up the same person twice.<eos> And even if I picked you up again in 10 years I wouldn't recognize you, dressed as a bishop.
There is someone here.<eos> Miss Nassimi.<eos> She came to help you.<eos> Hamid told me you wished to leave Iran.<eos> You know it is extremely dangerous.<eos> I have to get back to the United States.<eos> - Why don't you try to get a divorce?<eos> - No.<eos> If I get a divorce, my husband will get custody of my daughter.<eos> If they catch you with your daughter, they could execute you.
I'm marrying a brute.<eos> I never wanna see your face again - until the wedding!<eos> That's fine with me!<eos> And separate honeymoons!<eos> - Fine!<eos> - See you in church!<eos> It's probably Judge Crater.<eos> Oh, hi, Dr Poole.<eos> Come on in.<eos> The boss been expecting you.
- It was sittin' here in the library before... so I switched the bags for ya.<eos> - And where was Einstein?<eos> - Was Connie in here?<eos> Connie, was you in here?<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> Why don't you go stand over there next to your girlfriend?<eos> Mush!<eos> Underwear. Underwear?<eos> Und- "Underwood." Underwood.<eos> Mr Provolone will see you in the library.
What the hell is it with you doctors?<eos> Does " Callanwolde" mean anything to you?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Savannah kept repeating it when she first came out of the coma.<eos> " Callanwolde, Callanwolde. " No?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have to get back to the hospital.<eos> It's late.<eos> I can't see you tomorrow till about 7:30.
Look, I gotta know.<eos> We're either honest with each other or it doesn't happen. It just stops right here.<eos> It never started.<eos> Hillgrove Nursing Home.<eos> - May I speak to Chloe Williams, please?<eos> - Who's calling, please?<eos> - A friend of the family.<eos> - Just a minute. I'll put you through.<eos> Hello?<eos> Speak up, please. I can't hear you.
Why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> 'Cause you can't.<eos> Because you just can't.<eos> Trust me on this.<eos> Look. I'm gonna go get my mom. I orderyou to help me.<eos> You have a Sarah Connor here?<eos> You're runnin' kind of late.<eos> They've been in there for an hour. Hold on a second.<eos> I'll buzz you in.
- That's... really funny, man...<eos> - Why! ?<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'll tell you something, I'm getting sick of you...<eos> - Look man, I'm just trying to make some conversation.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> Go talk to someone else...<eos> - You have a beer, that's 2 dollars, pal!<eos> - I can't believe it, man! - It's my fucking birthday! And some guy who's supposed to be my best friend can't buy me a fucking beer!<eos> ...really gonna sound silly and I hope you don't take this wrong way but I saw you in a train and I just wanna tell you you have the most beautiful legs I've ever seen.
Are you Kleinman?<eos> Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Why is he putting my name on the list?<eos> You've been warned twice now.<eos> What is this list? Might I just ask?<eos> I have a donation to make.<eos> The poor box is in the front.<eos> No, this doesn't fit in the poor box.<eos> Kleinman, you want me to take you in?
Use your drugs to revive him.<eos> Those drugs increase cardial rate. That's the last thing he needs.<eos> It'd probably be enough to kill him.<eos> You can't do it!<eos> Revive him.<eos> I'm just a physician, Minister.<eos> I know little about affairs of State, but he is a living, intelligent being.<eos> I don't care if the Chancellor himself calls.<eos> I have sworn an oath to do no harm, and I will not.<eos> Then I'll find someone to replace you.
Come.<eos> Time for you to leave us?<eos> Captain. I have come to officially request... ..asylum aboard the Enterprise.<eos> Timicin, I cannot believe this.<eos> Why asylum?<eos> - Asylum from what?<eos> - I turn 60 in four days.<eos> Yes, and your family and colleagues are gathering for your Resolution.<eos> I believe that it is time for us to re-examine, as a people,... ..the wisdom of the Resolution.<eos> Are they forcing you into this?
- May I make a suggestion?<eos> - By all means.<eos> Relax.<eos> You've written a brilliant speech.<eos> It will need to be.<eos> I'm addressing the greatest scientific minds in the Federation.<eos> Switzer, Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland!<eos> Giants in archaeology!<eos> Compared to them, I'm just an amateur.<eos> I doubt they see you as an amateur.
- Excuse me?<eos> I was referring to the view.<eos> Eternity never looked so lovely.<eos> You must be Cmdr Riker.<eos> - You have me at a disadvantage.<eos> - I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> I believe you were about to tell me that my eyes are as mysterious as the stars.<eos> You're Betazoid.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It's just that Jean-Luc does a very good imitation of you.
This is England, or to be precise, Q's recreation of Sherwood Forest.<eos> That explains the costumes.<eos> Right, Number One.<eos> Or should I say John Little.<eos> If he's Little John, that makes you...<eos> I know!<eos> Robin Hood.<eos> Sir, I protest!<eos> I am not a Merry Man!<eos> On the contrary, Lt Worf, your clothing identifies you as Will Scarlet. Geordi's mandolin identifies him as Alan-a-Dale.
Did that occur to you?<eos> I cannot see what effect my being here...<eos> If you had been in contact with the entity, if that's the reason Melona was attacked, it would not kill its ally.<eos> Do you believe that I lured the entity here?<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No, Doctor.<eos> Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta, you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> My programming is different from Lore's.<eos> I am accusing you of collaborating with that monster!
- Did you?<eos> - No, Doctor.<eos> Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta, you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> My programming is different from Lore's.<eos> I am accusing you of collaborating with that monster!<eos> I am attempting to explain to you it is impossible.<eos> Amazing!<eos> You can't feel anything, can you?<eos> - Nothing I say to you hurts you!
But the hunt didn't end there.<eos> Another man, Mr. Simon Tarses, was brought to trial.<eos> And it was a trial, no matter what others choose to call it.<eos> A trial based on insinuation and innuendo.<eos> Nothing substantive offered against Mr. Tarses, much less proven.<eos> Mr. Tarses' grandfather is Romulan.<eos> And for that reason his career now stands in ruins.<eos> Have we become so... fearful, have we become so cowardly,... ..that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current enemy?<eos> Admiral,... ..let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else, because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocent associations.<eos> I implore you, do not continue with this... ..proceeding.
- I fear that day...<eos> - How dare you!<eos> You who consort with Romulans invoke my father's name to support your traitorous arguments!<eos> It is an offence to everything I hold dear.<eos> And to hear those words used to subvert the Federation!<eos> My father was a great man.<eos> His name stands for integrity and principle.<eos> You dirty his name when you speak it.<eos> He loved the Federation. But you, Captain, corrupt it. You undermine our very way of life.<eos> I will expose you for what you are!
Will, it's Beverly.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Hello.<eos> You're going to be alright.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You look a little tired, Dr Beverly.<eos> I know this must be disturbing, Governor, but you must convince the moons' inhabitants that I am Odan.<eos> I have his skills, his thoughts, his memories.<eos> They will perceive you as a Starfleet officer, perhaps with your own agenda.
We have enough troubles. We don't wish to divert resources to such a trivial war.<eos> - You'll give them independence?<eos> - Perhaps.<eos> Conquer them again later, if we wish.<eos> May I ask, what has this to do with us?<eos> The Governor has charged that the Federation is aiding the rebels.<eos> Does he have evidence?<eos> Council has sent me to examine that evidence.<eos> It was my decision to invite you to accompany me.<eos> Many on the Council have great respect for you.
You should trust that.<eos> Deanna, I've always wanted to earn your respect.<eos> You've got it, from all of us.<eos> We don't need any more convincing.<eos> Please,... obey the Captain's orders.<eos> Stop whatever it is you're doing.<eos> You must trust me.<eos> How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders?<eos> Trust me.<eos> The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you.
That's probably what they think about us.<eos> We're not the same at all.<eos> We do not start wars.<eos> We do not make surprise attacks on manned outposts.<eos> We do not butcher women and children in their homes.<eos> Children... who never had the chance to grow up.<eos> You were with me on Setlik.<eos> You saw what they did.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What was the name of that fellow who always hung around you like a puppy?
Somehow I think it is not.<eos> Logic cannot explain why, but I know I must pursue this.<eos> Even if it leads to a Romulan trap?<eos> If the Romulans do have an ulterior motive, it is in the best interests of all that we determine what it is.<eos> So, I will play the role that they would have me play.<eos> Any success, Mr Data?<eos> Negative, Captain.<eos> The Romulans use a progressive encryption lock.<eos> I am unable to penetrate their security.<eos> May I assist you, Commander?
Of course you will.<eos> And your arm will be fine, too.<eos> Your shoulder was pretty badly dislocated.<eos> It was a little stubborn, but I finally popped it back in.<eos> What I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs.<eos> Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could've done any better.<eos> It's not nearly as bad as it looks.<eos> You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the right leg is fractured, too.<eos> I could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile.<eos> And as soon as the roads open, I'll take you to a hospital.
There'll be some people there to meet us.<eos> Then we can get off this damn train.<eos> These guys can't just go blasting<eos> Everybody in sight.<eos> They' re professionals. They start a war on a train in the boondocks,<eos> They got a good chance of being caught. They have to find you, do it cleanly,<eos> Without drawing attention to themselves.<eos> If they don't know where you are, You're OK. It's going to be OK, really.<eos> I'm telling you, It's going to be all right.<eos> I'm not going to Los Angeles with you.
That's what I told Mr. Molto.<eos> All of these deductions depend...<eos> On the presence of spermicidal jelly...<eos> In the specimen you sent to the forensic chemist?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How many autopsies do you perform in a week, Dr. Kumagai?<eos> One, two...<eos> Ten.<eos> It all depends.<eos> Would it surprise you to know you performed 18 autopsies...
- Vivian.<eos> Well, Miss Vivian, things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.<eos> Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer, and we like to think of our special customers as friends.<eos> As a customer, we would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests, but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it.<eos> Now, I'm assuming that you're a relative?<eos> - I thought so.<eos> Then you must be his...<eos> - Niece?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Take care of you.<eos> No, I can't. I can't. It's your favourite.<eos> What time's your bus?<eos> An hour.<eos> Yeah, well, I gotta split, cos goodbyes make me crazy.<eos> - Take care of you.<eos> You don't have any messages for me, do you?<eos> No, I'm afraid not, sir.<eos> I'll need a car to the airport.<eos> Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.
The best way to win is to proclaim your innocence, and I have never done that for anybody.<eos> And the problem I got is I see who you are.<eos> - You'd do anything to win.<eos> - So would you.<eos> Yeah, but you don't trust the legal system.<eos> You're saying I'd manufacture witnesses, affidavits?<eos> - No, but you would sacrifice me.<eos> - Oh, please, Alan.<eos> The more I believe that you are innocent, then more nervous I am.<eos> I go out on a limb for you, you're proven guilty, I look like an asshole.
Well, there's no mistaking this German beer.<eos> It leaves a little aftertaste.<eos> - What the hell is that all about?<eos> - Just a man with a poor taste in beers.<eos> Hey, garçon, you got a light?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> No smoking here.<eos> Mr. Ackerman?<eos> It's been so long.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?<eos> Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer to the "Venus de Milo. "<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> I was nearly arrested here three years ago.<eos> They said I was photographing a military subject.<eos> - And were you?<eos> - No. A soldier and his girlfriend.<eos> They asked me to take their picture.<eos> Obviously I received the manuscript.<eos> I will take you to where we can have lunch.
Okay, just "please".<eos> Good.<eos> - This is the notary's deed.<eos> Good.<eos> - This is the bank's guarantee.<eos> Good.<eos> - And this is the blueprint.<eos> Very well.<eos> Danilo? Come here a minute.<eos> Get things ready upstairs. We'll join you later.
The escalator.<eos> You four go up.<eos> You come with me.<eos> The platform!<eos> - Which way?<eos> - To the right.<eos> Botco. Tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.<eos> Don't settle for pale memories or fake implants.<eos> Experience space travel the old-fashioned way... on a real, live holiday you can afford.<eos> I want that fucker dead. I don't blame you. I wouldn't want Quaid porking my old lady.
- This will be hard for you to accept.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> - You're not really standing here now.<eos> - Doc, you could have fooled me.<eos> - I'm quite serious.<eos> You're not here and neither am I.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - At Rekall.<eos> You're strapped into an implant chair... and I'm monitoring you from the psychoprobe console.
Bullshit. It's coincidence.<eos> And what about the girl?<eos> Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?<eos> Just as you specified.<eos> Is that coincidence?<eos> She's real. I dreamt about her before I even went to Rekall.<eos> Mr. Quaid. Can you hear yourself?<eos> She's real because you dreamed her?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Maybe this will convince you.
I think I was born on the wrong continent.<eos> By the way, you're fired.<eos> This ain't Dodge City.<eos> And you ain't Bill Hickok.<eos> I said I never had much use for one. Never said I didn't know how to use it.<eos> Somewhat the worse for wear, this appears to be Quigley.<eos> I think you have a lot to explain, sir.<eos> Not that it will do you any good.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> In pursuance of a warrant, duly attested by a justice of the peace, you are hereby charged with numerous and serious crimes, including murder... ln short, this paperwork says we can hang you.
Now...here is what I have in mind.<eos> As you see, no cabinet changes at all.<eos> It'll be seen for what it is - a sign of strength and sureness of purpose.<eos> I hope the parliamentary party will agree.<eos> I count on you to press it home to them, as Chief Whip.<eos> - I do assume I have your full support.<eos> - Of course.<eos> That goes without saying.<eos> Good.<eos> I still regard you as a candidate for high office, but... you are the strongest and most deeply respected Chief Whip this party has had, I think I may say, since the war.
He won't do that.<eos> Unless a better man were to take the leadership from him.<eos> Have you any idea what that would involve?<eos> No, but I would imagine that you have a very good idea, Francis.<eos> And I know that you're capable of doing whatever is necessary.<eos> - We're not expecting anyone, are we?<eos> I'll go.<eos> Mr Urquhart.<eos> Mattie Storin, "Chronicle". Sorry.<eos> I've been trying to contact you.
I don't know what's happening!<eos> No!<eos> Get away!<eos> - Go on!<eos> Go on!<eos> - Get away, you people!<eos> - A comment for the press, Charlie?<eos> - Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Where are they taking you, Charlie?
- Over at Doc's house.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> I talked to Mr Evers before he went home.<eos> He'd like you at his son's funeral.<eos> - I'll see him at the graveyard.<eos> - The burial's gonna be at the ranch.<eos> I'm taking the casket out there now, the family asked me to.<eos> If you'd like to ride along with me, you're welcome.<eos> I'll go by myself later on.<eos> Catch up with you, maybe.
- Number One?<eos> Mr La Forge indicated that this was not an entirely routine mission.<eos> It's a long story, but I'm sure it has nothing to do with this accident.<eos> Chief Investigator Krag of Tanugan security requests permission to beam aboard.<eos> - Granted.<eos> Escort him to the bridge.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> You had better tell me as much as possible prior to his arrival.<eos> I'm Lt Worf, head of ship's security.<eos> I will take you to the captain.
- We delay rendezvous with the Hood?<eos> - We may have to.<eos> - Lieutenant, inform the Hood.<eos> - Aye, Commander.<eos> Belay that order.<eos> There'll be no further communication without my prior authorization.<eos> Commander, may I have a word?<eos> Mr. Data, you have the bridge.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> You know I like to keep you informed as to the nature of our missions. If I don't, there's a reason.
- Do you seek jamaharon?<eos> - I don't even know what it means.<eos> The Horga'hn is for a friend.<eos> - I see.<eos> Someone close to you?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Someone you love?<eos> - I wouldn't go that far.<eos> Your attitude is most puzzling.<eos> I will leave you to your book.
Sir in the past three years, I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime.<eos> I think I'm very lucky, no matter what happens.<eos> How many people get to serve with Jean-Luc Picard?<eos> Sir... You don't know this... no one knows this, because I've never told anyone.<eos> All of the things that I've worked for... school, my science projects... getting into the Academy... I've done it all because I want you to be proud of me.<eos> If there is one thing that I've learned from you it's that you don't quit, and I'm not going to quit now.<eos> I've seen you think yourself out of worse situations than this and I'm going to think us out of this.<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> I'm not going to let you die.<eos> I'll get to the water and I'll keep you alive until they find us.
Oh, Mom.<eos> Wesley, thank God.<eos> I'm so happy to see you.<eos> You're okay. Come on.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> We found the wreckage and the arrow which indicated your direction.<eos> We'll take Wesley by stretcher, as well. No.<eos> I can walk.<eos> Doctor?<eos> We're taking you back to the Enterprise.
There were dozens of factions.<eos> They fought until the city above ground was in ruins.<eos> You and the Alliance are left?<eos> We were the two strongest factions.<eos> The government couldn't keep order, so they gave us police powers.<eos> They designed the proximity detectors to keep us under control.<eos> Apparently that didn't work very well.<eos> No.<eos> After a few months, we didn't need the government any more.<eos> - Tasha left you in amongst that?
You seem so strong in your support.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> We must free the crewmen.<eos> She is our best hope of doing so.<eos> In addition...<eos> I have become used to her.<eos> Ishara.<eos> - Thank you, Data.<eos> - You are welcome.<eos> Dr Crusher is expecting you in sickbay.
A mind-meld.<eos> Between the two of us?<eos> Do you realize the dangers involved in what you are proposing, Captain?<eos> Yes, I do, Ambassador.<eos> But I also realize the potential benefits.<eos> We would be linked telepathically, sharing our thoughts, becoming, in essence, one mind.<eos> Which for a few hours should provide the emotional control you need.<eos> In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude the treaty.<eos> It is a generous offer.<eos> But I must warn you... ..that while I would gain your stability, you would experience the fierce onslaught of emotions unleashed by my condition.
With all due respect, sir, you need me.<eos> Particularly now.<eos> Indeed?<eos> Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now.<eos> Reconsider your decision.<eos> Are you telling me to leave?<eos> I'm asking you to look at your career objectively.<eos> Will.<eos> You're ready to work without a net. You're ready to take command.<eos> And you know, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you.
I want that clear.<eos> Of course, Admiral.<eos> He is... a casualty of war.<eos> Then we have abandoned all hope of recovering him.<eos> In less than 24 hours, this armada will hit that Borg vessel with everything we can muster.<eos> Either they survive or we do.<eos> As for Picard... A great man has been lost.<eos> Your captain.<eos> My friend.<eos> Cmdr Riker, I hereby promote you to the field commission of captain.
Yet there are numerous examples when it was successful.<eos> The independence of Mexico from Spain, the Irish unification of 2024 and the Kensey Rebellion.<eos> Yes, I am aware of them.<eos> Then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for a peaceful settlement have been foreclosed?<eos> These are questions that mankind has always struggled with.<eos> Your confusion is... only human.<eos> Finn, everyone is being rounded up.<eos> - Because of her?<eos> - The Federation wants to negotiate.<eos> While the Rutian police fill up the detention cells. A Starfleet officer is working with the director. He wants to meet you.

A Starfleet officer is working with the director. He wants to meet you.<eos> I'm sure he does.<eos> Your Federation colleagues have engineered mass arrests to pressure me into releasing you.
You did that?<eos> Perhaps you would be better at combat than you think.<eos> Except that I am not programmed to kill.<eos> My improved reflexes have allowed me to kill 84 times and my improved memory<eos> Iets me remember each of those 84 faces.<eos> Can you understand how that feels?<eos> I am incapable of any feeling.<eos> Why, then, I envy you.<eos> Roga, this is Captain Picard. Captain.<eos> Mr. Danar, I am transferring you to Angosian security.
You know... I keep going over the accident in my mind, trying to figure out what went wrong.<eos> I can see Data in the shuttle,... ..almost like I'm next to him, going through the departure sequence.<eos> Why didn't I see it coming?<eos> What am I missing?<eos> Kivas wishes you to wear these clothes and to sit in your chair.<eos> I have no reason to accede to Mr. Fajo's wishes.<eos> He will give you reasons if you force him to.<eos> Mr. Fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me.<eos> The Enterprise is certain to find me.<eos> They are not looking for you.
Lieutenant.<eos> Can I get you something, Tasha?<eos> I have to know something. What happens to me in the other timeline?<eos> I don't have alternate biographies of the crew.<eos> And as I said to the captain, it's just a feeling.<eos> But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there?<eos> I can see it in your eyes, Guinan.<eos> We've known each other too long.<eos> We weren't meant to know each other at all!<eos> At least that's what I sense when I look at you.
Slowly, that's it.<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> Don't worry, we're taking you to the hospital.<eos> I don't want to go to the hospital.<eos> She's crazy!<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll take care of you<eos> An ambulance will take you to the hospital.
Who the hell are you?<eos> Assistant District Attorney Kramer.<eos> Mr. Kramer, you are new here.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> This case is what we call a piece of shit.<eos> Which, loosely translated, means you don't have any evidence.<eos> Except that District Attorney Weiss has instructed me to show you...<eos> I know who the District Attorney is, Mr. Kramer.<eos> The only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in this case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale.<eos> I'm not following you.
Come on by tomorrow.<eos> We're having a one-time-only sale... of all our luxury vehicles. I'll customize anything you want.<eos> I will personally walk you through every step of the deal.<eos> We'll have your business back on its feet by Monday... back from the dead, you might say.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Sorry. If I might interrupt... What are you doing about my husband?<eos> We've arranged for a pickup truck.<eos> I did not spend $10,000... to have my Ralph can'ted around in a pickup truck!<eos> I'll put you out of business.<eos> Or better still, I'll take you to court.
It's my job.<eos> It's my life.<eos> Well, this time let's shake hands.<eos> -Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> -Good luck, Cole.<eos> -Dr. Lewicki, could I see you?<eos> -You will, I promise.<eos> No, I mean, have some dinner, go catch a movie. I'll take you to a race.<eos> That's very sweet, really, but it won't get you back on the track any faster.
It's a local piece, small-town news.<eos> The assistant warden was murdered.<eos> Now a guard's intimated... that it might be linked to the deaths of some prisoners... nine in the last few months.<eos> We've got a gubernatorial election coming up this fall.<eos> Prisons are already an issue.<eos> We don't want this to become a part of it.<eos> The governor's put me in charge of rectifying this little mishap.<eos> We wanna send you undercover into Harrison as a prisoner.<eos> You're from Quebec.<eos> No one in jail will recognize you.
- Don't tell me what you don't want.<eos> You want me.<eos> Don't you?<eos> You're right.<eos> I do want you... in court.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You want me the same way I want you.<eos> You want me to take a risk?<eos> I want you to take a risk.<eos> I'll protect you. It's my job.
Don't work on it, do it!<eos> Right.<eos> I hope she comes back soon.<eos> I've never seen him like this.<eos> The Welfare Office called again.<eos> I'm not supposed to keep you out of the orphanage.<eos> Yes, and then send a letter to D.A. Fletcher.<eos> Can you do it? I can do anyone's handwriting.<eos> Tracy's handwriting, write...<eos> "D.A. Fletcher, I have evidence that'll destroy you.
Intimate. Oop! Zorro said you have thirty minutes with the girl you pick.<eos> But you gotta pick. Coz the rest of us gotta go.<eos> Whatever baby. Look...<eos> Why don't you and I... We can sit right over here.<eos> Are we gettin' paid?<eos> It's not right... A woman like you... You're...<eos> All alone. In a city like this.<eos> There's sharks all around. Folks, who could just as easily prey upon a woman as unusual as you.<eos> A woman so distinctively different.<eos> Somebody's gotta take care of you. Somebody like me, who can protect you.
555 over four digits.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> Martha's chicken scratches.<eos> She probably can't even read them.<eos> You know what it is?<eos> It's a phone number.<eos> When you phoned I asked everyone here at the home and there is no O'Malley here.<eos> But it is possible O'Malley is a relation of someone here.<eos> Why not leave me your number and I'll call you if there's any contact.
AII right, now listen up.<eos> Stay together, guys. No straggIers.<eos> Just get the first thing you find.<eos> -Ben, don't go alone.<eos> -Uh, I need a refill anyway.<eos> I'II join you.<eos> -I'II take care of Richie.<eos> -Be back in three minutes. No more.<eos> hello, nigger.<eos> I'II pay you back.
Good.<eos> - Why do you let him talk to you like that?<eos> - Like what?<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - I don't feel good.<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Banks?<eos> Dr. Ellison will see you now.
And I could never understand how one can seriously engage in such rubbish<eos> I'm afraid I can't help you<eos> It's my luck<eos> May I try my luck, gentlemen?<eos> You?<eos> What for?<eos> I wouldn't advise you to play<eos> Your mind-boggling success inspires hope<eos> So, you decided to switch rivals?<eos> That one, with an aureole, no longer suits you?
I agree not to hold the Inspection responsible.<eos> What's it for, anyway?<eos> Just in case.<eos> Not afraid of drowning?<eos> I'm counting on my luck.<eos> Some people are lucky, it's true.<eos> But why risk your life, just to see some ruins?<eos> It probably stinks to high heaven.<eos> All the chemical waste, it goes to the bottom.<eos> It's your business, I just have to warn you.
an ecological catastrophe.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You can't shut down factories, or stop experiments.<eos> A vicious circle.<eos> Personally, I think we couldn't freeze the glaciers, either.<eos> Water levels will keep rising.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> You're thinking another flood?<eos> Would that surprise you?
There is an energy source in the smaller continent's mountains.<eos> Magnify.<eos> Is that Iconia?<eos> Capt Varley died believing that it was.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Projectile launched from the planet surface!<eos> Its size and composition match the probe which scanned the Yamato.<eos> Shields up.<eos> Prepare a tractor beam.<eos> Mr La Forge, I'm going to assist you in your research.
I don't know.<eos> I'd be giving up a lot.<eos> There's something else you must know.<eos> This is a one-shot.<eos> You can't change your mind, or go back.<eos> And there are risks.<eos> I can offer choices, not guarantees.<eos> This is a lot to think about.<eos> I'll get back to you, Doctor.<eos> The Captain will take you home.
This is ruined.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Look, is this going to take much longer?<eos> I'll have to dispose of this safely.<eos> It's very volatile.<eos> - I'll beam it off the Enterprise.<eos> - Fine. Just do it.<eos> I'll transfer it to the transporter room.<eos> In the present context, what did she mean by, "Bust him up"?<eos> In her own way, Dr Pulaski was instructing you to take the shortest route to victory.
That's more power than our entire ship could generate.<eos> It is needed to penetrate the atmosphere.<eos> Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir.<eos> Sir, beam-down coordinates are encoded in the carrier signal.<eos> Splendid.<eos> I'll arrange for our guests to beam down.<eos> Force field off.<eos> Come in.<eos> We have arrived.<eos> Salia will be with you in just a moment.
I understand.<eos> Lieutenant sometimes, the moral obligations of command are less than clear.<eos> I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of the individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible.<eos> God knows, I don't always succeed.<eos> I have not had cause to complain, Captain.<eos> Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause.<eos> If you order me to agree to the transfusion, I will obey, of course.<eos> I don't want... to order you.<eos> But I ask you.<eos> I beg you to volunteer.
- Commander. In human parlance, I do not believe I can get the job done.<eos> My training prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact, I am less than exemplary.<eos> - What's the situation?<eos> - Their leader will not listen. He denies my arguments and speaks of structures they have built.<eos> - Try something else.<eos> - I have, sir.<eos> In the last three hours, I have spoken with 56 colonists.<eos> Ten refused to believe the threat exists. 22 favour staying and fighting the Sheliak.<eos> 1 6 prefer negotiation or some sort of passive resistance. Only eight considered evacuation. Of those...<eos> Data, I can't help you.
Captain?<eos> I've been recollecting the arrival of a new First Officer on board the Enterprise, and a manual docking confidently achieved.<eos> Well, I may have been miserly in my congratulations then, so let me make up for it now.<eos> The Captain of Starship Aries is retiring.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You've been selected as his replacement.<eos> She's in the Vega-Omicron Sector.<eos> They have picked up indications of intelligent life, though nothing confirmed.<eos> Starfleet wants to know more.<eos> That's why they want you, not for your military proficiency, but for your skill as an explorer, and as a diplomat.
- We are his family.<eos> Come.<eos> Number One?<eos> I'd be a fool to turn promotion down, wouldn't I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And if you're asking what to do, I don't know that either.<eos> I can spell out, albeit crudely, what you're choosing between.<eos> As First Officer of the Enterprise, you have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort.<eos> You are the second-in-command of Starfleet's flagship, but still second-in-command.<eos> Your promotion will transfer you to a relatively insignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy.
Aye, sir.<eos> Engineering, Mr. La Forge.<eos> We're going to execute a near-warp transport.<eos> This may be a little tricky.<eos> I would like you to handle it.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> I'm on my way. Assemble an away team, Number One. Include whoever the Doctor requires to assist her.<eos> Excuse me, sir, but there may be hundreds on the Constantinople that require emergency attention.<eos> I should be there to supervise.<eos> All right, who will replace you?
Nothing serious<eos> He'll be out in several days a dozen maybe<eos> I'd like to visit him there<eos> You know, he only just left my flat I know<eos> I'm afraid I+KI harmed him<eos> No, please don't go in there He'll be back<eos> Please tell me what happened<eos> You'll think it's funny<eos> He fell in love with you<eos> This is his field-glass He used to peep at you throught it
Get out!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Go, you mule!<eos> Richard, I'm closing you up.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You are finished, Richard.<eos> Allowing decent people to dine with wife snatchers. You're finished!<eos> I think not, Mr Spica!<eos> And if I did, where would you eat?<eos> Who would have you?
We changed us.<eos> - I have a gift for you.<eos> - I have not bought anything for you.<eos> Forget it.<eos> It's a silly little thing.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> When we get there, we can climb up to the top of the statue, if you feel like it.<eos> It is said to be 22 storeys high.<eos> It sounds amazing.<eos> Mr. Robertson, your dad was looking for you.
We don't have a choice.<eos> It's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy.<eos> It's Vigo!<eos> I don't care.<eos> You're not gonna take my baby!<eos> Oscar!<eos> You bastard!<eos> Is it a big dinosaur or a small one?<eos> Which way was it headed?<eos> What was chasing you in the park?
Go to your house.<eos> I shall be there waiting for you!<eos> You'll find ... her ... waiting for you.<eos> Can he see us from the street?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Station one, are you sure he can't see you?<eos> Inside units, I want a report every five minutes.<eos> 10 - 4.<eos> He may not be able to see you, Sheriff ...<eos> But we can all certainly hear you.
- He's not in.<eos> - Hi, this is Virginia Clayton.<eos> I called before.<eos> I'm a friend of Richard's.<eos> - Is he back yet?<eos> - No.<eos> But I gave him your message about a half-hour ago.<eos> I know. But it's very important that he calls me back.<eos> All I can do is give it to him again.<eos> I'm sure he'll call you back.
Vor...<eos> I'll just call you Adolf.<eos> Are you Arjen Rudd?<eos> Aryan...?<eos> -That's you.<eos> -It's official.<eos> They are official.<eos> Under the Diplomatic Relations Act no diplomatic agent may be detained or arrested once his identity has been established.<eos> We have a serious diplomatic situation here which I'll take up with your State Department tomorrow.<eos> I'm quaking in my boots, but I'll still bring you down.
Should we stay there?<eos> Hey, silver fox! Where's the fire? Where you goin'?<eos> Well, what about on Jupiter?<eos> At the time of his death, if he were on Jupiter, uh... Elvis would've weighed 648 pounds.<eos> 648?<eos> Damn.<eos> Hi!<eos> Good night!<eos> Good night.<eos> How may I help you?
One's age doesn't count.<eos> It's one's feelings that count.<eos> My age is greater than my feelings.<eos> It's my way of being old.<eos> Will you let me offer you a drink?<eos> I only drink during meals.<eos> Otherwise I'm a teetotaler, but I'll toast to keep you company.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bring me another.<eos> Do you know that I knew you?
It's already open.<eos> It's open.<eos> What's the food like?<eos> Not bad, but you get tired of it after four days.<eos> Do you have a card?<eos> Do we need a card?<eos> You must go to the civil parish in your neighbourhood, and apply for a card.<eos> Like this one.<eos> And if you don't have a card?<eos> If the refectory isn't too full, maybe the doorman will let you in.
What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Don't give me that.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Dope!<eos> What can punks like you do?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Try.<eos> Nito will kill you.<eos> A cop named Azuma is checking on you.
Took him for a rabbit, eh?<eos> Stupid hunters.<eos> - Are you okay, doctor Horvath?<eos> - I'm okay, George.<eos> - Hot, very hot.<eos> - What is this crap?<eos> - Easy boy. Easy boy...<eos> - Maybe I should take him someplace else.<eos> Easy boy.<eos> Doctor Horvath? We're not going to bother you any longer, okay?
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.<eos> You are going to want to borrow my apartment.<eos> No, but thank you.<eos> That's sweet. But I can't do that to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If she finds out you live with your folks, you will embarrass yourself.<eos> Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.<eos> It is the cockroaches, isn't it?<eos> - Well... - They scatter when the lights go on.<eos> Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.
No...<eos> Yeah, I'm self-conscious.<eos> Not in the same way that you are, though.<eos> Me? Me?<eos> You think I'm self-conscious?<eos> Well...<eos> I've been watching you. You know, I've been watching you...<eos> I watch you eat. I watch you speak.<eos> Watch you move, and I...<eos> I see somebody who is extremely aware of people looking at you.
- Yeah, John Mullany for Brian Kirkland.<eos> - Just one moment, please.<eos> - All right.<eos> Anyway, as I've always said, work is critical.<eos> I can be happy without a marriage, but if you take away my work...<eos> I mean, that's different.<eos> And ifAnn can't handle that, well, that's her problem.<eos> - Mr Mullany.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Mr DeForest would like to see you in his office.
Fool.<eos> Well...<eos> Hope he knows what he's doing.<eos> - Mr Mullany.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr DeForest is waiting.<eos> All right. Tell him I'll be in, in a minute.<eos> Jesus.<eos> The old man thinks that the world revolves around a game of golf.<eos> Listen, why don't I catch up to you at the courts in a few minutes?
- Bridge to holodeck control.<eos> Worf.<eos> - Here, sir.<eos> - Status?<eos> Anything changed?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Moriarty, you were... conjured up in an attempt to defeat Holmes here. Once that attempt is concluded, your program has run its course. Your existence is done.<eos> Congratulations, Professor. I capitulate to the better man. Your victory, sir, is... is well earned.<eos> It's gone beyond that game, Mr. Data.<eos> Note I no longer call you Holmes.
"Rogue"?<eos> Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain, wild element...<eos> Yes, Data, but there is no malevolence or ill will.<eos> Audio on.<eos> You have a burnout in your guidance system.<eos> If you can diagnose my problems, why not help fix them?<eos> Captain, we can easily repair the system he uses.<eos> - We can accommodate you.<eos> - First Officer here.<eos> If you shut down your engines, we can beam you over.
Thank you.<eos> This time it will be different, I promise.<eos> It always is, my love.<eos> You said my life would never be dull,... and it never has been.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Computer, this is Troi. Request access.<eos> Terminate the current program?<eos> - No, continue the program.<eos> - Enter when ready.<eos> The Captain is waiting for you inside.
Computer, this is Troi. Request access.<eos> Terminate the current program?<eos> - No, continue the program.<eos> - Enter when ready.<eos> The Captain is waiting for you inside.<eos> How's this possible?<eos> It's Paris.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Madame, this way.<eos> The Captain is waiting for you.
I am a man... from Earth.<eos> I am the one who has taken you inside me.<eos> You are of two minds, sir.<eos> You have not finished your work, and you hesitate whether to go back.<eos> I know whom you want to talk to, sir.<eos> My father, to get him out of your way;<eos> and to Shern Swiny because he opposes you.<eos> Do you feel disgraced?<eos> Spurned?<eos> I love you, sir, as nobody ever will.
We need metal, saltpeter, and manpower.<eos> You have decided, sir.<eos> People of little faith.<eos> Can it be otherwise?<eos> Isn't this right, dancer?<eos> You know everything, sir.<eos> Oh, world!<eos> What have I done not to comprehend you?<eos> - Are you satisfied?<eos> - Sir, we are savoring you.
She was beautiful and famous?<eos> Yes.<eos> You've never loved her.<eos> What is this for?<eos> For your departure tomorrow. To pay homage to what exists and reject nothing of what doesn't.<eos> The tangibility of evil which we see around.<eos> The submission to the narrow labyrinths of one's own sensual passion.<eos> The belief in the importance of those who wield power over us means creating evil, conjuring it in the dark,<eos> transforming oneself into a murderous gland which considers everything its own property.<eos> Why does a woman concern you, sir?
I had spent a second sleepless night, and the following day at work I felt it.<eos> I couldn't write at all, and what little I did try was forced.<eos> Usually I can't sleep in the day, but I was exhausted.<eos> I closed my eyes for a few minutes, and that's when the dream must have come.<eos> You're not gonna say anything?<eos> You haven't said a thing, and your hour's almost up.<eos> I don't believe you have nothing to say.<eos> I think it's because you're angry.<eos> Too choked with rage to speak.<eos> What is it that enrages you?
Hey, don't worry about it.<eos> - Um... Social Security number?<eos> - 32-17-25.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - My locker combination.<eos> Great.<eos> Mr Baskin?<eos> Mr Baskin?<eos> - Y-yes...<eos> Yes. - The personnel director will see you now.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> Art Tatum, the first show just started.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> First show just started.<eos> I got one table left.<eos> You hurry, you can get it.<eos> Go on in, tell them the Mayor sent you.
What time did you say you'd be here?<eos> Hello? Sorry, what apartment are the Mooneys in? It's a penthouse.<eos> Your name, please?<eos> - Brian Flanagan.<eos> - Are the Mooneys expecting you?<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> All visitors have to be announced, Mr. Flanagan.<eos> Mr. Flanagan, would you come in, please?<eos> - May I take your coat, sir?<eos> There'll be someone with you in a moment.
Well, I'll be goddamned.<eos> - What is it? - Here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Look at this!<eos> Is this beautiful?<eos> You are beautiful.<eos> - You have incredible eyes.<eos> You a collector? - No.<eos> Oh, a shrewd one at that.<eos> Well, I will not insult you by haggling.
Because I'm a New York cop.<eos> I got a backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars.<eos> I can't just go that easy.<eos> You thought she wasn't gonna make it out here and she'd come crawling back to you so why bother to pack, right?<eos> Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.<eos> Mind if we hear some tunes?<eos> Hey, that'll work.<eos> Don't you got any Christmas music?<eos> This is Christmas music.<eos> So your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms, the music comes up and you live happily ever after, right?
We never finished this conversation. I had an opportunity.<eos> I had to take it.<eos> No matter what it did to our marriage.<eos> It only changed your idea of our marriage.<eos> You have no clue what my idea...<eos> I know exactly what your idea of our marriage should be.<eos> Ms Gennero, I...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.
I had it in my purse.<eos> What am I gonna say to my father?<eos> Some of the money was his.<eos> Arthur!<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> I want you to phone Andre and tell him to find Officer Benson.<eos> It seems he has stolen some of Miss Colgate's property.<eos> I shall be at the airport.<eos> Janet, I am going to cover your losses.<eos> You and your father will get your $50,000 back, and I am putting you on the first plane out of here.
You know what they call him?<eos> The brave little girl.<eos> He's braggart from Madrid.<eos> You and I are Basque.<eos> -So was Pedro de Ursua.<eos> -No.<eos> Ursua was from Batzan Valley.<eos> He was French.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> The men love and respect you.
- Yes, thank you.<eos> - Dr. Alembert asked me to call.<eos> We have a slight scheduling problem.<eos> Aortic valves seem to be a particularly temperamental group.<eos> We wonder if you'd mind moving up, reading your paper tomorrow at 3?<eos> - No, no problem.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - We'li get your slides in the morning. - Right.<eos> Yes.<eos> And about the lunch at the Eiffel Tower would you like us to pick you up or can you get there on your own?
I want Daddy!<eos> Oh, come on, Kirsty.<eos> Grow up. When you're dead, you're fucking dead.<eos> Don't be naughty, Kirsty, or I'll have to punish you for it.<eos> Huh? Perhaps you'd like that, huh?<eos> Now, would you like that?<eos> Oh, don't be shy, beautiful. Ghosts aren't jealous.<eos> - This is my hell. They're here to tease me.<eos> - Take me! They promise forever and never deliver.<eos> - That's why I sent for you, Kirsty.
Very unhealthy at your age.<eos> Will you sleep?<eos> I thought it would be you.<eos> Want to come in?<eos> No one's here.<eos> Everything in good order?<eos> You look terrific.<eos> Don't you know how to fight?<eos> Why are you peeping at me?<eos> Because I love you.
I work at the post office.<eos> You besiege me, you bring the milk you send me false notices... you send gas workers, you pinch my letters.<eos> But it doesn't really matter.<eos> Haven't you any friends?<eos> One, but he's not here now.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's with the UN Force in Syria.<eos> I lodge with his mother, opposite. He's different from me.<eos> I think so.<eos> He peeped at you, too.
He'll be out in a few days.<eos> I'd like to visit him.<eos> He just left my place...<eos> I know.<eos> I think that... I have hurt him.<eos> Don't visit him, he will be back.<eos> What happened?<eos> You'll probably find it funny.<eos> He fell in love with you.<eos> He watched you through this.
In that same bar, at the same time, almost one year ago.<eos> On that day I passed the exam to the lawyer's profession.<eos> If I was more careful then...<eos> You're too sensitive. It's not fit for this job.<eos> Now it is too late...<eos> Yes.<eos> Today, you have aged a little.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> The warden will see you in a minute.
(in French) Where do you go, brother?<eos> I didn't know I have a brother!<eos> Where do I go?<eos> Who knows!<eos> You are a foreigner.<eos> I can show you the way.<eos> What?<eos> It is God that puts you on my way, I am certain of it.
Mamma, go quick!<eos> There is no sign of him.<eos> He is long gone.<eos> His mother lives across the street, she will not talk to us.<eos> I want the whole area covered.<eos> Someone must have seen something.<eos> - They will not talk to us.<eos> - Then shake it out of them.<eos> What?<eos> All these white guys chasing around with their notebooks will get you nowhere.
Eva. Eva. That's me.<eos> - Cocktail hour.<eos> - Drink for Mr. Richard Burton. - Drink up.<eos> - Here, Dave.<eos> Drink just for me.<eos> For you, Dave.<eos> That Dick sure knows how to live!<eos> Why do you keep calling me Dick?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Burton.<eos> Maybe we don't know you well enough to call you Dick but after Exorcist II and Night of the Iguana, we thought we had something special.
-What`d I do?<eos> -You touched him.<eos> You don`t touch a Hasidic rabbi unless you`re his wife.<eos> -Are you serious?<eos> -No. l`m making it up.<eos> lt`s halakah. lt`s the law.<eos> -l should apologise.<eos> -l wouldn`t do that.<eos> Just leave.<eos> He won`t see you again.
YOUR LIFE<eos> My glasses.<eos> - Look at his ears.<eos> - Oh, he's so cute.<eos> A bit pudgy, huh?<eos> That's when you fell from the balcony.<eos> It wasn't the trailer that should be heavier... It was me who should be weaker!<eos> One only has to top his adversary! It's a battle of the giants...<eos> And then you arrived.<eos> Your friend even kissed you before she got out.
A man in prison had a watch like this.<eos> His name was...<eos> - Breton.<eos> - You're the son he talked about.<eos> I had to pull quite a few strings, use friends in high places to get him out.<eos> You think he'd be grateful.<eos> When he found out... he threatened to kick me out of the house.<eos> Called me a collaborator.<eos> Then he had a heart attack.<eos> - What brought you here?
Fucking-A!<eos> 45 minutes.<eos> Must be the only fucking phone I've ever met that don't... .<eos> Get in there!<eos> -Vallenari's.<eos> Good evening.<eos> -Hi, this is Dale McKussic.<eos> Mr. McKussic, I'm sorry.<eos> It's a little noisy in here.<eos> Aren 't we seeing you this evening?
And you couldn't catch me if I was.<eos> Try the sand dabs.<eos> Try the sand dabs.<eos> Here, look. Watch!<eos> That's terrific.<eos> You know, I just... ... thinksomething'sgoingon.<eos> I'm still a detective even when there's no crime.<eos> What do you think's going on?<eos> Something you don't want me to know.<eos> How are we treating you this evening, Mr. McKussic?
I'll drive.<eos> I go dance.<eos> -No, you're going home.<eos> In the course of last night... ... somethingcameup which persuaded me...<eos> ... thatMacdininginthat place is a non-drug related activity.<eos> He won't get away with what he's done for 1 5 years and just retire.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> I suggest you make sure we have a case.<eos> After all, what are friends for?<eos> We haven 't seen you in a while.
He'll take care of you until this is over.<eos> Ready to fire.<eos> All you care about is arresting Mac.<eos> Get inside.<eos> Don't smoke.<eos> I got a leak in the fuel line.<eos> Everything's set.<eos> No, Carlos is still at your house.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Now I recognize you.
Repeatedly.<eos> They're probably talking about me right now.<eos> Subtitled by GELULA CO., Inc.<eos> The government swears you're doing business here.<eos> I'm not.<eos> And you couldn't catch me if I was.<eos> Try the sand dabs.<eos> What do you think's going on?<eos> You don't want me to know.<eos> How are we treating you tonight?
Now noone is going to protect you.<eos> Your name will be ruined.<eos> Talk!<eos> Ching Han!<eos> Coming out soon.<eos> Get a doctor.<eos> Kam, burn up this false stuff.<eos> What is it?<eos> Les go!<eos> The only way to save yourself is for you to tell us who's blackmailing you.
DaiMon Bok.<eos> You can see him.<eos> They're communicating on visual.<eos> Open hailing frequencies.<eos> Frequencies open, sir.<eos> This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.<eos> We are transmitting visually.<eos> Is this the Capt Picard?<eos> - Do we know each other?<eos> - I know you, Picard.
- What is this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Sounds like you.<eos> - It is!<eos> - I refuse to believe you said that.<eos> I must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster.<eos> Unfortunately, I fired our main phasers and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel.<eos> I assume they simulated your voice.<eos> I already put Data to work on it.<eos> I never made that log entry, but it leaves you with a duty to perform.
Dear Miss Hanff:<eos> A note to let you know that your gift parcel arrived safely today.<eos> Mr. Marks and Mr. Cohen insisted that we divide it up among ourselves... and not include the bosses.<eos> Everything in the parcel was something we never see... or can only get through the black market.<eos> It was generous of you to think of us and we are extremely grateful.<eos> - How did she order it from Copenhagen?<eos> - Heaven knows.<eos> Best wishes for 1950.<eos> Yours faithfully, Frank Doel, for Marks Co.<eos> - Can I help you?
It's a crisp 22 degrees.<eos> The President elect has just entered his limousine.<eos> Hi. So, it's a cold day in Washington, but the people say the new President's hot.<eos> Stay tuned for later details and the President's wife.<eos> She's coming down.<eos> - Let's go. - I guess we better get into action.<eos> - Good morning, Mrs. Craig.<eos> - Who are you? - My name is Killian, ma'am.<eos> - Don't call me "ma'am."<eos> I haven't seen you before, have I?
- The President's ordered us home.<eos> - Especially you.<eos> - The hell with that.<eos> It's my belief that somebody just tried to kill you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You're overreacting.<eos> What happened down there was a tragic accident.<eos> It's not the first time a boat's blown up while taking on fuel.<eos> A gasoline-powered boat, yes, but your boat was a diesel... and they don't explode without some help.<eos> They're sending you in a helicopter back to Washington.
Wait a second, are you trying to melt that iceberg?<eos> Charlie, consider who she is.<eos> Mister.<eos> Mister, did anyone ever tell you... that your wife looks sort of like the President's wife?<eos> Her head is big enough without any help.<eos> Greyhound again?<eos> - You ever ride a motorbike?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I don't think $6,000 is such a bargain for a pair of used bikes.<eos> They'll never look for you on one of these.
Your best suit.<eos> What'll they say at the restaurant?<eos> What's gotten into you boys?<eos> You think it's funny?<eos> Was everything all right, Mr. Meyer? Thank you.<eos> The rabbit was tolerable.<eos> Mrs. Quentin, your table's this way.<eos> François, sit over there.<eos> Julien here.<eos> - We haven't seen you lately.
Glad to meet you.<eos> You certainly have a beautiful home, Miss Swail.<eos> You bet.<eos> Can the Beaver come out and play?<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Will I ever see you again, Joe?<eos> Absolutely. You're our main witness.<eos> We'd like you to come downtown, take a look at the mug books... see if you can make a positive l.D. on the man you saw.<eos> I'll have a policewoman come here tonight, keep an eye on the house... and bring you downtown to Parker Center tomorrow.
The disease doesn't frighten Dr. Mesmer.<eos> Which medicament lies hidden in his doctor's bag ?<eos> - What has he in mind to prescribe ?<eos> - Aspirin and rest.<eos> You haven't a chance, Mesmer.<eos> You wouldn't be able to stay alive out there for one single day.<eos> The air is infected. And the soil.<eos> And the water.<eos> early one morning you leave the protected walls of our city.<eos> Your courage has brought you this far, Dr. Mesmer.
Give me a way out.<eos> That's easy, I find you a scapegoat.<eos> And frame him instead.<eos> Now tell me who start it?<eos> Go back to your seat.<eos> You, come with me to the wash-room!<eos> Sir, want to talk?<eos> Who's the boss here?<eos> Step out!<eos> Sir, I won't follow you to the wash-room.
Part of the device.<eos> This is artwork.<eos> This is goddamn artwork.<eos> This is real pro stuff.<eos> I haven't seen anything like this since the war.<eos> The CIA used to hire mercs. They used the exact same setup.<eos> Mercury switches, gaflooey!<eos> That's heavy shit.<eos> We got something.<eos> The detective wants to see you.
Clive.<eos> Get a pillow. Kitty, a pillow.<eos> Ada, brandy.<eos> - Mother. - What is it? - Fan him.<eos> - Oh, Morrie, what is it?<eos> Oh, fan, fan, fan. Fan him.<eos> It's all right. Silly to -<eos> - Oh. - Uh, all right. I'm all right.<eos> Uh, I'm all -<eos> Certainly not. Maurice is going to carry you. Oh.
England has always been disinclined... to accept human nature.<eos> I have not told you the whole truth.<eos> No, Mr. Hall?<eos> Since I was here, I... went wrong...<eos> I'm terrified he may blackmail me. Apparently, he's quite smart enough to do so.<eos> I have an idea that's what's stopping me from going into a trance.<eos> He sent me a letter, you see.<eos> Read it.<eos> "Come to the boathouse.<eos> I have key and will let you in."
- Knock on my door! Knock next time!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Did you see anything?<eos> No, I didn't see you playing with your dolls.<eos> Good.<eos> President Skroob.<eos> I told you never to call me on this wall!<eos> This is an unlisted wall.<eos> Sorry, sir, but it's very important.<eos> The princess is in your office and Lord Helmet is awaiting you there.
- I don't know.<eos> Capt Picard wants you to beam up.<eos> Our new Captain doesn't waste time.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> - Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Enterprise, this is Cmdr Riker at Farpoint Station.<eos> Standing by to beam up.<eos> Lt Yar of Security, sir.<eos> Capt Picard will see you on the battle bridge.
- I need the cufflink.<eos> - Fuck the cufflink.<eos> What you're asking me to do is absolutely illegal.<eos> Will you let your client fry because you wanna play by the rules?<eos> No, I would do anything for him.<eos> But I'm not gonna break the law.<eos> All right.<eos> If he did it, I'm gonna vote guilty.<eos> But if he's innocent, I don't want that on my conscience.<eos> Miss Riley, I wanna see you in my chambers.
And as for the other two girls... well, surely you can find... some sort of husband for them.<eos> If that doesn't appeal to you... send them to the Carmelite Sisters.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> I'll kill that pig!<eos> I'll arrange everything with my friend the governor.<eos> Da Silva... we have a special assignment... which we can entrust only to a capable man.<eos> This is an official certificate entitling you to practice... the slave trade.<eos> As you know, this trade has fallen into stagnation.<eos> The King of Dahomey has cut off our supplies... but we know he needs weapons and money.<eos> So, we propose the following :... we will send you to our Fort Elmina in Dahomey.
I have a brother who was in Germany in the service.<eos> Munchgstettner...<eos> You travelling' by yourself?<eos> You got an airplane ticket? Is it a round trip?<eos> Do you mind if I have a look at it?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, everything seems to be okay.<eos> You plan on to stay long?<eos> Someone plan on joining you?
And she didn't wait?<eos> Strange girl.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Out of the way, dopey!<eos> Jesus...<eos> - That was amazing.<eos> - Mind over matter.<eos> Old bushman's trick.<eos> All right, Miss, all ashore.<eos> Now I'm gonna leave you in Mick's capable hands, and I'll meet you at the Echo Billabong on Wednesday.
Oh, hell, the dogs are out.<eos> Mick?<eos> Nice to see you again, Miss.<eos> Mr Mason.<eos> Nice to see you looking so fit and well.<eos> Simpson, Mr Dundee.<eos> Nice to meet you, Simo.<eos> - Call me Mick.<eos> - Mick!<eos> Your father's expecting you.
Yesterday he shut himself in the fridge.<eos> Fancied himself an Arctic explorer!<eos> You little moron!<eos> Go downstairs, I'll open up a bottle.<eos> I insist.<eos> You did me a favour.<eos> Darling, what did he do to you?<eos> Ever hear about the three supermarket witches?<eos> A great story.<eos> I'll tell you.
Another bottle of champagne and fritters.<eos> -Fritters for two?<eos> -Yes, for two.<eos> You'll eat for three.<eos> I'm going for a pee.<eos> Are fathers really the last great adventurers?<eos> And did I look like an adventurer?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I've been watching you.<eos> I've got something that may interest you.
- Uh-huh. - Don't you got just five minutes to talk? - No, I don't.<eos> - Come on, Jack.<eos> - Just come up and make it short, all right?<eos> Fatso's on his way up here.<eos> Cover up the merchandise.<eos> Just take this, in case he's gotten any smarter lately, all right?<eos> Hi, Jack. Where you at?<eos> Hi, babe.<eos> She nice.<eos> Jack, I know how you feel about me... after what happened down in Jefferson Parish... with that spy boy, and I don't blame you one bit. But you too serious.
Mr. Peterson?<eos> I think I owe you an apology, sir.<eos> -Well, I should say you do.<eos> -l... I, I, I...<eos> Well, I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake.<eos> A family member dies and you insult me.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you anyway?<eos> Well... I really don't know, sir.<eos> I mean, I didn't think I was talking to you. I thought I was talking to somebody else.<eos> You know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you like that. I... I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.
Hush, come over here.<eos> This is the right one, over there is the left one.<eos> - So what?<eos> - Look, sir.<eos> Here is a concrete-lined hole, just to avoid digging it over again.<eos> Farmers bring a pale, sir, and a malefactor is impaled.<eos> Afterwards, the pale is put in the hole and it's standing.<eos> And the malefactor rides it deeper and deeper by his own weight.<eos> Hell, what a ceremony!<eos> Sir, the whole stadium will be watching you, while you're high up there.
They take me to account for satisfying the heroes.<eos> This is my duty.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll do it for you.<eos> I am very pleased.<eos> Thank you, sir, thank you.<eos> No, no need, it's very close, round the corner.<eos> You know, the ceremony is getting close and I always get the shivers from there to here.<eos> You may laugh at me, but I fell really moved when I envision you up there in convulsions, while I'll be watching.<eos> I'll get me binoculars and I'll be watching you, watching until you breathe your last.
You will follow my program to the letter.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> We go into combat tomorrow, you'll plant half those men.<eos> You did it on your own, didn't you?<eos> I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.<eos> You make it easy.<eos> Sir I gave Gunney permission to freelance his I mean, the men, sir.<eos> Wait outside, Ring.<eos> Aye, aye, sir.<eos> I'm going to run you out of the Corps, Highway.
- Yes, we are.<eos> - Knock it off.<eos> Here. Here's a special fund.<eos> Gunnery sergeants only.<eos> Don't worry, you can pay it back.<eos> - Here. You better take him. Jesus Christ.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What are you smiling at?<eos> - I always knew you were Santa Claus.<eos> You pull another suckhead play like that the only thing that will beat you to the brig is an ambulance.
You throw a new coach with newfangled ideas at 'em, might get 'em all confused.<eos> We'll ease into it real slow. Hell, our first game's less than two weeks away.<eos> First of all, let's be real friendly here, OK? My name is Norm. Secondly, your coaching days are over.<eos> Look, mister, there's... two kinds of dumb.<eos> A guy that gets naked and runs out in the snow and barks at the moon, and, uh... a guy who does the same thing in my living room.<eos> The first one don't matter, the second one you're kinda forced to deal with. Translate.<eos> That some sort of threat?<eos> I don't know why Cletus dragged your old bones in here.<eos> He must have owed you something fierce.<eos> The fact is, mister, you start screwing up this team, I'll personally hide-strap your ass to a pine rail and send you up the Monon line.
I don't want this to be the high point of his life. I've seen 'em. The real sad ones.<eos> You know, most people would kill to be treated like a god, just for a few moments.<eos> Gods come pretty cheap nowadays, don't they? You become one by putting a leather ball in an iron hoop. I hate to tell you this, but it's only a game.<eos> Why so unfriendly, Miss Fleener?<eos> Well, I know men like you.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know you're here.<eos> I know this place doesn't even appear on most state maps.<eos> A man your age comes to a place like this, either... he's running from something or he has nowhere else to go.<eos> What I'm doing here has nothing to do with you.
- Exactly!<eos> If there's water under this rock, I'll reach it in two weeks.<eos> But if it's under the Quaternary layer... it'll take six months or more.<eos> Now I know what a ditchdigger's thirst is.<eos> This hits the spot!<eos> Monsieur Jean, I have to be frank with you.<eos> You may think this is none of my business... but I feel sorry for you.<eos> All the work you've done for the past two years--<eos> It's madness.<eos> It'll kill you.
This is no life for you, and that's the truth.<eos> Go on.<eos> This is all very interesting.<eos> A man like you belongs to the city.<eos> You're educated. You could be a teacher... or even a mailman with a nice neat outfiit.<eos> That's what you're meant for.<eos> If you stay here, you'll kill yourself.<eos> You're out of money-- that's no crime.<eos> But you're skimping.<eos> Eating rabbit and dandelion leaves you too weak for this work.
Do you know a relationship of that kind, with a monkey, perhaps?<eos> No, nothing specific.<eos> That would be quite an event.<eos> Microphones could be installed in this woman´s bedroom.<eos> Even a camera... with her permission, of course.<eos> It´s a guaranteed best- seller.<eos> Could a woman have a child with a monkey?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I know for sure.<eos> Well, Roger, thank you so much.
Monster!<eos> At least have the grace to kill me before you dishonor me!<eos> Cap'n, can't you see?<eos> He doesn't care two coppers for his niece!<eos> - Let's have his eye out! - No!<eos> Aye, there's a pretty notion!<eos> Let's take a peek at 'is brains!<eos> Spare him, I beg you!<eos> I will give you my jewels... all my jewels!<eos> I implore you, for the sake of the mother that... bore you in her womb!
Bullshit.<eos> Would I lie?<eos> You really...<eos> Really what?<eos> No way.<eos> Look, dude, I saw it right there in front of me.<eos> I poked at it with a stick.<eos> No chance.<eos> Poked at what? By the river?<eos> Tony, we'll take you there and we'll show you.
- They'll be flown to Alaska.<eos> - They'll be released there.<eos> - That's the last you'll see of them?<eos> See, yes. But we'll tag them with special transmitters and monitor them.<eos> I could take those whales somewhere where they'd never be hunted.<eos> You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.<eos> If I'm so inept, how come we're having dinner?<eos> I'm a sucker for hard-luck cases.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you "Admiral".
Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.<eos> Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.<eos> You're giving her wrinkles.<eos> - You see?<eos> Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.<eos> I'll make you 20 years younger.<eos> Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.<eos> Would you like to be Surgeon General?<eos> I know simply everybody.<eos> They won't know you when I've finished with you.
- No, no.<eos> Last night was fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> More than fine!<eos> Terrific!<eos> I was talking in general.<eos> Well, in general, I think we're having a great time!<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Will you still love me when I can't keep up with you?<eos> Of course. I love you now, and you can't keep up with me.
I am Miss Millie!<eos> I'm the mayor's wife!<eos> I've always been good to you people!<eos> I've always gone out of my way for coloreds!<eos> Miss Millie, whas the matter?<eos> Those boys tried to attack me.<eos> No such a thing.<eos> How could you leave me alone for so long?<eos> What am I gonna do about the car?<eos> Jack will drive you home, Miss Millie.
Just a minute.<eos> I'm not finished yet.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Underhill. Does that look like I'm finished? I guess not.<eos> Now I'm finished.<eos> Whatever you say, Mr. Underhill.<eos> I imagine you're expecting a nice gratuity, right?<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> Gail Stanwyk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't seen you since the wedding.
A guy called Jack Forrester.<eos> He killed his wife.<eos> I saw it on TV.<eos> He allegedly killed his wife.<eos> That means he's gonna get away with it.<eos> So, how do I look?<eos> Weird.<eos> - Good morning, madam.<eos> - 'Morning.<eos> Mr. Forrester is expecting you.
Yes, I know, he told me.<eos> I was hoping you'd reconsider.<eos> I didn't kill my wife.<eos> - I didn't ask you if you did.<eos> - Lf you represented me, you would.<eos> I'd ask about the case they had against you.<eos> I'd want to win my case.<eos> Did you win all your cases when you were a prosecutor?<eos> Yes, I won every one.<eos> Is that why you wanted me to represent you?
"Dear Jack:<eos> "I've been trying to reach you all week.<eos> "I'll be at the Canyon in Palm Springs.<eos> "Wouldn't it be fun if you came down?<eos> "Isn't it silly to keep avoiding me?<eos> "Page will never know."<eos> How is it signed, Mrs. Howell?<eos> "Love, Ginny."<eos> Your Honour, may I show this to the jury?<eos> Mrs. Howell did Mr. Forrester meet you in Palm Springs?
There's nothing on my record.<eos> I wasn't fired.<eos> I left.<eos> During the course of your intimate sexual relationship with Mrs. Forrester where did you have sex with her?<eos> Motels. The house in Hillsborough.<eos> - Down at the beach house.<eos> - The house in Baker Beach?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Where the murders took place.<eos> Did Mrs. Forrester ever pay you for having sex with her?
Keep going.<eos> I knew we'd hook up again, Colton.<eos> Get it?<eos> I swear to God!<eos> My right hand to God!<eos> Come on!<eos> I am dead, Miss Wilder.<eos> All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.<eos> But I will not be alone.<eos> Who is going to save you now?
Help... what a bastard.<eos> Help.<eos> Miss.<eos> You scum, right under the sun.<eos> No, right in the open...<eos> - But she...<eos> - No need to explain.<eos> Are you alright, Miss.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Don't be afraid, I'll take you home.
We're not asking her.<eos> According to law, she has to do it.<eos> Inspector Chan!<eos> Your job is to protect Miss Fong until she appears in court.<eos> Me?<eos> Protect her?<eos> Why not?<eos> Great!<eos> I don't need his protection.<eos> As long as he doesn't harass you, you can't refuse.
Fuel, if you want.<eos> It's a generous offer.<eos> Why me?<eos> You've got warriors, weapons.<eos> Give the order.<eos> We are dealing with subtleties here.<eos> This is no enemy.<eos> It's almost family.<eos> I see, real civilized.<eos> The reasons don't concern you, just the conditions.
You know, I have the feeling we've met somewhere before.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> Were you in Boston two years ago?<eos> No.<eos> Funny.<eos> How come an attractive woman like you ends up in a job so...<eos> Raunchy?<eos> Yeah. No, I mean dangerous.<eos> That's a long story. Maybe someday I'll tell you.
Put your hachimaki on.<eos> Remove the gag.<eos> If this is a demonstration of commando tactics, it's gone far enough.<eos> Tell the garrison to assemble out front to hear a speech.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> If you do, we will surrender our weapons after the speech.<eos> Stop playacting.<eos> I can't approve a speech until I've read it.<eos> If you try to stop us, I will kill you and commit seppuku.
Lt. Mészaros is not here to fall off his horse... drunk at 11 am. Contraband vodka, drunk at the Inn... where you go to keep warm, while your men train outside. And by noon you are kept in the saddle by their horses.<eos> We are not here to dishonour the Emperor's uniform... by making deals with civilians... like Kferrer and Halmi... getting involved in God knows what.<eos> We're not here to seduce a girl a week... meaning raping her in the woods.<eos> Like a poor servant-girl who dares not say a word... for everyone would believe the almighty officer. Almighty officers, indeed!<eos> Officers of the Monarchy... must set a good example so the people trust us... and know the Emperor will protect them.<eos> My question is, does the Monarchy... need each one of you personally... here in this garrison?<eos> Answer the question yourselves.<eos> If you think your presence here has a meaning... then you know that with your rights... you have certain obligations.<eos> Only then can you claim privileges. You need not be Imperial Army officers. The post office or the railways... guarantees a pension.<eos> Colonel Ruzitska wishes to see you in the conservatory.
I have bad news for you, Redl.<eos> When did you last see Mészaros?<eos> This afternoon, during the manoeuvres.<eos> - He has deserted.<eos> - Really?<eos> To the Russians.<eos> Tonight at six he appeared on the other side of the barrier.<eos> And shouted to our soldiers... "Say 'hello' to Mr. Ruzistka and Redl for me!" And then he did this.<eos> I've had enough of the Russians border.<eos> I'm applying for retirement. I'd like to recommend you as District Commandant.
What do you want to know from Kubinyi?<eos> If Ullman had any military diplomatic contacts.<eos> Tell me, Redl... are you a cruel man?<eos> Imperial Highness, I am doing my duty.<eos> - What faith?<eos> - As I told you, I'm Catholic.<eos> - Do you like children?<eos> - Yes, but my wife is ill.<eos> Excuse the questions.<eos> I just wonder why Roden always backed you.
- And you?<eos> We go back to New York tomorrow.<eos> It's been a refreshing two weeks.<eos> We could bring him to meet the Countess.<eos> She loves a pith helmet.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I will say it's tempting.<eos> It's settled.<eos> You can explain what we've been looking at for two weeks,...<eos> - ... and we can take you nightclubbing.
That's all.<eos> Thank you, Captain Vinh.<eos> Leave one guard, please.<eos> I see you are no stranger to pain.<eos> Perhaps you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before?<eos> No answer?<eos> Do you wish to give your name?<eos> What possible harm can that cause?<eos> Pride is a poor substitute for intelligence.<eos> What you must understand is that we must interrogate you.
But for me you are a comrade, similar to myself, just opposed by an act of fate.<eos> I know you were trying to facilitate the release of war criminals.<eos> But this incident, your capture, is embarrassing.<eos> We must have an explanation.<eos> Radio your HQ and say that you have been captured and condemned for espionage, and that attempts like these should not be made in the future, or they will meet with the same fate as you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You wish to test your strength...<eos> Good.<eos> Yushin!<eos> Comrade, here is something that might be of interest to you:
Why did you pick her?<eos> I don't pick 'em. I just grab what comes along.<eos> Miss?<eos> He's a captain now.<eos> I had forgotten he had picked up some stripes.<eos> So how's my friend Lorenzini?<eos> He's a friend of my husband.<eos> I've never met him.<eos> You're not missing anything.<eos> So what brings you here?
Who are you?<eos> This is Mr. Jessup, whose name isn't really Jessup.<eos> He says he's from Palm Springs, but doesn't have a tan.<eos> You're not wired, are you?<eos> is this my package?<eos> Look okay?<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> When do I get delivery?<eos> How about Friday night?<eos> If I don't hear from you by Friday I'm coming back to get this.
Frankly, I don't think you can beat the case in court.<eos> Because I represent Masters I can't get deeply involved in your case, -if you see what I mean.<eos> -So, what should I do?<eos> You beat them to the punch with the U.S. attorney and you make a deal.<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> You offer to plead guilty and to testify against your partner.<eos> The fbi's not gonna want a lot of publicity on this.<eos> I suspect they'll go along with a guilty plea.<eos> How much time would I have to do?<eos> I could probably get you off with seven years.
Mr St John Smythe.<eos> Allow me to introduce myself.<eos> Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.<eos> - A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You will excuse me?<eos> I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.<eos> Your stables are magnificent.<eos> Built in the 1 6th century by a duke who believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.<eos> Have thoroughbreds interested you long?
I have the Progeny Index on the computer:<eos> a compilation of thoroughbred bloodlines.<eos> Might be helpful to you in selecting your purchase this afternoon.<eos> As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding.<eos> A stallion sounds right to me.<eos> I find a computer indispensable.<eos> I have a stallion.<eos> Descended from that horse there.<eos> Misty.<eos> We have several horses that might interest you.
- That was a terrible tragedy, but I hardly knew Ronnie Chang.<eos> Ronnie Chang represents much of what is bad in Chinatown.<eos> We are trying hard to get rid of this element.<eos> My sources say you have returned from Bangkok.<eos> Was there a business purpose?<eos> I have interests there.<eos> I import foods from the Far East.<eos> I also have a company that distributes films in Thailand.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Would this business take you into the jungle 500 miles north of Bangkok, to meet with a reputed drug lord by the name of Ban Sung?
Sometimes more, sometimes less...<eos> In this heat we can not have the dead ones lying here that long, can we?<eos> - I want my holidays.<eos> - What?<eos> Holiday.<eos> I'd be entitled by now to a year and half.<eos> You're really something!<eos> Eight week will do for me.<eos> We make it five, don't we?<eos> And I'll find someone to replace you.
In the course of conversazione... they said they wanted a country cottage... and did I know of one?<eos> A simple burrow they could call their own... where they could smell the earth.<eos> Of course, London has its own character. But we've a longing for green things growing.<eos> Don't we, George? The sweetness of the English countryside... of... of wet hedgerows... with birds singing inside them.<eos> Of course I freely admit it's a weakness. We should make our heaven on earth wherever we are.<eos> However, I fear I've faltered and need some help from outside.<eos> Yes, uh, well, uh... in short, sir, what I seek is a country cottage... a little home for me where George could come at weekends.<eos> Well, I happen to know of just the place for you.<eos> Not exactly a cottage. More... a villa.<eos> Oh, dear sir, I implore you...
- I can't.<eos> - No discussion.<eos> Go, please.<eos> I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.<eos> You don't mean you're going to marry that man?<eos> You're being ridiculous.<eos> Oh, I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.<eos> But he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman.<eos> He doesn't know what a woman is.<eos> He wants you for a possession, something to look at... like a painting or an ivory box. Something to own and to display.
Would your mother spare you again so soon?<eos> Well, she must spare me. I simply must go away.<eos> I have to.<eos> Don't you see I have to go away?<eos> Charlotte! Isn't it too romantic? The Miss Alans are going to Constantinople.<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> So far only to Athens.<eos> I've always longed to go to Constantinople...<eos> Athens, I mean.<eos> In lieu of Constantinople, could not Minnie and I lure you to tea at the Beehive?
Well, I mustn't miss the train.<eos> The removers can do the rest.<eos> - Oh, I...<eos> - No. I don't want you straining your back.<eos> I won't be down at the weekend.<eos> I'll come to take you back to town the week after.<eos> And paper soap is a great help... towards freshening up one's face on a train.<eos> But you know all about these matters. And you have Mr. Vyse to help you.<eos> A gentleman is such a standby. We think it's so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you.<eos> But perhaps he will come out and join you later.
Well, it's out in the sticks.<eos> I know you deserve more.<eos> But you know I've been sidelined these past 3 years. And from this "exile" I owe to certain friends, I no longer have a say where the police are concerned.<eos> However, I've found new friends and that injustice will be redressed.<eos> And if I get a certain job, my authority will count in many circles.<eos> So I advise you to accept.<eos> It's lovely here.<eos> It reminds me of when I was a boy back home.<eos> You were already a legend.<eos> You know what they called you?
What's going on?<eos> Wait, we must talk.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Those witnesses...<eos> They've decided to talk in the interests of justice.<eos> And you'd do well to go back home.<eos> Now it's serious.<eos> - What's going on, sir?<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> Judge Bordonaro wants to see you immediately.
I wish I did not desire you so, but I do.<eos> Since that night I suffer continuously...<eos> It has never happened to me before.<eos> My nights are pure insomnia.<eos> Since I arrived here, I have only been happy when looking at you... always surrounded by other men, flirting before my eyes.<eos> Looking at you provokes feelings I hadn't felt since childhood.<eos> But at that age, we know nothing of passión.<eos> - only you know my secret.<eos> - Be quiet!<eos> I cannot help you.
-I know.<eos> -How do you know that?<eos> -Well.. I don't know, I thought...<eos> -Don't worry, madam, it's not your fault.<eos> -I came to get my things and to pay my rent, here...<eos> -Madam? -Yes?<eos> -Can I ask you something before I say goodbye?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Why is your husband following me?<eos> -My husband follows you?
"So Jonas... "in the middle of a love scene,<eos> "would make daring comments "on his partner's breasts,<eos> "or proposition her... "during a take.<eos> "Jonas, who was a gentle person, "was shy with women in real life, "became a lion in front of the camera."<eos> He says,<eos> "They were deaf people "who could lip-read Jonas' obscenities.<eos> "Silent films were better because... because..."<eos> Slow down, Sylvain.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Miss, I watched you all night.
And, Barney, may God forgive me.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Barney Dunn.<eos> You know Barney Dunn.<eos> Barney Dunn.<eos> I can't hear ya.<eos> Barney Dunn was the world's worst ventriloquist.<eos> If they couldn't get an animal act, they would call Barney Dunn.<eos> Barney would work children's parties. Five-year-old kids would boo him.<eos> Two weeks ago Danny, who doesn't handle Barney... that'll tell you about Barney, Danny didn't wanna handle him...
But I'm not going along.<eos> - I'm not going.<eos> I'm not going!<eos> - Carmen, my love, you are coming.<eos> And you won't have the heart to leave us in the lurch.<eos> I'm not going, I'm not going!<eos> But tell us why, Carmen.<eos> Why, why, why!<eos> Why, why, why!<eos> Of course, I'll tell you why.
Lieutenant...<eos> I've decided to crush Sultan Omar on his own ground.<eos> Behind the border?<eos> Borders are nothing but lines on a map.<eos> And we decide where to draw them.<eos> Now that Mekalla is with us, we might as well put an end to all dissidence and insure our hold on that area for good.<eos> Does the government approve?<eos> In a democracy, you can act without the government's approval, on one condition:<eos> if public opinion's behind you.<eos> That's where you come into play. I'm sending you to Paris.
- You're looking good.<eos> We're in a real fix.<eos> What should I do?<eos> The church won't take any position on the religious implications.<eos> Personally, I think it's a sign from God.<eos> - But don't quote me on that.<eos> - That's a smart move.<eos> I won't call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.<eos> I've only been with the company two weeks, but I have to tell you, these things are real.<eos> I have seen shit that'll turn you white.
- Human sacrifice, mass hysteria!<eos> Enough, I get the point!<eos> But what if you're wrong?<eos> Nothing happens!<eos> We go to jail, quietly. We'll enjoy it.<eos> But if I'm right, and we can stop this thing you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.<eos> I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men.<eos> - Get him out of here.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - I'll fix you, Venkman.
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.<eos> Afraid the facts mixed up.<eos> Are you calling him a liar?<eos> No call no one nothing.<eos> What are you here for, old man?<eos> Come ask leave boy alone.<eos> Can't the boy take care of himself?<eos> One-to-one problem, yes.<eos> Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.<eos> Is that what's bothering you, the odds?
Come in here a minute.<eos> What's up?<eos> Ask the Judge.<eos> The Judge?<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Maybe I should go with you.<eos> No, I can handle it.<eos> I hope so.<eos> - I'm Roy Hobbs.<eos> - Yes, the Judge is expecting you.
THIS IS A TAPE OF THE SESSION THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU IN MY LETTER.<eos> I'VE INCLUDED A FILE ON THE FAMILY,<eos> WHICH WILL HELP TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THEIR BACKGROUND.<eos> AS YOU'LL SEE, THERE'S A GHOST MEMBER THAT I'M DEALING WITH HERE:<eos> A SON WHO WAS GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION.<eos> THOUGH THE SHAPE OF THE ABSENT CHILD PLACED A STRESS ON THE FAMILY'S EQUILIBRIUM, THIS SESSION PROVED QUITE EFFECTIVE<eos> I HOPE YOU FIND IT HELPFUL.<eos> WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR DAUGHTER LEFT HOME?<eos> -BECAUSE SHE DON'T RESPECT ME, THAT'S WHY.<eos> -WHY DO YOU THINK SHE DOESN'T RESPECT YOU?
ABOUT BEDROS?<eos> ARE YOU SORRY THAT HE'S NOT HERE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS?<eos> ARE YOU ANGRY WITH AZAH BECAUSE SHE REJECTS THE VALUES YOU BELIEVE YOUR SON WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED?<eos> YOU GAVE YOUR SON AWAY WHEN YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY.<eos> -WE HAD NO MONEY.<eos> -SO YOU GAVE HIM AWAY.<eos> A FEW YEARS LATER, YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.<eos> YOU KEPT HER.<eos> SHE'S IN THIS ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW.<eos> DOES THAT UPSET YOU?
Yes, sir.<eos> How are you, sir?<eos> This is Lt. Harris from the police academy.<eos> I'm so sorry, sir...<eos> Just one moment.<eos> Hi, Capt. Reed, can I get out of here?<eos> No?<eos> Okay.<eos> I tried.<eos> Capt. Reed, thank you so much.
What was the intention?<eos> Because if work has no intention, it's not work at all.<eos> It's an empty motion.<eos> Well, what would you call washing dishes?<eos> For me, this is a religious experience.<eos> Hey, let me try that.<eos> Yeah, I feel it.<eos> Kind of like being in church.<eos> Pass me the soap, will you, bishop?<eos> I could take you to a better church.
Martin, I've been practising.<eos> How's this?<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Is your daughter 18?<eos> Your papers, please.<eos> Mr. Nick Rivers.<eos> We have been awaiting the arrival of the famous American singer.<eos> - Where are they taking him?<eos> - They are not taking him anywhere.<eos> Do not let your American curiosity lead you into trouble.
Based on the novel by Peter Rosei<eos> Screenplay Hans Broczyner<eos> Director Michael Haneke<eos> You don't know me anymore.<eos> But I've known you since you were a small child.
This morning the Foreign Secretary said he had no definite news to report and that it would be unhelpful to speculate without any hard information.<eos> There's been a run on tinned food, sugar and other storable items, which is causing shortages in some areas.<eos> A spokesman for the main supermarket chain said panic buying is unnecessary.<eos> Fuel shortages are hindering resupply in some areas, but there is no shortage of stocks.<eos> They urge the public to calm down... 40p? !<eos> That's scandalous.<eos> They were only 26p last week.<eos> Shop somewhere else if you're not satisfied.<eos> There's a national emergency and you're lining your pockets.<eos> Nobody's forcing you to buy 'em.
What a little turd.<eos> Percy, you see how the King picks me out for special greeting?<eos> - No, My Lord.<eos> - I saw it, My Lord.<eos> Ah!<eos> And what is your name, little fellow?<eos> Baldrick, My Lord.<eos> Then I shall call you...<eos> Baldrick.<eos> And I shall call you "My Lord", My Lord.
Your guards will not allow me to leave the console room.<eos> They have their orders.<eos> If I'm to die, I want to prepare myself mentally.<eos> For that I need to be alone.<eos> Which is the nearest room?<eos> My companion's.<eos> It has already been searched.<eos> Then you may withdraw.<eos> But be sensible, Doctor.<eos> If you try to lose yourself in the corridors of the Tardis, my men will hunt you down.
There will be no eating or drinking.<eos> Is this clear?<eos> What the hell's gyo?<eos> It's a Japanese cure for laziness.<eos> Laziness, Jesus Christ!<eos> Why don't you listen?<eos> He means spiritual laziness.<eos> And he believes... that if he takes away the food and the water, then he also... takes away the nourishment for the laziness!<eos> You don't believe that bullshit, do you?<eos> I don't fucking know! Sir, I will tell you something that may surprise you.
See.<eos> Are you happy now?<eos> Do you think she's all right?<eos> Oh, you poor dear...<eos> Oh great!<eos> Just great!<eos> What am I going to do with this thing?<eos> No, no way.<eos> Not her!<eos> You can go into the examining room. The doctor's waiting for you.
A bad habit I haven't been able to break since medical school.<eos> I used to practice in front of a mirror.<eos> Listen, Doc, will I be able to keep my job at the construction company.<eos> Sure, you needed the pacemaker years ago when you had excess weight.<eos> Now it's just a booster.<eos> Believe me, you can do everything you could 15 years ago.<eos> Believe me, I can do better than that.<eos> Here are the results, Dr Fool.<eos> It's Fool, Von der Fool!<eos> You do that once more and I'm sending you to intensive care, as a patient!
As a result of a corneal implant, his right-eye print is an exact replica of that of the president of the United States.<eos> He will soon be moved to a convalescent clinic near London.<eos> I have chosen Number 12 to have the responsibility of taking the most tenderloving care of Captain Jack Petachi.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> Is there no speed limit here?<eos> She's not staff.<eos> She must be one of those private nurses.<eos> My name is Bond.<eos> Oh, you're Mr Bond!<eos> I believe I'm having you in half an hour.
Yes. Some sacroiliac strain at the base of the spine.<eos> There is a more beneficial therapy for a man's lower back.<eos> - Oh, really? - Mm.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> I thought I'd... surprise you, James.<eos> Well, you have.<eos> Come in.<eos> No, no. I can't come in.<eos> You know if they found me here they'd fire me on the spot.<eos> I won't let anyone find you.
- Do you know him?<eos> - Oh, yes!<eos> 007.<eos> Good morning, Mr Bond.<eos> Miss Fearing tells me you're making fine progress.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> But I must say, you're looking a bit peaked this morning.<eos> - I was up all night.<eos> - Don't overdo it.<eos> A herbal enema should fix you up.
Right there.<eos> Oh, that feels so good!<eos> - Bonjour, monsieur. I am sorry, mademoiselle.<eos> We are so very busy today.<eos> - Where'd the masseur go?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The man, the masseur.<eos> - The man I pass?<eos> He does not work here.<eos> They'll never let you in.
It depends with whom I'm playing.<eos> Ja. Shall we?<eos> Join us.<eos> These are my friends. They honoured me by coming from all over the world to give money to my favourite charity.<eos> - And what might that be?<eos> - Orphan children. So... here we are.<eos> The game is called Domination.<eos> I designed it myself.<eos> But my problem is, I've never yet found a worthy adversary.<eos> No doubt I shall disappoint you too.
Good luck. Bond's clear!<eos> We're movin' in!<eos> There you are.<eos> I always have a martini at five.<eos> You'll never give up your old habits, James.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> Those days are over.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr Bond.<eos> Obviously caught you at a bad moment.
- Yes?<eos> I... I'm Lila Loomis.<eos> I used to be Lila Crane.<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Well, what a coincidence.<eos> I was just thinkin' about you and sam.<eos> How is he?<eos> My husband is dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, what brings you back to Fairvale after all these years?
Punch a hole in the sky.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Oh, just about right.<eos> There she is, partner.<eos> All bridled, saddled and ready to go.<eos> You got any Beemans?<eos> Yeah, I got a stick.<eos> Loan me some.<eos> I'll pay you back later.
He'll be going after Crossfield soon, won't he?<eos> No, he won't.<eos> He'll be going after that demon that lives in the thin air.<eos> You got any Beemans?<eos> Even before you hit Mach 2, she'll be unforgiving on you.<eos> So take it easy. Wring her out a little bit this time.<eos> You got any gum?<eos> Yeah, I got me a stick.<eos> Loan me some.<eos> I'll pay you back later.
These are men who will have to face any danger for their country.<eos> No individual will have ever been so adequately prepared for an event.<eos> Each man knows that whoever survives this competition is destined to become a legend in his own time.<eos> Here, hold this.<eos> And hold this like this.<eos> When the clamp is released, the balloon inside you deflates.<eos> Deflates?<eos> Where's the john?<eos> Two floors up.<eos> Gonzalez will take you there, but wait here with him.
And some of them are they're still out there somewhere, doing what they always do.<eos> Going up each day in a hurtling piece of machinery putting their hides out on the line hanging it out over the edge pushing back the outside of that envelope and hauling it back.<eos> But there was one pilot I once saw who I think truly did have the right...<eos> How close did you ever come to not hauling it back?<eos> Who is the best pilot I ever saw?<eos> Well, you're looking at him.<eos> You got any Beemans?<eos> I might have me a stick.<eos> Loan me some.<eos> I'll pay you back later.
Chief Detective, Narcotics.<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> I think we should talk.<eos> Talk?<eos> What are we going to talk about?<eos> I ain't killed nobody, not lately.<eos> No, not lately.<eos> What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?<eos> Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?<eos> Whoever's giving you your information is taking you for a long ride.
Just sign.<eos> How is Raquel Welch in reality, flesh to flesh?<eos> - She's gonna last forever.<eos> When there's anything you need...<eos> - I mean anything.<eos> - Anything?<eos> Anything!<eos> We have some ivory statues.<eos> Oriental statues... (Woman speaks in Dutch) ...from gorgeous delight in the basement.<eos> Those tiny fingers will work you up, slowly, slowly, to an excitement you've never had before.
We're going to see some terrific new things. We are.<eos> Would you please, if you will, hold it down over there?<eos> Sorry, I can't hear you.<eos> Hold it down!<eos> Have some respect for other people's feelings!<eos> Come over a little closer.<eos> Hey, you in the bush, I can't hear you!<eos> I'm sorry, but I just took a sauna, and it's real hard not to yell when you hit that cold water.<eos> You're not gonna ignore me when I speak directly to you?<eos> I'm not ignoring you.
Oh, the farm!<eos> That's out of town somewhere.<eos> That's where they keep them.<eos> Oh, but that's enough talk about me.<eos> Let's talk about you.<eos> -How'd you like me in the first act?<eos> -I thought you were sensational.<eos> Oh!<eos> Flatterer.<eos> -I bet you have girls chasing you.
[PHONE RINGS]<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Siletski.<eos> Hello, Colonel Erhardt.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Thanks for sending the plane to Sweden.<eos> The train takes forever.<eos> Oh, yes, yes.<eos> I have the list.<eos> Good, 1 0:00 tomorrow at Gestapo headquarters unless I hear from you.
I was on a talk show with your father.<eos> So it was to be you after all.<eos> You've come to kill me. No.<eos> No, I'm Max Renn.<eos> I run Civic TV.<eos> I don't...<eos> - I don't kill people.<eos> - Oh, but you do.<eos> You're an assassin now for Videodrome.<eos> They can program you. They can play you like a videotape recorder.
- Massoulier's been killed.<eos> - l know.<eos> - These idiots suspect me. They want to detain me.<eos> - lt's their right, but...<eos> - l think I was denounced. - Denounced?<eos> - Not exactly, but accused by a loony anonymous phone caller.<eos> - Did you tell them?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - What do you want here?<eos> One day, I'll find you in my bedroom.
(in unison): Look!<eos> Delbèque!<eos> It's the same name.<eos> - l can't figure it out.<eos> Why would the major stockholder of a nightclub... work as a cashier in a crummy cinema?<eos> It's vital that I talk to her.<eos> - Don't be crazy!<eos> All the cops have your picture.<eos> Let me go!<eos> - You can't handle it. Besides, she knows you.
Because my children feel it.<eos> Because of the marks on my body. They're in places...<eos> I can't do it to myself, even in a dream.<eos> Why does he attack you, Carla, not anyone else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I suppose he chose me.<eos> - Chose you?<eos> Why?<eos> I suppose he finds me attractive.<eos> Would it be a reflection on you as a woman if he left you?
Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> There are no ceilings anywhere in the house. That's for the television monitoring.<eos> Except, of course, in the bathroom.<eos> There is a ceiling, but no plumbing.<eos> We'll supply you with all the water you need.<eos> That's a chemical toilet.<eos> - Does this look familiar?<eos> - It's a good simulation.<eos> Remember not to change in here.<eos> The television camera will be watching you.
Just turned my son-in-law out.<eos> How?<eos> Knocked him on the head.<eos> And who's speaking?<eos> Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!<eos> Meet you?<eos> All right!<eos> Hey, man with a mustache!<eos> Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?<eos> I've been watching you for a long time, by the way.
..they also have Bambi and Pinocchio<eos> - No, the duck's ok!<eos> My mother embroidered it Ah, sorry!<eos> It's for you, Melandri.<eos> I'm sorry for them, they always want to be funny....<eos> - Today is a merry day.<eos> - God helps,..<eos> ..happy people.<eos> - Come,..<eos> ..don Angelo, I dress you up.
Why did you ask me to do your play?<eos> The play I wrote is a serious play written in a comic mode, all right?<eos> It requires an actress that's gonna bring intelligence and truth to it.<eos> But at the same time she has to be funny, she has to act like a ditz.<eos> Ditz.<eos> Now, I know you haven't had much stage experience, Ms. Detroit.<eos> You've had some and Morris Finestein's the best director with actors.<eos> He's the best.<eos> He's...<eos> He'll work with you.
I'm dreadfully sorry, but the matter is out of my hands.<eos> The nursing staff have no authority over the kitchens.<eos> However I'm sure things will be back to normal quite soon.<eos> 18 seconds for 78-A and 78-B.<eos> - Now what does that give us?<eos> - 43 minutes.<eos> 42 minutes, 38 seconds.<eos> That leaves us 5 minutes and 22 seconds for the final component.<eos> Yes, nurse?<eos> Professor, Sister would like to see you in Intensive.
Don't go near my daughter.<eos> Don't try to see her.<eos> Don't write and don't phone.<eos> Can I use her underwear to make soup?<eos> - Get out!<eos> - Mr Altfeld by helping me, your daughter's life is in danger.<eos> But she may save hundreds of lives.<eos> You wouldn't stand in the way of that.<eos> Why certainly I would!<eos> I'd frame you or kill you... if it would protect my daughter.
His mother is Russian.<eos> He speaks the language and is the same size as Voskov, who the suit and cockpit are fitted for.<eos> You mean this is reduced to the decision that he fits the suit?<eos> You want me to risk resources for somebody who's never been on an intelligence mission who's subject to seizures.<eos> Delayed stress syndrome is common among our vets.<eos> It manifests itself in civilian life, not battle conditions.<eos> - This is suicide.<eos> - That's exactly why it'll work.<eos> It's too unthinkable for them to ever defend.<eos> We'll get you on that plane.
You should wait in line, Mr. Lewis.<eos> You've been most uncooperative.<eos> - Well, I'm sorry...<eos> - About what?<eos> Let's see what we have here.<eos> We don't want to delay you unnecessarily, do we?<eos> No.<eos> You're staying at the Warsaw Hotel?<eos> Wonder if we should call them?<eos> See if someone there knows you.
The fuel lines to the second prototype must catch.<eos> So you'll have only a few seconds.<eos> When you hear the alarm, come down immediately.<eos> Ignore what you see in the hangar.<eos> Just get your plane out.<eos> A fire is not very predictable.<eos> It's past 12:00.<eos> Natalia and I don't have to report until 2:30, but you must go by 1:00.<eos> Here are the coordinates that you must feed into the inertial navigator.<eos> They'll put you in contact with a commercial flight from Moscow.
Follow them!<eos> My weapon...<eos> Look out, over there!<eos> I'll take care of the other one!<eos> I'll get you... you!<eos> - MK-1 Anton, please respond.<eos> - Yes, boss?<eos> Report an unexpected exitus.<eos> 26, 27, 28...<eos> Now they're having you in their grip, Lieutenant.
This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.<eos> Just give me a name.<eos> Please.<eos> Just...<eos> That's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you for telling me.<eos> Ed.<eos> Ed.<eos> The ambassador is waiting for you in the ballroom.
Port?<eos> A small port would be perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you live alone in the castle?<eos> Of course not.<eos> My husband is away for the weekend with the children.<eos> I was meant to meet them... but this stupid breakdown means I won't get there until tonight.<eos> I won't delay you further.<eos> I'd better go.<eos> Can I drop you back at your car?
You have a deal, Major.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> I was wondering if you would care to join me.<eos> The pheasant in this part of the country is extraordinary.<eos> Cooked with wine and sage.<eos> You must be starved.<eos> Well?<eos> If you're thinking of using that knife on me, don't.<eos> - And if I did?<eos> - That man out there would shoot you.
Prepare for docking.<eos> I hate inspections.<eos> I'm delighted. Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.<eos> I am glad to have you at the helm for three weeks.<eos> I don't think these kids can steer.<eos> Open the airlock.<eos> - Permission to come aboard, Captain.<eos> - Welcome.<eos> You know my training crew.<eos> They certainly know you.
- Khan!<eos> - You still remember, Admiral.<eos> I cannot help but be touched.<eos> I, of course, remember you!<eos> What is the meaning of this attack?<eos> ! Where is the crew of the Reliant?<eos> Surely I have made my meaning plain.<eos> I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral.<eos> I've deprived your ship of power and will deprive you of your life!<eos> But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you.
He's insecure.<eos> I have to be tough.<eos> He just wants my body.<eos> Dorothy, you're so bad.<eos> - You look just the way you look.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're very attractive too.<eos> I want you to meet my dad, Les.<eos> - It's nice to meet you.<eos> - I feel I know you already.
We're outta time.<eos> See if there's somebody on this list to replace Gruber.<eos> Well, there's Dr Thompson.<eos> He's the nearest.<eos> Dr Thompson.<eos> Yeah, Frank Galvin, representing Deborah Ann Kaye.<eos> We had some correspondence.<eos> Uh, well, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, but... the case got postponed.<eos> I had to reorganise my staff.<eos> I'm sorry to call you so late.
- From the hospital?<eos> Well, there's no records since she quit in '76.<eos> She quit two weeks after the incident.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I have to talk to you.<eos> I can't talk now.<eos> Call the AMA.<eos> Tell 'em you're Dr Somebody and you need to find a nurse... get some forms, somebody's dying.<eos> Mrs Costello?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you this late, but this is Mr Goldberg in Accounting.
I wrote a one.<eos> You didn't write a nine, you... wrote a one.<eos> And how is it that you remember so clearly after four years?<eos> Because I kept a copy.<eos> - I have it right here.<eos> - Objection!<eos> We can't accept a copy when the court already has the original.<eos> I'll rule on that presently.<eos> Please, proceed.<eos> What in the world induced you to make a photocopy of an obscure record... and hold it for four years?
Tonight, I am happy and honored to have with us one of the great entertainers of our time.<eos> The toast of Paris, Victor!<eos> Perhaps Victor will honor us with a song.<eos> Give us a G with your left hand, Sid.<eos> Something I wanted to do all my Iife.<eos> -Me harmony. -Okay.<eos> walk this way.<eos> -Taught him everything he knows.<eos> -That's why he has so little left.<eos> I'II get you for that.
- Well, I'm sorry to have to say this. But I have to tell you, I don't have faith in yourjudgment.<eos> I'm sorry that you feel that way.<eos> But I guess there's nothing we can do about that.<eos> No, I'll have to disagree with you again, Miss Long.<eos> That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.<eos> Now, would you excuse me?<eos> I have a great many things to do.<eos> Miss Long, when will Jerry be back?<eos> Mr. Langford won't be in until very late this afternoon.<eos> Mr. Pupkin, we mean what we say when we thank you for stopping up.
Kassia?<eos> Where's Kassia?<eos> Melkur!<eos> This mustn't be discovered.<eos> It is too soon.<eos> (CHATTERING)<eos> Yes, indeed, this is a very serious matter.<eos> Do they understand?<eos> One can never tell with strangers.<eos> Doctor, the consuls now transfer you to the custody of Tremas.
-Hello.<eos> -Hello.<eos> -How do you feel?<eos> -Oh, fine, fine.<eos> It's always nice to be reprieved.<eos> You didn't notice a tall blue box with a lamp on top out there, did you?<eos> There was nothing like that there.<eos> I know that Tardis, Tremas.<eos> It's got to be out there somewhere.<eos> Very well, I'll take you there myself.
Sergeant McManus, ... . . are you suggesting that David and Jack were attacked by some animal, ... . . and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret?<eos> We've an autopsy report on the murderer, shot in the act by the local police.<eos> We have two witnesses to the crime.<eos> You'll forgive me, Mr Kessler, if I consider your testimony... . . as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.<eos> Inspector, the boy seems all right to me, and...<eos> And what, Sergeant?<eos> -And I don't rightly know, sir.<eos> -That is precisely my point.<eos> David, as far as we're concerned, the matter is now closed.<eos> We will trouble you no further.
-David, please!<eos> Shakespeare's French!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Shit!<eos> Cunt!<eos> Shit!<eos> -Come on, that's enough.<eos> -David, please!<eos> -Who is this person?<eos> -If you don't stop, I shall arrest you.
- The cooling system is leaking.<eos> - Tighten the seals down there.<eos> Give me that shoring. Take it, quickly!<eos> It's flooded down here.<eos> Get me the biggest one.<eos> That's the biggest we can find.<eos> Higher!<eos> - Where do we put him?<eos> - Easy, men.<eos> Captain, the chief's looking for you.
Sory about that. We can't all be gi_ed.<eos> # If eveybody's somebody<eos> # Then no one's anybody<eos> - Put my friend here down as well.<eos> - Steady on.<eos> Splendid!<eos> Rehearsals start on Monday. Iolanthe.<eos> - l was a boy alto.<eos> - Pe_ect! You can be Queen of the Fairies.<eos> Where were you when your county needed you?
Yes.<eos> - Is she coming?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - To dinner?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Her kid brother is athletics-mad. Always talking about me!<eos> Monty, you'd better have my glass.<eos> I've a terrible feeling you're going to need it.<eos> Sory, Monty.<eos> Yes, thank you vey much, sir.
Different name, different shipyard.<eos> He disappeared from sight.<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> Shit, these are strong!<eos> I don't know the guy, but I think he's playing some sort of game.<eos> I wrote about his father in 1970, maybe I'll write about him now.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> - Excuse me...<eos> - No, my fault...<eos> We won't let you in until radio and television stop lying.
I hope your car's there when you get back to it.<eos> It won't get far without petrol.<eos> The Red Army has scored huge successes against the Germans, striking back with tanks and troops along the Eastern Front.<eos> Hitler's armies have suffered many humiliating defeats and have fled, frozen and in disarray, through the killing snows of Russia.<eos> All this at the very moment Hitler was saying that the word "surrender"<eos> is not to be found in the German vocabulary.<eos> The US and British Forces have stepped up their daylight bombing of Germany.<eos> Mr Churchill and General Eisenhower are in conference and with the approach of summer, an attack by the Allies on Europe is, of course, only a matter of time.<eos> The fatal question for the Nazi command must be where and when will the invasion take place?<eos> A U-boat will pick you up off the coast of Scotland, but only when you signal it.
- No, no.<eos> Billy.<eos> Morning, ladies.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's all right.<eos> - What's the matter with you blokes?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Look, I always wanted to join the Light Horse.<eos> Infantry not good enough for you...mate?<eos> Well, if that's how you're gonna be, I'll see you when I see you.
Ladies can bring their jewellery, dance with their lovers, then introduce them to their husbands.<eos> Are you married, Detective?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was.<eos> Three times.<eos> Apparently I'm boring.<eos> Please take a seat.<eos> It is strange that we've troubled you... on New Year's Eve.<eos> We just need to clarify some details, especially concerning the dog.<eos> Mrs Martinaud isn't expecting you?
I know, I'm sorry.<eos> Dr. Rogers is just afraid this could jeopardize our whole rehabilitation program.<eos> He doesn't want anyone from the Mental Health Department anywhere near Haddonfield.<eos> Why did he send you down here then?<eos> In case you'd already found him alive.<eos> Tell Dr. Rogers...<eos> Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.<eos> I can't leave Haddonfield now.<eos> I'm afraid you don't have a choice.<eos> There's a marshal waiting for you outside.
Lili!<eos> There she is.<eos> We want to take some pictures. Please move back.<eos> We've been looking for you everywhere. The group-leader invited us to the Adlon. He wants to celebrate your success.<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> Does that mean you turn me down again?<eos> I'll get you an aspirin.<eos> I feel miserable. I have a bad headache.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My chauffeur can take you home.
Soldiers! Friends!<eos> This is a very happy day.<eos> Today we celebrate the birthday of the man always in our thoughts, the man who will guide our people to the final victory.<eos> Our beloved Fuhrer and chancellor, Adolf Hitler.<eos> Three times "Sieg Heil"!<eos> Tell her to come back on! Get her back!<eos> Where has she gone?<eos> Do you know where Willie is?<eos> No idea.<eos> He asks if you realise the danger if the film is found on you.
Are you just putting up with this?<eos> You usually put up a fight.<eos> Nothing.<eos> This is the photo from our contact in Zurich.<eos> What's the name?<eos> Mendelsson.<eos> Very interesting.<eos> Okay, leave it to me.<eos> Group-leader...<eos> You will return to Berlin tomorrow. They're expecting you.
What's the name?<eos> Mendelsson.<eos> Very interesting.<eos> Okay, leave it to me.<eos> Group-leader...<eos> You will return to Berlin tomorrow. They're expecting you.<eos> Does that mean my tour has finished?<eos> We would have liked to keep you longer. But some things are more important.<eos> What do you mean, some things are more important?<eos> I was asked to send you to Berlin without delay. As far as I'm concerned... that's as good as an order.
- And you?<eos> Me?<eos> I am very corrupt.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Let's just say I adjust to the situation.<eos> That's the same thing, isn't it?<eos> Now, before you find out who I really am, I'd better say goodbye.<eos> What a pity.<eos> Your bus is coming.<eos> It'll bring you back to town.
- Headache? Then Lola can get married within the next three days.<eos> Because she will be clean within in the next three days.<eos> And then you will buy this salon from me. And then you can make the jokes.<eos> Do you want to sell?<eos> If you give me a good offer, right away.<eos> Not right away.<eos> But later. Maybe.<eos> Shall I tell you a little secret now that everything's been arranged? Please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Well, I knew about you even before you came here, and then, after I met you,
You have a lotto carry.<eos> This is proof of your guilt, Mr Schuckert.<eos> Oh, come on, Mr von Bohm, we should talk this thing over.<eos> Oh, that's what we should do?<eos> I've nothing to say.<eos> Well, it is of general interest, what you have in mind, and...<eos> Please let me through.<eos> There must be a way.<eos> What I have in mind?<eos> I can tell you that I'm going to destroy you.
- What is your name?<eos> - The question's odd, for someone who idle talk despises. Who, far removed from worldly show seeks only academic prizes.<eos> With you, one knows your game generally by your very name.<eos> It's evident, Sire, if one's called a liar.<eos> Who are you? I'm a part of that force that always craves evil and always creates good.<eos> What is this riddle?<eos> I'm the spirit who negates. And rightly so, for all creation is worthy of annihilation.<eos> So it were better nothing were created.<eos> And so everything you've stated is sin, destruction, devilment. Remains my actual element.<eos> Good evening, Herr Höfgen. The Prime Minister invites you to his box.
What you got?<eos> You know we can't come back here again, you know that?<eos> - Bitch.<eos> - All the time...<eos> What is this?<eos> Let's get back to headquarters.<eos> Don't litter.<eos> - You littered.<eos> - So arrest me!<eos> Our mutual contacts insisted that I see you today.
- Right here.<eos> I just got these latest transfer orders...<eos> Don't sing me no operas today.<eos> I don't feel good and I'm rushed.<eos> I'm not singin' any operas.<eos> I'm talkin' about these transfer orders.<eos> Look, come on, Munafo.<eos> For nine years I've been workin' decoy.<eos> Now I'm pulled and I'd like to know why.<eos> Look, you don't know me well enough to call me Munafo, but I know you, DaSilva.
We've got a response on your request.<eos> I'm trying to keep my composure and like everything else I do, I think I'm messing this up.<eos> I despise these message things. I'm just such a coward.<eos> I couldn 't look at your face and say what I'm about to say. Ijust couldn 't.<eos> If you were in front of me, I'd change my mind.<eos> What?<eos> How bad?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Marshal, he's in the west wing.<eos> Sergeant Montone is waiting for you.
Don't look at me like that, stupid!<eos> Captain, we're 3 hours from the garrison.<eos> Should we go back?<eos> We're going on.<eos> The men may eat their rations.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Installed in the opera box the General told his orderly to wake him at the end of Act I, so he could applaud.<eos> Act I ended, but the General snored on! The orderly was asleep, too!<eos> The dashing Captain. Tireless as ever.<eos> We haven't seen you in 3 days.
And prolific: poems, criticism, short stories. At least a dozen novels.<eos> His father-in-law always said... "He doesn't do the writing.<eos> My crazy daughter does." "All he does is dictate!"<eos> The Major is relentless.<eos> Many writers would do better to have their books written by their wives or maids.<eos> Doctor, come quickly!<eos> She hasn't been down in nearly 3 weeks.<eos> They say she's never been this bad.<eos> Yes, she's suddenly got much worse. Like the food at this table!<eos> I must talk to you of a matter that concerns you.
It's my first duel. I hate those foolish duels that end with a scratch.<eos> One of us won't leave the field.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> At 7 am, at the old castle.<eos> I'll provide the weapons.<eos> My cousin mustn't know of this duel.<eos> If you don't tell her, she won't know.<eos> This silly duel could have been avoided.<eos> Your attitude was a kind of provocation.<eos> Of course, I'm indirectly responsible for what happened. Ever since... I encouraged you to go to Fosca's room.
No because that would have prevented me answering all your questions.<eos> - How many vials did he take with him?<eos> - Two.<eos> What procedure have you devised for contacting him again?<eos> It's all in my report.<eos> I suggest it's more economical to fill in my successor.<eos> We don't feel there is a need for a successor.<eos> I've completed my job.<eos> Brilliantly.<eos> That's why we want to rehire you.
And nothing can stop me.<eos> I know you can't wait to run off and make a fool of yourself and I'm here to help you.<eos> I'll look after Bob.<eos> Give me your sweater.<eos> I loathe you, Marge.<eos> You're still full of belief, Mark.<eos> I love seeing you miserable.<eos> It's so reassuring.<eos> Shit, Marge.<eos> Mr Zimmerman will be with you in a minute.
Doris Frederiksen?<eos> Yes.<eos> Inspector Rosen, from the savage squad.<eos> Someone is planning to kill President Njala.<eos> I thought I'd warn you.<eos> How does that concern me?<eos> Let's say you're the president's weak spot.<eos> The killer will try to get to him through you.<eos> In case he contacts you, try to keep him there, and call me immediately at this number.<eos> Two of my men will follow you for a few days.
I'm not asking you to take a message!<eos> I'm asking you to put the Minister on the phone!<eos> Let me speak to the Minister, Miss!<eos> You're something else!<eos> It took you French three revolutions and five republics to achieve some semblance of democracy, and you want me to achieve it in one day!<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't want to hear all this chatter about ethics, morals and comparative history.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> You see?<eos> Even your cleverness won't save you now!
No time to argue.<eos> Throw the idol, I throw the whip.<eos> - Give me the whip!<eos> - Adiós, señor.<eos> Adiós.<eos> Dr Jones, there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.<eos> And you thought I had given up.<eos> You chose the wrong friends.<eos> This time it will cost you.<eos> Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq.
Jones, do you realise what the Ark is?<eos> It's a transmitter.<eos> It's a radio for speaking to God.<eos> And it's within my reach.<eos> You want to talk to God?<eos> Let's go see him together.<eos> I've nothing better to do.<eos> Uncle Indy!<eos> Come back home now!<eos> Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you.
That's right, isn't it?<eos> Yes, we are very comfortable up here.<eos> So, once again, what was briefly yours is now mine.<eos> What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.<eos> You'll be a permanent addition to this archaeological find.<eos> In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - We must be going now.<eos> Our prize is awaited in Berlin.<eos> But I do not wish to leave you all alone.
Okay. You put her on the steps, and I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> All right. Bring the maid to the steps, and I'll come.<eos> You never did this...<eos> - Sergeant Rogers.<eos> - Rogers here.<eos> Doctor will be approaching the front step of the house. - Are you covering?<eos> - I've got it.<eos> I have all weapons trained on the area.<eos> Now, we have marksmen, and they'll be covering you every inch of the way.
What's that?<eos> Well... snakes can't stand the cold, you see, that's why it's in the duct, it likes the heat.<eos> So, if you were to put off the central heating, with any luck, he may go into a coma.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah? Report from the yard, sir, on the staff.<eos> The chauffeur's name is David Alfred Connelly, two years national service, no criminal record.<eos> - And the maid?<eos> - Louise Andrews.<eos> She's been employed by the Hopkins for eight months, excellent references.<eos> No criminal record, but this'll interest you, sir.
An ultimate thief's kit.<eos> Glazier's diamonds, a knife, and a set of master-keys.<eos> Objects born out of the progress of civilization.<eos> And here... Look.<eos> Look at this beauty!<eos> A thief's flashlight.<eos> I'm going to rob Milverton.<eos> I always told you I'd make a good thief.<eos> And I'm grabbing at this opportunity.<eos> But what if they catch you and arrest you?
Down!<eos> One moment,boss.<eos> Boys in two weeks.<eos> The wedding! Yes!<eos> I'm inviting You all! .<eos> One moment, boss!<eos> . I'm inviting You all!<eos> What's up?<eos> -Boss...<eos> I'd like to ask You for a favour... Please tell me if I ask You to be my best man will You come to my wedding?
Anyone who pays for ticket can travel.<eos> 20 dinars.<eos> How can you charge so much?<eos> What is much is much, really!<eos> Who wants, here it is, who doesn't<eos> - The road is free!<eos> Old man.<eos> Old man!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> - Conductor is calling you.
- That's not it.<eos> You love it, don't you?<eos> It gives you a thrill, like knocking over pencils and picking up papers.<eos> Get your scummy hands off of me. I've been straight with you.<eos> I put up with your pinching and staring and chasing me.<eos> I need this job...<eos> - ...but this is the last straw!<eos> - Let's just sit down and...<eos> I got a gun in my purse and, up to now, I've been forgiving and forgetting.<eos> If you ever say another word about me or make another indecent proposal I'm gonna get that gun and change you from a rooster to a hen with one shot!
My boss was brought in. Franklin Hart. Dr. Siedelman, line one, please.<eos> There we go.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> You blacked out.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I feel fine.<eos> I just fell off a chair and hit my head. That's all.<eos> That's quite a bump there.<eos> I think we'll take you upstairs for x-rays.
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.<eos> Very funny.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Want?<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> I can't stop my wife being a fool, but I can stop her from being blackmailed.<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You don't?<eos> The police think you're involved in a murder in Palm Springs.<eos> Three days later, you seduced my wife at a fund-raiser to blackmail me into helping you.
There's six men in the cell.<eos> They stick me with destruction of city property over $50.<eos> Felony number three.<eos> Habitual.<eos> - Judge gives you life for the toilet.<eos> - Yeah, or give me the toilet for life.<eos> Same difference.<eos> Anyhow, here I am, shoveling shit for dead men.<eos> Instead, how'd you like to be a trusty and run my motor pool?<eos> Mr. Brubaker, I been studying you since you first come in and it's come clear to me that you are one weird fucking individual.
- I'm looking into that.<eos> While we're at it, let's look into things like assaulting a doctor, firing a state employee who's been keeping the books for years.<eos> - Because he wasn't worth a-<eos> - Well.<eos> You're letting inmates take over the place, inmates with fourth-grade educations.<eos> They don't all have fourth-grade education.<eos> You're not gonna tell me that's gonna work.<eos> The point is these men have to at least feel like they're taking responsibility.<eos> They'll change this place, not me.<eos> - Well, what the hell are we paying you for?
- So...<eos> You can't just walk into some shrink's joint and start going through his books.<eos> You need a search warrant. And judges take a long time before they let you start snooping around some shrink's office.<eos> Of course, that wouldn't prevent a paranoid murder suspect from breaking in.<eos> You know, searching for some evidence to defend her case.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You want me to break in for you.<eos> I don't want you to do anything illegal.<eos> You can quote me on that.<eos> But I'm booking you tomorrow.
Dr. Elliott?<eos> You really are shy, aren't you?<eos> Liz!<eos> Behind you, Liz!<eos> So you had me followed?<eos> That's right.<eos> You've met Betty Luce, one of our best young police... persons.<eos> When I told you I was attacked on the subway, you thought I was nuts.<eos> Well, Detective Luce told me she lost you at Columbus Circle.<eos> I didn't figure there was another blonde following you.
I told you this would be a waste of time.<eos> Come over here a little while, will you?<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, yes, you, you.<eos> Full name, address, and occupation.<eos> But I am not the complainant.<eos> ~ No, you are the denounced.<eos> ~ Denounced by whom?<eos> By me.<eos> I denounce you for child neglect.
Yes, it does have an interesting past you don't try to buy too much with it today<eos> I learnt it... like the glory is not permanent<eos> But I respect your past and you must respect ours<eos> It too have a history and science, mathematics and medicine<eos> In your dark ages, we lead the world to learn<eos> How many days will it take you to arrange the surrender of your men?<eos> we will never surrender we win or we die and don't think that it stops there<eos> We will have the next generation to fight, and after that the next, and next<eos> As for me, I will live longer than my hang-man<eos> What makes you think I am to hang you?
Pleasantly surprised.<eos> Indeed! However the terms of the arrangement are not so harsh as you may think.<eos> You're a guest in my house and I will not be rude. But I would prefer if you said what you came to say and disposed of the matter.<eos> You speak your mind, don't you, Mrs. Errol?<eos> Very well. Your son's grandfather the Earl dislikes London. He's the victim of inflammatory gout.<eos> And intends to live for the most part at Dorincourt. Which is pleasantly situated in the countryside.<eos> Your son naturally would also reside there.<eos> The Earl offers you a cottage nearby.<eos> The boy will be permitted to visit you whenever he likes.<eos> The Earl will neither see you, speak with you or permit you within the gates of Dorincourt.
Mary isn't a servant. She was midwife to Ceddie when he was born.<eos> And has stayed on out of devotion although we could not pay her.<eos> She's all the family that Ceddie and I have.<eos> I see.<eos> You've not yet said whether you accept the Earl's offer and all the terms.<eos> My husband loved England. He loved his father.<eos> It grieved him that he was alienated from that.<eos> I will accept the terms.<eos> But only because I know my husband would wish it. And I think I believe it will be to Ceddie's benefit.<eos> Your son will thank you one day.
I see.<eos> I like you, Mrs. Errol.<eos> Would you come and spend Christmas with us at Lorradaile Castle?<eos> That's very kind of you. I promised Ceddie I would always be nearby.<eos> I understand.<eos> My mother's sons Maurice and Bevis were bitter disappointments to him.<eos> Wastrels enriching.<eos> Your Cedric, your husband, whom he loved.<eos> Cedric disappointed him too. By marrying me.<eos> My brother would be not be so prejudiced if he knew you.
Calm down, Ma'am.<eos> Yelling serves no purpose.<eos> Try to relax.<eos> What are you yelling about?<eos> They've killed him!<eos> It's a tragedy, a terrible tragedy.<eos> They'll kill us!<eos> You're upset.<eos> Try to calm down.<eos> Meg will accompany you to your room.
Bourbon on the rocks.<eos> That'll do her.<eos> No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.<eos> No charge?<eos> Your money's no good here.<eos> Orders from the house.<eos> Orders from the house.<eos> Drink up, Mr. Torrance.<eos> I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.<eos> It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance.
Come and get it, four-eyes.<eos> Now cool it!<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I just had this joint fixed. It cost me a fortune.<eos> This order's to go.<eos> I'm terribly sorry about all the damage, sir.<eos> I've been working out.<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. President.<eos> Sorry I've been away so long.<eos> I won't let you down again.
You realise, miss fuchs, that one mile of cars is over 250 cars?<eos> Are you aware that you've opened yourself up to a charge of perjury?<eos> What?<eos> I can produce a number of witnesses who will testify to the fact that she is lying.<eos> That she has, in fact, only 25 cars on her lot at this time.<eos> Why don't see for yourself, judge?<eos> Order!<eos> - I have no objection to that.<eos> - Neither do i.<eos> Miss fuchs, i'm gonna release you on your own recognizance.
Nice to me, she was.<eos> So nice.<eos> She was my friend.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Where'd you hear that song?<eos> From Jan. She was humming it at the pond the day she fell in the water.<eos> Come in, child.<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> I think you'll like it.<eos> - My mother said I was never to bother you.
I know you can't do a thing. You'll just make my coffee.<eos> You don't even know how to speak in the third person.<eos> No, Mr., and I don't want to be able to, either.<eos> All the better.<eos> May I ask something?<eos> Go ahead!<eos> Why don't you call me Celeste?<eos> I'm embarrassed when you say Madame.<eos> Because I can't.<eos> You want me to call you by your Christian name, though I don't know how to speak in the third person.
Stop, stop!<eos> Leave me!<eos> You can't die!<eos> Leave me alone<eos> Our god doesn't accept suicide!<eos> How does it look like?<eos> Don't you want to try to stay to your sins? And to beg for mercy?<eos> If you have no hope for normal live, than there is still the possibility to serve god as his slave.<eos> I know a very good nunnery.<eos> And god will definitely forgive you.
The manager's from Barcelona?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He's from Swanage.<eos> - And you're in 22.<eos> - What? You're in room 22.<eos> Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?<eos> Very nice stay, Mr Fawlty.<eos> Ah, glad you enjoyed it.<eos> Polly, would you get Mr Firkin's bill, please?<eos> When will we see you again?
Yes, that was them.<eos> Not much, they get less fussy as they get older.<eos> Sorry about this.<eos> It couldn't matter less.<eos> We're meeting in the morning.<eos> - You've had a long journey.<eos> - Get a good night's sleep. - Are you all right?<eos> - Fine, fine, just a little...<eos> Of course.<eos> You get straight to bed, we'll pick you up here at 9:30.
Obviously didn't pay its bill.<eos> Call me back when you've staunched it.<eos> I don't know why she stays with him.<eos> Oh, that's pretty.<eos> Hello, you got the guide.<eos> Good evening, Mr Johnson.<eos> Evening, any messages?<eos> Three, I think.<eos> Three?<eos> Everybody wants you, don't they?
- You'll be all right.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> - What about this guy here?<eos> - He says he's all right.<eos> It's a friend's car.<eos> I just borrowed it for the night.<eos> - How am I gonna tell him?<eos> - You should go to the hospital.<eos> - I'm okay, but the car ...<eos> - Let me take you to the hospital.
He said, Arthur Kirkland was the man to see.<eos> Okay, Ralph, tell me what happened.<eos> It says here you were involved in a robbery.<eos> No, sir.<eos> What happened is, it was time to come down on a nigger.<eos> It's like smoking.<eos> They've got to have a nigger every twenty minutes.<eos> What happened is ...<eos> I was in an alley, petting my dog, when they came down on me.<eos> It states here the dog was attacking you when you were seen in the alley.
When I get Fleming down I'm gonna crucify him!<eos> My client has no criminal record.<eos> He just wanted to take her money.<eos> It's the Super Bowl, Art.<eos> And I'm the quarterback.<eos> With three seconds to go, I drop back to pass and there's a touchdown.<eos> Fleming's carried out on a stretcher.<eos> It's that big.<eos> I find you guilty.<eos> But I'm not going to jail you.
Mr Kirkland asked me to handle this.<eos> You'll be out of here in a second.<eos> Do you have anything to say about this report?<eos> It's all right there in front ofyou.<eos> Well, I'm not satisfied.<eos> Ralph Agee, will you stand before the court?<eos> Stand up.<eos> On the basis ...<eos> And take off that wig.<eos> On the basis of this report, I sentence you to three years in the custody of the Department of Corrections.
A pen pal?<eos> That's Miss Sabine, his younger sister. Haven't you met her?<eos> Miss!<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> Pardon me, but are you Sabine Barnérias?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> - Please forgive me. I'm not Sabine, but you and I belong to the same sorority:<eos> Antoine Doinel's ex-girlfriends!<eos> I saw you at the courthouse the other day.
I do not want Ben disturbed.<eos> We have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man.<eos> Use any agencies that are necessary to get a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner.<eos> Have it in my office, tomorrow at 7:00.<eos> - I've got to take a leak.<eos> - Right, chief.<eos> Of course, your position in the financial community carries a lot of weight.<eos> But what caught Gary's interest was your down-to-earth philosophy.<eos> I see.<eos> Do you realize more people will be watching you tonight than all those that have seen theater plays in the last 40 years?
Just make sure we keep it out of the papers for at least 24 hours.<eos> There hasn't been a word yet.<eos> I think Roffe can handle it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I want us to get to the bankers in New York, before they hear what's happened.<eos> Mr Williams will be at the airport in 20 minutes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr Henley will be waiting for you at Kennedy.
-Cigarette?<eos> -What the hell happened?<eos> We don't know.<eos> The plane is missing.<eos> Not a word. Not a trace.<eos> -I can't understand Paul's actions.<eos> -I can.<eos> -Really, why?<eos> -It's not something I can explain.<eos> I'll contact you as soon as I hear anything.
We did.<eos> You confronted the man. How did he receive you?<eos> The inspector spoke with him.<eos> He was not impressed by my intuition.<eos> He heard us out politely, Reminded us how late it was, And then he suggested that it would be better if we left.<eos> You've been most careful not to mention the man's name, haven't you?<eos> I realize how persuasive sir charles can be.<eos> He came here. He threatened my husband in his own home.<eos> No. I can't expect you to break your word.<eos> Mr. Holmes, I have the strongest intuition concerning you.
No.<eos> I told-- I told annie chapman and they done for her.<eos> Did you tell polly nichols?<eos> Did you know poll? You told her, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> - She was with me often.<eos> They must have seen us.<eos> They?<eos> Who are they?<eos> Why are they looking for you?
Only death is certain.<eos> Only death is cruel.<eos> Death is cruelty against the unsuspecting.<eos> But that's not what I perceive as cruel.<eos> Cruel is when you can't die even if you want to.<eos> Give me some of your love which you give Jonathan.<eos> I never will.<eos> I won't even give that love to God.<eos> If Jonathan can't have my love then, no one else will.<eos> If I wish, he'll recognize you again.
A telephone, electricity.<eos> Look, sleeping pills.<eos> This sort isn't prescribed anymore.<eos> Where did they come from?<eos> Shall we go there?<eos> It'll soon be evening, too dark to get back.<eos> By the way, I can see that all this poetry reciting and walking around is a new, original way of apologizing.<eos> I understand you.<eos> A difficult childhood environment.<eos> But don't fool yourself. I don't forgive you.
-You saved the ship.<eos> -I'm aware of that, sir.<eos> Stop competing with me, Decker!<eos> -Permission to speak freely, sir?<eos> -Granted!<eos> Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years.<eos> That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes this mission.<eos> I trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties, mister?<eos> Yes, sir, I'll do that.<eos> Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.<eos> Forward motion, stopped, Captain.<eos> V'Ger.<eos> Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.<eos> It's directly ahead.<eos> That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its Creator.<eos> The carbon units will now provide V'Ger with the required information.<eos> Mr. Spock?<eos> Bones?<eos> Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes.
-What?<eos> -You don't close your eyes.<eos> Well, neither do you.<eos> These are the funniest buttons I ever saw.<eos> It's like it was some kind of costume.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Is the rest of this outfit as interesting?<eos> Amy.Amy.<eos> I don't want to compromise you.<eos> Are you certain I'm not forcing you--? Forcing me? My God, Herbert, I'm practically raping you.
- Eric.<eos> My husband, Eric Tilson.<eos> Anyone would think he'd had nothing to do with it.<eos> My dear, please don't distress yourself.<eos> These things happen.<eos> They always have.<eos> They're never the end of the world.<eos> Are you going to examine me or aren't you?<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You want us to examine you to confirm whether you're pregnant.
Nugent?<eos> - Yes.<eos> After my Great-uncle Nugent.<eos> He was a little pink man with tiny eyes and a snub nose.<eos> The resemblance is startling.<eos> Really?<eos> How very interesting.<eos> - Oh, Mr Herriot, if you only knew how excited I am at having a pig of my very own.<eos> I believe that.<eos> But what decided you..
I took a look at this lass.<eos> And I said... (Doorbell)<eos> - Hey, Worley, old love.<eos> If that's the wife, tell her I've emigrated.<eos> Anyway, she says to me, she says,<eos> "Were you on the bus on the way down?"<eos> Good of you to come out.<eos> - Not at all, Mr Worley.<eos> She's out back, as you know.<eos> She said, "I don't recognise you.
- And those are terrible breeches.<eos> What's wrong with them?<eos> - Wrong?<eos> Look at 'em!<eos> Well, they are just my working trousers.<eos> Well, I'll not have my staff looking like down-and-out hunger marchers!<eos> Sorry.<eos> - And as for that mac - looks like the leftover from a moth's banquet.<eos> Not fit to be worn by a veterinary surgeon, is it?<eos> I'm sorry if it offends you.
There's this new wonder drug on the market.<eos> It's just the thing for Percy's...condition.<eos> - l can't believe it!<eos> We obtained it especially for Percy.<eos> I shall give him a 10ml injection now, and you must give him the same in tablet form until further notice.<eos> If you'll just bring him over to the table.<eos> You really think it'll work?<eos> - lmprovement may be gradual.<eos> I think it's better on the table, Mr Partridge.<eos> I assure you, the results will astonish you.
I've got something you can put on.<eos> (Clinton ) Er...<eos> You'll find your gear in the back.<eos> There's nothing in the back, Mr Grier.<eos> Open the box, laddie.<eos> It's a calving outfit.<eos> I got it a while back.<eos> Just right for this kind of job.<eos> Pretty heavy, isn't it?<eos> A mite heavy, but it'll keep you grand and clean.
He's booked into the Reniston for the duration.<eos> The Reniston?<eos> What sort of student can afford to stay there?<eos> No ordinary one.<eos> Good morning.<eos> My name is Carmody.<eos> - Oh, Mr Carmody, won't you come in?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm Mrs Herriot.<eos> Mr Farnon and my husband are expecting you.
Er...<eos> Wilkinson.<eos> And good luck with Mrs Barker's Dinah.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Thanks!<eos> (James) Bye.<eos> (Knocking)<eos> Mr Herriot?<eos> - Yes, hello.<eos> Mr Bennet's expecting you.
That's not what you told me on the night of the murder.<eos> I know, but... I was lying.<eos> I wanted to protect my brother, but... ..what he did is too horrible.<eos> I have...<eos> - l think I have to tell the truth.<eos> - OK, Patricia.<eos> Go on.<eos> Andrew came running through the rain.<eos> We were surprised to see him.<eos> I remember he said something like "Hey, I was looking for you."
Doctor Josef Mengele was here tonight.<eos> You mean to tell me you call me at 3:00 in the morning... to tell me Dr. Josef Mengele is in Paraguay!<eos> I know that, Mr. Kohler. So does my sister. So does my landlord and my tailor.<eos> My congratulations.<eos> He came to a meeting at Gunther's house tonight and the others were there too.<eos> Mengele's sending them out to kill 94 65-year-old men... in the next two-and-a-half years.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Ninety-four at 65--<eos> Two-and-a-half years--<eos> I can hear you, Mr. Kohler. I just can't follow what you're saying.
I'm not in the house.<eos> I'm not here!<eos> I'm not in this world!<eos> I don't know him.<eos> How dare he?<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Tell him I'm dead!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I'm dead!<eos> Mr. Hermann doesn't know you.
I was sent here to identify a German agent, code name Nicolai.<eos> We are reliably informed... that he has infiltrated the People's Resistance Army, and is now known... as Capt. Lescovar.<eos> And having identified this man, what were your further orders?<eos> I was to eliminate him, sir.<eos> - Eliminate.<eos> Don't you mean kill?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I do mean kill.<eos> Do you hear that, Lescovar?<eos> The gentlemen from London want us to shoot you.
- Hey, leave your father alone.<eos> All this exercise is makin' me hungry.<eos> - Come on, Dad.<eos> All right, you won.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - You won.<eos> - No, you won.<eos> - No, no, you won.<eos> - No, you won.<eos> Mr Childress, telephone for you, sir... on the terrace.
I'm a deputy public health inspector.<eos> - Is this another call about imposters?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We're the first agency you called?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's good.<eos> Mr. Bennell, we don't wanna create a panic.<eos> No one in my department knows.<eos> I'm gonna ask you to stay by your phone for a while.<eos> I'll have somebody call you hack and take down everything.
He ran back down and called us.<eos> Any reason not to believe him?<eos> None I could see, but I'm checking him.<eos> - What about visitors?<eos> - He didn't have any.<eos> He had one tonight.<eos> - Zonfeld?<eos> - he never heard of him.<eos> Pick me up in the morning at 9.<eos> As soon as they'll let you in there.
You know it, the Prosecution knows it, I know it, the Judge knows it.<eos> It is not the Defendant who should be on trial here, but a besotted establishment who can cheerfully send a generation to slaughter in the name of war and yet has the audacity to bring a hapless fool like Lovelass to trial for uttering<eos> words.<eos> There was no crime, therefore there can be no sentence.<eos> My Lord.<eos> Some good points of course, but McKinley was the wrong man to give them to, especially in that way.<eos> He instructed the Jury. Got a verdict and passed sentence.<eos> It is plain that you deliberately sought to attack the law with violence.<eos> The only fit punishment is to remove you from society.<eos> I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of 9 years.
That is the end of this News Flash.<eos> Help me, Zonfeld, before I go mad.<eos> I could help no one that night.<eos> When I left those rooms I believed what I'd seen.<eos> When I got home I wasn't so certain.<eos> It seemed so beyond belief.<eos> Beyond belief.<eos> Yes.<eos> When I saw what I saw in that hospital I felt I had to tell you.<eos> I won't disturb you anymore.
- Sprechen ze deutche?<eos> Weiner schnitzel.<eos> Get in the backseat!<eos> What about me, Mr. Dixon? What about me?<eos> You...<eos> You...<eos> You go disguise yourself as a tomato and infiltrate their camp.<eos> Yes. Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Richardson to see Mr. Swann.<eos> Yes, sir. He's expecting you.
Excuse me, Amalia.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - It's officer Ciappi.<eos> Good morning officer.<eos> Doesn't your phone work?<eos> It doesn't work?<eos> Oh no, the handset is off.<eos> I know, when I went out I took it off.<eos> Because of my wife, if she would hear it ring she'd be disturbed... she is sick.<eos> The judge wants you at once.
Look at me, you must be wrong!<eos> - Oh no, I remember you!<eos> - yes, Mario.<eos> Marco also saw riding the bicycle.<eos> Yes, sorry, but I saw you, Orimbelli.<eos> Now I'm sure.<eos> - Now what will you say?<eos> - This is a plot...<eos> You know I'm innocent!<eos> I arrest you.
- But I'd never discuss it.<eos> Someone's been spreading an idiotic story about me.<eos> It can't have been done maliciously.<eos> Mr. Zimmermann?<eos> Good day Mr. Zimmermann.<eos> My name is Raoul Duplat.<eos> You don't know me. Do you speak French?<eos> No.<eos> - English? - Yes.<eos> You don't know me but I know you very well.
- If you have a reason, tell me.<eos> - I knew you wouldn't guess.<eos> But what?<eos> I am mozita.<eos> - Mozita?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That I've never made love with any man.<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> Mr. Fabert would Iike to see you.
I was sitting on the porch, looking through the screen.<eos> I seen this big white dot in the sky.<eos> It turned red and blue and green.<eos> UFOs do not represent a direct physical threat to national security.<eos> We do not support them, and we encourage you not to.<eos> Let's get in touch with the forest service or we'll end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic.<eos> And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming.<eos> If this mission is fully developed I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.<eos> Your flight will be at 20:00 hours.<eos> We have a limo that'll take you to the heliport now.
OK.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's done.<eos> Yes, it's done.<eos> Can you ask if I may go in there.<eos> There? But of course you may.<eos> I was just wondering why you were waiting for so long.<eos> Comrade colonel will see you right now.
Everyone who travels on that path travels alone.<eos> Between the two dogs.<eos> Do I leave them both behind?<eos> You must answer your own questions now.<eos> You're alone.<eos> - Quickly. Break it up.<eos> - Gently.<eos> I'm not hurt!<eos> Are they dying?<eos> The General will see you now, sir.
I'd have to see you again before I can answer that.<eos> I don't like the kind of love that is supposedly forever... but burns out quickly.<eos> I'd love to see you again.<eos> But as the two of us are always traveling around the world... our chances are slim.<eos> - This might help.<eos> - What is it?<eos> It's my itinerary for the next three months.<eos> The places where I'll be and the hotels I'll be staying at.<eos> Emanuelle, I need to go.<eos> Someone will take you home.
Are you always so cynical?<eos> No, not always.<eos> Only on appropriate occasions.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> That I'd burst into tears, and beg you to forgive me?<eos> I found what I expected.<eos> That goes double!<eos> You... will have to look for someone else, Miss Allen.<eos> That will depend on Stephen, Mrs. Haines, not on you.<eos> Do you really think... that he really loves you?
What are you doing here?<eos> I just sat to think for a bit, I must have fallen asleep.<eos> Listen to that!<eos> Wouldn't the nice, warm bed have been better, eh?<eos> Who goes to bed in the morning?<eos> I got back late.<eos> I started writing a letter to the Pope and it was morning...<eos> Here.<eos> I rewrote the resignation letter.<eos> - Blessed be he who understands you!
- Then I'll never get to know you, how wonderful you are.<eos> I'm serious, even though I'm giving you a line.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> I know you know that.<eos> - I know that.<eos> From the deepest part of my heart, which is not too deep.<eos> Why don't you just go someplace else and try it again?<eos> All right, I'll...<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Was that fellow in the Hawaiian shirt disturbing you?
We still can't move her to a city hospital yet.<eos> But her grafts are doing well.<eos> We've been monitoring the internal grafts electronically, and there's a definite sign of new tissue growth happening in the abdominal cavity.<eos> Her helmet probably saved her from severe brain damage, but until she's fully conscious...<eos> You won't know that either. Well, Hart, what can I tell ya?<eos> There is no magic.<eos> Now, you're welcome to come and visit Rose any time you want.<eos> Please, believe me, I will personally telephone you the instant Rose shows the first signs of regaining consciousness.<eos> Jeez, when I saw them bringing you in,<eos> I never thought I'd be standing here talking to you a month later.
1F.<eos> Well, hello, Calder.<eos> I see you brought Donder and Blitzen.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> - You must be out of your mind.<eos> - It has to be you.<eos> He was very definite.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't even know the son of a bitch.<eos> Apparently he knows you.
- It's a drop. He'll behave himself.<eos> Why did he pick this place?<eos> It's noisy, crowded and hell to cover.<eos> But we have one advantage. - What's that?<eos> - Calder.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> This is the telephone booth.<eos> We're instructed to have Calder waiting outside at 11:30 sharp.<eos> I want an "Out of Order" sign on that booth.<eos> Our friend will contact you by phone to tell you where to take the money.
I'm sorry, Mirza.<eos> I'll be more careful.<eos> Well, make your move.<eos> Advance.<eos> Mr. Nandlal is here.<eos> My goodness.<eos> Show him in.<eos> Welcome!<eos> Hello there.<eos> We haven't seen you for ages.
Hello.<eos> This is Suzy Bannion.<eos> No, we've never met.<eos> I'm a friend of Sara's.<eos> Yes. Hello.<eos> Do you happen to know where Sara is?<eos> Well, she disappeared from school this morning.<eos> Yes, it seems she left and took all her luggage.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, listen, could I see you sometime today?
Right, Sandy, very good.<eos> 'Six, sick, bricks,<eos> tick...'<eos> Yes?<eos> I'd like to see Mrs. Brubaker. My name is Caulfield.<eos> Mrs. Brubaker isn't seeing anyone.<eos> I telephoned this morning. I believe I'm expected.<eos> - What was that name again?<eos> - Caulfield. Robert Caulfield.<eos> Oh, yes. Mrs. Brubaker is expecting you.
The other two are South and West.<eos> - Hello, again.<eos> - Hello, again.<eos> - Can I offer you something to drink?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - What would you like? - Some scotch. Straight, please.<eos> You haven't found what you're looking for, you're embarrassed about bothering me again, however there were one or two questions more you'd like to ask me.<eos> It's something personal and you won't bother me any more.<eos> I haven't found what I'm looking for. I feel embarrassed about bothering you. However, there are one or two more questions I'd like to ask you.<eos> It's something personal and I won't bother you any more.
- Listen, you know who I am, don't you? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, the door to Miss Goode's suite is locked.<eos> - Well, I'm locked out.<eos> You're from up in the penthouse, aren't you? I<eos> - I need to get in. - Have you got the key?<eos> - I have some keys.<eos> I don't know if I have the key to Miss Goode's room.<eos> Would you try one, please?<eos> I'm sure you can get me in.<eos> I haven't seen you in the movies in a while.
Ah, well, of course there is the religious view, though I've always inclined to the expansionist's theory.<eos> Natural progression.<eos> Tell me, Citizen Doctor, are you planning to stay long in Megropolis 1 ?<eos> Not long, no.<eos> Well, while you're here, you must get about a bit.<eos> After all, it is the first and oldest city on Pluto.<eos> There's much of interest to see.<eos> Well, I shall certainly try.<eos> In fact, I shall start right now.<eos> Oh, don't let me detain you any longer.
Stay right there. Don't move!<eos> - The look on your face doesn't bode well for me. - You're so right ...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you're a gentleman, you won't continue.<eos> It will turn out badly for you.<eos> - You see?<eos> - I see! Now shut up! - You're a monster!<eos> - Yes!<eos> I'll hang up if you continue ...<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, but that's the dream I had about you.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Laugh at me, bastard, and I'll shoot you where you stand.<eos> Let's go, Your Honor.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Now, speed!<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Hold it, hold it.<eos> Just take it very easy.<eos> You relax, do just as I say, and I'll get you home, all right?
A big talent.<eos> Big.<eos> Do you know him personally?<eos> Only from the show.<eos> Once in a while, a bite to eat afterwards.<eos> Think you could get to know him better?<eos> I'm not good at that sort of thing.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Actors, inside, you'd be surprised, are very shy.<eos> He knows you already.
I ran a cash register.<eos> You were a cashier?<eos> That's exactly what I mean, see?<eos> Unless it's a writer or an artist, catch you in bed with a cashier...<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - You wouldn't have looked twice.<eos> It is not what someone does, it is who he is.<eos> - And you don't even know who I am.<eos> - Did you ever give me the chance?<eos> I'm giving you right now.
Like I explained to my daughter, I said, there's a spool of thread there.<eos> That thread might have been 15 cents.<eos> A man goes on strike, I said, if they want 30 more cents on an hour-They get their 30 cents.<eos> When they go back to work, they got to raise that price to cover that wage.<eos> The unions is what's doin'it.<eos> The unions is ruinin' the United States.<eos> I went to work when I was 10 years old picking' slate in the coal burner.<eos> Well, at that time we were workin' 10 hours a day... and we were gettin' six-and-a-fraction cents an hour.<eos> Well, we breaker boys... we'd have our feet in the chute and we'd be pickin'the slate out... when the breaker boss would sneak up behind us.<eos> And ifhe'd see a piece of slate comin'through... he'd pick up the slate and hit you in the back with it, and hit you hard.
Walter Kranz here.<eos> Is that Andrée?<eos> Have you fainted?<eos> Kranz speaking.<eos> Yes, it's really me.<eos> You've been writing to me for years. You admire me, want to meet me. Now the time has come.<eos> You can come to me.<eos> I'd like to get to know you.<eos> Good.<eos> Send me a telegram when you come, I'll pick you up.
- And so romantic.<eos> - Romantic?<eos> As you wish. Everyone reads what he likes into it.<eos> But what's more important, I've found a title at last.<eos> Yes?<eos> No Celebration for the Führer's Dead Dog.<eos> "No..." Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> May I bring my brother next time?<eos> I'm sure he'll revere you as much as I do.
Dear Fantozzi, First of all, Happy Christmas.<eos> I have before me your request for readmission and his file.<eos> Sorry if I disturb the privacy of your home on this holy night ... but I spend here in my office, because for me work ... is a prayer.<eos> I need to talk to you for a moment.<eos> Sit down and listen.<eos> So, dear fantozzi, do you accept?<eos> Fantozzi, are you here?<eos> - I' ll accept anything! - But how? You haven't even heard what I said.<eos> I accept anything! I surrender unconditionally! Then come, Fantozzi dear...<eos> What? Are you afraid? But we love you so much.
Alone and helpless! And I will have you yet!<eos> Mr Holmes, your interference in my affairs has gradually grown from mild annoyance to insufferable impertinence.<eos> Tonight's actions have finally rendered you intolerable to me. Really?<eos> Only tonight? You've been intolerable to me much longer than that! Would you be good enough to observe...<eos> This.<eos> Not to mention, this.<eos> Mr Holmes, there are more than a dozen ways to kill a man in this room. And that trapdoor into the Thames will remove all traces of the man's ever having been here.<eos> Do you wonder why I haven't employed any of these devices against you?<eos> Well, it's not for want of trying. No.<eos> It's because they don't suit me. I will destroy you, but in my fashion. Will you?

I don't know, Watson. I don't know. And, yet, if I were Moriarty, and my one unwavering determination the destruction of Sherlock Holmes,<eos> "Chink in your armour"? Rubbish! There's no such thing as a chink in your armour.<eos> Isn't there, Watson? Isn't there?<eos> This'll do very nicely. Thank you, very much. Hansom.<eos> Hansom! I say there, hansom.<eos> Handsome is as handsome does, mister, and you'll do quite nicely.<eos> Well, did you hear that, Holmes? The young lady... Off you go, off you go.<eos> Shoo, shoo...<eos> - Oh, well!<eos> Let that be a lesson to you, Watson. They don't have hansom cabs in New York, just cabs.
Show him to me.<eos> How did you know?<eos> There's no time for that, Madamoiselle. Where is he?<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott!<eos> Scott?<eos> He's drugged.<eos> A few grains of laudanum, that is all, Monsieur. And only when I must go out.<eos> You have most assuredly harmed his mother. What brought you to take part in this outrage?
I had the distinct honour of arresting his brother, Bill, in London a fortnight ago. The Twickenham Toffs have long been a part of Moriarty's organisation. And what did this Charles Nickers say to you?<eos> He said that unless I did as I was bidden my brother, Anatole, in Paris would be murdered.<eos> I see. And what were your orders in addition to pursuading young Scott to take part in a prank against his governess?<eos> I was to bring him here. And then engage a room facing the street. Originally, my room was in the rear.<eos> Then, twice a day I must inform Mr Nickers that the boy is here and no-one has enquired after him.<eos> Inform? In what way?<eos> Each day at eleven, and again at seven, he comes across the street and watches. I walk to the window and open the curtain and nod. And that is all.<eos> Which means it's almost time for him to be there now.<eos> Mademoiselle, you have received Moriarty's instructions now you will hear mine.<eos> When Charles Nickers arrives you will give him the proper signal as you have been told to do, and you will continue to do so twice a day until I relieve you of the responsibility. If you do as I say, you will emerge from this dismal matter unharmed, as will your brother.
SUR THIS COUCH<eos> OU SUR THAT COUCH?<eos> COMME VOUS VOULEZ.<eos> JE CHOOSE THIS COUCH.<eos> I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT REMEMBERING.<eos> IT WAS MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO SINCE I CALLED YOU FROM THAT DREARY LITTLE HARLEM HOTEL.<eos> MMM-HMM.<eos> WELL, TELL ME, UM, WHERE'S SYBIL?<eos> SYBIL IS A BIT EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.<eos> SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HER IN YOUR PRACTICE PRIVEE, SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW SHE WILL EVER REPAY YOU.
- Avro 'time to be when you'll be dead.<eos> - George.<eos> Not that.<eos> Get him out.<eos> And when you're done with him, throw him into one of the wells of the old mine.<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - I came to warn you ...<eos> - Stay calm.<eos> - Soon you will be quiet forever!<eos> - This does not apply to you.
Mr Fawlty.<eos> - Let's sit you up a bit.<eos> - Thank you, Sister.<eos> - Now pop that under your tongue.<eos> - You still here?<eos> - Apparently.<eos> - The doctor's coming.<eos> - My God! A doctor, here in the hospital?<eos> - Whatever can we do?<eos> - You can leave. Why do they call you "sister"?
- What law?<eos> - The law of England.<eos> Nothing to do with me.<eos> - Nothing to do with you? - Nothing at all.<eos> I can give you two singles, if you like, but...<eos> - Shall we go somewhere else? - Excuse me.<eos> There's my key.<eos> And now, I'm off to paint the town red.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Well, er, perhaps I'll see you later this evening?
They must pay rent in food and services. They'll owe total allegiance to this house and its laws. He wants his people as his subjects with a right to administer life and death.<eos> You said you thought I might help.<eos> Well, he obviously trusts you. Talk to him. Make him see sense.<eos> Tell him we'll call a truce if he'll just discuss things with us.<eos> We don't want a war.<eos> -I'll try.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -But how do I contact him again?<eos> I think I know Garland's character well enough by now.<eos> If he thinks we're holding you prisoner, he'll be contacting us.
I dreamed I was ice-skating. On a frozen sea.<eos> It was the North Sea.<eos> I was quite far out.<eos> I couldn't get back... and I kept skating straight ahead.<eos> I was very afraid.<eos> Τhe worst was the grating of the ice skates... behind me on the ice.<eos> "Τhis isn't my dream at all," l kept thinking all the time.<eos> I dreamed you had to die.<eos> As a precaution you were supposed to go... to a mausoleum a few hours earlier below the main street.<eos> A child was to keep you company till you died.
Midnight!<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> Toast!<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> - All the best!<eos> - Who'll kiss me?<eos> - Me! A kiss.<eos> Fantozzi?<eos> Where were you?<eos> I've been looking for you all night.
Tonight she will work in the guardhouse.<eos> Our research is too important. I implore you to inspect it.<eos> General, if I replace the procedure now- -Delayed all our experiments.<eos> General, our discoveries will change the outcome of the war.<eos> Yes, General.<eos> Yes, mein General.<eos> That was good news.<eos> Then the general judge it yourself.<eos> And, General, I ... I conducts its own research<eos> -That probably interests you most.
He was to do certain things, and if he didn't...<eos> You were to do certain things.<eos> Regrettably.<eos> Coffee, darling.<eos> I'm sorry, there's only one cup.<eos> I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this, but want to give me a for instance?<eos> First, you will hand over the Pink Panther.<eos> And second?<eos> I will be forced to shoot you.<eos> Who's forcing you?
Stay there!<eos> Go on, stay there!<eos> Get out!<eos> Does he always keep it locked?<eos> No, I've never seen it locked before...<eos> Ah, there's Jaime!<eos> Jaime!<eos> Jaime!<eos> Miss Angelica!<eos> It's must be six months since we've seen you!
It's unpleasant for me, very unpleasant.<eos> Please explain why I've done this to him.<eos> I had to recall his loan.<eos> We'll get it elsewhere.<eos> I'm so sorry I won't be able to do business with you.<eos> But between us, as friends... why Borowiecki as a partner?<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> But that's no reason; there are people who do. They trust you and know that you are capable.<eos> Why, on just your word... did I give you 30,000 marks?<eos> Why do I treat you like a son?
Drunk?<eos> I wish to hell I was drunk.<eos> Don't.<eos> You'll die if you do.<eos> No, not me. Your friends out there.<eos> I'm gonna take my hand away.<eos> Don't scream. You promise?<eos> You damn fool.<eos> You'll get us both killed.<eos> There's no help for you out there.
"Kafiristan, 10,000 square miles, mountainous terrain..."<eos> religion unknown, population unknown.<eos> Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C.<eos> According to Herioditus... he defeated King Ox Y-Artes... "...whose daughter Roxanne he subsequently took to wife."<eos> If you buy from me, sir, I make you very good price, sir.<eos> Very cheap, very nice thing for you. Specially for you, sir.<eos> Our forward continuance is impeded by this fellow, sir, who is begging the sahib... that you will accompany with him that he may show to you a rare... - ...and wonderful thing.<eos> - Thing? What thing?<eos> Indeed, the man would not say what thing.<eos> Therefore, sahib, sir, I suspect his bad intentions... to entice the sahib into a naughty house of disreputation... where he will take you and kill you and murder you... and cut your throat and rob the money from your pockets also.

More better.
- My dear woman... if we printed a retraction every time someone complained... where would we be?<eos> Write a reader's letter.<eos> - Maybe we'll print that. - No!<eos> I can't wait any longer.<eos> I want something to happen today!<eos> I'm sorry, madam, but I must ask you to leave.<eos> You refuse?<eos> I won't be blackmailed.<eos> - Then-<eos> - Then maybe this will persuade you!
Wagner.<eos> Do you think he was crazy?<eos> How could you come in here by accident?<eos> - I was escaping.<eos> - Oh, from what?<eos> Well, I thought someone might be following me.<eos> - Somebody who might recognize me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, I can't recognize you.
This is a playroom. They ain't gonna be allowed in.<eos> I like to watch women doing little domestic chores.<eos> You came to the right town.<eos> Who was the one wanted tea?<eos> Claude.<eos> Claude Axhelm.<eos> - He's the one who...<eos> - Stutters.<eos> I'm not good on names.<eos> Why do they call you "Dis"?
- Are you insane?<eos> Everybody's dead.<eos> Take it easy. Just take it easy, and we'll bring you home.<eos> Now, here's how we'll do it.<eos> Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?<eos> - Broadway and 71st.<eos> - Broadway and 73rd. There's an alley behind the hotel.<eos> One hour from now at exactly 1530, I want you to enter that alley from the 73rd Street side.<eos> Will you be there?<eos> The head of your department just came here from DC. He's gonna bring you home.
How much do you want?<eos> I just want to stop it.<eos> For a few hours.<eos> For the rest of the night.<eos> And then I'll go.<eos> Joe!<eos> What was his name?<eos> What is it Higgins said? Was it...<eos> The head of your department just came here from DC.<eos> He's gonna bring you home.
He's such a pain.<eos> - I'm late.<eos> You saw Gautier and gave him all your money again.<eos> Tell me or I'll destroy everything.<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> If we're going to stay together, I have to know.<eos> And if you want us to stay together, Olivier, stop this right now.<eos> Don't come back. I can't help people like you.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Don't even beg. I'll never see you again.
Vittorio hasn't chosen his path yet...<eos> Do you know him?<eos> -A little.<eos> Your front row tickets, they weren't easy to get hold of.<eos> Ferrero... Why are you here?<eos> Yes, I had noticed... Vittorio has too much money.<eos> But how did you come to this conclusion?<eos> It's just a suspicion. -Listen...<eos> You're risking a lot saying these things to a person like me...<eos> Either I'll destroy you, or I'll be the first to turn my son in.
To the Seifukaku later.<eos> Yes, certainly.<eos> What will you have?<eos> I'm famished. Eiryo, what do you prefer?<eos> Let's see.<eos> The specialties here are shellfish and barbecued shrimps.<eos> That's just fine for me.<eos> For me too.<eos> Please wait for awhile.<eos> The guests are waiting for you.
F.o.c.<eos> Yes, you know f.o.c.-- Free of charge.<eos> Well, my husband ken--<eos> K.e.n.-- he said...<eos> Oh, forget about your husband, mrs. s.c.u.m.<eos> Or may I call you "mrs. s.?"<eos> You can call me "linda" if you like.<eos> No, I'd rather call you "mrs. s."<eos> Oh. And you can call me "mr. n."<eos> Well, that's what I was calling you.
Well, I'm sorry, I can't remember that.<eos> Forget counting on your friends!<eos> They'll never find this place.<eos> No one knows of it, except Zaius, Urko, myself and a handful of guards.<eos> There is no possibility of escape.<eos> Or rescue.<eos> I will ask a question.<eos> You will answer it fully, honestly.<eos> Then you will be allowed to go.<eos> Which humans have helped you?
Then you will be allowed to go.<eos> Which humans have helped you?<eos> Say, that's a really lovely ring you have there on your tapping finger.<eos> You have a contempt for apes.<eos> You'll change your mind before you're finished.<eos> I have no contempt for apes.<eos> Nor for any thinking animal on this planet.<eos> Then be sensible, be sensible.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> Which humans have helped you?
Then be sensible, be sensible.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> Which humans have helped you?<eos> Whoa!<eos> Move and I'll shoot!<eos> - I won't move.<eos> - Turn around slow.<eos> Put your hands behind you.<eos> Okay, now walk.<eos> Which humans have helped you?
That is certainly so.<eos> - All part of my plan.<eos> Now the producers will have all they want to eat and the security problems will be almost eliminated.<eos> What has this discard to do with your plan, Hurton?<eos> Mighty Bandor, Hurton has saved his greatest surprise for last.<eos> Tell them, Zooma.<eos> This magic webbing, which brings in fish, is all Gahto's idea.<eos> Hurton has saved Gahto so that he can teach others how to make and mend the webbing.<eos> Hurton, I knew you could do it.<eos> Now, that is why I have kept you on here despite efforts of those higher-ups to replace you with my nephew.
Why didn't you say so before?<eos> Do you think - Do you think I'm keen on driving around with little girls and spending my last dime'?<eos> God knows I've got other things to do.<eos> I wanted to stay in Amsterdam.<eos> What do you have to do anyway?<eos> You're only scribbling away in your notebook.<eos> I'm taking you to the police now.<eos> They can help you better than I.<eos> Please sign here.<eos> Can we reach you at the hotel, at least until tomorrow, in case we have any questions?
Absolve me!<eos> Absolve you?<eos> I am one of those thugs and I am betraying them.<eos> No doubt, with a good intent, my son.<eos> No, just to save my skin.<eos> You will bear testimony for me.<eos> - That is the least I can do.<eos> - But, secretly.<eos> The soldiers will take me prisoner.<eos> But how will they recognize you?
I thought it was by accident.<eos> What?<eos> Poor child, tell me the details.<eos> As many as possible, for your salvation.<eos> I've seen acts I don't understand.<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> Acts between whom?<eos> Nuns and prisoners, mostly the pretty ones.<eos> Tell me! Quickly!<eos> Describe it all or the God of Anger will burn you alive over a slow fire.
I don't know what you think you saw.<eos> Sister Julia saw too.<eos> I only saw you in a nightgown, like a Sleepwalker.<eos> You say Sister Julia hates you.<eos> So she'd say anything to hurt you.<eos> Who talks of hurting me?<eos> That's not within your power.<eos> The reenactment is tomorrow.<eos> Try not to act foolish.<eos> I'll take you to your apartment.
Major John Alexander will make a dramatic attempt to rescue 120 persons trapped aboard the giant jet liner without pilot and without crew.<eos> And tragedy within tragedy, one of them a young girl dying unless she's delivered to LA soon for a kidney transplant operation.<eos> Major Alexander has volunteered to make this daring attempt.<eos> He will be lowered on a line from the air-force helicopter and will crawl through the hole torn into the body of the jumbo jet liner.<eos> Here they are now.<eos> What a moment this is.<eos> All right, we're ready here, Nancy.<eos> Remember, I'll tell you everything you have to do.<eos> You can do it.<eos> I can't hear you very well.
Who would want to kill him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe somebody in Pinky's crowd.<eos> - But we're not sure.<eos> - Pinky?<eos> He came into the...<eos> He's just a bum.<eos> Where can I find him?<eos> Look, Miss Frazier, we know this is a strain on you.<eos> Why don't you let Quincy take you to your hotel?
- 8894.<eos> - Drabble speaking.<eos> - Is Harper there?<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Yes?<eos> I am listening.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Just in case you think this is a hoax, a Land Rover on the motorway at the Lightwater Interchange was blown up by a bomb yesterday.<eos> That was our work.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.
Miss Theresa.<eos> You father is waiting for you.
Miss Theresa.<eos> You father is waiting for you.<eos> I know.<eos> - Right now, my sweet.<eos> - I don't want to go.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Your father wants you immediately.
We're well aware of the problem, and we're prepared to settle for his head.<eos> Yeah, but the... head must match the picture.<eos> It's a deal.<eos> But I want 5,000 dollars in advance. I'll need some operating cash, right?<eos> - You don't have to kill him with kindness.<eos> - Give him 200 dollars.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, thank you, gentlemen.<eos> - You've got four days.<eos> - And Bennie... After that, we come to find you.
Just like that.<eos> Slowly... yes, that's it.<eos> The Marquise was always very open-minded.<eos> Especially when I could dive into the sea... of her voluptuous lush body with all my erogenous organs.<eos> Mursule?<eos> Yes, ma'am?<eos> I don't understand all that.<eos> What do you mean, ma'am?<eos> I think my husband has an affair.<eos> Impossible. He admires you.
When you're right, you're right.<eos> And you're right.<eos> I'll pay you the rest next week.<eos> We only caught 60 tons of skipjack.<eos> They pay less for skipjack than albacore tuna.<eos> I only brought it up to illustrate a point.<eos> I don't want your last dime.<eos> - Thank you, Mr Gittes. - Call me Jake.<eos> Careful driving home.<eos> Mrs Mulwray is waiting for you, with Mr Walsh and Mr Duffy.
Now you propose another dirt-banked dam, with slopes of 21/2 to 1,112 feet high, and a 12,000-acre water surface.<eos> Well, it won't hold.<eos> I won't build it, it's that simple.<eos> I'm not going to make the same mistake twice.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Get those goddam things out of here!<eos> Tell me where to take them!<eos> You don't have an answer for that.<eos> You steal water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve the livestock...<eos> Who's paying you to do that, Mulwray?
You and your husband never discussed her?<eos> We did. He wouldn't tell me her name.<eos> We quarrelled over her, of course.<eos> It came as a complete surprise to me.<eos> A complete surprise?<eos> I thought you hired a private investigator.<eos> A private investigator?<eos> Mr Gittes.<eos> Yes, but I did that to put an end to a ridiculous rumour that had no basis.<eos> When did Mr Gittes inform you that the rumours had some foundation in fact?
- Drink?<eos> Tom Collins with lime, not lemon.<eos> I got your check in the mail.<eos> - As I said, I was very grateful.<eos> - I'm afraid that's not good enough.<eos> - How much would you like?<eos> - Oh, stop it.<eos> The money's fine.<eos> But I think you short-changed me on the story.<eos> Something else besides the death of your husband was bothering you.
It was therapy.<eos> One time the doorbell rang and she went down to answer it.<eos> I started sliding down.<eos> I could feel the water.<eos> It started coming up to my chin, to my nose.<eos> And when I woke up, my body was all greasy from the holy oil she put on my body.<eos> I remember being disappointed I survived.<eos> When I was five, my father introduced me to a friend of his, and for no reason at all, I hit him right in the stomach with all my strength.<eos> He died a year later.<eos> He'll kill you if he gets a chance.
I'm putting you on hold.<eos> - Mr. Caul, we'll get right back to you. - No.<eos> You don't have my telephone number!<eos> Hello?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Mr. Caul?<eos> This is Martin Stett.<eos> How did you get this phone number?<eos> We prepare a full dossier on everyone who comes in contact with the director.<eos> You know that means we've been watching you.
Yes, my dear Gieshuebler, but just for a moment.<eos> I've come to say goodbye.<eos> But, my dear lady, surely you'll be back.<eos> I heard it was for just 3 or 4 days...<eos> Yes, I should return.<eos> In a week at the latest, I'm supposed to be back in Kessin.<eos> But who knows if I shall return?<eos> I don't have to tell you, so many things can happen.<eos> You want to say I'm too young... but even young people die.<eos> And if I lived to be a hundred, I'd never forget you.
Georges, tell her to go screw herself.<eos> With your permission, madam.<eos> This must be a sick joke.<eos> My sister's been dead for four years.<eos> But, sir... she insists.<eos> She wants to see you tonight in the family vault.<eos> She says the key's in your right-hand desk drawer.<eos> Why, that's true.<eos> Ask her what I requested she play one hot summer day when I went in her room.<eos> The commissioner wants to know what he asked you to play one hot summer day when he went in your room.
Well, I expect we've held you up long enough, haven't we?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, that's all right.<eos> I just wanna make sure she's OK.<eos> She'll be all right, Mr., erm...?<eos> - Kind.<eos> - Kind?<eos> Oh.<eos> Kind in name and nature.<eos> Don't worry, Mr. Kind, just leave your address with one of my nurses.<eos> I'm sure the girl will want to contact you when she's better.
The girl's doing her best.<eos> Do you know where I drank the best Pink Lady?<eos> In the bar in Rue Magellan. The best bar in Paris!<eos> Why don't you put on some music?<eos> Miss Beaulieu, very serious things are happening. Did you know I was a film actress, Lucien?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Last year, I had a great role in "Nights in the Casbah".<eos> - Starring Yvonne Lévère.<eos> - Then I can see you at the movies!
- It's Lucien's mother.<eos> - Lucien!<eos> Your mother came to the hotel looking for you.<eos> I thought I was doing right bringing her here.<eos> Well, I'll be off.<eos> - That man is very kind.<eos> - Do come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Mother, will you bring us some tea?<eos> Excuse me for receiving you dressed like this.
Never.<eos> But you said three gigantic rip-offs.<eos> That's only two.<eos> - You don't want to ruin the surprise.<eos> - Surprise?<eos> - There's one thing.<eos> - What?<eos> You're going to have to perform a personal service.<eos> What kind of personal service?<eos> The warden's expecting you.
- Fetch them at once.<eos> Well, can't you tap the telephone wires? - Or fire a rocket, or something?<eos> - This is not a ship, madame.<eos> We are between Vinkovci and Brod.<eos> - But in what country?<eos> - In Yugoslavia. The Balkans. What else can you expect?<eos> Snow is God's will.<eos> And all is for the best. Yeah, but how long do you think before we can start getting out of here?<eos> As soon as the stationmaster at Brod sees that we do not arrive on time, he will send...<eos> Dr Constantine, Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.
In ten weeks, we make $14,000 and... and 27 cents.<eos> Miss Ohlsson, how long have you been interested in religion?<eos> From five years.<eos> In summer, in... I had been sick as always. And I sat in the grass in the garden.<eos> And I... I saw Jesus in the sky medmany little children, but all the children were brown.<eos> So it was a sign for me to look after little brown babies. Yes.<eos> Were your parents religious?<eos> Nej, they had no respect for God.<eos> So it was not just a sign. It was also a punishment.<eos> Oh, there, there, there, there. I'm sure that God will forgive you, Miss Ohlsson, and perhaps, which is more important, so will your father and mother. Now...
Sorry if I hurt the lad.<eos> Provocation.<eos> They could have done it together. She has hidden fire.<eos> She is very strong. Why did you not ask her if she had been to America?<eos> Because I did not need to.<eos> Pierre, le colonel s'excuse de son geste.<eos> - Signor Foscarelli!<eos> You are a naturalised American subject?<eos> - For how long? Seven years.<eos> Otherwise, he will detain you longer than you would detain him.
Jacob, the order I gave you yesterday. It hasn't arrived yet.<eos> I sent the boy over. Your doorman said you'd left.<eos> I'm here. I'm still here.<eos> Send the boy directly to apartment 1 5, will you ?<eos> I'll send him over again.<eos> -Thank you,Jacob. -My duty.<eos> What did you say you wanted ?<eos> - Certainly, sir.<eos> There's a choice.<eos> [ Chattering ] Perhaps I can be of help to you.
Goodbye.<eos> Your tumour seems to have improved.<eos> I don't have much pain now, sir.<eos> You'll need a new identity.<eos> And a new passport.<eos> I'm sending you to one of our people in Bayreuth.<eos> His name is Klaus Wenzer.<eos> He's a specialist at this kind of thing.<eos> Probably the best.<eos> After he's fixed you up with documents he'll pass you on to someone who'll tell you what to do next.
CASSIS, FRANCE<eos> I'm Chief-Inspector Gardet of the Sûreté Générale<eos> Mr Lev Davidovich Bronstein, known as Leon Trotsky...<eos> For humanitarian reasons, and as an exceptional measure... the government of France hereby grants you asylum<eos> There is one condition...<eos> You may not intervene in the internal affairs of France<eos> We had you disembark here at Cassis... to avoid demonstrations<eos> The Press is waiting in Marseilles<eos> We want to keep your itinerary a secret<eos> Here is a copy of the decree authorizing you to reside in France
Get me my breakfast.<eos> I can't do magic.<eos> Always this commandeering tone.<eos> I really have to get her out of this habit.<eos> Either she changes, or I walk.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> I implored you to wake me early.<eos> When I sleep late I have nightmares.<eos> I apolgize.<eos> I didn't wake you on purpose.
But what did you bring with you, rocks? Books, books!<eos> But, weren't Gabriella and you in love?<eos> Yes, but thats not enough.<eos> You are right!<eos> I loved a woman too, but we broke up.<eos> Nicola, you will never guess who took her away from me.<eos> Gianni.<eos> Far away from that puddle of stagnant water!<eos> It is here in this stimulating city atmosphere that the cultural impetus finds its wider and Hail, oh goddess Rome! He who disregards you is wise.<eos> I beg you humbly to pardon me.
It's Ocho.<eos> The Boss has been anxiously waiting.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Brother.<eos> Look at your faces.<eos> Is that how you greet me after five years?<eos> Madam Guest, come in.<eos> Please.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Miss Ocho, the Boss will see you later.
- Good morning.<eos> What... What do you want?<eos> You should leave now.<eos> No, I don't want to go anywhere.<eos> May I stay here?<eos> Yes, you may.<eos> Now, let's talk seriously.<eos> What is wrong you?<eos> What can I say...<eos> - Who is following you?
I'll give you five minutes.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Mr. Sato, your political career is hanging by a thread.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - 50 million in cash.<eos> That should keep you safe.<eos> Ludicrous!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> What are these?<eos> If those get released, the political foundation that has supported you will collapse.
They are too indiscreet. Curious.<eos> We could make love and say that we have not done it.<eos> Or we could not do it, and say we have done it.<eos> Yes, we must satisfy their curiosity.<eos> Let's tell them something that will shock them.<eos> For example, that Your Majesty spanked me.<eos> - Will they believe you?<eos> - Your Majesty, I am a great actress.<eos> The truth is... that you will surely go back to them. And you will tell them what did not happen between us in every detail.<eos> - Is that why they pay you?
You see, first and foremost this is a murder investigation.<eos> Well, my business is purely financial.<eos> Oh, you're very lucky so far Mr. Boyle.<eos> All you've found missing is about $1300.<eos> Well, if you're a nice fellow nice things happen to you.<eos> So I hear.<eos> Now, where can you be reached?<eos> I'm at a motel, in Kendrick.<eos> The Travel-On-Inn.<eos> I'll have Mr. Young get in touch with you as soon as he's free.
I want to go home to the hotel.<eos> This is a Police Station.<eos> I don't want to stay here.<eos> I can't tell you how sorry I am.<eos> There was a misunderstanding...<eos> They took us out of our hotel.<eos> We were arrested.<eos> Then they asked us about your wife...<eos> - I know. I'm truly sorry.<eos> I'm taking you back now.
I don't know.<eos> No, not really, I suppose.<eos> But I have made... a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.<eos> You would want to do the exorcism yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Might be best to have a man with experience.<eos> Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions.<eos> I understand, Your Excellency.<eos> Let's see who's around.<eos> In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know.
This astrological urban legend that for hundreds of years has predicted world history and the holy spirit's destiny.<eos> In just a few days we'll be exposed to these powerful astrophysical side effects...<eos> It all has to do with Venus's orbit.<eos> The last time Venus was closest to the earth, in the year 1769 they found some disturbing erotic behavior among the natives in Tahiti.<eos> All this because of Venus's orbit and its connection to Jupiter.<eos> And... during the upcoming orbit there will be a new target on earth.<eos> And in the middle of this target is...<eos> "Nulpolitterordens" boarding school for young, beautiful... delinquent girls.<eos> We have to protect these young virgins from the temptations of the universe.<eos> And therefore, we're sending you to the small village Petit-Bois.
I think I'll take a bit...<eos> It'll get me going.<eos> "One third of the powder is to be dissolved in water and given to the girls by 5 pm. "<eos> "The rest you put in the city's reservoir... "<eos> God almighty! .<eos> "... put into the city's reservoir by 4 pm. "<eos> That's a few hours from now.<eos> I have time...<eos> Mr. Armand?<eos> Miss Astra is expecting you.
Did you ever stole cherries, Rémy?<eos> Drink some more, that always helps.<eos> Are you coming with me for a moment?<eos> You got your eyes on something ...<eos> yes.<eos> You are really warm.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Me too,<eos> because of you.<eos> It's funny, Simone, today, I see you with a different eye.
Climate and diet, these are important of course to keep you young.<eos> But we believe it is the lack of struggle in our way of life.<eos> How often in your countries do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death." or " this thing or that thing killed him."<eos> Your lives are, as a rule shorter. Not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.<eos> Unfortunately true.<eos> "Climate, diet, and harmony." you said. And somewhere the guiding mind. Is that it?<eos> Is it not enough?<eos> What worries me is that it's a little like a dream, from which I shall shorty, but unpleasantly, awake.<eos> You surprised me.<eos> I surprised you?
- I'm positive.<eos> Come on.<eos> You never understand anything anyway.<eos> I certainly don't understand this! It's destroying me!<eos> I'm sorry, but I was hired to play a secretary.<eos> No one ever mentioned a bathing suit.<eos> If they had, I'd have brought my own.<eos> It may not be in the script, but the scene works better.<eos> Alexandre has brought his secretary along as a guest on vacation.<eos> You're swimming, and he calls you to dictate a letter.
What's all this about?<eos> You're not really leaving!<eos> I am.<eos> I'm giving it all up.<eos> No, you're going to stay and finish the film.<eos> Even if I stayed, I couldn't possibly work.<eos> I'm a physical wreck.<eos> You think it's normal for someone to suddenly stop loving you and just walk out?<eos> Then it was all phony and rotten.<eos> I know what you're feeling. It hurts terribly. But I think Liliane still loves you.
Excuse me.<eos> I don't think you've met my new assistant, Travis.<eos> Travis, this is Basil Keyes.<eos> I could send Travis along sometime tomorrow.<eos> We've got a night sitting, that should finish before lunch.<eos> - So anywhere near the House of Commons.<eos> - Right.<eos> Mr. President, I'll take these documents home with me, if I may.<eos> Study them thoroughly.<eos> I shan't keep you waiting.
We, uh, saw you sitting alone and thought we could help you.<eos> Yeah, well, I bet you could, but, um...<eos> Your friend said we should do whatever you wanted.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think Kruger's our man.<eos> I got some bad news.<eos> If I am understanding this correctly, you actually had the man responsible for Nasir's kidnapping in your custody and then you let him get away.<eos> At the time, we didn't know Kruger was responsible.<eos> Right, right, right because he told you that he wasn't.
He went to the summit.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> She's got to mean the global business summit.<eos> It's taking place about two miles from here.<eos> All cell phones will be returned to you after the conclusion of the summit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hoyt, how's she doing?<eos> Unconscious.<eos> My Swedish is a little rusty, but I think she's gonna be okay.<eos> Langley put you on the list at the summit.
It's him, not the laptop, that matters.<eos> I will pass this up the chain of command, and they will decide how to proceed.<eos> I don't think so. Excuse me?<eos> We're going back to Germany.<eos> We're gonna go to Karl Becker's to get that kid. This is our case.<eos> Now, you might not like it, but you know as well as I do that we don't need to go through normal channels.<eos> And if you try to stop it, I'll go up the chain of command myself.<eos> Fine.<eos> Go. But if this kid is not who you two say he is...<eos> Let's just say it's a good thing that catering business is working out well for you.
They'd prefer that Mathias stay here to receive the treatment he needs.<eos> We'll make sure that happens.<eos> And let me guess, see if he can break a code or two for us?<eos> Have a nice day, agents bloom.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Oh, hi, hotel guy.<eos> Bye, hotel guy.<eos> He's nice.<eos> So the funeral went well?<eos> Mrs. Dixon didn't call you?
I found the frequency carrying the signal from the plane's beacon.<eos> I just need to triangulate on the exact location.<eos> What's the matter? Checkpoint.<eos> No checkpoint.<eos> So let's go the other way then.<eos> The other way has mines.<eos> I can point which way, but I cannot take you there.<eos> Very dangerous.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I can take you that way.
You're used to being dressed like a hooker, but to me...<eos> Okay, whose cologne is making my eyes water?<eos> You guys are here... and here.<eos> Cover team is here.<eos> Backup here, here... and here.<eos> You will not be wired, but you will have earpieces so we can talk you through.<eos> Peck, run the drill.<eos> Well, we need the John to offer money for a sex-related act, and then he is arrestable, so we give the signal, cover team moves in and makes the collar.<eos> Good.<eos> Do not let anyone touch you.
How did you escape?<eos> They moved me about a week ago. I don't know why.<eos> It may have been the patrol from Camelot.<eos> The patrol found you?<eos> I thought I was going to be free.<eos> But then I saw them killed.<eos> Every one of them cut down.<eos> But that night the bandits were distracted by their spoils.<eos> I took my chance.<eos> When I saw you, I couldn't believe it.
That's enough.<eos> Leave us.<eos> You should sit.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's all I've done for the past year - sit... and pray that you hadn't given up on me.<eos> Oh, never. I don't know why.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> You've done more for me than any guardian.<eos> You've always cared for me, loved me like I was your own daughter.<eos> And yet I've insulted you, defied you, hurt you.
Now we ain't doing nothing wrong here.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Special Agent van Alden with the bureau of internal revenue.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Just strengthening the lord's army one lost soul at a time.<eos> I call it "the week of miracles."<eos> "And John did baptize in the wilderness."<eos> Deacon Cuffy, shiloh baptist church of Atlantic City.<eos> As far as I know, we are breaking no laws, sir.<eos> You think Christ hears you in this forsaken place?
Thanks, Nucky.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Then God bless us all.<eos> And good luck on election day.<eos> - Good luck, Halloran. - How about that?<eos> Mr. harrow is on the phone.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Sheriff now.<eos> Hey fellas, fellas, you wanna race?<eos> I'll race you all the way to the pier.
His Majesty, the King!<eos> Mr. Sidwell, your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty, we your humble servants confess that we wretches have most grievously, wantonly, and heinously offended your Majesty in the most unnatural, odious, and distasteful acts of outrageous disobedience and traitorous rebellion.<eos> We beg your Majesty to rid your mind of any relics of indignation you might still harbour against us, and we pray henceforward to pray ceaselessly for your preservation, and for that of your queen and of your son, the Prince Edward,<eos> so God Almighty help us!<eos> I harbour no relics of indignation against you.<eos> And for these shows of loyalty I forgive you all your trespasses against us.<eos> Long live the King!<eos> The Lady Mary Tudor.<eos> Lady Mary, God bless you!
Don't you know who I am?<eos> Or what I could do to you?<eos> You don't think you're the only one, do you?<eos> I have a store of other lovers beside you!<eos> Now get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Your Grace!<eos> Your Majesty-<eos> The devoted clergy of your Majesty's Church of England, and the nobility and loyal gentlemen of York, welcome you most heartily.
Am I not still able?<eos> To have a wife?<eos> To have more children?<eos> To be myself?<eos> John.<eos> John, I need to say something to you.<eos> John.<eos> Go to hell...<eos> Catherine Parr, we are sent here by the King's Majesty to offer you, after your days of mourning for your late husband are complete, his Majesty's hand in marriage.<eos> His Majesty esteems you above all other women in his kingdom and hopes to find you well disposed towards his offer, in which case he will be the happiest man now alive in England, and you the happiest woman.
You must not be so familiar with the Queen of England.<eos> The King ought to know how beggardely his wife's servants treat her.<eos> Damn you Fell!<eos> Damn you!<eos> His Majesty wishes to thank God for blessing him with so perfect a companion as Queen Katherine.<eos> I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord-<eos> Thou hast been pleased to give me a wife as her I now have.<eos> What does this letter say?<eos> I thought Your Majesty just read-<eos> I asked you to tell me what this letter says, my Lord Hertford.
That's why...<eos> That's why you knew her carnally?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We didn't think we were doing anything wrong.<eos> She was going to be my wife and I her husband.<eos> We'd made promises before God.<eos> Why did you not marry her, then?<eos> I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.<eos> When I returned, Katherine was already at court.<eos> The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.<eos> And?<eos> Your Majesty- I have to tell Your Majesty that, even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...<eos> The Queen received the attentions of her music master,<eos> Henry Manox, when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.<eos> Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead... But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.<eos> There is ample proof that they spent many nights together... Naked.<eos> Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.<eos> Unfortunately... Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress, appointing him her personal secretary and usher.<eos> I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought- and if she had an opportunity- would have betrayed you in deed.
No, my Lord.<eos> He never did.<eos> I will go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.<eos> Wait!<eos> I have important things to say.<eos> My Lady?<eos> I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.<eos> He used importunate force against me.<eos> In a manner-violence.<eos> He raped you?
The King's groom?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?<eos> Quite well.<eos> I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.<eos> He called me his " sweet little fool."<eos> And did you commit adultery with him?<eos> No, my Lord.<eos> I never did- although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.<eos> Lady Rochford encouraged you?
"who made for him a French fennel to give to me.<eos> "And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present, "and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.<eos> "He called me "wife," "and touched the secret parts of my body.<eos> "I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.<eos> "And one day, "he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it, "saying, 'Here, wife, "'a gift for me.'<eos> "And he kissed me often and so passionately "that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough."<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot- with several persons.<eos> You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
Ask last night's late shift.<eos> Damn it.<eos> She'll do.<eos> But any problems, it's on you, Brody. Yuri will explain on the way to meet the rest of the team.<eos> Well, who are they?<eos> You'll never know.<eos> That way, if you get busted, everyone's anonymous.<eos> You're gonna have code names.<eos> You're "London." Brody, "Dallas."<eos> "Boise" and "Memphis" are waiting for you back at the launch site and "Chicago" is on his way from Vegas.
This is the Marshall pucci foundation. We save people.<eos> Uh, it kind of defeats the purpose of a hood when you tell him where we are.<eos> - Call the police.<eos> - Everybody, let's just calm down. Fine.<eos> I'll call them.<eos> Ilsa!<eos> I'm not sure I can let you do that, boss.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, ma'am?<eos> I'll call you back.
But I'll tell you something.<eos> The minute she got on that plane to china, I changed the locks on the door and filed for sole custody.<eos> Yes?<eos> - Sophie gerard?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Detective benson. This is detective stabler.<eos> What is this about?<eos> We should talk inside.<eos> okay.<eos> Did my neighbors call you?
Aunt Abby called, said dad wanted me to come by.<eos> Aunt Abby's a liar.<eos> Well, I should know. I put her up to it.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> No, look, no.<eos> You stay, all right?<eos> And we'll leave. I mean, after all, it is your place.<eos> Or it will be, you know, when your dad kicks the bucket.<eos> I mean, with Kira gone, you and Rudy get the business.<eos> Jim may have left you out of his life, but he didn't cut you out of his will.
I'm guessing the time of death was sometime night before last.<eos> Doc Gooden will do a full autopsy.<eos> You know she won't miss a thing, Bob.<eos> But I suspect what we will find is that Paula went swimming after curfew, like she always did, and got pulled under by the current and hit her head.<eos> I'm gonna rule it an accident for now.<eos> She must have snuck out.<eos> Bob, we both know she's been sneaking out just about every night since she got here.<eos> Listen, why don't you take Michelle on home.<eos> She's gonna need you to be strong now.<eos> I'll get Deputy Frost to take you back in the rickshaw.
Yeah.<eos> I'll confess, Randy and I haven't been communicating too well as of late.<eos> I know he's hurting, but he won't talk to me.<eos> You know, it wasn't too long ago that Gus and I were Randy's age. It was a pretty long time ago.<eos> - Ah, it wasn't that long ago.<eos> - You like to think so.<eos> I can't do this with you right now. Fine.<eos> He's upstairs in his room.<eos> We'll give it a shot.<eos> So my dad hired you to shake me down, right?
I really enjoy being lifted.<eos> Excuse me. Can I help you?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Have you seen another set of guys that look like us?<eos> We seem to have lost track of our chicken fight.<eos> This is serious business.<eos> I am not even remotely joking.<eos> If any of you have seen this bear, you better tell me now.<eos> You may think it's a big, fluffy toy, but I assure you this is no Teddy Bear.<eos> This creature will kill you.
Maybe he figures out her secret.<eos> So she decides to off him too and then it's on to the next set of pecs.<eos> Maybe the killing feels good.<eos> Like the soft, supple flesh of a man-buck.<eos> You disturb me.<eos> And your theory on this murder disturbs me.<eos> And you disturb me.<eos> - You said that twice.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, officers.
I'm glad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Every ill-conceived word.<eos> Now I have to find a date to this thing.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> If you haven't heard already, we have a potential serial killer on the loose who has poisoned three victims within five days.<eos> Now, your department heads will brief you on the specifics, but what you need to know right now is that every officer here is on this case.<eos> All precinct resources will be made available to you, including outside consultants.
Everyone in a suit isn't CIA.<eos> We're special military ops.<eos> Mr. Spencer, you are aware that you helped aid and abet one of the world's most dangerous government operatives?<eos> Well, when you say it like that it makes it sound way worse than it is.<eos> And how would you prefer I say it?<eos> Inflection is everything.<eos> Try it again.<eos> Maybe a little singsongy.<eos> Shawn. You will cooperate with these men.<eos> I wanna know everything that Nadia said to you.
I'll give you my flight logs.<eos> God, that felt good. Being open and honest.<eos> Good job, Spencer.<eos> You led Nadia right to Strabinsky and now she took him out.<eos> She was cleaning up her tracks, eliminating witnesses.<eos> Well, if that's the case, then why are Gus and I still alive?<eos> Because you two aren't worth eliminating.<eos> Oh, we're worth eliminating.<eos> Agent Fong, call in for air support.<eos> I want the rest of you to fan out on the mountainside.
I can lock you down from here.<eos> Stand by for egress.<eos> Docking clamps in place, sir.<eos> Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> Hi.<eos> Colonel Young.<eos> This must be just as much a surprise to you.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You will exit the shuttle one person at a time.<eos> Sergeant Greer and members of his team will escort you to a holding area.
Why?<eos> The real Halbridge had no family, but was coming into some serious cash from an inheritance.<eos> Price was poor.<eos> So Price knocks him off and then steals his identity.<eos> Halbridge's body is lying there at Ridgemont, driving Price crazy.<eos> His own tell-tale heart.<eos> Pay up.<eos> What?<eos> Peter told me you would bring up the tell-tale heart.<eos> Oh, I'm glad my grasp of Gothic fiction is a source of amusement for you.
I'll keep you posted.<eos> Drugs?<eos> You think brianna was on drugs?<eos> Re you mental?<eos> If we don't know what she took, the doctors can't help her.<eos> Okay, what is wrong with you?<eos> Your friend is in the hospital after inhaling amphetamines.<eos> - Do you not care?<eos> - Ampheta-whatever.<eos> Speed, which can kill you.
You think you'd be safe inside?<eos> Safe in your cell.<eos> Maybe, until we catch him.<eos> What if he's in the same nick as you, eh?<eos> On the same wing.<eos> He stabbed Fiona Hutchinson 23 times.<eos> He smashed Karal Turay's head in.<eos> What's he going to do to you?<eos> Do you think anyone's gonna come running when they hear you?<eos> I told you what I did.
You scream, I blast your face open. Same goes for you. Now get up.<eos> Get up!<eos> You listen carefully, you do what I say, no one gets hurt... very simple.<eos> Please.<eos> Just... just take whatever you want.<eos> Not too tight?<eos> I guess not.<eos> Beautiful house, Carter.<eos> Where's the safe?<eos> Anyone tries to leave, cousin red lights you up.
Devin?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hello?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> '95 chateau margaux.<eos> I could tell you had taste.<eos> So, where have you and Alex been?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean the dust. The empty garbage cans.<eos> I saw you two days ago, but before that, you were out of town?
This is so nice for me.<eos> To be with all three of you together... Which I think is as it should be!<eos> I'll catch you!<eos> - Prince Edward!<eos> Prince Edward! A little decorum, please!<eos> - Edward!<eos> - Come here, your Grace.<eos> Now, tell me, you love the Lady Bryan, don't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I think she loves you too
I escaped.<eos> But I came back.<eos> You've got blood on your head.<eos> Take shots. Come on! Forward!<eos> Forward! For your lives!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All of you.<eos> It has been an honor and a privilege to have worked alongside men such as you.<eos> God be with you.<eos> - God bless you, sir.
What I do know is that she is not of our faith.<eos> She pretends-but she is not a Catholic.<eos> She is a heretic-and still you leave me in her care!<eos> - Madam... - No...<eos> No, it is not your fault.<eos> It is my fault.<eos> If I had been a boy and not a girl, none of this would have ever happened. And England would still be faithful.<eos> - Princess!<eos> I beg you.<eos> - I am a lot older than I was when I first knew you.
No, it is not your fault.<eos> It is my fault.<eos> If I had been a boy and not a girl, none of this would have ever happened. And England would still be faithful.<eos> - Princess!<eos> I beg you.<eos> - I am a lot older than I was when I first knew you.<eos> And wiser.<eos> I do not know if I shall ever be married, or if I will ever be Queen.<eos> Probably neither.<eos> But if I do become Queen, I swear to you now on the Holy Gospels and on the soul of my mother, that I will make England faithful again.
Yes, I asked the Israelites to kill the Canaanites.<eos> Women and children included. (Jesus) Yes.<eos> Is that any way for a Godof loveto behave?<eos> I am love.<eos> But I'm also holy and I cannot allow sin to go unpunished and that's not just for my sake. It's for yours.<eos> I don't want you to wallow In sin and rebellion and guilt<eos> I want you to thrive inunending peace and joy.<eos> There isn't one human being on this planet that's an accident<eos> I handformed you In your mother's womb and I formed you for a purpose.<eos> I put before you a path of love and worship.
Ok, gang, our friends at the university have put us in a corner.<eos> Nationals is a must this year.<eos> It's win or go home.<eos> To win, we need to qualify. The opportunity to do that is next Saturday.<eos> To be competitive against Memphis Christian, we need to up our game.<eos> Change up our moves, we're in a rut.<eos> Vanessa, our moves are textbook.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna check the textbook.<eos> All right? I want you to go in that gym right now, and I want you to forget everything you know. Ok?<eos> Go where the music takes you.
It's my fault.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Why is my signature on these documents?<eos> Because you live in Tree Hill with your friends, wandering about, going to film festivals and the like.<eos> Be careful, mother.<eos> Brooke, we sign all kinds of things for you.<eos> But you knew this was illegal.<eos> And now my supposed signature is on everything.<eos> Honey, you empowered us to do this.<eos> No, I empowered you to pick a cover model for the magazine, not to send me to prison.
Why is my signature on these documents?<eos> Honey, you empowered us to do this.<eos> No, I empowered you to pick a cover model for the magazine, not to send me to prison.
I'm gonna put these two back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you kidding me, Haley? !<eos> I called you here to help me!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I... you're right.<eos> I forgot how much my hormones act up when I'm pregnant.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm so excited you're getting married!<eos> If this impresses you, I can also cut the deck - with my tongue.
This has happened... you acting weird like something's wrong.<eos> Ellie, come on. Everything is fine.<eos> Just, you know, we're getting married.<eos> I guess I should be looking after you properly, huh?<eos> Off you go.<eos> G'day, Danny.<eos> You following me all day?<eos> No.<eos> We got a tip that people use this premises for injecting drugs.<eos> Joe fucking Dooley sent you.
- No.<eos> No. I'm more than capable... Don't!<eos> Off!<eos> She's coming.<eos> Be cool. Well, all right, good folks, let's just do the drill.<eos> Passports and where you from, where you headed?<eos> We are from Californ-I-A, headed...<eos> - To Calgary. - Yeah.<eos> You just missed the Stampede.<eos> So, how do y'all know each other, and what brings you to Calgary?
Der...who's Derek?<eos> Dr. Derek thurgood.<eos> He taught my paleoanthropology class Last year at Tesla.<eos> The guy's a genius.<eos> Really? Well, why don't you come and watch me kick His smart ass off my property?<eos> Well, let's.<eos> You don't know what a big deal this is.<eos> You'll just have to give us more time.<eos> You have had three days to move it.<eos> Well, I was working on it, But this little intimidation stunt of yours Isn't helping you.
Cops come to my house last night.<eos> My fucking house!<eos> My wife and daughter sleeping in the next room.<eos> Joe fucking Dooley in my house.<eos> The cops won't catch us. They're fucking idiots.<eos> You're the fucking idiot.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What the fuck do you think I do?<eos> I polite, tell them I know nothing about anything, give them coffee, pour oil on your Red fucking Sea.<eos> If any one of you do anything like this again, I break your legs.
What's going on?<eos> We'll see you at your trial, detectives.<eos> Hmm. Okay, so just keep in mind that this is a rough cut.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe we should wait.<eos> Fred, be quiet.<eos> Let's start the show.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to harrison parker.<eos> Let me show you around.
I think your faction is engaged in a fight to the death with Bishop Gardiner and his.<eos> - I will not hide the truth from you, Your Grace.<eos> The King's infirmity and the youth of my nephew make the question of succession urgent.<eos> The stakes could not possibly be higher.<eos> - And you desire to know, I assume, on which side of the argument I belong?<eos> - Your Grace, whether you will it or not, you carry a great weight of confidence and influence with the King.<eos> And everyone knows that.<eos> But fewer people know that your wife, the Duchess, and my wife Anne, together with the Queen, are as close on matters of religion as it is possible to be.<eos> And this close affinity has emboldened me, now, to approach Your Grace.<eos> - Surely your wife has told you that the Duchess and I are estranged!
I advise you to tear up your warrant,<eos> Your Grace.<eos> - Majesty, Her Majesty the Queen.<eos> - Kate.<eos> Come in here.<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> - I am glad you have come.<eos> You can resolve me of certain doubts.<eos> I wonder, Kate, how much you think you can learn from reading the Gospels and other religious books?<eos> - Majesty, since God has appointed you as Supreme Head of us all, it is from you that I will ever learn.
- Lord Hertford!<eos> - My Lord Hertford!<eos> - Your Grace, I have already explained, he called me a knave!<eos> All manner of things. - But for whose ears?<eos> Supposing he still wants the Queen to feel falsely secure?<eos> - If it was feigned anger, it seemed very real to me!<eos> My Lords, in the King'sbsence, Council is called upon to declare its content with the terms of the peace treaty with France.<eos> All in favour say "aye" - Aye.<eos> - Council is also called upon to discuss all arrangements made for the security and safety of His Highness Prince Edward, heir to the throne, and all provisions made for his temporal and spiritual welfare.<eos> - My Lords, pray, what induces you to discuss such things now, when all such provisions are already made and the Prince is secure at Windsor, by His Majesty's orders?
And what are you but a puffed-up porkling of the Pope's?<eos> - My Lord!<eos> - I still say- my Lord Hertford- that the real truth behind your intentions towards the Prince and the crown must be placed before the King.<eos> - What are you doing? Take your hands off!<eos> - Your Majesty, Bishop Gardiner desires an audience with your Majesty.<eos> - Refused.<eos> His Grace has a troublesome nature and I don't want to see him here ever again.<eos> I desire him to leave my court.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Grace, His Majesty instructs you to leave court.
You have killed him!<eos> - No!<eos> Herewith, my Lords, is my testament.<eos> When I am dead, my Lord Hertford will act as Lord Protector during Prince Edward's minority.<eos> He will be supported by my Lord Chancellor Risley and Archbishop Cranmer.<eos> It is my desire to be buried next to the body of my true and loving wife, Queen Jane Seymour, at Windsor.<eos> You shall raise an honorable tomb, upon which will be our effigies, fashioned as if we are sweetly sleeping.<eos> - Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Mr. Holbein awaits you in the Chapel.
- Again and again, the Council refused to send reinforcements that I asked for.<eos> Even the garrison at Calais refused to help, except to send some flat-footed, squint-eyed, unshapely men unfit to carry arms.<eos> And now, my command is revoked.<eos> Now I am a man of no service.<eos> No activity.<eos> And I must sit at home within the walls.<eos> - Do not think of this as the end of your life, my Lord.<eos> God has given you grace, courage, liberality.<eos> And after Saint-Etienne, He also gave you good luck.<eos> Luck deserted you for a moment, but if the rest go on, then you will soon serve the King's Majesty again.
- Hannah's got nothing to do with this.<eos> - She worked at the Bucket, she was there when I grilled her father, and she has issues with the rev.<eos> - But she didn't have issues with the Rust Bucket. Why destroy it?<eos> - Okay, let's get the bartender in here and see what we can find out.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - What was Hannah Driscoll doing for you?<eos> - Just bookkeeping, deposits, payroll, like that.<eos> - Does she have any reason not to like you?<eos> - Why?<eos> What did she say to you?
Look who's here.<eos> Hey. I, uh, brought that book, the one you said you wanted to borrow.<eos> Yeah!<eos> The book, right.<eos> Wow, isn't that nice.<eos> Thank you. Yeah, the kids can't wait for you to babysit again.<eos> Mom.<eos> I guess you made quite an impression.<eos> Mom.<eos> Okay, well, I guess I'll leave you two alone.
Look closer, in the background,<eos> - right here?<eos> - Birds?<eos> Or bats.<eos> I tried to tell doctor Carmel I had seen this before.<eos> - One summer all the Huli tribesmen started freaking out and came down with a fever;<eos> I got it too.<eos> I think I know what is happening but I need to be sure.<eos> - Henry?<eos> - Hey mom, hey dad, sorry I wake you up.
Release the gas.<eos> I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Desolation, frostbite.<eos> Must be Russia.<eos> Welcome to Volkoff Industries.<eos> I'm glad you could finally make it.<eos> Take a load off.<eos> Relax.<eos> And think about all the terrible things I will do to you.
A fear of balloons!<eos> That's the craziest thing I've ever bloody heard!<eos> Some wine for you.<eos> Sorry, I asked for red.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> No, no, no, leave it.<eos> Thishasbeen a success. I have had a lovely, lovely time.<eos> As thingy was saying earlier, it's easy to go unrecognised in a big corporation, so it's appreciated, it really is. Cheers.<eos> Don't raise yourglasses too soon, cos this ruse has also been a ruse.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, let meintroduce to you our new head ofhiring and firing, Ben Genderson.
- Hey, where's Tommy?<eos> - He's coming out.<eos> Did he get the grab?<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's the girl? - You're lookin' at her.<eos> - This?<eos> God bless you.
Did he get the grab?<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where's the girl? - You're lookin' at her.<eos> - This?<eos> God bless you.<eos> You saved Mary.<eos> God bless you.
I need to turn the system off and change out the hard drives.<eos> Sure, take your time.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Chief Monohan, you're under arrest.<eos> *** you can't think of one? Not one?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Think a little harder, sweetie.<eos> I am.<eos> All right, let me get this straight. You're going on a field trip with your school, and you don't know one of the parents' names that are chaperoning you?
No, something's not right.<eos> Lab come up with anything on the blood we found on the leaves?<eos> Not yet.<eos> All right, call them.<eos> I don't think Stan was the only one out there last night.<eos> Mom, this is ridiculous.<eos> Hey, you're not even supposed to be having visitors, you know.<eos> Although, if Andie hasn't caught it by now, I'm sure... mom!<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm keeping my eye on you two.
And it will not be long until our side retaliates.<eos> If someone else is involved in this, we have to stop her now.<eos> You can't afford to protect anyone-- she's my mother.<eos> What?<eos> Doc.<eos> Doc! You got that list?<eos> I need it now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, right here.<eos> Most are expecting you.
I was expecting a sneak attack.<eos> You know, it's usually best not to announce your arrival<eos> If you want to keep advantage.<eos> Well, I know better than to underestimate you like that.<eos> Where are your thralls?<eos> Or are you actually ready for a fair fight?<eos> Well, the ones who haven't blown themselves up yet.<eos> I thought we could use some privacy, a little girl talk.<eos> I agree.<eos> I came to officially ask you to stop your attacks.
That's another club.<eos> That's one of Jim's clubs.<eos> Mud cleats.<eos> You know, I know it's a free country, Rick, and I don't care what you guys do, but...<eos> Thanks, Nick.<eos> Next time I'm about to go down on a big juicy cock, I'll remember, it's all right with you.<eos> You should have that stamped on the head of the cock.<eos> "Nick-approved."<eos> Nick's face. "Nick-approved."<eos> Like I said, I don't care and God bless you.
This area's about to be sealed off as part of the curfew.<eos> I can take you to your bedrooms.<eos> The Shansheeth are holding a gathering of remembrance.<eos> Just watch it, you. But you see?<eos> So bright!<eos> You smell of time. What do you mean?<eos> He's coming!<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> The Claw Shansheeth invites you to spend tonight reflecting in the memories of a loved one lost.
So how's it feel to play second fiddle to the best house in Harlem?<eos> Second fiddle, my ass.<eos> We were here first. Here.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Better get a phone number out of this.<eos> His or mine?<eos> I'm a priest!<eos> This is my parish!<eos> Get her out.<eos> God bless you.
I understand.<eos> Don't you have fire insurance?<eos> The Catholic Church hardly has a pot to piss in, after all the bread we spent on lawyers and silenced those goddamn child molesters.<eos> They put us in the poorhouse, which is probably where we belong.<eos> You know, padre, I really don't think we can help you out.<eos> I mean, we just put out the fires and save the people, you know.<eos> No sweat, fellas.<eos> I'm not trying to put my hands in anybody's pockets...<eos> Unlike those pocket-pool perverts I was talking about a minute ago.<eos> May God protect you from every danger and bless your families, especially in your absence.
We work the same hours you do.<eos> Uh, father.<eos> Quick question.<eos> - If you had to say...<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I think that the padre might have an opinion in the matter, and I'd like to know who do you think has a better shot at being a doctor... a black man or a Puerto Rican?<eos> Puerto Rican.<eos> No question.<eos> But bless you all... black guys, Puerto Rican guys, even you Irish knuckleheads.
So beautiful, so... peaceful.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> We've got 1 minute 15, Your Highness!<eos> So if you could just make the order and bring everyone back?<eos> Your king commands you.<eos> Our king commands us.<eos> Take me home and bring the humans back to earth.<eos> Clyde, Rani, thank you.<eos> Earth was never my home, not really.<eos> But it is your home and you're lucky to have people that love you here.
Ok. [nervous chuckle]<eos> So, uh... can I call you tomorrow?<eos> I kept having this feeling that something was gonna happen.<eos> And then at spirit quest... It happened.<eos> It's just... It's so hard To like be around someone, and have to pretend you don't feel what you feel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's worth it.<eos> To feel like this.<eos> You have to be smart about this.<eos> - I know that. - I'm just saying. I did see you in the woods.
Cody.<eos> Hey.<eos> How'd you guys get here?<eos> We walked.<eos> Don't be mad, Dexter.<eos> They wanted to see where it happened.<eos> Where they lost their mother.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Astor, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.<eos> I should have brought you back here, like you asked.
If they need anything, just let me know; I'll send it.<eos> We will. Thank you.<eos> I lost my innocence at such an early age.<eos> And it left a very damaging mark.<eos> Can't I stay with you, Dexter?<eos> For now, you need to go with your grandparents.<eos> Don't worry, we'll still see each other all the time.<eos> Orlando's not so far.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Any shrink could tell you that's why I've always liked children.
We have to get the Generalissimo.<eos> Chuck, the gun!<eos> Chuck?<eos> Sis, you okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we're good, man. That was awesome, Chuck.<eos> Good.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Casey, get us out of here.<eos> If you can get to the basement, I can get you out.
Um, listen, we have a few questions regarding these Halloween decorations.<eos> Um, what are we allowed to show?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know a really good morgue that gives discounts on unclaimed merchandise.<eos> Maybe we could sprinkle some cold, dead ones in here.<eos> Right.<eos> No, I'm gonna say no on the dead bodies.<eos> So, what, I just lose my deposit?<eos> Okay, look, here's the thing:<eos> I put you in charge of decorating the store so I can get it off my plate, so you're just gonna have to figure it out for me, okay?
Okay, you were just looking at me...<eos> This is from our Swiss field op, which, by the way, I just love saying.<eos> His name is Anand Chanarong, an aide to the Thai ambassador but he is also a known associate of one...<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Baddie the Belgian.<eos> He handles all the Belgian's dirty work. Extortion, kidnapping. And he's in L.A. At the Thai embassy.<eos> Which is Thai soil. It's not in our jurisdiction.<eos> - We don't have jurisdiction, Walker.<eos> - Come on, Casey. Be a spy.<eos> Who told you to bring this in here?
All right, you know what, everybody, huddle up!<eos> Come on, huddle up. Math: All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> You don't mind, right?<eos> Be my guest. Come on, girls.<eos> Come on, bring it in.<eos> Bring it in. Bring it in. Bring it in, bring it in.<eos> Okay. Tomorrow we are going into our first game against the maplewood marmots.<eos> And I know what you're thinking.<eos> They beat you last year in what some might call a massacre.
I felt like I had to be that guy to her.<eos> 'Cause if I wasn't... She wouldn't have marry me.<eos> Now, who knows?<eos> She knew what she was getting.<eos> A guy just like everybody else.<eos> The night on your deck, the day of the wedding... She might've chosen you.<eos> No, she wouldn't have.<eos> She loves you, Ryan.<eos> Trust me, she's told me that many, many times.<eos> You guys were both afraid of the same thing... that whatever was going on on your wedding day was gonna drive you apart, it was gonna make the other one jump ship.
My client has already told you he doesn't know that man.<eos> My client has already told you he didn't make this video, nor any of the others you've alluded to.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> Can you see my client's face on the other videos?<eos> Because I certainly can't see it in this one.<eos> In every video, the person who made it took great care to keep himself off camera.<eos> Then, I will ask you again: What are we doing here?<eos> Late yesterday, our Computer Crimes Division was able to trace the IP address of the hard drive the perpetrator used to upload most of his videos.<eos> Turns out they came from a public access computer at the Saguaro Branch Public Library.<eos> I assume that that library is familiar to you.
We don't want to pick him up unless and until he makes a move on that woman, so we can arrest him.<eos> Everybody copies that.<eos> We're just waiting on your signal.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> It's all right, you haven't missed anything.<eos> What's with the entourage?<eos> Joe's out of town.<eos> I couldn't find anyone to take them to school.<eos> Okay, remember what I told you:
Same thing. I can't sleep.<eos> Nightmares, nothing but nightmares.<eos> Lee, how long can this go on?<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I've seen three doctors, taken all kinds of pills.<eos> I want what you want-- I want to sleep.<eos> I want to get some rest.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry, Mr. Good, Mrs. Good,<eos> Baby Good.<eos> Am I keeping you up?
Stop it!<eos> Let go!<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> You're under arrest for murder.<eos> I didn't kill that man.<eos> I suppose you didn't kill the kidnapper at the trailer park, either.<eos> And they're not kidnappers.<eos> They're part of my team.<eos> And whoever did kill 'em is playing us all.<eos> He said, "The kidnappers are playing all of you."
This way.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Micha!<eos> What's up brother?<eos> Timur! What a suprise!<eos> We're looking for Hadji.<eos> Have you seen him around?<eos> Don't move! I will ash you son.
- I love you.<eos> - Ok, I love you too<eos> Did I miss anything?<eos> The ceremony just started.<eos> Alright, I want everyone tailed after the ceremony.<eos> OK.<eos> My dear friends.<eos> You have come together at this church so did the lord may seal and strengthen in your love. In the presence of this church is minister and this community.<eos> Christ aboundedly blesses this love.<eos> He has already consecrated you in baptism.
She thought she did.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Nobody else saw it, so you draw your own conclusions.<eos> Are you calling her a liar?<eos> Well, where did it go? Beaverland?<eos> - Ray: Guys.<eos> - Maybe one of your fat friends ate the beaver.<eos> Yeah, or maybe mom ate one of your stupid scones and hallucinated it.<eos> Guys, guys, knock it off.<eos> What's up with you two?
Somebody will report it to the police.<eos> Right?<eos> There's a high probability of that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - l see.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> Huh?<eos> Amongst us is there anybody who while watching thought of reporting for even an instant?<eos> That's about it.<eos> But things would be different if a viewer knows you.
Anyway, it is now time for us to decide which of these cars is best.<eos> Quite easy for me, the Maserati is idiotic, OK?<eos> After five minutes it would drive you mad, and after five weeks it would fall to pieces.<eos> But for me, by a country mile, it's the one I'd have.<eos> Me too.<eos> Yeah, and me, by a long, long way.<eos> Yeah, so there we are, we all agree on something.<eos> The worst car is the best.<eos> And on both those bombshell, it's now time to end.<eos> Thank you for watching. Not that you were, because you were watching the football, but there we are.
We let things die down, And then we do what we were brought together to do.<eos> Which is what exactly?<eos> Exchange briefcases, of course. You want to tell me where yours is?<eos> - It's somewhere safe.<eos> - This is somewhere safe.<eos> That's why they call it a safe house.<eos> Where else is safe?<eos> - It got hot.<eos> I had to drop it, so...<eos> That's how they teach you in the cia?
I'm wearing my jammies.<eos> In my dream, I usually just wear my underwear.<eos> "To sleep, perchance to dream."<eos> Ah. There's the rub.<eos> Or is it?<eos> Perhaps the real rub is not knowing why humans must sleep, let alone why we dream when we do.<eos> Neuroscientists can explain what is happening in our brain when we sleep.<eos> However, they cannot explain why.<eos> Enter psychology.<eos> That's why I've asked you to keep a journal of your dreams.
It's always a pleasure doing business with you country fellas.<eos> Listen, if you ever need anything else, Here's my card.<eos> You can call collect. - Oh yes.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, social justice, was, is, and will be, the eternal power of our Mexico.<eos> This year we celebrate the bicentennial of our independence, And the centennial of the revolution, that gave us our country and our pride,<eos> And thanks to the enormous generosity of Don Jose and Doña Mari Reyes,<eos> Who, with the great hearts and great patriotism that God has given them, Have donated this wonderful school to our city.<eos> The whole community of San Miguel de Archangel, But even more, the youth of Mexico, who are the future of our country, are eternally grateful.<eos> May God Bless you, Señores Reyes!
What do you say?<eos> Think about it!<eos> You never know.<eos> Who knows what will happen?<eos> And someday, you might need me. So here you are.<eos> Remember also: It's better to be snitch number five than corpse number one.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Fucking Federales.<eos> You two are nothing but a pair of ungrateful bastards.<eos> Have you forgotten who put you in your positions? Fucking sneaky bastards.
I should probably go thank them for the champagne.<eos> I should probably thank them, too.<eos> Here they come.<eos> I still don't see how they're gonna believe this is a business dinner at Le Privilege.<eos> The idea is to act like we have nothing to hide.<eos> Hi!<eos> Steve, Chloe, what a lovely surprise.<eos> - Thanks for the champagne.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> So, what brings the two of you to such a romantic restaurant?
- My pleasure.<eos> So, what brings the two of you to such a romantic restaurant?<eos> I wanted to bring my gym manager out to thank her for all her hard work.<eos> Really? And what about Kim?<eos> You don't appreciate her hard work as much as Summer's?<eos> Here I am!<eos> I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> Traffic was a bear!<eos> Steve, Chloe.<eos> What special occasion brings you out to such a nice restaurant?
Sorry.<eos> I can't undo what I did and whatever happened, but I can just start now and try to...<eos> - Mr. and Mrs. Gavin.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Hey.<eos> - Joey?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I work here.<eos> They sent me out because I said I knew you.
No contact.<eos> Tommy, Franco was nothing.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Lips... big, gorgeous girl lips.<eos> You don't have to tell me about the lips.<eos> And pretty eyes and long lashes.<eos> All right, I haven't spent that much time looking at his eyeballs, but, you know.<eos> Ok... Tommy, he was pretty.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Look. Um, what you had with Sheila, you know, the two of you turning to each other in grief after Jimmy...
FBI Agent Jack Franklin is currently a fugitive.<eos> An FBI Agent's on the run?<eos> He used to work here in the white collar branch.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> Not well. He transferred in from the Chicago office a couple years ago, then he got bumped down to internal bank fraud.<eos> Isn't that the siberia of assignments?<eos> Maybe the bureau should've fired him instead.<eos> U.S. marshals caught him... trying to access their witness database.<eos> Wow. Deckard, do you want to coordinate the search?<eos> Justice department insisted we loop you in.
Peter.<eos> He's upstairs in the conference room.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> If it's a canvas commentary, why would he use white...<eos> Burke.<eos> Any leads?<eos> Deckard...<eos> A little heads-up when you're on your way over here.<eos> Hey, what did Franklin's c.I. Say to you?
- Oh, come on.<eos> You don't hold our last meeting against me?<eos> A girl doesn't forget somebody trying to make her kill herself.<eos> Oh, yeah, right.<eos> Bad move.<eos> I'll make her kill you next time.<eos> Speaking of killing, Dyson offed a very dear friend of mine.<eos> Yeah, well, from what we hear, your dear friend was a psycho.<eos> It's not nice to speak ill of the dead.<eos> Did Dyson tell you about the relationship he and Ba'al had before?
You were reluctant to come here today, weren't you, sister?<eos> My mother superior forbade it, and, well, I didn't think I had anything relevant to say.<eos> Sister Theresa, what happens to the soul of someone who commits suicide?<eos> That soul goes to hell.<eos> Were you reluctant to come here because it meant you'd have to testify that your father might have committed suicide?<eos> Based on the things he told you, based on the letter, isn't it possible?<eos> May God have mercy on his soul and have mercy on me for not coming to my sister's aid sooner. Yes.<eos> Hello, sister.<eos> Could you please read the... the last paragraph from that letter?<eos> "I'm sorry for everything I've done, everything I've put you through."
You can't do that from out here.<eos> Minister, are you all right?<eos> I feel faint.<eos> Oh, do you have a-a first-aid room or a back office?<eos> Y-yes, yes, yes. Through that door.<eos> Oh, I do not feel well.<eos> There's shrimp in this!<eos> You really can't tell?<eos> Americans!<eos> Every accent sounds the same to you.
I dropped by to say hello, he's all alone.<eos> He was surrounded by other Satanists.<eos> And he said to destroy us if we got in your way.<eos> Yeah but you didn't hear the rest of the conversation. Okay, where I said now I'm a gang member, and being a gang member is more important to me than being a Satanist.<eos> (Hannah) My trust in authority has been shattered.<eos> For the record, I never trusted you, Atticus!<eos> I bet you're the reason for my father's disappearance!<eos> Kids!<eos> It's me, Atticus.<eos> Sure I may have deceived you, I, I spied on you and perhaps turned the other way when you were in mortal danger, but, I'm a gang member.
It will be dangerous.<eos> I urge you to speak before the full senate.<eos> I'll need some time to prepare.<eos> Good.<eos> In the meantime, I'll pay another visit to those still undecided.<eos> I'll be parked just over there, my lady. Thank you.<eos> This way, uncle.<eos> What does ideology matter at this point?<eos> Is it worth being beaten to death?<eos> Look at what they did to you.
But what's the matter?<eos> You all look very somber.<eos> Senator, the fleet protecting Ryloth has been destroyed, and the supply lines have been cut.<eos> The troops are out of food, fuel, ammunition, and the civilian population is starving.<eos> That is grim news.<eos> Our blockade runners should be able to penetrate the Separatist lines and drop relief supplies, but they do not have the range to reach Ryloth.<eos> The planet Toydaria is 2,000 parsecs closer than the nearest fleet.<eos> If the blockade runners can supply from there, they might reach Ryloth in time.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> We've dispatched a ship loaded with relief supplies to meet you on Toydaria.
But if you won't listen to me, wise king, listen to Senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth, who is well aware of the suffering of his people.<eos> Your Highness, our cities lie in ruins.<eos> Our transportation hubs are all but destroyed, so I cannot return home.<eos> Our crops burn.<eos> The Twi'lek people are starving, and they will die if no aid comes to them.<eos> I appeal to you, great king.<eos> The basic tenets of our morality, and even our constitution, demand that we help those in need.<eos> Those ideals are noble, but we must be careful that our compassion does not draw us into this war.<eos> Senator Dod, if you please.<eos> Great king, Senator Organa is deceiving you.
Bring the recording you took of the black market deal and all the cadets who know about it.<eos> Korkie, you seem distracted today.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We did what you said.<eos> We found evidence of corruption.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, we were hungry, so we decided to go look for food.<eos> - Food? - Yeah.<eos> Down at the government warehouse.<eos> Someone just let you in to inspect the warehouse?
I'm only saying that you should take this slowly.<eos> Examine all of the facts and all of the people involved before you act.<eos> You sound more like my aunt than a Jedi Knight.<eos> You Korkie?<eos> Prime Minister, is that you?<eos> Secret Service. You are all under arrest for treason, corruption, and conspiracy.<eos> You will come with us.<eos> These are the same guards we saw last night.<eos> We've done nothing wrong.<eos> Looks like the Prime Minister set you up.
That was never supposed to happen.<eos> Two networks, one server.<eos> My mind cannot take the level of data being, as Ms. Donovan would put it, downloaded.<eos> Eventually, it will overload.<eos> And by overload, you mean...<eos> There is another difficulty.<eos> As Warehouse 2 continues to eclipse my bond, Warehouse 13 will begin to... To die.<eos> So we need to find Warehouse 2 and shut it down.<eos> I'll call the Regents.<eos> They will send an expert to meet you in Egypt, who will help you with Warehouse 2.
How did you come and go so easily last time?<eos> Through the wall.<eos> There is no wall.<eos> Okay.<eos> The Broken aren't as clueless as we thought.<eos> Okay, so when people say, "There is no wall," what does that mean?<eos> I mean, I've seen it with my own two eyes.<eos> We all have.<eos> Like everything else at Tower Prep, you see what they want you to see.<eos> Or rather, what Whisper tells you to see.
So nobody coerced her to get a confession.<eos> Is she saying somebody did?<eos> Doesn't matter what she said, I don't want you getting hurt.<eos> Maura killed her girls because they were keeping her from a rich boyfriend.<eos> She confessed and the arson report backed it up.<eos> End of story.<eos> End of story.<eos> You're off to a great start, Mr. Dekker.<eos> A case fabricated by the husband of a cop who helped frame my client six years ago.<eos> Will the D.D.A. who played footsies with the judge be helping you?
We are so relieved to see you, we got locked in.<eos> Are you the one doing the security upgrade?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we're just running perimeter tests.<eos> I thought the museum was going to be empty, is this your whole group?<eos> Oh, yeah, this is Henry Griffin, Maggie Winnik,<eos> Tram Van Horne.<eos> Tram's actually the one who got me turned onto Graphicon.<eos> Hey we're checking it out on Sunday.<eos> Ah, or we might go rock climbing.<eos> Well, whatever you end up doing, ah is anybody waiting on you?
Sarah, if you know something, you have to tell them.<eos> I'm so sorry I lied to you.<eos> Last call came in an hour ago, and the man on the end said that if we paid the money, we'd get Robin back.<eos> As soon as the kidnappers made contact,<eos> Michael called Mr. Ellison.<eos> He flew in with the money.<eos> He monitored all the calls. He told Michael exactly what to do and say.<eos> Did your husband say where the transaction was taking place?<eos> No, no. Mr. Ellison wouldn't let him give me any details.<eos> Did Ellison ask you to lie?
That's good.<eos> It worked.<eos> Yeah, I hope so.<eos> There were clubs in Boston you could go on they're open-mike nights.<eos> You could just-- Anytime you wanted to.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm sorry, were we bothering you guys back there?<eos> Yeah, actually, you were.<eos> That's why I asked you to be quiet and you did, so thank you.
- Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe I deserve all this.<eos> But I need you to make me feel like I don't.<eos> Alisha... I didn't mean that.<eos> Alisha?<eos> And don't even think about using your power to fix this.<eos> I want to know what a prick you can be.<eos> I don't even remember having that done.<eos> Yeah, neither do I. I don't regret it, though.<eos> I think the tattoos are controlling you.
We were told she used to work at the... restaurant<eos> In santa monica, right?<eos> Right.<eos> santa monica... that's where we met.<eos> Must have been a big shock to you When she told you she was pregnant.<eos> it was.<eos> And the blood test for genetic diseases... Dr. Weinstein in pasadena did those? Yes.<eos> It says here rebecca's r.<eos> H. Negative, So you must be r. H. Negative too.<eos> Is that what dr. Weinstein told you?
Powell's got priors, possession for sale.<eos> Nothing violent. Well, he's in the majors now.<eos> Meth lab elevates these homicides to murder.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> Ronnie must have come through here to answer the front door.<eos> Left some meth cooking in the garage.<eos> Looks like our boy's packing.<eos> Check out what he left behind.<eos> Those don't look like plastic frames to me. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I told you they had... Dark frames and like, black lenses.
Wouldn't a good wife ask her husband's permission before doing such a thing?<eos> You wanted to be a good wife, Amy.<eos> So you got Terry's permission before trying to kill Ronnie, correct?<eos> He asked you a question, Miss Powell.<eos> It's all right, Your Honor.<eos> She doesn't have to answer.<eos> Whatever your feelings about Amy Powell, whether pity or contempt, her testimony raises reasonable doubt.<eos> And if that's not reason enough to acquit my clients, let me give you another more compelling one.<eos> You were denied your right as a jury to hear all the evidence.<eos> Mr. Dekker prevented you from hearing evidence that my clients were motivated by the killing of Muslim innocents, by collateral damage from American artillery,
Here it comes.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> The shadow.<eos> A total eclipse of the Sun.<eos> Few people who see one will ever forget it.<eos> Personally witnessing a total solar eclipse, in the flesh, is an amazing, awe-inspiring, tremendously moving experience.<eos> I've never experienced anything quite like it.<eos> Some, like astronomer Glenn Schneider, are part of a subculture of globe-hopping eclipse chasers who will go anywhere, anytime to see an eclipse.<eos> It grips you, because the sky has gone dark, not as dark as midnight, but like a very deep twilight.<eos> And you can see this eyeball looking down at you.
We don't give rides.<eos> All right.<eos> You don't have anybody you can call to come pick you up, man?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Do you have any money on you for a taxi?<eos> No, sir.<eos> We can't just leave him here.<eos> Well, I can give him money for a taxi if he'd use it.<eos> Here's $20.<eos> Oh, God bless you.
Even when we go to trade the Rashi, we need one.<eos> We don't have a clearance, but I believe that my father's there, and I need to find him.<eos> Well... We-we can get you to the outland gate, but we can't enter.<eos> Oh, that would be great.<eos> Just get us close, and we'll do the rest.<eos> I'll get water for the journey.<eos> Let us help you. No!<eos> Please...<eos> Enjoy the harvest.<eos> The Rashi is good for you.
- ...because I know -<eos> - So you like it?<eos> But I don't like it.<eos> But if you guys like it, then let's go with this one.<eos> Maybe it'll end up being a B-side.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Who knows?<eos> Come see Kenny-fucking-Powers tonight at Charros Stadium.<eos> He's the Hombre Negro, not the White Flame.<eos> He's not scary like the negros in America unless you're the competition then he'll strike you out and shit all over your face.
I have Sebastian's blessing and I was hoping to get yours.<eos> But why?<eos> I don't even know what baseball means to you anymore.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> I'd be lying if I said I wasn't here primarily to play for the scout that is rumored to be here tonight.<eos> But there's also a very small part of me - Yet significant part. - That would always regret how I left things here with the team.<eos> No.<eos> Okay?<eos> Team, Roger Benji, bat boy I genuinely am sorry.<eos> I brought you guys up from less than fucking nothing and took you up to a championship level, only to abandon you there.
And when you called the arraignment clerk, that... that was also a mistake?<eos> Well, again, in hindsight, yes.<eos> And getting Murray Rothstein out of jail... another mistake?<eos> Uh, clearly.<eos> And, uh, this eavesdropping warrant that you authorized... Yet another mistake?<eos> Well, I don't remember.<eos> Perhaps it was.<eos> May I see that?<eos> You know, obviously, Ms. Peale, if we could do it all over again, you and I would do it... differently.<eos> They told you about cash bribes, but they found no money.
We can get high. Yeah, I think I'll pass.<eos> Have fun sitting on the bench this season.<eos> Okay, but if you change your mind, I mean, it's tonight at the Goat House.<eos> Bring your friends.<eos> Dreams!<eos> Hello, caller.<eos> Dreams!<eos> Oh, hello. I'm Radon Randell. You're watching Dreams.<eos> Every Saturday, I inspire you on the field.<eos> Now let me inspire you in your everyday life.
Now, wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?<eos> Instead, he keeps them in the dark.<eos> He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.<eos> It's an execution.<eos> It's easy to see why he sets fires down here. It's completely isolated.<eos> He can beat, torture, or burn somebody and nobody would hear it.<eos> I never thought the FBI would be here for our fine city's tradition.<eos> I'm Al Garner with the DFD.<eos> Agents Morgan and Prentiss.<eos> I guess Devil's Night keeps you pretty busy, huh?
And with cataracts to boot.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> Hey. You leave me alone with him, You might come home to find out you've got a new daddy.<eos> Hi, I'm Marty, and I'm an overeater.<eos> Hi, Marty.<eos> Since I've been in the program, I've lost 12 and a half pounds.<eos> Bite me, Marty.<eos> Anyway, it's been a really inspiring week for me. I finished third in the Chicago triathlon, My new abs video is selling like gangbusters.<eos> Look at me, I can do a sit-up.<eos> And best of all, I got engaged to that beautiful swimsuit model I was telling you about last week...
Are you sure this is going to work?<eos> It just did.<eos> Hey.<eos> We were informed of this witness just this morning, judge.<eos> Judge, we just found this witness.<eos> How is he pertinent, Mr. Kaczmarek?<eos> Mr. Guzman has working knowledge of casino targeting, and specifically, knowledge of Leonard Jackson and the Moroccan.<eos> We'd request time to investigate.<eos> I will save you the effort.<eos> Mr. Guzman will tell you that he specifically targeted my client traveling as far as Oklahoma to drag him back to Mr. briar's client, accepting cash kickbacks in the process.
Why is Betty always the only one with store spirit?<eos> What's Thursday? Thanksgiving.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I forgot.<eos> How could you forget Thanksgiving?<eos> We don't really think of it as Thanksgiving.<eos> We think of it as the only Thursday of the year we don't have to work.<eos> Well, that and Senior Skip Day, which my dad still celebrates.<eos> Now, we will start employing subliminal directions.<eos> If somebody asks you where the cereal is, you tell them,
Which is why you might be more comfortable Traveling to your own country, where he can--<eos> All right. All right. Quiet.<eos> Quiet, please. Quiet, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I understand that there are a lot of concerns And agendas here.<eos> But we all have the same goal, And that is to see this man live.<eos> Now we are out of time, which means we are out of options.<eos> I am your only shot, and you have to take me.<eos> I can only say that if you knew me better... You'd feel pretty good about your chances.<eos> Dr. Hunt and I are going to operate, And we will update you as soon as we can.
No, you didn't.<eos> I know you're just here to see if I'm okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Down by ground zero. So it's an anti-terror case?<eos> Ask me a question I can answer.<eos> Come on. You gotta fill in the blanks.<eos> I'm working three cases right now.<eos> If my cover was blown on one of them, I need to know which one it is.<eos> I never asked you to investigate.
...and personalized funeral services at affordable prices.<eos> My name is Wayne Lundgren.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Wayne Lundgren.<eos> Wayne Lundgren.<eos> Good work, hand.<eos> No, I've never seen this girl before.<eos> You say she's gone missing?<eos> My condolences to her family.<eos> But, uh, I still don't understand what brings you here.
Hi, ranger Pete.<eos> Hi, ranger Pete.<eos> Today, we'll learn all about these amazing evergreens and its fragile ecosystem.<eos> That should be fun.<eos> But first, we have a very special guess.<eos> It's Woodsy Owl.<eos> - Oh boy, Woodsy Owl!<eos> - Who's that?<eos> "Give a hoot, don't pollute."<eos> Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl. Reminding you all to please pick up your trash and keep our forest clean.
Even bad ones.<eos> Now, it's just the three of us against all of Wakanda, HYDRA, and a super-villain.<eos> That's how much faith I have in you two.<eos> Come on, I've dealt with HYDRA before.<eos> And Wakanda, not a problem.<eos> Okay, maybe a little problem.<eos> And that is only scratching the surface of the metal's potential.<eos> An army equipped with these could...<eos> It'll do.<eos> Baron Strucker and HYDRA thank you for your openness, Your Highness.
- Batman, we're ready to use what you taught us, or why Teach us at all?<eos> - Why let them tell us what to do?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Get on board or get out of the way.<eos> - This cave was the original secret sanctuary Of the Justice League.<eos> We're calling it into service again.<eos> Since you 4 are determined to stay together and fight The good fight, you'll do it on League terms.<eos> Red Tornado volunteered to live here and be Your supervisor.<eos> Black canary's in charge of training.<eos> I will deploy you on missions.
Oh, so you're paying now?<eos> - Figure of speech.<eos> - What's the matter with you this morning?<eos> Two busboys and a waiter called in sick.<eos> I had to walk in the freezing rain because my bicycle was stolen.<eos> You want us to file a report?<eos> We might find it. If you're going to play detective, I'd prefer you find my car.<eos> Which was stolen a year ago and the reason I'm riding a bicycle in the first place.<eos> We'll have two breakfast specials.<eos> You'll have whatever I bring you and you'll like it.
Well, the man makes really good babies.<eos> My turn. come here, sweetie.<eos> There you go.<eos> There you are.<eos> There you go.<eos> Yeah. Hello, sweetie.<eos> Hello.<eos> I was good at it, too.<eos> Hey, come on, guys.<eos> I told you not to light 'em.
You will be called by the defence, and then you shall do business with the prosecution's counsel.<eos> So it may be as well for you to hear what may be put to you.<eos> I have already sworn that there was only enough water for four days, but ten to 13 days would be required to regain Jamaica.<eos> Which knowledge caused Captain Collingwood to call his crew about him to begin the throwing over of the slaves?<eos> Women and children first?<eos> 29th November.<eos> Eight o'clock in the evening, coinciding with the changing of the watch, when the maximum number of crew members were available... for the task.<eos> And how did it feel to perform such an act?<eos> I will not reproach myself for my obedience.<eos> And does your conscience reproach you?
With Samuel?<eos> I have been faithful to you!<eos> I cannot believe it to be so.<eos> I have given my thoughts over to this CONSTANTLY.<eos> I shall not condemn you for my... spurious offspring.<eos> I will accept the child as my own.<eos> He will inherit my entire estate, my title and my property.<eos> At least I shall keep my dignity in society, with you alongside me.<eos> So you will arrange our marriage according to your own delusion?<eos> You will allow me to have deceived you when I have never been anything but constant to you?
What has provoked him in this way?<eos> The session begins early.<eos> So?<eos> You'll tell me why your husband seeks to disown you?<eos> He is in the grip of an idea that Samuel is not his, that I am not faithful, but most of all...<eos> ..he insists that I love you.<eos> Despite how you must have... refuted every accusation?<eos> His fancies have pushed me here.<eos> But from such fancies, a truth comes, Will.<eos> I asked you once in vain to leave him.
Do you not think the apprehension of necessity justified when my crew themselves suffered such severity?<eos> Seven out of 17 died on their way to Jamaica, or after their arrival there.<eos> The ship's cargo and the crew died from want of sustenance.<eos> They did not die from want of a commander.<eos> Mr Garrow?<eos> Captain Collingwood, you were, until you took this command, a slave ship surgeon.<eos> 11 voyages as doctor.<eos> But none of them as captain of a slaver?<eos> No.<eos> Your inexperience did not trouble you?
Oh, come, be honest.<eos> The owners of the Zong choose it.<eos> The muster roll of the ship.<eos> It was your late nephew's name alongside you.<eos> Daniel, was his name?<eos> I had made assurances to my sister of his welfare.<eos> And hard to bear knowing he may still be alive, but for Collingwood's command.<eos> Was that the cause of your dispute?<eos> No?<eos> Daniel's unnecessary death did not distress and vex you?
Who is it?<eos> Hello?<eos> All the time I have been in position at the Royal Hotel, Garrow has not come near.<eos> And it is quite clear from my exchange with Lady Sarah that they have had the benefit of the advice of the attorney, Southouse.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> You do not have to burst through a door and discover them in flagrante. No, sir.<eos> I must simply find someone who can identify them together and testify as to their intimacy.<eos> The hotel staff are willing but have not...<eos> I am not interested in your difficulties, Mr Farmer, only in your progress in my case.<eos> Jasker accuses you of an unnatural crime against him and you tell me you do not know why he does so.
Then, Captain Jones, I will be plain with you.<eos> In my life I am in some difficulty.<eos> Ruinous accusations have been made against me.<eos> Perhaps not as ruinous as the prospect of losing my life but it may not be worth living if it goes against me.<eos> The accusations are false.<eos> They are a lie.<eos> I am charged with committing adultery with another man's wife.<eos> I have not, but I have yearned to,<eos> do yearn to still.<eos> Your secret torments you.
Captain Jones came into my shop.<eos> A buckle had come away from his shoes.<eos> We went into the workshop.<eos> Captain Jones pushed me over and pulled down my breeches.<eos> And what next?<eos> He... he assaulted me. In what way?<eos> In a way that is very difficult to speak of.<eos> But you must speak of it if we are to have a verdict.<eos> I cannot.<eos> Did he penetrate you?
And against which virtue seeks vengeance.<eos> I understand and sympathise, Mr Jasker, with your reticence.<eos> Then may we try this another way?<eos> The man who abused you so cruelly and unnaturally, who made use of your body for his own depraved pleasure, is he here today?<eos> If that man is with us today, will you point him out in court?<eos> You will identify him or not, sir?<eos> Is the man in the dock?<eos> The man you accuse of sodomy?<eos> Yes.<eos> OUTCRY Did he sodomise you?
Do you, madam?<eos> I could never, I will never!<eos> Of course not.<eos> He had a rag stuffed in his mouth.<eos> Though curiously your husband did not mention that in his evidence.<eos> He hardly spoke.<eos> And how you do remedy that.<eos> I only say what he could not bring himself to.<eos> I put it to you that you describe far more than you saw.<eos> That what you did see was your husband in the company of Captain Jones in a way that did enrage and threaten you?
My lord!<eos> I require advice. On the penalty for perjury.<eos> If you speak of perjury then you do not choose me.<eos> I cannot let him die.<eos> That is the only choice I make.<eos> This is most irregular.<eos> Mr Silvester, speak to your client.<eos> You've lost me!<eos> But I think I had lost you some while ago!<eos> I ask you again, did Captain Jones assault you?
Having examined these complaints, we find they appear generally malicious and void of foundation...<eos> Gentlemen, I am no malicious informer... ..and tending to disturb the peace and good government of the hospital.<eos> But, sirs, I only conceived of it as the duty of my office to disclose any fraud or abuse to you.<eos> We have laid a copy of our findings before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.<eos> At sea, I would always place the interests of my men above my own, and on land I merely do the same.<eos> It is submitted to their lordships that it is expedient for the peace, quiet, and regular conducting of the business of the hospital that you be removed from your employment as Lieutenant Governor.<eos> I will not prostrate myself before you to keep my position.<eos> But I must inform you that I shall write to the General Court of Governors to make the facts known in print.<eos> Gentleman, this is a libel, a libel on you all.<eos> But further than that it criminates you, accuses you of fraud and pecuniary abuses.
Sirs, I am a poor individual, no fortune and unconnected.<eos> I am in an unequal contest between myself and those officers that govern.<eos> Yes, yes, you are.<eos> And your removal was agreed by the Admiralty?<eos> The whole weight of the Ministry thrown into the unequal balance against me.<eos> This will be a high privilege. To repel and expose so odious a prosecution.<eos> In truth, I only wish the reinstatement of my position.<eos> Beware.<eos> Beware of what, Mr Southouse?<eos> What it is that draws you to this case.
What it is that draws you to this case.<eos> Injustice always exerts its influence upon me.<eos> I mean do not come upon this personally.<eos> Come upon it as a man of the law!<eos> You wish to see me?<eos> We wish to visit you, sir.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> But are well acquainted with Captain Baillie.<eos> He is known to every man here.<eos> He recommended you as a good source of enquiry.
Will?<eos> Yes, Mr Southouse?<eos> We have business at Newgate.<eos> Why don't you attend it?<eos> It is the trial of Captain Baillie tomorrow.<eos> Well, then I will attend it tomorrow.<eos> I understand what this reunion would mean to you.<eos> But I would deprive myself of the means to defend the suit against me.<eos> If you sign this affidavit, it becomes evidence in court of my treachery.<eos> That is why the child is being offered to you!
I suppose I should be grateful for this support.<eos> Let us not exaggerate the transformation.<eos> I do not propose we become friends.<eos> For which I am also grateful.<eos> But I spy a second purpose to your offer - a purpose more in keeping with the Silvester I have known.<eos> To add the Crimcon as a source of income to his balance sheet, a barrister such as yourself must set up stall in that market with a sensational trial.<eos> This is such a trial.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But do my motives for taking such a case have any bearing on the very good job I might do for you and for Lady Sarah?<eos> You wish me to persuade you?
That I also recall... more distantly.<eos> Well, no doubt it is a familiar enough tale? And the symmetry of our two roles in it might ease your conscience.<eos> Except that the tale is not true.<eos> I say to you what, as a woman and a wife, I am prevented from saying in my defence in a court of law.<eos> My husband was not driven into your arms by any betrayal on my part.<eos> Well, so you would say.<eos> Because it is the truth.<eos> There was no seduction by William Garrow.<eos> Nor any gift of a bastard son?<eos> I see my husband has infected you with an ounce of his madness!
We have no questions, My Lord.<eos> Court shall rise.<eos> You have a verdict, gentlemen?<eos> We do, My Lord.<eos> The jury find for the plaintiff, Sir Arthur Hill.<eos> And award damages to the amount of... one shilling.<eos> Court shall rise.<eos> Splendid, Garrow.<eos> And now perhaps, please God, we can resume our former opposition.<eos> I believe I have something that belongs to you.
The serving girl - she is your accomplice?<eos> I enchanted her, too.<eos> The girl is entirely innocent.<eos> My lord, he has confessed.<eos> Release the girl.<eos> Tomorrow at dawn you will take her place on the pyre.<eos> Take him away.<eos> Do you know that man, Gaius?<eos> I've never seen him before.<eos> Is there something troubling you, Morgana?
I could hear sex coming from Sam's room.'<eos> Right, that's got to stop.<eos> Right, I'm sorry, guys, but I'm not going to allow this high-energy nailing under my roof.<eos> I know you're both adults. You especially, Brian.<eos> But them's the rules...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> I thought I could hear Brian nailing you. What?<eos> And you thought you'd come in and watch?<eos> Why, would that be OK with you both?
Nothing.<eos> Then all is lost.<eos> We will be massacred.<eos> Every last one of us.<eos> Not everyone has to die.<eos> What do you mean, "not everyone"?<eos> Those that defy them - those that choose to fight - they will surely die.<eos> But those who do not resist, those who choose to welcome change... They will have a future here.<eos> Everyone has a choice, Gwen.<eos> You know I have always been loyal to you, Morgana.
Merlin.'<eos> From the moment it touched my lips, I could feel my life return to me.<eos> Cenred is our sworn enemy. We cannot risk him getting his hands on the Cup of Life.<eos> Why does Uther fear it so much?<eos> The Cup can be used for evil AND good.<eos> Not so great Cenred's got it, then.<eos> It's worse than you can imagine.<eos> With the Cup, Camelot would soon be at our mercy.<eos> You march with the mightiest weapon of them all - immortality.<eos> I have always been loyal to you, Morgana.
You'll get your wish... ..but not yet.<eos> I still want you to suffer as I suffered. To know what it is like to be alone and afraid, to be disgusted with who and what you are...<eos> Do you really hate me so much?<eos> You cannot begin to know how much I hate you.<eos> It's rat.<eos> Oh, believe me, you've eaten far worse.<eos> I've served you things I would never have touched, but you wolfed them down, no problem.<eos> Merlin, for once, leave me in peace. Please.<eos> I understand.<eos> Your father lied to you about Morgana - I don't know why, I'm sure he had his reasons - but now is not the time for that. He is still your father.
In other words, Cody Dennis is not guilty unless he knew the serial numbers were missing.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Young man, you impressed me.<eos> I'm proud of what you did in there.<eos> Hey, Cody, just, uh, give us one second, will you?<eos> Do not confuse my legal arguments with what I believe in.<eos> I have one purpose, and that's keeping your grandson out of prison.<eos> The problem with you idealists, all you care about are your ideals.<eos> You ignore the people in front of you.
No offense, but your girlfriend leaving town really screwed me.<eos> - I mean, I'm happy for the children of Malawi and all...<eos> - Yeah, no, you should be worried for them.<eos> Right now she's making them fall in love with her.<eos> "Oh, I'll uncleft your palate," "I'll unherniate your hernia, I'm here for you."<eos> - "I'm yours."<eos> - Yeah, and then someplace better will come along...<eos> Mm-hmm. Peru or India...<eos> and suddenly she's all...<eos> "I know I was helping you"
He does everything.<eos> He does everything.<eos> Mm, I don't make the rules.<eos> And well, I'm glad I didn't cancel because it's fantastic to be here seeing your happy smiley faces, probably feeling very fortunate that you managed to get a ticket to see a living legend. - Or am I...<eos> Shut up.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> You lucky fuckers.<eos> You really... I'm joking, of course.<eos> The pleasure is all mine.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out, spending your hard-earned cash.
Mr. Amanjit, come quickly, they're upsetting Solomon.<eos> Stop screaming, you'll make him worse.<eos> Oh, thank you, Mr. Amanjit.<eos> Poor Solomon.<eos> He'll need sweet tea.<eos> If there's nothing in the kitchen you must take him to a cabstand.<eos> Very good, madam.<eos> Every morning, as soon as he sees me open my eyes, he applauds me.<eos> I can't tell you how that boosts one's confidence.<eos> The monkey applauds you every morning?
I won't call you lady anything if you don't act like one.<eos> The thing is, Lady Persie, there are rules.<eos> And you have to stick to them, just as much as us.<eos> I'll get you!<eos> Agnes, dear, do speak to Mrs Thackeray about the marmalade.<eos> She only sends up thin-cut, and Solomon likes thick.<eos> I thought we'd agreed that you should breakfast in the morning room.<eos> Mr. Amanjit breakfasts in there on a tray.<eos> I gave instructions to Miss Buck.<eos> Did Persie tell you who we met at the Picasso private view?
Sara, it's a lighter.<eos> You can't kill yourself with a lighter.<eos> Listen.<eos> I don't despise you, or find you to be loathsome specimens.
- Tell me about it.<eos> They must have cost a fortune!<eos> Not really.<eos> I stole 'em.<eos> To my birthday girl.<eos> Thank you, sweetie.<eos> How do they look?<eos> Almost as beautiful as the woman who's wearing them.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> What brings you here?
Just breathe.<eos> Let's all remember that Captain Marvel here saved Carol's life and yours, Jan.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I'm also remembering that he's an alien spy, and just told us that his people are going to wipe out our planet.<eos> What is it you want, Marvel?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I want to help. I'm a scientist.<eos> A xenobiologist.<eos> I had heard rumors of genetic anomaly on Earth, and I came to investigate.<eos> I've been studying you for three years now.
I didn't mean to bring shield and stark down on you like this.<eos> But thanks.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> That's what being on a team means.<eos> I can't figure it out.<eos> Why'd she do it?<eos> Why'd Natasha save me?<eos> Tell me again what happened.<eos> As you were finishing off hawkeye, the black panther attacked.<eos> One of his energy daggers hit you.

Unlike you, it would appear.<eos> I've seen the result of those beliefs.<eos> In this house.<eos> And I have to live with that.<eos> No-one has to do anything, Harry.<eos> No-one has to accept the status quo.<eos> You mean you don't have to.<eos> People like you don't have any need for politics.<eos> Your world don't need to shift.<eos> Everything's golden, and nothing touches you.
PRQ have a track record of been uh...the hardest ISP you can find in the world.<eos> There's just no-one else that bothers less about lawyers harassing them, about content they are hosting.<eos> And it's just the attitude that, let's say, works very well with what WikiLeaks was set out to do.<eos> One reason why WikiLeaks need PRQ is that their operations are protected by Sweden's strict freedom of expression laws - laws which PRQ exploit to the full.<eos> And we aren't talking about any old information.<eos> It's from these servers at PRQ that WikiLeaks has, for example, made public a manual from the United States Guantanamo Bay detention centre.<eos> A military manual leaked on the internet is revealing details of the way terror suspects are being treated at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.<eos> It tells of the use of solitary confinement and humiliation to break down the detainees mentally.<eos> Human rights groups have for years been asking the US administration for access to this manual.<eos> If you censor important material of this type, we're not just gonna criticise you, we're going to take the material that you try to censor and we're going to spray it all over the world.
Where are you?<eos> You scared me.<eos> You'll wake Eun-soo up if you scream like that.<eos> I said stop screaming.<eos> Stop!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Shhh...<eos> Eun-soo!<eos> Have you ever had coffee with an angel?<eos> This program is brought to you by angels' choice of coffee, Angel-in-us
Mainly because I'm not convinced the Russians aren't hiding something.<eos> What, I don't know but at least I bought us some time to find it out.<eos> Oh by the way... your "extraterrestrial exposure law" was repealed 20 years ago.<eos> The only reason the Canadians are going along with all of this is because it seems you have an advocate in their government.<eos> If you have any idea who... I'll send him a food basket.<eos> Yes Sir.<eos> One last thing.<eos> This now involves three countries. and you do not set policy for this government on your own, are we clear?<eos> We are.<eos> Oh God, I was just looking for you.
Come here!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Speak!<eos> What happened to your tooth?<eos> Are any of you hurt?<eos> Did you get hurt, brother?<eos> I'm just asking you. If you have anything to say, talk to me.<eos> They're just peasants who don't know any better.<eos> If they offended you in any way, I apologize.<eos> What brings you here?
Chief!<eos> - Jong-shik!<eos> - Don't do it, bro!<eos> - Out of my way!<eos> - Easy!<eos> Are you okay, sir?<eos> Get him!<eos> Suspect located.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> Who told you to shoot?
Liverpool instead. Gotta go.<eos> Thai movie?<eos> Nang-Pee-Pee-Pee<eos> Nang-Pee Nang-Pee, I have I have<eos> Here, here, here.<eos> Pee.<eos> No<eos> Here's they're Pee Pee<eos> They really are pee-pee<eos> This will also freak you out.
It seems like Hae Ra and you are destined to be together.<eos> Let's eat first.<eos> Hae Ra, let's eat something good.<eos> Yes, grandfather.<eos> Choose some too, Seung Jo.<eos> Yes.<eos> Seung Jo does not like to eat oily food.<eos> - Set B should be better and the quantity is just right too.<eos> - I will choose that then.<eos> The both of you are already behaving like a married couple within such a short time, agreeing with each other.
Now go, young challengers!<eos> Master, I heard you used to change your age and appearance as you travelled around.<eos> As a young kid... as a lovesick adolescent, and such.<eos> Wow... I'm interested to know what you looked like in your youth, Lady Tsunade.<eos> Oh, me too!<eos> Hmm...<eos> Very well then!<eos> Well?<eos> Pretty charming, don't you think? Huh?<eos> Wh-What's with you two?
Everyone should accompany me.<eos> Come on, Buzz.<eos> Our mission is completed with Andy.<eos> What?<eos> - We must stay together.<eos> Without Andy, we were not together.<eos> Look at your shoe, you too Jessie, what name is on it?<eos> Perhaps Andy does not care about us.<eos> - Of course. To us all.<eos> I saw that he wanted to put you in the attic.
Succeeded.<eos> - All right, Slink.<eos> Climb over it.<eos> Are you lost, little dog?<eos> Look who's back.<eos> I'm sorry, cowboy.<eos> They have broken me.<eos> What do you all?<eos> Back to your child at the races?<eos> He wants you anymore.
Or do we call you Boots these days?<eos> Here, you two ladies on a date or something?<eos> Who the fuck are you calling a girl?<eos> - All right, sweetheart.<eos> - Oh, bollocks.<eos> All right, Dunn, leave it out, will you?<eos> There's nothing going on here that'll interest you.<eos> Unless of course you want to plant something.<eos> You insult my integrity, Boots.<eos> I thought I'd just stop to say hello, let you know I'm still looking out for you.
Dad, I'm busy, okay?<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> Dad?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> Okay fine!<eos> Dad, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Dad, what's wrong?<eos> Just tell your sister I love you both, okay?
Wheels within wheels.<eos> And it is time for your cog to turn.<eos> The postmaster has the use of a small apartment.<eos> And I believe there is a hat, too. Mmm.<eos> 'There was nothing for it but to deploy Rule 13- when captured, turn enemies into friends.'<eos> Can we talk frankly, Mr Pump?<eos> A golem is incapable of lying. Really?<eos> How unfortunate for you.<eos> Fact is, I'm worried.<eos> Lord Vetinari works you so hard.
And it was just lying around?<eos> That's hard to believe, isn't it?<eos> It's a collector's piece.<eos> But it's yours now, Stanley.<eos> Really, Mr Lipwig?<eos> I have got a place ready and waiting for it.<eos> I'm sorry I broke the regulations, senior postman Groat.<eos> That's all very well, sir, but...<eos> Did you say "senior postman", sir?<eos> I'm in charge, which means I can promote you, yes?
I'm afraid no one knows where Ben is, which is why I'm here.<eos> Clive.<eos> Well, boys and girls, let's repair to the tavern!<eos> Good night, sweet prince.<eos> I seem to recall, miss conliffe... I seem to recall he mentioned you in one of his letters.<eos> And it's quite uncharacteristic of my brother to treat a lady in such a way, but the character of man is such a shiftable thing.<eos> You misapprehend me.<eos> Benjamin is missing from blackmoor.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Did my father send you?
Sorry, colonel.<eos> I meant to shoot you.<eos> Sadly, I'm not the marksman I used to be.<eos> I must be getting old.<eos> He's cursed.<eos> God has forsaken him.<eos> Let us deal with him.<eos> You know you're trespassing on my land, and i could shoot you on the spot right now.<eos> My sikh manservant, he's on the roof, and he happens to be a crack shot with a repeating rifle.<eos> And he will kill you.
Just stay here with me.<eos> Stay here with me!<eos> Miss conliffe, good morning.<eos> Inspector.<eos> May I impose?<eos> I must ask you directly, have you seen Lawrence Talbot?<eos> I'm sure by now you've heard of his escape.<eos> Yes, I've heard.<eos> And, no, I haven't seen him.<eos> Miss conliffe, I cannot stress to you enough the mortal peril you're in should you find yourself in his presence.
- No, wait for it.<eos> Book a band, blow up balloons, people pay out the ass for that, don't they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, they do.<eos> I'm not wearing any underwear.<eos> Hey, Molly. Molly.<eos> Check it out.<eos> So Deb and I are gettin' hitched.<eos> How much cash do you pocket for a wedding?<eos> Any of this striking you as inappropriate?
I know you and these asses like to do whatever you want down Rodeo drive, but here, I'm the producer<eos> I'm the boss There'll be no party, no drugs, and no sex!<eos> Do you think you can put that no sex clause in Jerry's contract?<eos> There's no respect, I'm the driver, the production assistant, I'm the fucking caterer the fucking- Fuck, fuck, baby.<eos> We're full time party girls, Val. Okay?<eos> It's what we do.<eos> And it's like, you don't want us doing what we do.<eos> Yeah, like making me wear panties to the Saturn A wards, or not letting Rome shave her head.<eos> Girls, girls, it's not about wearing panties or shaving your puss - Head,<eos> It's about not letting these parasitic boyfriends drag you down.
You return to Nottingham?<eos> I have a wife who waits for me.<eos> I have a mother that won't die, and a brother who wishes me dead.<eos> First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.<eos> Your people will rejoice to see you return home.<eos> And that is a condition I would like to keep them in.<eos> To be remembered as I was.<eos> My army knows better.<eos> Lion Heart is mangy.<eos> Every man in that army idolizes you, Your Majesty.
No Sir.<eos> Are you here about the tax?<eos> No, I'm here to bring him his sword.<eos> His son's dead.<eos> This way.<eos> He'll take your horse.<eos> Marion!<eos> Marion!<eos> Maggie, where is she?<eos> Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.
Ooh. Yeah, until my wife found out.<eos> Would your wife go this far to get back at you for cheating on her?<eos> No, she divorced me and moved to Arizona.<eos> I think that's far enough.<eos> Plus, she has no way of getting us all here together.<eos> And she has no reason to. I pay my alimony.<eos> I don't think she hates me that much.<eos> No ex-wife would want her man dead.<eos> That's her money train.<eos> Look, no one knows you two, so I doubt it's the ex-wife.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Sorry, I'm late. Hi, honey.<eos> A little emergency at the hospital.<eos> Kevin was showing us his magnificent estate.<eos> It's really nice.<eos> So this is where you rough it when you're not at the homeless shelter?<eos> Kind of split time between the two. Maybe 60/40 here.<eos> - Really? - Now that Greg's finally arrived, why don't I take you over to see the meadow?
Gimme that.<eos> You tell him one thing...<eos> - (t(enny) Get back here. you fucka<eos> - The ricochets. t(enny. fucka<eos> - You nearly fuckin' killed mea<eos> - Darren...<eos> Mind me valuables. yeah?<eos> - Sorry. Darren.<eos> - You sapa<eos> What did I tell you?
Everyone, eat as much as you like!<eos> Ah, I'm full.<eos> I can't eat another bite.<eos> Not only was it incredibly good, but it was so cheap, too.<eos> That was delicious.<eos> You are truly skilled.<eos> Of course!<eos> How skilled!<eos> Wonderful!<eos> Ah, thank you for the meal.
That's accurate.<eos> Yes, but that is not just.<eos> I was unaware to be examined on the mathematics.<eos> Well, you can't do physics without mathematics, really, can you?<eos> If I receive the failing grade, I Lose my scholarship, and I feel shame.<eos> I understand the physics.<eos> I understand the dead cat.<eos> But you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math.<eos> The math tells how it really works. That's the real thing.<eos> The stories I give you in class are just illustrative.
I have here a letter from... Chance's platoon commander.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I also have here some of Chance's things.<eos> It's still set on Baghdad time.<eos> Here.<eos> This is the medal that grandma gave him.<eos> Remember?<eos> I want you to know you do not mourn alone today.<eos> All across America, from Virginia to Delaware, Pennsylvania, Minnesota,<eos> Montana, Wyoming, people are thinking of you and praying for you.
No.<eos> There I was again, keeping secrets, living a lie.<eos> Calm down. Fuck you!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Calm you fuckin' down.<eos> Stop it, calm down. I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> Like I said, I tend to do that.<eos> No, I didn't blame Phillip for running out on me. But I had to get him back.<eos> You see, there's something I didn't tell you.
- Let's see how superior you are when I kick your ass.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - You want some of that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Guys.<eos> - I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> - No, come on.<eos> No.<eos> This smug asshole insulted you, and I want him to take it back.
If you like, I can arrange for you to join her.<eos> Mother.<eos> How long did you think I would tolerate your insolence?<eos> Burn her.<eos> Drink it.<eos> You won't feel a thing.<eos> Are they booing me?<eos> How dare they.<eos> They love you.<eos> They're wooing you.
We have access to any photograph on any server, anywhere in the world.<eos> Yep. Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time.<eos> Football game, ATM machine, airport...<eos> We'll find her, and then we'll find out who sent her.<eos> From NATO, sir.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What happened to her?<eos> Well, it appears that I've been made official custodian of the warheads.<eos> Looks like your mission is complete here, Duke.<eos> When you move them, she's gonna come after you.

Fear is a great motivator.<eos> I have a target in mind, one the French will never forget, as I've never forgotten what they did to Clan McCullen.<eos> Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?<eos> Born ready, Doctor.<eos> This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime.<eos> Yes, as a master of disguise, you have no equal, my friend.<eos> Eighteen months of studying my target, learning mannerisms, but the devil is in the details.<eos> Gentlemen, let's get it going.<eos> One more thing.<eos> I'll control my own brain, thank you very much.
Yet the forces of evil could not prevail our calmness of...<eos> There. The story stopped.<eos> No more story.<eos> But we're still here.<eos> The fire's still burning.<eos> It's still snowing.<eos> The wind's still blowing.<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> Come on, cheer up, Doc.<eos> I've freed you from all this ridiculous nonsense.
A government program.<eos> And it is going to blow up in their face.<eos> I need you, Mohinder.<eos> I need your brain. I need your strength.<eos> Together, we can help people.<eos> We can save lives.<eos> What do you say?<eos> He came to you.<eos> What?<eos> I just saw you and him in a cab.
Just wanted to say congrats.<eos> You guys have really been on a roll lately.<eos> Thank you,sir.<eos> This man is not donner.<eos> He's sylar.He has shape-shifting abilities.<eos> Get a lock on the back of his head. Whoa,whoa,guys.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Tell 'em,danko.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Agent danko has betrayed you. He and sylar are working against you.
You're right, it tastes like shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the schedule for the overseas trip.<eos> Let me see.<eos> What did he just say?<eos> He asked when we were supposed to sleep.<eos> - As well as other basic human functions.<eos> - Hey.<eos> If Madiba can do it, we can do it.<eos> In a common struggle that has brought about our emancipation and pushed back the frontier of racism the millions of our people say thank you and thank you again.
SKIP: She has a beautiful mind.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> SKIP: You do, honey.<eos> ...in San Diego five years ago.<eos> - We've both been obsessed... SKIP: Obsessed.<eos> ...with Barbie and Ken since we were little kids.<eos> And we just wanna take one more step to becoming more like them.<eos> - It's evolution.<eos> - That's all.<eos> So, what if the two of you split up?
Live it up, folks!<eos> You'll be a long time dead!<eos> Don't let the worms have all the fun.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> A merry Christmas to you.<eos> - And to you, sir.<eos> - Happy holiday!<eos> And a merry Christmas to you.<eos> - "God bless you, sir."
And will you have the goodness...<eos> Lord bless me!<eos> - My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?<eos> - And not a farthing less.<eos> A great many back payments are included in it, I assure you.<eos> My dear sir, I don't know what to say to such...<eos> Do not say anything.<eos> I'm much obliged to you.<eos> Many thanks to you.<eos> And bless you.
- Too late.<eos> We have to run!<eos> - Wait.<eos> I was wondering what your town's policy is regarding firearms.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> There's a lot of guns coming in right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think he's over here.<eos> Can I help you boys out?
Little loft in Soho.<eos> The math adds up, Mike.<eos> She's his daughter.<eos> All right.<eos> Give her a call, tell her I'll help her out.<eos> But tell Melanie she has to stop spying.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> To make a magnet powerful enough to wipe a security camera tape, you need a strong power supply.<eos> A wall outlet will do nicely if there's one available, but if you need something more portable, a car battery works in a pinch.<eos> Of course, you have to be careful to use a heavy-gauge wire if you don't want a fiery explosion that covers you in battery acid.
Mercedes and Portia.<eos> Mercedes and Portia.<eos> Ah, yes, cousin Mercedes.<eos> Send them up, por favor.<eos> You said you were his cousins?<eos> Yeah, distant cousins, removed a couple times.<eos> Are you gonna let us go up or what, baby?<eos> Okay, go see your cousin.<eos> I'm gonna regret that.<eos> Sorry, didn't see you there.
It doesn't look good.<eos> Henry is not the help, Mother.<eos> He's a human being.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> He's a human being.<eos> But sweetheart, a doorman?<eos> Why on earth would you date a doorman?<eos> How do you think that makes me feel?<eos> Meredith Dowling's daughter is going out with their doorman.<eos> I just hope no one saw you together.
Seriously, if you say anything she's just gonna spaz out. Gets packed up by tonight.<eos> It's fine with me.<eos> If it's okay with you? Right?<eos> Yeah! .<eos> I mean... but...<eos> What do you think? We should... you know see what we got before we say anything.<eos> I know what you've got.<eos> You've got a gateway to hell underneath your house.<eos> And that is really cool.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Slowly.<eos> Kick it.<eos> Drag him under the truck. Now!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hands up.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> You're going to take me down to the fuel tanks. Let's go.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The president will see you now.
I already told you,she can't be spared right now. I only need a short time with her.<eos> - You can't have her.<eos> - Are you going to force me<eos> - to get the A.G. on the line?<eos> - You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You really want to press this right now? We're in the middle of an international crisis.<eos> - I'm aware of that.<eos> - And all you seem interested in is condemning the actions of an agent who's in God-knows-what danger just so you can nail her - to the wall.<eos> - If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines and used illegal tactics to get information, - then,yes,she will be prosecuted.<eos> - Then maybe you can let us get her back first before you throw her to the wolves,I mean,if that's okay with you.
Now, if someone went and made a beer run, I think we'd have everything we need for a goddamn kickass party.<eos> DJ!<eos> Play We Are Family by Sister Sledge!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Finally!<eos> Somebody hit the nail on the head.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> That is a perfect song.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I warned you over and over again not to tell me how to do my job.
A job?<eos> God put you on this Earth for one thing and one thing only.<eos> You conduct those people off the train up to the platform. You got that? Let me hear it.<eos> Let me hear you do that.<eos> Listen up, everybody.<eos> We're gonna go back to the platform. I need everybody to-- Regina.<eos> Let's do it again. Conduct those people.<eos> Listen. Now, we're gonna head back towards the platform.<eos> I want everybody to slowly get up.<eos> -I'm gonna get you off this train.
This way?<eos> This way! This way!<eos> I'll just get the bags.<eos> What happened to your finger?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sorry, fellas.<eos> Cheers, mate.<eos> Welcome to Timor.<eos> Cheers, Mal.<eos> So, Channel 7 beat you to it.
- Please, listen...<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> You gotta listen to me, Casper.<eos> Listen, my ass, that's my cousin, Jack.<eos> Why don't you just start from the beginning, Jack?<eos> So this must be where they keep all the beautiful girls hidden.<eos> Arrested?<eos> He didn't do it, it's one of those...<eos> wrong place, wrong time kinda things.<eos> Guess the Mexicans beat you to the punch.
And believe me, you. I have been through some... .. some pretty heavy stuff.<eos> We lost 8.. precious students... .. including, Ahmet, from India.<eos> Several parents, and our beloved Spanish teacher,<eos> .. Ms. Erickson.<eos> - No way!<eos> Erickson ate shit?<eos> Now more than ever, besides your teenage concerns about... .. who's the cool dude, or who's a hole.<eos> We can't let that damn fire win.<eos> They already won.<eos> God bless you, kids.
God damn it!<eos> What is your fucking agenda here?<eos> You people don't understand a fucking thing about how the world really works.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I understand subjectively.<eos> That's fucking nonsense.<eos> Your sick minds have been polluted with crap.<eos> Your music, movies, science.<eos> Fucking bohemians on hallucinogenic drugs.<eos> All that shit has poisoned you.
Why don't you get your hand up?<eos> What are you,nuts?<eos> I'm not ready to be a sponsor.<eos> Well,you got some time clean.I mean,come on.<eos> You're solid.<eos> It might do you some good to think about somebody else other than yourself for a change.<eos> Get your hand up.<eos> Well... I'm already thinking about her.<eos> Look around.<eos> See if you see someone that you might want to sponsor you.
Yeah,I got a couple.<eos> You know,build it on the edge of a cliff, and go inside and start fixing it up,and then pay somebody to come along and just push it over the side.<eos> Save you a lot of time and money.<eos> Yeah,well,that actually is not gonna work,'cause we're opening it in the city.<eos> I love it.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> That shit ain't funny anymore.<eos> Pretty funny.<eos> Come on,you guys,huh?<eos> I told you to cut out this shit with the cherry bombs before you set this joint on fire.
Somebody better start talking to me!<eos> Just a little misunderstanding, chief, that got out of hand.Ok?<eos> You know you got a guy talking shit about 9/11 over here?<eos> See what happens?<eos> My guys, in the kitchen now!<eos> And the rest of you-- come on, get in the kitchen.<eos> What's the matter with you guys?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yeah, I'll be in the kitchen.<eos> The rest of you, I see you within 10 feet of this place, I make one phone call, I get you busted back to probie school.You understand me?
Katherine, katie, ha.<eos> Your ears must have been burning.<eos> We heard all about your loft and about the weekend place in montauk.<eos> Oh, montauk is wonderful.<eos> We talked about getting a place there, but it's a little remote.<eos> But the people are normal, not like those hampton types.<eos> By that I mean jews.<eos> I can say that.<eos> We're jewish.<eos> Oh! And they let you into connecticut?
It's a nice piece of land, but still... if I add up everything you owe me,<eos> I should, first of all, seize the plantation, and second, kick you out.<eos> And you'd still owe me and the government.<eos> Enough.<eos> Get your father's signature.<eos> Have your Fanta.<eos> This is my Fanta.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Those are my men.<eos> They can take you to the border.
I wanted to get her to back off for you.<eos> Imagine my surprise when i picked it up and there was a man on the line.<eos> It's probably the new guy she's seeing.<eos> Some real estate douche bag.<eos> Keeps threatening me about pam's alimony.<eos> I spoke to pam.<eos> She's not seeing anyone.<eos> She told me she was.<eos> Stop lying.<eos> Pam said she hadn't spoken to you in months.
Face it you're ugly.<eos> I am not ugly.<eos> Well, okay, let me help you out here.<eos> You might as well face the fact that you're gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never gonna get.<eos> - How can you possibly-?<eos> - Hey, Lassie.<eos> The show's called The Ugly Truth.<eos> If you can't face it, don't call.<eos> That wraps it up for this evening.<eos> I'm Mike Chadway reminding you that the truth is never pretty.
I am the messenger of Omar Boulounga.<eos> Go ahead, make me an offer.<eos> Do not put the cart before the horse.<eos> It will save us from having 2 feet in the same hoof.<eos> If you have the eye of Mussolini I'll give you the molar of Marilyn.<eos> It's worth it.<eos> I've got the finger of Matisse and fingernails Churchill name the price.<eos> What say you, Mr. Lazarus?<eos> Mr. Lazarus has had a setback, he had to leave.<eos> Unfortunately, Mr. Lazarus had to stand you up.
All right then.<eos> Go to bed now, all of you.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Your mother and I will sleep poorly: I have to beat you and the strokes will cause us more pain than you.<eos> Leave us alone, and go to bed!<eos> When you were little, your mother sometimes tied a ribbon in your hair or around your arm.<eos> Its white color was to remind you of innocence and purity.<eos> I thought you were now well-mannered enough to get by without such reminders.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Tomorrow, once your punishment has purified you, your mother will re-tie a ribbon on you, and you'll wear it until we can trust you again.
I think so!<eos> Baum, you drive around the woods.<eos> You flank him!<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Come on, Red, come on.<eos> Come on. We're getting out of here.<eos> Hey, give me the keys to that car.<eos> Have you...<eos> All you bastards wear vests, so I'm gonna give it to you high and I'm gonna give it to you low.
I have a wife and kids, you see!<eos> Hang in there!<eos> This man is named Hanbei.<eos> Masanobu,<eos> Shinpachi, it must hurt a lot.<eos> But... my Ichijiro suffered far more.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> My Ichijiro...<eos> Lord... for Ichijiro's life a thousand heads, or ten thousand heads, would not be enough.<eos> I would like to see with you, my lord, the head of the one who is responsible.
Detain Dr. Stoval and the informant if he appears.<eos> Anthony is transforming.<eos> Destroy him and his wife as well, if that becomes necessary.<eos> - Where is Anthony?<eos> Anthony! Show yourself. Show yourself, or your wife dies, just like your son.<eos> Coward.<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> Your son is murdered, your wife tortured, and you do nothing.<eos> Yuriko, you should have married a real man.<eos> - So Anthony wouldn't kill any of you?
Let me see if I get this right.<eos> Hazlit left flowers by his kills.<eos> Now,if frank dunlop's body had had flowers surrounding it, - that woulda been a copycat,yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But frank dunlop's body the way it was found?<eos> It was a flower that someone left for hazlit,and that's a tribute.<eos> Yes,detective.<eos> That's a tribute.<eos> okay,hazlit didn't like people who lied or broke promises to him.<eos> Frank dunlop ever break any promises to you?
You like clifton?<eos> 'Cause he's not from your world.<eos> He's not your dad over there.<eos> He drives for people like your dad.<eos> Mindy,are you recanting because you really weren't with clifton?<eos> Or is it because it turns out the man you were with is a hazlit?<eos> I wasn't with clifton.<eos> You're looking at obstruction of justice.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> My father said his lawyers will call you about that.
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.<eos> Let Bishop Cyril speak in his own defense.<eos> Prefect our blessed parabolani,<eos> Whom he has just called the Beast of Burden. Devote themselves true enough to carrying burdens.<eos> crippled, the sick, the lepers...<eos> And stones!<eos> Prefect, they carry stones.<eos> And now, they burst into the theatre and stone us knowing we will do nothing to defend ourselves. Because it is the Sabbath!<eos> On the Sabbath you should honor God in your synagogues instead stuffing yourselves with sweet set of theater.<eos> That is why the stones fell upon you.
I would like you to take me to the prefect immediately.<eos> Lady, he himself gave the order for you to be confined to the house until further notice.<eos> At the moment your presence on the streets is not advisable.<eos> For what reason?<eos> Cyril has made some serious accusations against you.<eos> And um... What does he accused me of?<eos> Ungodliness...<eos> And witchcraft.<eos> I see.<eos> Is something bothering you, Lady?
That's what mindless cramming does to you<eos> Cramming may see you through four years of college but it will 'screw' you for the next 40 years<eos> He still doesn't get it<eos> 'Medium fart is tolerable'...<eos> Unbelievable !<eos> You're a poet, Rancho.. How did you think of this?<eos> That was fun.<eos> He didn't know what hit him<eos> You swines!<eos> What did I ever do to you?
He's speaking to me.<eos> He's in a dark place. It's hard to understand him.<eos> He sounds a little like Yakov Smirnoff.<eos> He also has some Ritz Bits in his mouth.<eos> Cheese, no. Peanut butter. Shawn.<eos> Okay, I'll tell 'em.<eos> I said I'd tell them.<eos> All right, Vlad says he knows it's an accident.<eos> Oh, I'm seeing through Vlad's eyes now.<eos> He invited you to go ATV-ing down by the lake. You were drinking.
Hello.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> My name is Shawn Spencer, I'm with the Big Uncles of America program.<eos> This is my underprivileged mentee, Hollaback Atcha.<eos> He's selling magazine subscriptions as a way to learn business skills.<eos> Otherwise, he'd be forced to join a gang if he was still on the streets.<eos> If I were still out on the street, I'd be an OG.<eos> You wish.<eos> Okay, just don't tell anyone I let you in.
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you from Delhi.<eos> Thank you, my friend.<eos> And good luck.<eos> Ajit.<eos> We are going on a big ship. - That was so cool. - Yeah, that was intense.<eos> - Those helicopters were so cool.<eos> - Wait. Wait. Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Sorry. One question:<eos> What did the government guys say to you?
- Camps?<eos> - Hang on a minute.<eos> Why haven't you guys done this already?<eos> There was food here.<eos> It was warm and dry.<eos> We've been running for weeks.<eos> Frankly, we needed a rest.<eos> Okay, so, what happens if the generator fails before we reach the sublevel?<eos> Then the security door won't open and we'll be trapped.<eos> Dorothy and I were heading that way when we met you.
Porter house steak, seared, medium rare.<eos> Napkin, Nick.<eos> - Napkin.<eos> Oh, excuse me, waiter You might wanna put 30% down for yourself, my man<eos> What time is it?<eos> - 1 o'clock.<eos> Is that right, Nick?<eos> - It's 1:08.<eos> Well that's dissapointing, Warden.<eos> How can you expect me not to fuck with you when you cant even be honest with me
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.<eos> 5.<eos> Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have a yeast infection, and an unbelievable set of tits.<eos> For our last exercise, I am going to demonstrate what I call, "Ocean of anger. "<eos> Hold on, because we are about to go deep.<eos> All of us as women have developed a reservoir of resentment and anger.<eos> And these reservoirs put together form an ocean, and this ocean is available for all us to draw from.<eos> It holds the collective power of every women, who has ever been wronged in an inappropriate sexual remark being underpaid for a job you've done better than a man, ancestor who was a slave.<eos> Or rice picker, or simply lowman on the totem pole.<eos> A husband who has wronged you, who has cheated and lied to you, or you, or you, or you.
Do, are you sick?<eos> Are you going to die?<eos> Do, if you die, I will go with you<eos> May the light show you the way.<eos> And may we meet again.<eos> Hey, slow down!<eos> Get up.<eos> I want to see you in the church, each one of you saying the rosary and reformed.
You found it really fast.<eos> What are you...<eos> Oh... (muffled screaming) I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I'm-I'm really sorry.<eos> Leo:<eos> Caroline:<eos> What do they need babies for?<eos> This is Rossum.<eos> They don't care about souls. Human or animal.<eos> What are they doing to you?
What are you talking about?<eos> He didn't understand the bond between Confessor and Seeker.<eos> And he betrayed me.<eos> Kieran, Vivian must leave us.<eos> Why?<eos> There is too much between you. I see it in oyur eyes.<eos> - You love her.<eos> - We've done nothing wrong.<eos> Yet.<eos> I have watched the two of you growing closer.
People of Hartland, let us pray.<eos> Master Rahl, guide us.<eos> Master Rahl, teach us.<eos> Master Rahl, protect us.<eos> In your light we thrive.<eos> In your mercy we are sheltered.<eos> In your wisdom we are humbled.<eos> Seek cover!<eos> Protect yourselves!<eos> Brave soldiers, all of Hartland thanks you and honors you for your courage!
You should talk, you bloated bag of swill.<eos> Warms my heart to hear you lovebirds coo.<eos> Lovebirds my posterior.<eos> If you hadn't found that mirror and brought us into the current business, that one would be a distant memory of wasted youth by now.<eos> Soon enough, my dove.<eos> Just a few more bags of gold salted away, and I will never again have to look into your shining eyes and ask myself, - "What was I thinking?"<eos> - Meant for each other, aren't you? Like two fleas on a dog's pos...<eos> What?<eos> Richard, Kahlan! I'm so glad to see you both alive and well.<eos> What brings you back here so soon?
Fine, Gwildor's all yours.<eos> You're not scared of Gwildor. You're just not ready to give up those rippling muscles.<eos> A story to tell with pride, boys:<eos> the day you saw the Seeker and the Confessor die in agony.<eos> You wanna story to tell with pride?<eos> Promise you'll let us go on our way, and the Seeker here will be more than happy to finish what I was so rude to interrupt.<eos> What?<eos> Show no mercy.<eos> Richard, Kahlan!<eos> Thank all the Spirits in Creation I found you in time.
Power is only valuable if it can be harnessed.<eos> If not, then it's no power at all.<eos> That sounded just like a Calthrop.<eos> I haven't cast the spell yet.<eos> Another monster?<eos> Zedd's on his way to Agaden Reach to find out who Shota cursed.<eos> And what do we do when we find this person?<eos> We prevent them from hurting innocent people.<eos> My Queen, shall I inform Prince Marius?<eos> Is there something else bothering you, Your Majesty?
That's all I ask.<eos> If I don't come back by then...<eos> May the Spirits protect you, child.<eos> Mistress Denna, would you allow Constance to train me tomorrow?<eos> Why are you asking for Constance?<eos> You prefer her touch to mine?<eos> Obviously I've been too easy on you!<eos> Why do you ask for her?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Because it hurts you to use the Agiel.
Sasha is a whore.<eos> She's selling herself.<eos> If I got it right, she's that Slovenian Girl... the famous Slovenian Girl.<eos> This is the woman for whom I divorced my wife... a whore.<eos> I can't believe I was such an idiot.<eos> Vesna, are you a whore too?<eos> What?<eos> The two of you work together?<eos> Study well, girls.<eos> I'm not going to bother you anymore.
Yes?<eos> It's for Edoardo Recchi.<eos> - Can I take it?<eos> - I'd prefer to deliver it myself.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Antonio BiscagIia.<eos> One moment.<eos> This way.<eos> follow the path.<eos> It'II take you to the entrance of the villa.
It's over, Brian.<eos> It's over, mate.<eos> They're never gonna take us back.<eos> Not now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sign today, and I'll give you a bonus of 7 grand.<eos> Each.<eos> 7 grand?<eos> You hear that, Brian?<eos> Plus, a salary that exceeds by 20% what Derby were paying you.
Because I really don't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma<eos> - the whole time we plan the wedding.<eos> - God, no.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not worth it to me.<eos> He's fine.<eos> Okay!<eos> We are back in business!<eos> Oh, honey!<eos> Don't you just love it when a song raises you up, makes you think you can do anything when all you have to do is hear it and you're motivated, you're inspired,
- Yeah, funny.<eos> We are so going to destroy those Chipmunks.<eos> - I don't wanna destroy them.<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> I just wanna hang out with them.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Hold... All right, look.<eos> You know, if you feel that way, maybe we should just withdraw from the contest.<eos> - What?<eos> - Then I'll put you in a FedEx package and mail you back to whatever tree you came from.
Don't worry, Simon.<eos> Alvin will walk through that door any minute now.<eos> Alvin!<eos> I am back!<eos> - Girls, that's for us.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> And now, let's hear it for a group that will rock you like a hurricane.
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.<eos> - Church.<eos> So you point it how you want, okay?<eos> Quarter, half, teener, whatever.<eos> But I make what I make. Two large.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Short me, you're out.<eos> Cut it, you're out.<eos> Period.<eos> This is a big opportunity I am giving you.
Any reason that he'd want to stockpile a whole bunch of Globibinum?<eos> Globidium. Don't push me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um... He usually kept to himself.<eos> I know he liked to clean, and I think he had a pet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bismark, you want to keep Area 51 here until further notice.<eos> Fargo, get your guys to G.D., just in case.<eos> You mean, like, in case we melt?<eos> Well, as long as you guys are green, I'd like someone to keep an eye on you.
This is my church.<eos> With this dram, right now, I nail my soul to the Devil's altar.<eos> You'll never meet a more eloquent philosopher of pure folly.<eos> Come on, Dorian.<eos> It's time we showed you what we've made.<eos> - Really?<eos> - The boy hasn't finished his gin.<eos> Go and fiddle with your background.<eos> We'll be along shortly.<eos> BASIL: Your picture awaits you, Dorian.
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy.<eos> Oh, woe is me.<eos> MANAGER:<eos> May I present the Theatre Royale's Miss Sibyl Vane, my lord?<eos> I'm not really a lord.<eos> I don't know why he keeps saying that.<eos> We don't get many gentlemen in this theatre.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, then, I shall recommend it to them.<eos> May I ask what brings you to my dressing room?
Come.<eos> Come upstairs.<eos> Forbid yourself nothing.<eos> Come.<eos> - Nobody at all need know.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> The pleasure is all mine.<eos> - I've heard so much about you.<eos> - And I you. Did you enjoy the show?<eos> I couldn't see you in the audience.
She can't...<eos> I wanted you to know... she loved you.<eos> She was going to have your child.<eos> And you killed her.<eos> Jim!<eos> Jim!<eos> Get up!<eos> Are you all right, sir?<eos> Let me...<eos> - help you up.
Except one.<eos> And if I could change that too I would do so.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is an agreement that Mr Heathcliff has first option to purchase any more land and buildings you may wish to sell.<eos> This is the balance of the account, sir.<eos> Joseph!<eos> Saddle up Hunter.<eos> Had I known I could ruin the man in the space of three months, I would have come back sooner.<eos> I thought I would never find this place.<eos> That's why I told you to bring Cathy's horse.
Saddle up Hunter.<eos> Had I known I could ruin the man in the space of three months, I would have come back sooner.<eos> I thought I would never find this place.<eos> That's why I told you to bring Cathy's horse.<eos> She could find her way up here in the dark.<eos> Is this the place where you bring all your sweethearts?<eos> Only Cathy before you.<eos> And is that how it is always going to be?<eos> Cathy before me?<eos> I saw a spirit in you last time I saw you at the Grange, Isabella, that has stayed with me.
She is bewitched!<eos> Hereafter she is only my sister in name, not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.<eos> And who shall tell the mistress of this turn of events?<eos> No-one.<eos> Since Isabella is no longer a member of her family, she needn't be troubled by news of her.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - You are deceiving me!<eos> - Shush, mistress.<eos> I promised the Master I would not tell you.<eos> I thought it might help you to accept your new life
I cannot live without my soul.<eos> Being married will will not be such a bad thing, will it, Catherine?<eos> I'm going to see my father.<eos> This locket was your mother's.<eos> I hope you'll be a dutiful daughter.<eos> I defy you to frighten me!<eos> Have you heard how your wife speaks to me, Linton?<eos> If you cannot take her in hand perhaps I'll have to do so myself.<eos> Linton loves me and for that reason I love him.<eos> Mr Heathcliff, you have nobody to love you and however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty rises from your greater misery!
Don't forget to give them the best oats you can find.<eos> Monaka, Orlika, Buyana.<eos> Bulba was horribly stubborn.<eos> He was one of those characters... who could only be found in the depths on the sixteenth century, and who, being born Cossacks, were provided with the reckless and savage mores of the Russian nature.<eos> He was a phenomenal example of Russian force, driven from the entrails of the people, as well as from many inequities.<eos> Here.<eos> Let's go !<eos> Let go !<eos> All right, let's go !<eos> My beloved sons, what's waiting for you ?
Keep at it, keep at it, keep at it.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, with your eyes closed, breathe in slowly.<eos> What's best? In through the nose and out through the mouth or in through the mouth and out through the nose?<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Breathe through your arse if you like. Just breathe.<eos> I get dizzy if I breathe too much.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Keep your eyes closed, breathe slowly and relax.<eos> Allow yourself to see yourself through the eyes of someone who loves you, totally loves you.

What is this?<eos> A bacteria.<eos> - A bacteria?<eos> Why would you... - Mark. We don't have much time.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've been helping Cassidy do?<eos> Computerized in-vitro gestational chambers.<eos> For women who can't give birth naturally.<eos> I wish that's what it was.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Cassidy has been using you.
They don't know what's really going on. They're not in charge here.<eos> What a fuckin' joke!<eos> Chief, this guy's a priest.<eos> A priest, Chief.<eos> - Sons of a bitch! - They tricked us!<eos> This is a secret operation. No one should know.<eos> You either.<eos> What are you going to do? What?<eos> Kill us after we're finished? What are you going to do,<eos> - you son of a bitch? - Be sure no one will believe you.
I will not fear the night terrors, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the plague that stalks the darkness,<eos> in the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit, tell me where you are.<eos> High above.<eos> Your blasphemy doesn't scare me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I told you, high above.<eos> Perhaps you're afraid, priest?<eos> In the penthouse.<eos> She's not there, there's nothing there.<eos> The light blinds you.
For my collection.<eos> This is really nice Mr. President.<eos> A gift.<eos> Sirs.<eos> Miss, excuse me.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I owe you a debt.<eos> All of France owes you a debt.<eos> Well, I don't blame you for not trusting a politician but I assure you that in the next 48 hours I will do what I can to unblock these present laws So that this sector can regain it's dignity and an important part in our society.
I do not like people.<eos> For a long I have not loved any one.<eos> No one?<eos> Not a soul.<eos> The peasants are all alike, they are stupid and live in dirt, and the educated people are hardt o get along with.<eos> One gets tired of them.<eos> All our good friends are petty and shallow and see no farther than their own noses, in one word, they are dull.<eos> Those that have brains are hysterical, devoured with a mania for self-analysis.<eos> They whine, they hate, they pick faults everywhere with unhealthy sharpness.<eos> They sneak up to you sideways, look at you out of the corner of their eye, and say :
Come in, Earth!<eos> Mr. Jordan.<eos> How is space?<eos> Great wink, Kenneth! Space is very cold, but very beautiful. And sometimes, it sounds like Jenna yelling in the distance.<eos> I think I...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Where did you get that rocket?<eos> Mr. Donaghy is letting me hold it!<eos> It's awesome!<eos> You know, I actually envy you two.
While I talk to your mom and dad?<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Yeah, go on. Go ahead.<eos> Before we do anything else, I'd like to... set some ground rules for ourselves and some goals.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> We don't want our divorce to upset him.<eos> It's already upsetting him, isn't it?<eos> He's confused, yeah, and when he's confused, he gets upset.<eos> You know, one of the things that I learned from talking to Oliver is that he doesn't actually know that you two are getting a divorce.<eos> Does that surprise you?
I've been perfectly clear with him.<eos> Luke is the one who never explains anything.<eos> He told Oliver that he was moving out while they were watching the Mets on TV.<eos> Bess.<eos> While they were watching {\a Mets game}the Mets, during a commercial{\ break}.<eos> He didn't give {\him }a chance to ask {\any }questions.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's...<eos> Let's not...<eos> Well, obviously the divorce is confusing and emotional for both of you, but you can imagine how overwhelming it is for Oliver.
Yeah.<eos> I didn't want to say nothing- I mean,I have a fiance- but Cynthia, she asked me out last week.<eos> She's kind of aggressive for a woman.<eos> I guess I kind of liked the attention.<eos> And this morning?<eos> It was down in the lobby.<eos> Come on.<eos> She found me and told me she couldn't wait to see me... and,uh,pulled me into the elevator.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That loser told you what?
Roy went to confront your father.<eos> A part of me... wanted him to... take me and my mother out of that house.<eos> All she put up with.<eos> Well... some people shouldn't stay together.<eos> Took me a long time to figure that out.<eos> Still my dad though, you know?<eos> Nice setup you got here, Glenn.<eos> Why don't you put the tools down and step away from the bench.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Did Diane let you in?
Now, look, I saw Your mom was gone.<eos> If you need Any company, I'm around, ok? I'm fine.<eos> Really.<eos> Really.<eos> Reid, we need to Figure out where That party was.<eos> Let's review one more time.<eos> I'm a serial killer Writing to my partner.<eos> Why do I keep A secret blog?<eos> It's a safe way to Relive your crimes.<eos> Uh, no one ever Sees you together, And, uh, no one Overhears you talking.
Prentiss,do you mind?<eos> I've got him.<eos> We can talk in here.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Hey,Danny,look,they're just right here.<eos> You see them?<eos> Ok.<eos> - Can I have a snack.<eos> - Yeah,sure.<eos> You didn't seem surprised when I told you that Bill had confessed.
Are we making new friends?<eos> I trust we're not forgetting our old ones.<eos> They all know that you've been lying to them.<eos> If part of your job was to help them, You might wanna remember how to do that.<eos> I think I help 'em.<eos> Who brings you news of your loved ones?<eos> Who tells your family what you want them to know,<eos> Not the true things, the bad thoughts, The secrets, the nasty things I know, but keep safe?<eos> You, doctor.<eos> And who really knows you deep down, But takes care of you anyway?
"Yeah, my parents got divorced a couple years back.<eos> "It was really tough.<eos> "LOL."<eos> And he clearly doesn't know what LOL means.<eos> Yeah, but here's the real problem.<eos> Ted wasn't saying "I love you" as easily as we thought he would.<eos> Then we met... Stan.<eos> Why are you making so much noise, man?<eos> So we explained everything to him, and when we were done, something amazing happened.<eos> Why don't you tell Ted that just knowing he's out there, thinking about you, caring about you, makes you feel safe?
I brought her an idea for a space-based telescope rig.<eos> I spent four years perfecting it.<eos> As soon as I left the project, they used it as a component in the Star Wars program.<eos> They weaponized my telescope.<eos> Nothing I could do about it...<eos> "Weaponized my telescope"?<eos> I hope that's not a Fleinhardt metaphor.<eos> We were just talking about you, funnily enough.<eos> Nice office.<eos> What brings you here?
The drug needs to be administered at 3-minute intervals.<eos> So she'll live in a hospital bed for years,you said.<eos> No,no,there's another way.<eos> There's a way she won't have to stay in the bed.<eos> - With a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension-- - ane girl needs a backpack.<eos> - No,no-- - a backpack-- it has a portable pump that will deliver her meds and allow her to play and go to school.<eos> She can have a childhood until she gets her new heart.<eos> This is something that we should have discussed privately earlier-- and she could leave the hospital?<eos> Yes,she can.See,she has to wear the backpack at all times.<eos> We will put you in a program,teach you how to administer the medications-- do you have a prettier one?
Why? Why--why would he page us stat?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did we kill anyone lately and don't remember?<eos> Your father's here.<eos> He's 29 days sober, just out of rehab.<eos> He's taking it seriously.<eos> He's working his steps.<eos> The ninth step is to make amends wherever possible.<eos> It's the key to an alcoholic's recovery-- to take responsibility for the wreckage of his past.<eos> I paged you here, to ask you to please hear him out.
And nobody is gonna take you away from your mom. Okay, Maddy?<eos> You hear me?<eos> It hit her in the face-- the gun, the kickback.<eos> 'Cause this doesn't look like-- that's how she got the cut.<eos> Her daddy shoots targets in the backyard.<eos> He put the gun down for a minute. It was stupid. It was really stupid.<eos> She never meant to hurt him.<eos> Okay, you'll tell the police that, and it'll--it'll be okay.<eos> Everything will be okay.<eos> I'm s- - I'm so deeply s-sorry... for every time that I ever hurt you or disappointed you or let you down.
- That's great, baby.<eos> - He's joking.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Turn around and look.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> -Joe? - Geez.<eos> None of this was on any of the maps until your fancy resort showed up.<eos> Gets better.<eos> The other end of that beach- - There's a cave.<eos> Leads you right back to your resort.
So, what do you think?<eos> We like that one better.<eos> Okay, I guess I'll just try it on.<eos> See? She loves it.<eos> That's all the proof you need.<eos> Now, it's not too late.<eos> Why don't you start making some phone calls?<eos> Right this way.<eos> Hi, it's Serena van der Woodsen.<eos> I know my mom might've called you this morning, but there's been a mistake.
She didn't tell you.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Do you remember that dvd she made for you last spring?<eos> Did you ever wonder how lana got her hands on a video camera right after she awoke from a deep coma?<eos> As long as i'm in your life, i'm holding you back.<eos> Please, for both of us, don't come looking for me.<eos> I love you, clark... more than you will ever know.<eos> Now let me go.<eos> It's for your own protection, ma'am.<eos> Is that what lex told you?
Explain what you think that is.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just explain that.<eos> As you sell more paper And your company grows, So will your costs.<eos> For example, delivery man, Health care. Well, we don't-- Business expansion.<eos> Whatever, yeah.<eos> So--<eos> At these prices, the more paper you sell The less money you'll make.<eos> Our prices are the only thing Keeping us in business.<eos> They're actually putting you out of business.
Is anybody still living here?<eos> It was previously attacked by the vampires.<eos> There won't be any vampires showing up now... will there?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> What are you going to do if you start being afraid now?<eos> What's that noise?<eos> Don't be scared guys.<eos> It's only an old woman.<eos> You go wandering around on the road so late at night.<eos> Monsters will come out to attack you.
If you're looking for something to help with your pain.<eos> It doesn't help my pain.<eos> It eliminates it.<eos> My leg doesn't hurt anymore.<eos> She completely disregarded our instructions.<eos> He asked a question.<eos> I was tired of lying.<eos> I didn't tell him anything about his genetic condition.<eos> I want her removed from our son's case.<eos> I'm sorry for the position Dr. Hadley put you in, but I can't do that.
Jessica.<eos> To Mummy.<eos> To Mummy.<eos> I think it's terrible that people have to come and die in a foreign country.<eos> Anne, can I just ask you one last question?<eos> Is there anything anyone could say to you this morning to make you change your mind?<eos> No, nothing at all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 'The procedure will take place in our organisation's apartment. '<eos> A trained volunteer will assist you.
Navigate.<eos> We're on highway 40.<eos> Where's the accident site?<eos> It says, uh, Kelbaker Road.<eos> Kel-baker?<eos> Kel-baker.<eos> Kelba-ker.<eos> Turn off the headlights!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I help you fellas?
I think I developed brain cells.<eos> Earthquake imminent.<eos> Volcanic eruption probable.<eos> Please evacuate the building.<eos> Hot tip, evacuate the building.<eos> Volcanic eruption is imminent.<eos> I´m feeling hot, hot, hot.<eos> The soup is cooking.<eos> I will try to stop the eruption.<eos> I hope the two of you realize the severity of the situation and say what you think to each other.
Several civilians followed them, but they lost the tracks up in the mountains.<eos> In these exact mountains...<eos> Where they most likely froze to death.<eos> Because of that people step lightly up here.<eos> There's an evil presence here.<eos> An evil you wouldn't want to wake.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We have to be careful so we don't wake up the evil.<eos> I should get moving.<eos> - Remember what I told you.
Don't...move.<eos> Is that everything?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stay on your knees.<eos> I really must go to the dungeon before your husband comes back.<eos> Yes, the Sheriff would be very upset.<eos> Yes, he would.<eos> He is the most powerful man in York.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> And if you're as fond of me as I am of you...
Go, go, go.<eos> - Hey, I know a sock.<eos> - That is a small...<eos> - Time is up.<eos> Thank God.<eos> - Good.<eos> - How we do?<eos> - Nine points, baby, baby.<eos> Wilson men, kicking ass and taking names.<eos> Why don't you let a real artiste show you how it's done?
Who did it start with?<eos> His mother.<eos> I'm Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the Christies.<eos> The fact that she's a loon, totally out of her mind and also channeling her son and going...<eos> Kill her, Mommy.<eos> Kill her!<eos> The idea for the character came out of my own past.<eos> Mrs. Voorhees is the mother I never had.<eos> She is the mother who will kill people to avenge her son's death.<eos> But, hey, if you're gonna have a mother defend you, she might as well be crazy.
This is the first time we saw him step out in the hockey mask.<eos> The birth of Jason.<eos> There's something to be said about putting a mask on and doing things that you wouldn't normally do with that mask off.<eos> Jason in "Part III" runs.<eos> That's the one where he runs.<eos> Got a little of that left over.<eos> After that he becomes the slow methodical stalker.<eos> If he sees you, he's not gonna stop.<eos> It's like a beacon.<eos> Once he's popped in on you, he's gonna stay there until he kills you.
"Friday the 13th," a movie that was made to keep filmmakers' lights on, but made America afraid to turn them off.<eos> And one that singlehandedly gave birth to modern slasher cinema, generating box office success beyond anybody's wildest dreams.<eos> You know, "Friday the 13th" continues to inspire and influence emerging filmmakers who try to capture their own lightning in a bottle.<eos> And on top of that, I can probably proclaim that Jason Voorhees is a pop-culture icon recognized the world over.<eos> So here we are.<eos> It's three decades later, and "Friday the 13th" lives on.<eos> And it's because of you that Jason Voorhees keeps coming back to terrify audiences.<eos> So let me return the favor.<eos> I'll give you some advice.<eos> If somebody invites you to Camp Crystal Lake, just don't go.
We'll be out soon.<eos> Will he get us out? Yeah.<eos> In here.<eos> He doesn't know Harkness is his grandfather?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose it would take some explaining.<eos> Why Mum looks older than Granddad.<eos> I can only assume that you're holding me here as insurance against my father.<eos> But let me warn you.<eos> If you've angered him, then God help you.
You don't need to tell me.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> If you let us in, we would've taken him out ourselves.<eos> You didn't stand a chance.<eos> You never did.<eos> - Hey, hey, come on.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> Get back.<eos> - You don't have to like it, but it's the truth.<eos> It took on your entire outfit and forced you to retreat.
Fair enough.<eos> Kids, let's practice.<eos> Mi, mi, mi, mi. Well that's a....<eos> - There's a day we'll never get back.<eos> - I was so bored.<eos> That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat.<eos> Not your diaphragm.<eos> I was so bored<eos> Look!<eos> A welcome mat that tells you you're weight.
Mr. Duman?<eos> Michael<eos> Mr. Duman, open the door!<eos> Mr. Duman are you OK?<eos> Open the door!<eos> Calm down.<eos> Keep screaming all the way back to Haiti, you're gonna be hoarse for your trial.<eos> I guess he can't change the past after all.<eos> You need to get going.<eos> Sam has a friend with a boat. He'll get you both back to Haiti.
Huddle up. Come on, come on.<eos> All right, now, listen. I've seen this team play, and they're all D, which is easy to get around if you look for the open shot.<eos> You guys seen Hoosiers?<eos> I want you to pass the ball four times before you shoot.<eos> What's the most beautiful, beautiful play in basketball?<eos> -Does anybody know? -Dribbling? -Scoring?<eos> -Passing.<eos> That's right, passing.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because it binds you together as a team, okay?
I love you too.<eos> I wanna stay with you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> What's happened?<eos> - We found her in the woods.<eos> - It's all gone wrong.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - I think she's stopped breathing.<eos> - She'll not stay that way.<eos> - You have the clutch I gave you?
You have our condolences. - And you mine.<eos> Well, I'm glad everybody...<eos> . Who the fuck was that guy?<eos> That, I suspect, was the shooter you boys have been looking for.<eos> Who the fuck is this broad?<eos> What the fuck is going on here?<eos> Let's speed this up before your new sidekick's gotta dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary.<eos> - Oh, no, you didn't! - Oh, yes I did.<eos> I am an FBI agent controlling this investigation from within in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell.<eos> Now, I am conspiring to do this with three like-minded individuals who have aided you in the past.
/Capo fucking regime!<eos> I want each one of you to call your top button man, the best that you have.<eos> 'Cause we are going to rip this city a new asshole.<eos> Starting tonight, we reconnoiter our strength on the streets.<eos> Starting now, we seize the day.<eos> /Law enforcement has classified /the Italian immigrant Ottilio Panza /as its prime suspect in the /murder of the beloved local cleric.<eos> /An all-points bulletin has been issued, /and it appears, at least for the time being, /the Saints have been cleared as /suspects in the priest's killing.<eos> Foolish, arrogant boy!<eos> Expanded my operations since I saw you last.<eos> Word got out who may or may not have outfitted you.
I've hit three out of five.<eos> Okay, wrap it up.<eos> Hardison's about to give his closing statement.<eos> Mr. Miller?<eos> You know, a week ago you were all strangers and then the same thing happened to all of you.<eos> You got that envelope, you know the one, comes in the mail, that says, "County of Los Angeles" on the top, you open it like this, "Oh, God," you know?<eos> A week passes, you watch the witnesses parade through. You listen to the lawyers argue.<eos> And suddenly you're not strangers anymore. Some of you have even made friends.<eos> It's not as bad as you thought, right?<eos> But then the judge asks you to deliberate and then you have a moment of doubt.
The king was carried from the fray<eos> As the army of Angmar made its way<eos> Our banner caught in a sea of death<eos> As the king's herald drew one last breath<eos> The banner toppled and fell to the Earth<eos> The enemy howled in terrible mirth<eos> As men ran in fear and cried<eos> The Lords Elladan and Elrohir of Rivendell arrived unlooked for, and wished to speak with us at once.<eos> Welcome, friends!<eos> What brings you to us this night?
And Zobelle has been working for the FBI all along.<eos> A rat?<eos> Trading senators and a.b. Shot-callers.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Get to Otto.<eos> Have him send word up the ranks. Gets us protected inside again, stops any aryan backlash once we drop Weston.<eos> - Weston's mine.<eos> - I know.<eos> Jax.<eos> My guys will escort you wherever you need to go.
- I'll have him back before lunch.<eos> I thought he just had all his tests.<eos> Ηe needs more.<eos> is something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> I'm Dr. Knowles.<eos> I'm his doctor.<eos> Wanna tell me what's going on here?<eos> I need to get both of them to the hospital.<eos> Maybe I should follow you.
Get...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Get off me.<eos> Put me down!<eos> All right, Mitchell, let him go.<eos> Do you have a name, child? Drew.<eos> Drew.<eos> Well, thanks to you, I've had to reset my alarm.<eos> What were you doing creeping around in my office?<eos> Answer me, child, or I'll attach you to Goldilocks here and set you both off screaming.
What do you think?<eos> Come on, one time for old time's sake.<eos> Are we in or is it all like dead and gone?<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on! Big John Brickner!<eos> Come on, John Brickner.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... Tonight... is a fight for the ages.<eos> A once in a lifetime brawl.<eos> For this, there are no rounds.<eos> And no bells to save you just what the Good Lord gave you.
No, no, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Really, I can't. I'm, you know...<eos> I'm a New Yorker. You know, I was born here.<eos> This is my home.<eos> I've had bagels in other parts of the country.<eos> I don't even like Connecticut.<eos> This man is a professional killer.<eos> He found you in one night, and he'll keep coming back.
Thanks, I appreciate that.<eos> And, I think... Yeah, I think he's funny.<eos> He makes me laugh.<eos> But if we're gonna stay together, then, you know, I guess we have to scale back our expectations, and I won't expect everything from him, and he won't expect everything from me and...<eos> You should expect everything from each other!<eos> Marriage doesn't make any sense!<eos> You gotta stop thinking about it, and just get over all the bullshit and make it work.<eos> Look, I figured if she said something, I was gonna...<eos> Oh, God. Come on, honey, let's just go.<eos> We'll pick you up and take you to the airport.
And saying goodbye to her... hurts us more than anything in this world.<eos> But it's time.<eos> I can't.<eos> She's ready to go...<eos> We gotta let her go.<eos> I love her so much.<eos> And I've always been so jealous of you.<eos> And I always wanted her to myself.<eos> Did you hate us?<eos> I never hated you.
If you spend all day with a gorgeous guy like me, he has to give me a hard time.<eos> What were you doing with your feet the other day?<eos> Reflexology.<eos> I'm taking a physiotherapy course. I used to be one and I want to start work again.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> I missed it.<eos> I would rather quit.<eos> But what you do is no fun.<eos> You work hard for people who ignore you.
Am I interrupting?<eos> Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal where the rest of your squad is.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> So you can kill them, too?<eos> We didn't start this, friend.<eos> Your people attacked us.<eos> You come to our island to run your tests, you fire on us, and what, - you expect us not to defend ourselves?<eos> - I don't know anything about that.<eos> We are scientists.<eos> So they sent you here to recover it?
I find myself having to tell them that it is.<eos> Anyway, we'll get Dawson to see to it.<eos> Don't worry yourself.<eos> Come and sit with me and help me.<eos> I need your help.<eos> No, I'm the only one who's not doing anything at the moment, so I should do it, if that's what's required.<eos> I will take the cats to be put to sleep, then I will come back and help you.<eos> There's no school any more.<eos> These children haven't been evacuated, so they're running wild.<eos> We'll find Lawrence, but I won't let anything happen to you.
The funeral of cardinal whathisname?<eos> They recited the kaddish in front of Notre Dame.<eos> Nowadays it's jewish outside and catholic inside<eos> Half and half Will you come with us, Viktor?<eos> - I'd do it for you, Andrei.<eos> - You are great for us.<eos> And Moses should come too.<eos> Our son<eos> It's the Louis Armstrong of the Simphonic even better than his dad<eos> - God bless you.
You got us drunk with that concerto, it was an obsession, a part of your body<eos> How many times did you direct in your head during these thirty years?<eos> I and Irina are tired!<eos> Will you free once and for all that poor Cajkovskij?<eos> - You were against the idea!<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> I adore Paris<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Follow her, she will bring you to your table
"We don't want to bury these dudes alive."<eos> Funny.<eos> Hey, over there, isn't that...<eos> Our former Prime Minister?<eos> Yup.<eos> You know, the vast majority of people in your situation tonight just follow orders.<eos> But you two, you think for yourselves.<eos> Your minds are free from convention.<eos> "Veritas vos liberabit."<eos> The truth will set you free.
You guys, you really went to town.<eos> - Well, we went as far as the truth permitted.<eos> - Throw in a little flair and every last issue was snapped up.<eos> Look, I made a mistake.<eos> I had no right to tell you about Claire.<eos> All you did was tell the truth.<eos> I am this close to giving you our next issue.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Look, getting to the truth is one thing, but you guys, you... you relish the humiliation.<eos> Degrading someone is fun for you.
- Jews have to wear a yellow star.<eos> As from today we Dutch will wear a flower of the same colour.<eos> The Germans won't arrest everyone, they'll stop persecuting you.<eos> They're our friends, I'll open.<eos> - Hurry, come in.<eos> - Hello, Anne.<eos> - Hello, Peter.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> There.<eos> Remove your shoes during the day... ..or the workers will hear you. Be careful.
-What is he saying?<eos> ...of torture, execution, crusades, blood, fire, violence and abuse!<eos> John wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians:<eos> "The one that does not love, remains in death."<eos> This is the Law!<eos> This is the Answer!<eos> -Now he'll pull himself together!<eos> -No! Silence server the power!<eos> The only way in which to defend oneself from the silence is to tell the truth.<eos> The truth will set you free!
- We got some hits?<eos> - How many hits did we get, Hugo?<eos> - 1,604,000.<eos> Yes, 1,604,000!<eos> Jeff, they killed Rockin' Roger on air.<eos> We're all goin' to jail.<eos> Hey, Joey, why don't you let me worry about that, OK?<eos> Why don't you guys just get ready to rock?<eos> OK, I gotta take this.<eos> But if anyone asks you what happened to Rockin' Roger, you just tell them we cannot comment at this time.
Was he Italian?<eos> He didn't scream with an accent.<eos> You guys cool?<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How's the new record coming?<eos> - Good, good.<eos> Well, it's... Tyler ate the engineer.<eos> He was a dick.<eos> What brings you around here?
You big dumb knuckle-heads are all the same:<eos> all nose and no intelligence.<eos> Enough!<eos> Nice try.<eos> Now back off!<eos> What was that?<eos> I told you there was something.<eos> Quiet, you fool!<eos> Dabgash!<eos> This land does not belong to you.
W hat's important is to have faith and live in the present.<eos> Buddha said that inside of all of us... there exists paradise and hell .<eos> Inside us?<eos> In other words, paradise and hell reside in your way of being.<eos> Whether you live in paradise or in hell ... depends on you.<eos> How you approach things can completely change what you see.<eos> So you might as well look upon life in a positive way.<eos> - Shimizu!<eos> -Wake up!<eos> Who told you to leave your posts?
Then for, like, 15, I didn't.<eos> Last year, déja vu.<eos> I just start to get him back, and he's gone again.<eos> That hurts.<eos> Okay, Al, I think what Dina means...<eos> I'm saying, how much do you give ?<eos> I'm sorry, this affects you how ?<eos> Friday night we're at a prom.<eos> Monday morning, you're leaving town.<eos> Did it affect you ?
Sometimes the simplest trick is the best way to lead someone to their death.<eos> Shoot!<eos> Shoot.!<eos> Your Highness, whether this is a trick or not, ...we should proceed with caution.<eos> What if their navy mutinies?<eos> That would be a disaster.<eos> Shoot!<eos> Besides the letter, ...I heard them mention friends here would get them arrows.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Scarecrow will protect you.
We cannot divide our strength.<eos> Your Honor, we stand alone on the battlefield.<eos> Without allied support, ...the chance for victory seems slight.<eos> I have never given up on my dream.<eos> Victory cannot rest on dreams alone.<eos> When will the east wind come?<eos> Based on new observations, ...at around one o'clock.<eos> If at that time you still trust your friends, ...light a lantern for a signal.<eos> If misfortune befalls Xiao Qiao, ...will you still fight a war of honor?<eos> I saw you once in the back of your family's estate.
Once we heard it, we went to the elevator shaft, but we couldn't get there in time.<eos> Is there any way you can get over there now?<eos> We've tried, but the substructure floor between here and the shaft is just too unstable, it could give out.<eos> He's right.<eos> We haven't even completed that substructure floor yet.<eos> That man could bleed out down there.<eos> We have to drill faster.<eos> Listen, guys, I promise you, we're going to get you guys up from out of there, okay?<eos> You just sit tight.<eos> The drill should reach you in a few hours.
Hey, we weren't going to miss your big night, huh?<eos> Hey, we've been to all the others.<eos> How could we miss your first New York City opening night?<eos> The first of many.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Hey, we should let you go and enjoy your success.<eos> Oh yeah, God bless.<eos> We love you honey.<eos> God bless.<eos> I love you too.
? Fear of the light that shines from you. ?<eos> ? They don't know that light was designed by God, ? ?<eos> ? And to those who would change you, ? ?<eos> ? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?<eos> ? I was born with my own special blessings. ? ?<eos> I let them shine and not give a damn. ?<eos> ? I was put on this Earth as I am. ?<eos> ? There is envy in those ? ?<eos> ? They don't understand, they can reach within, ? ?<eos> ? And to those who condemn you with fury and shame, ? ?
Living with Melanie's parents up in White Plains.<eos> Looks like I'm going to White Plains.<eos> Canvass the construction site.<eos> Someone must have seen something.<eos> Yeah, the foreman said that they have a problem with the homeless at night, so I figured I'd go down there later, try to catch them at the site.<eos> Homeless, White Plains.<eos> Homeless, White Plains.<eos> They're both kind of creepy.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did I scare you?
Posner and Klein just delivered your documents<eos> That was fast<eos> I know... I thought it would take them forever just to unload the truck<eos> Unload the truck?<eos> How many documents could there be?<eos> What was that you said about wasting our time?<eos> I can't believe you would do this!<eos> Let me guess!<eos> You got the boxes<eos> The judge ordered you to produce those documents
We are gonna fill it all... Look at you.<eos> That's my "Studio 54" look.<eos> Give what you can. Look, I'm sorry about everything with Dylan.<eos> I feel like we, we pushed you into it.<eos> Thank you for apologizing, but,<eos> I was complicit.<eos> I wanted to know.<eos> She's in love with you. I'm gonna love you, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Then where is she?<eos> Now it's my great pleasure to introduce you to the director of Children, Youth and Family Services at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Miss Jamie Chen.
So... sorry, no more.<eos> No more.<eos> So that's what I'll do.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's my plan.<eos> That's what I want to do.<eos> Let's just clean the world, so maybe the rest of us can sustain a little bit of life.<eos> So maybe that's what I'll do in the future.<eos> I'll help you out.<eos> I'll help you out, and I will cleanse, make more room for you.
I've forgotten half of this stuff.<eos> Sorry I missed the funeral, how was it?<eos> Most of the company showed up, lots of flowers, speeches... Everyone cried on cue.<eos> I'm sure Stephanie will loved it.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I see.<eos> Then I'll leave you two alone.<eos> When you're want the real thing, Michael, let me know.<eos> Endless possibilities.<eos> That's what 4Ever Innovations offers you.
Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> May I?<eos> It's great.<eos> I guess that's my little baby.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks. You seem good.<eos> Did you see Jenny out there? No.<eos> Bette and Tina, welcome to New York City.<eos> Come on! The party is waiting for you.
I'm just gonna wait for Amy to call.<eos> Okay,well,you can do that on your own.<eos> You're on,George.<eos> What the heck are you doing?<eos> Um,I'm just,uh,looking for some loose change.<eos> All right,well,get back out there.<eos> You're doing great,kid.<eos> Yeah,we might have a... tiny... tad little problem.<eos> Amy,I'm so sorry. I got tied up with a difficult delivery. But mother and baby are just fine.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
I see the note, Little One.<eos> We find out about the sister, we go to the sister.<eos> She takes a shot at us.<eos> Why did those things happen?<eos> Who called us to the house, told us everyone would suspect him?<eos> Who was standing there with that bomb, making himself a victim?<eos> He ran a campaign on us. Detectives.<eos> It's all over the wires. Howard Amis is making an announcement.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Thank you so much for being here.
But you need to cooperate and give us certain assurances.<eos> And Niedermann?<eos> Niedermann will be the scapegoat?<eos> He shot Lisbeth.<eos> There are charges against you that are difficult to overlook.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> And if you don't take care of it, I will contact the media.<eos> I've got names, dates, events, everything.<eos> I can blow you out of the water.
Would you two say that you are overly concerned... with the outrageous prices of store-bought wrapping paper? Yes.<eos> We're so concerned, we need to be alone right now.<eos> My daughter is selling wrapping paper to raise money for her school.<eos> Whoever sells the most wins a trip to Disneyland.<eos> Second place gets to cry while Rose and I go to Disneyland.<eos> Uh, Phil will take 10 rolls. - What?<eos> - You heard him.<eos> I'd leave now before he changes his mind.<eos> And Lem, I'll also put you down for 10.<eos> One for each time I told you not to play the needle game.
Just reading those numbers got us all angry.<eos> Who'd have thought that one day you'd get it into your head to redress the balance?<eos> How much has the total for police and bosses grown now?<eos> It just used to be those Red Brigade dickheads killing them, but now you guys have started too.<eos> When there's a war, there are always deaths.<eos> - Not only one side.<eos> - What war? Who declared it?<eos> Why do you think there's an army of the exploited backing you up? There's no one behind you.<eos> You're the front line of nothing.<eos> You're being cut off because people can't figure you out.

I'll help you.<eos> No way! You'll be better off if you don't know anything.<eos> I'll sort it out.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> This morning Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich, succumbed to injuries suffered during the deadly attack.<eos> On the occasion of the transport of the Deputy Protector's remains, before the coverage of the funeral itself, we will broadcast a radio workers' oath of loyalty to the German Reich.<eos> If anyone misses this without a serious reason, there will be consequences.<eos> That's all.<eos> Vrbata.<eos> Though I withdrew you from the microphone, our management wants you to read the oath.
You know, you think you know what the Company is, but you don't.<eos> It's a body that bends to the will of its head.<eos> And right now it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry because that's who General Krantz is.<eos> But what if a woman, a mother, ran it?<eos> Can you imagine the difference that would make?<eos> You think you're a mother?<eos> A mother's priority is her family.<eos> If I give Scylla back to the general he leaves me and Michael alone, and I get to spend time with my son in peace.<eos> I could sit here for days and try to explain to you why I did what I did.<eos> Suffice it to say I couldn't protect you then, but let me protect you now.
Enough to make a man want to go outside and kick a dog!<eos> But what exactly do you want us to do about it?<eos> We must make the public aware that the Battersea Hospital is anti-inoculation and therefore puts its patients at risk.<eos> I don't have any beds there.<eos> I have no intention of taking any beds there!<eos> Very good.<eos> I take it, Chairman, that you've called us in here to ask to ask if either of us sees Lady Carter in our private consulting rooms?<eos> I do not.<eos> - Nor me.<eos> - Gentlemen, thank you very much.
- Down by the docks.<eos> - Did you see it?<eos> There were witnesses.<eos> The sooner we get horses off the streets of London, the safer we'll all be.<eos> You'll never get horses off the streets of London, take my word for it.<eos> Examination room one, quickly.<eos> Constable, why don't you sit down?<eos> And keep out of the way, please.<eos> Sister, let's get her undressed.<eos> - I asked you to sit down.
Perhaps you'd like me to have you thrown out of the hospital?<eos> I have my duty.<eos> Your duty would matter less in here than my duty.<eos> Sister Russell, inform this fellow about hospital rules, if you'd be so kind.<eos> What's the problem, Constable?<eos> I have a suicide.<eos> Here, in my receiving room?<eos> Or do you mean in the mortuary which is downstairs?<eos> Attempted suicide.<eos> I think Dr. Culpin told you to sit down, or shall I send for an inspector?
Miss Grace Barnes.<eos> He sends me postcards regular... regularly.<eos> I knew I knew her face!<eos> It's her, and I knew it as soon as I saw her!<eos> Well, I couldn't be right certain, but I had that feeling.<eos> Miss Barnes?<eos> Grace?<eos> I knew it were you!<eos> There now, gently.<eos> My poppa saw you at the Bolton Variety two Whit Sundays ago.
I slipped in to watch you earlier.<eos> Yes! What was I doing to command such attention?<eos> Don't tell me now.<eos> Repairing that foundry man who'd lost the use of his hand.<eos> I'd seen it on your list.<eos> You alarm me, Head.<eos> If you've decided to branch out into surgery what hope for my livelihood and the many like me?<eos> Quite the opposite, my dear Dean.<eos> It's a funny thing...<eos> I know you like everybody knows you.
Do you?<eos> Does anyone know where my hamper is?<eos> Miss Luckes gave it to us... to help us.<eos> I turn my back for five minutes and it's gone!<eos> Tell me, please! How is this possible?<eos> Orderly!<eos> Orderly!<eos> Mrs. Baker!<eos> She's lost a lot of blood, Sister. Down below.<eos> Maud, every time you come in here, it's as a consequence of your drinking too much gin and falling off something, or bumping into something, or seeing two of something speeding towards you and not knowing which of them to jump out of the way of!
When you get yourself a chap, you know, yeah, and you got better things to do?<eos> - Who helps us then?<eos> - That won't happen.<eos> You're a good woman, Ada Russell.<eos> But I know what this is, even if you don't.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You cradle my baby like a pet cat.<eos> I do no such thing!<eos> Like I said, you're kind and you're good to my children.<eos> But you knock on my door for your reasons and I let you in for mine.
Probably not.<eos> Say you wanted somebody to make you a piece of toast.<eos> - Would you call Sock?<eos> - I would not, no.<eos> Well gee, Sam, thanks.<eos> I mean, I feel really valued that you would give the most responsible person a letter to mail me so I don't worry about you.<eos> I... put a stamp on it myself.<eos> It doesn't even matter.<eos> Oh, but there is one bit of... one bit of information.<eos> Ted fired the three of you and is going to have you arrested if you trespass and show your face around here.
But you don't think of us that way.<eos> I mean, instead of coming to me with your problems, you took a month-long bender with your buddies.<eos> You ran away.<eos> I wasn't running away from you. I was running away from the Devil.<eos> Well, you know what? I can't tell the difference.<eos> I'm really really sorry.<eos> You know that I thought you were dead?<eos> It would have made sense, right?<eos> I mean, your life is always in danger.<eos> And when you guys disappeared I just thought that one of the souls finally got you.
You guys are jerks.<eos> - You know, i bet you're right.<eos> - Yeah. You see the suit he's wearin'?<eos> Ah, it's-- Looks great on him.<eos> You don't buy that thing off the rack, you know. Hey!<eos> Ho! What the hell are you doing?<eos> !<eos> So, uh, in my experience, You guys got, like, 3 or 4 minutes before the cops get here.<eos> You better grab your painting. I'm gonna go to a party.<eos> Uh, if it's ragin', i'll text you.
The flight of Dennis Tito to the International Space Station... was an enormously significant accomplishment... and many people watching in the space community cheered.<eos> They thought this was great.<eos> It's a new age that has begun.<eos> Space Adventures Limited now offers trips... to the International Space Station for $33 million.<eos> You learn about the rocket.<eos> You learn about the spaceship that you're going to fly in.<eos> You learn about the space station. You learn about what it's like to live and eat and work... and even go to the bathroom in space.<eos> To get to the space station... space tourists must hitch a ride with the Russians... in a Soyuz capsule.<eos> It's flown successfully for 35 years.<eos> This great feat of human engineering... will deliver you from the ground to orbit in less than eight minutes.
You're lying.<eos> You're lying.<eos> - I don't work for the Company.<eos> - Six words that never prove true.<eos> Come on, man! This is over.<eos> Look around.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I am here for a conference. I don't know who told you otherwise. I do.
Caden's a bad man.<eos> He raps about how he's killed half a dozen men.<eos> We nail him for this, we can put him behind bars where he belongs.<eos> You gettin' these shots right here, right? Platinum, baby- That's what I do.<eos> That's what I go for right now, man. You feeling me? Yeah.<eos> â™ªâ™ª Now, that looks good.<eos> On to the next.<eos> You got a moment to speak to Detective Riley?<eos> I don't talk to cops, man.<eos> My manager will show you to the door.
That won't be a problem.<eos> Gillian Foster.<eos> Don Hughes, youth investigation division at metro.<eos> Detective.<eos> Mr. Hughes is here to welcome us to the Burch case.<eos> "Welcome" isn't the word I'd use.<eos> Well, we won't get in your way, detective.<eos> Too late.<eos> You work for the Burches, right?<eos> As far as I'm concerned, they're still suspects. At puts you right in my way.
Who the hell steals from charity?<eos> I want my pension back!<eos> Hollin is a crook!<eos> All the money is gone.<eos> I provided the names of all my foreign companies to the S.E.C. weeks ago.<eos> You provided them with the names of three investment management companies you had a stake in... but a lot of people believe there are many more.<eos> Losses my company incurs are my responsibility... but the idea that I'm hiding more money is ludicrous.<eos> My father's talked to 10 different people today and told them the same thing.<eos> He's gonna answer our questions.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Jerry... he has a prescription for medical marijuana.<eos> It's the only thing that helps his social anxiety disorder. I see.<eos> Well... sorry, Jerry, you're not in California anymore.<eos> And the federal government considers marijuana an illegal controlled substance, period.<eos> So you're either straight, or you're out of the program.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did Mary yell at someone already?<eos> No, no, Jerry's just bummed 'cause he can't toke up.<eos> Yeah, we get a lot of that.<eos> Have a P.B. and J. Sandwich, cheer you right up.
- Right, he didn't speak.<eos> - He served his punishment.<eos> - He served his punishment.<eos> But now he's really sick.<eos> Those pills aren't for your illness.<eos> It's numb.<eos> It's completely numb.<eos> You were sent to us by God.<eos> I've heard you cure the poor.<eos> God bless you!
Previously on Forbidden Science<eos> Endless possibility, that's what 4ever Innovation offer you.
I don't have the necessary ring.<eos> But I will, within the hour.<eos> Celestia.<eos> It is ended between us.<eos> Dorcas and I... Are you saying that it's mutual? With this postmistress?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is recent and it has come from nowhere, but yes.<eos> You and I must be business partners only.<eos> From today.<eos> I gave years to you.
That is something.<eos> I suppose I shall return to London.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So glad the post office is once more open for business.<eos> May I?<eos> Unfortunately, my earlier attempt to make matters clear was interrupted.<eos> But I am now clear.<eos> I have spoken to James.<eos> And the honest man has told you what?
And the honest man has told you what?<eos> That indeed you had a business association.<eos> Anything more was imagined.<eos> Well, well...<eos> Perhaps you had better sit down.<eos> I am not tired.<eos> Whatever game you are playing, madam, you will not disconcert me, nor will I believe that James is a party to it.<eos> What will you believe, I wonder?<eos> Let me see... if you are to marry the "honest" James.<eos> Has he warned you that he often suffers from insomnia?
What is it?<eos> Do you have any ailments or conditions I should know about?<eos> No, I'm in perfect health.<eos> So you sleep well?<eos> Ah, not especially.<eos> But with a Japanese neck pillow... a book?<eos> Yes, that usually sorts it.<eos> I think you should put that away, don't you?<eos> Dorcas...<eos> What I should have told you, what I failed to tell you, is that I have a past.
Dorcas...<eos> What I should have told you, what I failed to tell you, is that I have a past.<eos> Quite a past.<eos> Quite a present too.<eos> A self-made man?<eos> Proud owner of a chain of hotels.<eos> And all the time, bank-rolled by a rich widow.<eos> But more than that, James... ..you shared a life with a woman.<eos> You denied her and you have made an utter fool of me.<eos> I lied to you, I admit it, but only to keep you.
That's kind, child, but I'm not one for retiring. Got too much get up and go in me.<eos> Aye, we noticed.<eos> Two years time, Pa, Edmund will have left, there'll be a bit more room.<eos> Come live with us then?<eos> Don't worry, son, I'll help you with your trap.<eos> Miss Margaret... ..I am guilty of impropriety and deceit.<eos> I spent many hours at the hotel.<eos> Oh... I am unhappily well aware of the reason.<eos> Mrs Brice Coulson.<eos> Deliberately kept from you that I was employed there.
In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups.<eos> The police, who investigate crime, and the Crown Prosecutors, who prosecute the offenders.<eos> These are their stories.<eos> Follow the line.<eos> Follow the nurses.<eos> The nurses will take you to the assembly hall.
I don't care.<eos> I want to do both.<eos> Mark and Susan need to know Gilmore's been held responsible for Debbie's death.<eos> Good. I'm with you.<eos> How are you bearing up?<eos> I'll feel better when Gilmore's in prison.<eos> We all will.<eos> We've got a strong case but there's a long way to go.<eos> Promise me he won't get away with this.<eos> The liaison officer will show you where to sit.
Nick Bentley was 24.<eos> He was respected and loved by all who knew him.<eos> He had a bright future ahead of him - a future cut short by Ray Griffin's failure to assist him... ..because Nick Bentley was gay.<eos> In failing to help Nick Bentley, the defendant deliberately misconducted himself, and breached the trust we all place in our public officers.<eos> There is no Good Samaritan law.<eos> Put simply, we are not obliged to help one another.<eos> Whatever the events of that night, PC Griffin did not commit misconduct.<eos> That's a serious charge with grave consequences.<eos> Would it be right to convict a well-respected police officer because a drug dealer killed his colleague? No.<eos> I urge you not to convict.
Now I know.<eos> Seems like I have to try again.<eos> Sunbae.<eos> Thank you for helping me.<eos> I wasn't helping you.<eos> I just couldn't stand seeing these annoying acts.<eos> What?<eos> Ji Hoo?<eos> Yes, he had to appear right at that moment.<eos> Who asked you to do these things?
Thank you for helping me.<eos> I wasn't helping you.<eos> I just couldn't stand seeing these annoying acts.<eos> What?<eos> Ji Hoo?<eos> Yes, he had to appear right at that moment.<eos> Who asked you to do these things?<eos> Didn't you say to let Geum Jan Di suffer?<eos> I just told you to scare her so that she would admit her mistake!<eos> - Who told you to do that?
Are you saying you don't want it?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Being kidnapped by a psycho like you here, can I still be in the right state of mind?<eos> The moment I see your face, it feels like bugs are crawling all over my body.<eos> Get me my uniform now!<eos> What is this?<eos> !<eos> Throw it away!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Didn't you hear me asking you to throw it right away?
How did you get back to the island?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - At Dharma headquarters in Ann Arbor. Doing research.<eos> What's important right now... How did you get back here?<eos> To 1977?<eos> - What's going on? - Don't look at me.<eos> - I just carried his luggage.<eos> - Jack, how?<eos> - We were on a plane, and...<eos> - Who told you to get on a plane?
Are you ready, Lorenzo?<eos> Five, four, three, two, one, and going live.<eos> Do not attempt to adjust your television set.<eos> We have taken control of all networks.<eos> We have disabled all remote controls.<eos> We instruct the president of the United States to close all golf courses and ban the corrupting practice of golf.<eos> We further instruct that he and his colleagues cease eating meat immediately.<eos> If the president fails to do this, within the next hour, the city of Los Angeles will entirely be destroyed.<eos> So there!<eos> I told you not to switch the channels.
No, wait.<eos> - Incredible.<eos> - Quiet, rookie.<eos> Shoot the bridge!<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Waxer, Boil.<eos> Where have you two slackers been?<eos> Sir, there is an explanation.<eos> We got sidetracked.<eos> I think I see what sidetracked you.
You are responsible.<eos> These men are depending on you and this time so am I.<eos> But, Master, last time I...<eos> Attention!<eos> Everyone!<eos> Attention!<eos> Alright, men, listen up.<eos> I'm taking over the Defender and I'm leaving Ahsoka in charge.<eos> She'll lead the mission when we engage what remains of the blockade.<eos> Commander Ahsoka will fill you in on the full plan. - Master, wait!
Seriously?<eos> Parking garage?<eos> - What?<eos> It's pretty cliché.<eos> Next thing, you'll tell me they'll be pulling up in a black Suburban with tinted windows.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, someone's been watching way too many Bruckheimer films.<eos> Five minutes, Detective.<eos> That's all you get.<eos> NYPD thanks you for your cooperation.
Move, move, move!<eos> Stand up straight.<eos> Make a line you can be proud of.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're supposed to be leadership material.<eos> Mrs. Newlin.<eos> I know you're wondering what this is all about.<eos> Well, God needs your obedience.<eos> God needs your will and your faith.<eos> And in due time, all will be revealed to you.
I think that after all your trials heartache and pain God wants you to have a reward.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Let me reward you, Jason.<eos> Let me help you find your way back to joy.<eos> We take them all out at once.<eos> Pre-emptive strike.<eos> Of course, so the federal government can bomb us back into the Middle Ages.<eos> Things were better then.<eos> Then go to Romania and live in a cave, you ranchero poser.<eos> Godric has protected you made you rich, and you stand here spitting and scratching like infants.
Excellency.<eos> I leave you to talk in private.<eos> Your majesty, may I congratulate on your marriage, wish you good health and prosperity.<eos> Although the device of the lady who preceded you on the throne was the most happy. I have no doubt that it is you, yourself who will realise that mortal.<eos> Thank you, excellency.<eos> I know that the emperor will rejoice to have such a virtuous and amiable queen on the throne.<eos> I must tell you it would be impossible for me to overstate the joy and happiness which each Englishman that I have met have expressed to me on hearing of your marriage.<eos> Especially, as it is said, that you're a peace-maker who'll be continually trying to persuade his majesty to restore his daughter Mary to favor.<eos> I promise you, Excellency. That I will continue to show favor to the Lady Mary. And do my best to deserve the title of peace maker you so gallantly have given me.<eos> If you do so, I think you'll find, Madame, that without the pain of labour and childbirth, You will gain the treasure of a daughter who may please you even more than your own children by the king.
All is well again.<eos> All is mended up.<eos> Sir Francis Bryan, my lady.<eos> - Lady Mary.<eos> - My Lord.<eos> I'm very glad you've come to see me.<eos> I've written a letter congratulating the king on his marriage.<eos> And begging leave to wait upon Queen Jane. Or do Her Grace such services it would please her to command me.<eos> I'm afraid, Lady Mary. I've not come here to discuss pleasantaries.<eos> His Majesty urged you to sign this.
After all of my mother's sufferings.<eos> I understand. But may I suggest that you could sign the document. And then make what is called a protestation apart.<eos> Is that not hypocrisy?<eos> Surely the Emperor's against my signing such a document.<eos> And the Holy Father.<eos> Lady Mary, I must tell you in honesty that- that the Emperor's no longer inclined to interfere any further in this matter.<eos> After all, you are not his subject and- and since he is seeking a new alliance with the king, He would in truth be most reluctant to offend him in any way.<eos> Then, I'm on my own?<eos> What if I do not sign it?<eos> It is very possible that the king would put you to death.
I'm very pleased with you. I will shortly prove it.<eos> Lady Rochford.<eos> Yes, your Majesty.<eos> Take this to Lady Bryan,<eos> Tell her to use it buy clothes for the Lady Elizabeth.<eos> Yes, madam.<eos> And you must think of a gift for the Lady Mary.<eos> I'm looking so forward to meeting her.<eos> Your majesty is very kind.<eos> Lady Rochford, it's not your fault that your husband betrayed you.
Let me get that for you,Doc.<eos> No,I got it.<eos> Call the Philadelphia Police Department.<eos> Have them alert the SWAT team.<eos> Can I tell them what they'll be dealing with?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Could be a leak or a spill.<eos> Could be snakes on a train.?<eos> Okay,baby doll,Mommy's got one last thing to do.<eos> Hi,if you're calling about temporary employment, I'm sorry,but we have everyone we need for the next event, but please leave your name and number and we'll put you on our list.
So, I have to beat him at poker?<eos> No, you do what you're good at.<eos> Figure out what that is and challenge him.<eos> However, there's one more step to get the devil to agree to the challenge.<eos> Ok. What's that?<eos> I can't tell you that right now.<eos> What?<eos> We had a deal!<eos> Look, until I'm safe, Standing on consecrated ground, I have to keep one ace up my sleeve.<eos> I promise you I'll call you as soon as I set foot in the vatican.
KONDRASHOFF.<eos> HE'S LIKE A RUSSIAN DUDE.<eos> HE'S EX-MILITARY OR SOMETHING.<eos> HE HANGS WITH THIS GANG, UM...<eos> UH, CHOOMA... CHOOMA, I THINK.<eos> IT MEANS, UH, "PLAGUE" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.<eos> HOLD ON TO HIM.<eos> COME ON, MAN.<eos> I'M HELPING OUT!<eos> I'M GIVING YOU WHAT YOU NEED HERE!
LISTEN UP, GUYS, WHEN INFERNO GOES OFF, IT'S GONNA SOUND LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD. MAKE SURE YOU GOT YOUR EARPLUGS IN.<eos> EARPLUGS.<eos> OKAY, OPEN THE OUTSIDE GATES WHEN YOU TRIGGER INFERNO, SPIKE.<eos> COPY THAT.<eos> IRINA?<eos> IRINA, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR A VERY LOUD ALARM.<eos> IT'S A SECURITY FEATURE OF THE HOUSE.<eos> NOW, IT'S GONNA BE SO LOUD THAT'S IT'S GONNA... IT'S GONNA MAKE THE GUNMEN NOT BE ABLE TO THINK.<eos> IT'S GONNA BE A SHOCK TO THEIR BRAIN, BUT IT'S HARMLESS.<eos> IT'S HARMLESS, BUT TO KEEP YOU SAFE, I NEED YOU AND THE CHILDREN TO STAY RIGHT UP AGAINST THE SOUTH WALL.
What were you planning on doing?<eos> Before you nazis shot me?<eos> I was visiting my girlfriend.<eos> We didn't shoot you.<eos> Yeah, tell that to the judge.<eos> I'm suing your ass, big-time.<eos> Yeah, okay, that's a plan.<eos> Here's your problem, Brandon--<eos> The gun that you were carrying last night was the same gun used to kill Felix Hanson,<eos> The gun that sydney stole for you, ich puts you both in a whole lot of trouble.
a few guys just through the customs doors over there.<eos> so, straight across and out here to the trucks.<eos> like i said, low profile all the way.<eos> is it true that accused serial killer peter wilkins is being taken into custody today?<eos> and what do you have to say to the victims families?<eos> ma'am, please, just stand back.<eos> eddie, low profile.<eos> hey, i followed every protocol you sent, this isn't on us.<eos> right this way, guys.<eos> i know how some of you must be feeling right now, and i'm sorry.
Sniveling lackey pigs is what you are, you know that?<eos> Damn lackeys.<eos> - Calm down, Lee.<eos> - Make me.<eos> Stop right there.<eos> You let him go right now, you hear me?<eos> It's not loaded.<eos> Now, you put that down right now, you idiot.<eos> - But, Daddy -<eos> - Scared the pants off you, didn't he?
My best friend is funny, intelligent, creative, beautiful and successful and very kind.<eos> And she's also impulsive, frustrating, but I would not have her any other way.<eos> And the best part about Brooke Davis is that she always puts friends first.<eos> So if you are ever in any kind of trouble, now you know who to call.<eos> I can't think of anyone I would rather have watching over you.<eos> It's been a month, Brooke.<eos> You've got to stop spying on them like this.<eos> Thank you, concernicus.<eos> How would you know what I've been up to?<eos> 'Cause I've been watching the both of you.
All right!<eos> And are you two, little girl in the red.<eos> Ben want you to come backstage.<eos> You too, little girl with a puppy t-shirt.<eos> They want me to come backstage? Oh, my god!<eos> But, we have to do another thing!<eos> It's a dream come true!<eos> All right, right this way, girls.<eos> Yeah, come on in everyone.<eos> The band is waiting for you.
Oh, well... We... We wear this to symbolize how pure we are and how we...<eos> Don't approve thing of being naughty or filthy.<eos> Yeah, that's good. Get a closeup on a purity rings.<eos> Closeup on a purity rings. That's wonderful, boys.<eos> It's good that little girls can see your concert is not have to be about sex.<eos> We understand, that in the concert tonight, you'll be dowsing girls in the audience with white foam is that correct?<eos> Aha. Yeah.<eos> Aha. Yeah.<eos> Yep. Well, you can give an audience a peak.<eos> What you say, girls, do you want the Jonas Brothers seduce you with their white foam?
Previously on Forbidden Science<eos> Endless possibility, that's what 4Ever Innovations offer you.
- No, Clark.<eos> No.<eos> He's still out there.<eos> Anything that was good in him is now gone.<eos> No one's safe... not till you destroy that beast.<eos> I can't believe we lost track of that thing.<eos> If I had their powers, I would have gotten the job done.<eos> They're the ones that screwed up, not us.<eos> So quick to assign blame.<eos> I taught you to take care of one another.
Janice Austin ?<eos> That's the one.<eos> What the hell is she doing here in Albuquerque ?<eos> Even money she winters in Taos.<eos> You, back behind the barrier now.<eos> Hi, Janice Austin, channel six news.<eos> I'd like to speak to the person in charge here.<eos> Sorry,absolutely no one's allowed beyond that point, and that includes media, no exceptions.<eos> And you are...<eos> The person telling you and your cameraman to get back behind the barrier, or you'll be arrested.
- Wait, they're a team.<eos> - A team of what?<eos> - Wait, why are you all here?<eos> - I got a text saying to meet you.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.<eos> [PHONES BEEPING] GOSSIP GIRL:<eos> You wanted to meet Gossip Girl?<eos> Well, look around.<eos> You just did.<eos> I'm nothing without you. And while most high-school friendships fade it's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
Daniel seems to have doubts.<eos> I wouldn't read too much into that.<eos> Just nerves, I guess.<eos> Big night.<eos> I suppose these are here on your account?<eos> Dad's, mostly.<eos> Ex-marines.<eos> Your father's here?<eos> Private chopper from London. Should be here before nightfall for the big announcement.<eos> Introduce you, if you like.
They're not going to kill us.<eos> Because we're going to give them what they want.<eos> Blood?<eos> Better.<eos> Sex.<eos> Silence, children.<eos> Silence.<eos> First, an announcement.<eos> The toilets are broken again.<eos> We are fixing the problem, but let me warn you.
This isn't going to work.<eos> Not if we keep stopping.<eos> I'm saying we need to split up.<eos> Fine with me. I agree.<eos> Franklin, you should come with me.<eos> Nah... no, no, no, you're with me and Greer.<eos> Sun's been moving that way, we'll call it west...<eos> Uh, Eli, Franklin, Palmer... and Curtis, you head that way.<eos> We'll test every 20 minutes or so.<eos> After two hours, you head south-east... that should take you back in the direction of the gate.
Here's our computer relays.<eos> And this is like a cube of Chaos that can destroy the world in one second.<eos> And here's some of our evil minions.<eos> We have everything we need here!<eos> Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?<eos> I'll take a Sprite.<eos> Get the Coon a Sprite, general Disarray.<eos> As you can see, we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.<eos> You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...<eos> Do you still have that "who is the Coon" t-shirt I gave you?
Oh,my god.<eos> They're famous!<eos> Oh,hello,sirs.<eos> It is such an honor to meet you.<eos> Oh,katie,i'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy.<eos> May we come in,please.<eos> Oh,certainly.<eos> Though i fear we do look a mess.<eos> Pretty nice place you have here.<eos> Network must be paying you well.
We have taps on all of Summers' phones and we were monitoring his credit cards. And to have him kidnapped like this is bad, awful, horrible, and crappy for us.<eos> We're thrilled not to be officially involved but if we can help you behind the scenes...<eos> I don't want you talking with the FBI on my behalf.<eos> - We decided. - All right.<eos> Bye, Kitty.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> I mean, what would they say, anyway, behind the scenes?<eos> Well, they would probably say give the family the money for the ransom.<eos> In fact, if you could get proof of life on Summers the FBI would unfreeze his accounts.<eos> Then you could put tracer bills in the cash that the Summers withdraw follow the transmitters, let the ransom lead you to kidnappers or to Summers himself, if this is another one of his frauds.
It's not a great deal of time to explain what's been happening to me for the last 35 years.<eos> It's the only thing I kept.<eos> Do you reckon you could climb over them?<eos> Not with you laughing at me, sir.<eos> They must know you're a fan.<eos> If you've let the paparazzi in, I won't get my autograph.<eos> Rock and roll.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I can't see that from here.<eos> Who let you in? Are you press?
Stay there.<eos> One cc in a 10% solution.<eos> Stovaine.<eos> And you are all, of course, aware that there has been considerable resistance to the routine use of this drug.<eos> And to spinal anaesthesia in general.<eos> One in 300 biniodide of mercury.<eos> Why?<eos> Because stovaine is derived from a compound with a notoriously poisonous and treacherous nature, namely cocaine.<eos> Ah, Sister.<eos> It's good of you to join us.
Do I make myself clear?<eos> Yes, Matron.<eos> Details of the location and nature of your first four patients, with letters of introduction to each.<eos> Now finish your day in the receiving room, and start your first appointment at 8am tomorrow.<eos> "The Reverend J Edwards of Tooting.<eos> "Condition... haemorrhoids."<eos> Remember to warm your hands.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Come on! This is the last thing this woman needs.<eos> I'm arresting you on suspicion of attempted suicide and ask you to accompany me to the station.
Sickness?<eos> Take a seat, the doctor will be with you shortly.<eos> Next, please.<eos> The child has a raised temperature and can't keep food down.<eos> Queue three, examination room two, non-urgent.<eos> Next, please.<eos> To Dr. Ingrams for stitching.<eos> Next.<eos> May I, please?<eos> Dr. Meredith in Hackney High Street will see you for a shilling.
And have you moved your bowels recently?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you very much for asking.<eos> My Lords, ladies and gentlemen... "... it requires greater courage to make yet another speech before you on behalf of the hospitals of this great city than you probably suspect.<eos> "It is quite easy...<eos> "It is quite an easy...<eos> It's quite an easy thing to go down to Limehouse or to Bow to inflame the passions of the workless and unemployed.<eos> And that passion may one day sweep law and order before it...<eos> That passion may one day sweep law and order before it in a wild tumult of lawless riot and fury.<eos> But I plead with you to leave the voluntarily supported hospitals as your olive branch of peace.
I hope this is enough.<eos> Well, as long as somebody pays for it, guess there's no harm done.<eos> But I don't wanna see you in here ever again without your parents, understand?<eos> - Thanks, mister.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> You're not gonna steal anymore, are you?<eos> Be good, Katie.<eos> Welcome aboard, everyone.<eos> We will be doing system checks here before heading to open ocean and submerging to our operational running depth.<eos> You should be receiving your sedatives, and we'll escort you to sleeping berths.
- Brigade two, unit four.<eos> Got it.<eos> On Track Two!<eos> Line up!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> If one ofyou runners opens his mouth, I order to shoot.<eos> Soldiers!<eos> Prisoners!<eos> I'm not wrong!<eos> I address you as soldiers. Although you're still just the crap of society.

Although you're still just the crap of society.<eos> Thugs and goons.<eos> - Come on. - Be grateful.<eos> We'll see you in battle today.<eos> The Fathers send you into battle.
How in God's name, we suppose to bannish by idolatry and superstition and empty ritual from our churches when they are still practice here at court.<eos> When shall I meet the Majesty, my lord?<eos> very soon.<eos> Majesty is most eager to talk to you.<eos> In the meantime, he encouraged you to write a lengthy declaration of everything you did during the rebellion and the reasons for it.
Pardon?<eos> What for?<eos> I have committed an assault within the verge of your court.<eos> An assault? you?<eos> But you're an artist.<eos> I was painting the picture of Lady Misseldon that Your Majesty commisioned, but a gentleman interrupted us.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I threw the gentleman into some shelves.<eos> You did the right thing, Master Holbein.<eos> And I'll forgive you freely, I might have done the same thing myself.
Then I say God has mercy on us.<eos> God bless you and keep you, my own dear husband.<eos> And you too my darlings, but I shall be all right for I trust in the honestly of His Grace.<eos> He showed me a letter, it was written to the council on our behalf and it was all good.<eos> He said he still charity for us and I doubt any harm will come to us.<eos> After all, what could be gained by when the North most now be appeased and quiet.<eos> Then our daughters don't weap.<eos> Your yorkshire lass, Yorkshire lass have iron in their souls just like your good mother.<eos> You will see me again soon, I promise.<eos> God bless you Mr. Aske

Sir Ralph Ellerker.<eos> Sir Ralph. You're accused of taking part in the late insurrection that so wretchedly offended His King's Majesty and the whole realm.<eos> We have taken account of your deposition to the court that you joined the rebels out of fear for your life and the lives of your dependants.<eos> We also note your subsequent vows of contrition.<eos> We ask you to sign this.<eos> What is it?<eos> An oath.<eos> You swear that you are heartily sorry that you have offended the King's Highness in this rebellion.<eos> You promise never again to make unlawful assembly and also promise to inform against anyone else who does.<eos> From henceforth you shall be a true and faithful subject unto our king our sovereign Lord Henry VIII, king of England and France and on earth, supreme head of the Church of England so help you God.
Make way.<eos> You there, stop what you're doing.<eos> Stop your labors, do you hear?<eos> - In the name of the king, make way.<eos> - Cease your labors.<eos> You are traitorous villains, all of you.<eos> You are bound by law and by nature to obey the King's Majesty and yet you followed the traitor Aske and rose in unholy rebellion against him.<eos> And you...<eos> It is my purpose here to show a fearful example to those who would disobey his most gracious and sacred Majesty who, after all, in his mercy, granted you a pardon whereupon you continued your willful disobedience and traitorous hearts.<eos> For these reasons, the king will not forgive you.
I pray Jesu, if he wills, to send us a prince.<eos> Take my hand.<eos> Let me have a look now.<eos> Breathe deep, Your Majesty. Good. Good.<eos> - Lady Mary.<eos> - Yes, madam?<eos> The box.<eos> It used to belong to your mother.<eos> I think she is here with us.<eos> I believe with all my heart she will help you.
The King's given orders personally that all the rooms and cambers and passages around the Prince's apartment are to be scrubbed with soap, three times daily.<eos> the Prince also has his own kitchen where all his meals are prepared Now that he's weaned from mother jack.<eos> everything that he might touch is to be washed, and everything he might eat, tasted for poison.<eos> His personal chamberlain supervises his meals, his robes, and daily bath.<eos> He must be the cleanest baby in England.<eos> He is the most precious baby in England.<eos> My Lord!<eos> Thank you, Lady Bryan.<eos> Why have you come here?<eos> Has the King banished you to the nursery for letting Cardinal Pole slip through your fingers?
not with the boy.<eos> The King listens to him.<eos> that makes him dangerous to everyone.<eos> I shall have to destroy him.<eos> It's a pity.<eos> He makes me laugh. I'm sure he makes a lot of women laugh.<eos> It's a very small thing to you isn't It, Edward...<eos> I think there are more important things; yes.<eos> No doubt you're right.<eos> But as long as you do... don't expect me to be faithful to you.
Not my conscience but yours.<eos> I see that you are afraid of guilt by association and would rather I perjured my own soul.<eos> Alas, it's the only thing in this world I have left.<eos> I am sorry you choose not to save yourself.<eos> All for Christ.<eos> All for Christ.<eos> Majesty.<eos> Mr. Lambert has gone to his execution.<eos> And to hell.<eos> Princess Mary begs you to spare the life of the Lady Salisbury who she says was like a mother to her.
And you became black in the process? Honorary.<eos> - It's very exciting.<eos> I'll bet.<eos> - Here, put these on.<eos> I'll take you in.<eos> Booties.<eos> The son came home from a camping trip and found her and this.<eos> 'My dearest children, 'I know this comes as a shock to you, and for that, I'm deeply sorry. 'But I have good reason.<eos> 'As you know, when you were all little, 'I went in search of and ultimately found 'my own biological family.<eos> 'What I never told you is that I discovered 'my birth father had died of Huntington's disease, 'a terrible illness for which there is no cure.
- We're right here, Angela.<eos> Come on.<eos> We need to get a line in her to intubate, excuse me.<eos> We have Angela heavily sedated and are moving her into quarantine.<eos> At this point, we can't tell if what she has is bacterial, viral, or environmental.<eos> Is she going to die? I don't know.<eos> She's in extreme cardiac distress.<eos> Her blood work shows elevated alkaloids.<eos> That could be a cause or a symptom.<eos> I'll keep you posted.
Causes numbness, cardiac and respiratory failure.<eos> And it's not something that people are exposed to accidentally.<eos> She was poisoned.<eos> I was just about to call you. Lily Adams was poisoned.<eos> Something called Aconitine.<eos> They're testing Angela for it as we speak.<eos> I'll see your poison and raise you one suspect.<eos> The biker who shot Lily served ten years, got out, and immediately moved to Albuquerque.<eos> The hits just keep on coming.<eos> Can I help you?
But two days later, my brother, the one who actually nabbed the coins, he went to bed with a headache and woke up dead.<eos> So what makes you think Lily got the gold?<eos> We stashed it at her motel.<eos> Couple days after the shooting, one of my guys went back to get it, and it was gone.<eos> So either he took it, or Lily's family took it.<eos> I can't believe you're accusing us of stealing millions of dollars in gold.<eos> Or worse, killing our mother for it.<eos> With our sister lying therein a coma.<eos> All right, keep your voices down.<eos> No one's accusing you of anything.
Maybe it's time we returned the favor.<eos> You know,when you missed your appointment on monday,we thought maybe you skipped out on us.<eos> Yeah,well,as you can see,I was otherwise detained.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> No.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Samuel heller--the john doe who died in the club fire.<eos> You sure you didn't see him when you were in that back hallway?<eos> No.<eos> Well,like I told you that night,I was only back there for a minute.
Et dimitte a nobis... ..debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus a debitoribus nostris.<eos> Only you can save us from the beast, Sir William.<eos> God bless and keep you in this enterprise.
Please accept our apologies.<eos> We're truly anguished by the turmoil our arrival has caused.<eos> This is a momentous day.<eos> Until now, we believed we were the only intelligent life in the universe.<eos> We're overjoyed to find that we're not alone.<eos> My name is Anna.<eos> And I am the leader of my people.<eos> We're delighted to meet you. But we need your help.<eos> We're far from home.<eos> After we've replenished ourselves and shared with you what we can we will leave you, hopefully better than we found you.
Something's in my glass.<eos> My God,that's a human finger.<eos> It's quite simple.<eos> Whatever Agent Booth says,you respond with whatever word or phrase pops into your head.<eos> And vice versa.<eos> Well,that's ridiculous.<eos> I can't properly respond without careful thought.<eos> Can't we just make it a drinking game? No.<eos> This is a valuable,psychological tool,Agent Booth.<eos> When you respond viscerally we can get to the root of your emotional issues and figure out what binds you two together as partners.
OK? Thank you, for everything.<eos> Do you know what you're going to call him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I only had girls' names ready.<eos> Do you think erm...<eos> Do you think he'd be OK if I called him erm Stanley?<eos> I know it's old-fashioned.<eos> It was my dad's name.<eos> See you around, Stanley.<eos> So, who locked you in?
Damn it.<eos> I can't talk right now!<eos> Sal?<eos> Hey, so what?<eos> Did you find it?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> All right, well, who've you talked to?<eos> Bangers from Grape Street, Rollin 60's, HCC, neighbors, hookers, anybody we can pop.<eos> What about Big Wayne?<eos> Listen, I don't give a *** how many "God bless you's" he throws around.
Well, let them in.<eos> If it isn't my lottery tickets. What up?<eos> How you doing, Big Wayne?<eos> Well, since the settlement from the city,<eos> I've been able to get full-time physical therapy.<eos> How's your youth center going?<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> You should come by and give a motivational speech.<eos> Yeah, maybe we should do that, huh?<eos> So, what brings you two here? I'll be honest.
And all our wastewater output is up to specs.<eos> Well,Mr. Pierce,we're not here in regards to your environmental impact.<eos> We're here investigating the murder of Jimmy Castigan.<eos> Well,I never heard of him.<eos> You ever heard of sodium hydroxide,'cause a large amount was used to kill Mr. Castigan?<eos> Well,I'm sure all ours is accounted for.<eos> We store them in the old treatment building.<eos> Nobody's been in there since we shut it down.<eos> Would you take us there,please?<eos> Like I told you,nobody's been in here for years.
Please, ma'am.<eos> A gift for your sister or brother!<eos> For the love of God, please, ma'am.<eos> AH right.<eos> See how I did it?<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Firat, a lighter costs 500.<eos> Gulistan, tissues are 500.<eos> Go for it!<eos> If somebody asks you if you're in school, just say yes, okay?
Everybody said that Mr. Weston would never remarry.<eos> Yet I knew from that day with the umbrellas that he would marry Miss Taylor. It is my greatest success!<eos> Success? !<eos> And how do you reckon that?<eos> Success implies endeavour.<eos> Just saying to yourself, "I think it would be a fine thing if Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston were to marry," and then repeating it to yourself every so often is not the same as bringing it about.<eos> Just at the moment when Mr. Weston bought Randalls and was considering how to fill it,<eos> I was there to smooth the way.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Emma was in the process of likening you to some new drapes or a sofa.
Well, he has written to congratulate us and assures us he will be here.<eos> You would think so.<eos> It would be the least he could do for his father.<eos> Then there is the cake to think about. Oh, no, no, no cake, surely not!<eos> Well, yes, Father.<eos> - You would not wish to appear ungenerous.<eos> - Ungenerous?<eos> I am the soul of generosity!<eos> Yes, of course you are, so there must be cake!<eos> No, no cake is bad for you, especially the young.
Well, good day.<eos> Harriet, who was that young man?<eos> Oh, that was my Mr. Martin.<eos> You know, my friend that I spent such a happy summer with.<eos> But I thought the Martins were a middle aged couple with two daughters?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> There is no older Mr. Martin.<eos> Young Mr. Martin runs the farm.<eos> I'm surprised you do not know him.<eos> He often visits Mr. Knightley and I am sure he knows you.
Please?<eos> All right, guys.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Spare me and I'll save you{r lives}.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> No more tricks.<eos> Wife number two just showed up preggers, and I've got to bolt.<eos> {In the store room, }I've got a trap door{. It} leading to a secret tunnel.<eos> It'll take you straight out{ to the Koreo flats}.
You wouldn't know him, unless you're up on the indie scene.<eos> I can't believe you recognize this.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> Well, I should.<eos> I designed it.<eos> Nigel's a dear friend of mine.<eos> He is?<eos> Well, what's he like?<eos> Maybe I can introduce you to him sometime.<eos> Yes, and maybe I might introduce you to my musical friend,
She came in yesterday spouting the same lies you told.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> She's got nothing to do with this.<eos> You Stackhouses.<eos> You're nothing but a bunch of heartless two-faced vampire fuckers.<eos> Don't you ever talk about my sister like that.<eos> And if I find out any of you so much as touched her I'm gonna come back here and it won't be with no fucking paint gun!<eos> Brothers and sisters, we are on lockdown.<eos> Women with children, please take them to our classroom buildings.<eos> Men and able-bodied women security personnel will provide you with stakes and silver just outside the chapel.
It's OK, Grandma.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> No, don't mention it. Where are you going?<eos> I don't know, maybe to the coach station.<eos> There are mass graves, why don't you try there?<eos> Musa, we're going home.<eos> I'll take them to the station, then we'll see.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - God bless you.
It's really impressive, isn't it?<eos> Point being, I want to share my life with you.<eos> My heart, is yours now and forever.<eos> Do with it as you will.<eos> Are you asking me to marry you?<eos> No, you know what?<eos> If marriage is what you want then... Marriage.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Well, Since i met you, i've been orphaned, Kidnapped,<eos> - while part of me despises you...
What?<eos> Funk is the problem, and the solution.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> I have taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out, a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together, to meet, to greet, to see the ones that you love,<eos> to love the ones that you see.<eos> Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?<eos> Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar?<eos> Everybody else is past it. All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.<eos> This is like a haunted coffee house thing?<eos> No, Dwight is confusing you.
Detective Pfifu.<eos> I'm so sorry about your loss.<eos> So, you and your brother had a show?<eos> It was supposed to premiere on Slag TV next week.<eos> - Slag TV?<eos> - It's a cable channel.<eos> - Please have a seat.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Ken and I were just sitting down to discuss all the upcoming episodes when Chief Pope... stopped by.<eos> One of the first things we like to do in... cris response is make certain that the family notification was done properly, so perhaps you can tell us what Chief Pope discussed with you.
Because i knew how it would look.<eos> You knew it'd make you look guilty of jim's murder? No.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's just...<eos> It wasn't just that.<eos> Gaia matrix's stock has been falling for months.<eos> This market has hurt even the best of companies.<eos> The last thing i need issome "page six" sex scandal to make things worse.<eos> So you misled us in order to protect your money.<eos> I misled you to protect the company that jim and i built from the ground up.
Just like clockwork.<eos> Ahh, nothing like driving a hot car with every cop in the city searching for you.<eos> Hopefully, they're not searching too hard.<eos> We can't have paxson showing up now.<eos> You think Tommy's gonna hold up? We'll know soon enough.<eos> That lab's right around the corner.<eos> Cooker's gonna go out for supplies in a bit.<eos> That's gonna be our window.<eos> Me and my guys, we go in the front, take out the alarm.<eos> You three stay outside the door like Tommy told you, okay?
- oh, thanks.<eos> - drama: hey, e!<eos> - this wine is insane.<eos> - it should be. it is not cheap.<eos> - two more bottles, please.<eos> - really?<eos> - yeah, e's buying dinner.<eos> - big spender!<eos> happy birthday, turtle. here we go.<eos> thank you, guys, thank you.
- Man, I want something to eat. - Yeah.<eos> I'm not your waiter.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> - You have the right to an attorney.If you can't afford a lawyer...<eos> - It's, like, amazing.<eos> excuse me for a minute.<eos> Settle someplace, tao!<eos> Now I'm not kidding!<eos> Did you understand what I just told you?
- Y-you talking about that fool?<eos> - Do you recognize him, enrique?<eos> Yeah, the crazy bastard was at the filling station the other night.<eos> He was waving his gun around, shouting some bullshit.<eos> But we left after he started shooting.<eos> Shooting?<eos> At who?<eos> What do you mean, "at who"?<eos> At us.<eos> Now, why would this man fire his gun at you?
-- Just like that.<eos> You know, we knew he was serious.<eos> Tell her, man. Tell her that's the truth.<eos> Sabes que we didn't even get in that car, and that son of a bitch started shooting at us.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> We didn't even get in it.<eos> That's exactly what I thought happened.<eos> Now, if you could just, uh, write it all down, just what you said and, uh, sign it, and we'll be finished.<eos> Write what down?<eos> Just that you wanted to take this man's car, and for no other reason than that, he illegally discharged his weapon at you and that you, uh, fled the scene.
And you're about to be adjusted!<eos> Let that be a lesson, you fiends.<eos> The streets of Old City are no longer safe for your kind.<eos> When crime's around... I'll be found!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - No, no!<eos> What in the hell was that?<eos> Mate, I have no idea.<eos> Here is my favorite part.<eos> You know, I'm so pleased that my pain amuses you.
- Walter...<eos> Come on!<eos> It's my suit. You can't do this to me.<eos> You're gonna die, Walter.<eos> Do you realize that?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Do you realize what this suit has done for me?<eos> My whole life I've been scared to do anything. Not even hobbies.<eos> Do you realize how many people die each year in Renaissance fairy renactments?<eos> The statistics would blow you away.
- Yeah, it's true.<eos> You can get any type you want.<eos> I got bull balls.<eos> They're huge.<eos> Huge.<eos> You know. It's cool. It's a lot of fun.<eos> Occasionally, a cow will lift its tail and all hell'll break lose, but, you know...<eos> What's freezing, guys? 32 degrees, right?<eos> For the love of God!<eos> - So, what brings you fellas over?
That'll take you directly to who has the sword, and that will lead you to MacPherson.<eos> Who Who?<eos> Time's up.<eos> Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time.<eos> Put in for transfers while this whole Warehouse business is still just a sidetrack in your careers.<eos> The scars don't have to be permanent. Yeah, no can do.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do, too.<eos> Now, I may not be your boss anymore, but until someone tells me otherwise, I still outrank you.<eos> So this time I am putting you on a plane with your best friends as an escort.
Sir, I'll have to report you.<eos> Go and report me then!<eos> Sir?<eos> Is she here?<eos> Is she here?<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> What was this room, Mrs Peachment?<eos> It was our air raid shelter.What?<eos> Out here in the middle of nowhere?<eos> The Luftwaffe have a grudge against you or something?
After working for the puppet regime during the war I'm really pretty lucky to have even this.<eos> The report you wrote helped a lot...<eos> I should thank you.<eos> Poor Liu, though...<eos> The Japanese were going to put him in front of a firing squad, but three days before the execution the Japanese surrendered.<eos> He kept his life alright, but he's never been the same.<eos> Anyway, you're not here to hear me complain<eos> Actually I'm here about the dress.<eos> The dress?<eos> The one Gu mended for you.
I'd like to hear it from you.<eos> Sorry if I've come at a bad time...<eos> No, no, sit down.<eos> I was just sorting out the order of service for the funeral.<eos> It's very sad. I really am very sorry.<eos> Found the swine that did it?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No.<eos> Her friend Fawn Granger's gone missing.<eos> I was just wondering if... she might've contacted you.
I was workingin the truck yard.<eos> After a shipment came in, I started hearing these noises coming from this container.<eos> I'm not supposed to openthe containers.<eos> And the noise stopped.<eos> I got worried.<eos> So I went against protocol.<eos> When I looked inside, I found him.<eos> Miles.<eos> And two others.<eos> One of them must've beenhis mother, 'cause... she had that picturethat I gave you in her coat.
All right, release this to the press.<eos> Tell them we're seeking two men in connection with the murder of Maggie Alderton,<eos> Jimmy Cochran and an Arab man in his 40s.<eos> Why do you live this way?<eos> You're Arab boys.<eos> You're Muslim.<eos> Why are you drinking and gambling?<eos> Why don't you work?<eos> Rana, don't go on withWhy don't you mind your own business or you can swim back to the Yemen?<eos> What did your elders teach you in the Zawiya?
- I'm getting real tired of this shit.<eos> - Treat Jess with respect or I'm gonna lock your ass up until Vampire Bill gets home.<eos> Oh, you're Dirty Harry now, huh?<eos> Because you're dipping your penguin dick in that vampire tramp?<eos> You are cut from the same cloth as your daddy.<eos> You are both half-men.<eos> - Miss Fortenberry...<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> A half-man and a dead whore.<eos> - Who else would have either of you?
Hunt has been away for months now and you haven't laid a finger on me.<eos> Well, thank you for noticing.<eos> I am assuming it's because you are good and not because you find me unattractive.<eos> I scarcely think it possible for a man not to be attracted to you, Annie.<eos> However, you are not free to receive my attention.<eos> As we both know.<eos> And your heart belongs to Lizzie, of course.<eos> Is it so terribly obvious?<eos> Not easy, being ignored and abandoned by the one you love, is it?<eos> I hardly think Hunt has abandoned you.
No more. No more!<eos> I will no longer carry messages to a woman you are not worthy of!<eos> Carry messages to a woman who has done everything you have asked of her, yet whom you still reject.<eos> A woman who deserves to be loved.<eos> And if not by you, then by some other man who will not demand of her that she be anything other than her loving and lovable self.<eos> YOU wronged HER.<eos> It is your pride, not hers, that is the issue here.<eos> And she left no word with you of where she might have gone?<eos> To hell, for all I care.<eos> Like I told you last time, she owed four months' rent.
Sir, this is Mr Holman Hunt, the artist, and this is Lord...<eos> Rosterly.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I am a great admirer of your work.<eos> I am a particular devotee of those paintings that depict Miss Miller.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You seem to capture the pain and the pleasure of the fallen woman exquisitely well.<eos> There's no pleasure in a fallen woman that I can see, sir.<eos> Your work tells me otherwise, sir.<eos> What brings you to this establishment, Mr Hunt?
Gabriel.<eos> Come now.<eos> What is a prostitute?<eos> A woman who has made a choice.<eos> What does a seamstress get paid, Lizzie?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was never a seamstress.<eos> Well, a whore can make twice the money and have ten times the enjoyment!<eos> You don't know what you speak, Gabriel.<eos> Perhaps my poem on this very subject will convince you.
When the artist is as great as John Everett Millais, it doesn't become a model to interrupt.<eos> Even when she is freezing to death?<eos> By the time I was freezing to death, I was too cold to talk anyway.<eos> So what appears to be dedication may just have been biology.<eos> No going back now.<eos> What?<eos> What did you say?<eos> No going back now.<eos> Millais has moved on, wouldn't you agree?<eos> Didn't I tell you, Lizzie, the first time I saw you in the hat shop?
So, we're a stool choir now? Nope.<eos> We're not dancing with the stools. No gimmicks.<eos> No false theatricality.<eos> We're just going to sit in them and sing.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Schuester.<eos> This is their set list from sectionals.<eos> "don't stop believing." that's in.<eos> "Proud Mary," Performed in wheelchairs. That's in.<eos> Now, I suggest you take these two songs, Split them between your two groups, And I'll pull some strings<eos> That way, it'll look like he stole the songs From you.
I thought you had Glee practice, my little multitasking star.<eos> I quit.<eos> I'm yours exclusively.<eos> I'll often yell at homeless people...<eos> "Hey, how's that homelessness working out for you?<eos> Give not being homeless a try, huh?"<eos> - Maybe this time in B-flat.<eos> - You know something, Ohio?<eos> It's not easy to break out of your comfort zone.<eos> People will tear you down, tell you you shouldn't have bothered in the first place.
Forget it.<eos> About 90 percent of you simply don't have what it takes.<eos> But for the other 10 percent, let me just say being me is fantastic.<eos> I think her nipples are hard.<eos> As a matter of fact, they are.<eos> My nipples are hard and my lady is wet.<eos> Because success turns me on.<eos> And if success doesn't turn you on then you can take your initial $5000 investment fees pop on out to your shit cars and drive out of here.<eos> Okay then.<eos> So, what turns you on?
Gave it a shove, and, uh, let it roll.<eos> Oh, that's so dangerous.<eos> Is that Cody's bike?<eos> (Rita) Oh, my God.<eos> What if he had been out here playing?<eos> These dummies share the same size and weight distribution as our victim.<eos> At this height, any variant in trajectory resulting from a simple jump or being pushed off the building will be evident in where they land.<eos> (Quinn) What if she took a running leap?<eos> People don't kill themselves that way. They just let go.<eos> Oh, hey, either of you interested in buying tickets to the Dolphins game?
I'll observe his looks, I'll tent him to the quick.<eos> If he but blench, I know my course.<eos> The spirit that I have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape.<eos> Yea, and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy, as he is very potent with such spirits, abuses me to damn me.<eos> I'll have grounds More relative than this.<eos> The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.<eos> And can you, by no drift of conference, get from him why he puts on this confusion?<eos> He does confess he feels himself distracted, but from what cause he will by no means speak.<eos> Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, but, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state.<eos> Did he receive you well?
So think thou wilt no second husband wed, but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.<eos> Nor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light!<eos> Sport and repose lock from me day and night!<eos> Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, if, once a widow, ever I be wife!<eos> If she should break it now!<eos> 'Tis deeply sworn.<eos> Sweet, leave me here awhile.<eos> My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile the tedious day with sleep.<eos> Sleep rock thy brain, and never come mischance between us twain!<eos> Madam, how like you this play?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?<eos> How now, Ophelia!<eos> # How should your true love know # From another one?<eos> # By his cockle hat and staff # And his sandal shoon... #<eos> Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?<eos> Say you?<eos> Nay, pray you, mark.<eos> # He is dead and gone, lady # He is dead and gone # At his head a grass-green turf<eos> # At his heels a stone... # Nay, but, Ophelia...<eos> PRAY YOU, MARK!
Even the good male models make a fraction of what you ladies do<eos> Get against the wall!<eos> Sold your stuff to the wrong girl<eos> A model of your current Stature could use a woman in my position Looking out for his interests.<eos> That offer still good?<eos> There's a boy in your room.<eos> Better me than Dad, right?<eos> Dad's in prison.<eos> Not for long.<eos> Franco put you both on avail for Versace.
Hello, I'm Jill.<eos> On second thoughts, keep your mouth shut.<eos> I'm ringing it.<eos> You need strapping up.<eos> Why didn't you put that bra on?<eos> It is on. It's plopped out.<eos> Sorry about that, Miss McGinnis.<eos> We're from The Gentle Touch Beauty Salon.<eos> This is Jill Gascoigne. I'm Maggie Forbes.<eos> Yes, of course. Hello, ladies, I was expecting you.
I'll tell Dr. Baumschlager you're here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Plastic.<eos> Why do I get the feeling we're gonna sit through a timeshare pitch?<eos> Because there's something a tad dodgy about all of this.<eos> The crash forensics came up zilch.<eos> Right now we have nothing.<eos> None of this makes any sense.<eos> El doctor will see you now.
Nothing personal, Clive.<eos> Who are these people?<eos> What do they think they're running here?<eos> What's the point of funding an invention if you can't stomach the inventor?<eos> Clive...<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> What the bloody hell's the matter with you?<eos> I don't give a shit about components.<eos> Just get it working!<eos> What the bloody hell do you think I pay you for?
Cocky like that.<eos> Very well. Let him make a fool of himself, then these broadcasters will have to come grovelling to me.<eos> How long?<eos> Four days.<eos> Four days?<eos> They want the programme on the air in the new year.<eos> Four days!<eos> Christ!<eos> I know, but I was standing there with my foot in the door - what was I supposed to say?<eos> 'Don't come, because the computer I'm trying to sell you doesn't actually exist.'
Maybe this isn't going to be so bad after all.<eos> Right, names.<eos> Nancy Morrell and Jean...<eos> Joyce...<eos> Fisher.<eos> Joyce Fisher.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Esther and I'm your warden.<eos> Now, take yourselves through.<eos> If Lady Hoxley sees you here, there'll be hell to pay.
Headmaster.<eos> Inspecteur.<eos> Mademoiselle Borderie.<eos> We're delighted to have you here for this great occasion.<eos> Ah yes.<eos> I have something to say to them before we start.<eos> Please. Go ahead.<eos> Children, you are the future of the French nation by writing to the Maréchal it is to France you are writing.<eos> The real France freed of her bad habits of the lies that did her so much harm and the parasites who got rich on her back.<eos> My dear children, the Maréchal hears you.
Your mom will have to.<eos> I'm showing the house.<eos> Shouldn't you make sure you have a place to live?<eos> I'm going back whether Mom likes it or not.<eos> I'm gonna be a daddy.<eos> - And a husband? - Yeah.<eos> Sure, we'll get married again.<eos> - Of course we will. - [Door opens]<eos> Good morning.<eos> Go back to the house. Your mother has to take you.
We need you, and we're sorry And we'll never do it again. We promise!<eos> Words. "I'm sorry,"I promise."<eos> You won't do it again because you're all on probation<eos> And if just one of you screws up, Even a little bit, and I am out of here.<eos> - Is that clear?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Is that clear?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> That's all I had to say.<eos> Excuse me. Did I dismiss you?
He is a traitor.<eos> Tell me, teddy rist, what do you know about betrayal?<eos> Enough.<eos> I know enough.<eos> ±¾×öä"½ö¹©ñ§ï°½"á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾<eos> You know, betrayal...<eos> Betrayal comes in all shapes and sizes.<eos> The treacherous office gossips to backstabbing, both figurative and literal.<eos> At the heart of each betrayal is this.<eos> Someone you know breaks the bond of trust between you.
- Enchanté.<eos> - Enchanté.<eos> I thought you were still in Marseille. No, I'm here.<eos> PR director for the hotel.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, uh, I'm sorry.<eos> This is my husband's partner, Teddy Rist.<eos> - Enchante, mademoiselle. - Monsieur Rist.<eos> What brings you to Paris?
- If she comes here, your father will kill her.<eos> - Leave me!<eos> - You don't have to touch this.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - The baby.<eos> - They killed him.<eos> - Who did it?<eos> - And I was with him.<eos> - When did it happen?<eos> - When they forced you to the convent?
Things have to change here.<eos> - More than this?<eos> - More than this, Ventura.<eos> - And how should I call you?<eos> Angelo o Angela?<eos> - Curator, for everybody here I'm only the Curator, for you and for the others.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - But what did you expect?<eos> - That to erase everybody's mind only needed trousers or a backpack tucked into his pants?<eos> - Don Salvatore, I take you as my son.
- And if Sara were to ask you?<eos> - It's always YOU.<eos> - If she will ask you?<eos> - It's the same thing.<eos> It's alway crazy!<eos> - They deserved it.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - They were two demons.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> D'you want the Baron to hear you?
Everyman victim of an apathetic world.<eos> God, I swear. Someone should write a play.<eos> - Hey, do you write plays?<eos> - Unproduced.<eos> Mr Bigby, it's come to our attention that you recently obtained employment for Mr. Allen as a drug mule.<eos> - You know about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And bad news, Ron ...<eos> You're gonna have to find a new dealer.<eos> - What'd they tell you?
Hey, can you go into the basement and get me a work light?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Got a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm really sorry about what happened to Julie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> I didn't hurt her, Mrs. Delfino.<eos> But you did fight with her.<eos> I mean, Mrs. McCluskey saw you.
I try to be my best.<eos> Good for you.<eos> You're done.<eos> Go be your best.<eos> No one is their best in here.<eos> What is more precious to a human being than their mind?<eos> Everything we feel, see, everything we are is controlled by our brains.<eos> They are the most powerful and delicate part of the human machine.<eos> As some of you know, I lost my mother to Alzheimer's years before she died.<eos> Since I took office, I have made health care and medical research a top priority, and I call you all here today to tell you I am shocked and appalled by what I have found.
- Mr. Francis.<eos> I'm alone.<eos> I hope that's okay.<eos> Oh, well. Actually, my friend couldn't get away either.<eos> - I appreciate your coming up.<eos> - Please. I love coming back here.<eos> - So much changes, so much doesn't.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I'm interested.<eos> Can I help you?
Get him to the chopper. Come on, guys.<eos> Let's go!<eos> All right, this is Matt.<eos> We got an open femur fracture, massive bleeding, a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.<eos> Rockin'.<eos> Congratulations, Matt.<eos> Your first flight.<eos> I have Air Medevac with an arterial bleed and an open fracture.<eos> Trauma bed open at city.<eos> They're prepped and waiting for you.
The early symptoms of ethylene glycol fatigue, nausea, headache.<eos> Indistinguishable from MCS.<eos> Dr. Brennan's gonna want to confer with that Harbinger doctor.<eos> Is that true about the King of the Lab?<eos> That only you care?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I always thought Jenny was alive and happy somewhere.<eos> Some psychic I am.<eos> Look, I don't know if you're psychic or not.<eos> Then why would I send you to the fountain in the first place?
No! SHE SOBS<eos> Please!<eos> God have mercy!<eos> Judge, your Lord, I beseech you!<eos> The sentence is death.<eos> Death by hanging.<eos> Take the prisoner down.<eos> No! No!<eos> JEERING AND SHOUTING<eos> It troubles you not to derive your living from the groans of the gallows?
Broth.<eos> You need food, man.<eos> That, and a stronger constitution.<eos> It is the lot of defence counsel to see their clients carried off to Tyburn.<eos> I was determined mainly to prosecute, far more congenial.<eos> And as for the rights of prisoners, that's a very irregular income.<eos> You will learn that the law is not a game for gentlemen.Will I?<eos> And you shall learn to become a gentleman or there shall be no law for you at all.<eos> Mr Garrow.<eos> Sir Arthur Hill MP invites you to dinner.
Nothing, fraulein.<eos> I have no idea why the blackout lasted as long as it did.<eos> So what, it was all crap- The Kabbalah, the birds?<eos> The crows are real.<eos> They were dying outside my window.<eos> - That must mean something. - Tell us!<eos> I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Please take this. I have no further use for it.<eos> But I believe you will, Herr Benford.<eos> In my vision, I knew that I'd be freed because of what I told you about the crows dying.
A story that she's gonna chase to get the respect she craves. Hmm?<eos> Pack your bags, everyone.<eos> We're going to D.C. to make news.<eos> That's when you want to...<eos> I'm gonna do that bit again.<eos> Pack your bags, everyone.<eos> We're going to D.C. to make news.<eos> She's walking into the closet.<eos> Friends, join me tomorrow... as we hunt for the truth in your own home.<eos> Which of your household appliances is killing you?
You accused them of lying about their sex life, and you're surprised they're upset?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You're buying that happy talk? Really?<eos> - Agent Minelli, sir.<eos> - Agent Lisbon.<eos> I asked him down.<eos> Uh, Walter Crew, Melinda Batson's dad.<eos> You're agents, uh, Jane and Lisbon?<eos> Yeah, we are.<eos> Sorry to track you down like this.
Go!<eos> Keys, please.<eos> There. Yeah.<eos> So, Agent Lisbon, here we are.<eos> What's this about?<eos> This is art cavalleri.<eos> He's the private investigator one of you hired to wiretap and obstruct our investigation.<eos> Really?<eos> He's agreed to talk in exchange for leniency.<eos> I called you down here to offer you the same deal.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Handcuffs. Y'all nasty.<eos> So, when i heard this painting belonged to somebody else,<eos> I was so, uh...<eos> - dismayed?<eos> - So... uh... more, um, shocked.<eos> Shocked, maybe?<eos> Shocked.<eos> Uh, my associates and i just decided we had to return it.<eos> - Oh, god bless you! - That's okay.
I was so, uh...<eos> - dismayed?<eos> - So... uh... more, um, shocked.<eos> Shocked, maybe?<eos> Shocked.<eos> Uh, my associates and i just decided we had to return it.<eos> - Oh, god bless you! - That's okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - God bless you.
No way.<eos> But you have to be great, 'cause he made it clear he's not running a charity.<eos> Thank you so much, Auggie.<eos> I so owe you one.<eos> No, you don't. Just keep your hand out of the register and you'll be fine.<eos> Miss Simms, how was yoga?<eos> Oh, God, just move in already.<eos> Thought you might like to know we talked to Dante Zaretti about your little meeting.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Then I'm sure he explained to you that we were discussing a mutual client.
- Well, perhaps one day you shall.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.<eos> I know everything about you. You are a very impressive young woman.<eos> Why, thank you.<eos> I was just writing copy.<eos> - As you were.<eos> - I hope we chat later.<eos> Mr. Draper is waiting for you in Mr. Cooper's office.
Kang's told me great things about you two.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> so, Where's president lee?<eos> Let's have a drink. ?<eos> He's coming, right?<eos> I'm his representative.<eos> It's as if he's here himself.<eos> Yeah, except he's not.<eos> But it's not a problem.<eos> I mean, I'm - - I'm sure kang has told you how we help people clean up their finances, off-shore bank accounts, shell corporations.
So?<eos> Who's to say that examining every moment is gonna make it any less of a miracle?<eos> The most religious people I know are physicists.<eos> The explination is what makes them believe in a higher power.<eos> This could be the most important day of all of our carreers.<eos> Not only do we have a huge task at hand, but we have to manage and control every bit of information that leaves this building.<eos> Then why all the press?<eos> Because this is history.<eos> It's essential that the public and press witness the landing.<eos> Many of you will be called on for interview, I remind you, keep the subject on Venus.
Yeah, I'm thinking: "I just peed in my pants".<eos> - Memorable.<eos> - Always go with the truth.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'll be back in a couple of hours.<eos> Bring me back one I can see?<eos> I took it off the flight deck.<eos> I figured you need it more down here.<eos> Thanks, Paula.<eos> God bless you.
- Bogus.<eos> Poser.<eos> Asthma.<eos> - He's allergic to rich white people.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> As I was saying, I pay for results. My new chin is proof of that.<eos> Our family needs closure before Warren's will is unsealed this weekend.<eos> Since you are unable to deliver, Rosa, would you put<eos> Mr. Spencer's food in some sort of a bag?<eos> Where shall I have the car drop you off?
Okay. Thanks.<eos> I don't even want to know.<eos> Two bartenders and the manager put Frank's son-in-law Eric and daughter Christina uptown at their friend Eddie's birthday party at Dublin house from 9:15 till after midnight.<eos> Dude, if I have to shave my head, it's going on you.<eos> –What are you doing here?<eos> –What are you doing here?<eos> Lanie called us.<eos> –No, she called us.<eos> –Yeah.<eos> Actually, I called both of you.
- Who's doing a toast?<eos> I would like to go third,sort of back clean up.<eos> Michael,i thought we discussed that we'd rather you not speak, like,at all,because it's just gonna be blood relatives.<eos> That is seriously going to impede my abili to hook up with your female relatives.<eos> Pretty sure everybody heard that.<eos> Didn't move my lips.<eos> Hey,meemaw.<eos> I wasn't sure about your branch of the famil after i heard about your parents divorce.<eos> But you and jim are just perfect.<eos> - God bless you.
He's able to persuade and convince those around him that he should be leader, and he's able to build coalitions.<eos> Zeus now has his siblings by his side, but he still needs more muscle to take on the Titans.<eos> And there are some other estranged members of the family who are out for revenge.<eos> Forgotten brothers of Kronos.<eos> The Cyclops, and the Hundred-Handers.<eos> But to find them Zeus has to go to Hell.<eos> Kronos had feared the powers of these Hundred-handers and the Cyclops so he'd locked them down into Tartarus.<eos> Zeus knew that if he could get their power on his side he could marshal it to his own ends.<eos> He goes down and talks to the Hundred-handers and says,<eos> "I will pay you great respect. "And I know that my father Kronos has mistreated you.
The girl in my dream, she told me soon I would be the last of my kind.<eos> It could be a warning that the line of Confessors is in danger.<eos> I have to go to Valeria, make sure my sister's safe.<eos> Valeria?<eos> That's hundreds of leagues from here.<eos> You can't travel alone.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> I thought there was nothing more important than taking him and this magic rune to Pamorah to find the Stone of Tears.<eos> Zedd, you go on with Cara and Flynn.<eos> We'll catch up with you as soon as we can.
A local tailor found him half-naked in his shop a couple nights ago, stealing clothes.<eos> By the time we got there, he was gone.<eos> Do you have any idea what direction he might be headed?<eos> Well, Black Arrow's Point is only a day's journey.<eos> It's a rich town.<eos> If I were a thief, that's where I'd go.<eos> Mother Confessor?<eos> Yes?<eos> Please excuse my ill-mannered interruption.<eos> I've been searching for you for days.
I hate my life!<eos> Liz, maybe you left your wallet in a friend's car last night.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And maybe i will run into that friend again tonight and then i will get it back from her.<eos> Yes, she will give it back to you when he goes home and gets it from her wife.<eos> What's up with you two?<eos> You've been acting weird all week.<eos> - Weird?<eos> - You left together last night.<eos> And then later, i saw you in front of a comedy club.
Add kids who've never had adult supervision... you do that math.<eos> A lot of pressure on you counselors.<eos> Keep your hands to yourself, Alberto ! I mean now.<eos> I came up Third and Diamond.<eos> I'm used to boys like this.<eos> Alex was killed in his room.<eos> It possible another kid could have done it?<eos> Place like this, doesn't take much to set it off.<eos> Lights out is 9:45.<eos> I catch you out of bed, it's detention.

- I'm trying to.<eos> - Who could be calling you at this...<eos> You are!<eos> I tell you about putting your phone in your back pocket.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> It is me.<eos> It is me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You move, and I paint this wall with your brain matter.<eos> Now, who the hell sent you?
But i don't want to hear a defense attorney say That i let a ninja get away because we didn't look for one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gentlemen, please collect all knives And remove the computers.<eos> If the left-handed mr. price was having an affair, I'd really like the e-mails proving it.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Oh, the man in black?<eos> No, but we're looking very hard.<eos> Mr. price, lieutenant tao may have explained That one of the things we like to do in crisis response Is encourage the families of the victims to speak freely.<eos> You never know what tiny, little detail Might unlock the whole puzzle.<eos> So, you need me to tell you again what i saw. Yes.
What's going on?<eos> Honestly!<eos> Stamping his backside...<eos> Hello.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll give you ration cards.<eos> How long will you stay here?<eos> We've come for the grape harvest.<eos> After, we leave.<eos> A new law forbids you to be nomads, even with passbooks.
A new law forbids you to be nomads, even with passbooks.<eos> We never stay too long in one place.<eos> Our life is the road.<eos> Come, I'll show you something.<eos> "The President of the French Republic decrees<eos> "Article 1 :<eos> "The movement of nomads is banned throughout France<eos> "as long as the war lasts.<eos> "Punishable by a prison sentence of one to five years."<eos> This law forbids you to be nomads.
Goss, eve, Claire... and I believe Rollie.<eos> Yeah, this H.A.L.O. Thing's ball cock.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Any suggestions?<eos> What would be our course of action, Maddux?<eos> That's not very helpful.<eos> Everyone stand.<eos> Take a deep breath and hold it.<eos> You're all stressed. You're all tired, and now I want you to think.<eos> The task at hand is to simply duplicate a sequence of lit pads that's presented to you.
I guess, in Paula's terms.<eos> Maybe we're supposed to embrace our weakness in order to overcome it.<eos> Mintz, science lab.<eos> Apparently Jen has lost it.<eos> That'll keep us in ketchup for a while.<eos> Oh, she cut them down.<eos> The fractals, man, she cut them down.<eos> Why Jen?<eos> There tomato plants do you have any idea how much of our watersupply they were sucking up?<eos> Poets would tell you that science diminishes the beauty of the stars by reducing them to superheated balls of gas.
This is 2.000 Pesos.<eos> May I have it?<eos> We have a contract now, you can leave the rest to us.<eos> Can I go?<eos> - Yes, Lola.<eos> Jay-Jay!<eos> These children are so naughty!<eos> I'll never take you with me again!<eos> Just wait! If I catch you, I'll shave your heads!<eos> Or I call the police, so they'll catch you!
Look, up there, there's a tire.<eos> Come in please.<eos> Mrs counsillor, they are asking for a donation.<eos> They are Sitio llog.<eos> How can we help?<eos> It's about our brother's funeral. We came to ask if you could help us with the cost.<eos> You went to the funeral institute Pinon?<eos> Did you talk to the owner?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And what did he tell you?
She is his mother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you listening to yourself?<eos> She is not his mother.<eos> But she is, Mr. Jordan.<eos> This isn't someone playing make-believe.<eos> In Echo's mind, she planned for this child, carried him for nine months, delivered him and nursed him.<eos> For all intents and purposes, Jack is her baby.<eos> I gave you people money, a lot of money, and you send a crazy kidnapping chick into my house.<eos> - What the hell did I pay you for?
Sir.<eos> So, how're you feeling? Erm, nervous?<eos> Weirded out.<eos> I mean teachers are never this friendly.<eos> You see, diligence has its rewards.<eos> Perhaps now you'll put the same enthusiasm into your other school work.<eos> Mr Chandra?<eos> Park Vale?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr Harding will receive you upstairs.
Blood in the fountain's human.<eos> It doesn't belong to these two.<eos> They're nursing a couple of prizewinning hangovers.<eos> Could you keep your voice down, please?<eos> Looks like the blood came from their clothing.<eos> And judging by the large volume of it in the water...<eos> Somebody is dead.<eos> Gentlemen, how did the blood get in the fountain?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Who cuffed you together?
Thank you.<eos> What?<eos> Smells good. "If fortune is what you seek sincere, The only place to look is... hear."<eos> "Hear"--<eos> It's spelled h-e-a-r.<eos> Well, I assumed it was a mistake.<eos> Hmm. There are no mistakes.<eos> Let's go.<eos> As you know, Walter Beckworth left a coded message Describing the location of his treasure.<eos> I brought you all here to help me find it.
My office did, yes.<eos> Why, exactly, has your office set up its own investigation without getting authorization from FBI Headquarters?<eos> Well, to be perfectly honest, in my flash-forward, I seemed to be-- Or rather, the L.A. office-- Seemed to be at the center of the blackout investigation.<eos> Really?<eos> A-and, uh, how did you determine this?<eos> Here we go.<eos> In my vision, I was running point on something called Mosaic.<eos> I had a case board set up in my office, Covered in clues, pictures, leads-- Everything that you would see in an ongoing, fruitful investigation.<eos> In other words, you're investigating this because you had a vision of investigating this.<eos> Okay. You have a bulletin board with lots of nice pictures on it. But what led you to assume your investigation would actually amount to anything?
So, move, okay?<eos> You make a better door than a guy.<eos> Hey. This is gonna sound weird.<eos> I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.<eos> Yeah, he goes on in a second.<eos> Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's just about that time.<eos> It's with the jazziest pleasure that I bring out for you, my man, Mr. Duke Silver!<eos> Thank you, Dwayne.<eos> As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies.<eos> Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself.
What kind of stuff?<eos> Well, the kind of stuff that needs to get done sometimes.<eos> You know, to take the bad guys down, keep the good guys walking around.<eos> Nothing illegal.<eos> Maybe a little rule bending on the download.<eos> That's no problem.<eos> See, that's my exact point.<eos> There is a problem.<eos> There's no rule bending in the CBI.<eos> You two guys are good agents, but Jane'scorrupted you.
I'll go to bed if you let me touch your boob.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll take Amber home.<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> Amber?<eos> Amber?<eos> Francine!<eos> Agents Page and Plant, fbi.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> What brings you by?
-Of course.<eos> -You better come back for it...<eos> -No, I'll take it now.<eos> What a mighty husband I got!<eos> The door, please.<eos> Let's give granny a kiss, shall we?<eos> -Hurry, she'll start sweating.<eos> -Yes, let's go.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> God bless you, and keep you healthy.
Hey, babe.<eos> Nice to see you too.<eos> Honey?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No!<eos> You expect me to believe you're CDC? - Excuse me?<eos> - Just that you're a day early.<eos> First time I haven't sat on my ass waiting for you people.
May I?<eos> Please.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> For Mr. Muggles and Miss Lovegood, that is.<eos> We met at the groomer.<eos> My little angel wouldn't stop barking until they put her cage right next to his. Am I right, Sandy?<eos> It's true.<eos> Dougie's allergic.<eos> Legume intolerant.<eos> So, how did the two of you meet?
I need to go to the dermatologist. I'm sorry, sir.<eos> But until you get this bedbug situation fixed, they don't want you using your company car.<eos> In fact, they suggested you take... a taxicab.<eos> Oh, why are you scratching?<eos> You have Mugabe's Concubines!<eos> No, bedbugs!<eos> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I'm not a drug addict. I'm an executive with the General Electric Corporation, and I just need to get my medicine.<eos> If someone could tell me how to transfer to the Four train, I would be very grateful to you for your help.<eos> God bless you, and have a good day.
Goodnight.<eos> You have an impressive record.<eos> Straight "A's" in the academy. Thank you, ma'am.<eos> "Agent Harris" is fine.<eos> Did my friend from Major Crimes contact you? Yes, he did.<eos> Thank you, Agent Harris, for that.<eos> Now, tell me...<eos> What happened after you made the buy with Agent Fuller?<eos> After we made the buy from Agent Fuller, uh, Lieutenant Shaw pulled us back from making the arrest.<eos> Did he inform you that Agent Fuller was D.E.A.?
As Odysseus dozes, his crew seizes the chance to find out what's in the mysterious bag.<eos> His men immediately decide "there's gold, there's silver, there's treasures, "and Odysseus doesn't want to share it with us."<eos> They want it for themselves, so curiosity tinged with a bit of greed leads to their undoing.<eos> With the shores of Ithaca in plain sight, they open the bag and the Poseidon curse is unleashed with a vengeance.<eos> In seconds, Odysseus' hopes of getting home are destroyed.<eos> The winds immediately drive his fleet back to Aeolia.<eos> But this time he won't get any help from the King.<eos> Odysseus says to Aeolus, "Can you help us again?"<eos> And Aeolus says, "No. You are clearly cursed by the gods.<eos> "It could not have been easier for you to get home, given what I gave you.
Is there anything else you'd like to say{ to me}?<eos> Please...<eos> I'd like to hear it.<eos> If there's something you want to say to me, don't let me stop you.<eos> You don't have any idea, do you?<eos> - About what?<eos> - How rude and arrogant you can be.<eos> This is my home and you are my guest in it.<eos> {I know y}You are used to more luxurious quarters, but that is not an excuse to be so rude.<eos> {You claim t}Titles don't matter to you, but you behave like a prince and expect me to wait on you like a servant.

Because I killed his son.<eos> Odin's son challenged me to a fight.<eos> I had no quarrel with him.<eos> I asked him to withdraw.<eos> Perhaps he felt he had to prove himself.<eos> I still see his face.<eos> He looked so scared.<eos> You cannot blame yourself.<eos> No-one but us knows where you are.<eos> If the assassin can't find you, he can't kill you.
What?<eos> ! Don't you tell me I don't know about Herbie Hancock.<eos> I love Herbie Hancock.<eos> Me, too. "Rockit."<eos> * Rockit. *<eos> That ain't "Rockit." That's "Axel F."<eos> How does "Rockit" go?<eos> Aw, doggone it. Now you've got me doing it.<eos> You've Herbie Hancock- blocked me.<eos> Kids, I've told you three times now to go make your beds.
So I'll go find him.<eos> - FBI. You Pong Master Bill?<eos> - That's right.<eos> We're here about the threats you made against Steve Rifton on the Internet.<eos> That guy cheated.<eos> I don't believe he played a perfect game.<eos> I want my title back.<eos> Is this how you make a living, repairing vintage arcade games?<eos> It's a skill.<eos> I know why he called you, 'cause he knows what he did was wrong.
We've been going at it for a week... since the decongestant incident where Figgins brought Sue in to co-run the Glee Club.<eos> I'm so ashamed of myself.<eos> She's turned me into her.<eos> Look at me. Even in the heat of battle, I'm so elegant... regal.<eos> I am Ajax, mighty Greek warrior.<eos> God, it feels good to finally pop that zit known as Will Schuester.<eos> Shut up, Sue.<eos> Look at us. We're even fighting in our voice-overs.<eos> I guess things really started to fall apart a couple days ago... right after Figgins called us into his office for a sit-down.<eos> Sue, Schue, I called you here... to get the temperature of the Glee Club.
I think Sue is right about him.<eos> He clearly doesn't like minorities.<eos> Can you imagine in this day and age being discriminated against?<eos> My goodness. The pain you must be feeling.<eos> So your last name's Puckerman, huh?<eos> - Shalom.<eos> - Who knew?<eos> And poor, sweet Brittany.<eos> Oh, I know the Dutch are famous for being a cold people... but that's no excuse for treating you... like some half-price hooker in Amsterdam's famous Red Light District.<eos> Well, all I can say is, if you're serious about leaving Schuester... Sue Sylvester's rainbow tent... will gladly protect you from his storm of racism.
The Captain talked to the friend.<eos> Does she remember who Olivia was with?<eos> Jeff Dilahunt, who's had his fair share of run-ins with the law.<eos> And he has a trust fund worth millions.<eos> Enough to pay $7,000 a month.<eos> - Bingo.<eos> - Boo-yah.<eos> Uh, I met Olivia at a nightclub.<eos> She hadn't been in town long, but, uh, she seemed like a real party girl.<eos> Were the two of you dating?
- Did you ever catch the bad guys?<eos> - No.<eos> It was a joint operation with Russia.<eos> There was a syndicate trying to manipulate the flow of oil from the Black Sea into Europe, and,uh,someone let them know that we were coming.<eos> How come DEA was involved?<eos> Loan out.Taylor and I both spoke fluent Russian.<eos> CIA set it up?<eos> Stanhope was their point person.<eos> But we only ever saw him in the bar the bar,you know,drinking expensive vodka and eating caviar.<eos> Did you ever find who betrayed you?
I'm Jack.<eos> I...<eos> We work together.<eos> Oh, that's cute.<eos> Go.<eos> What are you doing here, Jack?<eos> You okay?<eos> I want to be useful.<eos> I want to be able to look people in the eye and say,<eos> "god loves you, and everything's gonna be fine."
-Hey, you're sure that that compass of yours works?<eos> Yeah, it's the same technology used by Tirolean miners since the fifteenth century.<eos> - Tirolean, huh?<eos> -Yeah. Now I think I know where all that yodeling comes from.<eos> -Help, help!<eos> -Yeah, ok, somebody!<eos> We're stuck down here!<eos> -All right, take it, take it easy. -Whoa.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> We've been following you the whole time.
Yes, dinner would be lovely.<eos> You're very welcome, Mrs...<eos> Please... my name's Leef Apple Glyn.<eos> Leef for short.<eos> This is my husband, Tree Lorn Acre.<eos> I call him Tree.<eos> Sarah Jane.<eos> And this is Clyde, Rani, and my son, Luke.<eos> Pleased to meet you all.<eos> Let us have your teleport coordinates and we'll join you in an hour.
I don't...<eos> Friends indeed!<eos> I do want you to be honest.<eos> So, tell me.<eos> Have I no chance of succeeding?<eos> My dearest Emma... ..for that is what you always have been, and you always will be... My most... beloved Emma.<eos> I cannot make speeches.<eos> If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.<eos> But you know what I am.<eos> I have lectured you and... scolded you... and you have borne it as no other woman would have.
We never even heard those things come aboard.<eos> It killed my crew within minutes.<eos> The sound of their screams still haunt my waking hours.<eos> I close my eyes, I see the horror of a thousand deaths play across the blackness.<eos> Those teeth, those cold insidious eyes that hell sent to drive a man to madness,<eos> Deep Ones, as legend calls them have hankerin' to mate with us, normal folk, for those scaled, webbed hands might tickle a bit.<eos> I dare to even call them soothing.<eos> Then bang! You're an anchovy popsicle.<eos> If you catch my meaning.<eos> Now, you boys start down this road, that's all that's waiting for you, awhole heapin' of fish-rapin'.
And there are dozens more just like her.<eos> Their organs are being harvested in motel bathrooms and makeshift operating rooms.<eos> Young girls who are butchered and dumped on the side of the road!<eos> And you agreed to the oath, doctor.<eos> The covenant.<eos> "l will keep them from harm and injustice."<eos> Do you remember saying those words, huh?<eos> You stupid, greedy son of a bitch.<eos> I've never seen him before.<eos> It's like I told you.
And thus she became the Sexless Innkeeper.<eos> And so are you.<eos> Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?<eos> Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket, which basically says you're not interested in, nor probably even capable of having sex. And she thought, "Hey, free lodging."<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not the Sexless Innkeeper.<eos> Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.<eos> Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service.<eos> Hey, guys. Good news.<eos> First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.
We could talk about your feelings while you walk?<eos> Morgana...<eos> Morgana!<eos> I keep asking myself, why does Uther not pay the ransom?<eos> He's a rich man.<eos> Why would he leave his beloved ward to suffer a slow and terrible death?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Please...<eos> Please!<eos> It must be very upsetting to know that Uther has abandoned you.
YOU KNOW, YOU REALIZE WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN.<eos> WHAT? WE'RE ARGUING.<eos> NO, WE'RE NOT.<eos> YEAH...<eos> NO. YEAH...<eos> NO. YES, WE ARE.<eos> WHATEVER.<eos> AND REMEMBER WHERE WE LEARNED NOT TO DO THAT?<eos> (SIGHS) AT THE THERAPIST.<eos> SO WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY?
Look, I don't care what he thinks about me.<eos> What I do care about is Trinity.<eos> Well, Founder's Day is an opportunity for our alumni to give something back to the college and with Mr Hunter's help, I could really change this place.<eos> Change?<eos> In what way? Every way.<eos> And then apparently, at the end of every Founder's Day, students just get really drunk and throw themselves down Trinity Mound.<eos> It's pathetic! Everyone in college just mucks around and gets drunk.<eos> Looking ravishing as always.<eos> I said you looked nice. What's wrong with that?<eos> Either of you care to enlighten me?
You drink beer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we could get coffee.<eos> Bosh!<eos> I'm in! I knew a black lad back in the village.<eos> Had the most enormous wanger.<eos> He's a plumber now.<eos> So, if we do a prank good enough, we're out of being Fools?<eos> Historically, yes.<eos> A sufficient jest on Founder's Day will release you from your contract.
Idohope to help research also for this type of pathology .<eos> Master, pushplay and go with the base.<eos> . What disease do you have?<eos> . none .<eos> . sorry, your cousin says you're sick .<eos> . I do not know , I'm fine .<eos> . alfredo , look at me.<eos> . Are you crazy too?<eos> ( piped music )<eos> # How much wickedness in this society # # against those who held sessuità another . # # How many people insult you , how many people attacking you # # just because you do not like the fake. #
Iloveyou, you are just beautiful !<eos> Thank you!<eos> He wanted to win him ...<eos> but fuck !<eos> Thank you!<eos> I love all three !<eos> Love !<eos> ( background music )<eos> One at a time , damn it !<eos> Perme is already difficult to make a signature , footers thrown over you .
Like how you know the name of my therapist even though I didn't tell you?<eos> All right, listen, you know where to find me if you ever wanna stop with the bullshit.<eos> (Julianne) Attention!<eos> Attention, River Rockians!<eos> So, you're probably all wondering why I have "summoned" you all here today right in the middle of the day like this...<eos> What's going on?<eos> Julianne called an all-staff.<eos> (Julianne) I have a very special announcement.<eos> Today, one of River Rock's most accomplished authors is celebrating the big four-five.<eos> [light snickering] Every now and then, if you're lucky, you have the privilege of finding a writer who really speaks to you.
Who is she?<eos> I believe her to be...<eos> She's, she's...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> She is a troll, Sire.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Some trolls have the power to take any shape they please.<eos> This one has taken a shape that pleases you.<eos> You are besotted, my lord.<eos> The creature has you in its power.
I tried! It's not that easy.<eos> Okay, relax.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Can Brick come out and play?<eos> Look, Olivia, Brick asked me to speak to you because he thinks you're a very nice girl, but he's not ready to get married.<eos> But he wants to remain friends because he likes you very much.<eos> It's too late. We're already married and we have kids.<eos> What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.<eos> Okay. How about this? You're not really married, and your kids are dolls.<eos> So why don't you head home, and Brick will see you around school, okay, hon?
Blast it!<eos> Senator Amidala.<eos> An unexpected privilege.<eos> Senator Dod, please forgive me for arriving unannounced.<eos> Oh, no, always a pleasure to see you, my dear.<eos> - I hope you and I can make a fresh start.<eos> - I came here with the very same hope.<eos> - I believe in second chances.<eos> - So do I, Senator. So do I.<eos> My servants will see you to your room.
You want me to stall them?<eos> It's best just to cut him loose.<eos> He's denying everything anyway.<eos> Unless we can make a connection to Culpepper or Doyle, we've got nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> You go and ask Culpepper about Tom. I'll deal with the family.<eos> You can take Tom home now.<eos> We just had a couple questions we needed to ask him.<eos> - What questions?<eos> - I'm sure he'll fill you in on the details.
- You want to help her?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Or she's dead.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Let's go. Go. Go, go, go.<eos> We lose her, man, she dies.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Medic 78 to control.<eos> Medic 78, SFPD is on their way to you.
Get on your knees.<eos> (cheering) Yes!<eos> You just lost.<eos> BRASS: So did you.<eos> How's it feel to be ratted out by your own bowling ball?<eos> What the hell am I still doing here?<eos> I've told you everything I know.<eos> No, you didn't, but Chevy did.<eos> Sit.<eos> What did he tell you?
- Meg.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - You were hunting with Jo?<eos> - Yeah, for a while now.<eos> The mooks have melted down the gun by now.<eos> Well, I hear differently.<eos> And if you are still set on the insane task of killing the devil, this is how we do it.<eos> In chapter 33 of "supernatural," there was that girl, Bela. She stole the colt from you, and then she "said" she gave it to Lilith, remember? - Yeah.
And I promise you that I won't with you. All right, Troy?<eos> I will do everything I can to get you the best deal, the best endorsements...<eos> I know, but...<eos> What's going on, Troy?<eos> Ken Arthur called my dad two days ago. He said they fired you.<eos> I'm Dan Scott, and I've shown people how to rebuild their lives through the power of forgiveness.<eos> But what about me?<eos> Can I be forgiven?<eos> Tune in tomorrow for a special edition of Scott Free Redemption.<eos> And remember, the truth will set you free.
It's the most wonderful time of the year<eos> I love Thanksgiving.<eos> It's The Cleveland Thanksgiving.<eos> Brought to you by Cascade.
All right, I can just kiss my promotion good-bye.<eos> Wow. This feels good.<eos> Guess you won't mind driving, then, right?<eos> Hey. Why am I always going to bed when everyone else is waking up?<eos> Well, at least this time you're not alone.<eos> - I'm right here with you.<eos> - Thanks. It's like when we were kids, we used to stay up all night - and sneak downstairs and watch TV.<eos> - Oh, yeah, we'd lie to Mom, right?<eos> And then what'd she say?<eos> Oh, "Only the truth will set you free."
And the last I checked, the New York tabloids could give a rat's ass about your diplomatic status.<eos> They'll just print your photograph with a headline that says, "Diplomatic Douchebag."<eos> Fine.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> There's a fake version of this painting found in one of our shooting victims' apartments. - Can you tell us how it got there?<eos> - How would I know this?<eos> Because the fake painting is where the real painting used to be. And now you have the real painting.<eos> All I know is I that I asked Fink to acquire it for client of mine.<eos> When he said he had it, I assumed he tracked down the owner and made a deal. But when I went to the gallery that evening, he sent me away.<eos> - Just like I told you.
Arthur carries a heavy burden.<eos> It can't be easy holding all that responsibility at such a tender age.<eos> I'm afraid that's the way it has to be.<eos> After all, I cannot rule Camelot alone.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You married me, remember?<eos> UTHER GASPS IN PAIN How could I forget?<eos> I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> I'm too worried about you.<eos> With Arthur letting you down the way he has. How will you cope?
LADY CATRINA'S VOICE: Now, would you care to accompany your Queen?<eos> Come in.<eos> I saw what you did earlier.<eos> The people owe you a debt of gratitude.<eos> The people owe me nothing.<eos> My father is still going to impose the tax.<eos> Will he not be persuaded?<eos> Not by me.<eos> He can't stand the sight of me. That's not true.<eos> The King loves you.
The cutting of cloth?<eos> Felony.<eos> What has this to do with the monster?<eos> Our monster does not murder.<eos> And common assault, even with intent to maim or kill, is a misdemeanour.<eos> But this, this cutting of cloth, is a felony - punishable by hanging.<eos> If a bad law will becalm London, we must have it.<eos> I hear there are calls for a permanent police patrol in light of the monster?<eos> That would be very expensive for the Treasury.<eos> The Home Secretary will be most grateful to you.
Certainly.<eos> The wound, it heals now?<eos> Thankfully so.<eos> And... anatomically... the thigh or...higher up?<eos> Higher up, sir.<eos> Higher up.<eos> You bear it most courageously.<eos> I asked you not venture out unaccompanied.<eos> I had no wish to have Mrs Browning as my companion.<eos> You wish a monster keep you company?
No other attorney has wish to represent the Monster.<eos> He is not the Monster.<eos> He has alibis for each occasion?<eos> He is not the Monster because he is my son.<eos> A mother knows what her son may be capable of and while Renwick may be many things, sir, he...<eos> What kind of things?<eos> I did read that 22 women were called to the magistrates in total.<eos> Half of them claiming Renwick bore a resemblance to their attacker but not able to swear to it.<eos> And the other half unable to do either, sir.<eos> So, pray, what would that tell you?
How so?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Will you answer the question, Miss Porter?<eos> Precisely what the insult was.<eos> "Blast your eyes, you damned bitch.<eos> "I will take a particular pleasure in murdering you<eos> "and drowning you in your own blood."<eos> It is very familiar.<eos> I put it to you, Miss Porter, that on that occasion, Mr Williams did insult you most scandalously and indecently but there was never another one.
It's one of your strengths.<eos> And one of your weaknesses is duelling.<eos> Yes.<eos> Here is a brief that may be of interest.I am not fit for court.<eos> Hmmm... Forrester the thief-taker is the main witness.I accept the brief.<eos> I had thought you would.<eos> Well?<eos> No-one can help us.<eos> I know how thief-takers conduct their business.<eos> Forrester orders you to rob, he then pays you for the stolen goods, then sells the goods back to the owner.
It is.Well, then it is fortunate that the law states that selling goods worth less than 29 shillings is not a hanging offence.<eos> Plead not guilty to the crime as charged.<eos> Tell them what you did and why.<eos> If the jury hate the thief-taker enough and I can expose him as a liar, then there is a chance you may cheat the rope.<eos> What say you?<eos> Ah, Garrow, how heals your graze?<eos> Silvester, I have heard of cases where the life and death dance of the duel often leads to new respect, even affection or deep friendship.<eos> Apparently this is so.<eos> This is not one of those cases.<eos> The way you shot at me marks you as a loathsome cad.
Perjury will be dealt with most severely, Mr Steele.<eos> Most severely!<eos> I ask again, how do you earn your living, sir?<eos> I did not intend to mislead.<eos> I am a tanner by trade.<eos> I earn my living working for Mr Forrester.<eos> Do not look to Mr Forrester, he must know he employs you.<eos> What do you do? All sorts.<eos> Anything I'm put to.<eos> I saw you in court last week.

it's got 3 rows of seats, too.<eos> So we can carpool with my whole soccer team.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> come on in.<eos> I know how much you loved that old car, But i just remember it took you about a year to pick it,<eos> So, i hope you don't mind if we -- Mind?<eos> why would i mind?<eos> And i love you.<eos> Both of you.
Yeah.<eos> You went home with a medical discharge.<eos> Report's buried, end of career.<eos> And that's the way it was over there.<eos> You always paid for what you didn't do.<eos> I'm not much for swapping war stories.<eos> Well, here's your service photo. Here's a composite sketch of the suspect from a 1971 hijacking.<eos> The money we found in Wesley's wall is from that hijacking.<eos> We knew that he was using his job to launder it.<eos> The Army screwed you. A million dollars, that's a lot of payback.
Hello to you and thanks for joining.<eos> This is exciting, isn't it? Eh?<eos> Now, let me get you up to speed.
Hello?<eos> Abby? We're in here.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hi.<eos> Wow, this place is seriously cool.<eos> So, how do you...?<eos> Double tap, get the menu, fill the screen.<eos> It's all very intuitive.<eos> No wonder mcgee can't stop talking about this.<eos> So, I'm sure leon has told you that I know who killed mcellon.
Yeah, I remember the police asking about it.<eos> Well, delores, Anything you could tell us, we'd appreciate it.<eos> Kind eyes, this one.<eos> I like him.<eos> Delores, are you hitting on me?<eos> Because I am shocked... At your excellent taste in men.<eos> Wanna buy me dinner?<eos> When?<eos> Whenever you want.<eos> If I help you, You come back and buy me dinner.
- I'm just ignoring you.<eos> - I'm just ignoring you.<eos> I'm just ignoring you.<eos> - Wait, what are you doing?<eos> - Wait, what are you doing?<eos> - Brick, knock it off. That's lame.<eos> - Brick, knock it off. That's lame.<eos> - It doesn't work that way.<eos> Quit it! - It doesn't work that way. Quit it!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
It's too soon to tell, Eric.<eos> Valera.<eos> I am running the biologicals from Dr. Loman. About to get you a DNA profile.<eos> Let's run it against the criminal database.<eos> I'll check registered sex offenders.<eos> No match in our system. I'll need someone to compare it to.<eos> No worries. I've got an idea.<eos> You have no right to take biologicals from my client.<eos> We have a right to test whether the semen found on the victim belongs to Finley.<eos> Is there some new evidence that leads you to believe that Ms. Davenport was raped?
It's pee!<eos> Look out for the pee!<eos> Ah! Gross!<eos> It's a-the pee!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They killed Kenny!<eos> Aw, sick!<eos> I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I told you people to keep civilians back!
William!<eos> The duel, it was over Lady Sarah.<eos> Damn you!<eos> Runners!<eos> You bitch!<eos> Am I a cuckold?<eos> No, sir, you are not.<eos> The way you shot at me marks you as a loathsome cad.
Thank you, Mr Silvester.<eos> All records of the proceedings to be struck.<eos> None to be reproduced whatsoever, that includes you, Mr Rawlings.<eos> The Crown versus Wagstaffe is dismissed.<eos> The accused is free to go.<eos> Am I to take this as fraud Mr Southouse?<eos> Or will your genius Mr Garrow stand up to his self-proclaimed reputation?<eos> Madam, I cannot speak for Mr Garrow.<eos> We have, quite recently parted our...<eos> This bill states you as his procurer.
Yes, I heard today from my wife.<eos> Sarah carries my child.<eos> William!<eos> Did you think I would despise you?<eos> Did you think that if you told me why my feelings for you could not be returned that I would in some way think less of you, and instead thought it better to let me torment myself with all manner of speculation?<eos> You are determined to tell me what I thought and think.<eos> I wonder - am I necessary to this conversation? Or will you play both parts?<eos> A child?<eos> I must confess that this news, brought to me by your husband, gave me an idea of your marriage other than you led me to believe.<eos> Forgive me if... I led you to any false understanding.
A child?<eos> I must confess that this news, brought to me by your husband, gave me an idea of your marriage other than you led me to believe.<eos> Forgive me if... I led you to any false understanding.<eos> Leave him.<eos> SHE SCOFFS We are of common mind about this world and although I cannot offer all a man of his position can, we will be well together, we...<eos> we will begin anew.<eos> This is a madness!<eos> Is it?<eos> Tell me you that you cannot imagine a life other than the one you have.<eos> With a man who sees you, and accepts you and... will love you for all that you are.
We will call witnesses, Mr Lynam among them.<eos> We'll say again and again that armed uprising was never in his mind.<eos> Tell the court, Mr Oakes, when you met the prisoner Joseph Hamer on that day, it was to complete a transaction.<eos> A sale of goods.<eos> Tell us... what goods?<eos> A sale of muskets, sir.<eos> A hundred muskets.<eos> All of this is lies!<eos> No more questions.<eos> Mr Oakes, did Mr Hamer's wife or any of his friends ever meet you over the course of your supposed business with him?
It's just all an act!<eos> We need the ring to get you home.<eos> The looking glass won't work without it.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Don't be fooled by this, Alice.<eos> He's working for his mother.<eos> Blood and water, you remember?<eos> Then why am I alone?<eos> Why aren't there 500 suits at my back?<eos> And how did I find you here in the middle of the forest?
It's me, Alice. It's your father.<eos> [Voice breaks]:<eos> You don't remember me. You don't remember anything.<eos> I do.<eos> I-- thanks to you... I remember everything.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> This is just another trick.<eos> You see this guy?<eos> He's the one who brought you here!<eos> He hooked you up! And when he's done with you, when he's done with you, he'll get rid of you. Isn't that right?
What could I do?<eos> Morgana, I don't understand.<eos> Why is it that you're the only person awake?<eos> Don't worry, I won't say anything. About what?<eos> The illness.<eos> That has nothing to do with me.<eos> Of course not, but you have magic.<eos> You haven't told anyone that?<eos> No. And I won't tell Arthur, but...<eos> There must be something keeping you safe.
Not carrying Uther.<eos> That's why we've made this.<eos> We're going to pull him.<eos> Get down and keep quiet.<eos> Protect the King, get him out of here!<eos> Merlin!<eos> Please!<eos> Merlin, help me.<eos> Morgana.<eos> We need the remedy that Gaius gave you.
I said you can go!<eos> ..My lady.<eos> Morgana!<eos> It is my hope, that with time,<eos> Mordred will master the crystal.<eos> And when he does, we will strike Uther down -<eos> Uther and all who serve him.<eos> ALL who serve him?<eos> If we are to win this war, there can be no half measures.<eos> I can see this troubles you.Yes.
You'll be wasting your time, I assure you.<eos> Morgana, I never knew you cared(!<eos> ) What are you talking about?<eos> I can look after myself, you know.<eos> It's the combination of raw talent and hard training that makes me...<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> That makes you so utterly obnoxious.<eos> Gaius had better be right about this.<eos> Morgana?<eos> Alvarr. What brings you here?
Why are you defending this man?<eos> He was a sworn foe of Camelot. You know this.<eos> Is it any wonder he wanted you dead?<eos> You who have persecuted his kind, day after day, year after year.<eos> I will hear no more of this, Morgana.<eos> Because you are an arrogant fool!<eos> You are deaf and blind to the needs of the people you profess to serve and protect. The people will tolerate it no longer.<eos> I said "enough"!<eos> They are rising up against you.<eos> From this day forward, I do not know you.

- It is.<eos> It is, but you can't do it.<eos> Killing Peter Mandelson is a grey area, but doing 70mph on the motorway is an absolute.<eos> How many people went on the anti-war march?<eos> A million, we went to war.<eos> How many people went on the countryside march?<eos> 400,000, and fox-hunting was still banned.<eos> The Government is not interested in the will of the people.<eos> Particularly if it is just one pedantic long-haired old Queen standing up in the court saying, I did 70 because it's logical.<eos> Speed limits in motorway can be a pain, and theres two solutions outlined for you.
But because of the blinding, they've escaped and so they're no longer being fed on the farm.<eos> They've started...<eos> They've started to, um...<eos> We know that they have started to attack and eat people.<eos> They have a fatal sting capable of reaching up to 15ft.<eos> And they make a distinctive rustling tick-tocking kind of noise.<eos> So if you hear or see one, you must keep your distance.<eos> Where do you think that the triffids are heading?<eos> They'll gravitate towards the cities, to where the most abundant source of food is... ..us.<eos> So, if you are sighted, then arm yourselves and do what you can to protect those around you, especially the blind, and... ..tell anyone that you can.
The triffids aren't our priority.<eos> Yeah, well, they should be. We've seen what they can do and so has he.<eos> What matters now is organization.<eos> What's your role in all of this?<eos> My role?<eos> I thought you said you were on your own.<eos> Then I met Major Coker.<eos> His plan to take over London interests me.<eos> Sorry, Jo. All right.<eos> Guides will take you to your sections.
Then I met Major Coker.<eos> His plan to take over London interests me.<eos> Sorry, Jo. All right.<eos> Guides will take you to your sections.<eos> Let's load up, guys.<eos> Look after Hilda for me, Joe!<eos> We got to load the trucks.<eos> Double time, everybody.<eos> Torrence, come on, help out.<eos> Guides will lead you to your sections.
And they tried to send my ass to rehab, and I went, yeah yeah yeah.<eos> And I went to rehab in wine country just to keep my options open.<eos> And while I was in rehab I read an article in The Inquirer about my being drunk.<eos> It was like, that poor fuck. Oh, fuck, that's me.<eos> And the weird thing too about when you read articles in The Inquirer or TMZ and you're looking at all these assholes going, those poor motherfuckers.<eos> And only the Germans could come up with the word for that...<eos> Feeling pleasure at other people's misfortune.<eos> It's called schadenfreude.<eos> And only the Germans could go, we found the fucking word for that.<eos> God bless you.
The father goes,<eos> I'll go talk to Timmy.<eos> He goes to Timmy's room.<eos> He opens the door.<eos> And little Timmy is giving it hot and heavy to grandma.<eos> The father goes, oh my God.<eos> And little Timmy says, not so funny when it's your mother, is it?<eos> Good night!<eos> Thank you, DC.!<eos> God bless you!

The peeps in the top! Thank you!<eos> May we have health care!<eos> God bless you!
Does it hurt?<eos> If by "it" you mean my entire body, then yes.<eos> Did Jenny see anything?<eos> She never saw the partner.<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> They found a truck ditched a few miles from the accident.<eos> Plates were missing, but the front end definitely hit your car.<eos> OK, so the partner saw everything in the woods, he ran away and stole a truck?<eos> Who is this guy? He knew you were taking that road back to the station.<eos> He waited for you and he crashed into you.
Go home and rest.<eos> I just choked on the smoke.<eos> Don't think too much of it.<eos> What if the fire was more severe?<eos> What if you weren't only choked by the smoke?<eos> What if the fire department had not come in time?<eos> Then I would have lost you.<eos> My most precious Yang Yang<eos> I had mixed feeling when I knew what happened.<eos> I am worried that you girls would be scared, but I know that God, in His power, will show His grace and keep you safe.
He is.<eos> Does he know about you?<eos> No. I mean, i don't believe so, anyway.<eos> Wow.<eos> I-I mean, i' been trying to figure out a way to talk to him, But i find him rather intimidating, to say the least.<eos> I tried to speak to him at your art show, But i just couldn't bring myself.<eos> You know, what if he rejects me?<eos> Jamie, i know darryl, and he may be a lot of things, But i don't think he would reject his own son.<eos> Well, still, I-I just don't think i can take the risk.<eos> Okay, well, how about this-- How about if i get you two to dinner at my house?
Like Femme Fresh,<eos> Because it's a very strong smell in it's own right, but it suggests that there are other things masking,<eos> You get notes, don't you?<eos> You get notes, undercurrents, Suggestions of...<eos> I can smell the fruity stuff, but also a bit of stale wee,<eos> Sick?<eos> I can get a really beery burp,<eos> All the things you'd expect in a minicab,<eos> I have another gift suggestion here for Christmas,<eos> Are you fed up with people bumping into you in a crowd situation?
You're not the nervous sort, are you?<eos> Some girls are.<eos> That's not you, is it?<eos> No.<eos> No, sir, it's not.<eos> Because the post of Governess, so many have left it before they even start it.<eos> The last girl, the pretty one I chose, Miss Jessel, I favoured her and she let me down.<eos> She left without even a week's notice.<eos> If I trust you with this job, you must promise, promise, never to disturb me, never to worry me, about anything.<eos> I would never let you down, sir.
Are you hurt? There, over there at the window.<eos> What?<eos> There was a man at the window.<eos> He had blood on his face.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> There was a man at the window.<eos> You are mistaken.<eos> I've told you this is a respectable house, no-one from the village would come here.<eos> (Do you think she saw...) Children.<eos> You say he was staring straight at you?
I don't think they will have you back.<eos> You're lying!<eos> QUINT: You're a lying bitch!<eos> Your hands are shaking.<eos> Are you frightened?<eos> You know why, don't you?<eos> I know I'm not your mother, but I will always love you.<eos> And I will always be here if you want to come home.<eos> You're very sweet.<eos> I love you too.
You're absolutely right!<eos> It's only begun...<eos> The war has only just begun.<eos> More...<eos> Become even more magnificent!<eos> If you don't... I'll be deeply... troubled.<eos> You will not be forgiven... 300)}You will not be saved!<eos> Shoot!<eos> 400)}Bastards!<eos> Now... all of you just hurry up and die!
Are there any old people at the school who lived the first Nakba?<eos> Yes, many.<eos> What do they think about being forced to evacuate for the second time?<eos> Does it bring back memories? Yes, for sure.<eos> At the school we speak about it.<eos> They used to tell us about it and now we are living it.<eos> But this Nakba is much harder than the first one.<eos> In the first Nakba they were not destroying the people this way.<eos> Now shells are falling on people's heads.<eos> May Allah provide you with patience.
People also call it the National Security Administration.<eos> How shall I put it?<eos> Homeland peace?<eos> Let's just say it's an organization that defeats enemy threats to our country.<eos> It's no different from the Special Forces you've been a part of.<eos> Only, the existence of the NSS is unknown to the world.<eos> Why are you doing this to us?<eos> Your pain during a brief time was probably quite extreme.<eos> Think of that as a rite of passage into becoming NSS agents.<eos> The state has chosen you, but you have a right to refuse.
This place is like downtown Seoul.<eos> Why don't you relax the tense eyes?<eos> I'm NSS Anti-terrorism Chief Park Sang Hyun.<eos> First off, welcome to the NSS.<eos> Go ahead and introduce yourself.<eos> - I'm Hwang Tae Sang.<eos> - I'm Yang Mi Jung.<eos> Yang Mi Jung is one of Korea's top-rate hackers.<eos> She'll help you with computer related work.<eos> Hwang Tae Sung will provide support for you back at headquarters during your missions.
Aren't you dead?<eos> I'm back from the dead<eos> After that,Jaejun became a real postman.<eos> And I become an illustrator.<eos> I thought that it would be great to have someone write a letter on the post card I drew.<eos> I quarreled with Jaejun sometimes Because he wants to read the letters in the postcard<eos> And the story is over...<eos> If,<eos> If...<eos> If someone who you don't know asks you,
I understand that to be true.<eos> When the new administration came into office, they wanted to win the favor of the US Government, so they voluntarily gave up the development of nuclear weapons.<eos> Is that true?<eos> I understand that to be true.<eos> Where is it?<eos> The information to build nuclear arms to completion.<eos> The program to develop them may have been abandoned, but the knowledge couldn't have disappeared.<eos> That was not my area of responsibility, so I do not know.<eos> Sunbae-nim!<eos> The Section Chief is looking for you.
What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> Chinese whores are more expensive than her<eos> It's time to fuck the cheapest Korean whore<eos> Why don't you fuck her?<eos> You can cover her fucking face with a towel<eos> Let's have threesome!<eos> What the fuck is your fucking problem?<eos> We want threesome Three, threesome!<eos> Go to your fucking home<eos> I told you to fuck off
What a fibber!<eos> You should have taken the van!<eos> Why ride this?<eos> And leader, why are you dressed like that?<eos> This is Manager Ma's car and Hyung-nim's clothes were ruined.<eos> Where can I wash his clothes?<eos> We're staying at big Hyung-nim's house so go over there.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> How annoying!<eos> Nobody recognized you.
Slowly tell me how this came about next time.<eos> Whatever the case, Go Mi Nam, my being a good Hyung to you has now ended.<eos> From now on, let's start afresh.<eos> Hyung, open up!<eos> Kang Shin Woo!<eos> As you can see, Go Mi Nam is a girl.<eos> I already knew this long ago.<eos> I'm sorry for not telling you two.<eos> If you cannot accept this, speak up now.<eos> I won't drag you two into this.
The liar mountain.<eos> Oppa.<eos> I don't know what is going on.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I've realized that you're behind this.<eos> Is that so?<eos> You know all about it?<eos> Do they know everything as well?<eos> I thought that it was unlikely but everyone really remained understand and was alright with that.<eos> Just because everyone calls you angels, you think you are really angels?
Oppa, you usually don't show interest in or care about other people.<eos> How can you be so sure that Eun Sung didn't recognize you?<eos> You know I'm not a complicated person?<eos> I'll just say this simply, and don't take this personally.<eos> Talk.<eos> I don't believe everything is true.<eos> I've spent a lot of time with her.<eos> No matter how innocent I am, and even if I'm not interested in the affairs of others,<eos> I'm not a rock with no intuition or perception.<eos> I don't think she would go to the extent of threatening you.

Never see me again in this lifetime?<eos> Sever ties?<eos> Are parents really parents only when they give their children money?<eos> Snubbing parents who don't own a fortune, severing ties with the parents, so that's referring to our family!<eos> If I was someone with no capabilities at all, you people would just bury me?<eos> Mother!<eos> I really didn't think of that!<eos> Me neither, Grandmother!<eos> Yes.<eos> Not leaving anything to you, and giving everything to someone else.
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?<eos> You've moved up in the world.<eos> Look at you, Lieutenant First Class.<eos> And with your record of insubordination.<eos> Truly remarkable.<eos> And that one's name is Wilhelm Wicki.<eos> He's an Austrian-born Jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites.<eos> They are the two German-born members of the Basterds.<eos> They've been known to don German uniforms, to ambush squads.<eos> What brings you all the way out here?
But stay alert outside.<eos> So you're Aldo the Apache.<eos> So you're The Jew Hunter.<eos> I'm a detective.<eos> A damn good detective.<eos> Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.<eos> And, yes, some of them were Jews.<eos> J ust a name that stuck.<eos> Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.<eos> Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
Carol!<eos> The fort looks great!<eos> Yeah, thanks, we were all working really hard on it.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> K.W. took me to see her friends Bob and Terry.<eos> They really wanna meet you.<eos> They may even stay over.<eos> Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?<eos> What?<eos> K.W. told you about me?
Can you guess who that teacher might be?<eos> You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.<eos> And he will not give it up easily.<eos> You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.<eos> I did.<eos> Do you want me to let him?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right. Um... This morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills just to assess your strengths.
Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?<eos> It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.<eos> - Or 20.<eos> - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.<eos> Honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.<eos> She could never annoy me.<eos> I think I love her.<eos> Well, brilliant.<eos> Do you think she knows I exist?<eos> I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.
But that was not enough to stop her from eventually making a choice... to leave this place... and all the suffering and me... behind.<eos> Great.<eos> Forgot about Vassily.<eos> My life in a nutshell.<eos> Just once...<eos> Just once I'd like to keep the perfect sleep.<eos> You know the one I'm talking about.<eos> You fall asleep on a train or someone's couch or in a hospital... and it's perfect.<eos> The ecstasy of the unlikely.<eos> And then some bastard wakes you up, and you can't get it back no matter how hard you try.
We only got enough for ourselves.<eos> You point that gun at somebody, you better be ready to pull the trigger.<eos> Put your guns down, everyone.<eos> Look, we just came to find the Resistance, that's all.<eos> The Resistance?<eos> What a joke.<eos> Fighting those machines is impossible.<eos> We keep our heads down, they ignore us.<eos> They'll come for you eventually.<eos> We help you, maybe they will.
I once knew a woman who told people to fear the future that the end was coming, that all would be lost.<eos> Nobody wanted to hear her truths.<eos> Society locked her away.<eos> That woman was Sarah Connor, my mother.<eos> Now we know that what she predicted has all come to pass.<eos> Command wants us to fight like machines.<eos> They want us to make cold, calculated decisions.<eos> But we are not machines!<eos> And if we behave like them, then what is the point in winning?<eos> Command is going to ask you to attack Skynet.
I see you have an eye for a bargain.<eos> The paper might be old, but it can still be put to use.<eos> Come!<eos> It works!<eos> It works!<eos> Do you still think it was a sin to accept Johanna to the Schola?<eos> You should take this girl as a model!<eos> Her work is perfect.<eos> Seven years later<eos> What is troubling you?
What does your husband say about the matter?<eos> He does not know.<eos> Gerold's feeling clouds his judgment.<eos> Once Johanna married, she will no longer be allowed to attend the Schola.<eos> That is why I'm here to ask your consent.<eos> For many years, she has been fed and clothed by my family.<eos> How long must we provide such charity?<eos> The blacksmith's son is a good match.<eos> He is blunt and illiterate.<eos> May I remind you that Johanna was put in my custody.
Your boat got tangled in the weed along the shore. - You were half mad with fever.<eos> - So you saved my life.<eos> And I thank God for giving me the chance to repay you for what you did for me and my family.<eos> Arn?<eos> Pardon me, but... But how should I address you? Now... now that we know what we know.<eos> Johanna.<eos> My name is Johanna.<eos> Johanna!<eos> This is my wife, Bona. And this is our daughter, Arnalda.<eos> God bless the three of you.
But that is far too dangerous!<eos> Not if I travel with other pilgrims, disguised as a man.<eos> We thought perhaps you would stay with us.<eos> As you can see there's always work to be done. And here you would always be safe.<eos> I appreciate your kindness, but...<eos> I have lived so long as a man, and I'm afraid I would not be of much help to you. - But...<eos> - Let her!<eos> She is meant for a different path, and we have no right to divert her from it.<eos> I will miss you terribly.<eos> A gift from the count, and if you do not take it, I'm going to send you back to the monastery.
Would you care to tell us what you can read in it?<eos> It's a miracle!<eos> Our Holy Father will give birth to a child.<eos> Enodius! You gave him a pregnant woman's urine?<eos> I had to be sure that Pope is not falling into the hands of a charlatan.<eos> He is a charlatan. Just like all the others.<eos> I don't trust them.<eos> I'm Anastasius, Papal Nomenclator.<eos> I sent for you to hear your opinion on the Pope's condition.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> Soon after Enodius was expelled from the Palace, and Sergius made Johanna his personal physician. He included her in political decisions as well.<eos> Over the next few years, Johanna became one of the Pope's most trusted confidants.<eos> Nicephorus would make a good bishop, Holiness.<eos> Yes?<eos> He is not Roman, so many will be opposed to his appointment, but he is a man of God and will remain true to you.<eos> So it will be.<eos> Today I shall...<eos> Holy Father!<eos> The Bishops need to see you urgently.
Count Ferenc Nadasky was a good husband and father.<eos> But above all, a great warrior.<eos> Today he's standing joyfully with Jesus at the right hand of God<eos> Soon we will be with him at their side for eternity.<eos> I'll send the soldiers back to war.<eos> You will manage Cachtice while I'm gone.<eos> I must bring the children to a safer place And show the Court Ferenc's death has not weakened me<eos> - Are we ever coming back, Mother?<eos> - Of course, but for now you will stay in Vienna.<eos> You will learn music, French and Latin with the best teachers. And aunt Klara will take you to see plays and fireworks.
We had dinner with your father, but unfortunately he could not join us to the ball.<eos> I would like you to meet my little niece.<eos> I do not think I've had the pleasure of meeting you before.<eos> Oh, would you excuse me.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Count Thurzo. I knew your late mother quite well.<eos> She was lovely...<eos> I am Countess Bathory.<eos> - Countess Erzebet Bathory? - Yes.<eos> What have you heard about me?<eos> Everyone respects and fears you.
Everyone respects and fears you.<eos> - Forgive me ...<eos> - I do not object to being feared.<eos> - Do I inspire fear in you?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I'm so very honored to meet you.<eos> And I you.<eos> - I am awfully sorry about Count Nadasky.<eos> - It was a dreadful shock to me and my children<eos> It might a manner to ask, but does your widowhood forbid you to dance?
- Maybe you were right about him.<eos> I did not even get a word of apology.<eos> Making me wait all day.<eos> You old witch!<eos> Your repulsive look scared my horse.<eos> Powerful now, but soon you will look like me.<eos> - And then you shall see.<eos> - How dare you.<eos> Out of my sight!<eos> Countess, you can not let someone who insults you in this manner go unpunished.
Erzebet, forget about him.<eos> I beg you!<eos> How?<eos> A man dresed in black at the door, asking for you.<eos> - A young man?<eos> - Count Dominic Vizakna, he says.<eos> - Should we let him in?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I wish to see him alone.<eos> - What brings you here so late?
I wish to tell you something.<eos> Pola, run away.<eos> Run, leave this castle.<eos> Run, or I will kill you.<eos> Pola!<eos> After my father's death, I found records of large sums of money sent to Dominic Vizakna.<eos> As well as a letter mentioning women of lower nobility who disappeared around that time.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I am Kasia from Rosenheim.<eos> My parents find you and punish you for this.
Dorothea, my white dress.<eos> You answered my prayers.<eos> Dear Count Thurzo, what a surprise after all this time.<eos> What has it been? Three years?<eos> - Five.<eos> - How quickly time flies.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me ask you, how have you been, my lady.<eos> I have been quite busy with this awful war.<eos> So, what brings you here?
It doesn't feel like six years.<eos> More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.<eos> Are we there yet?<eos> Yeah, we're there, sunshine.<eos> We're there.<eos> You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.<eos> You will be hungry.<eos> You will be weak.<eos> If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.<eos> The staff thanks you in advance.
Daytimes a bit tricky.<eos> Come by at nights.<eos> - Have a seat, Father<eos> - Let's get started.<eos> Koreans don't appreciate Mahjong.<eos> Would you like to play, Father?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I don't know how<eos> - I see.<eos> Did I tell you about Father Hyun praying for Kang-woo?
I am definitely coming back here.<eos> (ALL EXCLAIMING IN AWE)<eos> Am I a zombie now?<eos> (CHUCKLES) This guy reads too many comic books.<eos> Hey, Neera, um, now that this is all over,<eos> would you want to...<eos> Yes.<eos> But you didn't hear what I was gonna...<eos> Gross!<eos> Strap in, everyone, 'cause I'm taking you home.
I got a better idea.<eos> They got guns!<eos> Man, that is one killer-diller costume!<eos> Hey, gator, can you blow that horn?<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit in with us! We're playing Mardi Gras.<eos> We can't miss this!<eos> Little Louis going to finally play with the big boys!<eos> Naveen, you coming?<eos> I'll catch up with you later.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a seat, gentlemen.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> I assume that Tom has already told you about...<eos> - Mr. Danielson, everything okay?<eos> - Yes. Yes, sir.<eos> Just had to kill the phone.<eos> It's dead now.<eos> Okay, I assume Tom had already told you that he's decided to throw away the rest of his life playing golf.
Oh, God!<eos> Oh, my God, what's wrong?<eos> Ralph? Ralph?<eos> - Ralph?<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Ma'am—<eos> - No. - No. - Talk to me, sweetheart.<eos> The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express... his deep regret that your son, Walton Flanigan... died yesterday in Iraq.<eos> He— No. The Secretary of the Army extends his deepest sympathy... to you and your family in your tragic loss.<eos> A Casualty Assistance Officer will contact you within a few hours.
My fellow Americans, thank you for sharing this moment with me tonight.<eos> The subject matter I want to discuss with you, security... and peace, is both fundamental and crucial today.<eos> We and our allies... have managed to contain nuclear warfare for more than 30 years.<eos> This stable approach, by means of an offensive threat... worked well.<eos> After consultation my advisers...<eos> I think it is up to us to come up with a program, to counter the impressive Soviet nuclear missile threat... by defensive measures placed in Earth orbit.<eos> There are risks and the results will take time.<eos> But I think we can do it. When this step...<eos> I ask for your prayers and to support me.<eos> Thank you, good night, and God bless you!
Doctor, we've come all the way from Colorado.<eos> We heard that you had a serum here.<eos> It's my daughter, she's...<eos> My daughter is very sick.<eos> -How long?<eos> -A little over a week.<eos> -Is she bleeding from her ears yet?<eos> -No.<eos> Well, bring her in.<eos> Okay, kids, these nice people are gonna take you to your parents, who are all waiting outside.
Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> The very well stitched little Miss Brawne in all her detail.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What is this?<eos> What have I done?<eos> How have I offended?<eos> I don't shake hands with the enemy.<eos> An enemy?<eos> What have I done to you?
I see. I see. - There you are.<eos> - Have I upset you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I find you...<eos> I appreciate your frankness.<eos> - But you disapprove of me?<eos> - No! - I see it in your eyes.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> No. I think sexual behavior and intercourse how two men, or two women or men and women animals, combine their physical parts I find it completely neutral.<eos> Listen to you.
No wolf will stand before it.<eos> Ready the horses!<eos> Let someone else go.<eos> - Why?<eos> Last night, after I left...<eos> Just let someone else go.<eos> In case it has escape your notice, blacksmith...<eos> I am quite capable of looking after myself.<eos> And besides... you can watch over me from the wall.<eos> Lady Sonja, your father has ordered you to stay behind.
IHOP.<eos> Hello.<eos> Georgia Yanokoupolis.<eos> Pangloss Tours.<eos> -I'll see you on the bus.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Group B? Yes.<eos> Names.<eos> You don't speak English, do you?<eos> And Maria gave you to me.
ON RADIO:<eos> Pa 'a Ono.<eos> Pa 'a Ono. Honolulu Group, Honolulu Group.<eos> Mayday, mayday.<eos> Mayday, mayday.<eos> We have a young woman on marker buoy 1229E.<eos> She seems to be barely conscious.<eos> She's shivering up a storm, please advise.<eos> HONOLULU GROUP ON RADIO: Copy that.<eos> Rescue team will rendezvous with you at the buoy.
I had to research his organization.<eos> I had to find out about Shadaloo.<eos> I must congratulate you all, gentlemen.<eos> You've shown remarkably sound judgment.<eos> Not many municipal governments would take such a bold stand... against the criminal elements of their own population.<eos> People will point to you long after your time has passed.<eos> And here's the best part... your debts are now clean.<eos> What about our families?<eos> Your children have been returned.<eos> Mr. Bison thanks you for your continuing support.
There's only three.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why that there's no rig, no ceremony... no paint, no necklace.<eos> That's why the veil hasn't been lifted yet.<eos> Garrison Jacobs is not the third victim.<eos> What was he?<eos> Garrison Jacobs is Pestilence.<eos> I was trying to get my beauty sleep.<eos> Garrison Jacobs tricked us into punishing an innocent.<eos> What did he tell you?
No, Murphy.<eos> I'm fucking you all by myself.<eos> Get your hands up now.<eos> Get your hands up, up against that... up against that wall.<eos> Y'all are setting me up, and I don't even know why.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Think hard.<eos> Think all the way back to 1965, just before that hurricane hit.<eos> Y'all made DeWitt Prejean run with that chain locked around his chest, shot his leg out from underneath him.<eos> You didn't notice the boy that was watching you from across the swamp, though, did you?
I assume you know already.<eos> Will you be able to save him?<eos> I'm... Ernesto Martel.<eos> We will try our best, mister Martel, but at the moment we can't operate him.<eos> And tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow, maybe.<eos> We are feeding him via parenteral, he will need some blood to recover.<eos> Do all you can to save him, doctor.<eos> Don't doubt it.<eos> It's my obligation. I will inform you about the evolution in the following hours.
So is mine.<eos> Which of his operas do you enjoy most?<eos> - No, wait, let me guess.<eos> - As a matter of fact, yes.<eos> I used to like it too.<eos> Now I prefer Norma.<eos> Dashy!<eos> Go fetch it!<eos> Fetch it, Dash!<eos> - Have I offended you in some way?
You have to understand you reign by right of Parliament.<eos> Work with the voters' choice. - Lord Melbourne says...<eos> - He says what suits his interest.<eos> He has used you to punish his enemies without a thought for the damage to the Crown.<eos> The Queen is in the clutches of Melbourne, the great seducer!<eos> And when he is silent, who does she listen to?<eos> - Her German mother.<eos> - I'm glad he thinks I listen to Mama.<eos> You are confusing stubbornness with strength, my dear.<eos> And I warn you, the people will not like you for it.
And...what do you feed them?<eos> Flesh!<eos> I delivery you to these satanic creatures For the destruction of your flesh...<eos> And your spirit to meet faith...<eos> God have mercy of your soul!<eos> Pray for thee also!<eos> I remember this one, mates, he's not a fighter!<eos> Remember?<eos> What are you doing here, puritan?<eos> Here's what...to clear all of this evil of you!
No matter where you go.<eos> You understand that?<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> Ms. Bower.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, I'm very sorry.<eos> I know this must be difficult.<eos> "Difficult"?<eos> Do they teach you to say that, Ms. Bower?
Using the Translated subs floating around from an automated translation as a source for time stamps.<eos> Look at yourselves.<eos> Unplug from your chairs, get up and look in the mirror.<eos> What you see is how God made you.
Where is it?<eos> Right now it's in the hands of the Human Coalition.<eos> - How long have they had it?<eos> - A day...<eos> Maybe two.<eos> This is out of your hands.<eos> Military will handle this.<eos> - You called for us?<eos> - Take this to the federal building downtown.<eos> A woman will meet you there.
Oh, great.<eos> Can we tuck this in there?<eos> Listen, I'm not coming with you.<eos> - I made up my mind.<eos> - Gaius, our people need you.<eos> I don't belong to you, Paulla.<eos> I never belonged to you.<eos> You appropriated me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry if I led you to believe...
to reveal that which is hidden.<eos> Write down... what you hear and see. "<eos> You didn't hear the voice in a dream?<eos> I was fully conscious.<eos> What were you afraid of for so long?<eos> Of people's skepticism.<eos> Were you not more afraid that your visions weren't sent by God, but by the Devil?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> In such a sublime light, in such splendor... only the Almighty can appear.<eos> Did the voice explain to you what you saw?
Have you considered the decision to leave her here?<eos> Yes, she agrees.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> Forgive me, please.<eos> I am sure that you can teach Richardis humility.<eos> She certainly will.<eos> Let's discuss the enrollment rules.<eos> Very well.<eos> We shall give it a try.<eos> I called you here to discuss the rules of St. Benedict.
Who shall be the Devil?<eos> Our priest, Volmar.<eos> He's the only one who may not sing.<eos> He won't like that.<eos> - Who knows, perhaps he'd like to be a devil.<eos> You have embraced me.<eos> But now you destroy me through your repentance.<eos> But I shall conquer you!<eos> All your paths are evil, I have seen it.<eos> Now I fight against you.
God again afflicted me with illness, and my body fought for breath, so that my veins with my blood, my flesh with my fluids, and my marrow with my bones dried out as if my soul would flee.<eos> Then I saw a great host of angels from St. Michael's host.<eos> One of them called to me:<eos> "Ah, eaglel Why do you sleep in your wisdom?<eos> Rise up, for the sun has brought you forth. "<eos> Then the entire host cried with a mighty voice:<eos> "Your work is not yet complete.<eos> Up, upl Rise up and drinkl"<eos> Bring me food and drink.<eos> And what did the angels tell you?
I will finally write a work on the healing powers of nature, and on the causes and remedies of illnesses.<eos> And...<eos> I will go traveling to preach.<eos> Traveling to preach?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I do.<eos> It's unheard of.<eos> I'll be the first woman.<eos> - And turn everyone against you again.
When?<eos> When?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> The best thing you can do right now is to go home.<eos> You both need rest.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - No, no, that's what other police have told us to do, and if we'd stopped then, we wouldn't have found Jenny and the press, and we wouldn't be talking to you.<eos> But you are.<eos> You must let me take some of the load for you. You're both exhausted.<eos> Sleep and food will reenergize you.
It's basically just to give people a wow factor as they come in here.<eos> How to share your faith effectively and Biblically, to be able to reason with people, learn to circumnavigate or go around the person's intellect.<eos> There's plenty of people who would say, "Well, it's just my faith."<eos> But that's not good enough for you. You say, "No."<eos> We can basically reconcile the science<eos> "with what's in Genesis."<eos> We're an organization that... to put it in a nutshell... is telling people that the Bible's history is true, its history beginning in Genesis.<eos> Scientists line up overwhelmingly on one side of this issue.<eos> It would have to be an enormous conspiracy going on between scientists of all different disciplines in all different countries to have such a consensus.<eos> That doesn't move you?
Love, Jenny and John.<eos> We serve tea every day at 4:00, and dinner at 6:00 sharp.<eos> Oh, and these blankets are woolen.<eos> Good heat in 'em.<eos> - So-So they're electric?<eos> - Oh, not in this house.<eos> My brother died in a fire, God rest his soul.<eos> In this room, actually.<eos> Oh, not to worry. It's been re-papered.<eos> Well, good night to ya both. - And God bless you.
-Who signed the affidavit?<eos> -I did.<eos> Well, now, let me see if I have this correct, a woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed.<eos> And when it was finally written several days later, there was no need to sign it or to go to a judge because she was already in the asylum!<eos> -Is this correct, Captain?<eos> -Technically, yes.<eos> Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing... We were dealing with an extraordinary situation.<eos> Now, is it our fault that we were being deceived by a boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No.<eos> In light of his claims and her disturbing behavior, who wouldn't begin to think that there was something the matter with her?<eos> -Because she questioned you?
So the situation's hardly a debacle.<eos> Sand Saref has the blood of Heracles, yes.<eos> But we have what she wants.<eos> - All right, you fatheads listening to me?<eos> - We sure are, boss.<eos> Find Sand Saref, find her now.<eos> Tell her I have no problem with her. She can have her creepy, blingy thingy.<eos> Get me that blood.<eos> And keep it safe!<eos> Spill one drop and I'll turn you all into hamburger.
If I can help, I will.<eos> But the time difference...<eos> We'll manage.<eos> Fredaric?<eos> You're crying?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay!<eos> Everyone's here.<eos> Mr. Lambert will see you shortly.
- And what he-what that guy said.<eos> But-What both those guys said.<eos> God damn it, Bob!<eos> I'm about to reach over there and tear you a new asshole!<eos> Don't be a jackass.<eos> - It makes sense.<eos> - Fuck you, Bob! We talked this out!<eos> I don't see a need for that kinda language.<eos> Now, if you wanna go outside right now...<eos> I'll take both of you fuckers out right damn now!
That's tomorrow night, one night only... watch Dewie the Wrestling Bear attack me- and he's killed people in public before.<eos> Well, OK, that is some entertainment... and you are known for your creative promotions, Jackie, but-<eos> You're not gonna want to miss this, folks... and if you're a small child, you creep into your mama's bedroom at night... and you lift about 40 bucks...<eos> - outta your mom's purse-<eos> - No, no, no. ...and you walk down to Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum, eight o'clock!<eos> There ya have it.<eos> Jackie Moon, thanks so much for joining us.<eos> Dewie's insane!<eos> He could rip my head off!<eos> I'm Dick Pepperfield, reminding you there will be another night.
Been a long time, huh?<eos> If I call Stephen down here, he'll kill you.<eos> You're terrified, huh?<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> I'm an old man with no depth perception.<eos> You don't have to be scared of me.<eos> You know, it's been a funny thing, watching you boys take what I taught you and eclipse me.<eos> I am so proud to be a footnote in the life of the brothers Bloom.<eos> But you hate me.<eos> You probably won't believe, but I loved you both very much.
You're in the<eos> Paris of Western Pennsylvania.<eos> I'm really glad that you stopped by.<eos> I just saw Dad and the physician kissing in the den.<eos> I am going to puke.<eos> Why does physical affection bother you so much?<eos> It doesn't, actually.<eos> Well, you're not the only one who deserves to have a little fun.<eos> And what's your point?<eos> I saw you both at Gibraltar's.
"and helped us become strong, close readers and critical writers,<eos> "skills I've brought to my study of medicine.<eos> "Sincerely, Janet Hartigan, M. D ."<eos> Professor Wetherhold, I have a simple question.<eos> Why do you want to be head of the English department?<eos> I've been thinking about that quite a bit lately.<eos> As head of the department, how do you plan on rectitying the systematic subjugation of women in this institution?<eos> Julia, I haven't even vaguely considered that, nor do I plan to.<eos> You know what?<eos> None of you like me, and I don't blame you.
No. Oh, my God.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'll go with her.<eos> Me, too.<eos> All right. I'll go, too.<eos> I'll go, too.<eos> Well, you do whatever you like, but my wife is going nowhere.<eos> Dignity has no price.<eos> No one knows how many women are here.<eos> You can do what you like, and we'll feed you both.
Excuse me.<eos> - I don't believe we've been introduced.<eos> - No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.<eos> - I saw you talking with my husband.<eos> - Yes. He wanted to dance.<eos> That's not usually considered his forte.<eos> And you declined?<eos> I'm ill at ease with male company for the moment.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So what brings you to Bath?
No?<eos> Come on, mum and dad are out there. Come on, up you get darling.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Hey! You stop this! Charlie!<eos> No, no! I want to stay! What's wrong, Russell?<eos> You know Charlie has worked so hard for this, Russell. Are you right?<eos> You've been on stage before, remember?<eos> Do it for mum and dad, okay? Look at my face.<eos> Charlie, there is no need to spit at Russell!<eos> I will put you both... in time out!
We're not going to make it, are we?<eos> And even if we do, we still have to face the Jade Army.<eos> What if I can't handle it?<eos> What if I freeze?<eos> Don't forget to breathe.<eos> If we don't find water soon, we will perish.<eos> Perhaps a Taoist immortal can make rain.<eos> If he truly is a Taoist immortal.<eos> You are an insult to the name of Buddha! Blasphemy!<eos> I lead you to the mountain!
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.<eos> Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.<eos> "Drone on"? Jesus Christ.<eos> Where's your respect?<eos> You remember who you're talking about here.<eos> You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.<eos> Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.<eos> You goddamn media people.<eos> You are so smug.<eos> Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%, I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
What harm is one to anyone?<eos> Plenty, if it has a good mind to.<eos> I see.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I think I do.<eos> Father, if I've learned anything over the years, it's that you never, ever trust a corpse.<eos> I had hoped to be hearing these tales today.<eos> When I first heard that the snatchers Grimes and Blake had been reprimanded, I rushed here to meet with you.<eos> You've heard of us, then?<eos> Oh, your reputation precedes you in certain circles.
But lately I've come to accept them, and I actively pursue the tellers.<eos> Unfortunately, my time with them is brief.<eos> In fact, you'd be dead right now if it wasn't for me.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I paid the executioner for our time together.<eos> Is this the first time you've paid someone to be alone with a man, Father?<eos> You're not looking too funny right now Mr. Blake.<eos> Willie Grimes.<eos> Willie Grimes introduced you to the underbelly of the resurrection trade.
We had run-ins with a crowd of lunatics called the House of Murphy.<eos> Ah, the famed House of Murphy.<eos> I've heard many stories about Cornelius Murphy and his gang.<eos> Hated us they did.<eos> You see, we'd like to get in and out the yards unnoticed.<eos> But they would make this big song and dance out of it.<eos> He made us look like a right bunch of amateurs.<eos> You have any recent encounters with the House of Murphy?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, yes.<eos> But let me tell you about this one time.
I'm a size 8.<eos> What would we do if we see a grizzly bear?<eos> You know, any kind of bear.<eos> Well, most people would run, which would be the worst thing you could do.<eos> - I'd run.<eos> - You never try to outrun a bear, son.<eos> They can run between 30 and 35 miles per hour<eos> I don't have to outrun the bear. I'd just have to outrun you!<eos> So... uh... what do you do if you see a bear?<eos> If you spot a bear and he's not seen you yet, you quickly and quietly get away from it.
It'll be decided in a month.<eos> Note that... if the Board rules in his favor, his probation isn't irrevocable.<eos> He'll be bound by conditions that he must respect.<eos> But he was sentenced to life!<eos> I know, Justine.<eos> But in view of his age, his health problems and his good behavior in jail, he's eligible for a reduction of his sentence.<eos> That's the law.<eos> He butchered my father, tortured, raped and murdered my mother.<eos> That's good behavior?<eos> I hope he kills again, it'll serve you right!
I'm married.<eos> I'm not jealous of him.<eos> I don't mean of him, Mr. Seynaeve.<eos> I mean jealous of the women.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> What are you implying?<eos> You've got a nerve, insinuating that kind of thing!<eos> Why so fierce, Mr. Seynaeve?<eos> - Vincent's my best friend, always has been.<eos> - Your best friend has betrayed you all.
- I don't need lessons from you.<eos> Not about friendship.<eos> - But it's why I kept quiet.<eos> I thought this was your doing.<eos> You'd got here pissed, stoned, worked up...<eos> - Kiss my ass!<eos> It's time you gave up snorting coke!<eos> - It's time you gave up the booze!<eos> That's enough!<eos> Just listen to you!
"And one day, if you want to talk to me...<eos> "if you really want to...<eos> "pick a spot you like.<eos> "A spot where we used to go together.<eos> "You'll be able to talk to me... you'll see.<eos> "Because I'll be there.<eos> "And remember,<eos> "don't be ashamed to tell people you care about<eos> "that you love them.<eos> I love you both very much".
It's the crazy bats from the bridge!<eos> Open up.<eos> Sir Gwizdo, open the door...<eos> Whoa!<eos> not the ears, not the ears!<eos> Good move with the barrel, kid.<eos> Yes.. go find your own.<eos> Quit bothering the sheep!<eos> I'll bury you alive, you ugly beast!<eos> Hey bats foo on you, Sir Lian-Chu is too strong for you.
- Yes, discipline.<eos> - You know what's funny!<eos> I like Chelsea.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> She has beautiful legs.<eos> If I want legs, I'll take Obama's wife.<eos> She has legs. This is what happens when they talk politics.<eos> No, no, no, wife of McCain!<eos> She has the ass, and you know she's not getting any.<eos> I understand my assistant explained the job to you.
Lap dance.<eos> Lap dance?<eos> Syphilitical lap dance?<eos> Yeah.<eos> -You want a lap dance?<eos> -No.<eos> -You don't look so good.<eos> -I'm fine.<eos> Well, all right, boys.<eos> Now our own Bobby Sox is gonna tease you with her sock tease.
Lisa was graduating ...<eos> So we're here not only in remembrance, but also to celebrate her accomplishments.<eos> I know this gathering would have made Lisa very grateful and happy,<eos> so in her honor, let's share a moment of silence.<eos> I am sorry Daddy. Excuse me.<eos> Michael, I heard you took the kids fishing, the night before your mom's funeral.<eos> - Yes, we had tons of ...<eos> - And then we threw them all back.<eos> Yes, and then we threw them all back.<eos> - He took you out fishing ...
Who needs to know more than we do?<eos> Hey, motherfucker!<eos> I just lost three men on this goddamned goose chase of yours!<eos> I wanna know what the fuck is going on.<eos> Tell us what's happening.<eos> What was that thing last night?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> - We?<eos> - What, you and those pinheads at Langley?<eos> - Look... chief... all I can tell you is that I'm working for a special group inside the Company.
It does me.<eos> Grandparents in hell.<eos> Picture that.<eos> Picture your grandmother in hell baking pies without an oven.<eos> And if someone were in hell, I doubt very seriously he'd be smiling.<eos> I think he's down there now screaming up at us, and I think he's in severe pain.<eos> People just refuse to be realistic. They don't like to be realistic.<eos> People would rather stroke themselves, you know.<eos> Oh, they like to stroke themselves, don't they? Stroke themselves. They stroke each other.<eos> It's nothing but a big stroke job in this country. The government strokes you every day of your life. Religion never stops stroking you.
Pride goeth before a fall. Never forget Proverbs, okay.<eos> Now, here's another slogan - here's another slogan you run into all the time.<eos> "God bless America."<eos> Once again, respectfully, I say to myself, "What the fuck does that mean?"<eos> God bless America.<eos> Is that a request?<eos> Is that a demand?<eos> Is that a suggestion?<eos> Politicians say it at the end of every speech as if it were some sort of verbal tick that they can't get rid of.<eos> "God bless you and God bless America. God bless you and God bless America."
Sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government does not give a fuck about them.<eos> The government doesn't care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety. It simply doesn't give a fuck about you.<eos> It's interested in its own power. That's the only thing keeping it and expanding it wherever possible.<eos> Personally, when it comes to rights, I think one of two things is true.<eos> I think either we have unlimited rights or we have no rights at all.<eos> Personally I lean toward unlimited rights.<eos> I feel, for instance, I have the right to do anything I please.<eos> But if I do something you don't like, I think you have the right to kill me.<eos> So where are you going to find a fairer fucking deal than that?<eos> So the next time some asshole says to you, "I have a right to my opinion,"you say,"Oh yeah?
I left him here up on the porch.<eos> They will fucking kill you.<eos> Jesus Christ, they think they already fucking killed you.<eos> I only want my dog, that's all.<eos> Your mother, she covered him up for me.<eos> It's around the back.<eos> They threw your dog in the woods.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's evidence.<eos> Mr. Ludlow, it is fucking evidence of what they did to you.
"Nature's punishment for the cruelty mankind have inflected upon the Earth,"<eos> that's what she said. Mankind would survive without the need for food or water, but they would basically- Bunch of bloody savages.<eos> So what? Put a bullet in their head, and they're dead.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Linda Canavan had a son called Max. He disappeared shortly after she died.<eos> She took her own life.<eos> They all did. I just thought Max might have-<eos> Look, no oil, 16 million people on the verge of starvation, and the virtual collapse of society.<eos> Create the lie, instill the fear.<eos> The Jundies are coming to get you. They'll blow you up, poison your water, but we, the Corporation, will protect you.
Mengzhu!<eos> The sign language tactic!<eos> You scumbags!<eos> Who do you think you are meddling with?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You scumbags.<eos> Mengzhu!<eos> How have you all been?<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> I summoned you on an urgent business.
Stand!<eos> Fire!<eos> Stand!<eos> Stauffenberg!<eos> The people know we put our principles above personal gain.<eos> Make ready!<eos> Aim!<eos> Safe!<eos> Stand!<eos> You may hand us over to the executioner, but in three months' time, the disgusted and harried people will bring you to book and drag you alive through the dirt in the streets.
Hello.<eos> Hello. Welcome.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi, I'm Pepper Minkin, Ms Dana Strickland's attorney.<eos> Katie Lloyd.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Well, why don't we go in?<eos> Would either of you like coffee?
How many times do you wanna hear it?<eos> As many times as it takes to make sense.<eos> I followed a heavy Raider into the storm.<eos> Took some hits, passed out.<eos> When I came to, I was orbiting this planet.<eos> It's yellow moon and star matches the description in Pythia.<eos> I took these pictures in orbit.<eos> The star patterns match what we saw in the tomb of Athena.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I told you I don't know exactly.
Everyone in this room experienced tragedy at New Caprica.<eos> Have we forgotten?<eos> Will you open this order<eos> - to a full quorum vote? - No.<eos> We can override, madam president.<eos> I cannot let this stand.<eos> You can override, and you cannot let this stand, Mr. Adama?<eos> Then you open it up to a vote.<eos> And if you strike this down, you can all go back to your constituents and you can tell them what you've done, and "we, the people" will have triumphed.<eos> But think about what it's gonna cost you.
I don't think so.<eos> I think you download into another leoben body and you spew more lies.<eos> No one's coming back.<eos> We were lured out of resurrection range.<eos> Ship was attacked.<eos> We survived.<eos> The baseship was damaged.<eos> We were set adrift.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Who attacked you?
Move that cart!<eos> The Prince is dead!<eos> What harm did she do?<eos> Why?<eos> God will punish you for killing a poor innocent girl.
Come with us.<eos> Inside, where it's warm.<eos> What a nice new overcoat!<eos> Gusiev.<eos> Come in.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Have a seat, please.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> We'll take care of you.<eos> You're going through a rough time, your friends have deserted you, I know.
Care for some tea? - Did you kill him?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you know why you accuse us?<eos> You feel responsible and you must find a culprit. His comrades didn't kill him.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> There's just one way to give a sense to that boy's death:<eos> talk to us about his murderers.<eos> I don't know who they are.<eos> If you'd come directly to me, Gusiev would still be alive.<eos> Your silence got him killed. And this torments you.
You read "The Prophet" by Puskin.<eos> You read with strength and fervor.<eos> The hall was swept up by your words. When you spoke the final verses, I knew the waiting was over, it was time to act.<eos> So, when you wanted to see me, I just couldn't say no.<eos> We'll go via the attic and rooftops, hurry!<eos> - I'm coming with you. - No, goodbye.<eos> -Wait for me! -Go!<eos> I'm coming too.<eos> Hurry!<eos> I'll help you.
- Can you feel your legs?<eos> - I think so. The dashboard's just caved in.<eos> - Do you have a jack? - Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. It's in the trunk. All right.<eos> I'm gonna try to go get it, OK? I'll be right back.<eos> OK.<eos> Hurry, please!<eos> I can't hear you. Shit.<eos> ATT... Hey!<eos> - Jesus, people, what's wrong with you? - 911 emergency.
Papers like this...<eos> "General Sherman:<eos> A Total Badass"... ain't going to cut it.<eos> Your antics today clearly demonstrated... how serious you are about your studies.<eos> You, Anderson, you missed class yesterday.<eos> Actually, I didn't miss it at all.<eos> You think this is very funny, eh?<eos> This university won't miss any of you... next semester when you're expelled.<eos> That is, unless you all turn in... three new term papers... by, let's say, the end of spring break.<eos> Let me remind you of an old saying...
Can you believe these hicks actually think... we're gonna sleep in separate beds?<eos> Well, I say we hang, grab whatever we can... and blow.<eos> The whole town or just those frat boys?<eos> Don't worry, Ricky, I'll save one for you.<eos> What about saving one for me?<eos> Now, which one would that be... perhaps Mr. "I'll stay if you stay"?<eos> To our door<eos> Hey, handsome.<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> On behalf of our little town... I'm here to welcome y'all... and invite you to taking in some of our sites.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was just going to get my best suit in my car.<eos> I would hate to show up at the festival underdressed.<eos> You wouldn't know where the cars are parked, would you?<eos> Oh, oh.<eos> They parked them things... out by the barn.<eos> Ain't that right?<eos> Oh, yes, sir.<eos> Your car, sir, is parked right down yonder... by that there barn.<eos> Well, thank you kindly, gentlemen.
You Northerners may be used... to uptight ladies like Miss Joey.<eos> One country fuck, and all those city girls will seem like... nothing more than a hole in your mattress.<eos> What are you doing, huh?<eos> Putting in your retainer, baby?<eos> You could call it that.<eos> Help!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Well.<eos> Let's see, now.<eos> We... we done took him in... clothed you, fed you... give you a place to call home... and what'd you do to repay our gratitude, hmm?
Arise a knight and baron of Ibelin.<eos> Defend the king.<eos> - If the king is no more... protect the people.<eos> It is time now, my lord, to confess to holy God, not your son.<eos> Are you sorry for all your sins?<eos> For all but one.<eos> You sail now for Jerusalem, as your father wished.<eos> I'll follow within the week.<eos> Now the voyage is perilous.<eos> If God has purpose for you there, he'll keep you safe in his hands.

But this isn't adultery. It's washing.<eos> But if it were adultery... which it isn't... the Commandments are not for people like us.<eos> They are for the others.<eos> Did they give you something to eat?<eos> They said to wait until the master returned.<eos> My cook will prepare something while you wash.<eos> What?<eos> It seems years since I've seen a woman eat.<eos> Truly?<eos> I was watching you today.
Usually when a gate is blocked in, it is weaker than the wall around it.<eos> Or stronger.<eos> It is weaker.<eos> Rashid has seen it.<eos> This will be our door into Jerusalem.<eos> This is where we will make our stand.<eos> We must prepare.<eos> Brothers!<eos> Brothers!<eos> God has sent you this day!
I'll put that in evidence.<eos> Look, I can't testify. Cortland will kill me.<eos> It's a death sentence.<eos> Let's go outside and talk it over.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Nice job, Sharp.<eos> What's that they say? "Texas Rangers always get their man"?<eos> That's the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.<eos> You both have funny hats and funny boots.<eos> Who can tell you apart?
Quiet!<eos> Quiet for the king!<eos> Tonight, by Odin's grace and the bravery of our warriors, my daughter gained a husband,<eos> and our people a new king.<eos> To Sven and Freya.<eos> To Sven and Freya.<eos> Sire, friends,<eos> Thorsson's right.<eos> Our future is set and our people will prosper.<eos> And I vow to you that I will try to be as just and strong as Thorsson.
I see army men.<eos> I see... the Mars guy...<eos> Wait, Tommy.<eos> Tell me about Mars,<eos> Captain Shoemaker?<eos> - Get me an aerial shot ASAP,<eos> This is Shoemaker,<eos> They're watching you on the outside cameras.<eos> Chief Talley?<eos> The suspects inside the house are watching you,
Now, because of you, we're ruined!<eos> Because of me?<eos> I fail to see how this is my fault.<eos> - You're kidding, right, Marty? - You.<eos> You ticked off the people.<eos> You bit the hand, Marty.<eos> You bit the hand.<eos> "I don't know who I am.<eos> I got to go find myself in the wild." Oh, please.<eos> I did not ask you to come after me, did I?
Just 'cause things ain't easy, that's no excuse to take what's not yours, is it?<eos> That's stealing, right?<eos> And we don't steal.<eos> No matter what happens, we don't steal.<eos> Not ever. You got me?<eos> - Are you giving me your word?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Goon.<eos> - I promise.<eos> And I promise you... we will never send you away.
Apparently we're on foot from here.<eos> Why? Why we go this way?<eos> Why?<eos> Because even the animals would never come this way.<eos> - No weapons?<eos> - Weapons, uh...<eos> We keep the weapons.<eos> We work with other tools, Angelika.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I know this sophisticated technology must look very strange to you.
That's why they call you cursed.<eos> So tell me again, famous Brother Grimm, how exactly do you intend to save us?<eos> I think I'll do my own searching.<eos> I thought that went rather well.<eos> Gift.<eos> For surprise.<eos> For you.<eos> Tasty.<eos> Such German hospitality.<eos> The Brothers Grimm will thank you for your kindness.
Oh, I forgot.<eos> Everybody, come on.<eos> Parts, man.<eos> I need parts.<eos> You don't look that... bad.<eos> - Hey, everybody, spare parts!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What's wrong with you robots?
What's wrong?<eos> Bigweld is going dancing.<eos> Of course, the Bigweld Ball.<eos> You can't have the Bigweld Ball without Bigweld.<eos> Well, that's it, then.<eos> I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.<eos> What?<eos> That's the fanciest party of the year.<eos> You'll never get past the gate.<eos> - Can I help you?
Figures.<eos> And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.<eos> You judging me now, John?<eos> Betrayal, murder, genocide, call me provincial.<eos> I am simply seeking to inspire mankind to all that was intended.<eos> By handing Earth over to the son of the devil?<eos> Help me here.<eos> You're handed this precious gift, right?<eos> Each one of you granted redemption from the Creator.<eos> Murderers, rapists and molesters all of you, you just have to repent and God takes you into his bosom.

Hurry!<eos> - Edmund!<eos> - They'll hear you!<eos> No!<eos> - Get off!<eos> - You're playing into her hands.<eos> - We can't just let him go!<eos> - He's our brother!<eos> He's the bait!<eos> The Witch wants all four of you!
[PANTING] Amos?<eos> Amos?<eos> [WHIMPERING]<eos> MILLARD:<eos> Ah, ain't that sweet? I see a sappy love story brewing.<eos> Looking for this?<eos> Ha-ha-ha. Baby, it's all over but the cryin'.<eos> Brick?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Whoa. I was driving back to Wrestlepalooza, Saw you in the windows.
Capitalism works every time.<eos> Welcome to Bulgaria!<eos> Talk about a gypsy cab...<eos> If you please... I'm not Gypsy, I'm Russiam, big time difference, Roy Rogers.<eos> Yeah well, if you please, my name isn't Roy Rogers and it's not John Wayne either...<eos> It's William Cole.<eos> And I'm Jackie.<eos> My name is Igor...<eos> Igor, please to meet you...<eos> - What brings you to Brauda?
This has become a large problem, Avi.<eos> There's no such thing as problems, Mr. Green, only situations.<eos> Wake up, Mr. Green.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> How?<eos> How what?<eos> We've kept you alive, now you can tell me.<eos> How do you keep winning?<eos> It's very simple.<eos> You do all the hard work, I just help you along.
Alive?<eos> How the fuck...?<eos> Italians!<eos> - You don't say?<eos> We Croatians, they Muslims. - That's true!<eos> Don't ask for it, you bitch!<eos> How do you like the lamb?<eos> A dead mouth would eat it!<eos> Ask them about the carpet...<eos> It's a modest feast, but what the fuck, we weren't expecting you!
They're unloading something... Must be the carpet! - And now what?<eos> They stock everything in the warehouse.<eos> If we could just go in... - We have to be quick like<eos> Children! - Bambini!<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> It hurts...<eos> - It will pass.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> - Of course I will.<eos> Allah will punish you for my pain...
And if we don't get a ride soon, we won't need the Guide to tell us how unpleasant the Vogons are.<eos> They've already destroyed a planet today.<eos> That always makes them a little...<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Put this in your ear.<eos> We have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers.<eos> The fish is translating for you.<eos> The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the universe.<eos> It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies, and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain.<eos> The practical upshot of which is that, if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language.
We've put you through enough trouble already.<eos> "...as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee."<eos> Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.<eos> The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria.<eos> During a recitation by their Poet Master, Grunthos the Flatulent, of his poem Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning, four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.<eos> "Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurgle..."<eos> The absolute worst poetry was by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex.<eos> Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was.<eos> "See if I don't." Yeah.<eos> So, Earthlings, I present you with a choice.
Good day.<eos> Get off of me.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> No, wait, wait.<eos> There's been some kind of mistake.<eos> - Tick all the boxes on the right.<eos> - Right.<eos> Not that one.<eos> What to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue.<eos> Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far.
Okay, everybody, settle down.<eos> Okay, working very quietly, like little mice.<eos> I don't want to see or hear what you're doing.<eos> Okay, so, Isabel, just to refresh your memory, Darrin's ex-girlfriend...<eos> I read the script.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's just go over it one more time.<eos> Oh, and we rehearsed it a lot.<eos> Well, I'm aware of that.<eos> Darrin's ex-girlfriend has invited you both over for dinner.
Just say Fagin, and the traps will know.<eos> The traps?<eos> The police.<eos> What can I do to serve you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You can do nothing.<eos> I am past all hope indeed.<eos> Take this as a reward.<eos> No, I've not done this for money.<eos> God bless you.
Brimstone is lost.<eos> Be sure this message arrives.<eos> - It is of grave importance.<eos> - Yes, Katarin.<eos> The spoils of Rome.<eos> Only one Brimstone remains.<eos> Bring me my thralls.<eos> The time has come to fulfiill your oaths, my loyal thralls.<eos> Scour the land. Find Brimstone and destroy it. Bring the dhamphir to me.<eos> Leave no human alive that crosses you. The promise of eternal life awaits those who succeed.
I... I'm beholden to you.<eos> You... you Russian?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, I... I was listening just now when you were talking with your friend, and I...<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't be eavesdropping on people.<eos> You know, it's just that since I lost the use of these eyes I can't...<eos> No, no, it's all right.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I know that, um, times are hard for you people.<eos> You've been thrown out of your country, and no one willing to take you in.
- Alejandro.<eos> - Elena.<eos> - Armand.<eos> - De la Vega.<eos> - Count.<eos> - You know each other?<eos> We shared a giggle at the buffet table.<eos> It seems that's not all we have shared.<eos> Allow me to defuse an awkward situation.<eos> Elena has portrayed you as a man of impeccable character.
Armand, good evening.<eos> Governor Riley.<eos> You honour us with your presence.<eos> May I present my wife, Mary.<eos> Your speech was incredibly moving, count.<eos> I'm glad you're not running for office against my husband.<eos> I wouldn't challenge the man who's going to lead California into the Union.<eos> I fear there may not be much of a Union left to join, governor.<eos> Everyone, may I introduce Colonel R.S. Beauregard, of the 1st Alabama Infantry.<eos> What brings you here, colonel?
You had enough.<eos> Stinky...<eos> Aren't you forgetting something, estúpido? !<eos> Count Armand with his fancy wine and the froufrou accent.<eos> How could Elena choose a man like that?<eos> I'll make her want me back so badly, she will be weeping with desire.<eos> Nobody leaves my tequila worm dangling in the wind!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you, señor.
In Miami?<eos> You have to find someplace else to live while we're gone.<eos> Oh, come on. Not now.<eos> This is the worst possible time.<eos> And who goes to Miami in August?<eos> That's what I said. Come on.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's beautiful this time of year.<eos> Grandpa, it's a sauna down there and it rains every single afternoon.<eos> The Kushners are taking you for a ride.
His name is Jonathan.<eos> - Sorry ...<eos> Jonathan.<eos> I'll make you a promise.<eos> Look towards the deep end.<eos> It's 12 feet deep. I'll promise you that by the end of winter you'll be diving in the deep end and loving it.<eos> Relax, we'll take it real slow.<eos> You won't be forced to do anything you don't want to.<eos> Don't we get a cork belt or water wings?<eos> No, the cork keeps you from discovering the water.
- Work.<eos> - I Thought that you were of rest today.<eos> - I should go.<eos> - The girls need company.<eos> Soul!<eos> - THE food is in the oven.<eos> - Nobody is going to eat, if não will go served. I promised that It did the extra expedient today.<eos> It says that you mislead you.<eos> Maldição, Soul!<eos> - They Are necessary that push you?
The entire boys basketball team at Richmond High School... has been benched.<eos> The highly ranked Oilers have a perfect season on the court... but some players were in big trouble academically.<eos> And in an unprecedented move, Coach Ken Carter canceled practice... locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library.<eos> Now, at the start of the season, I understand you made... all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team.<eos> What exactly were the conditions of that contract?<eos> The contract states that the players maintain a 2.3 grade point average.<eos> And that the players must attend all their classes... and sit in the front row of those classes.<eos> Coach Carter, it's an unusual strategy, and a risky one in a sense... in light of your team's winning record. But I think there's gonna be... a lot of people pleased to learn that at least somebody... still cares about the concept of the student athlete.<eos> Thanks a lot for joining us today.<eos> I'm so sorry to disturb you.
A couple on the weather ... or what their left.<eos> I wanted to help them but I could not do anything. And that guy ...<eos> Oh, God. The boy was scalped ... There was blood everywhere!<eos> It was a trucker ... I saw a trucker, a semi trucker.<eos> I am afraid that one ... this is my Rose has.<eos> Wait ... give us some petrol so that way we can.<eos> No, I needed every drop for my wife to find.<eos> But you are welcome to me to find the morning.<eos> Are we still your prisoner?<eos> I want you in mind. On both of you!
Good, good, good.<eos> All right, I have an announcement.<eos> Yes...<eos> Your Great-Aunt Adelaide is coming for tea today. - No!<eos> - Aunt Adelaide is vile and vicious.<eos> She's blind as a bat.<eos> And we are convalescing, for heaven's sake! That's enough.<eos> I don't want to hear... anything bad about her. She pays the rent. - She scares me.<eos> - She's only coming for tea.<eos> You'll all put your best clothes on and Nanny McPhee will keep you in order.
We'll have a new one made.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> If I'd discussed it with you before, we wouldn't be in this mess.<eos> No, it was our fault.<eos> We should have known you had a good reason for getting married.<eos> At least this way, we'll all be together.<eos> That's what matters most, isn't it?<eos> I promise I'll never hide anything that affects us from you again.
Lady Stitch!<eos> Selma, there's footmen.<eos> Oi, make way!<eos> Where's the woman? - Aunt Adelaide...<eos> - Shut up! Where's the woman, Cedric?<eos> May I present my...fiancee, Selma Quickly.<eos> Selma, this is Lady Stitch.<eos> Your Ladyness. Welcome, if I may be so bold, to our humble, nay, lowly festivities.<eos> You shower glory upon us from above.<eos> The very air about you shines with... with...with aboveness.
All the computers are gone.<eos> Most of the gear.<eos> Now, come on, Sarge.<eos> It's my favorite holiday.<eos> I even put on my very special, sexy holiday boots.<eos> Even though we're here, I wanna do it right.<eos> How could you possibly do it wrong?<eos> Never take for granted the greatest power of all -- the power to choose.<eos> Consider the choices you have made in the past.<eos> And when they led you astray, faith in times of opposition... will lead to your salvation, or often the easy way will lead only to temptation.
Delta means you're 4.<eos> Three?<eos> The whole reason you exist is because everyone wants to live forever.<eos> It's the new American dream.<eos> There's people out there that are rich enough to pay anything for it.<eos> Don't people care that they kill us?<eos> That they take parts from us?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They think you're vegetables simmering in a jelly sac.<eos> Why do you think Merrick has you stuck in an old military bunker below ground?
Come on!<eos> I'm gonna swing around to get a shot.<eos> He's coming back.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hang on.<eos> It's coming off the building.<eos> Jesus must love you!<eos> That was the craziest mess I ever seen!<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> I know Jesus loves you.
Hello, Detroit.<eos> What a pleasure to be here.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we in the exciting field of dental supply sales are here in the Motor City for a reason-- to provide quality, precision tools to professionals who demand the very best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoa-ho-ho, thank you very much.
Tell Smallweed to let the matter rest for one month and then foreclose on the debt.<eos> I don't... I don'tquite understand you, Mr Tulkinghorn.<eos> I did not expect to have to justify my actions to my clerk, Clamb.<eos> But, since you ask, I choose to foreclose on the debt because I wish to do it, and because I can do it.<eos> Sergeant George is going to have to learn that there is a price to be paid for acts of defiance.<eos> Quite clear, Clamb?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> Then go and do as I tell you.
Don't be afraid of the soldiers.<eos> Always look them in the eye.<eos> And remember:<eos> You are in control.<eos> Their lives are in your hands.<eos> Stay calm.<eos> Never forget the soldier who discovers you is a dead man.<eos> He has nothing to gain, because he's afraid of death.<eos> If you're not afraid of death, you're in control of life.<eos> If he insists on checking you, let him do so at the gates of paradise.
- He runs Dekan... for the Russian mafia.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Dekan.<eos> Entertainment.<eos> Clubs, films.<eos> You want to be in the fuck business?<eos> I can make you look really good.<eos> Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I don't think so.<eos> If we wanted to talk to this Gorman Bellec, how do we go about doing that?<eos> She will tell you where to find him... but I'll give you a piece of advice.
Serves him right. So he'll stop saying all this bullshit.<eos> We want Brancaccio to live a joyful day.<eos> But we need to understand one thing.<eos> A question to all those who row in the opposite direction:<eos> Why are you obstructing those who are trying to create a better society for your kids?<eos> Then the usual refrain:<eos> "Father, things will never change!"<eos> Can't you see that something is changing?<eos> Don't you realize more and more kids come to our center?<eos> Do their smiles frighten you?
BABY SHARK<eos> Suck my dick.<eos> Suck my dick!<eos> Fuck off, you're making me lose.<eos> Suck my dick, damn it!<eos> - Suck my dick.<eos> - Fuck off and die.<eos> You're getting on our nerves.<eos> She let you out on time, unbelievable!
With you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Can I open it?<eos> Course.<eos> I hope it will you.<eos> Thus, the monster lives ...<eos> He breathes, he feels, it kills, but do not worry the truth.<eos> Looking good:<eos> deep in your heart the key is hidden which will free you from sin.
They're coming.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open!<eos> Bilike, Dawa!<eos> I've seen your horses!<eos> Erguotou!<eos> How did you get here?<eos> - How did you find us?<eos> Wasn't easy!<eos> We've been looking for you the whole night.
- The teachers are nice.<eos> It doesn't work Without beatings.<eos> Somebody at home?<eos> Can we come in?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Hello.<eos> Some friends you are, beating each other!<eos> Dawa, give Bilike his ball back.<eos> To fight over such a silly thing!<eos> What's keeping you?
—Yes, work stuff.<eos> —Of course.<eos> Look, anything you hear can be useful:<eos> Deals, missing arms, explosives .... —Do you have a piece of paper?<eos> —Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> —Cross my number out.<eos> —What?<eos> Nothing. That's my number.<eos> Excuse me, officers, the General will see you now.
You're a fool, Maybold.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> An even bigger fool than me, if that can be imagined.<eos> You're drunk, sir.<eos> And you a churchwarden.<eos> She loves you.<eos> - Who loves me?<eos> - Miss Fancy Day.<eos> Miss Day?<eos> She loves you but believes you are above her station.
You are the best thing to have happened to this village for a generation and this is how they treat you.<eos> - You have nothing to reproach yourself for, sir.<eos> - They are simple folk.<eos> Like beasts of the field, they are fascinated when a peacock lives amongst them.<eos> Forgive them.<eos> Miss Day.<eos> Fancy.<eos> It will ever be thus in this place.<eos> You, a pearl before swine.<eos> Let me take you away, my dear, let me show you palaces and kings, oceans and cathedrals.
A bandage, please.<eos> Are you bored?<eos> The emergency drill is over.<eos> The dead and the injured have suffered.<eos> Let them now get up and walk away with a bright face.<eos> Our strength was challenged by this exercise.<eos> You are all heroic volunteers.<eos> Relax, it is over now.<eos> Please stand in line, no need to hurry.<eos> - The sunlight will cheer you up.
The Earth at first welcomed her gift and then it swallowed her small body.<eos> Infinite goodness was her failure<eos> and the Earth swallowed her small body.<eos> It was not worth it, it was not worth it, it was not worth it.<eos> If you feel like being good again, think twice and forget your fantasy.<eos> Goodness does not heal.<eos> You can witness evil but you can't fight it.<eos> It was not worth it, it was not worth it, it was not worth it.<eos> Better to be a murderer than a saint.<eos> In the end the Eternal will judge you.
If you stay, I`ll give you this house.<eos> All the rooms, the fields, the olive trees.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You should find some fuel.<eos> Go!<eos> I know you won`t accept it but in any case I am doing the most important thing in my life.<eos> I never did anything so important and tonight I`ll do it.<eos> You are doing an important thing when you make mines explode.<eos> You jsut say that because you don`t want to stay.<eos> - Is somebody else waiting for you in Bologna?
- It's the kids, what I can do?<eos> Stop the car, Salim.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> What is it, is it the car again?<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All of you told me to stop and<eos> Go on, move it.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> Hüseyin, Ayþegül, what happened to you?
Putting my trust solely in the love of God and in the prayers of my brothers, I hope to fulfill these expectations. In as much as the goodness of God is bestowed upon me.<eos> You must know, dear brothers, that before you take the eternal vow, you still have the freedom to leave.<eos> On the other hand, we too reserve the freedom and the right to refuse you, in the case that we do not consider you fit for our way of life.<eos> Do you agree?<eos> Yes, Reverend Father.<eos> Step nearer, now, for the embrace of peace.<eos> In the name of God, of our Order, in my own name and in the names of all the brothers of this community, I welcome you into the community of the Order.<eos> Dom Marie-Pierre... from now on you shall live in the cell and follow the additional rules of our Order.<eos> You are at God's disposal alone, in solitude and stillness in an everlasting prayer and a joyful penitence.<eos> I leave you to the master of novices who shall visit you at the appropriate time and watch over your training.
Tell me the details so I can decide on the price.<eos> How much money will you bring me when I hand you over?<eos> Always the same routine...<eos> They need to be beaten to start speaking.<eos> You...<eos> Stop!<eos> She... She's the one! She attacked us!<eos> Welcome.<eos> I've heard interesting stories about your skills.<eos> I'm the boss of... I told you to take your hands off of him.
May Your Majesty reconsider.<eos> Cheo-seon!<eos> Am I King or not?<eos> Am I still King when my dead father still rules, huh?<eos> Your Majesty, calm yourself.<eos> The prudent hunter treads silently to capture the prey.<eos> So, the ministers want us out?<eos> But the King told us to stay.<eos> Wasn't that by a Royal order?<eos> They see you as vermin, to be gotten rid of as soon as possible.
You were incredible!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> Didn't I do well?<eos> No What are you waiting for to carry me sweetpie?<eos> I talked to my boss.<eos> I told him it was great!<eos> See?<eos> She's saying it was great<eos> I would like to thank all those who are here today for this great party<eos> May God bless you!
I could only draw enough blood... to make one shot.<eos> If you can get that into quarantine, one shot might be all you need.<eos> Nina, where's ryland?<eos> A 4400 gave up the seattle safe house.<eos> They're on their way to take it down.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Please don't shoot.<eos> Dr. Burkhoff, why would we shoot you?<eos> I have no idea, but i'm feeling a little insecure right now.<eos> I brought something for you.
-She's bleeding bad.<eos> -Take her to the infirmary.<eos> Park was arrested.<eos> Crowley, beat him in irons.<eos> Baldwin, what are you doing?<eos> Until we know what happens, no one goes in or out.<eos> What happens?<eos> SECURITY PROCEDURE ENABLED Who's a good girl? Isabelle.<eos> Isabelle is smart.<eos> Nice of you to have fun. Lily.
They offered to sway the committee's decision for my release... and I, in turn, would be indebted to them.<eos> It was not made clear what that would entail, but I had an idea.<eos> You've been lying to us this whole time.<eos> There's no justification. However, faced with spending the rest of my life in prison while my daughter was in the hospital, I...<eos> Nadia hasn't made any improvement.<eos> Why admit this to us now?<eos> What's changed?<eos> Nadia won't be getting better, Jack. If I have to face a life without my daughter...<eos> I still have to live with myself.<eos> It sounds hollow, I know, in light of what I just told you... but I consider you both to be my family. You expect us to forgive you now?
RBMK.<eos> Then you'll need two people to retrieve the coil -- one to ensure the reactor stays in standby mode while the other enters the test chamber to grab the coil.<eos> Yeah. That's right.<eos> That means you're missing one man to override security.<eos> Then I'll join the team.<eos> As third man,<eos> I'll access the security system while you and Vaughn recover the coil.<eos> Once the mission is complete, we can bring Vlachko back for questioning.<eos> If we need a third man, Dixon is more than capable.<eos> Actually, Jack's experience will serve you well -- unless there's something about this mission that you haven't told me.
Of course she is.<eos> Sydney and Vaughn learned that Irina was moved yesterday from Prague.<eos> She was taken to a remote location in Guatemala.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> While Vaughn secures Lucien Nisard for extradition and transport, you and I are meeting Sydney in country.<eos> You don't seem relieved.<eos> Transport's waiting.<eos> Here's a satellite layout of the camp where your mother's being held.<eos> The river will take you within 100 yards of the perimeter.
Who do you work for?<eos> You forgot to say the magic word.<eos> Now you're gonna have to say "pretty please."<eos> Last chance.<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> She works with me.<eos> Nadia?<eos> He had his men secure us in the lab.<eos> By the time we escaped, he was gone.<eos> When I tasked you to do research on Cesar Martinez, why didn't you inform me the two of you knew each other?
But if we do that, we lose Dean.<eos> Once he realizes his hacker is missing, he'll disappear as well.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay. I want you both to accompany Marshall to Prague.<eos> Follow the signal. Locate Dean's operation there.<eos> But don't do anything to reveal yourself or to engage his men.<eos> Once you've done that, we'll reassess our options.<eos> Shouldn't Dixon be going with me?<eos> I've tasked Dixon to another assignment.<eos> Marshall will brief you on your op tech.
Marshall.<eos> Working on it.<eos> Hold on. Wait a sec.<eos> Come on.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sergei Danislov and Elena Vasya.<eos> Weapons, drugs.<eos> Suspected terrorist affiliations include the Novgorod authorit--<eos> They're responsible for the Grozny bombing in '98. They killed 47 people.<eos> I went ahead and did a little shopping for you.
Presidential suite at the Biltmore.<eos> Candlelit dinner on the cliffs overlooking the ocean.<eos> So we went into town, and she wouldn't stop talking about the zoo.<eos> So we went to the zoo.<eos> Figured I'd get it over with.<eos> And then I saw how happy it made her.<eos> It made me forget about all my stupid plans.<eos> And here we had a personal chef making this unbelievable meal at the hotel, but...<eos> I proposed on one knee in sawdust in front of a giraffe with a crooked neck. Now how can I resist the charms of young love?<eos> Tell you what.
- I've got him on the ropes.<eos> - Thankyou for seeing us, Principal Lewis.<eos> My husband is just a teeny bit concerned... that Steve may not be ready for sex education.<eos> That's right.<eos> Mywife didn't spend 36 hours squeezing Steve from her birth canal... soyou could shove his face right back in there!<eos> The state requires that he take sex ed in order to graduate.<eos> Fine. Then instead ofyour bohemian filth fest... I demand he be offered a more wholesome, family-friendly alternative.<eos> And who doyou propose teach this stupid class?<eos> I'm Professor Smith.<eos> You should all be grateful your parents signed you up... for this morally upright health class.
- I am not a lady!<eos> - Wait, Stan.<eos> You forgot your purse.<eos> I swear I'd lose my own head if...<eos> Hey!<eos> Heaven, Pearly Gates, angels?<eos> It's all a lie.<eos> When your parents die, they'll be in the ground, worms slowly chewing through their foul, putrid organs.<eos> Don't worry, kids.<eos> God is real, Jesus loves you, et cetera.
You told Gob to do it, didn't you?<eos> Did you just wanna get us at each other's throats again like you used to do with the Boyfights videos?<eos> Boyfights?<eos> We have this video.<eos> The tapes were a big hit in Latin America.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I had nothing to do with them.<eos> Except for some of the Baby-Buster shorts.<eos> And maybe I was trying to teach you something.<eos> Maybe I was trying to teach you how to compete.
We can take the carpool lane.<eos> - I need ice.<eos> - I'm glad Sitwell's coming over.<eos> Let him see that we're doing fine as a family.<eos> The only help we need is from each other.<eos> - And apparently whatever's in that bottle.<eos> - Thanks for reminding me. - My Teamocil.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Teamocil?<eos> Isn't that that supplement that you and Tobias were hocking before the F.D.A. Shut you down?
Maggie Schilling was in that refrigerator between 10 and 12 months.<eos> Even though we already had medical records and dental records from which to identify Maggie Schilling<eos> I was also asked to do a sketch based on the architecture of her skull.<eos> That's sort of what I do.<eos> Turned out pretty accurate, if I do say so myself.<eos> She was a pretty girl.<eos> That's why I drew her smiling.<eos> It... it just seemed right.<eos> I'm really sorry for what happened to her.<eos> And I hope my work helps you.
They've searched our house, talked to our friends.<eos> until we can identify the body, we have to investigate.<eos> So identify the body. The longer you wait...<eos> Do you know what it's like for us?<eos> His body was fragmented by the blast.<eos> We're still retrieving pieces...<eos> I understand how difficult this is, not knowing.<eos> I'll work as quickly as I can to get you what you need.<eos> That's why I asked for his history. Where he grew up, any injuries from his youth, medical records. Of course.<eos> I brought you what you asked for.
- That's fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right. Good.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mickey, you're here.<eos> Feeling better ?<eos> Hey, pro, thanks for keeping us waiting.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
You've got, what, three new transponders ?<eos> That makes you a very powerful man.<eos> Dangerous man.<eos> My work is spreading God's message.<eos> That's... a powerful calling.<eos> The only 'danger' I can see is failing to... spread the message in all those in need of salvation.<eos> Salvation can mean different things to different people.<eos> Exodus sixteen, verse fifteen. "And the children of Israel said :<eos> to one another, it is manna."<eos> "And Moses said : this is the bread the Lord has given you to eat."
Stand up!<eos> Come here!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Did my son beat you up?<eos> No, we were beating them up. Is that true?<eos> Did they beat you up?<eos> Nah, it didn't hurt that much. Jimmy?<eos> PJ?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What have I told you about ganging up on people?
So we are going to go to my house, I made banana bread, and we'll put on a fresh pot and just talk about anything.<eos> That .. sounds so nice ..<eos> It's just, I'm booked solid today.<eos> My head's going to explode.<eos> Can I take a rain check?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks for understanding.<eos> Ok, I will call you tonight, and we'll figure out a time later in the week.<eos> Tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem .. why don't I just figure out a time and call you?
Got to march!<eos> I was just researching my book, and I found the strangest thing:<eos> No one with my father's name was ever a Merchant Marine.<eos> Did I say Merchant?<eos> I just meant the regular Marines.<eos> I thought you probably did, so I checked that too.<eos> And he wasn't there.<eos> So I called the VA [Veteran's Affairs department] and there is not a single record of anyone named Harrison Ross in Viet Nam.<eos> This is not the time, Suzie.<eos> What's the hold-up with you?
- Here I am.<eos> - Mickey the idiot.<eos> Be fair, she's not exactly gonna outrun us, is she?<eos> She's got a teleport! That's cheating.<eos> Now, we're never gonna get her!<eos> The Doctor's very good at teleports.<eos> I could do this all day.<eos> This is persecution.<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> What did I ever do to you?
- The child.<eos> That's where he was killed.<eos> That's where it all started.<eos> And I'm gonna find out how.<eos> - He'll get you.<eos> - And then he'll come for us.<eos> - He always comes for us.<eos> - No, Ernie, he doesn't.<eos> He always comes after me.<eos> There are things I haven't told you.
Two homes ago.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's better on the streets anyway.<eos> It's better food.<eos> Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us.<eos> - So that's what you do, is it, Nancy?<eos> - What is?<eos> Soon as the sirens go, you find a big, fat family meal, still warm on the table, with everyone down in the air raid shelter and bingo.<eos> Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London town.<eos> Puddings for all, as long as the bombs don't get you.
- Does it matter?<eos> It has nothing to do with this.<eos> This started at the bomb site.<eos> It's got everything to do with it.<eos> - What kind of warship?<eos> - An ambulance.<eos> Look. That's what you chased through the time vortex.<eos> It's space junk, I wanted to kid you it was valuable, it's empty.<eos> I made sure of it, nothing but a shell.<eos> I threw it at you.
- She's seen too much!<eos> Get her in the hearse!<eos> Legs!<eos> Gas.<eos> It's made of gas.<eos> Rose!<eos> You're not escaping me, sir!<eos> What do you know about that hob-goblin? Hmm?<eos> Projection on glass, I suppose.<eos> Who put you up to it?
I need someone to get up to the O.R. Floor.<eos> The chief needs a right hand.<eos> Oh, and yeah, number four...<eos> George.<eos> ...Everything. Everything is a competition.<eos> Okay, people.<eos> The rules of trauma -- don't mingle with E.R. Interns -- they don't know their ass from their esophagus.<eos> Sew fast, discharge faster.<eos> Get bodies up to the O.R.<eos> And don't let me catch you fighting over patients.
I've been wondering to myself,<eos> "why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?"<eos> You know you're my boss, you know it's against the rules, you know I keep saying no -- it's the chase.<eos> Well, it's fun, isn't it?<eos> You see?<eos> This is a game to you.<eos> But not to me.<eos> Because, unlike you, I still have something to prove.<eos> I know you see me resecting this bowel.<eos> Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking?
Where is the bride?<eos> - Ask the businessman and patriot.<eos> Everybody listen.<eos> The bride has fled.<eos> Chief, the bride has fled.<eos> Chief, your siter is gone.<eos> My sister...<eos> Stop it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your brother will not abandon you.
Not tonight. One hour.<eos> I'll be gone one hour.<eos> - I found my boys. - Well done, Gavroche.<eos> Marius.<eos> The law is here to protect you, Cosette from criminals like this scum.<eos> Is Valjean here? Is he alone?<eos> I'll never tell you anything.<eos> Do you know who and what you're protecting? Didn't he tell you he's a common thief?<eos> - I know exactly who he is. - Oh, yes?<eos> Did he tell you who you are?
He loves me, Papa.<eos> He loves me.<eos> Take her to our old house. It's going to be all right.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Fire at will!<eos> So here we are.<eos> I was right.<eos> You know him?<eos> When we have a spare bullet, we're going to kill him.<eos> Waiting for you in the house where you fell in love.
I deal in post-traumatic stress and survival guilt.<eos> Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what's going on here.<eos> SEAMAN:<eos> Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.<eos> NORMAN:<eos> I'm a psychologist.<eos> NORMAN:<eos> That's why I was sent here.<eos> TED:<eos> I told you people I need a phone.
NORMAN:<eos> Have you called your wife?<eos> HARRY:<eos> No.<eos> NORMAN:<eos> Why not?<eos> INSTRUCTOR:<eos> This'll be a saturation dive.<eos> You'll be going to a habitat in 1,000 feet of water.<eos> A sub will take you to the Habitat and you'll transfer aboard.
INSTRUCTOR:<eos> This'll be a saturation dive.<eos> You'll be going to a habitat in 1,000 feet of water.<eos> A sub will take you to the Habitat and you'll transfer aboard.<eos> At 1,000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.<eos> You could actually take a quick dip. The pressure wouldn't bother you.<eos> Although I wouldn't recommend it because the water's so cold you'd freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.<eos> That's the reason for the diving suits.<eos> Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.<eos> Following this briefing, I'll take you to an onboard dive tank.
Henry.<eos> Prince Henry left early this morning, Baroness.<eos> No-one seems to know where he went.<eos> I've brought you something... that will brighten up your day.<eos> It's a...<eos> Oh, you vicious, vicious man!<eos> It makes me want to cry.<eos> Pick one.<eos> I could no sooner choose a favorite star in the heavens.<eos> What is it that touches you so?
Besides, if you broke your royal neck, where would we be?<eos> You swim alone, climb rocks, rescue servants.<eos> Is there anything you don't do?<eos> Fly.<eos> Now turn around so I can climb back down.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's you again.<eos> Stay aloft, madam.<eos> There are games afoot.<eos> My wife thanks you for this fine garment, mademoiselle.
Why did you have to be so wonderful?<eos> Now, then.<eos> What was it you wanted to tell me?<eos> Simply that... last night was the happiest night of my life.<eos> I must go.<eos> Nicole!<eos> No.<eos> Of all the insidious jokes, making your mother a comtesse.<eos> It's almost as absurd as a prince frequenting a servant who sleeps with pigs!<eos> What bothers you more, Stepmother?
Signor da Vinci!<eos> Yes?<eos> Oh, mistress, it's no use!<eos> Allow me.<eos> Oh, brilliant!<eos> Why, that was pure genius.<eos> Yes.<eos> I shall go down in history as the man who opened a door.<eos> Gustave!<eos> Maurice said the Prince was expecting you.
I wish...<eos> No.<eos> Wishing is wrong.<eos> It's the wrong word right now.<eos> What I mean is... I believe in God.<eos> Relax.<eos> I know a lot of you don't, but I still want to offer a prayer... for our survival.<eos> Mine included.<eos> Because I believe that God, whomever you hold that to be, hears all prayers, even if sometimes the answer is no.<eos> So, may the Lord bless you.
FCDA sent their names to the White House.<eos> - They're not there.<eos> - Just check the goddam list again.<eos> - Give me your bag - They must be there.<eos> Give me your bag, sweetie.<eos> - No, they're not on the list. I'm sorry.<eos> - Wait, wait...<eos> Let's go!<eos> Sir! Could you check it one more time?<eos> I put you on the list.
The Princess?<eos> Doctor, an assassination attempt...<eos> on the Count!<eos> Send in the doctor!<eos> I'm Jean de Siriex.<eos> I'm a French diplomat.<eos> Get this medicine, and send for a priest.<eos> I pray to you, as if to God Himself.<eos> Save his life.<eos> Let me go in with you.
- Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> On sleazing extra candy. Tears are key.<eos> Tears will normally get you the double-bagger.<eos> You can try the old "You missed me" routine, but it's risky.<eos> Only go there for chocolate.<eos> Understood?<eos> OK, troops.<eos> Let's move out.<eos> What did Mrs Davis give you?
I've seen this type before.<eos> They're children with stories of friendly vampires...<eos> - ..to comfort themselves in the dark.<eos> - Is that so bad?<eos> These people know nothing about vampires!<eos> What they are,... ..how they live, how they dress.<eos> I love a good diatribe, but I'm still curious why Ford, bestest friend of the Slayer,...<eos> - ..is hangin' with vampire wannabes.<eos> - Something's up with him. You're right.<eos> Sorry to beep you in the middle of stuff,...
Turn and slide.<eos> You don't turn and slide.<eos> You throw it out!<eos> I get tetanus shots every time I get dressed!<eos> We're not throwing it out.<eos> I built it with my own hands!<eos> How about we sell it?<eos> All right.<eos> But you'll have to tell them.<eos> Can we stick you in another cabinet?
Take care of yourself, okay?<eos> You too.<eos> I'm not the one who needs to sit on his helmet.<eos> - I'll call when I get a chance.<eos> - Bud?<eos> I don't suppose I could get a goodbye kiss, could I?<eos> I really don't think so.<eos> I love you.<eos> Gentlemen, ma'am, I'm Tim McGuss.<eos> Captain Hubbard is waiting for you on the Bridge.
Why would I wanna blame anyone?<eos> I'll go to the Comm. Room and get you those tapes.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I have to make a call anyway.<eos> Reprisal, this is Fryer.<eos> Two more North Korean frigates are entering the search area.<eos> Sea Star, Reprisal.<eos> Be advised two more North Korean warships are approaching.<eos> Continue salvage operation.<eos> We'll provide air coverage until service units reach you in 10 hours.
Damn.<eos> They've got Marzook on a phone from the plane.<eos> Mustapha.<eos> Lang.<eos> You killed a hostage after you said we had 15 minutes.<eos> My watch must be fast.<eos> If I do not speak to Marzook now, I will kill another patient.<eos> Don't kill anyone.<eos> I've got Marzook.<eos> Hang on, I'll connect you.
He's waiting for us.<eos> Enter.<eos> - Reporting as ordered, sir.<eos> - At ease.<eos> It seems the three of you had quite a day yesterday.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I was telling Major MacKenzie I spent the good part of my morning on the phone with a CNO, who in turn has been on the phone with the D.C. Police Department.<eos> Care to guess the topic of conversation?<eos> I thought not.<eos> What you probably didn't guess is I backed you a hundred percent.
Could you please give me a smile, please?<eos> - One smile.<eos> - Like her?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Exactly 24 million consequences.<eos> Lieutenant Commander Rabb and Major MacKenzie?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Welcome to the U.K.<eos> Jonathan Graham, R.U.C. I'm to accompany you to Belfast.
That's all.<eos> I wanna thank you gentlemen for volunteering to serve on the firing squad.<eos> Since we announced to the press that Groves chose this method, we've been swamped with phone calls from sharpshooters all over the country wanting to sign up.<eos> But the warden and I felt it best if we handled this internally.<eos> Warden?<eos> There hasn't been an execution by firing squad in this state since 1 872.<eos> Fortunately, Lenny Burrano worked in Utah before coming to Oswald.<eos> - Lenny?<eos> - Thank you, warden.<eos> Now, many people will tell you that firing squads are barbaric.
- Yeah.<eos> I heard what happened in the cafeteria.<eos> It's just gonna escalate.<eos> This place is fuelled by smoke.<eos> I know that Marlboros aren't gonna disappear.<eos> They're just gonna go underground like drugs.<eos> I said we have to enforce the new rules.<eos> I didn't say that I like them.<eos> Next item, Kareem Said.<eos> Now, he arrives today and I don't have to tell you what a potential powder keg this can be, not just because he blew up a white-owned warehouse in his community.
- No.<eos> - I do have one thing I can tell you.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Seventy-eight percent of the population at Oswald State Penitentiary are men of colour.<eos> The ratio is, at last count, one officer for every nine prisoners.<eos> We could take this prison anytime we want to.<eos> You could take it, but you wouldn't be able to keep it.<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> You telling me you intend to start a riot?<eos> What I'm telling you is, as of today I run OZ.
I tell you, Worf, war is much more fun when you're winning!<eos> Defeat makes my wounds ache.<eos> The replacements.<eos> I am General Martok.<eos> Welcome to the Rotarran.<eos> May you prove worthy of this ship and bring honour to her name.<eos> This is a glorious moment in the history of the Empire, a chapter that will be written with your blood.<eos> Fight well and our people will sing your praises for a thousand years.<eos> Fail and there will be no more songs, no more honour, no more Empire.<eos> Who hears the cry of the warrior calling you to glory?
If you could help, the physician in charge is waiting for you.<eos> Prepare a medkit. Include an osteo-regenerator.<eos> Yes, Doctor. I'll get the mobile emitter and inform the Captain.<eos> Doctor, wait. There's a problem with your program. What sort of problem?<eos> Something caused by the new subroutines you added. Is the Doctor all right?<eos> He might not be unless I can figure out what's going on.<eos> I need to run a complete analysis on all your subroutines while they're running.<eos> I'm sorry, Kes.<eos> Tell the physician I recommend he use the regenerator until Zahir is stabilized.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.
Suicide victims seldom make the fatal cut on the first try.<eos> - Seldom, but not always.<eos> Is that all you got?<eos> - No.<eos> Why was the phone off the hook when you got to the Sims' house?<eos> The wife took it off.<eos> I guess she didn't wanna be interrupted.<eos> Your incident report says the husband called the police after finding his wife dead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But if the phone was off the hook, how did he call you?

Tell me it's bull, as Agent Scully has, but it's as believable as any story I've heard.<eos> At least it's the only one that can't be refuted by the facts.<eos> Au right.<eos> There was one man who knew what brought this plane down.<eos> He knew it even before he got on the plane, but he got on anyway.<eos> He sat right here in this seat, 13-F.<eos> His name was Max Fennig_<eos> There are a number of possibilities for Max's suspicions,.__ _.but I believe he'd been followed for some time before he boarded Flight 549.<eos> And I believe he was followed onto this plane... _.by someone who wanted whatever it is Max had carried on board with him.<eos> The object that ultimately brought down this plane, the cause which has alluded you.
Excuse me, my good fellow.<eos> I think you'll find that this tomb is mine.<eos> Go ahead. Take your best shot.<eos> Eliminate him.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The last sight you'll ever see.<eos> My God...<eos> Fear not, ladies.<eos> I shall not go down without a fight.<eos> Did I not tell you that I was captain of my boxing team in my division?
- Yes.<eos> - I'll tell you how much money I made for you.<eos> - I didn't make any...<eos> - No, Craig.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Tell them you lost the money but it was a mistake, an accident.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't make any money for you.
I am Chief Roundcreek.<eos> It's a shame we grownups didn't have the courage to do what you young people have done.<eos> Thank you for giving us back our courage.<eos> And thank you for giving us new hope to heal the wound that's caused so much pain.<eos> To show our appreciation we would like to present you with a gift.<eos> -Whoa!<eos> -Cool!<eos> Eagle feathers are considered by my people to be the highest symbol of honour and courage given only to the greatest of warriors.<eos> Though you are not of our blood, we believe you deserve this recognition.<eos> Therefore I name you honorary Tiwanka warriors.
Okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eat. Go on!<eos> No problem.<eos> Mike here.<eos> Captain, I think you mean, "Get our asses down there, please."<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Hey, baby!<eos> Where's Howard?<eos> He's looking for you.
- We all will. It's a question of how and why.<eos> - I'm not a coward.<eos> I want what you want.<eos> But we need the nobles.<eos> - We need 'em?<eos> - Aye.<eos> What does that mean, to be noble?<eos> Your title gives you claim to Scotland's throne, but men don't follow titles.<eos> They follow courage.<eos> Our people know you.
I hear you have been given the rank of knight.<eos> I have been given nothing.<eos> God makes men what they are.<eos> God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?<eos> The executioner of the King's nephew, my husband's own cousin?<eos> York was the staging point for every invasion of my country.<eos> That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.<eos> Longshanks did far worse the last time he took a Scottish city.<eos> You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.<eos> See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.
- Leave us.<eos> Now.<eos> Let us talk plainly.<eos> You invade England.<eos> But you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply.<eos> The King desires peace.<eos> - Longshanks desires peace?<eos> - He declares it to me, I swear it.<eos> He proposes that you withdraw your attack.<eos> In return he grants you title, estates and this chest of gold which I am to pay to you personally.
- Hi, Mom.<eos> - Hi, darling.<eos> - Did you eat?<eos> - Yeah. I ate.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> How you doing?<eos> It didn't take you too long to get here.<eos> - We had fun.<eos> - Are you hungry?<eos> I got something for you.
The world... of appearances.<eos> I thought we had agreed on half a dozen.<eos> But you know it's becoming more and more difficult.<eos> People are suspicious.<eos> They've put up posters.<eos> In any case. this batch is as fresh as they come.<eos> Not one of them is over five years old.<eos> Listen.<eos> Let us have maybe a couple of hours... and we'll sort this thing out.<eos> Only the third eye... will enable you to enter... the world of appearances.
Tore the arse of my best employee, a poor orphan, just up from the boondocks, who cried her heart out in my arms. Fortunately she's in Finland, with a friend of mine who left his wife and daughters for her.<eos> A good girl, Rosarinho.<eos> Then he got involved with a child, caused a lot of talk, a scandal. Girl's father heard about it, he took the law into his own hands, and beat this fellow up.<eos> Bless him!<eos> A pity you're still alive!<eos> Had it been me, I'd have strangled you.<eos> Killed you like a mad dog.<eos> He's sick, a sexual pervert.<eos> He even drools when he eats ice-cream.<eos> You're not getting rid of me, I am condemning you to stay.
The screams of the victim deaden his pain.<eos> The act of killing makes him feel intensely alive.<eos> What he feels next is not guilt but disappointment.<eos> It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped.<eos> Maybe next time, it will be perfect.<eos> And as his determination builds to take another life he plans, in obsessive detail what props he'll bring what knots he'll tie.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> What turns you on?
Now, I'd like to ask you guys a favor.<eos> If you could all stand up, all the men in the room.<eos> Please indulge me.<eos> Come on, it's only fair, after all the time you've ogled us.<eos> Now, would everybody under 20 and over 35 have a seat.<eos> If you are of Asian or African-American descent, you may sit down.<eos> Kenny, turn that light on, please so we can get a good look at these guys.<eos> Ladies, what do you see?<eos> Some pretty cute guys, don't you think?<eos> If one of these fellas asked you out for a drink, you'd go.
Ammunition.<eos> Uh, I'd like some tobacco, please.<eos> Well, I may have one or two twists left.<eos> From my personal supply, you understand.<eos> For good friends only.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> You're William Blake.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> By the grace of the Lord Almighty.<eos> Sir, would it be presumptuous of me to ask you for... for your autograph?
I know, I know. It's lies, all lies.<eos> He means to frighten us into submission.<eos> Don't give in to him, milady.<eos> We'll fight, every last one of us.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not the yielding kind.<eos> Jacob.<eos> Milady?<eos> Take these good people in and give them food and drink.<eos> This evening, when you've rested, we shall all pray together for your village and for Lyonesse.<eos> God keep you safe, milady.
What road?<eos> Wherever a chance takes me.<eos> I have no plans.<eos> So you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?<eos> Yes.<eos> At the end of that hallway, there are two doors, one to the left, and one to the right.<eos> How will you decide which door to take?<eos> Left or right, it makes no difference.<eos> It's all chance.<eos> Then I hope chance leads you to the left, because it's the only way out.
You know I'm a man of my word.<eos> Don't make an enemy of me.<eos> I mean no harm to Camelot.<eos> You know the law we live by.<eos> And where is it written "Beyond Camelot live lesser people, people too weak to protect themselves, let them die"?<eos> Other people live by other laws, Arthur.<eos> Or is the law of Camelot to rule the entire world?<eos> There are laws that enslave men, and laws that set them free.<eos> Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just another robber tribe.<eos> Your fine words are talking you out of peace and into war.
The least I can do is give you your shirt.<eos> My lord.<eos> Tell me what you want and it's yours.<eos> I did what any man would have done.<eos> No, no.<eos> You risked your life for another.<eos> There is no greater love.<eos> You have deceived me, but now I know the truth.<eos> The truth is you care nothing for yourself.<eos> Well, look at you. No wealth, no home, no goal, just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
No!<eos> - Come out.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Lucky they're still alive.<eos> - Hold my arm. Hold my arm.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Come along, miss.<eos> Take my arm.<eos> I love you, milady.
Come along, miss.<eos> Take my arm.<eos> I love you, milady.<eos> - Yes, we're glad you're safe. - Thank you, Your Majesty.<eos> Food and water for you all.<eos> There's a step. Be careful.<eos> Child, all the bad men are gone now.<eos> Take my arm, child.<eos> It's all right, it's safe now.<eos> God bless you, sir. God bless you.
I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Never?<eos> Never.<eos> See, I know what I must do now.<eos> I never believed in anything before.<eos> But I do believe in Camelot.<eos> And I will serve it best by leaving.<eos> Tell the king I'll always remember that he saw the best in me.<eos> And what shall I tell myself?<eos> That there was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
Look at him.<eos> Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot. Ha!<eos> He's a man waking up from a dream.<eos> The strong rule the weak.<eos> That's how your God made the world.<eos> God makes us strong only for a while, so that we can help each other.<eos> My God makes me strong so I can live my life.<eos> Arthur says to you, "Serve one another."<eos> Well, when are you gonna start living for yourselves?<eos> Now, this is the freedom I bring you.
-Let me answer this one.<eos> Who am I talking to?<eos> Him or you?<eos> You can talk to me.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> Outside of "Freaks," it's none of your business what we do.<eos> Here it is right here.<eos> This is the project. "Mr. Lovejoy."<eos> I don't want you to think I'm putting something over on you.
Won't there be trouble if Section 9 butts in on Section 6's operation?<eos> That diplomat's a pretty well-known bastard.<eos> Even if they catch him there, all they can do is deport him.<eos> We're the only ones who can get our hands dirty.<eos> They're moving.<eos> Take us over to the extraction point.<eos> What?<eos> The police?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Who told you to open fire?
So we ask you now to remind certain of our young people the only way to get a new suit to go to the promenade with Margaret O'Herlihy who happens to be a Catholic, by the way is to work for it.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Are we gonna pray now, Daddy?<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> Maybe a trip to the woods hed'll straighten you out.<eos> Pretty soon you boys are gonna have to get out there and scratch.<eos> 'Cause you're not gonna get anywhere on your good looks-just ask those fellas.<eos> Charity's only gonna get you so far even with saints like your mother around.
No. No, don't!<eos> If I'd been president, they never would've killed me.<eos> Vice President Johnson, shown here being sworn in... Dick, are you gonna call?<eos> Bobby. Hmm?<eos> I'll go through Johnson. We'll be invited.<eos> This is a sad time for all people.<eos> I ask for your help.<eos> ...and are going to see Vietnam through to an honorable peace to defend an honored cause whatever the price, whatever the burden whatever the sacrifice that duty may require.<eos> Accordingly... I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president.<eos> Good night, and God bless all of you.
He's writing instructions to the frame-makers now.<eos> poor phoebe.<eos> She would not have forgotten him so soon.<eos> It was not in her nature.<eos> It's not for any woman who truly loved.<eos> Do you claim that for your sex?<eos> We do not forget you as soon as you forget us.<eos> We cannot help ourselves.<eos> We live at home... quiet...confined... and our feelings prey upon us.<eos> you always have business to take you back into the world.
Any problem with that?<eos> I was planning to kill you anyway.<eos> Gentlemen, the street is yours.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> All I hear from you weak cowards is how poor you are.<eos> How you can't afford my taxes, my protection.<eos> Yet somehow you've all managed to find the money to hire a professional gunfighter to kill me.<eos> Where's all this money coming from?<eos> What am I to think?<eos> If you've got so much to spare, I'm gonna have to take more off you.
Nacimiento, tell Yoshi to bring the Portobello.<eos> - You're quite a linguist.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I travelled a lot before I married Patrick.<eos> I was a stewardess.<eos> Now they call them flight attendants.<eos> Really? I bet I could still get your seat back in the upright position.<eos> Whenever they try to be funny, it comes out perverse or terrifying.<eos> - I see. - You'll get used to it.<eos> ...be sure to tell you that she misses you and sends all of you her love.
And why?<eos> Because we covet, nay, we lust after what is not ours.<eos> Be it for the rich land of our Indian brothers, be it for glory, for profits or for revenge.<eos> Need I read the secret of every heart?<eos> I will if you want. Yea, I will if you want. I will lay open the secrets before the eyes of God!<eos> What thou lusteth after is my enemy, sayeth the Lord God.<eos> For only I shall consume thee, only I shall fill thee up.<eos> If thou failest to heed my commandments, then my fist shall descend on thee like a stone!<eos> And thy sword shall cut thee into bloody parts, and even thy memories shall be sacrificed to the winds for all time!<eos> May God bless you, each and every one of you.
From the savages I have learned patience,<eos> Hester Prynne.<eos> Goody Gotwick, thank you.<eos> Reverend, allow me to introduce our newest boarder,<eos> Doctor Chilling...<eos> - Chillingworth.<eos> - Chillingworth.<eos> Good day, man.<eos> Good day, sir.<eos> What brings you to our colony, sir?
Goddamn screamer!<eos> It wanted to kill us.<eos> It can see us and touch us.<eos> I can"t tell what the signals say.<eos> It can talk.<eos> - He"s a fucking toaster.<eos> - That"s right.<eos> Pinocchio"s not a real little boy.<eos> - Why didn"t it try to kill us?<eos> - lt was tagging you.
No, he's pissing in our faces. We're just taking it like idiots.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement.<eos> He wouldn't just stop.<eos> So, what the fuck, man?<eos> He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece.<eos> We'll wait for his plea.<eos> My client says there are two more bodies. Two more victims, hidden away. He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies, but only Detective Mills and Somerset, only at 6:00 today.<eos> Why us?<eos> He says he admires you.
Yes, I believe he has.<eos> I wanted his mother's approval, but we loved each other so much.<eos> You must have seen how capable he is of making a woman attached to him.<eos> I cannot pretend it has not been hard on both of us.<eos> We can scarcely meet above twice a year.<eos> You seem out of sorts. Are you quite well?<eos> - I have not offended you?<eos> - I must know what you are saying.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> - What has so fascinated you? - Tell us all!
- I'll take you to Barton myself.<eos> - I confess, that is what I hoped.<eos> Marianne suffers cruelly.<eos> What pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.<eos> Perhaps...<eos> May I relate some circumstances which only a desire to be useful...<eos> You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby?<eos> When I quitted Barton last... No, I must go further back.<eos> No doubt...<eos> No doubt Mrs. Jennings has appraised you of certain events in my past.
Four wounded.<eos> The luck of the Irish.<eos> Major.<eos> Something you ought to see.<eos> Look at 'em.<eos> Your brave Irish deserters.<eos> The French believe there are two kinds of people in Spain.<eos> Those who are for them and those who are against.<eos> They've found you now, and they're wondering what you are.<eos> And until they find the answers, they'll treat you like an enemy which leaves you three choices.
You haven't seen Miranda, have you, sarge?<eos> Maybe she's run off with one of the Irish Company.<eos> They've nice uniforms. So they have.<eos> - Nice enough to tun a young girl's head.<eos> - She ain't like that, sarge.<eos> Don't tease him, Patrick.<eos> He's found his true love, sarge.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Yes, sarge, I have.<eos> Then God bless you, Perkins.
So bugger the King and his shilling!<eos> It's your last chance.<eos> I think it's your last chance to join us.<eos> Look at your men, Sharpe.<eos> The whole, horrible dirty bunch.<eos> Look at him there, the scaly licking his chops.<eos> Sergeant Rodd.<eos> Private Rodd.<eos> Deserter Rodd.<eos> When the provosts catch you. It'll be 200 hashes.
But I can't let you film everything we do here. I have to protect the privacy of my patients.<eos> But to answer your question, whether there was a woman here who thought she was Maria d'Avalos?<eos> I think there was, but it was years and years ago.<eos> She was an opera singer. But I didn't work here yet then.<eos> But the interesting thing is that we have a patient here who says that he is Carlo Gesualdo.<eos> And we have yet another patient who says he too is Carlo Gesualdo.<eos> I have to keep them apart.<eos> And I absolutely cannot allow them to meet one another.<eos> So here in our museum at Venosa Castle we have many interesting and very valuable artefacts.<eos> But there's one that'll certainly interest you. It is this disc here at the centre of the vitrine which most certainly belonged to Prince Carlo Gesualdo. It was his personal property.
-Woody, who's up there with ya?<eos> Woody?<eos> -What are you doing under the bed? -Nothin'.<eos> Nothin'.<eos> I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.<eos> Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.<eos> It's just a mistake!<eos> Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody.<eos> -Have you been replaced?<eos> -What did I tell you earlier?
The second Department of Defense burst, called Grable, was detonated at the same general area, and it was delivered by the Army's new artillery cannon.<eos> A 280mm projectile was fired and detonated over about the same blast area, with a yield of about 15 kilotons, at an altitude of about 500 feet.<eos> Now, the smaller yield, 15 kilotons at 500 feet, produced a great deal more damage than had the larger yield, Encore event, 27 kilotons at 2,800 feet.<eos> And that's because the smaller yield at the lower altitude produced a very abnormal waveform which we call a "precursor," which is very stong, dynamic winds which, to drag-sensitive targets, produces extensive damage.<eos> For instance, a Jeep at a given level on Encore may not have been damaged at all, but on Grable, with a precursor loading, that Jeep would be completely torn to pieces and thrown down the blast line distances like 500 feet.<eos> Well, there were many other peculiarities to those two shots, but it opened up a whole new vista of "how do you use nuclear weapons in a combat situation?"<eos> Common sense tells you this is dangerous and foolish.<eos> You wouldn't risk your neck in a trick like this.<eos> Common sense tells us that being shot out of a cannon is dangerous business.<eos> Common sense tells you not to be careless at an airfield with propellers and jet engines in action.
This incident pushed the dangers of fallout from nuclear weapons clearly into the public mind.<eos> Let's face it:<eos> the threat of hydrogen bomb warfare is the greatest danger our nation has ever known.<eos> Enemy jet bombers carrying nuclear weapons can sweep over a variety of routes and drop bombs on any important target in the United States.<eos> The threat of this destruction has affected our way of life in every city, town, and village from coast to coast.<eos> These are the signs of the times.<eos> Only in practice now; a rehearsal, a training exercise.<eos> But tomorrow, this siren may mean the real thing.<eos> And if you hear it, as you drive in your auto, as you sit in your office, or work at your bank, wherever you are, what will you do?<eos> What will happen to you?
Come on.<eos> Can we help you?<eos> It's just a tape.<eos> I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.<eos> We don't know anything about an Army of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.<eos> - Just want some information.<eos> - Didn't you hear me?<eos> Don't hurt her!<eos> Please, I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> Just do whatever he tells you to do.
You have nothing!<eos> I have nothing... but you... if you want that.<eos> My God... You lie so beautifully!<eos> I never lie!<eos> What are you doing, my... friend?<eos> Just talking.<eos> Talking?<eos> And you have to talk in the dark?<eos> The noise disturbed us.<eos> The noise disturbed you?
Yes!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen, cry quietly.<eos> You have what it takes.<eos> Maybe a month or two and you'll be in Rome, Cinecitta'<eos> So I don't say anything.<eos> Not a word, relax.<eos> Yes, OK.<eos> Scarlet, I've waited longer for you... than I've ever waited for any woman. Here's a soldier of the South who loves you!
Pulls them in, that's right. My grandson, Filippo, best looking boy in town... like me at his age.<eos> Make him like Rudolph Valentino, I'll make it worth your while. I can't promise anything. Movies are a mean business.<eos> I don't want to disappoint anybody.<eos> But I've got 19 years' experience... and one thing's for sure... if there's talent behind this face... not even God can stop him.<eos> Bordonaro, take one!<eos> Right profile. Left profile.<eos> Center profile.<eos> Action.<eos> Scarlet, I've waited longer for you... than I've ever waited for any woman.<eos> Here's a soldier of the South who loves you!
You're so beautiful!<eos> Your kind sir is, too.<eos> Don't call me your kind sir. You make me feel old.<eos> Open up. Open your legs.<eos> I won't hurt you.<eos> Be good. It won't hurt.<eos> Like it?<eos> People of Treportoni! Universalia Studios of Rome... extends its warmest greetings... to this beautiful land of Sicily.<eos> Men, women, young... old, children, hurry!<eos> Success awaits you!
Scarlet, do I have to wait for furlough to have a kiss?<eos> Our parents got married in 1923.<eos> A year later I was born on February 18.<eos> Mariano, killed by the mafia... we found him in a hay stack with his head bashed in.<eos> After all, tomorrow is another day.<eos> Should I do the music, too?<eos> They lined us up... machine guns pointed to kill us all.<eos> They asked if we'd fight at their side.<eos> We all said "no!"<eos> Here's a soldier of the south who loves you.
It was his will.<eos> - Keaton was Keyser Söze.<eos> - No.<eos> The kind of man who could wrangle men like Hockney and McManus.<eos> The kind of man who could engineer a line-up through all his contacts at NYPD.<eos> The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran!<eos> She was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.<eos> What do you think about Keaton now, Verbal?<eos> Edie?<eos> He used all of you to get him on that boat.
No lace, Mrs. Bennet, I beg you.<eos> But the man he brought with him!<eos> 'Mr. Darcy', as he calls himself, is not worth our concern, though he may be the richest man in Derbyshire.<eos> The proudest, the most horrid, disobliging...<eos> He slighted poor Lizzy, and flatly refused to stand up with her.<eos> Slighted my Lizzy, did he?<eos> I didn't care for him either, so it's of little matter.<eos> Another time, Lizzy, I would not dance with him if he should ask you.<eos> I believe, mom, I may safely promise you never to dance with Mr. Darcy.<eos> So none of the Hertfordshire ladies could please you, Mr. Darcy?
Mr. Bingley, did you not promise a ball in Netherfield when you were settled here?<eos> It will be a scandal if you don't keep your word.<eos> I am perfectly ready to keep my engagement.<eos> When your sister is recovered, you shall name the day of the ball, if you please.<eos> There, now, Lydia!<eos> That's a fair promise for you!<eos> That's generosity for you!<eos> That's what I call gentlemanly behaviour!<eos> Miss Eliza Bennet.<eos> Let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room.
I think it the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own poor children.<eos> Indeed, my dear, nothing can clear Mr Collins of the iniquitous crime of inheriting Longbourn, but if you listen to his letter, you may be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.<eos> "My dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father"<eos> "always gave me much uneasiness. And since I have had the misfortune to lose him..."<eos> "... to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach."<eos> There, Mrs Bennet."My mind, however, is now made up on the subject..."<eos> ...for, having received my ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh,<eos> whose bounty and beneficience has preferred me to the valuable rectory at Hunsford, where it's my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship.<eos> As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing ofpeace in all families within the reach of my influence. And on these grounds I flatter myself that my overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and will not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.<eos> I am, sir, keenly conscious of being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends.
Mr Collins has something to say to Lizzy!<eos> Dear Mamma, don't go.<eos> Mr Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say that anyone could not hear.<eos> Lizzy.<eos> I insist that you stay where you are and hear Mr Collins!<eos> Come, Kitty!<eos> Come along.<eos> Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, but your modesty adds to your other perfections.<eos> But you can hardly doubt the object of my discourse, however your feminine delicacy may lead you to dissemble.<eos> For, as almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life!
How can you defend yourself on that subject?<eos> Such interest in that gentleman's concerns!<eos> Who that knows of his misfortunes, can help feeling an interest? His misfortunes!<eos> Yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed!<eos> And of your infliction!<eos> You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, and yet you can treat his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule!<eos> And this is your opinion of me?<eos> My faults by this calculation are heavy indeed.<eos> Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by the confession of the scruples long prevented my forming serious design on you.<eos> Had I concealed my struggles and flattered you.
Let him come in and explain himself!<eos> No.<eos> You will forgive me.<eos> You'll forgive me.<eos> Darcy, you are unwell?<eos> I'm very well, thank you, but I have a pressing matter of business.<eos> You'll forgive me.<eos> Make my apologies to Lady Catherine, Fitzwilliam.<eos> To Miss Elizabeth Bennet.<eos> Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, that it contains any repetition of those sentiments or offers which were this evening so disgusting to you.
I am well, Charlotte.<eos> I've stayed indoors too long.<eos> Fresh air and exercise is all I need.<eos> The woods around Rosings are so beautiful at this time of year.<eos> Miss Bennet!<eos> Mr. Darcy.<eos> I've been walking the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.<eos> Will you do me the honour of reading this letter?<eos> This, madam, is a faithful narrative of my dealings with Mr. Wickham, and for its truth I can appeal to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who knows every particular of these transactions.<eos> I know not under what form of falsehood Mr. Wickham imposed himself on you, but I hope you'll acquit me of cruelty towards him.
Oh, Lizzy!<eos> A great many, indeed.<eos> We have dined nine times at Rosings!<eos> Oh, how much I shall have to tell!<eos> How much I shall have to conceal.<eos> You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.<eos> Lizzy!<eos> Lizzy!<eos> To see your faces when you looked up!<eos> You didn't expect we'd come to meet you.
If you please, ma'am!<eos> There are two gentlemen and a lady waiting upon you in the parlour.
-Bye, Miyo!<eos> -Bye, Miyo!<eos> Bye, Miyo.<eos> My little chicken pot pie.<eos> So you are the grandsons of Mori Shintaro.<eos> Hey, how come you didn't speak English to us at the tournament?<eos> In front of the other people?<eos> They would not understand us.<eos> It would be rude.<eos> Did you bring the dagger your grandfather gave you?
No, no, no!<eos> Not that way.<eos> The window, the window.<eos> Go on.<eos> The window.<eos> I'll be out in a minute, Nick.<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> Warner! Hello, Warner.<eos> - It was a lovely performance.<eos> - Oh, thank you very much.
-I want to apologize.<eos> And wherever your kids are...<eos> ... they'recrazynot towant youthere .<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like you said .<eos> One day at a time.<eos> Phoenix.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Jason McThune will escort you to Phoenix.
How could you tell him we're churchpeople?<eos> - What the hell is going on?<eos> - They were caught in the act of spying. Oh, man.<eos> Please, please. You can't come in here. Calm down.<eos> Hand them over to us. We'll drag them out and shoot them.<eos> This embassy's United States territory. No one will be dragged out and shot.<eos> Leave the premises at once. This is an extreme violation of international conduct.<eos> I'm Axel Magee. I'm in charge of this embassy while the ambassador's away. Now...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave immediately.<eos> Guns or no guns, if you don't go, Mr. Kilroy will throw you out.
I... feel like I've just, uh... got to know you, and now you're going.<eos> You know, if you're ever in Newark, you have my father's card.<eos> You could always, I don't know, drop by.<eos> The way things are going, that... - could be my next career stop.<eos> I can't understand you. They've been so nice to us here. How could you stick the towels in your suitcase?<eos> I was a deprived child. I told you.<eos> - Give me... - Oh, wonderful. Now he takes one.<eos> Are you sure it's safe to go out there?<eos> Mrs. Hollander, I assure you, it's been carefully coordinated.<eos> Mr. Krojack will be with you till the moment you board the plane.
Mrs. Hollander, I assure you, it's been carefully coordinated.<eos> Mr. Krojack will be with you till the moment you board the plane.<eos> Did you take your hair dryer our of Mr. Burns' office?<eos> Did you hurt yourself? We came to say good-bye and to wish you good luck.<eos> - It's a pity you're leaving.<eos> - Well, look, if you ever need a job... I know a lot of people in New Jersey who'd appreciate your kind of cooking.<eos> And don't worry about the Board of Health, 'cause they'll never catch you.<eos> I may as well tell you, Mr. Hollander, that the veal you had last night... was eel, and you cleaned your plate.<eos> Look in the vase next to the dining room table.<eos> God bless you. You have made my life richer.
You know, you'll get hungry again very soon.<eos> Soon after Hong Qi was here, those thieves returned to the village again.<eos> Before I took him to the villagers...<eos> I bought him a pair of shoes.<eos> It's because there's quite a difference in the fee paid... To a shoeless swordsman and one with shoes.<eos> So you think ten taels of silver is too much?<eos> Well, you can always hire some cheaper guys,<eos> There are a few of them, sitting outside. Pay them a few bucks and they will lump on the offer.<eos> But can you trust a poor chan... Who can't even afford shoes?<eos> What if the horse thieves give him... a poundig and come after you?
Forgive me, both of you. It's impossible.<eos> I cannot.<eos> Come, Benedict.<eos> You're tearing me apart, Carlo.<eos> To protect my love, I must crush my feelings.<eos> To hell with those rats!<eos> I'm so tired. I am so tired!<eos> Too much pride.<eos> Don't despise your music, Maestro.<eos> Who let you in?
Do you realize the scandal we will create?<eos> A Handel opera performed at the Nobles theater!<eos> It's unheard of! . Incredible!<eos> How could I have let all this happen?<eos> Finally, Farinelli... what rendered us enemies for so many years... will be resolved tonight.<eos> It's time to settle our account before God.<eos> Do you remember the opera... that your brother promised you when you were boys?<eos> Do you remember, Farinelli, with what emotion he spoke of it?<eos> Did you ever ask yourself... whether it was to soothe the pain of your castration... or to still his howling conscience?<eos> It's time you faced the truth... that has haunted you since childhood.
Castrato! Castrato!<eos> Carlo, please!<eos> He'll go crazy!<eos> Tell him you love him. Go ahead.<eos> Go.<eos> I can't.<eos> Your brother needs you, and so do I. I need you, too.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I sacrificed everything for this love.<eos> I know it's senseless... but I love you.
It's a life of sacrifice, but someone's got to do it.<eos> The central nervous system and the brain are as complicated a set of organs as you are ever likely to encounter.<eos> Mr. Frankenstein, the incision is yours.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Mr. Clerval, you may remove the cranial lid.<eos> "Henry is still struggling to pass anatomy."<eos> - I was always terrible at anatomy.<eos> - I'm learning a great deal.<eos> "Prof. Waldman is remarkable.<eos> God bless you, Victor."
What does she want?<eos> Chocolate?<eos> Some kind of goddamn fruit drink?<eos> What do we look like, waiters?<eos> Are we waiters?<eos> We want to be there!<eos> ...charity or a speech. Got it!<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I can't do three more years of this.<eos> I told you never to bring a gun in this room.
He's a great kid.<eos> And some kids don't live to get this age, you know.<eos> That's another thing to be proud about - that, you know, it's his 18th birthday, he lived... and to get to see 18, that's good.<eos> I wanna tell you that I love you very much.<eos> I'm very proud of you.<eos> It seems like I was 18 just yesterday.<eos> Here. happy birthday.<eos> I love you.<eos> - happy birthday!<eos> - I love you too.!
What did I tell you?<eos> I knew the Japanese forces would--<eos> Lives were lost this time.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> You know the Japanese soldiers are responsible for this.<eos> I knew there'd be killing.<eos> I tried to tell.<eos> No one listens to me.<eos> Chen Zhen, he was the real hero.<eos> Let me tell you.
A private nature? That's a public office you hold, isn't it, Sheriff?<eos> "There came a low hiss. and Rikki Tikki Tavi jumped back."<eos> "Then out of the grass rose the head and spread hood..." "lt was Nag the big black cobra..." Don't you like this story?<eos> The Germans broke through.<eos> The British are trapped in Belgium.<eos> And this paper's a week old.<eos> - I speak German.<eos> I'd be an officer.<eos> -And lead boys to the slaughter.<eos> - Your men worshipped you.
Oh, I'm sorry ...<eos> - No, please.<eos> Come in.<eos> A newspaper published two of my stories, and they want more.<eos> This is wonderful !<eos> "The Daily Volcano"?<eos> "The Sinner's Corpse" ...<eos> by Joseph March.<eos> Lunatics ... vampires...<eos> This interests you?
We're taking her home with us.<eos> Melissa?<eos> Oh, you mean Mouse.<eos> Well, I'm afraid you're mistaken about that.<eos> You see, Mouse is home, and so are you.<eos> Or hadn't you figured that out yet?<eos> This place is not a home.<eos> Oh, but it is.<eos> That's why I let you make it all the way up here to the inner sanctum, the very threshold of infinity.<eos> A river of holy water wouldn't help you now.
Come on, kids.<eos> We'll walk around to the taxi stand.<eos> Taxi?<eos> What for?<eos> We're going home. No.<eos> We're going to see Boogie. You promised.<eos> Please, Grace, try to understand.<eos> I don't want to listen to any more of your lies.<eos> I hate you!<eos> I hate you both!
The bit of herring in the skirt pocket...<eos> That's from "Degrees". It's when Mrs. d'Oneiras breaks off with him.<eos> The middle of the book.<eos> Not "Degrees".<eos> "Stairways", Inspector.<eos> "Stairways", chapter three,<eos> "The return of the Druze".<eos> Giving a false identity is very risky, Leonardo Da Vinci, old prick!<eos> Prince Cosimo's speech, before laying the tiles?<eos> "That's why I followed you here, and that's why this park if full of kneeling men..."
Unity is what they want, so set the example.<eos> - You came for the wedding?<eos> - No.<eos> That Margot is an evil whore.<eos> The wedding shames us all.<eos> Henry de Bourbon, King of Navarre, do you take Marguerite de Valois as your wife?<eos> I do.<eos> Marguerite de Valois, do you take Henry de Bourbon as your husband?<eos> Marguerite, do you take...<eos> In the name of God, of the Son, and His Holy Church, I join you in holy matrimony.
- Whose?<eos> - The peasant's!<eos> Your mother calls me that.<eos> If I live, I will be King.<eos> My brother is King.<eos> The other two will succeed him.<eos> And then their children.<eos> Your chances are slim.<eos> Yours are too.<eos> They will not protect you.
You murderers!<eos> You want us dead!<eos> Make way for the King!<eos> God will punish you!<eos> Is that your peace!<eos> Make way for the King!<eos> Justice will be done!<eos> Our brethren will come from all over to avenge us!<eos> Speak to them.<eos> Do not call for revenge, thank God who looks over you.
Make way for the King!<eos> God will punish you!<eos> Is that your peace!<eos> Make way for the King!<eos> Justice will be done!<eos> Our brethren will come from all over to avenge us!<eos> Speak to them.<eos> Do not call for revenge, thank God who looks over you.<eos> Your leader is safe. It is only a light wound.<eos> I will prove my loyalty, a ship awaits to take you to England.
I brought another King.<eos> A happy one, with no crown.<eos> Come, Henry.<eos> Take his hand.<eos> Hold it... It's the hand of a brother.<eos> Without him our child would be an orphan.<eos> I can eat without checking my food here!<eos> You won't say anything? Never?<eos> She'd kill them!<eos> Catherine loves you.
Drive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You fellas are probably busy.<eos> You can just drop me off anywhere... You're Dr. Roy Tam, a professor in the science department at N.Y.U. Yes.<eos> I've saved your life, Roy Tam.<eos> It now belongs to me. It does?<eos> You'll become one of my agents... like dozens of others all over the world.<eos> Could I, uh... ask my wife about this?<eos> No!<eos> Mr. Shrevnitz here will instruct you... in the way in which I will contact you... should I require your help.
Captain Sharpe and I have met You're late sir<eos> And I cannot abide unpunctuality.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late, my lord.<eos> The inspection of the rocket battery ran to a full hour.<eos> I am not happy you did not get me my horses, Sharpe.<eos> Do you think there may be something in these rockets, Sharpe?<eos> No as to accuracy, sir<eos> But they play merry hell with the morale of poorly-led men, sir.<eos> - The sound is shocking<eos> - Scared you, did they?
- Don't you start!<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I'll kill the Marqués.<eos> And when I find his bloody Marquesa, I'll kill hen<eos> - Of course you will, sir.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> Major Sharpe, sir.<eos> Captain.<eos> I trust you're not going ahead with this duel, sir.<eos> The sight of Spanish blood upset you, does it?
I want my money.<eos> An advance. Small token of my family's goodwill.<eos> Token?<eos> Token.<eos> Listen to me, boy.<eos> You know what the Dark Ages are?<eos> The Dark Ages are what I brought the León family out of.<eos> I computerized your operation.<eos> I streamlined your security.<eos> I dragged you into the 20th century.
You still refuse to accept... my godhood?<eos> Keep your own God!<eos> In fact, this might be a good time to pray to him.<eos> For I beheld Satan, and he fell from heaven... like lightning!<eos> Bison, you're off the air! Warning!<eos> Energy field unstable.<eos> This'll take one minute.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> We're the rescue team. We'll take you to safety. Head up the stairs.
That car wash robbed itself.<eos> We were at the park all day.<eos> They didn't have a shred of evidence, 'cept for our fingerprints.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oh. You don't wanna read that, Ma.<eos> That's a real heartbreaker.<eos> - Yeah, Ma. That's wicked bad.<eos> - Mm.<eos> "Dear Dave and Alvin. It's been five years since I've seen my daughter.<eos> As I told you before, she refuses to visit me here.
He brought some guests.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Think he'll remember us?<eos> - Can I take your bag?<eos> This is Mrs. Anderson.<eos> These guys had an accident up the road. I decided to bring 'em over here.<eos> Oh.<eos> I remember you from the bank this morning.<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to come off like I'm interrogating you... but the bank was robbed this afternoon... - by three men.
- It's not?<eos> - No, it's not... especially when all this money's at stake.<eos> Bill, would you, uh-- would you please pass me the giblet gravy?<eos> Thank you. Oh.<eos> There's some scallions in there.<eos> You know, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson... I wanted to say my appreciation for your hospitableness.<eos> Heh heh! 'Cause I love these giblets. Look at that.<eos> Scallions too.<eos> But anyway...<eos> I just certainly hope we haven't exposed ourselves upon you.
And a pirate.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - You as Rapunzel.<eos> Well, I mean, come on.<eos> Not that... Well, you know...<eos> Actually, I don't see myself in tights.<eos> I would rather not be a storybook character if possible.<eos> Today is Halloween.<eos> Yesterday, I could have got you Bill and Hillary.<eos> Let this be a lesson to you.
Where would it hurt?<eos> I really like that.<eos> Well I'm going to tell Jordan.<eos> Rayanne!<eos> Jordan !<eos> I'm going to tell Jordan.<eos> Could you get us in?<eos> Our friend's in there, he's got my keys.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> So what, they wouldn't let you in?
Ask Rickie, it was wicked.<eos> It was--<eos> - Oh, hey girlfriend !<eos> - Hey Angela!<eos> Ask Angela, she was there.<eos> Angela, tell her--<eos> We hung out and these guys tried to pick them up.<eos> - It was totally wicked, am I right?<eos> - And the cops came.<eos> I am telling you, we had a time.
Do you have any idea, how much time and effort I've already put into this?<eos> - Mom?<eos> - And it's going to be fun.<eos> And you haven't even given it a chance.<eos> - What is it, honey?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I mean, okay, I'll do it.<eos> Who taught you, please, who taught you to hate the texture of your hair?<eos> Who taught you to hate the color of your skin... to such extent that you bleach, to get like the white man?

The computer's engaged the magnetic seal.<eos> I can't override it.<eos> Ops to Sisko.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Commander, what is going on down there?<eos> We just got a recorded message from Gul Dukat regarding some worker revolt in the ore processing facility?<eos> We saw the same message.<eos> It seems we've tripped some kind of automated security program the Cardassians left.<eos> We're locked in.<eos> Oh, we'll beam you out of there.
You Cardassians do hold grudges.<eos> Seven years ago, Natima and I had a lover's quarrel and...<eos> Well, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> But Professor Lang isn't.<eos> I find your loyalty to her extremely touching.<eos> If she says we're not to talk to you, we won't.<eos> I understand.<eos> She's your teacher. You're her students.<eos> You have to listen.<eos> If you don't want to talk to the only person who can get you off this station, that's fine with me.
Why would shape-shifters need a door?<eos> Kira to computer.<eos> Scan the area dead ahead of me for 100 meters.<eos> Unable to penetrate due to interference.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> After you.<eos> Look out.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
Whatever you do to them you're going to have to do to me.<eos> They are free to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The next time, I promise you, we will not be so generous.<eos> Major...<eos> Constable.<eos> What happened to the Rio Grande?<eos> The last thing I remember is collapsing the wormhole.<eos> The last thing I remember is being shot by some Jem'Hadar soldier.<eos> I'm sure it all seemed very real but the truth is you've been held in this room since the Jem'Hadar brought you here from the Defiant.
When my doctor investigated it, she discovered what you had done.<eos> Now he'll never pay the ransom.<eos> Shut up!<eos> There was no ransom.<eos> All he was interested in was vengeance.<eos> DaiMon, is this true?<eos> He's not a daimon!<eos> He was stripped of command.<eos> They had no right to do that to me!<eos> He lied to you, so you'd help him in his plan.
He's not a daimon!<eos> He was stripped of command.<eos> They had no right to do that to me!<eos> He lied to you, so you'd help him in his plan.<eos> The Enterprise is closing in on your position.<eos> If you let the two of us go, they won't attack you.<eos> They won't attack us with you on board.<eos> They will cripple your ship and keep you here until the Ferengi authorities arrive.<eos> You've got a lot of explaining to do.<eos> Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you.
Southern Crescent to Red Crescent.<eos> We got a downed plane at camp perimeter.<eos> We have nothing in the sky at this time.<eos> We got something down here.<eos> We're gonna check it out.<eos> Medevac One, this is Red Crescent.<eos> Southern Crescent reports a downed aircraft in their area.<eos> It's the Grand Ole Opry on WSM Radio 650.<eos> Brought to you by Goody's Headache Powder.<eos> When the night's been too long and the party's been too hearty, Goody's Headache Powder straightens you right out. You have my word on that.
- He's burning up.<eos> - What is it?<eos> An infection or a toxic reaction.<eos> We've gotta get him to a hospital.<eos> - I'll get a stretcher.<eos> - We can'tjust leave Trepkos.<eos> Give me the shortwave.<eos> This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker team.<eos> Come in, Search and Rescue.<eos> I'll get O'Neil and meet you at the landing site.
But we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.<eos> All right. lf there are no objections, bail is set at $100,000... to be deposited directly into the clerk's probation account.<eos> My God!<eos> What is it?<eos> My God!<eos> My God! What is it?<eos> What is it?<eos> How much more will it take for you to believe?<eos> The Lord has testified against me!<eos> Does a serpent have to bite you all on the ass till you understand? !
Besides which, police and coroner's report make no mention of it.<eos> We're going to have to take a look at the body ourselves.<eos> The body's with the reservation authorities.<eos> We're supposed to get in touch with Sheriff Charlie Tskany.<eos> Excuse me, we're not from around here.<eos> We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.<eos> Anyone know Charlie Tskany?<eos> Go home, FBI.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I could smell you a mile away.
But I need help so much more.<eos> There are so many people already to tell you what to do.<eos> I think they're all a little angry with me for setting up for myself.<eos> Still, your family can advise you, show you the way.<eos> Is New York such a labyrinth?<eos> I thought it was all straight up and down, like Fifth Avenue.<eos> All the cross streets numbered, and big honest labels on everything.<eos> Everything is labelled, but everybody is not.<eos> Then I must count on you for warnings, too.<eos> All the older women like and admire you.
Well, not if the woman has appearances in the least degree against her.<eos> Has exposed herself by any unconventional behaviour to offensive insinuations and...<eos> Yes, so my family tells me.<eos> Our family.<eos> You'll be my cousin soon.<eos> And you agree with them?<eos> What could you possibly gain that would make up for the scandal?<eos> My freedom.<eos> But aren't you free already?<eos> It's my job to help you see things the way the people who are fondest of you see them, all your friends and relations.
- You do help me.<eos> Good night, cousin.<eos> Miss Molly, for mercy's sake, don't cry so bitterly!<eos> - Forget what I've done!<eos> - On one condition.<eos> I accept it, whatever it may be.<eos> - Never speak a word of love to me again.<eos> - Never.<eos> On my honour.<eos> Heaven bless you.
Yes, but I can't feel unhappy when you're here.<eos> - I shan't be here long.<eos> - I know.<eos> Ellen, if you really wanted me to come if I'm really to help you you must tell me what you're running from.<eos> Is he what you were running from?<eos> - Or what you expected?<eos> - I didn't know he was here.<eos> Hello, Beaufort.<eos> This way.<eos> Madame Olenska was expecting you.
I've felt a difference in you, especially since our engagement.<eos> Since our engagement?<eos> If it's false, then it won't hurt to discuss it.<eos> If it's true, then we should discuss it.<eos> You might have made a mistake.<eos> If I'd made a mistake, would I be here asking you to hurry our marriage?<eos> I don't know, you might.<eos> It would be one way to settle the question.<eos> In Newport, two years ago, before we were promised everyone said there was someone else for you.<eos> I even saw you with her once, sitting together on a veranda at a dance.
Time to give her up for another woman?<eos> If I want to.<eos> - It's very noble.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And it's ridiculous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because there is no other woman?<eos> No.<eos> Because I don't mean to marry anyone else.<eos> This other woman, does she love you, too?
Perhaps they might have another time alone somewhere.<eos> But he could not live without seeing her.<eos> Mr. Archer, I think?<eos> Yes.<eos> My name is Rivi�re.<eos> - I dined with you in Paris last year.<eos> - Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't quite recall.<eos> Quite all right.<eos> I had the advantage.<eos> I saw you in Boston yesterday.
- All right.<eos> - I pledge...<eos> - I agree.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - I'm in...<eos> - Me, too.<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you just promise, if you eat me, that you clean your plates?<eos> God bless you all.
- Scientific fact.<eos> Anyway, I've figured out a way to make it work for me.<eos> I call it "The Gaze."<eos> You look into a woman's eyes, and you think exactly what you want her to do for you.<eos> You're an actor?<eos> Oh my God, he's an actor!<eos> In 12 days, I have a gigantic performance I'm doing in Tucson.<eos> Maybe you'd like to come and see me?<eos> It's an audition.<eos> - What have we seen you in?
I made some coffee for you.<eos> - Great, thanks.<eos> Did you fuck her?<eos> What?<eos> My mother. Did you fuck her?<eos> No.<eos> I can smell her on you.<eos> You're not the first, did you know that?<eos> Could I have some milk?<eos> She's had a lot of young ones like you, eats you up like chocolates.
Even the king was weeping.<eos> No matter how resourceful you are... you can't fight fate.<eos> The king had once been all-powerful, but in the end... all he had left was one woman and one horse.<eos> He tried to get his steed to run away, but it wouldn't go.<eos> He wanted his concubine to flee, but she stayed too.<eos> For the very last time, Concubine poured wine for her king... and danced for him with a sword... then cut her throat with it, faithful to the king unto death.<eos> There's a lesson in this story for all of us... that each person is responsible for his or her own fate.<eos> My courage is renowned I've fallen on bad times Yet even my horse Won't run away to save itself<eos> If it won't run away What can I do<eos> Old Man Zhang has commissioned you to hire an opera troupe. You're like a fairy godmother to us.
The people of the liberated areas are all very happy.<eos> Mrs. Duan!<eos> Where were you?<eos> A meeting.<eos> A meeting?<eos> Xiaolou, the whole troupe's come.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Quick!<eos> Ah, a costume change!<eos> Thank you all for coming to see me.
Anyone could.<eos> Anyone could just show up.<eos> Come on, there's no one.<eos> Just us three.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Come on, you'll enjoy it.<eos> It's not a question of wanting to go or not.<eos> It's much stranger than that.<eos> What I really feel like doing is standing here and watching. If you change your mind, come around.<eos> Watching while the two of you leave me and disappear into a landscape that I'm about to photograph.
You look like a schmuck.<eos> He's all right.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Call me if there's a war.<eos> Move him out.<eos> You're on.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Mr. President?<eos> President Mitchell!<eos> God bless you!
is that the manager?<eos> Could I speak to him, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> Rick, a customer would like to speak to you.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like some breakfast.<eos> We stopped serving breakfast.<eos> I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.<eos> Sheila told me you stopped... .<eos> Why am I calling you by first names?
How are you?<eos> Where's the dog?<eos> He's dead.<eos> -What is it?<eos> -We need to ask you some questions.<eos> Just a few questions, ma'am.<eos> What kind of questions?<eos> Do you have a warrant?<eos> You invited us in.<eos> Now I'm inviting you out.
Madame de Fanfan's honor is as precious... as my family jewels.<eos> Back! Contriver of vile verse!<eos> Foul-mouthed villain!<eos> Horrid Hell-hound!<eos> Flee, flea!<eos> if cowards had horns, you'd shame an antelope!<eos> Your Lordship.<eos> spare your chest his sword, for my virtue is... questionable.<eos> Madame!<eos> If a thousand soldiers pounced you. Pitilessly. You'd still be a white lily to me.
It's the tickle monster! It's the tickle monster.<eos> Ow, what are you doing?<eos> Daddy just cracked his elbow.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Breakfast is ready!<eos> - Waking you up.<eos> - Who told you to wake me up?
Daddy just cracked his elbow.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Breakfast is ready!<eos> - Waking you up.<eos> - Who told you to wake me up?<eos> - Mommy did! - Mommy did!<eos> Why did she tell you to wake me up?
Thanks.<eos> And now... we proudly present the Willy Show!<eos> Go get them!<eos> [CROWD CLAPPING]<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... presenting the superstar orca of Northwest Adventure Park... let's hear it for Willy!<eos> [SQUEALS]<eos> This could be big.<eos> This could be big.<eos> And this is Willy's friend Jesse.<eos> Jesse and Willy have a special show for you.
- That's gonna be hell.<eos> - Maybe that's what this is, Milo.<eos> - Well, I guess we better wake him up and say good-bye. - Wait!<eos> Thomas.<eos> Thomas.<eos> - Sweetie, Thomas?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, goodness, you are such a big boy.<eos> [Harrison] We love you, Thomas.<eos> I love you too.
All right.<eos> We're gonna work something out. We're gonna work something out.<eos> I am in such trouble. I have no idea how to explain what just happened in there.<eos> You were in a car accident.<eos> The doctors mistakenly prescribed... morphine and Percodan... causing temporary... uh, ha-hallucinations.<eos> Percodan and morphine, right.<eos> - Could that happen?<eos> - [Harrison] I have no idea.<eos> - [Milo] Turn the page! - [Thomas] Okay.<eos> So this guy takes you to heaven on a bus? A bus.
- Table 2C? Yes. How long?<eos> Quite a while.<eos> They've been served already.<eos> Don't give them a check.<eos> Go order two more dishes for them.<eos> General Tao Chicken and pan-fried whole fish. I'm going over.<eos> - Commander! - Old Chen!<eos> What a coincidence!<eos> America is so big and we still run into each other in a restaurant!<eos> I recognized you as soon as I came in. You're eating?
Commander, this is my restaurant.<eos> Your restaurant?<eos> It's my third son's.<eos> But what is his, is mine. Congratulations!<eos> It's a beautiful restaurant.<eos> So, Old Chen, you finally made it.<eos> If it weren't for you and the Commander, I would be nothing.<eos> Chen has a restaurant, but Old Chang doesn't.<eos> You ate so little?<eos> I ordered two more dishes for you.
Leary didn't take it too well.<eos> - We've not been able to locate him.<eos> - We can work together on this.<eos> - Wouldn't that be refreshing?<eos> - We have fingerprints and photos.<eos> - These are at least 15 years old.<eos> - He's camera-shy.<eos> He'll be in disguise, anyway.<eos> We need photo alterations, Sam.<eos> What I'm about to show you is highly classified.
Get that fucking scum off my floor.<eos> They must know they've made a mistake.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> The proof of our innocence must be there in the evidence.<eos> We have to fight 'em to get an appeal.<eos> I'll speak to Father Wilson.<eos> Speak to everybody.<eos> We'll write letters from in here.<eos> Start a campaign.<eos> Have they been treating you all right?
Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth.<eos> - She's right.<eos> -Hold on.<eos> We don't know this is true.<eos> - This is just a theory.<eos> -Yeah, but it's a great theory.<eos> - A great theory.<eos> - Everything fits together.<eos> I think it's great.<eos> When I come back from the ladies' room, I'll tell you how to trap him.
There is no comfort for me, fate promises me nothing but grief!<eos> The crazy disgraceful old man!<eos> Whether I Iike it or not I must leave my home and parents<eos> Without him life is no life and death will be better<eos> calm yourself!<eos> The Hetman is powerful, the hetman is strong!<eos> I do not fear your power<eos> I swear by God and truth I will not give my darling up to you!<eos> Mazeppa is fearsome and strong. He is Hetman, ruler of Ukraine!<eos> With his mighty strength he will crush you in the dust
- This is Amytal.<eos> - You've heard of it? - Yeah.<eos> - It's a sedative. - It's good.<eos> - You'll sleep.<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> - Something to help you rest. - To help me rest.<eos> Okay? Okay.<eos> You're awfully pretty when you smile.<eos> Here.<eos> Let me help you out.
God keep you still in that mind, so some gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face.<eos> Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such a face as yours were.<eos> You are a rare parrot teacher.<eos> A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<eos> I would my horse had the speed of your tongue.<eos> Keep your way, in God's name.<eos> I have done.<eos> You always end with a jade's trick.<eos> I know you of old.<eos> Signior Claudio, Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
Masters, it is proved already that you are little better than false names.<eos> How answer you for yourselves?<eos> Marry, sir, we say we are none.<eos> You.<eos> Sir, I say to you we are none.<eos> - Have you writ down they are none?<eos> - You go not the way to examine.<eos> You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.<eos> Let the watch come forth.<eos> I charge you, in the prince's name, accuse these men.
Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, the offender did call me "ass".<eos> I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment.<eos> I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.<eos> Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth, and I praise God for you.<eos> There's for thy pains.<eos> God save the foundation!<eos> Go.<eos> I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.<eos> I leave with your worship an arrant knave, which I beseech you to correct yourself, for the example of others.<eos> God restore you to health.
Yes, they protect the people.<eos> - From these artifacts?<eos> - It's why the Library exists.<eos> So magical items stay in the hands of the people who comprehend them.<eos> You mean a failed academic, a cowboy, a janitor, and a crook?<eos> Clearly you don't understand these people or what they do.<eos> - But do you?<eos> - Of course, they're my...<eos> Yes, I trust them.<eos> These Librarians, they've never lied to you about anything?
And our bodies.<eos> Where's your wife?<eos> She's in the chapel with the Queen.<eos> Sad, really!<eos> No amount of prayer will do anything for that face.<eos> Is that the best you've got?<eos> My God, the way you've changed!<eos> You've become coarser.<eos> She had you nailed from the start.<eos> She's transformed you before my very eyes.
Two-body problem is high school math, dude.<eos> I need to get...<eos> Hi.<eos> I see you remembered your shoes.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm Liam.<eos> Jillian.<eos> So you're not MIT.<eos> Oh, is it that obvious, or should I wear a dunce cap so people know?<eos> I just mean that, you know, I haven't seen you around. And that event was students and faculty only.
So who are you?<eos> Me, I'm... I'm just a nobody.<eos> That's a lot of tuxedo for a nobody.<eos> All right, you got me.<eos> I'm Darius's new head of security.<eos> More dangerous with weapons or just your bare hands?<eos> You don't want to test it, trust me.<eos> I'm Amanda.<eos> Liam.<eos> What brings you here, Amanda?
Or maybe they haven't even figured that part out yet.<eos> Why did you bring me here, Darius?<eos> If I can expedite production, make a dozen RIVAs or more, instead of 160 people, maybe I can save thousands.<eos> But I need access to information and resources that only a few people in the government have.<eos> I need an inside man.<eos> Or woman, as they say.<eos> You're asking me to divert resources, spy on my government, commit treason for some insane narcissistic suicide mission?<eos> The only suicide mission is wearing blinders, Grace.<eos> Harris assured me that they...<eos> Harris will trot you out to deliver his lies, the masses will believe you, and no one will be prepared for what's coming except for me and the people on this list.
I expect him back early this evening.<eos> So you were with Darius<eos> Tanz at a ball in<eos> Washington, D.C.?<eos> More of a reception.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't blowing you off, I swear.<eos> No, but he had offered you a job, and you said, "No."<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, because I have unfinished business here.<eos> Anyway, what's going on with you? Tell me about you.
Not only fresh water but provisions.<eos> We don't have much food.<eos> What will they think?<eos> The people there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> They call them Mussulman.<eos> And they worship a god named Allah.<eos> Margrethe.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.
So you feel sorry for yourself?<eos> Poor little Sigurd.<eos> You're wrong, Ivar.<eos> I don't feel sorry for myself.<eos> Yeah. Right. No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.<eos> Then what kind of a son are you?<eos> What does it matter what your mother did to you?
What do you think it means?<eos> You tell me.<eos> All right, I will, Mommy's boy.<eos> Mommy's little favorite!<eos> Are you just really sad she can't breastfeed you anymore, is that it?<eos> Whoever would have thought that you two were brothers?<eos> To what do we owe the honor of your visit?<eos> I wanted to see my family.<eos> I also wanted to warn you.<eos> You mean, Ecbert sent you.
You have new responsibilities now.<eos> No.<eos> We are coming with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, we are a family now.<eos> Whatever happens, we must be together.<eos> But the girl still isn't eating properly.<eos> She doesn't seem settled or happy.<eos> It is you that is not happy, Floki.<eos> Something happened to you in Algeciras and you have not been the same.

My horn is empty.<eos> Mine too!<eos> Egil...<eos> You have seen all you needed to?<eos> Enough to know they are not as safe and secure as they think they are.<eos> Go and make your plans.<eos> We wait to hear of your success,<eos> Earl Egil.<eos> You should have killed Ellisif when you had the chance.<eos> She dishonored you.
You're not behaving like a King anymore.<eos> People are already talking about it.<eos> You're distracted, you're withdrawn.<eos> You seem unsure, and hesitant, when once you were firm, you were strong.<eos> Oh, I am filled with doubts.<eos> And I've begun to believe that being firm and strong was the illusion and that I am unsure now because it is the most honest way to be.<eos> Not in the face of a great heathen army that are come to destroy us.<eos> That is why I have placed you in command of our armies.<eos> I trust you completely.<eos> It's why I always used you.
You are crazy.<eos> You have the mind of a child!<eos> And all you do is play music, Sigurd!<eos> I'm just as much a son of Ragnar as you are.<eos> I'm not so sure. As far as I remember, Ragnar didn't play the oud.<eos> And he certainly didn't offer his arse to other men!<eos> You make me laugh. Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!
And he certainly didn't offer his arse to other men!<eos> You make me laugh. Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!<eos> What's the matter, Ivar?<eos> You can't take it?<eos> Ivar, do not listen to him.<eos> No, I guess it must be hard for you now that your mommy's dead.<eos> Knowing she's the only one who ever really loved you.
Was it you?<eos> Was what me?<eos> How did you do it?<eos> Did you slip poison into her wine?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My wife!<eos> She has been poisoned and I think I know who did it!<eos> Do not be ridiculous!<eos> You yourself said you would declare war on her!<eos> I may dislike her clothes, I may mock her, I may hate her for stealing you from me and in the dark of night, I have wished her dead, but I wouldn't go so far as to make her dead.
It would have been good propaganda, wouldn't it;<eos> had I died?<eos> Your brother sacrifices himself, for you.<eos> Please, try to be reasonable.<eos> What would you have written on my tombstone?<eos> "He gave his ass for France?"<eos> Brother, please!<eos> If you had died tonight, I would have lost my closest friend.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> Because, after all we've been through, after all the hurt I've caused you, you love me as I love you.
That was the third base the Titans have destroyed.<eos> My plan is nine centuries in the making.<eos> In every age, there are always those who oppose me.<eos> But as you can see, I am always victorious.<eos> Is that the reporter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.<eos> His heresy does not compare to the Titan's threat.<eos> We barely escaped them.<eos> But you did, because he warned you.
I have often wondered why?<eos> Why me?<eos> But now I know.<eos> It was meant to bring me to this age this place, this moment where technology can at last be made to serve my greatness.<eos> Proceed.<eos> You've done well.<eos> Advance the preparations, Mayhem.<eos> The time has come for us to move from immortality to glory.<eos> Your service has come to an end.<eos> Bless you, my son.
Don't be.<eos> I don't need your pity.<eos> It can be a bond, you know?<eos> - Everyone on the team's had it rough. - Yeah.<eos> I can tell Princess Sparkle Thong knows all about eating from a dumpster.<eos> Kori is a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister.<eos> - Jaime has a family that loves him.<eos> - And, because of the bug odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.<eos> I think pain is what makes a hero.<eos> It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.
Yeah, we're good.<eos> He's lying to you.<eos> About everything.<eos> He had you pegged from the start.<eos> That's how he does it.<eos> Mixing truth with lies.<eos> You're so freaking annoying.<eos> You don't know anything about him.<eos> He saved me.<eos> Let me guess, he kept you isolated.

What have you done to Robin?<eos> I beat the crap out of him for being mouthy.<eos> Come on, you've all had the urge.<eos> Once I get out, I'm gonna break you into little bits.<eos> It's good to have goals, ese.<eos> Me, I'm having waffles after you're dead.<eos> By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?<eos> I think you've met.<eos> Hey, team, how's things?<eos> Terra, what did he do to you?
- Yeah.<eos> - What did I do?<eos> - You threatened Señora Mendoza.<eos> That's what.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> He really is that stupid.<eos> Ricardo's mother.<eos> I'm there to support my homie, bro.<eos> Why would I threaten his mom?<eos> I don't know... to make sure your homie doesn't rat you out? What about her?
Oh, we're good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Close to 30 million cows were slaughtered in 2016 alone.<eos> This is pork.<eos> Anyway, the ME's report says Lily's lungs were filled with river water, making the COD drowning.<eos> External bruising?<eos> - She had Klonopin in her blood. - How much?<eos> Enough to stop her from changing her mind.<eos> It was a suicide, Peter.<eos> The duct tape didn't look suspicious to you?
Shit!<eos> - Dennis.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Fuck, Oscar.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> - I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - I talked to my brother-in-law.<eos> I told you he knows the inspector you got coming into the wine store.
You can't get any.<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> People are stealing cars from the police lot?<eos> Audacious, I'll tell you that.<eos> The security didn't get a good look at the guy.<eos> Just saw a person with a baseball cap and a hoodie over it.<eos> Cameras didn't catch anything, either.<eos> Now this is a hooptie.<eos> Perfect for RJ, but one thing this job teaches you is that you can't judge a book by its cover.
Now, tell me everything.<eos> You two made a mistake.<eos> Dino's clean.<eos> Turn over another stone.<eos> This is why I love you.<eos> I mean, how do you get that big old heart into that tiny little perfect body?<eos> He's innocent.<eos> Why? Because he says he is?<eos> It's a pretty good reason.<eos> Listen, Trish. I'm sorry we didn't tell you he was a suspect; I honestly forgot.
What were you watching?<eos> A Lakers' game.<eos> They were off.<eos> I meant to say the Clippers.<eos> Who were they playing?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> What were you doing after the game?<eos> We went to sleep.<eos> All right, listen, Jerry.<eos> If your brother actually cared about you, he wouldn't put you in this position.
- How serious is it?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Probably just the flu.<eos> - The flu?<eos> - It will pass.<eos> Is there no remedy?<eos> Antibiotics?<eos> It's a virus. Antibiotics won't help.<eos> Take it like a man, Carl.<eos> The best advice I can give you is to stay in bed and stay hydrated.
Not many people deserve eternal life.<eos> There.<eos> Now all we can do is wait.<eos> Hi, there you are.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> What did you want to see me about?<eos> I know you're hiding Teodor Naustvik.<eos> I know.<eos> We can work this out together. As friends.<eos> I'll keep you and your stuff out of it.
Oprah dreamed of hiding presents under chairs.<eos> And I dreamed of building something magnificent.<eos> Well, recently, Jay and I bought a vacant lot on which we are building Dunphy Tower.<eos> What I wouldn't give to reach back in time to tell the 15-year-old dreamer who drew this,<eos> "We did it, kid."<eos> - Claire, you look terrible.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> No. I mean, you're all locked up.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I guess the spa day that I booked for you tomorrow came at the perfect time.
Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.<eos> But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.<eos> I have gotten much better at that.<eos> Have you?<eos> How am I feeling right now?<eos> What the...<eos> Excited? Itchy?<eos> Give me the first letter.<eos> You and I are in a relationship.<eos> I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
Ignore him.<eos> How did you get the baby to stop crying?<eos> Oh, I just talked to her.<eos> I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.<eos> You poor things, you must be exhausted.<eos> It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.<eos> How can she hate me?<eos> I make her food in my chest!<eos> It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.<eos> She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.
I didn't buy it.<eos> It was in the apartment when I moved in.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to just move in with me?<eos> We already shook on it. The bet stands.<eos> Prepare to die, and by "die," I mean move in with me.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I get that the streets are empty, but slow down, man.<eos> Terry forgot his Dramamine.<eos> Stakes are high, Sarge.<eos> I know it doesn't matter to you, but I really want to beat Amy.
And then by the time that bottle's finished, you've come to your senses and apologized.<eos> Maybe I don't want to win this bet.<eos> Okay, we need to figure out whether this crash was an accident or part of a deliberate escape plan.<eos> Gina, I need you manning the tip line.<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> Good luck talking to the crazies.<eos> Crazies?<eos> Oh, Rosa. Sad Rosa.<eos> Have some respect for your fellow human beings.<eos> What has gotten into you?
Oh, my God, what a beautiful moment.<eos> And, you guys, Amy's ovulating as we speak!<eos> - What?<eos> - Charles!<eos> All right, head to the back.<eos> You're going to jail.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't get it. Why did you decide to let me win?<eos> I don't know.<eos> When we were back there racing through the Miranda Rights, I just looked over at you and thought,
The Kraken destroyed our starboard propeller.<eos> Liam, take Martin and Harris and get on repairs. Let's go.<eos> You heard the captain. Come on!<eos> Wonderful.<eos> You both have made a bloody mess of this.<eos> Have you got any idea how rare a Kraken is?<eos> I need its blood to get back to Emma.<eos> She's in danger. And now... now I've got no way of getting back home!<eos> Unless, of course... Unless you lend me one of your wishes.<eos> A wish won't get you back to Emma.
Not while I hold onto the tears of the Savior.<eos> This is some powerful stuff.<eos> You should be more careful where you leave it.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You're not Aesop, are you?<eos> You're not even a bartender.<eos> No.<eos> What now, Gideon?<eos> You try to kill me again?<eos> It didn't turn out very well for you last time.
You just had an ice cream cone!<eos> - Are you going to have room? - My mom says I'm a growing girl.<eos> You're going to be doing an awful lot of growing today.<eos> Opal, why don't you go inside the cafe and I will meet you there?<eos> Okay.<eos> Someone doesn't look very happy.<eos> My dad was supposed to take me for a walk, but he's busy.<eos> He's just talking to Nurse Carter.<eos> I think he likes her.<eos> Philip, just because your father likes someone doesn't mean he likes you any less.
So you're still here.<eos> I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see you here.<eos> I wanted to see your face... now that everyone knows what you did.<eos> Everyone?<eos> Who have you been talking to?<eos> Mayor Stanton.<eos> The Sheriff.<eos> Anyone who would listen.<eos> I lost my wife, Marlise.<eos> Isn't that enough for you?
She can't defend herself.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> I know you're still angry with your dad for sending you here.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> This is your last warning, Cadet.<eos> Expel me.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> No... you don't get off that easy.<eos> You need this school more than you know.<eos> Now go outside... and wait for security to escort you back to the dorms.
Doubt you could do much for your sister if you can't even take care of yourself.<eos> To really protect people... you need power.<eos> This place is the first step in getting it.<eos> It's not too late to do the right thing.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Colonel Nix is ready for you.<eos> Good luck, Cadet Weller.<eos> It couldn't have been the only time that I met Shepherd.<eos> Maybe being back here on campus will help you remember.<eos> Even if you only met her that one time, you know that she was watching you here.
The attacks, the bodies Shepherd has dropped over the years, all of my crimes, what's it all for?<eos> I want to understand why I'd follow someone like her.<eos> She believes the system only serves those in power instead of the people it's supposed to.<eos> Is she wrong?<eos> Seems like the government controls everything.<eos> Look at us, I'm...<eos> I'm stuck in this box, and you're forced to work for them.<eos> How do you know you're not brainwashed now?<eos> We're on the right side of this.<eos> Look, Shepherd's beliefs may seem noble, but she doesn't care who she hurts, and whatever feelings that you're having for her, that's what she used to control you.
Thank you.<eos> I still can't believe you have never played. Skee-ball before, how is that even possible?<eos> I know we said the past is just the past, but this is much more mysterious than your tattoos.<eos> Well, let's just say I had a very unusual childhood.<eos> So, what will this get us?<eos> How does a brand-new - pencil eraser sound?<eos> - Kinda boring.<eos> What about a plastic set of vampire fangs?<eos> Better.<eos> You know, I thought I was never gonna hear from you again.
Make sure he didn't say too much.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> I've got to say, it's nice... to be in the same room as you again.<eos> You know, that day we met at the academy, you had so much anger inside of you but so much potential to fight for what's right.<eos> I saw a lot of myself in you.<eos> Is that why you've been manipulating my life?<eos> The scholarship, the job transfer, sending Jane to me with all the tattoos.<eos> What's it all for?<eos> Kurt, you and I, we're... we're saving this country.<eos> I didn't know when I first met you that day how important you would be to all of this.
I haven't been alone at night for so long.<eos> Will you lock me in and protect me?<eos> What's he doing back?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I got run off the road.<eos> - Where's Anderson?<eos> - I lost him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You need to get that looked at.<eos> - Who ran you off the road?
- Where's Anderson?<eos> - I lost him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You need to get that looked at.<eos> - Who ran you off the road?<eos> - I didn't see.<eos> Get hold of Dumas Fils and see where Anderson is and get every highway unit looking out for his car.<eos> - Can I help?<eos> - We'll clean him up.<eos> So you didn't see who ran you off the road?
What happened to you?<eos> He... tried to kill me.<eos> Who did?<eos> Bertinet. That policeman.<eos> I've come to protect you.<eos> Where... Where were you going?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Were you leaving because I wasn't coming back?<eos> I love you.<eos> Sssh. And... And God loves you.
He... tried to kill me.<eos> Who did?<eos> Bertinet. That policeman.<eos> I've come to protect you.<eos> Where... Where were you going?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Were you leaving because I wasn't coming back?<eos> I love you.<eos> Sssh. And... And God loves you.<eos> He will always be watching over you.
- Bite me.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Okay, here's the thing.<eos> I am so happy you found love, and I'm glad Adam feels comfortable enough to spend the night here.<eos> But you got to know, I can hear every thing you do all freakin' night long.<eos> Everything?<eos> Yes, you ass-slapping fool, everything.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Just keep in mind that our apartment has thin walls and your daughter's insurance doesn't cover therapy.<eos> Did you try the noise-canceling headphones I got you?
I had a boyfriend introduce me to his best friend, then he married him.<eos> Do you need a bread maker? I've got three.<eos> I wasn't gonna make bread.<eos> Do they expect me to make bread?<eos> What are you gonna dip in the fondue?<eos> I was just gonna buy bread.<eos> Bonnie, these are Hollywood people. They are not gonna eat bread out of a bag.<eos> You know what, this is too much pressure.<eos> I'm just gonna break up with Adam.<eos> Relax, I'm sure you can pretend to be a good person long enough for them to like you.
_<eos> I know you all have busy lives, what with college, and having a family, and your "art"<eos> But I'm glad you're all here for your last New Year's Eve.<eos> "Last"?<eos> What, are you going to murder us all?<eos> No. He thinks the world is going to end.<eos> It is!<eos> In three hours, the Y2K bug is going to bite, and it's going to hurt like when a wasp gets you in the penis.
Maybe later.<eos> I remember when I was that young.<eos> Yeah, they're green, but I'll whip 'em into shape.<eos> Remember, I learned from the best.<eos> And you've turned into a fine leader.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got to admit, I was surprised to hear you turned down Collins' offer.<eos> Well, I had my reasons.<eos> She's a very pretty one.<eos> You got a girl waiting for you back home?
It's not like we can arrest him.<eos> We could freeze him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> We're not freezing the mayor.<eos> Conspiracy theory brain must be wearing off.<eos> You're being very reasonable.<eos> I'm more concerned with the fact that I'm currently on the cover of Seattle's alt weekly with red eyes and rage veins bulging out of my face.<eos> I'm Seattle's only identifiable zombie.<eos> No, you're not identifiable.<eos> People look at you and all they see is gorgeous.
Fine.<eos> If you do find those missing videos of that dominatrix's sessions, don't be surprised if you see me on them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, take a couple of days, think it over.<eos> Chief of staff to the mayor of a major American city before you're 30.<eos> That beats assistant district attorney, doesn't it?<eos> No way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Like I'd be seen at the Space Needle with Chaos Killer.<eos> So, some famehungry floozy reminds all of Seattle why they hate you, and then this zombie army outfit that's like your only family, throws you out because this floozy outed you as a human?
I think so.<eos> Unless you don't think so.<eos> An exclusive couple?<eos> Are you technically a couple if you're not exclusive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think couple equals exclusive.<eos> I can't believe you were doubting this.<eos> I've just been feeling a little uncertain lately.<eos> I haven't had the best luck with boyfriends.<eos> And I think I may have been keeping you at arm's length because of that.
Wow.<eos> I definitely didn't fake that one.<eos> That's the first time in years.<eos> I'm glad I could be a part of it.<eos> Why don't you come with me?<eos> Come away to Positano.<eos> Right.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're just telling me about your life here, how people treat you.<eos> What's keeping you here?
To Major!<eos> Hey, hey, there's a beverage here.<eos> All right. I'll miss you guys, too.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'm gonna miss you guys.<eos> Back at you, man.<eos> Listen, can we talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> I hate to pull you out of there.
Not fair!<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Special delivery.<eos> Hey!<eos> Is this a game for you?<eos> No game, just outsmarting my opponent.<eos> Care to take a shot?<eos> History lesson.<eos> The Jedi won the war with Mandalore.<eos> These tricks will amount to something, maybe save you from time to time, but they won't keep you alive in the long run.
Miss Thatcher.<eos> My brother's barely in town for an hour, and you're already complaining.<eos> Miss Thatcher sent me a telegram.<eos> She did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She said she's having trouble with my boys.<eos> You don't have to listen to her.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> But if there's a problem...<eos> The problem is, you're standing here talking instead of doing your work, so get to your desk and do what I pay you to do.
Hey, you wanna stay for dinner?<eos> We're having spaghetti.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm supposed to go to the pond with my brother.<eos> Well, I'm sure Miss Abigail won't mind if Earl joins you, too.<eos> I hate spaghetti.<eos> Come on.<eos> Chad?<eos> You don't have to do everything your brother tells you to do.
Oh, and he is not going to be one bit pleased when he finds out I almost hit the mercantile.<eos> And a wagon.<eos> And Katie Brayman's chickens.<eos> The town council really needs to think about making the streets wider.<eos> Ahem. Sweetheart.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> - I'll go get the tea. - I'll help!<eos> Before you say anything... I want you to know it wasn't my fault.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So the car forced you to get behind the wheel?
We're family.<eos> Henry?<eos> Bill.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> I only drink with friends.<eos> Well, then you must be pretty thirsty.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want a truce, for the sake of the town.<eos> The railroad's here now and we need to work together.<eos> Never figured you for bending the knee for anyone.
I'll be fine.<eos> I'll be here when you get back.<eos> That's what makes it easier.<eos> Bye.<eos> We'll need a full re-allocation of men to the Northern positions.<eos> Five divisions at least to bring them up to Fort Winston if you have to.<eos> Gordon Harvey.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You too.<eos> What brings you out our way?
Good to see you.<eos> You too.<eos> What brings you out our way?<eos> Prisoner transfer.<eos> Tell me...<eos> What do you hear from the Northern Territories?<eos> Nothing good.<eos> Our boys really got a fight on their hands.<eos> Guess I'll be seeing it first-hand soon enough.<eos> Collins transferred you up there?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lesson to prepare.<eos> That is the last one.<eos> I've written to every woman I know who was offered a teaching position by Higgins.<eos> Someone's going to step up.<eos> Someone has to.<eos> What if no one does?<eos> Then you'll write more letters.<eos> As many as it takes.<eos> I just hope I can afford the postage.<eos> Something's bothering you. I can tell.
You're right.<eos> I'm translating boring conversations.<eos> My supervisor asked if there could be a double meaning from an Afghan point of view.<eos> But I can't think of any.<eos> Actually, I can't think at all.<eos> Is this about your office again?<eos> It doesn't promote quality thought.<eos> A good thinking spot is key.<eos> I like the library.<eos> How can your mind breathe with all those musty books suffocating you? Ah.
It doesn't promote quality thought.<eos> A good thinking spot is key.<eos> I like the library.<eos> How can your mind breathe with all those musty books suffocating you? Ah.<eos> Well, what would you suggest?<eos> A place with much oxygen.<eos> - The forest.<eos> - Qasim.<eos> Hey, nice to see you, man.<eos> Oh, they let you out of the annex building?
This was all him.<eos> What?<eos> Sources are now confirming that the two men injured in this morning's plane explosion, are, in fact, alive although one of them remains in critical condition.<eos> You kidding me?<eos> They ran the story anyway.<eos> Chen knows that you're alive and you could be a target, Reeves.<eos> You need to lay low.<eos> Yeah, I'd rather not.<eos> If you've got a shirt I could borrow, that'd be lovely.<eos> The doc released you?
The pilot, Miller-- he followed me.<eos> You need to lay low.<eos> Gibbs.<eos> Before he left, I heard Jintao on the phone.<eos> He was speaking Chinese.<eos> He said Chen's planning another attack.<eos> We need to get this guy before he does more damage.<eos> Put me back in.<eos> Come on, all I need is a shirt.<eos> You're here until the doctor releases you.
Pilot tipped him off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But how did the pilot know that Willoughby was a setup?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you got it, boss.<eos> I've officially been released, all right?<eos> Go ahead, call him back and tell him.<eos> What?<eos> Gibbs.<eos> He sent you here to check on me, yeah?
Took his own life to protect them.<eos> McGee, if Chen was able to scare Miller that much, what did he know?<eos> Well, he's been with the organization for five years, traveling with Chen.<eos> Got paid a ton of money to be on call, like all of Chen's pilots.<eos> What about Reeves?<eos> Well, I still have more on Miller...<eos> No, but did you know that Reeves spent months getting his pilot license, and then gaining Miller's trust to become his go-to backup?<eos> I mean, that's like, a huge commitment for him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bishop, I read you in on this, remember?
What?<eos> Six, nine, seven, nine, three.<eos> They're talking about unlucky numbers.<eos> "69793 is not to be trusted."<eos> Gibbs... that's the end of the number of my pilot certificate.<eos> They're talking about me.<eos> When was that call made?<eos> Weeks ago.<eos> If they knew they couldn't trust me back then... how long has Chen known about Willoughby?<eos> Geez, what'd that bubble wrap ever do to you?
The wound is no longer visible.<eos> "No longer visible", what does that mean?<eos> Frankly, I'm not sure.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> So, Charlotte told me that you met Mr Westmorland?<eos> He came and looked at me.<eos> When was that?<eos> After the French doctor.<eos> She says Delphine was very nice.<eos> Did... Did he tell you what kind of cancer you have?
Okay, before your CAT scan, are you familiar with an amniocentesis?<eos> Needle.<eos> Is that medically necessary?<eos> I'll explain everything to your wife, Mr Hendrix.<eos> Our staff would like to talk to you about her accident.<eos> Standard stuff, just a few questions.<eos> Sir, this way, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll be all right? Alison?<eos> Felix, make sure they get a good look at you.
"Today?" "Yes, today."<eos> And I resigned.<eos> And... they lost director.<eos> I have a lot of calls, but I'm just changing my telephones.<eos> People are looking for their job, but laboratory is almost empty.<eos> Empty.<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> I just know what I'm reading in the newspaper and in the press and... You know.<eos> Oh, really? Really?<eos> I mean, will they come after you?
Not that new.<eos> I have some sad news to tell you.<eos> Yes?<eos> I am going into the witness protection program.<eos> - You are? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the current situation is unclear.<eos> - So, this is serious? - Yes.<eos> For a while?<eos> I was thinking of you yesterday.
They're hijacking her memories.<eos> Infecting them like a virus.<eos> She's just reinforcing their lies.<eos> She's dying for nothing!<eos> There must be a way to shut this thing down!<eos> Hello, Mum.<eos> Doctor, look!<eos> You clever, brilliant, ridiculous girl!<eos> Look at that!<eos> All the pictures I gave you!
This is between you and Reagan.<eos> Jess, you've got to talk to her.<eos> You've got to deal with this.<eos> She trusts you.<eos> Please, you've got to help.<eos> Hey... Ray Ray.<eos> - Boo Boo?<eos> - Is this about the apartment?<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.
- Thanks, man.<eos> See myself out.<eos> I got to say, a lot of international people living here, it's... there's good and bad in that, huh?<eos> I feel like we should probably... revisit that.<eos> What about your thing, Reagan?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Well, my company rents apartments for all of their transplants.<eos> And I guess I didn't tell you about it because... I'm scared, and I wanted a backup plan.<eos> It checks out.<eos> I just felt like if I came on too strong, It-it would scare you away.
You just let her die?<eos> I'm sorry, Kelly.<eos> Can I get another pour?<eos> Got a young girl, nonresponsive.<eos> That's Severide's car.<eos> - This is bad.<eos> - Yeah, I know. - What's wrong?<eos> - You got to come with us.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You can either come with us now or wait for some uniforms to come down here and put you in cuffs.
Well, that's his problem.<eos> No, actually... actually it is your problem.<eos> See, there's a thing called reasonable suspicion.<eos> If he's filling your shopping list, then you can be held responsible for whatever Ryan did on the street.<eos> - So, you ain't going anywhere until we get Ryan.<eos> You understand?<eos> Ryan Novak. He's the guy Zadra was getting cars from.<eos> Did three years in Menard for GTA and aggravated carjacking.<eos> Paroled a year ago.<eos> And if it's dark and this guy speeds by you in a car at night, you could easily mistake him for Severide.
Start running those ID, I bet we come up with a few felonies.<eos> Or we can charge her with vehicular homicide.<eos> Got plenty to go on.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Call your son.<eos> Tell him turn himself in. We'll let you go. No charges.<eos> I wouldn't waste my time.<eos> Ryan will never give himself up to the cops.<eos> There's always Plan B.<eos> All right, you said Novak ripped you off for three cars, right?
You've just been working so hard.<eos> I've been killing myself trying to impress Kim.<eos> Call the tween footwear people.<eos> Here's their number.<eos> Don't trouble yourself.<eos> I've got it memorized.<eos> You just dialed 17 numbers.<eos> - Loretta, I need you!<eos> - Freakin' Loretta!<eos> Kim will take you seriously when she sees you in that fine-ass suit.
I'm a window washer, and I finally got to the top floor.<eos> You don't like that one?<eos> How about this one? I'm a traffic guy, and I fell out of the news chopper.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - All these work perfectly.<eos> I'll just pick my favorite on the way over.<eos> Sit down, you nincompoop.<eos> This is completely my fault.<eos> I just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.<eos> And I just wanted to find some way to show you... how much I love you.
- Winston wanted a kids choir, but this is all we could get on such short notice.<eos> They're called Protect and Swerve.<eos> ♪ Oh, Alison ♪<eos> ♪ My aim is true... ♪<eos> "Aly, I'm in love with you.<eos> "I love your face, your mind... and your butt."<eos> Good opening, good opening.<eos> "As a young black man,<eos> "I never thought I'd feel safe "with a police officer.<eos> "When I met you, I threw away all my shoes, 'cause they made me feel like I was walking on air."
Six days, patrón.<eos> You know, we didn't always use the collar.<eos> But the dogs would tear open the carotid artery.<eos> Next thing you know, it would be over too quickly, huh?<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> You're doing all this for your brother's honor, when the truth is he had none.<eos> You didn't know my brother.<eos> I know he tried to sell you out.<eos> He was gonna give up Frontera, knowing that the DEA was gonna use him to bring down your entire organization.<eos> He betrayed you, Carlos.
What happened to 2008?<eos> L-Look, I-I wish we could keep talking here, but I-I really... I need to get back to these lease agreements.<eos> Oh. My bad.<eos> Yeah, of course. Yeah.<eos> Hey. Always be closing, right?<eos> I almost tripped over this thing.<eos> Oh, that's kind of a weird placement for a plant, Bob, don't you think?<eos> Hey, brother, if you're trying to get your luck to change, you better get some feng shui going on up in here;<eos> I'm not feeling it right now.<eos> Tell you what, let me help you out.
I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> So, you just bashed Mitch's head in about five, six times with one of these trophies by accident?<eos> I had a buyer who was ready to sign on a car.<eos> But he was very particular.<eos> He would only take silver with certain options.<eos> And it just so happens that that exact same model came in in inventory.<eos> Except, Mitch already had a deposit on it.<eos> But I know you, Bob.<eos> Always be closing.<eos> You didn't let that stop you, did you?
Come on.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Hold on, Bob.<eos> You still think I'm a car salesman?<eos> Bob.<eos> Time to pack it up there, Roy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Chin, something about this doesn't add up.<eos> Doesn't it seem odd to you that Mitch would be this desperate to get one car back?
I found a great listing.<eos> It's clean, roomy, close to work.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Oh, Commander, what a pleasant surprise.<eos> Hey.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Hey, thank you.<eos> Thanks, Max.<eos> What brings you around in the neighborhood?
Thanks, Max.<eos> What brings you around in the neighborhood?<eos> Oh, I'm, uh here about the rental.<eos> Yes, uh... well, I was just gauging the temperature of the local leasing market.<eos> Sabrina and I are thinking about upgrading to a bigger space.<eos> You know, Max, I hear your dollar goes a long way in Africa.<eos> Come on, Max, I mean, it wasn't-wasn't too hard to piece together.<eos> And it wasn't just you hiring a new M.E. or-or listing your apartment;<eos> the minute you got back, I had a feeling we'd be having this conversation, because you changed when you went away, Max.<eos> It was clear that that experience really affected you.
Sam, look, you got some stuff to figure out, but you will.<eos> You're a good guy.<eos> You're sensitive, and you're funny, and the woman who ends up with you will be lucky.<eos> You want to marry your best friend.<eos> Edison?<eos> Not your turtle, Sam.<eos> You said my best friend. He's my best friend.<eos> I just...<eos> I meant you want to be with someone who appreciates you for what you are.<eos> You know, who loves all the little odd things about you... who gets you.
Dammit!<eos> ..it has already begun.<eos> You talking to yourself in there?<eos> I'm meditating.<eos> You've been in there for hours.<eos> I've been trying to talk to you.<eos> Have you double-locked this thing?<eos> I'm busy thinking.<eos> Excellent - who needs eyesight?<eos> Those Monk creatures I told you about - if they've modelled every event in human history, if they've simulated entire events streamed from day one till now, think what they'd know.
There's no look on my face.<eos> They did not come here in peace, we have to do what we can.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> It's two minutes to now.<eos> The Doomsday Clock is moving.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Co-ordinate your attacks.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> What's wrong with the Doctor?<eos> Did Nardole send you to speak to me?
The Doomsday Clock is moving.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Co-ordinate your attacks.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> What's wrong with the Doctor?<eos> Did Nardole send you to speak to me?<eos> Might have done.<eos> Might have said there was something you ought to tell me.<eos> Funny thing, fear, isn't it?<eos> Once it rules you, you're even afraid to admit what's scaring you.
Please, don't even consider this!<eos> What I saw was real.<eos> I felt it!<eos> If you can help us, I consent.<eos> Please, listen to me!<eos> Do you have power?<eos> I have power.<eos> Does power consent?<eos> Please, stop - just stop this!<eos> If your consent is impure, it will kill you.
Would you make the deal?<eos> No, not if I had a choice.<eos> But we don't, do we?<eos> It's your world.<eos> Not any more.<eos> OK, back to the pyramid and negotiate our surrender.<eos> Doctor?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Well for a start, I'm going to tell you the truth.<eos> I've been keeping a secret from you.
Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.<eos> It's okay, Howie never has on pants.<eos> The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now.<eos> Well, Sheldon always has his pants on.<eos> I don't think I could pick his knees out of a lineup.<eos> Well, it's not just the pants. Just, it's like since we got married, he doesn't really try anymore.<eos> Uh, Penny?<eos> I don't know how to say this, but this is my first girls' night and you're kind of bumming everybody out.<eos> All right, got Halley to sleep.<eos> Yeah, I heard you on the baby monitor.
Did you have anything to eat?<eos> Uh, chips.<eos> Anything to drink?<eos> Some wine.<eos> Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.<eos> Just ignore him.<eos> At least he took an interest.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, what's going on with you?
Stay out of my business, and get back to work.<eos> Carlotta.<eos> Star?<eos> - Star, I...<eos> - What's up?<eos> I've been thinking about this contest and... you don't think people will see us?<eos> That's the point, Simone.<eos> Okay, you really don't think that nobody's coming looking for us?<eos> Excuse me, I'll rinse it in a second.<eos> I told you to stop talking like this.
You got to be honest.<eos> You need to tell them about Jahil, what he did to y'all, whyou don't like him.<eos> Ain't about Star.<eos> It's about you being honest with yourself.<eos> That's the only way you gonna get through all this.<eos> And I know them girls, they're gonna be a handful.<eos> I don't like none of them.<eos> Real talk.<eos> I'm gonna get you a zanny bar.<eos> Calm you all the way down.
Get out the tub, you slut.<eos> Maggie.<eos> How are you, love?<eos> Wipe the seat.<eos> You look so beautiful, hmm?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You have what you want.<eos> Look at you.<eos> - You stayed away a long, long time.<eos> - I know, sweetheart, and I'm sorry about that, but you know I love you, right?
You said you can sing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, sing.<eos> If you let the Lord use you, he'll bless you every time.<eos> You know what?<eos> Help her out.<eos> Y'all gonna pull it together.<eos> Thou shall not judge.<eos> We ain't judging.<eos> He bye, bye, bye see you.
I didn't try to kill myself.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You know that white light thing?<eos> I think I believe it, 'cause... 'cause when I, I went to the other side,<eos> I think I saw my mom.<eos> I...<eos> I believe in angels, but I don't know if I believe in God.<eos> God saved my life just the way He saved yours.<eos> When you hit rock bottom, that's when God shows up the most.<eos> He showed up for you and kept you alive.
They have to want it.<eos> And even if they do, sometimes it just doesn't work.<eos> Maybe you should move back to New York.<eos> Finish Julliard.<eos> Go on a big world tour, meet all these new people.<eos> I thought you wanted me to stay.<eos> Then it's Julliard.<eos> No, I do.<eos> But them girls.<eos> They gonna mess you up and turn you out.
Mama, Arnold is dead.<eos> And I'm not talking about Granddaddy.<eos> I'm talking about this Arnold.<eos> This Arnold is dead.<eos> Gone.<eos> I'm getting bottom surgery.<eos> It ain't enough with the boobs and the hair and the makeup?<eos> No, Mama.<eos> I need my outsides to match my insides.<eos> Well, why would you pay somebody to mutilate what God gave you?
Next thing you know, they're both calling here booking appointments.<eos> Get up, he's here.<eos> Get up, he's here.<eos> - No. Who?<eos> - Otis.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, it's too... It's... Mm-mm.<eos> - It's too early for this. - No, I heard him talking to Miss Carlotta.<eos> What if he's telling her that you tried to kill him?<eos> Okay. What you heard is that medication - they got you on.
_<eos> It's because I let you girls go.<eos> All right, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna get out of here.<eos> We're open seven days a week, so just call and make an appointment anytime.<eos> We'll be more than happy to take you, okay?<eos> Your hair is beautiful, by the way.<eos> That's right, baby, we got wigs, closures,<eos> - weaves, anything you need, baby.<eos> - And I want to give you one of these because I think this would be a great texture for you. Mm, mm, mm.
And I want to just say it's an honor for me to be able to bring her up onstage.<eos> She's a living legend, an icon, Ms. Gladys Knight.<eos> I am so proud to introduce, and I'm honored that they're performing for you tonight one of my favorite songs.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> God's Blessings Beauty Salon.<eos> ♪ Ooh, I love you so ♪<eos> ♪ But why I love you, I'll never know ♪<eos> ♪ You found a reason... ♪ That's my auntie.<eos> - Yeah. - You know?<eos> ♪ Soon as I gave my love to you ♪

You know what?<eos> It's all good.<eos> We got what we needed.<eos> - What is your problem?<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> You don't see this?<eos> This hack that calls himself a photographer is trying to lighten me up to blend with you two.<eos> Oh my God, dude, you're being sensitive.<eos> I'm being sensitive.<eos> He was practically salivating taking photos of you.
Girl, that's what they say.<eos> Pastor here.<eos> I'm gonna send him right to Regina's.<eos> Cotton, why don't you run up to my bedroom and get that old curling iron?<eos> Really?<eos> Say it.<eos> Just say it.<eos> You don't want me here when your holy crush walks in.<eos> Just get the damn iron.<eos> I think it'd be good for you.
Is that what you're wearing?<eos> I'm going to Derek's uncle's barbecue first.<eos> How come I'm not invited?<eos> Like you'd want to go.<eos> Hunter said he wanted me to be his "street bitch."<eos> Wow, he's a kinky one, isn't he?<eos> And Star isn't?<eos> I don't know, you guys.<eos> You think his family will respond to me?<eos> Respond to you?

It's tragic.<eos> Yeah, you should do something to animarla.<eos> Ani what?<eos> Uh, give to her happiness.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> You got any ideas?<eos> Take her away a few days.<eos> Like a romantic getaway?<eos> ¿Porque no?<eos> Ed... how they treating you in here, bro?
Yeah, she is.<eos> She's showing her ass 'cause I'm in here.<eos> And you felt sorry for her when I used to knock her upside the head.<eos> She still come visit you?<eos> Yeah, every Saturday, like clockwork.<eos> And she still don't know?<eos> You think I'm gonna tell that bitch that she's the reason I'm here?<eos> That she's the one that put me behind bars?<eos> I tell her I love her, I miss her, I need her, and I can't wait to hug her again.<eos> Listen, man, I don't come visit you 'cause
Something will come up,<eos> - a video or something.<eos> - Alex, stop it... it's me up against a bunch of pissed off cops.<eos> I won't have a fair trial.<eos> They've been after me for months.<eos> Derek, look at all you've fought for.<eos> You'd give that up now?<eos> It's already been decided, baby girl.<eos> It's how the system works.<eos> When I met you... you said that you were gonna save the world.
- Where are you going?<eos> - For a walk.<eos> Alone.<eos> Cotton, 20 years ago,<eos> I broke off my relationship with God.<eos> I was in this exact place.<eos> The church was no place for a sinner like me.<eos> I asked for God to put forgiveness in my heart, and only through prayer, I was led back to God.<eos> I'm doing this for my mother.<eos> And she appreciates you for it.
- Mom.<eos> Mom, relax.<eos> - Star isn't going anywhere.<eos> - Shut up. You will not do what your father did to me. Am I clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That you're willing to take all of this says a lot about who you are.<eos> I don't know who's worse between you and your mother.<eos> But you sure are a weird-ass little couple.<eos> Why didn't you call me? I was home.<eos> I would've let you in.
And I've been good to you? You have.<eos> You'll let me make it up to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just let her stay for like a second.<eos> I'm gonna make it up to you, in a special way, you know what I'm saying?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - All right. But I want you to know that I'm only doing this for Jahil.<eos> I can't believe I'm letting this bitch stay in my house.<eos> Hey, thank you, baby.<eos> You know I love you, right?
Yeah, well, you've got me, too.<eos> And clearly, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> This is all your fault,<eos> - and I hope you know that.<eos> - Don't even try it, Star.<eos> You put her in the house with that sick man.<eos> If you hadn't had done that, she wouldn't be here.<eos> Look, calm down and listen to me.<eos> I'm not about to calm down, Juanita!<eos> I begged you for how many years to let me have her. - I could've protected her.
My man just left me today.<eos> I ain't in the mood for you.<eos> Come home, babe, please.<eos> This-this has gone far enough...<eos> You've been embarrassed of me since day one.<eos> I mean, you just tolerate me.<eos> Me coming home is to feed your guilt.<eos> I'm not embarrassed by you.<eos> You are a kind, and loving spirit, despite everything that you've been through.<eos> That I've put you through.

How you gonna show up at the club so high like that, huh?<eos> I mean, do you even care about what's going on with those girls anymore, huh?<eos> How'd they do?<eos> Well, they were moved on, of course.<eos> - I'm their manager.<eos> - Hot damn. I knew it.<eos> But listen, but you ain't ready.<eos> - You ain't ready for them.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> No, 'cause whatever's going on with you has got more to do than what's going on with some dude.
This is what happened last time on Star...<eos> I signed you all up as a four-girl group.<eos> So you can't perform without me.<eos> Big Trouble!<eos> Jahil and Eva, they've been playing us this whole time.<eos> I need my outsides to match my insides.<eos> Why would you pay somebody to mutilate what God gave you?
I, uh...<eos> I didn't know what you like for breakfast.<eos> Thanks, but no thanks.<eos> - I don't do carbs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Yeah, are you, uh...<eos> So why you want to do that-that whole surgery thing, anyway?<eos> So, Mama told you about the surgery.
Come with me, baby.<eos> It's the best I can do.<eos> You could come with me.<eos> You could protect me from all the creepy drunk dudes.<eos> Why are you making a joke of this?<eos> I'm not.<eos> What is it that you're trying to do?<eos> I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I love you, too?
- I can't pass up a tour.<eos> It's gonna be dives the whole way.<eos> It's everything that we've worked for.<eos> I wouldn't ask you to give up a season.<eos> I know exactly what kind of girls are on the road, trying to get wired by a pro athlete, but I wouldn't do that.<eos> Because I trust you.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't you just hear me say I love you?
And nobody's gonna stop us.<eos> Nobody.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I got another kid I don't know about?<eos> Detective Batista called.<eos> He got some more questions, I'm guessing about you.<eos> What, you're the best character witness they could find?<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> I got you, Jahil.<eos> Who got you out?
- I'm tired of her Jesus praising...<eos> - You know what?<eos> She's walking in there to try to save my ass, all right?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just pissed.<eos> Star has everyone in that salon turned against me.<eos> And you.<eos> You know she's the one who called the cops on you, Jahil.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Star's a cold, calculating bitch, but she ain't gonna set me up for murder.<eos> Ever since we tricked her into getting me back on the group, she wants you out, and she has everyone wanting that.
- You brought me back to my roots!<eos> You brought me back to my music.<eos> You brought me back to me!<eos> I opened myself up to you.<eos> How could you think that?<eos> I fell in love with you, Jahil.<eos> You saved me.<eos> How could I...?<eos> Jahil.<eos> You know I love you.
- All right. - Okay.<eos> Let's get it.<eos> It's got.<eos> ♪ We're your Dream... ♪<eos> What happened?<eos> Where's-where's Jahil?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Hey...<eos> Why aren't you at a hospital?<eos> Who did this to you?
I, uh, usually eat with him and the kids, but he's not here today, so I'm just gonna...<eos> This is actually the teachers lounge.<eos> I-I... give JJ lots of knowledge, so I'm, you know, basically a teacher.<eos> It's not the basically-a-teachers lounge.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> For what it's worth, when the 15-year-olds rejected me, they were nicer.<eos> Bunch of stuff today.<eos> Hey! Oh, well, well, look who's back.<eos> Didn't you used to be the groundskeeper?<eos> It's been a while since we've seen you in the chairs room.
- Margot Bishop.<eos> The head of the Kensington Firm.<eos> - Kensington Firm?<eos> - British crime family.<eos> Please tell me that my Cls haven't been working for Margot Bishop this whole time.<eos> No, they haven't.<eos> Ben just found out about Tessa.<eos> Do you not remember how it feels to be lied to by this man?<eos> He didn't lie to you.<eos> He has come through for you on every single case, and he helped find your husband.
She really is your daughter.<eos> Felicity's the one who found me in Sheffield.<eos> She told who I was, who you all were.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> So, why use her?<eos> Why not just come back and kill me?<eos> Because she wanted Kensington.<eos> So, I thought about staging a coup, but it is a family business, after all.<eos> I'm not family.<eos> And who told you about Tessa?
I'm not family.<eos> And who told you about Tessa?<eos> Your mother, of course.<eos> She was drunk.<eos> And imagine my delight at hearing the family secret...<eos> A child, a rightful heir, cruelly thrown away.<eos> So, you kill us, and Tessa's your puppet.<eos> Do I strike you as anyone's puppet?<eos> You strike me as young and entitled and not long for this world.<eos> The minute you decide to think for yourself, she'll kill you.
I might see about getting the judge to offer you a shorter sentence.<eos> And then when I get out, I could have my old job back?<eos> - No.<eos> That's, uh... no.<eos> Carol, you need to focus on finding Mockingbird.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, like I told these guys,<eos> I have no idea who Mockingbird is.<eos> He'd just sneak into my office on Fridays and leave an envelope full of cash on my desk every week.<eos> What about the money that he gave you to invest in Ethan's company?
Look, if you want your kid to have any kind of a chance, you will tell me where they are.<eos> I don't know where they are.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> Have you talked to Margot?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What about you?<eos> Have you talked to Margot Bishop?<eos> What's going on?<eos> The FBI is looking for you.
- Hey.<eos> We were so scared.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> We thought you were dead.<eos> Natalie's dead.<eos> Coyne and Hurley and Zack.<eos> Most of my squad.<eos> The only reason we're alive is... Dumb luck.<eos> So what happened to you tonight?
What happened?<eos> The Doctor took you to safety.
Doctor?<eos> Doctor!<eos> Bill, is that you?<eos> Hello, Doctor.<eos> Is that the President?<eos> It was.<eos> I take it he read the Veritas.<eos> So did I.<eos> Well... I listened to it.<eos> There's a thing on here, it reads aloud to you.
Where is Nardole?<eos> I need to know what's real and what isn't real.<eos> - Don't we all?<eos> - Don't play games.<eos> Tell me.<eos> The Veritas tells... ..of an evil demon who wants to conquer the world.<eos> But to do it, he needs to learn about it first.<eos> So, he creates a shadow world... ..a world for him to practise conquering... ..full of shadow people who think they're real.<eos> There was a thing... the shadow test?<eos> If you're in doubt whether you're real or not, the Veritas invites you to write down as many numbers as you like, of any size, in any order, and then turn the page.
- Always!<eos> Sir, step away from those doors.<eos> You'll bring them back!<eos> What do you care, Smurf?<eos> They're not even interested in you.<eos> Sir, I swear to you, step away from that lift or I will kill you!<eos> Don't, you will only make me angry.<eos> - Honey, listen to him.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because if somebody kills you and it's not me, we'll both be disappointed.
The closer you are to the source of gravity, the slower time will move.<eos> If you're standing in your garden, your head is travelling faster through time than your feet.<eos> Don't they teach you this stuff at space school?<eos> See he's raising that eyebrow?<eos> That's his sarcasm face, he's making a joke.<eos> He's been raising that eyebrow for a week.<eos> So when are you going to tell me?<eos> - Tell you what?<eos> - How I can get back up there.<eos> I already told you.

So...<eos> She's right behind you!<eos> Look, there's Bill.<eos> Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.<eos> Ten years you spent up there, chatting.<eos> You missed her by two hours!<eos> Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.<eos> He's internalising.<eos> I love it when he's Mr Volcano.<eos> The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.

Who are you?<eos> That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.<eos> Hello, little girl.<eos> We're from downstairs, and, ah... I think we're going to need your help.<eos> Sorry you have to stay out here.<eos> You'd frighten the children.<eos> Where am I?<eos> How did I...?<eos> Sorry, I... I can't remember...<eos> The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.<eos> They go viral.<eos> Why?<eos> They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.<eos> No.<eos> Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?<eos> What do you remember?<eos> There's quite a lot!<eos> I was down there for ten years.<eos> And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
Aren't they?<eos> It's an actual tear... but it shouldn't be.<eos> Engine oil?<eos> No.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.<eos> We've found it.<eos> Oh, hello, my dear.<eos> My God, you were so boring for all those years... but it was worth every day of it... for this!<eos> Bill, don't let him upset you.
Nardole, Alit! Hazran says the food's ready.<eos> Right. Come on.<eos> Let's go and find the others.<eos> - You know Hazran?<eos> - Yes. I think she likes you.<eos> She's only human.<eos> Promise you won't go?<eos> Promise.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Does that feel dead to you?
You got yourselves a real puzzle.<eos> Look, I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> You can go.<eos> Well, that was a waste of time.<eos> - Look who's joining us.<eos> - Hey, team.<eos> I may have found something interesting.<eos> It's a call Weckler made from jail to his daughter the day before he was murdered.<eos> Are they keeping you fed, honey?
So the hardliners in Tehran bankroll Vaughn du Clark... And Max Rager.<eos> Why?<eos> So they could infect the movers and shakers first.<eos> These athletic zombies would have no problem chasing down couch potatoes.<eos> It all seems obvious when you say it out loud like that.<eos> Mmm, time to take the edge off this old boy.<eos> Yep.<eos> See that vein in his neck?<eos> It becomes more distinct when he leans forward.<eos> Where's that phone Blaine gave you?
Don E and I are being held hostage by zombie hunters at wham bams gun range.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Slow down.<eos> That's a lot to process.<eos> Process this!<eos> They're starving Don E until he turns Romero and broadcasting it on a livestream.<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something big.<eos> Just get here.<eos> Look I know your situation may look dire here, Stacey, but you have options.<eos> Sure, and one of those options involves you being buried alive in this overpriced box...<eos> But the other leaves you alive, and provides you with what I'm proud to say is a... Truly remarkable business opportunity.
Trying to kidnap my granddaughter?<eos> Baz asked me to take her to school.<eos> I wanted him to take her.<eos> She hasn't seen him in four days.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> He asked me to do it. Go get dressed.<eos> What's she supposed to do with two left shoes?<eos> Please tell baz to call.<eos> Consistency is crucial to a child.<eos> She barely knows you.
Hey.<eos> Lena, this is daddy's friend, Lucy.<eos> Come here.<eos> Yo, man, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.<eos> Another epic screwup.<eos> Do you have any idea how lucky you are that Nicky called me first?<eos> I'm guessing there was enough coke in that apartment for a nice federal charge.<eos> Yeah, well, I've got a headache, smurf.<eos> Why did you get her to hit me so hard?<eos> I wish she would have smacked the shit out of you.
I'm supposed to know that Lucy was staying with you?<eos> She's not staying with me.<eos> She's here for a couple of days.<eos> I was doing you a favor, man.<eos> Yeah, well, then do me a favor and, you know, have my back next time.<eos> Shoot me a text before you walk in the door.<eos> Lucy seemed pretty pissed.<eos> You smell like a bonfire.<eos> I didn't have time to shower.<eos> All that smoke inhalation can't be good for you.
- What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We went through all of this for a non-proposal cactus picnic?<eos> Damn it, Winston.<eos> My girl deserves the grandest proposal ever, okay?<eos> And that cannot be rushed.<eos> - That is actually sweet.<eos> - That's not sweet.<eos> I te... Here's a phase for you:<eos> when I throw you off the cliff into the ocean.
So, do children still like marbles or...?<eos> - Are you really our uncle?<eos> - How old are you?<eos> What's your net worth?<eos> What's the deal with you and Uncle Donald?<eos> Is that fork real silver?<eos> Can I have it? - How come you never visit?<eos> - 'Cause you're so old and moving is so hard?<eos> You owe us, like, a lot of birthday presents.<eos> You used to be a big deal! Whatever happened to you?
Your map's got us going the long way.<eos> I can probably find a shortcut if you just let me...<eos> The shortest distance between two points isn't always a straight line.<eos> Okay, but yes, it is, so if you just go...<eos> Driving!<eos> Shortcut achieved!<eos> He'll thank me later.<eos> Oh, you kids'll be the death of me.<eos> Dewey!<eos> Dewey will be the death of you!
I hate this place.<eos> Try the royal map-maker.<eos> Love ya.<eos> So she's only shown herself to me that I know of.<eos> Maybe I'm tuned into her ghost channel or something, or... maybe it has something to do with this.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?<eos> I know my daughter. She's trying to protect us.<eos> Seeing her like that would be... very upsetting for her mother and me, but she led you to this for a reason.
I had a life before you came. I had no idea if you even would come.<eos> Fillory is my home, and I care about it.<eos> - So you became a terrorist?<eos> - We're not violent.<eos> I'd call your ex-boyfriend trying to strangle me<eos> - a little bit violent!<eos> We were close, yes, but hurting people was never the plan.<eos> - I have no idea who you are.<eos> - I'm your wife.<eos> - Because your father made you. - I could've walked out of here
Hey. Yolanda, can you come downstairs and help me with the rest of the groceries?<eos> You got two arms, bitch.<eos> I've been on this diet for three days. I'm a little hangry. Great.<eos> So you'll help me?<eos> You got two ears, bitch, I said no.<eos> (quietly) Yolanda...<eos> Yolanda, we have a situation.<eos> Alan's leaving you for someone thinner?
You know, Matt Damon is so over.<eos> You remember that Martian movie?<eos> I mean, he's up there for a whole year and doesn't see one Martian!<eos> Gabi, are we here to pick up Matt Damon or Matt Danon?<eos> - Do you really not know?<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> - Gabi, you lied to me.<eos> - Oh, so you do know.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Josh specifically told you to stay out of it.
- But I just...<eos> - Get out!<eos> I did it!<eos> Mr. Danon, you have a visitor.<eos> I do?<eos> If it's that crazy chauffeur girl...<eos> Josh.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I only came down here to explain to you that my chef took my car without my permission, and she picked you up from the airport without my knowledge.

(scoffs) I knew it wasn't me.<eos> Look, Gabi, I'm just gonna say it.<eos> I keep having this feeling that Josh knows nothing about this - and bringing me here was your idea.<eos> - W... what?<eos> You think I would risk my relationship with Josh by interfering in this very fragile father-son relationship?<eos> Well, you did it before when you picked me up at the airport.<eos> Exactly, yes. So what, you think I'd do it again?<eos> What am I? A fool?<eos> Matt, Josh felt so bad about what happened before and he wanted a second chance to connect with you.<eos> So that's why he brought you here.
Happy Valentine's Day, Josh.<eos> ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪<eos> ♪ I'm in love with you ♪<eos> ♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪<eos> ♪ That you love me too ♪<eos> Ms. Wilson?<eos> Dammit!<eos> Locked the windows, forgot the door.<eos> I, uh... I brought your wedding dress back.<eos> So the magic dress told you, "No way," huh?
I know it's crazy, right?<eos> So... you two gay marry each other yet?<eos> 'Cause that was the rumor in high school.<eos> Lizette, if we married each other, don't you think we would ask you to be our bridesmaid?<eos> Nope.<eos> Damn it.<eos> You know what's crazy, Lizette?<eos> That you didn't ask us to be your bridesmaids.<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Well, because all of our lives, you've shoved every great thing that ever happened to you in our faces.
And I mean a dozen, not ten with powdered sugar on your tie.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I am Josh's bitch.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> It's because you let him walk all over you.<eos> I laid the law down with Josh on day one.<eos> I can't lay down the law.<eos> I'm not confident and manly like you.<eos> Help me, Yolanda!<eos> Well, if you want Josh to appreciate you, you gotta show him you have other job prospects.
I was so mad at you, Yolanda, I didn't realize that I could actually use this whole situation to my favor.<eos> All I have to do is make Josh think Dante wants me, then he'll cave and offer me everything I deserve.<eos> - Elliot!<eos> - The game is afoot!<eos> Okay, thanks again so much for doing this, Dante.<eos> When he comes in here, just turn your chair away from us and try not to laugh.<eos> Righty-oh.<eos> Elliot...<eos> Now, give it to me straight.<eos> Are you still my publicist or did Dante steal you away from me?
- Ugh, Gabi...<eos> - Do the right thing.<eos> Fine!<eos> The limo awaits, girls!<eos> - Lizette...<eos> Let's not keep it a-waitin'.<eos> - Sofia!<eos> - See ya!<eos> Lizette!<eos> Your fiancé is cheating on you!
Into... a promotion!<eos> Do you listen to anything I say?<eos> Like... do you even know that I wanna be a writer?<eos> I do now.<eos> Oh my god! How am I even friends with you?<eos> Why am I even friends with you?<eos> I don't understand why you're getting so mad, I do bad stuff all the time!<eos> This isn't... it's... this isn't like any other time, Gabi, this is about my career!<eos> As a writer!<eos> Gabi, I told you how important this was to me and... and... now I may never get a promotion, and not only that, come Monday,
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry to commandeer your vessel, Captain, but I'm afraid for what I have planned, you can't be in Storybrooke.<eos> Emma, are you there?<eos> Gideon... he sent me away. I would never leave you. What the hell do I have to do?<eos> Kill the Black Fairy.<eos> Did she harm you?<eos> She toughened me up.<eos> What did she do to you?
I thought she was trapped in another realm.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> You're the Savior.<eos> Your magic is the only thing strong enough to not only slice into her realm, but to allow me to at last defeat her.<eos> So, you tried to kill me because you didn't believe that I would help you get to another realm to get back to her?<eos> Seemed like a... good plan at the time.<eos> In retrospect, perhaps not.<eos> I thought I could channel your powers via the sword to open a portal between worlds.<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> After everything I've done to you, you should just walk away.
What the devil...?<eos> So, where the hell is the Jolly Roger?<eos> The sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can kill you.<eos> That's just it... this isn't my realm.<eos> What?<eos> Then where are we?<eos> I'm not sure. Something must have gone wrong.<eos> "Gone wrong"?<eos> Don't you know how to use a magic bean?<eos> You think of the place you want to go, and it takes you.
Such powerful toys are not meant for such disobedient boys.<eos> Mother.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I led you here... just as I led your friend to my key.<eos> This whole thing... it was a test, wasn't it?<eos> From the moment you arrived, you were supposed to be different, Gideon.<eos> You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!

I'll never look at Spider-Man again the same way, but I'm fine.<eos> Rumple, where's our boy?<eos> Gideon led Emma to the creature and left her to die.<eos> I thought you were helping him.<eos> I was, but Dark One Junior had different plans. He played me.<eos> He came to you for help, though.<eos> Belle, I know you want to believe the best in him, but it's like you said...<eos> evil is not born, it is made, and that is exactly what the Black Fairy did to him.<eos> Careful with your accusations, Ms. Swan.<eos> May I remind you... I saved your life tonight.
D'Andre thinks<eos> Barmuk's probably laying low at his girlfriend's place on 6th Avenue.<eos> Anna and I are about ten minutes out.<eos> I alerted LAPD.<eos> All right, Nell and I are on it.<eos> I'm going now.<eos> Irvin! Irvin!<eos> Stop right there, Sam. Irvin.<eos> Where you going, Barmuk?<eos> This doesn't concern you. Irvin.
Put the gun down.<eos> Put it down, Irvin.<eos> Come on, all right, all right, all right, all right.<eos> Irvin.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, uh, Kensi.<eos> - Hi, Nate.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hetty asked me to come in, so...<eos> Cool, did she have an assignment for you?
And there's really only one way to find out for sure.<eos> That's not really how we do things here. We?<eos> What do you mean by "we"?<eos> Now it's your decision to make?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> What do I need to do to prove it to you?<eos> Just talk to me. What do you want to know?<eos> How are you really doing?<eos> You know, with everything that happened to you?
Good morning.<eos> How'd it go with Abby?<eos> Uh... about like you'd expect.<eos> She felt terrible that she hadn't told me about her and Scott.<eos> It's true?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> She said it started with him being a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Nothing physical's happened yet.<eos> But, uh she said that, uh, she wants to see where it goes.<eos> With a guy that would stab you in the back like that?
Good work.<eos> Peter, you should see this.<eos> This is the newscast the wife said she saw.<eos> The fire is not yet contained.<eos> And we have breaking news...<eos> There.<eos> Look at the time.<eos> 7:33.<eos> According to CPD, Sarah Wheeler arrived at the site at 7:29.<eos> She told you she saw the report on the news, and then left her apartment.
Listen to me.<eos> I got the two of you and your mother outside.<eos> I started CPR on you first.<eos> And then you finally woke up.<eos> But when I reached for Lola... she... she was ice cold.<eos> Cole, I tried to save her. I did. I did.<eos> But I was too late.<eos> No, no, Cole.<eos> Listen, listen to me.<eos> Your mother loved you, son.
- Where's who?<eos> Ariel. She was just here. You didn't see her?<eos> She's still staying with you?<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Vending machine.<eos> Soda? 7 in the morning.<eos> Nice.<eos> There's real fruit juice in it. Says right here.<eos> Look, I can't sit around here all day again.<eos> That's why I asked you to hang out at my house for a few days, until I can figure things out.
- Speed?<eos> Adderall?<eos> - What? No!<eos> - Russell, tell me the truth.<eos> I take Zoloft.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Just a pill a day as prescribed.<eos> Are you taking more?<eos> You're anxious, you're having memory and focus problems on top of the physical symptoms.<eos> I told you it was a vicious cycle... the school, the games, stress.
Oh.<eos> Uh, sorry, man.<eos> You got really shitty timing, man.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> You've never seen a blow job before?<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> - Don't worry about him.<eos> I'm not gonna drown you or anything.
In a very different way.<eos> Yes.<eos> Amen.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> I heard you drive in. I thought I'd check in on ya.<eos> What are those for?<eos> Me and Deran we, we bought a bar.<eos> Yeah, it's a total dive, but we're gonna make it cool.<eos> That's why I haven't been texting you 'cause been working our balls off.
He's not doing it for the glory.<eos> All Smurf's buildings, all the palms she's greased worked for her, didn't it?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right, you stupid mermaid.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Go ahead and eat, man.<eos> So you, um, you live with Smurf?<eos> Ever since my mom died.<eos> And she took you in?
- Like, what do you mean?<eos> - I mean, like, how did you go from being so close with Manny to never seeing him again?<eos> Sometimes things go wrong, J. 20 years wrong?<eos> Listen.<eos> You remember what they were all saying about Manny at the end?<eos> The way he was, laying in his bed, babbling' bullshit all day long?<eos> That ever happens to me, you put a bullet in my head.<eos> Okay.<eos> Swear!<eos> Say, "Grandma, that ever happens to you", I'll put the bullet in your head."
- I'll let you know.<eos> I'm gonna have some credit card numbers in a couple weeks.<eos> I'm thinking 300 to 400.<eos> Security codes, solid credit limits.<eos> You can make some good money off of them.<eos> Cards are risky.<eos> You've never had a problem with credit cards before.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> What's the issue here?<eos> Smurf told you not to work with us, didn't she?
Do you need a lift?<eos> I'm faster than Uber.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm just over there.<eos> Actually, their plan makes a lot of sense.<eos> It's just, uh, premature.<eos> Kidnapping?<eos> That's not why I showed up to this thing.<eos> Well, what brought you here?
Kidnapping?<eos> That's not why I showed up to this thing.<eos> Well, what brought you here?<eos> I'm a photographer.<eos> I want to shoot a zombie.<eos> I've already got a Nessie and a Sasquatch.<eos> I thought this was my ride.<eos> Nope.<eos> This is.<eos> You encounter a beautiful elfin creature, who offers to whisk you away on her steed.
Good luck with that.<eos> She's polyandrous, and would only stay married until a hale child is born. Plus, you'd need to find a unicorn to sacrifice.<eos> You don't know.<eos> I could find a unicorn.<eos> I was talking about real life.<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Thank you, Steve.<eos> You can go.<eos> The veteran detective closes his notepad in defeat, as another suspect slips through his fingers.<eos> Any of these guys feel like a murderer to you?
It's the first day of your internship with Russell Jackson.<eos> Are you excited?<eos> With just a dash of terrified.<eos> I still can't believe he offered me the job.<eos> You saved the guy's life, I think he felt it was the least he could do.<eos> He's really scary, though.<eos> Trust me, there is way more bark than bite with him.<eos> And that was before the heart attack.<eos> I mean, he's just coming back from a three-week whale-watching cruise.<eos> If that doesn't mellow you out, nothing can.
What do we like?<eos> Honestly? None of them.<eos> Not even this?<eos> Well... tell you what, why don't we just forget about these?<eos> Why don't you just be the stylist?<eos> And you find something you like and we'll track it down, okay?<eos> Really?<eos> This is amazing!<eos> My first assignment is the inaugural ball?<eos> Yeah, and your first client carried you in her womb, so she's probably gonna go easy on you.
That way it's a purchase, not a bribe.<eos> And that's legal, right?<eos> Yes, it is, and that was my first thought.<eos> The horse costs $2 million.<eos> My God.<eos> Does it sing and dance?<eos> Besides, even buying it looks like I'm taking sides on the referendum.<eos> I spent an hour on the phone with the Russian foreign minister, stepping out the consequences of interfering with the democratic process.<eos> So I can't give them any ammunition.<eos> To knock you off your high horse.
Tomorrow, baby.<eos> I-I'm so tired, and... Yeah.<eos> I'll have all of your accessories by then, anyways.<eos> - There's more. Just gonna...<eos> - Love you.<eos> Good night.<eos> I can't wear that, right?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But she'll be so disappointed and...<eos> Babe, this is not the lanyard she made for you in the second grade.
Under duress.<eos> But she has subsequently decided to elaborate.<eos> For example, she explained that you played a direct role in getting a certain file to the resistance.<eos> - That's a lie. - Perhaps.<eos> But consider it from the iga's perspective.<eos> They aren't gonna want to take the risk that you can be trusted, not after this.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing I've always wanted...<eos> To protect this bloc.<eos> You give me what I need to take down alcala, in exchange, Helena will push you as the new proxy, and your ex-girlfriend problem will simply disappear.
Where is Gloria taking Theo right now?<eos> Why should I tell you?<eos> You should ask Nadine why this happened.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> You and your sister getting back at Nadine by taking Theo?<eos> Well, people get what they deserve.<eos> You're gonna get what you deserve, Oscar.<eos> You're going to prison.<eos> You heard of that Mexican Mafia?<eos> Gonna make sure they know you like little six-year-old boys.
He wanted to go to Mexico.<eos> My family has a ranch with goats and chickens.<eos> He would have been so happy there.<eos> I believe he would have been, but what you did is a crime.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Gloria was going to take me to a farm with real goats, so I didn't have to go to Ibiza.<eos> 'Cause then I'd never see her again.<eos> Is that what she told you?
It was kind of like a game.<eos> Can you tell us about that?<eos> I was supposed to pretend to be a mummy.<eos> Oscar rolled me into my rug.<eos> So you and Oscar were just...<eos> were just playing.<eos> It was fun.<eos> We got in a van and we met Gloria at a motel.<eos> I got to watch cartoons.<eos> And what did Gloria tell you?
Got a sec?<eos> I'm checking in on Omar Abbas' case.<eos> Any particular reason?<eos> Media found out CIU was investigating, so now, in addition to all the calls I'm getting from the feds...<eos> The press are all over you.<eos> What's that saying? No such thing as bad publicity?<eos> This from a woman who knows that isn't true.<eos> You having a problem with us looking into this?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just wondering why your dad brought it to you.
What 911 call?<eos> They played it over and over.<eos> There was a man saying there was sarin in a duffel bag<eos> - in the trunk of a taxi cab.<eos> - Did you recognize his voice?<eos> No, but they wouldn't believe me.<eos> They said I could disappear and no one would ever know.<eos> They held me there for days.<eos> They wouldn't let me sleep, barely gave me any food or water.<eos> They tortured you.
- I'm not under arrest.<eos> What happened, Paul?<eos> Did you get cold feet when you got to the bank?<eos> Leave the sarin in the taxi?<eos> You called the authorities because you didn't want innocent people to get hurt.<eos> Well, someone did get hurt...<eos> Omar Abbas.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> You don't want to leave, Paul.<eos> We have every reason to believe the feds are onto you by now.
An important one. I'll be good at it.<eos> Why couldn't you just be honest with me?<eos> Why is there always an agenda with you?<eos> That's not just me, Bug.<eos> That's everyone.<eos> - That's Wallace.<eos> You have no idea about our relationship.<eos> I love him.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And he loves you, too.

My plan was to blow up a mosque, not that mosque.<eos> The best way to defend this country is to eradicate all Muslims before they eradicate us.<eos> But innocent or guilty, Rodney Landon needs to stay in prison.<eos> A rumor started that Landon was getting out for snitching on other inmates.<eos> A skinhead attacked him. Landon stabbed the guy with a shiv.<eos> He isn't getting out of prison anytime soon.<eos> Bad guy stays off the street.<eos> Sounds like a win to me.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Part of what he loves about you is that you're my daughter.
- With a shiv.<eos> You stabbed your unarmed assailant six times.<eos> The skinhead who jumped me, he has an interesting story about an ADA who told him I was getting released early because I was a snitch.<eos> That's why he attacked me.<eos> My trial is this week.<eos> My lawyer will be putting that charming Neo-Nazi on the stand, and he'll identify you as that ADA.<eos> Gerald Harris?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> When I asked you this morning about your next review, you didn't think to mention that one to me?
I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> What about Claire Harris?<eos> You mean to hurt her?<eos> Who is that?<eos> I've never seen that woman.<eos> Maybe this will jog your memory.<eos> You mean the lady that was killed by her husband?<eos> Maybe she wasn't killed by her husband.<eos> Maybe you did it when you broke in the house.<eos> She woke up, she surprised you, you hit her over the head, knocking her over the balcony.
His wife, Claire?<eos> This woman here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did Gerald invite you over?<eos> No, I had followed him home once.<eos> I wanted to see where he lived.<eos> Well, you're not too big on boundaries, huh, Paul?<eos> I was in a dark place back then.<eos> I was closeted, depressed.<eos> Being gay in the military during "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" will do that to you.
Eeeeeeeyaaaa!<eos> Ha! Ha! Once again BMO comes out on top!<eos> - Bzzt! - BMO!<eos> BMO, you okay?<eos> Ship: Signal received.<eos> XJ-7-7 requests transport.<eos> Both: [ Gasps ] Susan!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Finn.<eos> Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up.
[ Singsong voice ] What's the magic password?<eos> Please, Vinny.<eos> You got it, boss!<eos> This super-skin costs 15 million crypto-coins.<eos> Give it to me, Vinny.<eos> I'm beautiful.<eos> BMO?<eos> BMO!<eos> Dang it, Vinny!<eos> I told you I would BRB!
Ha!<eos> Cha cha cha cha cha!<eos> I'm gonna just go yank off his goggles.<eos> [ Growls ] They thought of everything.<eos> But who is "they"?<eos> Who's running the show?<eos> Humans!<eos> [ Laughs ] Get broadsword.<eos> [ Electronic music plays ] So, you really don't want to come with us?<eos> You sure you don't want me to milk you up a fresh new style?
BMO, I'm sorry I smashed up your world.<eos> I smashed it up because I love you.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> Well, m-maybe I could visit.<eos> Oh, Jake, hug me tighter!<eos> Okay!<eos> Of course I won't go!<eos> I would miss you guys too much.<eos> I tried to make a Finn and Jake in the goggles world, but they were scary.<eos> I love you, too, BMO.
Who are you?<eos> Uh, my name's Finn.<eos> Are you my m...<eos> It is you.<eos> Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're alive!<eos> Minerva-bot, hug my son.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> [ Laughs ] My boy, baby Finn!<eos> Oh, you're so big.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were 6.875 kilograms, and now look at you!
Your cloud is freaking us all out!<eos> Sweetie, you forced my hand.<eos> This is the only way I can protect you.<eos> You're only doing this because I said I wouldn't stay.<eos> So I'll stay.<eos> Just promise to stop messing with people.<eos> I'm helping people.<eos> I know about helping people.<eos> Finn, you... you grew up to be a helper, too?<eos> If your world taught you to behave like that, maybe it's not all bad.
Someone moved in, made a deal ahead of us.<eos> How?<eos> I thought we were the only ones who knew.<eos> So did I.<eos> Trouble is, I'm not entirely sure who it is we're up against.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Keegan was only given a code name...<eos> Mockingbird.<eos> Mockingbird?<eos> Does it mean anything to you?
Yes, well, thanks to your cowboy stunt, now she knows we're onto her.<eos> And she's on the loose, armed, and dangerous.<eos> Yeah, I know. I trained her.<eos> Can you train me?<eos> - Yeah, of course, darling.<eos> - No!<eos> We are on caution protocol until she is found and neutralized.<eos> And I'm upping security until then.<eos> Tessa, I'm so sorry. Your mum used to be fun, I swear.<eos> Is this a joke to you?
We need to know who.<eos> How'd you find this?<eos> You asked Alice to work with you exclusively.<eos> I needed to make sure you were on the up-and-up.<eos> So you had the FBI spy on me.<eos> Inquire about.<eos> Your record isn't exactly spotless.<eos> I don't do that stuff anymore.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> Even so, that can put you in jail.
Good.<eos> More Margot.<eos> I'm with you there.<eos> I'll go.<eos> It's fine. I got it.<eos> Someone's got a bit of an attitude.<eos> She thought she'd be putting criminals away here, not taking orders from them.<eos> Well, then, she's entirely missed the point of becoming a detective, hasn't she?<eos> How's that?<eos> People hire you to find out the truth.
What, because he's good now?<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> Ben is exactly like me.<eos> He's just better at hiding it.<eos> Before, maybe.<eos> Before when?<eos> This morning?<eos> When he asked me to break in to your ex-fiance's office?<eos> He asked you to break into Ethan's office?
For what?<eos> Well, for treating me like a real person.<eos> I will be there for you when you get out of here.<eos> Always.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> Sometimes, I'm the only one he'll talk to.<eos> But, at times, he's inapproachable even to me.<eos> Like the time when he pulled out one of his eyes.<eos> Hey, Da Vinci, lookin' good!<eos> I told you to call me Van gogh.
Look, your wife's filed for divorce, hired me to collect any damning information.<eos> That's the only reason I'm here.<eos> I doubt she'll want a divorce now.<eos> Well that's up to her, isn't it?<eos> Why don't you come to my house?<eos> Hear for yourself.<eos> Okay, it's true, all right?<eos> I did, I was thinking about it for a while.<eos> You know, our lawyer told me that I should hire somebody and get information.<eos> Okay, I believe you, and I believe our lawyer's a spineless cocksucker, and that she had nothin' to do with it, but I'm askin' you to tell him that.
That would be me.<eos> Kesler.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The first time I tried to kill ya, this woulda slowed me down, but now.<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> Death is an ugly thing.<eos> You were an accident.<eos> Not part of the plan.<eos> Who were you fighting with?<eos> He hurt you.
You know, the last couple days,<eos> I felt more connected to you than I ever have, but to feel your pain, to know that you were in trouble, it's.<eos> A painter friend of mine told me to feel love deeply was to be able to do that.<eos> Empathy.<eos> It's beyond anything normal.<eos> You're not drinking either?<eos> No, I, I... who are you?<eos> I'm your husband.<eos> And I love... that's right, you are now.<eos> I loved you before they put you away.
He's trapped in my remains now.<eos> And where is that?<eos> You'll only find that out when it's too late.<eos> I should thank you, Dwight.<eos> I sent the detective and the other orderly out for you before, and they failed.<eos> Now you've come to me.<eos> A plague.<eos> This body's dead.<eos> But what of the soul?<eos> So shall you be here, freed from the demons of your mind that tormented you, and resting in peace until that judgment day when god shall reclaim you as his own, Dwight stroud.
Goodbye, Dwight.<eos> You won't see me anymore, you're beyond listening to me.<eos> If you do get free of Finch, then you'll be truly alone because his personality is the only sanity you have left.<eos> I saw you talkin' to him.<eos> No sense pretending he's not real, he's in my mind.<eos> Well I'm glad the pretense is over.<eos> I'll tell you what I know.<eos> I know you're not what you seem.<eos> You tore your eyes out the night I escaped and now you have eyes.<eos> When I saw you at the gallery, you acted like you didn't know me at first.
You would've stopped me a long time ago if you wanted to.<eos> You're too selfish to care about anything but yourself and the life you stole from the real Van gogh,<eos> the one who was my only true friend.<eos> Unless you'd rather go back to your original body also.<eos> You know me well enough, but don't think your desires are much different from mine.<eos> You may not have to dig as deeply this time.<eos> It's time we met face-to-face.<eos> My true shape of what you knew as Finch.<eos> I am the soul we are both sharing.<eos> Dwight, it's that pain that connects you to your old life.
the one who was my only true friend.<eos> Unless you'd rather go back to your original body also.<eos> You know me well enough, but don't think your desires are much different from mine.<eos> You may not have to dig as deeply this time.<eos> It's time we met face-to-face.<eos> My true shape of what you knew as Finch.<eos> I am the soul we are both sharing.<eos> Dwight, it's that pain that connects you to your old life.<eos> 'Cause that's all our life was, pain.<eos> It's the pain that forced you insane so you could forget it.
That's where you left me when you killed me.<eos> You meant to kill yourself afterwards, but you went crazy before you could finish.<eos> No.<eos> Think of anything else you would force yourself to forget?<eos> Anything as horrible?<eos> No.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I can never remember this life.<eos> I know.<eos> And that's why I forgave you.
Anything as horrible?<eos> No.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I can never remember this life.<eos> I know.<eos> And that's why I forgave you.<eos> Every single<eos> time I came to see you at the hospital.<eos> I can never let you touch me or you'd remember all the pain.<eos> It would destroy you before I could have you back.
And I know I'll kill Ellen eventually if I go on living.<eos> But I want you to add one more thing to it first.<eos> Don't touch him.<eos> He's at the point of death.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What are you?<eos> Why would you let him do this?<eos> If you had touched him, you'd have found out.<eos> He saved you from that and perhaps much worse.
Which is exactly why I need you.<eos> You know the area better than anyone else.<eos> You're good with a gun.<eos> I ain't just good.<eos> I'm the best.<eos> Which is why I need you.<eos> So this is, what, a treasure map?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Well, what's the treasure?<eos> She recognizes you.
You want to come on in here so I can tell you what for.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Dude, we're in a posse with the Lone Ranger.<eos> Yeah, well, don't get too excited.<eos> They're not gonna be happy with us when this is all over.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> We're not gonna let 'em arrest Jesse James.<eos> I'm gonna shoot him myself.<eos> What?<eos> Well, one, you gave Bass your word, and, two, does the casualness with which we talk about murder ever bother you?
Yeah, it's just... you're risking your life when shooting him on sight would be a little bit easier.<eos> Who the hell ever said...<eos> "easy" and "right" were the same thing?<eos> Look, I'm not saying that I'm some sort of hero or anything.<eos> I've killed several men.<eos> But the thing is that I see them every time I close my eyes.<eos> Every time I look in the mirror.<eos> And I think you know exactly... what I'm talking about.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> It bother you that not long ago you were in bondage, and now, here you are, fighting so hard for your old masters' law?
- Oh, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just... tired.<eos> It took its toll on you, the things Rittenhouse told you, the things they must have made you do.<eos> So you found a way out.<eos> Um, Pilot Whitmore was lost in the operation.<eos> Her body couldn't be recovered due to the unmanageable circumstances described by... the other pilot, Anthony Bruhl.<eos> We lost her.<eos> She's gone.<eos> You faked your own death and hid in the past, where Rittenhouse would never be able to find you.
"Those flicks are a bunch of crap."<eos> Because nobody is that good.<eos> And then we meet this Bass guy, and he really was that good.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess.<eos> You want me to do what?<eos> - No.<eos> - Rufus...<eos> Wyatt, I can't do that.<eos> I'm not helping you... kill someone else.
Is there any chance he didn't do it?<eos> No.<eos> What you know won't pay for this cup of coffee.<eos> It's what you can prove in court that counts.<eos> And without the knife, all I can prove. Is they had drinks together.<eos> Why?<eos> What? Why did beckett kill cody?<eos> You know, technically, motive isn't an element of murder.<eos> Well, it's part of a good narrative.<eos> Did you ever think that beckett beat you on the arson case. Because he just told a better story?
You're going to love it here.<eos> - I'm not staying, Lindsey.<eos> - You have to.<eos> You'll miss her if you leave.<eos> She's about to come out.<eos> You're not staying either.<eos> We're going home right now.<eos> No, mother. Cyndi needs me.<eos> I have to be here for her.<eos> What have these people done to you?
- You have to.<eos> You'll miss her if you leave.<eos> She's about to come out.<eos> You're not staying either.<eos> We're going home right now.<eos> No, mother. Cyndi needs me.<eos> I have to be here for her.<eos> What have these people done to you?<eos> They've given me purpose, love.<eos> I'm getting you out of here right now.
Oh, no!<eos> Cindy, come here.<eos> - Get away from her!<eos> - She's mine.<eos> Cyndi!<eos> That is your future, Cindy.<eos> I don't understand, they're supposed to love me.<eos> That's not you.<eos> None of it is.<eos> Look, I watched you on that show.
So I'm standing there, can't find a receptionist, but there's some lady sitting behind the desk like she owns it... in a nice skirt, a silk blouse, and a chartreuse belt to pull the whole damn thing together.<eos> So, I ask the lady, "Excuse me, do you know where the receptionist is?"<eos> And do you know what she said to me?<eos> She said, "I'm the receptionist."<eos> So, I said, "Uh, you can't be the receptionist because here at Welltopia, all non-medical personnel must wear scrubs."<eos> And do you know what she fixed her face to say to me?<eos> She said. "That's not true. Who told you that?"<eos> Who told me that, Pat?<eos> Okay. Fine.<eos> I may have misled you into thinking you had to wear scrubs all the time, but I like it to be clear who everyone is.
It wasn't until later that I realized that I caused her to rebel by being so strict.<eos> But if I grew up in a free-for-all, I would never have accomplished the things that I did.<eos> True.<eos> But this is about Molly.<eos> Molly is not you.<eos> Maybe this guy is the one, or maybe not and they'll break up.<eos> Either way, you need to be there for her.<eos> Trust me, it took me years to repair my relationship with Wendi.<eos> Don't make the same mistake I did.<eos> Hey, Dad, if Molly never forgives you and moves out, can I take over her room?
He knows what he's doing.<eos> I'm sure he's diagnosed this thousands of times.<eos> Right, Dad?<eos> Actually, I've never diagnosed it.<eos> Well, I'm out.<eos> Yeah, Molly, Danny could have something serious.<eos> So we're just gonna have to wait it out.<eos> I understand, Dad.<eos> But, just so you know, not everyone does.<eos> The guys on the team are not pleased with you.
Oh, damn it!<eos> You know when someone says "pee" I have to go.<eos> Check in the junk drawer under the hammer.<eos> I think the coupons might be stuffed into Brick's graduation program.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Ooh, what is this?<eos> Oh, it's the Groupon I bought for the Orson Escape Room.<eos> You guys, this expires today and I already paid for it, so we have to go.<eos> What's an escape room?<eos> You go to this place with a team, and they lock you in a room.
Dreaming is just showing off while you're asleep.<eos> Look, it was nothing.<eos> You know how dreams are.<eos> Well, apparently you don't, but most people do.<eos> Anyway, it started out with me in the bathroom and the gorilla in the next stall was handing me toilet paper.<eos> And then, all of a sudden, I'm backstage at The Sands with Frank and we're having a shrimp cocktail.<eos> And then the stage manager knocked and said it was time to go on, and Frank said,<eos> "Tell Sammy to do five more minutes."<eos> And then he asked me how my day was, and I told him, and we made out.<eos> Frank Sinatra, the original Danny Ocean, asked you about your day?
"The Catcher in the Rye"!<eos> Okay, one, two, three.<eos> "The Catcher in the Rye"!<eos> Yes! Give me a high five!<eos> So, how was your day?<eos> What do you mean, how was my day?<eos> You were there. We beat the Donahues.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't know.<eos> You're dreaming about guys asking you about your day, and I know we've been pretty busy lately, and I don't always ask, so I thought, you know, maybe I should.
I'm eating ramen out of a Tupperware.<eos> You should come to my house.<eos> You'd go nuts.<eos> I figured if you're gonna have a maid, you got to have a good vacuum, so I sent Mike to the place with the biggest inventory at the best prices.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> What happened to you?
Can I help you?<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm April.<eos> I'm looking for temporary housing.<eos> My ex-husband is staying there.<eos> It's totally against the rules, so I'm supposed to keep a lookout for some jerky R.A. named Dan.<eos> I'm Dan.<eos> Ah ha ha! Welcome, ladies.<eos> I know I speak for Hutch and Kenny when I say mi 'Bago es su 'Bago.<eos> I told you we were gonna get thrown out, but you didn't listen, because you always play everything so fast and loose!
Dad's all better now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He pooped!<eos> You what?<eos> Yeah, the darndest thing is something was gumming up the works.<eos> So don't go eyeballing my microwaves. I've still got a few miles left on me.<eos> So, you're perfectly fine?<eos> You went to the john, and now you have no trouble walking at all?<eos> Feel better than ever.<eos> Just like I told you, son. You don't have to worry about me.
I do, but you know what?<eos> Meemaw.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, Christine?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi, it's Ken.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Sorry it took me so long to call you back.
Sorry it took me so long to call you back.<eos> Hey, but you're here. That's amazing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So listen, uh, do you have any plans for lunch?<eos> Lunch?<eos> No.<eos> Well, my daughters are fixing me lunch. Why don't you come over?<eos> Uh, I don't want to impose.<eos> You're not imposing.<eos> How about I pick you up around noon?
How do I look?<eos> Oh, okay by me. Yeah.<eos> - Appointment done.<eos> - Meemaw, please.<eos> Have something to eat.<eos> The steaks are a buck.<eos> I'm not hungry right now.<eos> Why not?<eos> Is there something wrong with you?<eos> No, I just... I promised Mom that I would take you to the doctor.
We found her in the woods.<eos> I don't care if she's setting the teachers' lounge on fire.<eos> You're her brother, and you need to have her back.<eos> And just in case...<eos> I actually do care if you set the teachers' lounge on fire. - Mnh-mnh!<eos> - No cellphones.<eos> I have rights.<eos> Isn't that cute?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Whoever told you that is not helping you.
Don, what can we do to make you reconsider?<eos> That's easy...<eos> Outbid the cash offer that's already come in.<eos> Or you could take a look at this.<eos> Is it a pile of cash?<eos> You can't put a price tag on these.<eos> It's a box of your old stuff.<eos> We found it in the basement.<eos> I haven't seen this baseball glove in 30 years.<eos> - Takes you back, doesn't it?
Okay, that's how a garage sale works.<eos> This is a tag sale, so whoever has the tag gets the sale.<eos> And since I have the tag, who do you think gets the sale?<eos> Do you think it's you?<eos> 'Cause it's not. It's me.<eos> Okay, pumpkin?<eos> Hey, if you're gonna be in my selfie, the least you can do is smile.<eos> Or at least do something more flattering with those legs.<eos> Another universal sign coming at you.<eos> I'll crop you out.
You and Chloe should really talk this out on our double date tonight. - Our what?<eos> - Stan planned it.<eos> We're having dinner at one restaurant and the dessert at another.<eos> "Can he be any more fun?" I ask, but the answer is clearly no.<eos> Okay, before you break out into "I Am Sixteen Going on Seventeen," you need to know that I won't be there.<eos> Oh, why not? I'm not having dinner with Chloe Brown Mueller, but if you would like to have a single date with Stan, be my guest.<eos> I guess it's boys' night out.<eos> Going big tonight.<eos> I should take an extra Zantac.<eos> What happened to the pony pencil case I gave you?
I know what to do.<eos> When I was her age, this girl Erin Smith teased me every day.<eos> She called me a "lezzie" because she thought that I was less than.<eos> That is not what Erin meant.<eos> Then one day, Erin pushed me too far, so I walked right up to her and punched her in the nose.<eos> After that, the bullying stopped.<eos> So if someone's treating me badly, I should punch them?<eos> Right in the nose.<eos> Thanks, Taylor.<eos> When she called you "lezzie," was that when you had short hair and were playing softball?
And don't let anybody cop a Valentine's feel.<eos> Uncomfortable. I'm leaving.<eos> Text us every hour.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Yeah, but that whole cop-a-feel thing really freaked me out.<eos> Just wanted to offer you half.<eos> You sure you don't want to step on it first, maybe run it over with your car?<eos> Why didn't you do anything for me for Valentine's Day?<eos> You told me not to.<eos> I also told you that the big forks don't go with the little forks in the silverware tray, but that never stopped you.
She fell and sprained her ankle.<eos> Let me talk to one of Amy's moms.<eos> None of them are there?<eos> What do you mean, no one's there?<eos> Don't move.<eos> We are coming to get you right now.<eos> Taylor told me you talked to a parent.<eos> She told me the same thing.<eos> She played us, Greg.<eos> It's extremely disappointing when a family member withholds important information from you.
I've come around on this. Great job, Greg.<eos> If Anna-Kat puts herself to bed every night, that frees up 10 extra hours a week.<eos> I could re-read Proust, but in French.<eos> Why am I so attracted to bad boys? Ow!<eos> I hit the pointy part!<eos> I told the kids a hundred times to close the cabinet doors.<eos> Forget the Lamaze breathing. Just swear, Greg.<eos> Any swear word plus the word "face" works really well.<eos> You know I don't like to swear.<eos> And that's why the kids don't listen to you.
Fine.<eos> I'll put a shirt on him, but his pants are coming off.<eos> So, Viv and Alan are really getting divorced, huh?<eos> Isn't that crazy?<eos> It is weird that she's the one who left.<eos> Viv should be at home, and Alan should be holed up at the Four Seasons.<eos> Or the Red Roof Inn.<eos> That's where Greg would go.<eos> That is so sad.<eos> Remind me when Greg leaves you to give him some of my hotel points.
Can we do "Madeline"?<eos> This is new.<eos> And in French.<eos> Daddy got it for me.<eos> I can't wait until you finish your class and can read to me in French.<eos> Oh, sweetie, I don't think I'll ever get good enough to read a book like this.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> You can do anything.<eos> Right there.<eos> There's the moment when telling your kids they can do anything comes back to bite you on the ass.
He's like a man mixed with an infant.<eos> He's a "minfant."<eos> Don't judge Billy.<eos> Remember, if he hadn't taken me in when I got kicked off campus for a minor infraction...<eos> - You were streaking.<eos> - No. I was sitting naked in the fountain, drinking sangria.<eos> "Streaking" implies running.<eos> You're right. I feel silly.<eos> And if Billy hadn't rented me a room,<eos> I might have dropped out, moved home, never signed up for your class, never met you, and our children would've never been born.
He'll park his food truck in the driveway and stay in that.<eos> Great.<eos> Why don't we just pull the couch onto the front lawn to complete the white-trash tableau.<eos> Just for that, I'm gonna watch that video of you dancing.<eos> I can't believe Billy's coming to visit.<eos> You should be excited to see him.<eos> He's your godfather.<eos> All he does is terrorize me.<eos> We've been in a seven-year prank war, and he's the only one doing the pranks.<eos> I will never be happier than the day I saw you with shaved eyebrows.
Why?<eos> I'm just not up for pretending to be one of those people.<eos> It's not me.<eos> And if I go, it's like I'm giving in.<eos> But it's Doris' charity.<eos> She still isn't even sure what the charity is for... or what charity is.<eos> The whole family is going.<eos> You're part of the family, so you're going.<eos> Fine.<eos> What is with you?
- Just finished.<eos> - Great.<eos> Cooper, time to go.<eos> But before you do, head downstairs - and load the dishwasher.<eos> - For real?<eos> A chore is manual labor that you do around the house.<eos> Hmm, interesting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> We're not checking in on you, just saying hi.
She needs to get a life.<eos> - Granola bar?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mnh, no bueno.<eos> Hey, I don't know what you do in your house.<eos> - Oh, it's more of an estate.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Well, there are several houses on the property.<eos> It's called "Juniper Hill."<eos> And there's this dude who welcomes you at the gate.
I should never have lied.<eos> Nana was right.<eos> If you're feeling unsure about anything at all, you can always ring a neighbor's doorbell.<eos> The Lintons live there, the Sealanders there.<eos> They're the Bumgarners.<eos> Best skip that house.<eos> Whenever our recycling bin overflows, I put it in theirs.<eos> They've caught me like three times.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Okay, let's say a van pulls up and a very nice person says he has your favorite type of candy and invites you inside.
Katie?<eos> Katie Otto? We never see you in the pool.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They've never eaten a French-toast stick in their life.<eos> Why don't you go in first and show me how fun it is?<eos> No!<eos> I'm only doing it with you.<eos> Come on, Katie.<eos> Why are you letting these skinny idiots psych you out?
Just like there's a ban on us going to Murray's Frozen Yogurt because you had into a disagreement over the definition of "unlimited toppings."<eos> I was one punch away from a free yogurt.<eos> But we don't go there out of respect for you.<eos> But it looks like you have no respect for me.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> In my defense, you weren't even supposed to find out.<eos> Typical Katie Otto.<eos> Excuse me? You know, when I was just getting to know you, I thought your whole "me first" thing was charming.<eos> But it's not.<eos> You tune out anything that doesn't have to do with you.
I know.<eos> But the difference is now, I want to want to.<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't take an interest in what you were working on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That means a lot. I'm not even going to mention what's going on with me, because that would be selfish.<eos> And this moment is about you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Maybe if I close my eyes and clear my mind, the line will come back to me.<eos> Gee, Katie, you seem kind of blue.<eos> What's going on with you?
I was finally making some progress with the ladies in this town, and now I'm back to square one.<eos> I don't want to be your favorite anymore.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it makes Taylor and Oliver mad, and then they're not nice to me.<eos> So I did things to make you upset, and nothing worked.<eos> So I lifted your shirt, hoping you wouldn't like me anymore.<eos> Sweetpea... I will always like you.<eos> I will always love you.<eos> But if I put you in a bad spot with your brother and sister... I'm sorry.
Please tell me you forced Chad to be partners with Dave Kim.<eos> Quite the opposite, Goldfarb.<eos> Chad came to me.<eos> Made me swear to keep it a secret, too.<eos> Something about feelings and friendship, I don't know.<eos> I'm not your remembering things secretary, Chad Kremp!<eos> That snake is cheating on me with my mortal enemy, who is actually a great guy and another friend.<eos> I sympathize.<eos> Tennis is a lot like marriage.<eos> It's long, and it's boring, and eventually, she leaves you for a handsome Latin man who was just supposed to re-tile your bathroom.
I paged Leon, and... I hid all of the stinky bottles in the stockroom.<eos> I did it because I was jealous.<eos> You're better at Spencer's Gifts than me.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> No, I don't want another gag gift.<eos> No, it's a real one.<eos> A stethoscope?<eos> For when you're a doctor.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> Look, I know I'm always really hard on you, but watching you at that job made me see that when you're passionate about something, you can do anything.
This has nothing to do with me at all.<eos> No, it's mostly you.<eos> So my dad set out to make Erica's life better.<eos> Hey, You.<eos> Or not.<eos> You're my son's friend, right?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> And you've been in love with Erica for a long time?<eos> Like, forever.<eos> She finally loves you back.
Let's say you didn't beat me up, and I became a Mr. Turd Smugglins.<eos> Would that appeal to you? No.<eos> Be in the quad at 3:00.<eos> While I was forced to face my nemesis,<eos> Erica was suddenly feeling bad for hers.<eos> Evy, hey.<eos> You... okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Something bad didn't happen to you, like a paper cut or a nasty break-up?
I know!<eos> Listen up.<eos> The next phase of our training begins tomorrow.<eos> You will power-wash the driveway, like a true Shinobi warrior.<eos> Um, I can't wait till tomorrow.<eos> I'd rather not wait, either, grasshopper, but I have to rent the power washer from the hardware store, It's a whole thing.<eos> No, I have the tournament tomorrow.<eos> The tournament... What?<eos> Tomorrow's the big day where Adam squares off against his same-name nemesis, his namesis.<eos> Wait a minute, are you telling me that someone's gonna put their hands on you for real-skis?
Also, Bevy, I need to borrow $8,300.<eos> More on that later.<eos> Let's focus on that leg.<eos> He's gonna use the ancient wisdom of the Orient to save me.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, I was just trying to think of a way for you to win this thing.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> Out of my way.<eos> Look, schmoo, all I ever wanted to do was protect you, but maybe this time, protecting you actually hurts you in the end.
Why?<eos> ! Just checking your reflexes.<eos> Patient lacks muscle response and also see highly agitated.<eos> Damn right I'm agitated!<eos> You just hit my knee with a hammer!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> What's happening? !<eos> Patient's throat seems red and inflamed, especially that dangly part in the back.<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> Damn it! Come back and get the remote I just threw at you!
Don't you say that! I support everything about you!<eos> Except this. This is insane. I know!<eos> This is hopeless!<eos> So if I got to choose between being a regular-aged doctor and being with Lainey, I choose her!<eos> Stop. What are you saying?<eos> If it's between saving millions with my doctoring or saving one with my loving, then I choose to let millions die.<eos> But I was looking forward to letting my friends ramble on about their boring sons, and when they asked me about you,<eos> I'd smugly say, "He's a doctor."<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But I was gonna get personalized license plates that say "Doc's Mom" and steal all your cream samples and bother you on family vacations when I find a weird bump!
Meanwhile, my sister and I were hoping to end our drama and find Lucky.<eos> I don't know what hurts worse...<eos> My shattered heart or my broken hand.<eos> Forget the fact your fingers look like mangled sausages.<eos> We need to find Lucky so we don't have to watch Dad cry-whisper over her ever again.<eos> Yeah, I don't think it was about the dog.<eos> - He was crying over you.<eos> - Don't you say that.<eos> It's true. You're his Lucky.<eos> You didn't think he cared about you leaving, but he, like, loves you so hard that he's...
Just forget it. Ruben!<eos> Someone throw a freakin' punch!<eos> Fight over me!<eos> Fight over your prom princess!<eos> No!<eos> That was so hot.<eos> It had been two days since Barry pulled the fire alarm in the name of love.<eos> So he did it again.<eos> Barry!<eos> I told you I'm not going to prom unless Erica does.
What have you got there?<eos> What are you hiding? Nothing, Just some light reading material a friend suggested.<eos> Is this "friend" the older seductress you're making time with? Let me guess...<eos> She's got you hooked on all those lusty Danielle Steel novels?<eos> No!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Why is there an impossibly adorable tuxedo in your closet?<eos> Okay, I was gonna tell you...<eos> Jackie's either taking you to prom or Monte Carlo for the weekend, and neither are acceptable.
Adam. No!<eos> It's bad enough that you always see me as a little child, but now Jackie does, too.<eos> I hope you're happy.<eos> Jedi Master Adam's done with you two!<eos> Marvin?<eos> (LAUGHING) Oh, hey! Ho! Bev!<eos> How's it going?<eos> I was just... (CLEARS THROAT) poppin' into the Wawa here to pick up some strawberry milk and...<eos> And get a box of California raisins.<eos> You gotta treat the body good if you want it to treat you good back. You know what I'm saying?
How do you know so much stuff about me?<eos> Your sister's my best friend.<eos> I've known you my whole life, and I can honestly say there's... no one like you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Turns out Erica was right...<eos> Our family would never be the same.<eos> - To my peanut.<eos> - To peanut!<eos> Not a person in that room knew what the future held, and, yeah, it was scary but that's the thing about growing up.<eos> You learn that the things that scare you most end up being the greatest memories.
You're Bow's brother, right?<eos> That means you're about to become the uncle to my mother.<eos> That makes total sense to me.<eos> Johan Johnson.<eos> Charlie Telphy.<eos> Always a pleasure to meet someone who gets the theory of soul transfer.<eos> Gets it?<eos> I live it. I've got the soul of Henry Fonda.<eos> It's why I like cardigans so much.<eos> I sensed that about you.
"Dancing for horses"...<eos> Yeah, I see where I could have phrased that a little more clearly.<eos> Hello, Donald.<eos> Please...<eos> Have a seat.<eos> A little birdie told us about a certain speech.<eos> Funny thing about speeches... You kind of need teeth to give them.<eos> "Chill the hell out."<eos> Oh. Listen, about the speech... I know that I called you my friend, which, you know, that...<eos> that may be a stretch, but I honestly do see you as a friend.
Can you watch the bumps?<eos> I'm trying to design my project perfectly to scale.<eos> Dad, can you turn on the radio?<eos> Dylan, stop.<eos> Let the man concentrate.<eos> He's out of his depth.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> How hard can this be?<eos> "I'm hungry."<eos> And the food Mom gets you is usually pretty nutritious, right?
Children, look at your parents.<eos> They're not always going to be there.<eos> Think about that.<eos> I didn't know it could be like this.<eos> This is the most zen drop-off I've ever seen. What's your secret?<eos> I don't really care if anyone's late.<eos> You tell your wife to take all the time she needs to recover.<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> We love you, Jimmy.<eos> Oh, love you, too, Mom whose name I know.
Ah, "feel important," the illusion of importance.<eos> So now you're patronizing me.<eos> Well, guess what... I patronized you first!<eos> How?<eos> I took it easy on you.<eos> That day you crushed, I took all the hard stuff out.<eos> You crushed a baby day.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I crushed a big-boy day.<eos> You know that little list I gave you?
Blabbermouth, seriously!<eos> Come on!<eos> How do I provide value to the family?<eos> You Chased away that possum.<eos> I do more than that.<eos> I must.<eos> I'm tired all the time.<eos> Question, how do I help around...<eos> He insisted on this.<eos> Hey, I said I'd help you.
I was a late bloomer, too.<eos> I'm going to look for pins on the floor.<eos> - Get me when it's over.<eos> - Relax.<eos> All we got to do after this is get Dylan from her sleepover, Dad from the barbershop, and go to JJ's sled hockey tournament.<eos> Why can't we do anything for me?<eos> I'm always just dragged around to everybody else's stuff.<eos> Oh, love.<eos> Well, just for you, tomorrow, let's go swimming.<eos> We're going swimming because a physical therapist told you that it would help with JJ's muscle tightness.
This is different.<eos> You're a big boy, and you made a decision... one that you knew would hurt her.<eos> How do I make it better?<eos> Ah. That's a big-boy question.<eos> You didn't think much about what she wanted before.<eos> Maybe start now.<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> Rich guys.<eos> Kenneth!<eos> JJ wants to talk to you.
Yeah, we're on.<eos> Ugh, I don't want to see that.<eos> Yeah, no, that's right.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> Hey, Ray, I know you're waiting to hear from your secret admirer.<eos> Maybe you should check your phone?<eos> I would, but I'm on a digital diet.<eos> Recent studies show that screen time before bed can affect...<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> She texted you.
Damn it!<eos> You'll be okay, right, Ray?<eos> There's plenty of fish in the sea.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Grabbing my fishing pole as we speak.<eos> Ha-ha. Goodbye, Fiona.<eos> It was me.<eos> What?<eos> Fiona isn't real.<eos> It was just a prank I was pulling on you.
T-H-W...<eos> thwarted a businessman."<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Did I forget to get you guys out of the van?<eos> Manager!<eos> God! Do you see what she does to me?<eos> Mom refused to leave a note, got me all whipped up until I broke half the stuff in this place because we can't make a normal grocery run to make a simple pan of paella, which is worth half my grade for some reason,<eos> - without everything going crazy!<eos> - We forgot the rice.<eos> All of this could have been avoided if you just believed me when I told you I didn't ding the car.
No! We are not having another child!<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's not what this is...<eos> - Stud. - Unh-unh!<eos> I know all your moves...<eos> drinks that taste like college, baby-making music sung by men with your hair.<eos> Yeah... All right, you got me!<eos> Dylan is broken!<eos> We need to make another person who will love me unconditionally.<eos> I love you unconditionally.
Yeah, well, not this teen.<eos> I told you I didn't want a party.<eos> Yeah, but it's great.<eos> You're having fun.<eos> Yeah, until you spent the whole time talking to Elle.<eos> Elle is not bothered by me.<eos> Are you, Elle?<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, all right, all right, all right.<eos> Thank you. Believe it or not, your mom is not some lame embarrassment.
You're the coolest mom in town.<eos> Well, darling, you're preaching to the choir.<eos> A great choir.<eos> I do sing very well.<eos> I had no idea you wanted me to yourself.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't want you worrying about what I want.<eos> Then there's always someone cutting me in line.<eos> JJ... I get that.<eos> And Ray... he's pretty hopeless, but God bless you for trying.
Don't!<eos> I'll sell you the shoes.<eos> Here. Take them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not sure what just happened, but I'm happy to return the favor.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> "Big day.<eos> Your big brother taught you to be bold, taught you to be kind to strangers." Yeah, you did.<eos> Mom and Dad aren't gonna believe this.<eos> "Then big brother taught you to shut the H-E"...
No, but the commute's good.<eos> Commute's okay.<eos> But the best part of my job is the moment when you introduce the child to its new service animal, and, in an instant, the child knows it's safe.<eos> Cool.<eos> How much do you make?<eos> Do you like the idea of helping cool brands connect to their audience?<eos> Let me answer your question with a question.<eos> How much do you make?<eos> So, how much do you make?<eos> I told you... I'm a volunteer for a charity.
Hey.<eos> "We need to talk."<eos> Come in. So, what's going on, man?<eos> What brings you here?
Hey.<eos> "We need to talk."<eos> Come in. So, what's going on, man?<eos> What brings you here?<eos> In fairness, I do that a lot less than when we started.<eos> Let's get you up there.
You just seemed tired.<eos> S-U-D... "Suddenly I have a lot more energy."<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Where to next, then?<eos> "L'Erotica"? I think not'ica.<eos> You want to go here with your mother?<eos> L-U-C... "Luckily, she's not here."<eos> Yo, Dylan!<eos> You texted something about an accident and asthma and a mean dog?<eos> Yeah, I wasn't sure what would get you here.
"Understand... you can't do everything for me."<eos> I do understand, JJ.<eos> "If you did, you'd leave me alone.<eos> Can you?"<eos> Good luck finding a wife who's as good a mom as I am.<eos> I manipulated you, Dad.<eos> It was wrong.<eos> So, would you wear anything under the robe?<eos> Forget the robe.<eos> I-I used you.
Right this way.<eos> Thank you, Tina.<eos> That's Tony.<eos> He is the worst guy.<eos> Let's see what we're dealing with.<eos> We'll just run around the block.<eos> Should I get some of that black stuff that sports people put under their eyes?<eos> Maybe once you're a sports person.<eos> ♪ Hey, let's throw down some apps.<eos> Jimmy, what looks good to you?
I'm the fastest runner in the family.<eos> I beat you, Dylan.<eos> I'm a sports person!<eos> It was amazing, Maya.<eos> The flatbreads flowed like wine.<eos> At a certain point, I was like, "Aah!<eos> Enough with the flatbreads!<eos> We still have entrées coming!<eos> And Dane, he laughed at that.<eos> Wow. I haven't seen you this giddy since someone mistook you for their state assemblyman.
The Carl's Jr., where you eat for free 'cause you got beaten up in the parking lot.<eos> I have juice in other places.<eos> No, y-y-you have no juice, darling.<eos> [Laughing] You're juiceless.<eos> Okay, I do have juice, and you could take a note or two from Dane on how to make a man feel good.<eos> Morning, Ray!<eos> Have a good sleep?<eos> Good. Want to go for a race?<eos> Ready, set, go.<eos> Is this because I beat you?
You're cleared for camp.<eos> All right.<eos> So, um, what you got going on this summer?<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> A random girl in a car just looked at me and smiled.<eos> That tells me my problem with girls isn't my looks.<eos> Wait.<eos> What's the one thing girls who reject me have in common?<eos> They know me.<eos> So you want to go after girls who don't know you.
All right.<eos> So, um, what you got going on this summer?<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> A random girl in a car just looked at me and smiled.<eos> That tells me my problem with girls isn't my looks.<eos> Wait.<eos> What's the one thing girls who reject me have in common?<eos> They know me.<eos> So you want to go after girls who don't know you.<eos> But once one gets to know you, she knows you, so, like, game over.
I came for me.<eos> I needed to see you.<eos> I needed to see this, and I needed to say goodbye.<eos> So, I'm sorry if you don't want me here, but I came for me.<eos> "I want you..." H-E... "here."<eos> And that is why I came, for you.<eos> This moment brought to you by Summer Kenneth.<eos> I asked for two minutes.<eos> Anyway, all of the girls at my school talk to each other.<eos> Why am I telling you how every girl I meet doesn't like me?
- I did.<eos> I listened to your problem, and then I, as a friend, help you to fix it.<eos> This is just gonna make things harder for me.<eos> I mean, God knows I don't like Sarah, but I definitely didn't want her to lose her job.<eos> I thought you said she didn't even need that job.<eos> Again, I was just venting.<eos> I'm not even positive that's true.<eos> So, venting is lying.<eos> And what about Nicole?<eos> She's gonna hear about this and think that I asked you to do it.
But we knew that when we signed up for this crazy little game called retail.<eos> I don't get why anybody would do that. Mm, ask her.<eos> She's right over there.<eos> You already stole my husband. Now you're trying to get me fired?<eos> Actually, it was me.<eos> - It was you?<eos> - Yes, it was me.<eos> You were right about "Milo and Otis." Very effective.<eos> She only did it because she thought she was helping me, but this isn't what I wanted.<eos> I don't want bad things for you.
I'm proud of you, Eddie.<eos> Really?<eos> So you're not mad that I lied?<eos> No, I'm not mad.<eos> So, you're saying sometimes it's good to lie?<eos> No. Don't make me mad again.<eos> You lied about us having a dishwasher.<eos> Isn't that hypocritical?<eos> Eddie, there is something called a "white lie."<eos> And that is a lie that protects you from all the things that make white people soft.
They said the infomercial will air sometime between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.<eos> Mom, will you pass the popcorn?<eos> You're hungry?<eos> I'm surprised you're not full of papaya.<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> Can't a boy have a hankering?<eos> I can't believe you're gonna be on TV, Emery.<eos> Thanks, Eddie.<eos> I'm glad somebody's happy about it.<eos> I told you, I wasn't trying to sabotage you.

Another ticket?<eos> What do you mean "another ticket"?<eos> Here you go.<eos> It tastes worst than the beer.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> I call it Lou Brew.<eos> It also gets out permanent marker and blood stains.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I've seen you drink alcohol before and this never happened to you.
And then, eventually, I developed a pre-game routine to fight it the best I could.<eos> My Flush Pack...<eos> Before I drink, I take these precautions and it lessens the side effects...<eos> PEPCID, inhaler, eye drops, TUMS.<eos> You have to do all this nonsense every time you drink?<eos> I don't write checks my body can't cash.<eos> Also, there's some cash in here.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me about the tickets?<eos> Well, because every little thing sets you off...
Road trips are supposed to be fun.<eos> If I knew it was gonna be like this, I would have just given you the $20 to buy the chair back in Orlando.<eos> You both feel this way?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I don't want to be a road grump.<eos> I want to have fun on this trip, too.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You're already mad about the parking tickets.<eos> What parking tickets?<eos> Jessica, they can track you down by your license plate.
That's horrible!<eos> Was the baby alive?<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Was it?<eos> No, she wouldn't.<eos> So, I, uh, took your advice and talked to Jessica.<eos> Yay!<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Totally backfired.<eos> She's furious that I spoke to you about our private problems.
I don't know where to look.<eos> Just look at the plant in the corner.<eos> I still haven't gotten that wedge from behind the credenza.<eos> I can't believe they criticize each other right in front of us.<eos> Me neither.<eos> And how about Carol-Joan telling us her husband doesn't believe in pandas?<eos> I get now why you were upset that I complained to Honey about you.<eos> I promise I won't do it again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And if something's bothering you, you can just tell me.
Michael Bolton just became a partner in the restaurant.<eos> If that's not the definition of "stable," I don't know what is.<eos> I've run the numbers, Louis.<eos> And the books don't lie.<eos> Between the high mortgage, higher bills, insurance, and taxes, we're barely scraping by.<eos> In fact, we are this close to becoming my worst nightmare... being homeless.<eos> _<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Saving money on dry cleaning and making my blazer smell like London.<eos> I know you're excited about private school, but I hope being around all those rich kids doesn't change you.
But you said you'd look into it right away.<eos> Yes, first thing, when the new semester starts.<eos> See that, Emery?<eos> First thing.<eos> Look.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Those who can't wear the blazer will always try to tear it off you.<eos> The truth is, these public school kids, they're worse than us... reeking of school lunches and two-in-one shampoos.<eos> The other day, I saw one getting on a bus in flip-flops and a towel.<eos> I'm sorry your brother dragged you into this nonsense.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> You always find a way to make things work out for you. You said so yourself.<eos> And you're a social guy.<eos> You got your mom's thing of actually liking people.<eos> No, but that's the problem. I'm too social.<eos> I needed to be more like you... a solid, strong, good provider.<eos> But I-I'll never be able to do that.<eos> I'm a freakin' mess. I'm done.<eos> You're 22. You're not done.<eos> Trust me, life is gonna kick you around a lot, so you might not want to tear off all your clothes and flop around on the floor every time you hit a setback.
Listen.<eos> She stopped.<eos> Well, not for long.<eos> We're about to hit that bump on Northaven. Ohh.<eos> Yeah, they must have paved it.<eos> They paved the bump.<eos> Come on.<eos> We just got that one to stop crying.<eos> It's just one minute, you're driving around with your kids, listening to Elmo sing "I Don't Want To Live On The Moon,"<eos> and the next minute, your doctor's telling you he can't find your ovaries.
Did you just say, "I'm sorry"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> You never say you're sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't make a big drama out of it.<eos> I'm not making a...<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm gonna work on that.<eos> You know, you think you need to role model for your kids, but the fact is whether you think you're modeling or not, they are watching you.
Kidding.<eos> Uh, anyhoo, do you guys have seminars, too?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> The job's pretty much the job.<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, uh, what do you have then?<eos> And feel free to go into detail.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> You were looking on the wrong side.<eos> I told you, the pain is on his left side.
My next move is going in the house.<eos> Good idea. Act normal.<eos> Oh, hey, you're home earlier than I expected.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - Oh, it went great.<eos> We had so much fun.<eos> Me and him... and his girlfriend!<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Why wouldn't Tyler tell you he had a girlfriend?
I just feel bad because I never end up going with him.<eos> He's always so nice.<eos> He was the first person to tell me he liked my hair after I cut it.<eos> Sean sounds like a great guy.<eos> Oh, super great.<eos> I just hope he's not hurt.<eos> He drove such a long way, and it was such a nice gesture.<eos> No, a nice gesture is if you drive an hour.<eos> I don't know what you call a gesture after five hours.<eos> Did I tell you it was five hours?
So tickled.<eos> Well, congrats again, proud lady.<eos> Hey, do we have anything to be proud of?<eos> No, not that I can think of.<eos> That's what I thought, but Nancy Donahue drove up while I was getting the mail and kept going on and on about how proud I should be, and I had no idea what she was talking about.<eos> Why didn't you just ask her?<eos> I couldn't. I had already told her I was so proud.<eos> I couldn't go back on it after I'd already agreed with her.<eos> I'd look stupid.<eos> You know, historically, looking stupid hasn't always been a deterrent for you.
What?<eos> Wait. Hold on.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> N-No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I was not supposed to tell you that. Hmm.<eos> Well, I know I always joked around about her liking me, but I never thought she really...<eos> Why do you think she came to our house for spring break instead of the Bahamas?<eos> Who in their right mind would do that?<eos> She didn't even spend time with me. She just laughed at all your stupid jokes and followed you around with her eyes.
What? !<eos> I'm not prepared! How am I gonna learn all that stuff in a week?<eos> You stopped driving me to Sunday school.<eos> You told me to watch 15 minutes of "Hour of Power" and let you sleep.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I got ahead of it.<eos> I already called Reverend TimTom.<eos> Now, he doesn't do privates, but we're in luck 'cause this week he's hosting the Wilderness Jesus Jam.<eos> You lost me at "wilderness."<eos> Okay, look, you know I would never break a confidence, but I'm gonna break my no-confidence-breaking rule just this once and confide in you 'cause I think our friend really needs our help.
Why aren't you more excited about this?<eos> You're acting like you've never heard this story before.<eos> You've never heard this story before.<eos> You're lying.<eos> It is very un-cool to lie and triply un-cool to do it at Wilderness Jesus Jam!<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> Your name is Blake Ferguson.<eos> You live in Orson Heights.<eos> Your parents are Charlie and Anna Ferguson.<eos> You were born October 15, 2001, at Orson County Hospital, but my mom stole your mom's room and my dad got distracted by a sports game on TV and they accidentally took you home!
- Mike.<eos> Axl, your sister has a head.<eos> - Yeah, she's got a head right now.<eos> - No, I have a head.<eos> - I agree she's got a head.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I have a head. So on Brick's confirmation day, the most important thing he confirmed was that he wanted to be with our family.<eos> God knows why.<eos> ♪ Well, that's our story about family ♪<eos> ♪ Sometimes it'll drive you up a tree ♪
You know how I hate that.<eos> You know, the way I see it, there's still something missing from that pool... you.<eos> I... would love to be in there, but I feel a poop coming on.<eos> Playing it safe.<eos> Stop!<eos> No, you stop.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why do you care so much about something that you ignore most of the time?<eos> Well, by that theory, what are you still doing with Mom?<eos> I love this suit on you.
Well, by that theory, what are you still doing with Mom?<eos> I love this suit on you.<eos> And it loves being on me.<eos> You needed a good suit.<eos> Now you have something to wear to interviews... maybe even on a date.<eos> I know people don't wear suits on dates anymore, but maybe if you go to a play or something.<eos> People still go to plays.<eos> I mean, I don't.<eos> Your dad's glued to the couch.<eos> But when girls see you in this suit, they are gonna be all over you.
That's hilarious.<eos> You're gonna be getting a paycheck.<eos> You need a new bank account with checks and registers...<eos> All right, all right, I got it.<eos> No! You don't got it!<eos> You have to keep up with how much money you have in your account, you need cash when you leave the house.<eos> These are the things that separate a true adult from a man-child.<eos> Wow. And I let you touch me and everything.<eos> Kids.<eos> No one tells you how they're gonna wreck your life.
We can't afford to go.<eos> Remember that month we paid our bills off on time and we had this two-week window where we just watched TV?<eos> That was our Europe.<eos> Maybe he should have the real thing.<eos> I'm not sending my son halfway around the world when he can't even figure out a way to take his socks off with his hands.<eos> I don't get you at all right now, Frankie.<eos> Look, it's hard for you to understand 'cause you're not a carefree person.<eos> It's not your fault. It's just the way you're made.<eos> You're a straight arrow.<eos> You know what my mom said when she first met you?
I don't care if you know how to spell your name or not.<eos> What the hell are you smirking at?<eos> "Underpants" popped into my head again.<eos> Grow up, Axl!<eos> Oh, I am all grown up, muchacho.<eos> I'm going to Europe, and you can't stop me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm packing my nunchucks for the trip.<eos> Aw, that's great. The boy genius is packing his nunchucks.<eos> No one is letting you on a plane with nunchucks.
I'm not gonna sue you, except maybe for extreme niceness.<eos> Ah. That's not a real thing, right?<eos> I know, logically, it isn't, but I am in a very delicate place right now.<eos> No, there's no damage to my car.<eos> I just had to come and meet you in person.<eos> Most people wouldn't have bothered to leave a note, much less 15.<eos> I just felt so bad.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You should feel good. These days, people are at each other's throats, mean to each other all the time.<eos> Clearly your parents raised you right.
- It's not just that. It's this land.<eos> It's ancient, powerful.<eos> It makes me feel things.<eos> What kind of things? Why don't you pull over?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> I've been meaning to ask you about that.<eos> Not much to tell.<eos> My...<eos> My grandma ran a scam on a guy, guy got mad.<eos> Is that guy gonna try and shoot you again?
Slippery slope and whatnot.<eos> Maybe you should twelvestep it over to a meeting.<eos> Doesn't exactly work that way.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just a lot of ladies wearing cocoa butter body spray.<eos> Maybe she's somewhere else.<eos> Like, um... The Boobie Trap?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> My brother told me.<eos> He followed you.
And if he sends anyone else, they'll die.<eos> And if I see you again, Ross... you'll die.<eos> - Understand? - Yeah.<eos> You're never gonna see me again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll give you a minute to get changed.<eos> I fetched top dollar in my day, too.<eos> Well, we have so much in common.<eos> And yet, all that pain gives you plenty to leech.<eos> I'm sorry for what they did to you. Don't be.
I've been summoned to the British embassy.<eos> Another debriefing about Willoughby?<eos> MI6 special-op director's in town on a fact-finding mission.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You good?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure? Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, um... any more on Kai Chen?<eos> Gibbs told you not to get involved.
What do you want to know?<eos> Where are the nuclear fuel rods?<eos> Buried.<eos> About 500 feet from where we hijacked the truck.<eos> I carefully selected the spot because it's near an auto salvage yard.<eos> We unloaded the barrels and the truck drove away.<eos> We tracked that truck halfway across the state.<eos> Figured you would.<eos> Okay, write it all down.<eos> And include how Deputy Director Roden at the Department of Energy tipped you off... both times.
I'm calling the cops.<eos> We are the cops.<eos> Try to keep up, kid. Hey, that's my wallet.<eos> Taj Robinson, D.C. address.<eos> Taj, this is an active crime scene.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Bro, I'm a Voltrane alarm technician.<eos> All right?<eos> I was called here to remove the unit.<eos> Who called you?
Gibbs.<eos> NCIS.<eos> Listen, the only reason you and I are still talking is because the bomb squad said that your little bomb was clock timers stuck in modeling clay.<eos> So you want to tell me what the hell's going on?<eos> Aristotle banana split.<eos> Hey, Abbs.<eos> Gibbs.<eos> NCIS.<eos> See, now those are the only two words that this woman has said that make any sense.<eos> So I called you here to explain.
I tried.<eos> But the wipe was ordered by Operations Director Knox Ellicott, but he's been dodging my calls.<eos> When did he order it?<eos> Last night.<eos> After the murder?<eos> Get him in here.<eos> I'm sorry about the missed calls.<eos> I've been in meetings all day, as you can imagine.<eos> Yeah, you had an excuse last night, too.<eos> The boss told you to stay home?
Get him out of there now.<eos> I volunteered for Willoughby.<eos> I know what I signed up for.<eos> Let me see this through to the end.<eos> NSA has a new recording from last night, same two callers.<eos> Get it to Qasim.<eos> Qasim, these conversations you've been listening to, they're about a terrorist we've been tracking for months.<eos> Bishop, get your mind off revenge.<eos> You need to stay out of it.<eos> If Gibbs finds out you're working on this, and I'm helping you, he'll kill us both.
Uh... you got my message.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All ten of them.<eos> I see you're taking it out<eos> - on the dust mites.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> We can't just let Chen get away.<eos> That's exactly what we've been ordered to do.<eos> Yeah, well, that congresswoman can take her pause button and shove it up her ass.<eos> Gibbs has just let you back in.
Oh. Speak of the devil. Oh.<eos> Yeah, Gibbs.<eos> McGee was just attacked by two armed assailants.<eos> He what?<eos> In his apartment.<eos> Is McGee all right?<eos> Agent McGee?<eos> Yes, I will do that, Leon.<eos> Just keeping you in the loop.<eos> Call you later.
How's retirement?<eos> Well, two years out of the Corps, I still keep my room inspection-ready.<eos> Civilian life is an adjustment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I know the feeling.<eos> My daughter wants me to get a new wardrobe, but... old habits.<eos> Laura still stationed out of Norfolk?<eos> No.<eos> No, she's, uh... she's been in Maryland these last few months.<eos> She's actually the reason I came to see you, Gunny.
Yeah, I know the feeling.<eos> My daughter wants me to get a new wardrobe, but... old habits.<eos> Laura still stationed out of Norfolk?<eos> No.<eos> No, she's, uh... she's been in Maryland these last few months.<eos> She's actually the reason I came to see you, Gunny.<eos> She in some sort of trouble?<eos> Laura's dying, Jethro.<eos> We... we need your help.<eos> My dad tracked you down?
Oh, yeah, that was it.<eos> Sounds like sour grapes.<eos> Nicole knows I was the best thing that ever happened to her.<eos> She also mentioned that you were the one that gave Petty Officer Collins a black eye.<eos> Hey, what's the matter?<eos> Can't stand a lot of competition?<eos> Oh, I don't think there's really any competition there.<eos> Collins was smarter... more successful, better liked by the crew.<eos> You think I give a damn?<eos> I think it drove you crazy.
I want you to have it.<eos> Me?<eos> Wouldn't you rather your dad?<eos> No.<eos> He's a marine.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I want you to have it for the same reason Sofia gave you that photo.<eos> It wasn't about giving you something to remember her by.<eos> It was her way of saying she'll remember you, too.
Thank you.<eos> But I do have a stipulation.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> No matter how little time the doctors say you have you keep fighting every day... for the next day.<eos> And the next, and the next.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a little stipulation of my own.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> When you look at that pin, I don't want it to remind you of some girl who died.<eos> I want it to remind you of someone you helped.
Hmm. I didn't notice.<eos> Yeah, Ellie's a deadeye.<eos> Glad she's on our side.<eos> - Ah, there she is.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Hey, Quinn, you missed a serious gunplay this morning. Oh.<eos> Really, though, where were you?<eos> Uh, at the corner of mind your own business. Oh. Okay.<eos> You won't believe what that was about.<eos> The admiral asked you to track down the computer hacker who infected his laptop with ransomware?
You ever heard the name Jack Haley?<eos> No.<eos> NBA journeyman.<eos> '96 Bulls.<eos> Rode the bench most of his career.<eos> But he was the one person that the team's star forward,<eos> Dennis Rodman, trusted the most, opened up to, often leaned on.<eos> What is your point, sir?<eos> Haley made the biggest impact of his career from a seat on the bench.<eos> And the only thing stopping you from doing the same is you.
Bishop?<eos> Checking his credit card and bank records to see if I can connect him to any large deposits.<eos> Quinn.<eos> I'm gonna check his cell phone records.<eos> Maybe I can place him in Boonsboro the day Corporal Campbell was killed.<eos> I'm gonna take another whack at the Justice Department.<eos> Torres, maybe you can check...<eos> Where is he?<eos> What up, Royce?<eos> Witness protection looks good on you.
Let her go.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I think this is a fitting end to our little story.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Jane.<eos> God.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Hold it, hold it.<eos> I told you I would destroy you, Wells.
We have to leave, now.<eos> What happened? We have to leave right now.<eos> I can't just leave.<eos> Look, Jane, please.<eos> John is here, and he intends to kill you.<eos> What?<eos> Are you bleeding? Look, this isn't my blood. It's yours.<eos> John murdered you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He killed you, and I've come back to save you.
My final voyage.<eos> I thought about getting you something, but... all I could hear was your voice in my head.<eos> Bringing back a gift could potentially change the course of history.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> I wouldn't mind a keepsake.<eos> Or a computer.<eos> So, that's what I got for you.<eos> I have nothing as amazing for you.<eos> You've given me so much more than you know.<eos> When I met you, I had no idea where my life was going.
Not even close. Give me a minute with her.<eos> Watch out.<eos> I'm Asa valdez.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Your mommy coming to pick you up after work?<eos> I know yours was doing life until she was shanked in the shower.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's tough being a crack whore.<eos> The kinzies took you in.<eos> They cleaned you up, gave you a home.
Why is that, Caitlin?<eos> You're Anna valdez.<eos> He said I could be just like you.<eos> I don't think you killed him, Caitlin, but I got to tell you, things are not looking good for you right now.<eos> Like I care.<eos> You care a lot.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Judge kinzie showed me the birthday card you gave him.<eos> You wrote, "thank you for saving my life."<eos> The kinzies were the best thing that ever happened to you.
I'm not gonna let him take my power away."<eos> So I started coming to these meetings.<eos> And I felt better right away.<eos> Damn.<eos> Gimme a minute.<eos> It was nice to know I wasn't the only one.<eos> Hey.<eos> - How you been?<eos> - Good.<eos> Didn't recognize you out of uniform.
So now you're attorney and judge.<eos> Dare to dream.<eos> So, what did the real Dr. Bansal do?<eos> Nothing. But he's testifying against my client, so I'm planning to invalidate his testimony by proving he lied under oath.<eos> And that is why you should never lie to your mommy.<eos> So, is your client guilty?<eos> It's not as simple as that.<eos> - Sure it is.<eos> - What I get, Roger, is that you're an LAPD cop who bleeds LAPD blue.<eos> And I love you for that.
Tell your future self to call me.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> This place hasn't changed a bit.<eos> Go figure.<eos> Alejandro Cruz?<eos> You just won me 50 bucks.<eos> I knew I'd see you again.
We can't do that without a name.<eos> Jeffrey Veld, same guy who approved the rangers' transport route.<eos> Look, Sheriff's is a good group, but there's always one bad apple.<eos> Everything all right here?<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> We just can't get enough of that rented-shoe smell.<eos> Smells like foot and ass.<eos> It's so nice.<eos> Roger Murtaugh, in the flesh.<eos> I recognize you from your picture on the wall.
All right.<eos> I'm-a give you three seconds to take that back and apologize.<eos> So start counting.<eos> One...<eos> Okay, here's the thing, if we're gonna get into a fight with police officers in a bowling alley... two... then there's one thing you've got to know.<eos> Hit first.<eos> Well, I am glad to hear that you are doing well over there, Avery.<eos> Today captain, tomorrow who knows, right?<eos> So far so good, and likewise.<eos> I'm glad things are good for you at Sheriff's.
What was that?<eos> A strand of Scarelli's hair that found its way to the victim's sweater.<eos> Second time around, the DNA sample was not compromised.<eos> And Scarelli went away for life.<eos> I framed a man for murder, Riggs.<eos> Come on.<eos> The guy was guilty, right?<eos> Justice served.<eos> So, what?<eos> This Reed cat's putting the screws to you?
Well... you got to tell him.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're a good cop.<eos> Don't forget that.<eos> Go get him, Riggs.<eos> Do it the right way.<eos> Hey, how'd it go in there, buddy?<eos> Did you tell them all how heroic I am, saving you and your partner's life?<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I told them.<eos> It didn't cross my mind to tell them that I think Davies paid you to break him out, and then you killed him when you thought we were too close.
You got an address?<eos> Okay, 4415 Moreno Drive.<eos> Last homeowner is a Peter Scarelli?<eos> You can kill me here, but it's just a matter of time...<eos> Shut up.<eos> I'm not killing you.<eos> Sins of the past.<eos> Let me introduce Peter Scarelli.<eos> Do you remember Captain Avery here?<eos> He's the man who framed you for murder.
Well, he's with his family, but... he's got a real Texas son of a bitch as a partner, so he's used to it.<eos> But I'll pass on your regards.<eos> You stay safe, Detective.<eos> You keep 'em honest out here, Riggs.<eos> So this is it?<eos> You resign, and Reed keeps his job at Sheriff's.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> He can prove my involvement, I can't prove his.<eos> Barton destroyed the recording.<eos> When this goes public, they're gonna charge you with a felony, and then every arrest that you made, including the 400 with me as your partner, is gonna be thrown out or subject to appeal.
"What creature walks on four legs in the morning, "two at noon and three in the evening?"<eos> It's like something out of a Christmas cracker rather than a Greek tragedy, isn't it?<eos> And it was Oedipus who gave the correct answer - man.<eos> He crawls as a baby, then walks on two legs, before needing a stick in his old age.<eos> A bit like you, Nigel.<eos> So... Do you prefer leg or breast? That's it, I'm calling the police.<eos> And tell them what exactly?<eos> That you're the victim of a student prank?<eos> In 25 minutes, you'll have a dead girl in your rooms in the middle of the night.<eos> You found out who she was, she threatened you, so you killed her.
hidden in plain view behind the circuit board of a Lite-Brite, the piece of paper that would change my mom's life forever.<eos> Dad, I stumbled upon something incredible hidden in Erica's room, and I need to tell someone, but I can't because she'll never forgive me.<eos> Okay, you twisted my arm, so here it is.<eos> I'm Erica's hero.<eos> Me, baby, me!<eos> Well, I'm glad this worked out for you.<eos> You know what this means, right?<eos> I have succeeded as a mother.<eos> Now, I know there were times when I quietly wondered if I had failed as a mother, but now I know the truth.<eos> Success! Did it ever occur to you that Erica hid that essay so you wouldn't overreact like you are right now?

No way.<eos> I'm your hero. No!<eos> Our history together will show<eos> I think you're the absolute worst. But now I'll forever know how you really feel about me, which is, "Everything my mother does comes from her heart."<eos> Stop using my words against me.<eos> You are not my hero.<eos> I read a document that says otherwise.<eos> God, you ruin everything!<eos> And yet I'm your "beacon on the hill."<eos> I resent you so much right now.
Bevy!<eos> Where's my tin of holiday popcorn? !<eos> Looking for something? Mmm!<eos> Flavored corn deliciousness.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - Looks like you're not the only one who can enjoy four types of gourmet popcorn whenever he wants.<eos> You better not have touched white cheddar.<eos> Oh, I touched the white cheddar but good.<eos> That quadrant was for dads only!<eos> Seriously, what's wrong with you?
If you need us, we'll be shoveling the walkway like we should have done in the first place.<eos> And with that, our dad was back to being our dad again.<eos> But that snow day, he realized there's much more to being a father, - than enforcing the rules.<eos> - Hey! You snow babies gonna fight back?<eos> ♪ Believe it or not ♪ So, yeah, our snow day didn't go as planned... but turns out, it really was the day - we'd always hoped for.<eos> - Take that, old man!<eos> ♪ Believe it or not, I'm walking on air ♪ Oh, good. The walkway's shoveled.<eos> Oh! You're gonna be one sorry Schmoo!<eos> And that night, even though it was freezing outside and we were lobbing balls of ice at each other, we played in the snow as a family for hours.<eos> ♪ Believe it or not, it's just me ♪ Because in the end, nothing keeps you warm like being around the people you love most.
Presumably you have to break the patient's other leg to actually get him in there.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then there's public transport.<eos> Now, OK, in the UK, this is a bus, yes?<eos> - Yeah. - Let me show you a photograph of a local bus here.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Wow!<eos> 155mph.<eos> Costs £7 million. Seats 23 people.<eos> You telephone the owner. He comes and picks you up and takes you to where you want to go.
Yeah, and you want to stop whole boatloads of people from finding safe haven, all because of what he did to one man eight years ago?<eos> You know, I want revenge for what happened.<eos> It's all I've ever wanted, but this just doesn't feel like revenge anymore.<eos> It just feels selfish.<eos> Your kids will be fine.<eos> They have a great man for a grandfather.<eos> And what about you?<eos> I'll see you soon, Pip.<eos> Hey.<eos> What happened to you last night?
Your recruits' identities are safe.<eos> We're both cleared to be here.<eos> We promise it won't interfere with your instruction.<eos> We're investigating the nearby death of a man last night.<eos> His remains were found in the aftermath of an explosion in an abandoned building.<eos> I'm happy to help.<eos> So, what does this have to do with me?<eos> The body is one of your former recruits.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Alex, she lied to you, kicked your ass, and left you for dead, and that's just today.

No.<eos> First I needed to sober up... remember what I'd done and pack my meager belongings.<eos> What you said last night...<eos> You were right.<eos> I didn't get what I wanted.<eos> But nobody does.<eos> I mean, you don't, right?<eos> No, we both have that in common.<eos> There is no justice for me. Just like there is no freedom for you.<eos> I'm sorry if... what I did... hurt you.
How's... How's your shoulder?<eos> They said I'll only ever really feel it in the cold.<eos> - How's your...<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know what else to ask you anyway.<eos> This whole thing, it's been so, um...<eos> You could have escaped.<eos> When those trucks blew, you were close to the perimeter. You didn't have stay.<eos> To save a bunch of people who didn't believe you, who didn't see what you had seen coming?
If I wanted to go to iceland, like, Tomorrow,<eos> Would you want to come?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Really?<eos> But you hate last minute plans.<eos> Yeah, I used to.<eos> But now I figure,<eos> As long as I have my laptop, I can work from anywhere.<eos> Chiyoko-san.<eos> Threw you around like a rag doll.
Yeah.<eos> Well, anyway, the point is,<eos> We both lost sight of how special this is.<eos> I'm gonna fight for her.<eos> Yeah. Put a little Ã¢Â€ÂœtryÃ¢Â€Â in that love triangle.<eos> This was such a good idea.<eos> Yeah. The site of our first date.<eos> Back to the scene of the crime.<eos> Crime is right. We had to use fake ids to get in.<eos> Yours was so bad, it didn't even look like you. He had a chinstrap.
- I don't get it.<eos> - I'm just the messenger, man.<eos> Oh, you are?<eos> Well, then tell her thanks for changing the security codes on me, and I want my goddamn tools from the warehouse.<eos> Tell her that.<eos> You know, Lena's been having nightmares.<eos> - Did she ask you to tell me that, too?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, then, I don't need a messenger, okay?<eos> Just do the job I'm asking you to do.
- Hey!<eos> - Sayonara, bitches.<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I like your shirt.<eos> I hope you like Mexican food.<eos> Did I mess up? No.<eos> I-I love Mexican.<eos> When I told you about my son.
- Sayonara, bitches.<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I like your shirt.<eos> I hope you like Mexican food.<eos> Did I mess up? No.<eos> I-I love Mexican.<eos> When I told you about my son.<eos> I hope that didn't scare you off.
Deran dumped it all in the toilet.<eos> Agent Orange is playing at The Cove.<eos> You know, I like Agent Orange, but... You know what?<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> So sine is the opposite side of a hypotenuse.<eos> It's just 4 over s...<eos> What?<eos> Um, you're just... you're being really nice.<eos> You didn't... you didn't have to help me.<eos> Don't want your dad hauling you off to Guam.
Later.<eos> Deran!<eos> Deran, could use some help.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - He's next.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What's up, Adrian?<eos> Bartending?<eos> No, I own the bar.<eos> Wow. How much did... Smurf give you to buy the place?
Oh No, no, do not come!<eos> What? What is the point with the painting?<eos> I do not know I would not say it's a long way forward!<eos> But is it so hard to make a copy?<eos> I'm sorry It's not about making copies. I'm sorry This is art.<eos> Yeah But you do not have to be a fool!<eos> It's okay It's simple to imitate One of no account, but ... It's okay Replicate someone of the kind It is really impossible.<eos> Oh Well, it's just that I have no choice.<eos> I do not know The Prado Museum can not leave the hall Still closed for a long time, without any motivation.<eos> I'm sorry Art is the impulse Which pushes you to create a work.
Well, then He welcomed her in the house as a child, with her mother And sisters, and in the end if she fell in love.<eos> It's okay - Let's say he likes girls.<eos> - How is it possible?<eos> I'm sorry It goes hand in hand With the lover publicly?<eos> I'm sorry A man who manages his marriage How can it govern a state?<eos> I do not know I'm going to give my greetings To the Duchess de Osuna.<eos> I'm sorry Look for the Duchess de Alba. - All right.<eos> - Are you convinced that I should do it myself?<eos> - Alonso ... The Duchess had a weakness For rude men.<eos> What? And I'm fine with you, Any wig puts you.
- What happens?<eos> I do not know We do not have two missions, but three.<eos> And now that you have it?<eos> I'm sorry Anything.<eos> You know The real ones want Who goes with them in the countryside.<eos> I'm sorry We leave tomorrow.<eos> I do not know It will only be for a few days ...<eos> You know And I will miss you a lot.<eos> It's okay I want you to come with me, darling ...<eos> What? But the queen is annoying Who brings you along with my wife.
I'm sorry Well, some more than others.<eos> That's all - But I've never beat anyone. - No need.<eos> I'm sorry It does not work.<eos> They are two actors. You approach, From one punch to one, he falls to the ground ... It's okay And María Teresa is alive And mad love for you.<eos> - Is that so easy?<eos> - Yup!<eos> I'm sorry In my opinion it is very dangerous ...<eos> It's okay - best to continue to send them chocolates.<eos> - It is the only solution.<eos> I'm sorry María Teresa has lost interest When Alonso humiliated you in public.
I do not know I just ask for a moment, please.<eos> I'm sorry What causes you to paint?<eos> The Beauty of the Naked Body?<eos> The nostalgia of youth?<eos> The fear of loneliness?<eos> Yeah They're just crazy.<eos> Bald and rough, you know?<eos> You know But what do you understand, she?<eos> It's okay You can only paint ... That's right A woman who is obsessed with you ...<eos> It's all right Who keeps you in the punch ... You know what? To his mercy.
Yeah They're just crazy.<eos> Bald and rough, you know?<eos> You know But what do you understand, she?<eos> It's okay You can only paint ... That's right A woman who is obsessed with you ...<eos> It's all right Who keeps you in the punch ... You know what? To his mercy.<eos> It is not enough to love her.<eos> He must have stolen the soul.<eos> I'm sorry And you must also have it The nobility to recognize it.<eos> It's okay Yes, because if it is lust and enough, The portrait will be a rape.<eos> And if there is only detachment, well ... I'm sorry What a difference there would be with a surgeon That puts you with a scalpel?
Yeah - Do you know who he was?<eos> - No.<eos> His eyes were emaciated.<eos> I do not know You can not cuddle In missions, Velázquez. No!<eos> Yeah - I had to talk to Goya.<eos> - What about Bolivar?<eos> - Please do not say anything.<eos> - Velázquez, please.<eos> Yeah - If he finds out Salvador, he kills me.<eos> - But what did he tell you?
Do you remember the tale of the formichina?<eos> What was he looking for a contender?<eos> She wanted to get married as soon as possible.<eos> I kept these books To read them to your children.<eos> The grandchildren are the joy of old age.<eos> But I'll give it to Nuria Vidal.<eos> Because she ... will soon be grandma.<eos> Mother, I am still very young.<eos> Between three years I finish my studies and I can think of marriage.<eos> But who will take you to 27 years?
So are those damned pills?<eos> And I do not know, huh?<eos> - Because it's my body and I decide.<eos> - Yes, but you are my woman!<eos> Look, Alonso,<eos> I love you so much, But I'm not nobody.<eos> And I do not want to have children.<eos> There are already enough children Without parents and neglected.<eos> I prefer to provide them before To give birth to a child in this world I like less and less.<eos> Think about what I told you.
Yeah, storage room.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> Tshirts and DVDs.<eos> Who watches DVDs anymore?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's heavy.<eos> You have an apostle spirit.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It means you're willing to serve Jesus no matter what's asked of you.
Anywhere but with you.<eos> So you're gonna leave Javi standing out there on the beach?<eos> I'll take my chances.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Not only are you on the run from Javi, now you're on the run from me.<eos> J, you wanna keep working with us, you can't miss a meeting.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, man.<eos> Where were you?<eos> My leg opened up.<eos> Did smurf take you to a hospital?
As a caterer.<eos> Our way in, man.<eos> For the yacht heist we were talking about.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> Used an alias, one of the ones we bought for the Indian casino thing last year.<eos> You're lookin' at Eric Miller, who starts his first shift on Saturday.<eos> Kick it a little bit? Hell, yeah, I do, man.<eos> All right.<eos> Longer we sit here, dumber we are.<eos> She's treating you like a punk.
Okay, did you call the cops?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> She's okay, j. She's okay.<eos> They... they just... they just left me on the road somewhere.<eos> I don't know where I am.<eos> Okay, tell me where you are, and we'll pick you up.
J?<eos> Hey.<eos> Who were those guys?<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> No, he just put a... He had a knife to my neck, but they didn't... They didn't do anything.<eos> I'm sorry, j.<eos> Okay.<eos> You feeling better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know we're never gonna let anything happen to you.
You think they're gonna come back?<eos> Nah, not tonight.<eos> Pope's been walking around with that shotgun.<eos> What, you think they would've killed smurf if she was here?<eos> That's why he's got the shotgun.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm gonna take the couch tonight.<eos> Smurf gave j my room.<eos> I'll sleep with Lena.<eos> So, look, did Javi say anything else to you?
Get the tools.<eos> Anybody want scrambled eggs?<eos> How was the couch?<eos> Okay? I'll see you in a couple hours.<eos> Could you take Nicky and j with you?<eos> Javi's not coming back.<eos> I know, but ii don't think they should be here alone.<eos> We leave in five.<eos> Come here.<eos> Ally said she'd take you to the beach.
- Baz? - Yeah?<eos> You know what I was thinking earlier?<eos> Do you remember when Pope was 13 and he decided that the cops had tapped all our phones lines, ripped every phone out of the wall?<eos> And then he ran out back and climbed up the telephone pole?<eos> He was gonna rip down those wires.<eos> If you hadn't talked him down, Pope would've been electrocuted.<eos> Is that why you took me in?<eos> To take care of Pope?<eos> No, Baz.<eos> I took you in because the minute I laid eyes on you, I fell in love with you.
Drunk dudes paying with expense accounts tend to be generous.<eos> So what about the weddings? You want 'em rich.<eos> But not too rich, because if they're too rich, they never had to work for it, tips are crap.<eos> How do you, uh, tell who's rich when you're choosing your shifts?<eos> Go online, search the date, the boat.<eos> You can figure out who the rich clients are. Smart girl.<eos> Well...<eos> So why can't these be traced?<eos> They're made of compressed copper powder and they just crumble on impact.<eos> I had to get rid of Javi, J, for you, because he broke into our home and hurt you.
But lately... man, I've been slipping.<eos> You know, the night of the robbery at the church, I scored.<eos> Went on the roof of my apartment and fixed.<eos> I talk to the cops, my PO will be there, I'll get tested.<eos> Piss hot, blow my parole.<eos> Okay, this is what you do.<eos> You tell them that you've been sick.<eos> You take 6 Sudafed PEs.<eos> They make you piss hot, too.<eos> Nothing connects you to the robbery, right? No.
It's good.<eos> You know, when the boat goes around Catalina, we'll have 20 minutes of no cell coverage.<eos> I mean, they're gonna have satellite phones on the bridge.<eos> We could get a Shoghi jammer.<eos> It'll kill those, take out the other cells.<eos> Yeah, Shoghi's aren't easy to get.<eos> Nah, I got a guy. My buddy Nick can hook us up.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll make the plan more solid when I pitch it to Baz and Pope.<eos> Does it bother you, how Baz and Smurf dealt with the whole Javi situation?
So it's cool, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Nicky, could you get us some beers from the refrigerator, please?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Andrew.<eos> How are ya?<eos> Pope?<eos> The super let us in.<eos> Right. "Pope."<eos> Your girlfriend at the church, Amy... she doesn't call you that though, does she?
I'll take care of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I had an idea who we can get to fence the jewelry.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nicky, man.<eos> Tell her she's out.<eos> I promised her.<eos> - Un-promise her then.<eos> - She'll be fine, man.<eos> And this is your way of getting Baz and Pope to take you seriously?
I...<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I saw the simulation... It's coming for us.<eos> I don't care what Tina Danza Fate says.<eos> Tyra DeNeil Fields is the most credible astrophysicist on the planet.<eos> We're not going to Houston; I'm going to Iceland to meet Evie.<eos> She thinks I blew her off.<eos> Now, give me the keys!<eos> And where are my pants?<eos> Uh, yeah, the tranqs that I gave you relax all the muscle groups, including the gallbladder ones, so... you pee-pee'd, but I hung them out of the window to air-dry.
Where's my Press Secretary?<eos> Where's my Chief of Staff?<eos> I want their asses in here...<eos> Calm down, sir.<eos> Please calm down.<eos> Don't you tell me to calm down!<eos> Get them here now!<eos> He's asleep.<eos> I can't wait for him to get better so that we can get the hell out of here and get back to D.C.<eos> There's something good waiting for you there?
I didn't have a choice.<eos> Is this where I hear the "I'm a poor black woman" speech again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is when this "poor black woman"<eos> slaps the hell out of you.<eos> Now apologize.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a bit on edge, too.<eos> I'm sorry. But you are very angry.<eos> I just told you why.
Where you been?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I seen you drive past.<eos> I had to go somewhere.<eos> And where you work again?<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - Excuse me? What are you?<eos> The neighborhood watch?<eos> No, but I'm trying to figure out who the hell you are.<eos> When I first met you, I said my name was Frankie.
That's a good point.<eos> You never called me back.<eos> She doesn't care, Annie.<eos> You know she doesn't.<eos> Yeah, she does.<eos> No.<eos> She constantly pushes me away.<eos> But it's over now.<eos> You know...<eos> When I saw you it felt like no time had passed at all.
- Can I say "whore" in here? - No.<eos> Lying, cheating hooker of a woman owes my client a boatload of damages.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Your mom just got served.<eos> Served?<eos> I haven't even ordered yet.<eos> Order!<eos> Uh, cheeseburger, please!<eos> Shh, shh, shh! Your Honor, this is clearly a ridiculous attempt at extortion.<eos> Yeah, and joke's on you, pal, 'cause we got nothing to extort. - Oh!
Come on!<eos> That did not work!<eos> He's such a douche.<eos> I know.<eos> Then why?<eos> I think it was the accent.<eos> What is it with you and ripping things?<eos> So I can do this.<eos> Oh, God. Stop.<eos> I told you I hate that.
On a boat?<eos> Rock bottom.<eos> 'Cause I don't have faith in anything, especially people.<eos> You see, people have this natural instinct to become part of a tribe, right?<eos> Commonly referred to as family or friends, but... it's still just a tribe.<eos> But not me.<eos> You're looking at my tribe.<eos> Me. Alone.<eos> You know why?<eos> I don't know, 'cause your parents didn't want you, and now you don't want anyone either?
No.<eos> But what I am sorry for is... Hurting someone like you, hurting a family like yours.<eos> Hey, got your text. I can take it from here.<eos> I know it's crazy, but part of me wanted to keep going, live the lie because I never felt so safe, you know?<eos> I never had someone like you look out for me.<eos> And I didn't want that to end.<eos> So I walked away from tawnya.<eos> You did what?<eos> I didn't take a dime of your money.<eos> The last time I saw you, outside the police station, I told tawnya I was out.
Your third stroke?<eos> Organ failure?<eos> An Aneurysm?<eos> You're... you're not taking care of yourself, and that... that scares me to death.<eos> And... and... What you're doing... It hurts me.<eos> And if that doesn't mean anything to you, then... By all means, do whatever you want.<eos> I'm gonna be okay.<eos> Just need a little time, little space.<eos> Then I'll be okay.<eos> And stop taking it out on your plants. What did they do to you?
Y-you put a whole schedule together - to make sure we weren't here at once?<eos> - It's for your own protection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - [Laughs] - See what I mean?<eos> So, let's all agree right now that this and that can never happen again.<eos> So, did you have fun vetting Adrian last night?<eos> Villa, that's not what last night was about.<eos> Oh, Rosie, come on.<eos> I think we both know why you're keeping an eye on Adrian.<eos> I mean, Tawnya lied to you about... well, basically everything, so now you want to make sure what happened to you doesn't happen to me.
Hey, hey. EMPD!<eos> Stop!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> You didn't think you were gonna get away that easy, did you?<eos> Good luck getting out of those, magic man.<eos> Oh, you think you're slick?<eos> I got your pigeon down the hall testifying against you.

That's what she deserves.<eos> Yeah, I think you're right.<eos> Can I help you, Janet?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Yeah, it's just...so out the blue.<eos> Yeah, I know, I apologise for that, but circumstances got out of my control.<eos> And I can't change your mind?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> But you know, you've got Greg.<eos> He'll help you through it.

I know Hetty sent you here to check up on me.
And yours.<eos> Any chance of showing me some mercy and getting rid of these?<eos> I don't think I'm going anywhere fast in my current condition.<eos> Yeah, I can absolutely help you out.<eos> As long as you help us out.<eos> We know you were working with Natalie.<eos> We know Natalie was working with Carl Brown.<eos> We also know that you're taking orders from someone.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> 'Cause that someone told you to pin the attack on Granger.
Wink. xx"<eos> Now, how do I heal a sick person so that my mum will let me move back home without God on my side?<eos> Because I really don't think he's on my side with this.<eos> It's very hard to heal someone without, you know...<eos> - Spiritual powers?<eos> - The NHS. - Done.<eos> - Hey, yas, yas!<eos> Ola, hey!<eos> Give it to them, give it to them, give it to them!<eos> Ola, my mum doesn't know you very well, does she?
I'm, I'm not...<eos> Look,<eos> I'm in a bit of a situation at the moment.<eos> Well, let me in, I'll help.<eos> I'm embarrassed.<eos> Babe, there ain't no such thing as embarrassing with us.<eos> Well, you and me haven't been us in a while.<eos> It's not the same, is it?<eos> Right, five more, I just...<eos> I wanted to find you to tell you that he don't deserve you, anyway.

Oh, no, enough of the fucking politics.<eos> Here, download it, let's do it.<eos> Esther's is right.<eos> Esther's is always right, Mandy.<eos> Nan, your phone's like from caveman times.<eos> Oi, Nan, I have already improved it.<eos> Dog owners, maybe they need baby-sitters to look after their dogs because they got rich people things to do and no real friends to help them.<eos> And I am going to do it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Trace, no-one's going to trust you with a dog.

Cleveland, I think you're lovely.<eos> And you deserve the world. Which is probably more than what the world decides to give you.<eos> That's the bath... that's the...<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> Are you feeling better?<eos> Can we discuss this when I've finished?<eos> CYNTHIA: Shall we go to Cheesy Eaters?<eos> Why the fuck didn't you say something?<eos> People judge you... especially women.
"What are you doing on the kerb?<eos> Shouldn't you be in college?"<eos> "I was waiting for you to drive me to your house to play with all my tight holes."<eos> But why are you just waiting on the kerb and how did you know that he'd be there?<eos> "I've even got a daughter that looks like you."
- Why 12:24?<eos> - Because...<eos> I don't know, I'm not sure.<eos> Just go to bed.<eos> I didn't even need to kick him out.<eos> Aaron. What's the time?<eos> 12:24.<eos> She knows I'm not ain't going to say nothing, she's my best mate.<eos> Oh, son! I'm sorry, yeah?<eos> Treating you like the shit off me shoe, you're my son!
- Tracey, my fucking hair's gone!<eos> It's just hair.<eos> Cand?<eos> Just hair.<eos> And now all this is, I got you, and you got me.<eos> That's what's beautiful, innit?<eos> Right, come on.<eos> Candice, you really have to start folding your clothes.<eos> Really. Really.<eos> All right, come on, Karly... what's your mother instinct saying to you?
They helped.<eos> -Let's go get the rest of the paladins.<eos> [Shiro] Thanks for saving me.<eos> You'd have done the same for me.<eos> How's your wound?<eos> My wound's great.<eos> It's getting bigger all the time.<eos> Just trying to lighten the mood.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> When Allura and Coran find us, they'll fix you right up.
[Shiro groaning] [grunts] Wake up!<eos> Zarkon has located the Blue Lion of Voltron on your planet, Earth.<eos> You must get it before he does.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I've planted a bomb to cover your escape.<eos> Get to a pod, now.<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -I am Ulaz.<eos> Now, come on!<eos> Zarkon will know that I released you, so I must disappear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Let's talk about it before the meeting tomorrow.<eos> I got to go.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Marjorie.<eos> - You called her?<eos> - She called me.<eos> Why would she call you?
She's having some problems with Victor.<eos> Oh, God. What?<eos> As it turns out, he has some sexual needs that are causing her to reevaluate some... long-held beliefs.<eos> Okay. Heard enough. Yeah.<eos> I suggested some breathing exercises that might relax her.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Oh, I also told her she needed a safe word.<eos> Good night, Mom.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Marjorie doesn't call you about sex.
Good night, Mom.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Marjorie doesn't call you about sex.<eos> You guys are throwing me a surprise party, aren't you?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Come on, my birthday's on Saturday.<eos> You and the girls have been whispering around me the past few days.<eos> Well, if you must know, we've been whispering about your haircut.<eos> We were gonna loop you in once it grew out.
Francis Drake, I trust you have good news.<eos> We sunk two warships.<eos> King Philip has always desired England. And now he has grounds for war.<eos> Have you taken any lovers with syphilis?<eos> I've seen men with that.<eos> Thethe... the lesions all over their body, thethe madness.<eos> You need to see a doctor immediately.<eos> In a state of emergency, a privy council can be installed by a royal signature.<eos> You are still king.<eos> You can assemble a privy council that supports you.
I...<eos> I can't think because of the noise.<eos> The child needs to rest.<eos> He can't catch a wink.<eos> Lay him down, nice and soft.<eos> Give him some peace.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Poor, poor thing.<eos> Claude, this isn't your fault.<eos> Luc is gone, you are here, which means he abandoned you.
Kill my husband, Lord Bothwell.<eos> I thought I would find you here.<eos> - You always loved those summers you spent here with your cousins.<eos> Is, Kiera here as well?<eos> She's right... here...<eos> I don't always see her.<eos> But when I do, she's as real to me as you are.<eos> I'm not well, am I, Mother?<eos> You've been under a strain, and that is all the more reason that you should stay here.<eos> At least until the privy council names you. - Steward of the Heir.
You were living in the marais?<eos> We hid in our apartments during the round-ups, But the germans found us a few days later. How?<eos> Our neighbours.<eos> People we used to have dinner with.<eos> As they took us away, I asked him, "why?" you know what he said?<eos> "Because you are a jew."<eos> I want to ensure. We have a smooth trip, and this will only happen.<eos> If we all behave. Is that clear?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Who put you in charge?
Thank you. Ma'am.<eos> There's one thing I've been meaning to tell you, and I promise you it's the truth. When you say that,<eos> I know you're about to lie to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Do you know how exhausting it is. To be lied to all the time?<eos> It goes both ways.<eos> I've spent days where it felt. Like I never spoke a single true word.<eos> By the end of those days, I feel like there's nothing left of me.<eos> I was ready to hate you. For so many reasons,<eos> But then I met you, and I couldn't.
Pat, you're allergic to Megan and you need to break up her!<eos> Are you actually suggesting that Megan is responsible for my hives?<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> You have stress urticaria.<eos> Megan is bad for you.<eos> Look at your face.<eos> Ken, I know you and the others don't care for her, but to suggest she is responsible for my condition is medically irresponsible and personally offensive.<eos> You're fired as my doctor.<eos> I don't know why you begged me to let you examine me.<eos> I was the one who told you to go to Tuttle in the first place!
One of my exes even suffered from panic attacks.<eos> Oh, and always felt an overwhelming sense of doom around me, but I didn't hear him complaining.<eos> Was that 'cause he was dead?<eos> I'm on the phone, Megan.<eos> I think this is best for both of us.<eos> I'm sorry, Megan.<eos> You know what, Pat?<eos> I don't care what you say. This relationship is over.<eos> Don't do that!<eos> He broke up with you!
- The silver one?<eos> Yes, I couldn't find it anywhere.<eos> Well, I sold it at the garage sale.<eos> - You sold it?<eos> - You said we should get rid of anything we hadn't used in over a year, and it'd been way longer than that.<eos> Yes, but that was a keepsake.<eos> Then you should have told me to keep it.<eos> I shouldn't have to tell you everything that's important.<eos> Except now you're blaming me for doing exactly what you said.<eos> - Whether I'm blaming you or...
- So, you broke that pledge.<eos> - I guess I did.<eos> - And, you said you'd never get married again, either.<eos> - I meant that.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Can I get a refund for these leftover chocolates?<eos> - They don't work.<eos> - One second.<eos> Abigail. Stephanie wants to talk to you about a return.
Stephanie needs to talk.<eos> What seems to be the problem?<eos> - It's these chocolates. - They don't work anymore.<eos> I gave a box to that health inspector when he came back this morning, but he just started handing out violations like he did the first time he came around, and telling me everything I was doing was wrong.<eos> He seems very unreasonable.<eos> Yeah, like more than anyone I've ever met.<eos> Look, I know how to run a business<eos> I mean, I started two of them. And if anyone knows how to follow the rules, it's me.<eos> But it just, it seems like he doesn't even care, and if he gives me a bad rating, well...<eos> Listen. No matter what anybody throws at you, you can stand up against them.
- I probably did say that.<eos> Here you go!<eos> If you're not feeling your best, you can come back here anytime.<eos> Can I help you find something?<eos> Here.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> I found these paintbrushes in Italy.<eos> They were being sold by an artist who barely said a word to me.<eos> He just let his art do the talking.<eos> You can keep that one and just pay me if you think it inspires you to create.
I don't think we've ever had an artist working here before.<eos> Is there going to be enough room?<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> - I brought you some breakfast.<eos> Ah, this place looks perfect!<eos> We want our guest to be comfortable in case he wants - to produce a masterpiece.<eos> - What are you going to work on?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I never really know until it's finished.<eos> Well, I set you up right here for a reason.
Very good!<eos> Good. Thanks.<eos> Thanks for helping me get ready for next week's competition, Grace.<eos> Well, I need to review my constitutional amendments anyway.<eos> I hope they don't change it again while we're studying. Yeah!<eos> You want to quiz me?<eos> Sure.<eos> I should pick through the hardest ones.<eos> I just feel like I really need to know this stuff now that Mr. Decarlo made me captain.<eos> And hopefully nobody on the team lets you down.
And that's a doctor, just standing there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Tough time getting out of bed this morning? - Yeah.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> I could tell you were tired when you walked in.<eos> But I have just the thing.<eos> Dried reishi mushrooms.<eos> You can eat them on their own, or they make a really good soup.<eos> It'll boost your immune system and get your energy back up.<eos> And there'll be a lot more food that's good for you at this weekend's Healthfest.
Have you enjoyed your time here at Grey House?<eos> - I've started to, yeah. - I mean, at first I didn't like that you set me up here, in what seems to be the busiest room in the house.<eos> I thought you might like to see some familiar faces.<eos> Faces, I don't mind. It's the people that are the problem.<eos> They're just so unpredictable.<eos> - I don't understand them at all.<eos> - From what I've seen you understand them better than anyone I know.<eos> All I do is paint.<eos> Well, you painted Sam and me together - before you even knew we were.<eos> - He looked at you a certain way when he came into your shop.
That's pretty soon to get the word out.<eos> - Oh, I can get the word out.<eos> - What movie did you wanna see?<eos> Superman. The one with Christopher Reeve.<eos> Yeah, I could get that delivered here by then, sure.<eos> Great, and I'll make sure enough people are here - to see it. - Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Hey. - Oh.<eos> That looks nice on you.
No, I guess not.<eos> - Great.<eos> So. Superman on the big screen.<eos> - That's pretty cool, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can't believe they decided to play it right after I was talking about wanting to see it.<eos> Yeah, it's funny how things work out sometimes.<eos> I like your hat.<eos> Thanks, yeah, it was my grandpa's.<eos> Did Nick ever tell you that he and I used to play on a team?
Sort of like browsing my store, except with greasy metal things.<eos> Yeah. It is kind of like that.<eos> Now you have something to wrap your hands around, like you wanted.<eos> I love it. Thank you.<eos> - Should we head inside?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You know, I actually wouldn't have minded<eos> - if you had thrown me a party.<eos> - I thought you didn't want one.<eos> It's the act of being surprised I don't like... people jumping out and screaming, "Surprise!" at you.
- But you guys are together all the time!<eos> - Are we?<eos> I mean, it seems like it...<eos> Well, I mean, can you blame me?<eos> - Okay, we'll see you later.<eos> - Bye. Have fun.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, I was just about to come looking for you.<eos> I was organizing some jewelry in my shop and I found these.<eos> Thought they'd look good on you.
Thanks.<eos> Excuse me, is this where the really good doctors hang out?<eos> - Joanne?<eos> - Look who's here!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, I don't know, I just happened to find myself on this part of the globe and decided to look you up.<eos> - Eve, this is my sister...<eos> - Joanne.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Is my brother treating you Okay?
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Is my brother treating you Okay?<eos> You could probably use a raise.<eos> You know, she should probably get a raise.<eos> - I like your sister a lot.<eos> - How is Nick?<eos> - Taller than last you saw him.<eos> - Wait, he's not twelve anymore.<eos> No. He's going to love seeing you.<eos> Okay, this is all a little bit different than the last time I saw you in New York.
That's not something she's just going to forget about.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that.<eos> I learned to love the people who came into my life and took care of me.<eos> I suspect that Pavla will, too.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Oh, Abigail?<eos> I'm getting a delivery of new guest towels tomorrow.<eos> If I'm not around, would you mind putting them in the armoire in the guest room at the end of the hall?<eos> 'Cause I'm running this place now?<eos> Because I'm asking you to do a favor.
I'll just be a minute.<eos> Your new parents seem really nice.<eos> My other parents were really nice, too.<eos> But they went away one day and never came back.<eos> That kind of happened with my dad, too.<eos> Did he die?<eos> He just... never came back.<eos> I'm sorry you got so sad.<eos> I'm sorry you did, too.<eos> These earrings I lent you look really good on you.
Cassie, Pavla's here.<eos> Can you let her parents know she's Okay?<eos> I can go look for them if...<eos> You did.<eos> Okay, I'll keep her here.<eos> - These are pretty.<eos> - Do you want to take one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You want to hop up?<eos> You know... Your mommy and daddy are probably looking for you.
Right here.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Hey, what you got behind this door right here?<eos> A maintenance room...<eos> It's where Reuben keeps supplies for the grounds, for the soup kitchen.<eos> The soup guy who had the little tiny crackers?<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Marty.<eos> I heard I might find you here.
Come on.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> I'd rather go with God.<eos> That's not really a good option.<eos> You know.<eos> Look. I mean, I know it's majestic, and the white dove, and everything, but...<eos> Hey, hey, hey, no!<eos> Hey!<eos> I got you.<eos> I'm gonna pull you up.
- I can't believe you hit me!<eos> - Well...<eos> So, I read your report.<eos> - Have some questions.<eos> - You shouldn't.<eos> Everything's in there.<eos> The shiner.<eos> Walk me through that.<eos> You're on the roof with the suspect.<eos> When did he punch you?
Thank you.<eos> Everything all right, DS Coles?<eos> Doesn't it make you lose heart, sir?<eos> When you know something, but you can't prove it.<eos> I see policing as a matter of judgment, not heart.<eos> Of balancing realities.<eos> I look forward to seeing you, Rachel.<eos> You brighten up the place.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> DCI Gently has always paid attention to you, hasn't he?
I'm telling you I did it!<eos> I'm telling you it was me.<eos> No, Robert.<eos> Robert, I need to tell them.<eos> - No, no, no, don't...<eos> - It's OK.<eos> - You can't, you can't.<eos> I want to do this.<eos> Because you're right.<eos> Nobody knows what that kind of secret does to you.
Oh, my God!<eos> My watch stopped, all the clocks in the house are wrong, and I don't know where my phone is.<eos> Oh my G... How did that get there?<eos> I'm already an hour late for wrestling practice. Oh!<eos> Guys, don't forget, my big match is tonight.<eos> I lose, but you won't see it coming.<eos> Hey, honey, I just came by to stop you.<eos> I mean, get you... um, talk to you.<eos> No time, Ma. I've got to get to the ring.<eos> Oh! Well, then, it's a good thing I caught you, then, because I just discovered that you can't wrestle, because it's against your contract with the Rangers.
I'm going home.<eos> - Okay, I'll buy you dinner.<eos> - Lobster? - Pizza.<eos> - Steak?<eos> - Pizza.<eos> - Done.<eos> Aah, I was hopin' for the pizza man.<eos> I wanted to tell you, Anita just stopped by, and she didn't even stay the full 20 minutes.<eos> Not really somethin' to brag about.<eos> Ben, I'm sorry, but this girl is playing you perfectly.
Sweetie, honey, I am begging you, don't do this.<eos> You could get hurt.<eos> You could end your career.<eos> Don't worry, Mom.<eos> It's all fake.<eos> That hurt more than I thought it would.<eos> That's because Ryan is trying to destroy your career.<eos> He blames you for not making the team.<eos> Uh! Why?<eos> Because your mother, who loves you very much...
Thinkin' she's so smart.<eos> Like I'm gonna go over there and make a scene or somethin'.<eos> I really don't think she even knows you're here.<eos> Oh, she knows.<eos> She's been makin' me dance, but it's time this puppet cut the strings.<eos> That really hurts!<eos> Just tryin' to make it look real.<eos> Hey, you gotta believe me, I had no idea she sabotaged your chances of becoming a Ranger.<eos> - What are you talkin' about?<eos> - That woman who seduced you the last night at camp, she did it on purpose.
The Dome of the Rock where the Prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven.<eos> Peace be upon him.<eos> That's what you say when the prophet's name is mentioned.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Mayfield.<eos> You are officially not a Muslim. That didn't take long.<eos> Much shorter than it took to prove that Reverend Finch didn't understand the first thing about the Book of Revelation.<eos> You watch what you say now.<eos> The reverend was a brilliant man.<eos> He really wasn't.<eos> In just two hours, he was questioning everything he'd told you.
So, just to be clear, we're not actually trying to invest in Togo's phosphate industry.<eos> We just want to make China think we are, so they do.<eos> But President Fabre's price for letting them beat us out is to force China to agree to benchmarks for sustainability as well as female education and employment.<eos> Which could tie them to similar benchmarks in the future.<eos> It's a big win.<eos> Not just for us, but for Africa as well.<eos> So we got China to spend the money we don't have in the way we wanted. Even if it looks like we got...<eos> - Pantsed.<eos> - Again.<eos> Which the press is gonna grill you about, again. - Yep.
If they know they're not alone, they may feel freer to speak.<eos> Plenty of religious, socially conservative countries still manage to turn a blind eye towards the sexual indiscretions of powerful men.<eos> Sexual assault isn't an indiscretion, Russell.<eos> It's a crime.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> I think it's worth a try.<eos> You don't know how glad I am to see you.<eos> Well, it's nice to see you, too.<eos> Wiseass, the camera stopped working when they dunked you.
Well, she cried at first.<eos> Said it was all her fault he was even down there.<eos> But later she kept asking when Spencer would be home.<eos> Well, maybe it's a blessing she can forget.<eos> What's our next step?<eos> Well, getting the kid home on bail pending trial.<eos> Ok. That's a good baby step.<eos> I can focus on that.<eos> And I'm ready, willing, and able to post that bail no matter how high they set it.<eos> I love you so hard.
And I'm not in the business of second-guessing good offers.<eos> Which this is.<eos> But I'm also not the one who will be doing time.<eos> What would you do in my shoes?<eos> I'm not in your shoes.<eos> It's a decision only you can make.<eos> Whatever you decide, I'm always in your corner.<eos> We all are.<eos> Spencer, if you want to fight this to the end, I promise you I will bring everything in my arsenal to the battle.<eos> But what I can't promise you is a better outcome than the one they're offering you today.
Previously on Reign...<eos> Does the archduke know about us? I told the archduke I would never give you up.<eos> Gideon!<eos> He was poisoned, Jane.<eos> Your Majesty, we have to go.<eos> I will find who did this to you.
I've called James back to court.<eos> You've lifted your brother's banishment?<eos> I haven't heard back from him yet, but I've told him how urgent my situation here is.<eos> I'm still operating without a full privy council.<eos> You want James to fill one of the seats? No.<eos> I want to name him regent.<eos> Just in case something happens to me during childbirth,<eos> I want someone trustworthy to step in to lead.<eos> You're going to be fine, Mary.<eos> And James will come as soon as he can. He's loyal to you.
Far away from the power that you should be seizing right now.<eos> I have no power left.<eos> Listen to me, Mary is in labor.<eos> A very difficult labor. Do you know what that means?<eos> My God, I'm going to have a child.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> Mary may not survive the delivery.<eos> In a state of emergency, a privy council can be installed by a royal signature.<eos> You are still king.<eos> You can assemble a privy council that supports you.
I want you all to save my baby. Do you hear me?<eos> I'm ordering all of you!<eos> No matter what it takes. Save my baby!<eos> Stay back!<eos> If you come anywhere near her with those, I will kill you myself.<eos> She's dying, Lord Bothwell.<eos> The queen wants me to save her child.<eos> Greer...<eos> Greer, I love you.<eos> I love you too.
You don't look well.<eos> Claude, where have you been?<eos> Charles has thrown your sister in the dungeon.<eos> My dear, what's wrong? Leith is getting married.<eos> I wrote to him, saying that my marriage to Luc is over, that I was willing to give up everything to finally be with him.<eos> Darling, I'm sorry.<eos> I tried so hard to honor my promise to Leith, to be a good person, but it just wasn't enough.<eos> Keeping your promise because you want to be good and honorable, isn't the same as keeping your promise because you truly love someone.<eos> Maybe you don't love Leith quite as much as you think.<eos> You have a husband who values you, so you still have a chance at happiness.
That witch is harassing me.<eos> You poor dear, you're surrounded by all of these godless devils, who no doubt wish you were dead.<eos> You have to get me out of here.<eos> I'm the queen of Spain.<eos> Yes, but you're in France now, and you conspired against the French king.<eos> You have overplayed your hand, and you will suffer the consequences.<eos> Those are Charles's words, they're not mine.<eos> I'll write a letter to Philip.<eos> I'm afraid that Philip, he's a little bit busy at the moment planning an attack on England.<eos> I intercepted this message sent by your beloved husband, in which he informs you that, due to a little naval skirmish with the English, those ships are needed elsewhere.
Mommy, please.<eos> Get me out of here and I'll do whatever you ask, I swear it.<eos> I can get you out of France, but it's gonna cost you and Spain a very long list of favors.<eos> The physician says you'll be back on your feet soon.<eos> It hardly matters.<eos> I can feel my power in Scotland waning, along with my allies.<eos> I still have a few loyal men on the privy council, but the rest belong to the Lennoxes.<eos> They will vote to take my son and make Darnley his steward.<eos> You will figure a way out of this. You always do.<eos> And now you have your child to inspire you.
Does the archduke know about us?<eos> - No. - Are you sure?<eos> Because I won't let my feelings for you put your realm in danger.<eos> You need this marriage.<eos> I admit that if I kept you chained to my side, the archduke might suspect something.<eos> I noticed you were careful to leave the door open.<eos> To avoid gossip.<eos> I'm protecting us.<eos> Come to my chambers tonight.<eos> There, the door will be closed, and I promise to thank you properly for your journeys for the Crown.
Well, Elizabeth may be shocked.<eos> Or would be, if you made it past her guards.<eos> Oh, she dismisses her guards right after her maids.<eos> But I shouldn't be telling you that, should I?<eos> Except she has told me what a trusted servant you are.<eos> She even pleaded with me to let you stay after she'd sent you all over Christendom, because I was jealous.<eos> Baseless, of course.<eos> She made sure I knew I was the only man she wanted.<eos> And Elizabeth can be very reassuring.<eos> I waited for you.
You assured me that this union was merely for political reasons, for your safety.<eos> You said it was for my survival.<eos> You told me yourself this marriage was a necessity.<eos> But you are sleeping with him in advance of it; a risk in and of itself.<eos> To make him think I love him and not you!<eos> To protect us!<eos> You lie to him, you lie to me...<eos> Because if you knew he suspected, you would end things with me.<eos> And I can't bear to lose you.<eos> Our affair puts you in danger.
Mary. Your husband is a threat to you.<eos> What do you want me to do about him?<eos> I'm the King of Scotland!<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Nicole, I've been thinking...<eos> Mind if I start?<eos> If you wish.<eos> My comments at the inn caught you off guard, and I'm sorry for that.
Am I interrupting?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Nicole, I've been thinking...<eos> Mind if I start?<eos> If you wish.<eos> My comments at the inn caught you off guard, and I'm sorry for that.<eos> But when I woke and saw you trying on my earrings, I...<eos> At the time... it's something I've wanted to talk to you about for a while.<eos> What I mean is it wasn't the first time I'd seen you with my jewelry.
I don't want to be a woman.<eos> Sometimes, I think wearing their clothes lets me inhabit them more completely.<eos> But the truth is I don't know where the desire comes from.<eos> It just is.<eos> And though I have to hide it from narrow minds, I won't deny myself the feeling it brings.<eos> Power, excitement, pleasure. Liberation from a world determined to tell me who to be.<eos> I am who I am.<eos> I want what I want.<eos> And I take what I want.<eos> If that scares you, if it repels you, then you're with the wrong man.
I need you to be happy.<eos> - Ah. - I do.<eos> You are more precious to me than my nation, and if I could give up England for you and survive, I would.<eos> But it's not even possible.<eos> Oh, no. I don't want you to give up anything.<eos> You just want me to stop lying to you, and I will, I swear.<eos> But I will lie to others.<eos> I will do anything to protect us.<eos> And that is what I did.<eos> I told the archduke I love you.
I told the archduke I love you.<eos> And I told him I would never give you up.<eos> Why would he agree to that?<eos> His family's already taken advantage of his rise in station.<eos> He needs this marriage.<eos> And I need to marry him, but...<eos> - But I will always, always be yours.<eos> So if you still think I can't be trusted, then let me make this vow, not only to you, but to God.<eos> Woven into this fabric from my mother's dress are her dreams of lasting love for me.<eos> The joy she would have felt knowing I'd met you.
It had to be.<eos> We have to go.<eos> I can't leave him... not like this.<eos> You can't be found with him, either.<eos> I sent a note to the nearest physician, claiming I'd come across... a body.<eos> I didn't sign it, but they'll be here soon.<eos> He won't be left for long, but you must leave.<eos> He'd want you to be safe.<eos> He loved you.<eos> I will find who did this to you, and when I do... they will know how much I love you.
I've not been in a dungeon, as you have.<eos> With cousins in the countryside, weren't you?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Darnley... they say you have taken part in a coup.<eos> It got... out of hand.<eos> I was a part of it, and then I was arrested for killing members of the privy council, but without witnesses for either crime, nothing can be proven.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> Please tell me that you didn't burn those men.<eos> I didn't want to at first, but... she convinced me that it was the only way to protect myself.<eos> She? Who convinced you?
She hated that I never emptied the dishwasher, and there were times that I wished she had a penis.<eos> Look, I'm sorry all this is coming out about Margaret.<eos> But as bad as this news about Rutger is for you, - it's good for your case.<eos> - Who cares about my case?<eos> The man came into my house, made love to my wife, and then put his foot on my wall.<eos> There are certain lines you just don't cross.<eos> Come on, Josh.<eos> What would you do?<eos> You're exactly like me.<eos> Not exactly. But I would... I would listen to my lawyer, who is telling you that nothing good will come out of confronting Rutger.
Plus, he wears Velcro shoes, which means he doesn't care what people think.<eos> Interesting, interesting.<eos> Dwayne, find out everything you can about juror number 9.<eos> Whale Shark.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - That's art!<eos> It's a picture of a man playing the cello with an erection.<eos> No, it's a man with an erection playing the cello.<eos> Watch your modifiers.<eos> Either way, we're trying to sell you as a wholesome family man.
This hospital room is now officially being called the Larry Henderson Room.<eos> More after this.<eos> ♪ The choice is clear, it's East Peck Glass ♪<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> - I love that commercial!<eos> I'm not sure everyone is grasping what a disaster yesterday was.<eos> We don't have Margaret's cellphone.<eos> Larry's former lover is now ready to testify against him.<eos> And what was the third thing? Ah, yes!<eos> We have replaced our sole sympathetic juror with Mrs. Kratt, who actively hates you.
Uh-uh. For after lunch.<eos> I got to stop leaving him with you people.<eos> I'm helping with his President's Day assignment.<eos> Getting him ready to cross the Delaware, so to speak.<eos> And we got to get ready to cross the Valley.<eos> We got a photo op at the Encino Petting Zoo.<eos> Petting zoo?<eos> Lots of kids.<eos> Kids love comics.<eos> You go in there and talk about keeping the Warlock's Chest open, parents like you, you get votes.
You're gonna scare yourself out of this election.<eos> You're scared of snakes.<eos> I was scared of snakes, until I reevaluated my position on them, from a rational point of view, and now my phobia is no more.<eos> Self-improvement is my new passion.<eos> Speaking of which, I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna call that waitress up from Kovelsky's who kept on pronouncing gyro as "jyro," and apologize.<eos> You've created a monster.<eos> I'm gonna reread the Lincoln/Douglas debates.<eos> We're not done talking about the petting zoo.<eos> Got you mocha. Does that work for you?
About 20 or so.<eos> I'm in their coop.<eos> He's cracked.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> I have no idea, but I know who to ask.<eos> Chickens?<eos> Well, to steal Happy's line, not good.<eos> I am sending you the security feed now and linking your phone to our comms.<eos> Okay, well, those are bona fide fear responses.<eos> Sly, pal, I'm watching you on the monitors right now, and there are no chickens in there with you.
Not me.<eos> Is that why you're sad?<eos> No.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Besides, I knew that nobody would want me 'cause I'm defective.<eos> That's not why you're still here.<eos> We just exited the '90s.<eos> The Spice Girls had number one hits.<eos> Half the women in America are wearing a haircut called "The Rachel," and everyone's investing in a Web site called, "Ask Jeeves."<eos> This is a decade where everyone's making bad decisions, so anyone who doesn't want you in their life?
Oh, it's all very interesting.<eos> Did you see something?<eos> A fear of yours?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe. No.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> I got to get some air.<eos> Okay.<eos> Any problem can be solved. Did you notice anything weird about Paige?<eos> Yeah, ergot can mess with you for a few days, she'll be fine.
Think he was setting her up for an ambush?<eos> No, he's always given her valuable intel.<eos> I mean, he told her about me being dropped in Times Square before it happened.<eos> Yeah, and he also gave Nas key details on Sandstorm's org chart, Shepherd's interest in me.<eos> It doesn't make sense that he suddenly turned against her.<eos> Okay, what if it wasn't him on the call?<eos> Sandstorm could've gotten that number and used it to set up a trap.<eos> Whoa, this drive is crazy encrypted.<eos> This is a lot of work for a decoy.<eos> How long is it gonna take you to decrypt it?
I want to meet.<eos> Drop the cash, or the deal's off.<eos> It's in the cart... now, where is Shepherd's meeting?<eos> Exit the building.<eos> Once you're outside, I'll give you her location.<eos> Hang back.<eos> Wait for the pickup.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Who told you to drop that bag?
Look, I grew up in a mining town.<eos> Mom died in labor, old man was all I had.<eos> He died on the job.<eos> Faulty mine shaft.<eos> Or a... what, an "act of God," according to the company lawyers.<eos> I wanted those bastards to pay.<eos> Tried to stage a few pickets, it didn't make much difference.<eos> Joined the Marine Corps, didn't find any answers there.<eos> I was... broken.<eos> And that's when Shepherd found you.
Whatever you want, I'll approve it.<eos> But, Edgar, whatever it is that you're going through, we can help you, but you need to...<eos> How the hell would you know what I need?<eos> I know that you need help, I know that I'm in no position to give it to you,<eos> - so, as your friend...<eos> - We're not friends.<eos> We're not family.<eos> - You're my boss, that's it.<eos> - Fine, as your boss,<eos> I'm advising you not to throw away your career with the FBI.
Please hear what I have to say.<eos> I will tolerate the Jedi presence in our ancestral home if they surrender their weapons.<eos> (SIGHS) Well, that went better than I expected.<eos> That was better?<eos> I hope you're not really expecting us to hand over our lightsabers, are you?<eos> We need to do whatever it takes to make this work.<eos> They'll be safe, Ezra.<eos> All right.<eos> Your rebel friends are going to bring the Empire down on all of us.<eos> You believe the Darksaber will protect you?
Please, don't tell me.<eos> He's alive.<eos> On Mandalore.<eos> A captive in everything but name.<eos> But if Clan Wren acts against the Empire... They'll kill him.<eos> Why didn't you try and find me?<eos> Find you?<eos> Sabine, when you ran away, it saved you.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Coming back here has put you in danger.
We all make sacrifices.<eos> Okay.<eos> AP-5, stand guard here and let us know if anyone's coming.<eos> Oh, good, the thankless job.<eos> See that trooper?<eos> Convince him you are Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Here is his code cylinder.<eos> Get him to open the door with it.<eos> I am Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Admiral Thrawn told you to expect us.
JESS: Let's take shelter in that cave!<eos> What if it's more of a nest than a cave?<eos> Whatever. It'll do.<eos> Sister!<eos> (both squealing)<eos> (chuckles)<eos> WINSTON: Oh, that's some sisterly love right there.<eos> - Let me get you two a drink. - Okay.<eos> (squeals)<eos> Oh, my God, Winston is so good for you.
What was your first impression of Erik?<eos> He was short.<eos> Everybody thought and told me that we were going to lose, 99 to 1, we're gonna lose.<eos> He doesn't just take no as an answer.<eos> Well, at first I thought, this is insurmountable.<eos> And I just disagreed with them, completely.<eos> How is it possibly legal that a company makes millions of dollars every year helping pimps sell human sex trafficking victims, including children.<eos> Why would Congress ever grant immunity to a company that engages in conduct like this?<eos> And he said, "Let's do this.<eos> Let's stop Backpage for what they've done to you."
Clearly to me, it seems to be this is an issue of money. was gonna do everything in their power to make sure that this bill wasn't signed.<eos> Backpage argues that Senate Bill 6251 would violate Section 230 of the CDA.<eos> That they have no responsibility for third party postings.<eos> The court agrees, and the bill dies.<eos> ♪ There's a lady ♪<eos> ♪ Such a lady ♪<eos> ♪ With perfect etiquette ♪<eos> ♪ She can cook An eight-course meal ♪<eos> ♪ And never break a sweat ♪<eos> ♪ Happy blessings to you God blessings to you ♪
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> Because I was about to tell you the Atlantians only wanna deal with you and that Filipino woman.<eos> - Is that what she is?<eos> - I was also gonna say that maybe for the first time in your life, I'm proud of you.<eos> - You can say it now.<eos> - Nah, moment's passed.<eos> Now get in there and close the deal, you piece of [bleep].<eos> Ah, Dad.<eos> Don't touch.<eos> Wait, so you really want me to walk you through how we process expense reports?
- Hold my drink. - Okay.<eos> Not a superhero.<eos> Okay.<eos> Attention, everyone, we have an announcement.<eos> Wayne Security has a new client.<eos> The Lost City of Atlantis!<eos> All right, now let's get our sink on!<eos> Bring out the tuna!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> ♪ Your daddy doesn't love you ♪

- Why wouldn't we enter the Wayne Innovation Contest?<eos> Because no one gives a crap about Wayne Security RD.<eos> You make widgets.<eos> You're nobodies.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ugh, our division matters.<eos> We are not nobodies.<eos> FYI, guys, corporate gave away your parking spots. So starting next week, you're gonna have to park across the street under the bridge that leaks tar.<eos> Oh. This child-sized car arrived for you.<eos> Were you expecting a full-size one or is it because your father didn't hug you?
It's cooped up in a cage.<eos> It's either open that door, set it free, let it fly out on the wings of... feathers...<eos> I don't... It's a bird, so it...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... look, it's 1,000 bucks.<eos> Grasp the furniture.<eos> Teddy ratted you out.<eos> What?<eos> He did?<eos> Yup, he sold you out faster than a Mumford Sons concert in the whitest part of Portland.
- What? - Finally.<eos> - No.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hmm? Keep it on.<eos> Keep it on.<eos> Keep it on.<eos> Missed you at coffee.<eos> I got you one anyways.<eos> Okay, obviously, you're still needing space.<eos> You know, I just want to say I've forgiven you for lying to me about needing the money for Six Flags...
Are you really gonna walk away from that?<eos> So are you walking away from that, or are you just... walking away?<eos> Ah, there she is!<eos> Who's ready for her first board meeting?<eos> This gal!<eos> I can't believe the board even knows who I am.<eos> They said if I wanted to bring a lesser person to make me feel important, that I could.<eos> Well, they'll know who I am soon.<eos> I've got some great ideas on the Wayne Security Poncho.<eos> Do you want me to tell you now or surprise you in front of the board?
Um, I'm sorry, I-I didn't get your name.<eos> - Van Wayne.<eos> - It's Emily.<eos> Emily Locke.<eos> I gave you that button for emergencies.<eos> Well, and this is an emergency, a work emergency, which some people would say is actually...<eos> I'm not hawking your dumb poncho.<eos> - I'm a superhero.<eos> - Yeah. You are.<eos> But right now, the world sees you like this.
- Who the hell's this dick?<eos> - Well...<eos> I'm Vanderveer Wayne, and for the record,<eos> I think The Olympian was crazy to dump yo' ass.<eos> He didn't dump me. I dumped him.<eos> No wonder the Justice League doesn't take me seriously when this crap is all they see.<eos> Well, what if we showed them something else?<eos> We will build a campaign that will show the world how strong, smart, and capable you are.<eos> The Justice League will come crawling for you.<eos> Yeah, and it doesn't matter how many guys dump you or how many doughnuts you stuff in your face to drown your sorrows.
Ruby is so awesome.<eos> She gives the best advice, like,<eos> "Sometimes a cloud makes you happy. Sometimes a cloud makes you sad."<eos> It's like, how does she know?<eos> I'm gonna shut down this friendship before Ruby also starts dressing like a sexually active grandma. - Oh!<eos> Thank you. - She's not here to play.<eos> She's being punished for punching another kid.<eos> Oh, Miles totally had it coming.<eos> She had a good reason.<eos> Wait, she told you why she punched him?
[Yermuther] Ma'am, that bit doesn't work without some kind of partition.<eos> What do you want, Kimmy?<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> The FBI is out there, and they have guns, and there's a dog with a badge.<eos> Why didn't I pet him?<eos> I was right there.<eos> He looked at me.<eos> What's going on? Oh! I'm just doing what you told me to do.<eos> Okay, I get that you want to blame me, but I didn't tell you to do this.
[clattering]<eos> Gretchen, your lamp broke, on its own.<eos> I saw you, Jasper!<eos> Wait. Where's all the firewood?<eos> We're building a ramp!<eos> [both] Yeah!<eos> [boy] Oh, my God, that's gross!<eos> -So gross!<eos> -[sighs]<eos> I never told you to kidnap a bunch of boys.
You didn't want me keeping that baby...<eos> You gave it to me to get rid of it.<eos> I was a child!<eos> What was I gonna do with a baby?<eos> She's found you, hasn't she?<eos> Fine, don't talk to me, but I'm not gonna be around much longer.<eos> Something terminal, I hope.<eos> I'm being extradited tomorrow.<eos> Mother England wants me home to face charges, the old bitch.<eos> Well, at least someone wants you.
Parenting's a cruel business.<eos> You'd never have stomached it.<eos> How could you give Chloe to the FBI?<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> You did it to protect yourself and your precious FBI deal.<eos> Chloe's gonna get you killed.<eos> Yeah, but what a way to go.<eos> Now she's never gonna want to see me again.<eos> She probably won't want to have sex with me.<eos> I will never forgive you for this.
No fighting, you two.<eos> There's more than enough of both of you.<eos> He knows we're listening.<eos> Please make it go faster so we don't have to.<eos> Now, now, Raoul, you know it's not polite to speak with your mouth...<eos> Data transfer complete.<eos> We just cloned Chloe Jackson's phone.<eos> A 15-year-old girl from Sheffield doesn't hire a hit man all by herself.<eos> So, you found out everything you could about the Kensington Firm and then you found someone else who wanted to take Margot down.<eos> Someone else who, based on the condoms in your purse, is clearly using you.
It's enough to give a girl ideas.<eos> But they weren't your ideas, were they?<eos> They were Felix McCall's.<eos> Who's Felix McCall?<eos> You don't know?<eos> Well, not to worry. He'll soon be dead.<eos> Given your management style, can you blame Felix for wanting a new boss?<eos> And that's you, is it?<eos> A 15-year-old girl?<eos> Is that what he promised you?

As much as she's capable of loving anyone.<eos> She may have even thought he was the one.<eos> Maybe he wanted her to have the baby, begged her to have it.<eos> But in the end, she couldn't do it. She was too selfish.<eos> She hated the baby.<eos> She wanted it gone, so... she lied and told him it was stillborn.<eos> I think he knew she was lying.<eos> I think that's when he started hating her.<eos> You must hate her, too. After everything she's done to you.<eos> Everything they've done to you.
I'll find Tucker and meet you at home.<eos> Boy, am I lonely.<eos> If only I could have sex with someone.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> I don't know how much longer I can stand to see you rotting away like this.<eos> Bonnie, it's only been two hours.<eos> But I'm scared.<eos> Three prison gangs want me and I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.<eos> Listen. All right, don't worry.<eos> Riley is gonna get you out of here.
You love me more than you love yourself?<eos> But you love you so much.<eos> I know.<eos> And that is why I am setting you free, Bon-Bon.<eos> Well, there you go, you wanna share a cab?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You are my husband, and I love you, and I will wait for you.<eos> Even if it takes forever.<eos> Because I love you more than you love you, too.
That's awesome.<eos> Wow. Look at that.<eos> A hooker with a heart of gold.<eos> Those don't exist.<eos> It's gonna cost you $500.<eos> Cash... best friend.<eos> Cash... best friend.<eos> Ca... This might take a while.<eos> Well, here we are again,<eos> Bad Dad waking you up in the middle of the night for a snack.
This is a political game of chess.<eos> You like chess?<eos> I like boxing.<eos> I see that.<eos> Now I love chess myself.<eos> Requires patience and understanding strategy and of human weakness. Plus you always get to be king.<eos> Not that I don't appreciate the pep talk, but I don't.<eos> Settle down.<eos> I'm trying to protect you, and if you really wanna see justice done, you will gather the facts... just the facts, and let the powers that be do the rest.<eos> I shouldn't have to remind you that no one in this room is under arrest.
I don't think it. I know, so I did what I did.<eos> I'd do it again, and I'm now prepared to accept the consequences of my actions.<eos> Good, because, Agent Montgomery you're under arrest, for willful theft, malfeasance, and destruction of government property.<eos> I need your badge.<eos> Hello, Amelia.<eos> Thank you for, uh, for meeting me.<eos> Ed and I had no secrets, Clara.<eos> I came here today because I know that you were important to his life, and I really need someone to get justice for him and for Keri.<eos> That's exactly what I intend to do.<eos> May I see the photos that he e-mailed you?
Hey, gun! Gun! I need help in here!<eos> Go, go.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Give me that!<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Release.<eos> Got it. Lock him down.<eos> I want belly chains, full restraints.<eos> Now!<eos> Yes, sir. You're gonna pay for this. It's gonna cost you.
Oh, geez. Beale... what?<eos> Beale, what is it?<eos> Kensi was abducted by the guy she was talking to.<eos> Sullivan.<eos> Who the hell's Sullivan?<eos> He's a vet from rehab.<eos> Listen, you need to get that footage to LAPD right now, Detective Ellen Whiting. Do you understand?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> What?<eos> Those things'll kill you.
Have we ever met?<eos> I'm Beck.<eos> Beck was Robert's best friend.<eos> I may have lost my virginity to him.<eos> When I think of a princess I always think of Eleanor.<eos> That's what Eleanor is.<eos> She's a real princess.<eos> So I guess you're not mad at me anymore?<eos> I do what I want and right now, I want to do this.<eos> I spent a lot of time in my brother's shadow but it wasn't okay the day I met you.
Now, magenta says, "A queen must be seen to be believed."<eos> But, the white says, "new beginnings."<eos> Yeah, but it also says "virgin".<eos> Fine.<eos> The magenta.<eos> Now, this is for you to wear on the balcony today.<eos> You gotta stop dropping acid, it's becoming a problem.<eos> Years ago, I wore it on the balcony.<eos> Then it went out of fashion and that's where it stayed.<eos> It was the day your father and I presented you to the world for the first time.
No.<eos> The press will recognize it and it will symbolize our mother-daughter unity.<eos> They'll write about it for weeks.<eos> Mum, today is about Robby.<eos> It's not about me or what I'm wearing.<eos> Or you, for that matter.<eos> What's best for Robby is peace between you and me, privately and publicly, which hasn't always been the case.<eos> I'll try it for size.<eos> So, how have you been, K?<eos> Prince's Arms treating you well?
Caliber has a very different meaning here in the palace.<eos> You're not good enough for her.<eos> Don't get above your station.<eos> HRH!<eos> - Big day, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry, got to dash.<eos> Gotta grab the Order of the Royal Garter from the Beefeaters.<eos> May I have permission to throw him off the goddamn roof?<eos> What shit did he say to you?
- Well, did you?<eos> Robert wanted to keep it a secret, so, no.<eos> And with Liam, the relationship was over before it began.<eos> That's the thing, even though it was so brief, the connection I had with Liam felt so real.<eos> It felt like things were serious.<eos> I still can't believe this is happening.<eos> I always said the Davis girls would go far!<eos> Robert never intended it to go anywhere but then today...<eos> Okay, under normal circumstances, I'd say dump him.<eos> He kept you a secret because you're common, the prick.
Dear old Richard III, yeah.<eos> But you wouldn't put Liam and I under the stairs in the Tower.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> Come on, Scar.<eos> Don't be grumpy.<eos> It's me.<eos> Where's the chap I used to go to when Dad was too hard on me?<eos> Where's the chap who gave me my first sip of liquor?<eos> And my second.<eos> Took you to Madame Gigi, too.
_<eos> I'm not going anywhere, you know.<eos> Maybe it won't be me, but it'll be someone just like me.<eos> You know you're not good enough for her.<eos> You never will be.<eos> I only tell you what you want to hear.<eos> To get what I want.<eos> You're Vegas scum with fuzzy eyebrows. Definitely not a prince.<eos> You dumb son of a bitch.<eos> Relationships worked out so well for you in the past.
To warn us to keep Kira away from Dyad.<eos> And she and Cosima have identified whatever gene they're looking for in Kira?<eos> Westmorland's fountain of youth gene.<eos> LIN28A.<eos> Maybe that's the same gene that makes my mouse's skin grow back.<eos> Delphine is gonna rendezvous with Adele and Felix in Geneva.<eos> They've sent new dirt on the Neo money trail.<eos> Rachel has been busy.<eos> Neolution-infiltrated companies have made huge acquisitions in healthcare and also some... Some kind of odd sectors, but maybe Delphine can give us some context with that.<eos> Okay, I see how Delphine can be involved in this, but is she the source who got you Coady?
Virginia Coady is here?<eos> Yes, she escaped.<eos> And he brought her here.<eos> Her influence is the last thing we need.<eos> He's losing his grip. He's going to destroy everything.<eos> - Did she ask about me?<eos> - Ira, she is a monster.<eos> Yes, but she created CASTOR.<eos> As a weapon.<eos> I raised you as a human being.
A longer life.<eos> We came for the fountain.<eos> And only found death.<eos> What happened...<eos> Baby has no father.<eos> Where do I go from here?<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Vaguely.<eos> Well, you were only four when Susan separated you.
Vaguely.<eos> Well, you were only four when Susan separated you.<eos> It was tough for everyone.<eos> How you screamed, leaving your brothers.<eos> Are there any of my brothers left?<eos> Hold here.<eos> Pick. Just one.<eos> Good boy.<eos> These children... What is this all for?<eos> Susan certainly remade you in her image, didn't she?
She left that... _<eos> Don't go back to Springfield.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - There's something here.<eos> You feel it, too.<eos> Hey, sorry, I'm looking for Anna.<eos> Discharged about a half hour ago.<eos> Casey! I need help!<eos> Hey! You get me out of here.<eos> I'll kill you, I swear. I will kill you!
Excuse me.<eos> Sitting and waiting, not really in a firefighter's skill set.<eos> I work for Hank Voight, so I can handle a little attitude, Chief.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds like they're getting closer.<eos> I keep going over that call.<eos> - If I'd just gotten him out of there, then...<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> I'm the one who left him there.<eos> You did everything you could for a guy waving a gun at you.
Kidd, run!<eos> We good?<eos> Find out in a second.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> That's your shooter.<eos> - I'm riding with you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And for the record... I still don't like when people shoot at you.
That's funny.<eos> I find every trial has a different dynamic.<eos> Jace,<eos> Would you mind excusing us for just a moment?<eos> Just when it's getting good.<eos> Jace, why don't I show you around?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Thank you, marissa.<eos> When, um, don suggested,<eos> Actually, insisted I hire you,
St. Andrews?<eos> Ooh, how about something hard?<eos> Bethpage black, from the tips.<eos> Okay.<eos> She, read you the riot act?<eos> I get the feeling she didn't play a lot of. Team sports growing up, but she likes games.<eos> Which brings us to the question of the day...<eos> Did I throw the game?<eos> Very unorthodox swing, but nice drive.<eos> A slight fade might've helped you with the virtual wind.
Like, around 2:00.<eos> That's the same time as the titanfall regionals.<eos> Really?<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> Think about it.<eos> So I started with dewey, like you asked, But his play seemed perfectly legit.<eos> So then I moved on to jace.<eos> Take a look at that.<eos> It's a crap offer, and you know it.<eos> Didn't ask you here to talk about the offer.

If it isn't el capitan.<eos> Congrats, man, I'm glad you guys settled. Yeah.<eos> Casa dv8 hasn't been the same.<eos> Team.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> Let's get back to it, bro.<eos> One big, happy family.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> A dysfunctional family.<eos> You were a snotnosed little pockmarked. Mall rat when I found you.
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie, and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto, which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.<eos> At first, Grayson said her name didn't ring a bell, but then he called me out of the blue and asked me if we were still looking into it.<eos> So I followed up.<eos> You looked through my notes.<eos> You're out.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're fired, Jeffries.<eos> It's a story.<eos> I was following it.<eos> I don't want you on my team.
I'll do my best.<eos> - That went rather well, I think. - It did.<eos> It went very well.<eos> You've exceeded everyone's expectations, the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...<eos> Brockhart's someone they can predict.<eos> Don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> This is not over.<eos> What are you gonna do, Francis?<eos> Are you gonna use the oppo?<eos> Well, it seems to have worried you enough.
I hear those weekends can, uh, take some recovery time.<eos> I must say, I didn't expect to be back here so soon.<eos> Well, Mark, we asked you back here because... we've come into possession of a second audio recording of your candidate on an airplane.<eos> - He's been recorded saying...<eos> - I know what he said.<eos> I was there.<eos> So, we were wondering if we can discuss how... we might be able to work together.<eos> We can accomplish a great deal.<eos> The three of us.<eos> Now, before you say anything, let me tell you how this conversation's going to go.
Just here for the inauguration and the parties. Hmm.<eos> So I imagine you've heard that I'm on the outs.<eos> They're not telling the whole story.<eos> So what happened?<eos> An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to Russia.<eos> They're blaming me for it.<eos> What did this acquaintance take?<eos> That's just the thing.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> If you could find him, talk to him, he would tell you that I had nothing to do with this.
- Aidan...<eos> How does she even know I'm here?<eos> Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.<eos> Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.<eos> You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood, hmm?<eos> - How you helped steal an election.<eos> - That would be it for me.<eos> You're a valued guest of the Russian state.<eos> I want my passport back.<eos> An American passport is the last thing that will keep you safe.
Her contacts are ready and waiting.<eos> - We'll have distance, Francis.<eos> - We'll owe her.<eos> You look very beautiful.<eos> Presidential.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Vice Presidential.<eos> Here we are.<eos> The night of Zoe's death.<eos> Who does that look like to you?
Before I forget, LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she wanted me to tell you that she's... she's all right.<eos> She's gonna be all right.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> She's, um, taking a leave of absence.<eos> Well, that's what they're calling it, but it... it seems that she's being pushed out of the administration.<eos> Mmm-hmm. She's the one who told me you were here.<eos> Suggested I talk to you.<eos> LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?
Maybe it's the sun or the dust, but people kind of squint when they say hello.<eos> I always liked that.<eos> I never should've left.<eos> You've always been very good to me.<eos> I liked your mother.<eos> I liked her a lot.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> There's a guard on the second floor working with us.<eos> He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.
I think we should give it a little more time.<eos> You know, I wonder if it was such a good idea to bring you in on this.<eos> - You promised...<eos> - I know.<eos> I know. Ahmadi...<eos> We've got Special Forces on the ground, tracking.<eos> Russia's presence in Syria is making this more difficult than I once thought.<eos> I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.<eos> It never ceases to astonish me how talented men are at making a mess.<eos> Uh, it's not gonna serve you to go after your own party.
He's clean and crisp as a starched white shirt.<eos> You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.<eos> You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?<eos> I have already reached out to members of my own party.<eos> I've used my political capital to help you.<eos> But you're still not answering my question.<eos> I think I have.<eos> And I don't need to convince you or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.<eos> Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up with you momentarily.
- Please, you know you did.<eos> - See how easy that is?<eos> - Get out!<eos> You're gonna be all alone at your hearing.<eos> I just left Walker.<eos> He's gonna plead the Fifth.<eos> You'll look like a fool.<eos> You want to be out front?<eos> No one has a problem with that.<eos> They want you there, because you'll be the first to fall.
Yes, you were.<eos> You stole the presidency, Frank.<eos> Now, Garrett...<eos> This is ancient history, but by modern political standards, my election was a landslide.<eos> I was gonna change this country.<eos> But then... uh, things happen.<eos> People lie...<eos> You lie to keep up.<eos> The things that you've been lauded for all your life, those are suddenly fatal flaws.<eos> People who've been with you through thick and thin, who you thought would never fail you, they fail you.
Come on.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What did you think was going on here?<eos> I'm not fucking you because I like you.<eos> I'm fucking you because I hate you.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out of my car.<eos> Get the fuck out of my car.<eos> Get out!<eos> What did Macallan give you?
You got something from him.<eos> What do you mean you heard me?<eos> Were you watching me, too?<eos> Who was he to you?<eos> Want a drink?<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I was with him.<eos> When I was young and shouldn't have been with him.<eos> What gets you off, Doug?
I really wish I could have changed your mind, Cathy.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Because, you know... you know, this is just not good for you.<eos> The negotiations with the committee are just too far down the road.<eos> Well, you agreed to see me because you're smart. Because doubt is what you should be having.<eos> Look, Cathy, I respect you.
- Well, you can count it out.<eos> - No.<eos> No...<eos> And half of the Democrats as well.<eos> Forget about censure, the House hasn't even voted yet on articles of impeachment.<eos> You're not the only one working the Senate.<eos> - Someone wants Francis out.<eos> - And I'm asking you who.<eos> You've been around a long time.<eos> Nobody tells you how to vote.
- No, you'll have the best lawyers.<eos> The best of everything.<eos> The best.<eos> Would you like some more fish?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Whatever the Herald has is circumstantial.<eos> Of course.<eos> No one knows what really happened to her, and no one ever will.<eos> But, look, Doug...<eos> The reason that Claire and I invited you over tonight is because we want you to know how much you mean to us. To both of us.
No, I'm just saying, you just need to go away for a little while.<eos> And we'll bring you back into the fold at a later date, and don't worry.<eos> Look at LeAnn.<eos> She left and now she's back.<eos> Have we ever had a drink together?<eos> Never.<eos> I wanted to hand this to you while you were still president.<eos> I accept this with a heavy heart.<eos> I had a strategy session with the attorneys yesterday.<eos> I hope they're treating you well.
That would be outrageous.<eos> Well, it isn't official until I submit a signed letter.<eos> And what would that do to the rest of your presidency?<eos> What would be left of it?<eos> Claire, if you don't do it, you're gonna risk being married to a felon.<eos> And if I do, where does that leave me?<eos> Look, is this really the conversation you want to be having?<eos> You've trapped me, Francis.<eos> No, I do not accept that I've done something to you.<eos> I have provided you with an opportunity.
I'm glad to hear that.<eos> It was never in doubt.<eos> I just needed to think about how.<eos> So how long does this arrangement last?<eos> For the time being.<eos> How did we get here, Francis?<eos> Oh, let it go.<eos> It's done.<eos> Oh, and one word of advice.<eos> Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president, that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.
- So catchy!<eos> - Right?<eos> It's a story of four women who come together to mourn the loss of the family patriarch.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> So sad, so very sad.<eos> Pace yourself, crazy.<eos> We haven't even started.<eos> A man died, Claire.<eos> A fake man, and if he was a patriarch, he was a fake old man, and old men die.<eos> Surely, this is a thought that has occurred to you from time to time, huh?
No.<eos> Sneaking off with your phone, the clean hair, your one bra that fits properly... spill.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> There is a dude.<eos> Oh, God, it's not another high-school boy, is it?<eos> No. He's legal.<eos> He's just embarrassing in a different way.<eos> You know you've been like this your whole life... ashamed of the romantic, sexual part of you.<eos> Honestly, it seems like you think you don't deserve it, but you do.<eos> And if this guy is fun and good to you and doesn't ride a scooter, let it be okay.
Oh, so now it's my fault?<eos> I am lashing out at you because this is not the first time... I've been accused of this.<eos> I am sorry I haven't said it before, Gloria. I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Mm. - Okay.<eos> My God, you're right.<eos> It is trite.<eos> - You got this, Sam! - Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> You on the other hand... you throw one more gutter ball, and I will literally frame you for murder.
You're both Fizbo.<eos> When I'm with one of you, the other's wearing the costume, creating the perfect alibi.<eos> Light-bulb moment!<eos> This clown thing again.<eos> Look, Tucker, if I wanted to get back at you for, oh, I don't know, say something like setting me up with your straight father-in-law, I certainly wouldn't do it by stealing your stupid Bozo suit.<eos> - It's Fizbo.<eos> - Way to take the high road, sweetie.<eos> First, I'd hack your e-mails, then I'd create several fake social-media accounts, which I would use to mount the multi-pronged smear campaign to drive a wedge between you and everything you love.<eos> That's maybe a bit of a red flag.<eos> And then I'd get several credit cards in your name and then embark on a massive identity-theft scheme that would leave you bankrupt and, with any luck at all, facing criminal charges.
Ray, I don't know you, but you seem like a horse's ass.<eos> All right, now!<eos> Grow up!<eos> Start acting like gentlemen.<eos> Uh, would you two mind stepping out in the hall for a second?<eos> - I need to have a word with Phil.<eos> - All right, but hurry up. We don't want to miss the unlacing of the first wench.<eos> You know, I really appreciate all you've done arranging my party, but, you know,<eos> I'm happy doing whatever.<eos> Is something else bothering you?
Mitchell and Haley always come back giggling over shared secrets, and I feel left out.<eos> I once tried to start my own uncle-niece tradition, but...<eos> I'm not questioning the methodology behind accelerated mass spectrometry.<eos> I'm merely pointing out that it's not singular in its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass.<eos> What's going on with you and that handsome weatherman?<eos> - Things are great, mostly. Yeah.<eos> - Mm!<eos> Oh. "Mostly"?<eos> Well, what's... what's going on?<eos> I mean, do you think it's okay... for your partner to ask you to do... anything?
Mm, no.<eos> Not anything anything.<eos> I mean, we all have our boundaries.<eos> I mean, there are still things I wouldn't ask Cam to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, um,<eos> Rainer and I were in bed the other night, and...<eos> And?<eos> He asked me to do something I'm not totally comfortable with.<eos> What'd he ask you to do?
- He's with Margaret.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> I'm gonna bring him in here, have him check out this fish.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> - Getting back to this wood.<eos> Dad, the wood is fine.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Turns out, the wood doesn't just make people sick. It also kills fish.<eos> Well, I couldn't let Dad know I bought murder wood, so I sent Ben to get a replacement fish from the tank in the lobby.<eos> So, those seem right to you? Hmm?
I almost started to feel something for you, but then when you said you don't feel guilty, my rage returned tenfold.<eos> And I need that rage.<eos> It gets me up in the morning.<eos> Well, if it helps you, I eat everything I want, and I work out like once a year.<eos> You're horrible.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> All right, guys... tie game, three seconds left.<eos> There's only one thing that they're not gonna be expecting.<eos> - We're gonna get the ball to Phil. - What?<eos> They're not even guarding you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go pick up my son's anti-spazz suppositories.<eos> Mom, why?<eos> Because we're above it all now.<eos> Listen to Mommy.<eos> [Clara] This morning's reading is from Saint James.<eos> "Humble yourself, and God will give you grace.<eos> Brothers and sisters, do not slander or judge one another, for who are you to judge your neighbor?"<eos> Whoomp, here this is!<eos> Testimony!<eos> That usually comes later, Sister Kimmy, but as the Spirit moves you.
I went to Haiti to have voodoo done on a bunch of youse.<eos> [congregation murmuring] Amen! [Clara] I know.<eos> I'm a gossip... and a scold.<eos> But I pray every day for the strength to do better.<eos> Amen. [Clara] I got to do better.<eos> [congregation murmuring] Amen! So...<eos> I guess real religion is about knowing we're not perfect<eos> -but trying to be better.<eos> -[congregation murmuring]<eos> Together. Fake religion locks you in a box if you spill the toilet pumpkin 'cause someone tied your hair to the crank.
Sorry, is that "Gary" with one R or two?<eos> Would you stop writing?<eos> So... did all of you go on to better relationships after me?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Without question.<eos> Little before, actually.<eos> Don't let him get away.<eos> Wait.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.
Yeah, well, I'm sorrier, so I should go with you.<eos> No way! I'm going!<eos> Screw you!<eos> I'm going!<eos> What makes you think she wants to go with you?<eos> Because we never spend any time together!<eos> (arguing continues indistinctly) And I'm back to being fought over.<eos> Order restored.<eos> Look... all you have to do is sit through one dinner, and when they call for another date,<eos> I will tell them I dumped you.
Totally fine with that, Doody.<eos> Oh, man, that gift just keeps on giving.<eos> I can't believe you did this to me!<eos> Hey, I thought it'd be funny to see you squirm in front of your ex.<eos> It wasn't my idea to lie about being your husband.<eos> Well, I panicked!<eos> I couldn't tell him you're a broke actor, and I'm a knocked-up single woman who doesn't even know who the father is.<eos> And now, thanks to you, I have to tap dance through another meal.<eos> Hey, if they ask us out again?<eos> Feel free to say I dumped you.
It will be.<eos> It is.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What on earth was she doing up there?<eos> Oh, sorry, Ellen, I know you probably don't want to talk about it.<eos> You must feel terrible.<eos> I just can't sleep trying to work out why.<eos> Did you see anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Why did she call you?
Mummy's in the freezer.<eos> Her phone?<eos> Yeah - did you keep it?<eos> Wh-Why would you want Kay's phone?<eos> Because there might be something on it.<eos> You know, I don't know what makes you think that you've got more of a right to be upset about this than I have.<eos> Kay thought you were having an affair. Was it with Paula?<eos> Look, I don't think you were having an affair, I don't believe you even entertained the notion of having an affair - but that she lives in hope, that I can believe.<eos> You mean, I gave her enough encouragement to push my wife off a roof.<eos> If you're so sure there's nothing dodgy, just let me see Kay's phone and if there's nothing on it, I won't bother you again.
Why the fuck are we even discussing this?<eos> Just please go home, Ellen.<eos> Just go home.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did she settle?<eos> I'm afraid he called Lucy, so he knows when you left the office.<eos> Right.<eos> You feel she was pushed?<eos> It's more than a feeling.<eos> By the woman who replaced you?
Paula's handling it.<eos> Vernon has got used to her, that's all.<eos> The library means something to me.<eos> Me too.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So we're fine.<eos> I've got a meeting - can I go?<eos> Who with?<eos> Jarman McCreadie. I'm late.<eos> Have I told you I love you today?
Do you even understand what that means?<eos> Pretending Caris is alive isn't privacy.<eos> Well, do you want to explain to me what you'd do?<eos> You go home now and Lia's gone, what would you do?<eos> Go on... try and imagine it, so don't you dare tell me how to deal with it.<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> - I'd-I'd like to leave now, please.<eos> Yeah, cos it's not very nice, is it?<eos> Can you let me leave now, please, Paula?<eos> I just told you that my daughter's dead and you haven't even said sorry.
- Thank you.<eos> - Why don't we start with the Hyatt award?<eos> Are you still friends?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Paula.<eos> You used to work together at Jarman McCreadie.<eos> You're thinking of someone else.<eos> Georgia!<eos> You're frightened of her.<eos> I'm sorry to call you again, but Ellen Rooney just turned up for an interview.
I put it there.<eos> Where did you land with the underfloor heating?<eos> Paula talked me into it.<eos> She's done a great job.<eos> No, you both have. - Thanks.<eos> Nice to see you, Vernon.<eos> Stay away from her.<eos> I would if she would stay away from me.<eos> She's been spiking all my references.<eos> I don't want to sound like a broken record but just because you didn't land a job doesn't mean someone's sabotaging you.
And the fee's taken care of for the next two years.<eos> It's really extravagant.<eos> Not for peace of mind.<eos> Whilst Ellen's going through her treatment... you can never be too careful.<eos> The visits are supervised. She's not going to be left alone.<eos> Well if you ever need any help, you know where I am.<eos> See you, Lia.<eos> Say bye? Say bye-bye?<eos> You're not fighting me, you're fighting everyone.<eos> Not one agency is going to support you in this.
- Until what?<eos> - Until we're raided by the FBI.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> - The FBI's coming here?<eos> - As soon as they get a warrant.<eos> The Feds are not gonna get a peek at our clients' business.<eos> Be ready to hit the kill switch.<eos> Colonel Jackson.<eos> Hey.<eos> You seem like a good guy, is what I don't get, being all you can be. I bet your soldiers look up to you.
Well, what's Lieutenant Dale gonna do without Benny?<eos> Give the closing argument?<eos> Me?<eos> The members want to hear from you.<eos> Walk them through what you did.<eos> Start with the bombing. - Go.<eos> - At 0530 on 1 December, a unit from the 28th Armored Brigade deployed a series of laser-guided bombs - together with Maverick missiles...<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no, stop.<eos> I ask you to tell me about a traumatic car wreck, and you read me the accident report?
Okay, this one looks good... it's huge.<eos> That's what's bothering you?<eos> I jumped in to save you!<eos> You were flailing. You were drowning in a sea of unnecessary details.<eos> How?<eos> That's the way I like to tell a story.<eos> I like to paint a picture.<eos> A story should be short and simple.<eos> Don't tell me anything I don't need to know.<eos> I am taking you on a journey.
I know...<eos> I look great.<eos> One of the few perks of getting up there is the ability to say no without guilt.<eos> "Can I have a ride to the airport?" No.<eos> Do I want to see your niece's recital?<eos> Nuh-unh.<eos> "Want to do a walk-a-thon to end global..."<eos> I'm gonna stop you right there.<eos> Was anyone in my room last night?<eos> Not after I tucked you in.
Impossible.<eos> If he came across the roof, there'd be broken tiles or monster prints or...<eos> My monogrammed money clip.<eos> I snuck in through Joe's window last night because it was past curfew, and I must have dropped my clip on the roof.<eos> I needed to get it before Mom saw.<eos> I can't afford to get grounded.<eos> David Sedaris is coming to Barnes and Noble on a school night.<eos> I guess I can go out on the roof and check for monster slobber.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No! If he falls from the roof and dies, his ghost will haunt you forever.
How, uh... how you doing?<eos> Well, I got my rings, got my vows.<eos> Now all I need is a way to escape.<eos> Please, someone help.<eos> I'm kidding, of course.<eos> Actually, I'm really looking forward to being married.<eos> Then... then what's with the getaway bag?<eos> Oh, I got to ask you to help me out with what I think is a doozy of a surprise.<eos> Come here. Get this... mid-ceremony, you know, when you ask - if anyone has any objections?<eos> - Yeah? I'm gonna pull out a Tommy gun and tell you to skip that part.
You're attached to everything related to that kid.<eos> Yeah, but not to that stupid crib.<eos> Do you know how many clothes I've ruined walking by it... nice dresses, sweaters, a pair of high heels?<eos> How do you snag a pair of high heels?<eos> I kicked that stupid thing.<eos> How else?<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Ay! My trap worked!<eos> I caught the monster!<eos> I got you now, monster!
I thought you said something about that we had a busy day.<eos> No. No, I'm just happy to be here watching a career get launched. - Oh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, tell me if they call my name.<eos> I'm gonna go pretty down. - Mm.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Can you believe her?<eos> She just barges into our life and expects us to drop everything and invest in this crazy dream.<eos> Well, she really does look like someone who just broke her mop.<eos> Okay, what is going on with you?
- Thanks.<eos> I like to bounce at least 20 minutes a day.<eos> - It's where I get my best ideas.<eos> - Okay.<eos> How quirky.<eos> Oh, hey, Phil, where were Nationals senior year?<eos> Cleveland, Oh... Hi-o!<eos> Can you imagine putting up with this for years on end?<eos> It's hard.<eos> Tell you what, I'll give it some bounce time and hit you back with an answer.
Oh, that's setting a great example.<eos> What do you think would've happened if Marie Curie had given up?<eos> She wouldn't have died of radiation poisoning.<eos> How on Earth did you know that?<eos> You talk about her a lot.<eos> Until I saw her on that stamp, I thought she was your girlfriend.<eos> Gloria, I can't believe you don't know how to change a tire.<eos> You drove a taxi. Surely you had a flat.<eos> I had a lot of flats, but I would reapply my makeup and I would wait and then, in five minutes, I would have my own pit crew.<eos> You know, after we get this tire changed, do you still want to go to the rally or should we just drop you off in 1950?
In the beginning, I... I was a mess, so I let you take the lead.<eos> I don't know, m-maybe I'm just... trying to prove something to myself.<eos> Oh, sweetie, I had no idea.<eos> But you don't have anything to prove because you're a great dad.<eos> You both are... but I'm a disaster.<eos> - No, white couch.<eos> Let's get you up.<eos> - White couch.<eos> I don't think I can do all this by myself.<eos> Well, you know what, the good news is, is you don't have to do any of this all by yourself, because you have a family right down here who loves you and will do anything we need to do to help you.
- Not it.<eos> So, women can't win.<eos> They're penalized if they work and they're penalized if they stay home.<eos> Exactly!<eos> You know, Luke, when I woke up this morning and came to the rally... I never thought I would meet somebody like you.<eos> You're up.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I can't believe she's falling for this.<eos> I've believed in this cause my whole life.<eos> You spend an afternoon faking it and she kisses you almost on the lips.
That's so awesome.<eos> There must have been a lot of prejudice back then.<eos> There was... but eventually, she started fixing Irish people's cars.<eos> Huh.<eos> Well, uh, Lily, why don't you finish it off.<eos> I'm not strong enough.<eos> Well, then let me help you.<eos> We're stronger together.<eos> We are stronger together.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry I put you down before.
Daddy, want to come throw with me?<eos> - Oh, I'm actually in the middle of...<eos> - Not you.<eos> - Oh, uh, yeah, but just for a bit while, uh, Gloria and Joe go through some of your old toys in the garage.<eos> - I'll fly there.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Okay, vamanos!<eos> Kid loves that cape.<eos> So, I see your stance on sons wearing accessories has evolved.<eos> The cape gives him superpowers.<eos> What did leg warmers give you?
So do it.<eos> Asking Cam to go away alone is three weeks of wounded crazy that I... I don't want to deal with right now.<eos> Don't ask, tell.<eos> Isn't that what you fought for?<eos> Okay, I don't know what to address first.<eos> Uh, Jay, Gloria's ready to go.<eos> All right.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> You have a good one, too... Mrs. Tucker.<eos> Why'd he call you Mrs. Tucker?
I've got the address here somewhere.<eos> (Chaos is a friend of Mine)<eos> It's not that.<eos> I think I can remember it.<eos> Crouch End Hill ...?<eos> Crouch ...<eos> Hill Road ...<eos> End.<eos> Some of those words in all of that order, or all of those words in some of that order, or none of those words, -but let's keep some kind of order here.<eos> I'll tell you what, boss, let's get you up that way and we can work out exactly where you wanna be dropped.
- See you soon, Bob.<eos> - Yes, Ange.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Oh, Ange ...<eos> Yes, love?<eos> He hides the remote in the plant pot.<eos> Well, he seems like a nice man.<eos> A bit odd but nice.<eos> How do ya know him again?<eos> Ange ... there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
He says he's never had a rival, but I don't buy it.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Everyone has someone.<eos> Well, my someone is no one.<eos> But Villa's someone has a Great Dane named Herschel and gives to charity.<eos> You looked up my high-school rival?<eos> When this is all over, I'm doing a documentary on you guys.<eos> All right, look, I think that Alexander there is dirty.<eos> And since I didn't get a Christmas present from you, I want the proof wrapped up in a nice bow.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't get the H3GB that I sent you?
Oh, yeah?<eos> This a glitch, too?<eos> And garlic needs about 30 seconds to a minute... (Eastern European accent) Chucky.<eos> You brought guests.<eos> Detective Villa, East Miami PD.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Pretty sure she's his mistress.<eos> - Rosie, keep your eyes on Furwell.<eos> - I got it. I'm zeroed in on this bitch.<eos> Okay, so, tell me why Chucky moved you into his empty building and neglected to tell us.
Magic?<eos> Cap, I'm not a wizard.<eos> Okay, it's all about hard work and dedication.<eos> I'm doing the same thing I've always done... except with a... little more heart.<eos> See ya, Cap.<eos> Text me as soon as you have an update.<eos> Will do.<eos> MICAH: I have an update.<eos> Um, I couldn't say anything in front of the guys, um, but I know why Bobby's face was marked with our ring.<eos> I really hope this doesn't end with her slapping cuffs on you.
I wouldn't kill him!<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Well, love makes you do some crazy things... even to family.<eos> You're in a funk and you're not talking to me?<eos> Oh, you're breaking all kinds of sibling codes, bro.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't believe I was wrong about those guys.<eos> They were tearing each other apart.<eos> That doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> You know the worst fights are always between family... 'cause they're the ones that know you the best.
So, how's Adrian?<eos> I get that you're seeing the world with fresh eyes.<eos> It's your life.<eos> But, I mean, I don't see what was wrong with the old Hornstock.<eos> Okay, so, the only way the elevator would have accelerated that quickly is if someone had interfered with the velocity transducer, which is in there.<eos> We thought Rick Wu had hacked into the access-control system, but the transducer ran on a separate network.<eos> So whoever killed Bobby Huff had to go in there and manually adjust the transducer.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> Basic systems engineering, Villa.<eos> You know, you'd better study up, or the future's gonna pass you by.
All right, we got to get out of here. Come on.<eos> Before they bust in...<eos> This is not what I meant when I said I wanted to go out with a bang on my last tour.<eos> Hey. Here you go, drink that.<eos> Slow.<eos> You want to tell me why those grease monkeys want you dead?<eos> They killed a Navy sailor, and I'm not gonna let them get away with it.<eos> If you're gonna take out those fools, I'm with you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you gonna do with that?<eos> Where I grew up, if someone takes a swing at you, you swing back.
You take me to those signal beacons.<eos> I'll get word to my team, get backup. We'll take these guys down.<eos> Hey, I'm not looking to get deputized here.<eos> And I'm not much for "we," okay?<eos> So you do you and I'll do me.<eos> Maybe find another one of those flare guns.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Bonnie, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, I need you to do what I tell you to do.
Sebastian!<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> Ow, ow, cut it out, cut it out, ow, ow.<eos> I said no more cell phones, Lund.<eos> You got yourself killed, and your team, too! I can explain.<eos> No, you can't, because you are dead.<eos> Dead men do not talk.<eos> Yeah, but the point is my team keeps calling me, and I-I can't...<eos> I don't care if the president of the United States is calling you.<eos> I catch you on that phone again, you're done.
Lund.<eos> I'm gonna tell you something.<eos> No, you know what, I'm gonna tell you something.<eos> Yeah, I disobeyed a direct order.<eos> But guess what, I don't give a damn.<eos> If becoming an agent means abandoning my team when they need me the most, well, then you can take that badge and you can sh...<eos> Lund!<eos> You did good.<eos> Come again?<eos> Remember what I told you when I chased you up the rope?
There's a federal law called the Mann Act... makes it a felony to transport a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sex.<eos> Susan, it's time you and I had a little chat.<eos> Federal prison's a lot worse than a conversation with me.<eos> I promise.<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> He is more than just a kid.<eos> I know.<eos> I think Jordan... is a Balcony Person.<eos> What?<eos> Well, a Balcony Person is someone who sits in the theater of your life, adoring you, admiring you, cheering you on, and Jordan is that for you.
Sure.<eos> But some people never had it growing up, so they have this insatiable need to fill their balcony as grown-ups.<eos> You haven't talked to your dad in ten years.<eos> - He lives a long way away.<eos> - He's not a bad man, from what I understand.<eos> Is he?<eos> But when he married your stepmother and his focus shifted to her and her children... you felt like he left your balcony, didn't you?<eos> I saw the way you looked at the wall when Dr. Strand started talking about dating down.<eos> You wanted to escape.<eos> 'Cause you know the man you need, the men that you've needed, they have to adore you, put you on a pedestal.

I do.<eos> But this isn't it.<eos> Jordan.<eos> Susan has something she'd like to say.<eos> Jordan...<eos> I... got so caught up trying to run away from my... old life that I didn't fully think it through.<eos> Susan...<eos> No, just-just listen, okay?<eos> I...<eos> I hurt you.
Okay, I got it.<eos> Got it. Aw. Those near-death experiences, they really make you hungry, huh?<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick, we need a sound check. Um...<eos> Hey, uh, Ryan, by the way, happy birthday.<eos> Oh, hey, it's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't remind me.<eos> I am so sorry. I-I...<eos> How's that sound to you, boss?
My dad, he, um... he tried to be all things. He was, uh...<eos> Mr. Discipline one minute, and, uh... the next, he'd... feel bad and baby me, like she used to.<eos> Baby you?<eos> Yeah, he'd bail me out.<eos> He'd shake his head, all pissed off, and then bend over backwards to fix whatever jam I was in.<eos> You know, m-my dad was never anything like that,<eos> Remember Agent Gibbs?<eos> Remember him?<eos> He was here earlier.<eos> Tell you what, he might be the toughest guy I've ever met.
I mean, you can't get away from it.<eos> Okay, well, then you look around it.<eos> You look for the good.<eos> It's out there.<eos> I promise.<eos> I mean, i-if you find meanness, you kill it with kindness.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> You're damn right, here we go.<eos> Open doors for strangers.<eos> You let a car go ahead of you in traffic.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> A sleeping curse?<eos> That's never kept us apart before.<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You've...<eos> You're confused.<eos> You've been in a coma.<eos> The Evil Queen's guards... They stabbed me.<eos> I-I passed out, and then...<eos> The curse must have brought us here, whatever this place is.<eos> I'm gonna go get a doctor.<eos> All right.<eos> Whatever she did to you, I know Snow White is in there somewhere.
But worry not.<eos> I won't force you to do anything.<eos> When you join me, it will be because you want to.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.<eos> Oh, when the darkness comes, you'll change your mind.<eos> And then, Rumplestiltskin, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.<eos> _<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without the scales.
It'll put you back under, and then, when the time is right,<eos> Emma will find us.<eos> That's easy for you to say. You don't have a child who's out there by herself.<eos> You have no idea what's out there for me.<eos> You can't stop us.<eos> You don't have magic in this world.<eos> Here, you're just a man.<eos> I don't need magic to stop you.<eos> You see, this potion... is the only way forward.<eos> I swore I would never leave you alone again, and now the Final Battle is coming.
You wouldn't be fighting the Final Battle now.<eos> I get it. You had to do what was right for everyone else before yourselves.<eos> And today, I'm putting you first.<eos> You have a future, someone you love.<eos> This is your one chance of breaking the curse.<eos> Hook needs it more than we do.<eos> Eventually you'll find a way to wake us.<eos> We took so much from you.<eos> We can't take him, too... not before the Final Battle.<eos> For your crimes against Pan, the Lost Boys sentence you to death.
You did it.<eos> Well, it wouldn't have worked if you hadn't inspired all these people.<eos> You gave up your family for them.<eos> And got a bigger one in return.<eos> That's how I know that we'll defeat the Black Fairy, Emma.<eos> No matter what she does, you will not face her alone.<eos> There's never enough time, is there?<eos> Whether it's fast or slow or even if it doesn't move at all, but especially when the end is near.<eos> You gave my dagger back... Why?<eos> As I told you, you're going to choose to be part of this family.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know what you're really meant to be, Lucy.<eos> Just ask them why they really chose you for this mission.
Would you please stop pretending that you actually care about me?<eos> My entire life, not one phone call, and all of a sudden you're Dad of the Year?<eos> I get it.<eos> Your life is... is crazy and getting crazier.<eos> You're engaged to some doctor you don't know.<eos> You don't even have your sister to talk to, and now I come along.<eos> I am so... so sorry about Amy.<eos> You do not get to say her name.<eos> I know what you are.<eos> What do you know about Rittenhouse besides what Flynn has told you?
You stole a time machine, Wyatt.<eos> We can't exactly throw you in county jail.<eos> Hey.<eos> You think you could, slip me a snorkel before the waterboarding starts?<eos> I am seriously pissed at you, but I put in a call to Sam Dwyer.<eos> He's a JAG defense lawyer, a good one.<eos> I don't want a defense.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> Good luck.<eos> He said something to upset you, didn't he?
I mean, his father was a congressman.<eos> Maybe the love of the spotlight got passed down.<eos> I mean, he had money, adoration, power.<eos> How do you walk away from a family like that?<eos> I just thought he'd make a different choice.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom, I...<eos> I have to go.<eos> I...<eos> Lucy. Hold on.<eos> I know meeting your father has thrown you, and I get it that you don't want to talk to me about it, but what do we do in our family when we go through tough times?
They told some story about how we were all heroes when the truth was Omega was a total train wreck.<eos> You swore on direct that Trevor was writing a book?<eos> He was gonna tell how the Navy lied to cover up the operation.<eos> Is that why you and Jake killed Trevor?<eos> - Objection!<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> Can I please answer that, Your Honor?<eos> Overruled.<eos> Jake and I both agreed that it wasn't right that Trevor was gonna get rich off the backs of our dead brothers and piss all over the code.<eos> After everyone pumps you up and thanks you for your service and tells you what a big hero you are, you're supposed to keep quiet and try to forget what really happened, but Trevor couldn't do that.
Whoever these guns belong to is your shooter.<eos> What's with that guy?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why aren't you dressed?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - I saw your Tumblr page.<eos> - Okay...<eos> You know, I get that exploiting other people for their fame is a thing, but couldn't you have at least asked me first? Whoa, whoa...<eos> Who's exploiting you?
- You okay?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - I saw your Tumblr page.<eos> - Okay...<eos> You know, I get that exploiting other people for their fame is a thing, but couldn't you have at least asked me first? Whoa, whoa...<eos> Who's exploiting you?<eos> You posted stuff that was private.<eos> It was just between us.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Major.<eos> You're basically a hermit because all anyone sees when they look at you is the Chaos Killer.
I'm trying to help you, Major.<eos> You're basically a hermit because all anyone sees when they look at you is the Chaos Killer.<eos> I'm showing them the real Major, the one who is sweet, and smart, and funny, and charming.<eos> And, okay, pretty easy on the eyes.<eos> Don't you think it's time someone told that story?<eos> I don't want to be any story.<eos> I just want to go back to when nobody knew who I was.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> That ship has sailed.<eos> Look, if the posts bother you that much, I'll take them down.
You'd better, because you have to unwrap your present.<eos> And by present, I mean... me.<eos> Will your family miss you at all?<eos> I know I will.<eos> No.<eos> They won't miss me and I certainly won't miss them.<eos> - You won't even call them?<eos> - No.<eos> I'd give anything to hear my father's voice. Yeah.<eos> But... your father didn't dress you up as an elf and make you ring a bell to steal Salvation Army Money.
What cupcake?<eos> I don't want it. I don't want anything.<eos> Okay, Gabi, what's going on?<eos> Why did you run out of Josh's so fast?<eos> You've always loved your birthday.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You're still young.<eos> You're three weeks older than me.<eos> (sighs) Well, let me tell you something.<eos> The big two-five hits you like a ton o' bricks.
- Here's me and Elliot at Caesar's. - Ohh!<eos> - Here's me and Elliot at the MGM Grand!<eos> - Uh-huh. Here's me and Elliot at...<eos> - Huh. - at a chapel?<eos> Here's me and Elliot slippin' rings on each other's fingers.<eos> - Here's me and El... - (both gag)<eos> - Oh my damn!<eos> - Hey, girls!<eos> Ooh, brekkie!<eos> Did Yolanda tell you how much fun we had?
No, we're just gonna netflix.<eos> You know it's Valentine's day, right?<eos> Sorry. Valentine's day's a corporate holiday.<eos> Yeah, it's just like any other day to people who don't buy what big business is cramming down their throats.<eos> Oh, okay. I guess I've just been a lemming all these years.<eos> A lot of people are... don't sweat it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I told Ken not to do anything.<eos> Uh, don't worry. He didn't do anything.<eos> It's funny how your arthritis starts acting up Just when I ask you to julienne the vegetables!
- Is it under you? - Ooh!<eos> This is so much fun!<eos> I never want the scavenger hunt to end.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this isn't the end.<eos> Ken.<eos> There aren't many other places... just do it!<eos> I really am sorry your date left.<eos> Ah, it's nothing a delicious steak can't fix. Mm.<eos> Hey, did damona tell you How we discovered this place?
Agreed.<eos> I want you and Deeks undercover at the retirement home.<eos> Perfect.<eos> And, Ms. Blye?<eos> Yes?<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Mr. Hanna?<eos> Yeah?<eos> A Secret Service agent will meet you in the boatshed.
This is why I became a detective-- to hunt this man.<eos> I'm ready. You're going to die tonight, quite horribly.<eos> You must understand. You will always... be my friend.<eos> - Captain?<eos> - We got him.<eos> The doctor said it was some kind of corrosive.<eos> He's gonna wake up after a few hours, and I'm gonna ask him who did this to him.<eos> I'm gonna have to go after them.<eos> Do you think I did the right thing?<eos> I think you do not have the stain of a murder upon you.
So, that could mean...<eos> One of his shoes was tied for him?<eos> It's just a theory, but it's possible somebody subdued him, took off one of his shoes, injected something between his toes to cause a heart attack, and then put the shoe back on.<eos> The M.E. classified the death as natural, and did not mention any puncture wounds in her report.<eos> Yeah, it's possible she could've missed it, but the only way to know for sure is to exhume the body.<eos> I'll reach out to the captain.<eos> I already did. He said no.<eos> He doesn't think there's enough evidence to even broach the subject with his family.<eos> Well, then we'll find some.<eos> Does Kitty seem a little off to you?
You're going after a man who's financed three murders.<eos> The second you found out I had a baby on board, you would've benched me.<eos> - No.<eos> - "No"?<eos> No, there's more to it than that, I can tell.<eos> After all this is over, after we prove Kotite's guilty, um...<eos> I'm quitting.<eos> Quitting?<eos> Being a detective.<eos> I'm gonna stay on with the group I told you about, but strictly as a counselor.
I get that, okay?<eos> It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've got so much to feel good about.<eos> You've got a great job now.<eos> Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.<eos> You make more than I do.<eos> You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.<eos> It's bigger than mine.<eos> And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
There you go.<eos> [Titus] Throw the key out the bathroom window so I can take it to the hardware store.<eos> I'll run like the wind.<eos> [Kimmy] I know you won't.<eos> [Titus] The wind can be slow, Kimmy.<eos> [Titus] Wait until you hear my signal.<eos> Buh-bird!<eos> Bird! Buh-buh-buh-bird!<eos> Head back to the counter.<eos> My associate will return the original key to you.
So just change the lock.<eos> Then this will all be over!<eos> And let the son of a bitch get away with it?<eos> Nah.<eos> Whoever did this... is goin' on the wall.<eos> Here.<eos> Kimmy, you're a good kid.<eos> I don't even pick the cashews out of nut mixes.<eos> You just made a mistake.<eos> But don't let this sick bastard do to you what he did to Sharon.
It's because he made people mad, and nothing motivates Americans like outrage.<eos> Just look at the election.<eos> -The emails.<eos> -No stamina.<eos> Her hair!<eos> Well, downstairs, a group of very angry Native Americans are burning Redskins jerseys at $250 a pop.<eos> So?<eos> It's just more money for me.<eos> [Jacqueline] Exactly.<eos> You're making money off of people that hate you.
I'd suggest Luke 21:36.<eos> "Pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things."<eos> What do you think is in there?<eos> What's say you open it up, stick your head in, and take a gander?<eos> Charliehorse, we're under attack!<eos> You've murdered my friends and colleagues.<eos> You blackmailed a man I hold in the highest esteem.<eos> You seem to have a comprehensive knowledge of my life that you could only realize through an association with someone close to me.<eos> You don't recognize me, do you?<eos> I want to know who hired you.
We're right here with you. We're not going anywhere.<eos> There's a man I know who works as a docent in a small museum in the Northwest.<eos> He recently remarried.<eos> Rotary Tuesdays.<eos> Euchre Fridays.<eos> A modest but happy life.<eos> Gavin and I played Euchre.<eos> Before you killed him.<eos> Gavin was a brilliant accountant.<eos> And an even better man... who worshiped you.
Maybe you do. How...<eos> How would I know? I'm...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think I see an old friend.<eos> Excuse me. Um...<eos> Aren't you supposed to be in jail?<eos> - Now's not a good time.<eos> - Really? I'm sorry.<eos> Am...<eos> Am I inconveniencing you?
They're in custody.<eos> I told you you would be amazing.<eos> You don't have to say that.<eos> It's true.<eos> I killed a man today.<eos> And by killing him, I prevented us from interrogating him. From getting information on his other cases and clients, victims.<eos> Aram, you did the right thing.<eos> She's the reason we were able to find you.<eos> Hey, Janet...<eos> I'm probably only alive because of you, so... thank you for that.
Harold, it troubles me that you're dissatisfied with the results of our efforts.<eos> Doing good for selfish reasons doesn't make you good.<eos> It just makes you good at being selfish.<eos> I'm sorry about your daughter.<eos> You've never spoken of her around me, which of course I understand, but... you've seemed... anxious of late.<eos> When someone you love is sick, you don't need to shoulder that burden alone.<eos> My daughter isn't a burden.<eos> She's my greatest blessing.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but she's none of your business.<eos> You want to know why those closest to you betray you?
So do I.<eos> Neither of these staffers killed Whitfield.<eos> What's our next move?<eos> This murder is looking like a power play by Aiken to become governor.<eos> I think we have no choice but to put governor Aiken on the stand.<eos> Why didn't you tell Rick you broke up with Gabe?<eos> Why does it matter?<eos> Because you like him and you're single.<eos> When did I say I liked him?<eos> You told me he asked you about Gabe. So?
There goes his shot at president.<eos> Do you think this is a game?<eos> Maybe it's best if we don't interact until after the trial, Liberty.<eos> Exposing an irrelevant affair?<eos> You couldn't win this case on the facts, so you had to play dirty?<eos> I'm on the right side of this one, Liberty.<eos> You know, you always have to be in control, don't you?<eos> That's not why I took this case.<eos> You saw me on a big case, national news, and you had nothing to do with it.<eos> I didn't call you for help, so you ran to the other side.
What, you thought I was gonna ask you out or something?<eos> Would you have asked me out?<eos> I guess we'll never know now.<eos> So you want to grab a drink?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> Remember the guy I told you I prosecuted?
I don't want to, but what choice do I have?<eos> I can't trust you to stay if you're not sedated.<eos> You might try and run off again.<eos> We're not there yet, but we will be.<eos> I know we will.<eos> It's gonna happen.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who put you in there?
Aram, I sent you a video.<eos> The lead on panetti didn't pan out.<eos> Yeah, we've got nothing.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Helen dahle's husband said he had to get away to clear his head, and think about his wife's future.<eos> Well, Robert dahle did go to sarasota Springs, and he did stay in the hotel he mentioned, but he did not stay alone.<eos> Dahle was cheating on his wife.<eos> Are you saying that the husband hired the apothecary to kill his wife?<eos> I'm just saying he definitely had a motive.<eos> When did I meet you?
Says the man with the gun.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> Lou Lou mclellan.<eos> Hey, hey, can you be careful with that thing?<eos> Was I alone last night? Or was I accompanied by anybody?<eos> My associate...<eos> Dembe.<eos> No...<eos> What is wrong with you?
They're two weeks shy of their 10-year anniversary.<eos> So, that's either a really, really bad coincidence, or...<eos> Or Helen found out about the mistress, and Robert put her in the penalty box so she couldn't divorce him before the prenup expired.<eos> What's the payout after 10 years? Close to $15 million.<eos> I think we should bring this guy in and take a run at him.<eos> Take a shot at the girlfriend first.<eos> Let's see just how much she really loves this guy.<eos> So, are the police on their way?<eos> Who's Elizabeth?<eos> After I got some of those pills in you, you came to.
You said you had levine follow the money.<eos> The funds came from one of your own accounts.<eos> The 11 people to whom I extended invitations tonight were the only ones who could've accessed that particular account.<eos> One of those 11 is a traitor... And only 10 of you are here.<eos> Perhaps our Judas didn't have the nerve to attend this last supper.<eos> Well, I can assure you I will find the guilty party, and he or she will be held accountable.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You sent the chef and his staff home, you took our phones, you locked us in the kitchen.<eos> Well, I'd prefer something stronger, but this'll do for the moment.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Scotch.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you drink scotch?<eos> I did.<eos> But there were only two people who had access to the bottle, and I'm one of 'em.<eos> Who was the other?<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> Raymond, are you okay?<eos> Reddington, talk to me.<eos> Who poisoned you?
Sorry I'm late.<eos> My waxing ran a little long.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, man, I remember those days.<eos> Yeah, but, you know, after you have a baby, it's better to kind of keep something down there. Oh.<eos> Some parties are just better under a tent.<eos> Well, my lady is amazing.<eos> I let her do my whole body... attic, basement and panic room.<eos> Panic room.<eos> You know, you should go to her and say that Colleen referred you.
I let her do my whole body... attic, basement and panic room.<eos> Panic room.<eos> You know, you should go to her and say that Colleen referred you.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> - No, come on!<eos> You'll be like a brand-new lady.<eos> Getting into bed will be like a penguin sliding down a glacier.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> - What the heck? I'll give it a try.<eos> - Yay! Remember, say Colleen sent you.
You're supposed to love and protect your children.<eos> How could you do this to your child?<eos> Gypsy Rose Blanchard was as consistently.<eos> And viciously subjected to, in my opinion, Munchausen by proxy as anyone I've come across.<eos> Munchausen by proxy involves a caregiver who either feigns or actually induces illness in her children.<eos> And her goal is some kind of emotional gratification... Looking for sympathy, attention, care, concern that she feels unable to get in any other way.<eos> It is a form of child abuse, first and foremost.<eos> The earliest surgery that I can remember probably would be having my feeding tube put in.<eos> You have to have it constantly changed, like every six months.<eos> And that would be pretty painful, because they don't put you under anesthesia, they just take you in the emergency room, rip the old one out, and put a new one in.
- Okay.<eos> Did your mouth touch anywhere on Dee Dee's body? - My mouth?<eos> No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You didn't kiss her or... - Nope.<eos> - ...<eos> lick her or anything like that? - Nope.<eos> What do you think about people that have sex with dead bodies?<eos> I mean, it's quite disturbing, honestly.<eos> Okay, that's... That would bother you? Yeah.
Watch that girl.<eos> Don't turn your back. You she might stab you.<eos> I do think Gypsy is potentially dangerous.<eos> Dee Dee was a master manipulator, and it's impossible that Gypsy would not have picked this up and used it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know?<eos> I mean, that's the way it works, though, when you have what he has.<eos> Your mind focuses on one thing. Do you know what I mean?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Do you think that if Gypsy hadn't asked you to kill her mom, you'd have ever killed her mom?
She was punished enough to where they should let her go free. That's the way I feel.<eos> 'Cause that child's... She's been through a lot.<eos> Look at her.<eos> - Is that Gypsy?<eos> - Yeah, when she was normal.<eos> I blame myself now for not doing more. I mean, it is what it is.<eos> I'm not a "blame yourself" type of guy, but who else is there to look at, you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> This is... sorry.<eos> I didn't realize they were going to bring you out immediately.
Don't blame yourself, sweetie.<eos> We blame... I hold enough for myself, you know?<eos> Accountability, it's... But, I mean, we're not gonna dwell on that.<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> We're gonna go forward, and when you get out..<eos> - We'll heal together.<eos> - ...you're still gonna be young.<eos> We can have a great relationship.<eos> Look, God pulled you through it.
- you are now on Facebook.<eos> - (chuckles) I don't feel any different.<eos> You will, because now you'll be able to see pictures of Lark the day that we take 'em.<eos> Yeah, instead of telling us to print them out every week, which is fun.<eos> Well, we tried loading 'em on the digital, uh, picture frame there, but it's still showing the kid it came with.<eos> GREG: So that explains why your friends are always confused when they meet Lark.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so, first, all you need to do is enter your hometown.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That's how they find you and then that's how they steal your identity.
Man, if those tattoos could talk.<eos> They'd ask to put their clothes back on.<eos> All right, I know what you want.<eos> I was just gonna warm you up with the roadie, but I can see you want the real deal.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> Dr. Dad knows just where all the dressing rooms are.<eos> Excuse me, Roadie, - where are the dressing rooms?<eos> - Watch your feet.<eos> Probably couldn't hear 'cause hearing loss, you know.<eos> Touring. Probably couldn't hear you over that jacket.
Reid: "To go against conscience is neither right nor safe.<eos> Here I stand.<eos> I can do no other.<eos> Martin Luther.<eos> huh?<eos> quiet in there!<eos> Hmm?<eos> It's not my first time in a prison.<eos> I can handle it. Sorry.<eos> I don't want them looking at you.
Shut down their entire leadership.<eos> Including Damon's father, Derek Yang.<eos> What's the connection between Damon and Ethan Beck?<eos> There doesn't seem to be one.<eos> Except for the fact that he specializes in cyber crimes, identity theft, credit card fraud.<eos> He was prodigious.<eos> And look at his neck tat.<eos> 438.<eos> Triads use numeric codes to distinguish their ranks.<eos> Mean something to you?
If an orange and a cashew can work together in a salad, why can't different kinds of people work together in the world?<eos> I made her.<eos> Now, you're probably wondering,<eos> "Why a salad?<eos> Why not soup?"<eos> And to that I say, don't get hung up on the metaphor.<eos> I could do this whole thing all over again with soup.<eos> You keep coming back, June.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Remember what I told you.
I'm in way over my head.<eos> No problem.<eos> Little problem.<eos> We were in the middle of a romantic dinner.<eos> Victor, please.<eos> I already took the pill, now it's wasted.<eos> Hi, girls.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Bad. Really bad.<eos> I begged you not to answer your phone.
Marjorie has the most awesome hands.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Let me see!<eos> You all right?<eos> Been better.<eos> Sure different than it used to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did like you teaching me how to skip.<eos> I liked it, too.<eos> I'm sorry I blamed you for what happened.
One, two, three, go.<eos> Get off me!<eos> I hope you rot in hell.<eos> Little help, Rog?<eos> Get off me!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> She ruined my life.<eos> I spent a year in jail 'cause of her.<eos> You want to act like an animal?<eos> Then I will treat you like an animal.
Was one hell of a shot, Rog.<eos> No hesitation.<eos> Nope.<eos> Shot him right through the hand.<eos> Sure did.<eos> Were you aiming for his hand, Rog?<eos> Shot him right through the hand.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> Nice try.<eos> Just because you saved my life does not entitle you to read my files.
Help! Help!<eos> Hey, you ok?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm... I'm fine.<eos> Well, you don't seem fine.<eos> Look... Really, really, really, I'm ok.<eos> Just go away, please?<eos> I know I may not be the someone you want to talk to, but I can't walk away with you like this.
Hello, Susan.<eos> You're looking much better.<eos> Colour in your cheeks.<eos> See what I brought you?
! - Stop!<eos> What do you mean, "don't worry about it"?<eos> Look at this!<eos> Look! - What?<eos> - Rachel bloody vivisecting her!<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Kira.<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did she do to you?
She did shed some light on those many sisters<eos> - of yours. - She did not.<eos> Clones, Jesus Christ, what a trip!<eos> She had no right to do that, Adele.<eos> Hey, you know what? She trusted me.<eos> I'm kind of a sucker for that.<eos> You could have too, - you know.<eos> - Adele, there was a reason<eos> I didn't tell you: oh yeah, our life is hell and our people regularly die violently.<eos> Alright. Well, did I ever tell you why I was disbarred?
How things must have changed while she kept me in here drooling on myself.<eos> Who?<eos> Get me out. Then we'll talk.<eos> You don't get to decide.<eos> You're gonna talk now!<eos> - Sarah, stay with me.<eos> - Everything alright?<eos> - Thank you. Just clumsy.<eos> You want to get out of here, you need to earn it.<eos> Now, who put you in here?
- I'm a guest of Dr. Nimitz.<eos> - Yes, I'm Dr. Nimitz. Oh!<eos> Well, finally!<eos> So lovely to...<eos> - This is Gabrielle...<eos> - Keri!<eos> Ms. Ripley's line is out.<eos> There seems to have been some... confusion...<eos> Yeah, can you two come with me?<eos> KILL YOU!
Helena, too, soon.<eos> So, should we get to it, then?<eos> Yes. Rachel, meet me in my office after your examination.<eos> My examination?<eos> An endometrial biopsy to test the efficacy of the inoculation.<eos> We'll have the results tomorrow.<eos> Virginia wants to cure the remaining Ledas as much as you do.<eos> I'll give you a moment to change.<eos> You are no longer 779H41 or Neolution property.<eos> This document legally emancipates you.
Oh, my God, Rachel.<eos> You killed her.<eos> While you were sitting on your hands waiting for her to die naturally when we need a cure.<eos> I won't be shut out of my medical file.<eos> It's my body.<eos> Her name is Miriam Johnson.<eos> She was creative, a musician.<eos> She was homeless, and the mother you put her with was a drunk.<eos> You raised me to be objective.<eos> Neolution raised you, here, in a corporation.
I love you more than anything, and I've never been so proud of you.<eos> Rachel is Elephant and Wonderland's the island.<eos> They're taking Kira to the island?<eos> Coady's there.<eos> Mr. Westmorland.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Rachel.<eos> I'm just checking in to make sure that you're all right.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Well, I've asked you to do something that you don't want to do.
Is she lying?<eos> You're forgiven.<eos> You're ready?<eos> Full financial records of Neolution's dark money bribes.<eos> It's all going public.<eos> Helena!<eos> You devil!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> The mother who left you knew you had the devil inside.
There are too many people looking for us.<eos> - What about Gracie?<eos> - Be patient, Mark.<eos> After the birth, she'll join us.<eos> Until then, I need you on security.<eos> - Mark...<eos> - Relax, Helena.<eos> Mark...<eos> Mark...<eos> My dear child, so this is where I finally find you.
I'm with Kira and she said Helena is in trouble.<eos> I can feel her.<eos> Her babies are coming.<eos> Well, I see only two options for you.<eos> Either, we hand you over to John, or we hand you over to the authorities.<eos> Third option, I pull the trigger for the second time today.<eos> I don't know, please, all I know is the person with the biggest target on her back, is her.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Yes.<eos> If he wants you so bad, I say we give you up.
- Have we?<eos> - Well, it's settled.<eos> We're gonna take the day off from crazy.<eos> Thank you for letting me stay.<eos> I don't have a family anymore; I didn't know where else to go.<eos> What?<eos> When did Mark die?<eos> Two weeks ago.<eos> How did you find me again?<eos> Well, you told me about Sister Irena, how she... fed you when the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the New World after they cut out her tongue.

- Keep an eye out for S, yeah?<eos> Hey.<eos> Clean floor.<eos> Gracie,it'sme .<eos> We need to know if you found her yet. Call me back.<eos> Please.<eos> Mark is sick.<eos> - Coady said she could help, but...<eos> - Coady? ! - We are family!<eos> - I know. I knew it when I saw you, which is why I told him I couldn't find you. - Didn't tell them where you are.
It's just gonna be us and the open ocean, all alone, and I'm gonna overwhelm her with so much romance, she'll forget why she keeps saying "No, no, no,"<eos> and she'll finally say "Yes!<eos> I'm sorry, it's just so romantic.<eos> Danny... you're gonna get married without me?<eos> But... you're my first born, my baby.<eos> You were there at my first wedding, I should be there at yours.<eos> Well, you just can't be.<eos> And I need you to be happy for me, Mom.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Oh, sweetie, I love you, too.
He's actually quite small for a boxer.<eos> So... when are you gonna see her again?<eos> Annabelle?<eos> How about never?<eos> Well, what if you guys really do have a connection?<eos> I mean, she's got boobs and a pulse, so yeah, we've got a connection, but not a call-off-your-wedding kinda connection.<eos> Who does that? You!<eos> You would do that!<eos> Let's just say I actually believed in your... your stupid, she's-the-one soul mate nonsense, okay?<eos> Maybe this whole Elle business was just the universe telling you that there really is someone out there for you, and maybe that someone is Annabelle.
We all got issues.<eos> If Jane did get this call, why didn't she do anything?<eos> I mean, call the cops, hand someone a note.<eos> - I don't know, send a text.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Because the guy who had her kid said not to.<eos> When that dirt bag took Diego, I couldn't think straight.<eos> All that mattered was getting him back.<eos> You don't ask why. You don't ask questions.<eos> You just do what they tell you to.
Corina: I love this place.<eos> I know you don't like him. But Mr. Reddington, he takes good care of his people.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to go to the tables.<eos> But I'm basking. And I'm dying to bask in that beautiful bathtub.<eos> Bask away, but hurry.<eos> Hmm. I need my good luck charm.<eos> Please don't shoot.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm not gonna shoot you.<eos> The gun is just to make sure you stay quiet while Charlotte strangles you.
No, no, no, I just need like two seconds to go meet her.<eos> Well, ten minutes tops.<eos> So you want to leave me to meet some other girl?<eos> She isn't just a girl... a girl I saw three times in one day.<eos> It's like crazy fate.<eos> Well, you're about to see me no times in no days if you don't just sit down.<eos> No, I can't. I'm sorry. Sam, I got to go.<eos> This might be a bad time, but can you watch Emma for just two sec... okay.<eos> Elle, it's me!<eos> Did Ben leave you here with Emma?
Titus, look for it.<eos> Help me look for it.<eos> Okay? It has to be here.<eos> -Seven minutes in heaven. -[laughs]<eos> When was the last time you played this?<eos> Nineteen eighty-nine, but Bill Cosby didn't know I'd switched the soups.<eos> [Artie] To be honest, I don't do a lot of cardio anymore.<eos> I'm kind of relieved that the power's out.<eos> Come here.<eos> [Dionne Warwick speaking indistinctly] [both laughing] The lights work for you.
-Aaayyy. -We did stuff.<eos> Heh, heh, heh. So there was no fire, was there?<eos> Was everything you told us a lie?<eos> No! I was the lead in Mahogany.<eos> But then...<eos> Dionne Warwick got better.<eos> Oh, Miss Dionne.<eos> You're up.<eos> Yes, baby Ti-ti.<eos> Oh, and God bless you for understudying me.
And I was imprisoned for 15 years by a lunatic!<eos> -What?<eos> -Later.<eos> Fudge this.<eos> Fudge this whole thing raw!<eos> You know what, Titus?<eos> I meant it when I said I only wanted good people in my bunker.<eos> You mean "funker."<eos> I don't anymore.<eos> And even with all the extra chances I've given you, I'm not sure you're a good person.
Not the pizza boxes! I'm saving those to make soup.<eos> [sighs] -What are you doing?<eos> -Finally getting my man cave back.<eos> Give me a break. You never used this room.<eos> Because it was haunted by the ghost of that water bug you killed.<eos> That was just a different water bug who got trapped in a Kleenex.<eos> Throw these away, though, right?<eos> -Those are prescription!<eos> -[Artie] Smart.<eos> Frames is where they get you.

We screamed at each other two to three hours a day, and you never had a nice boyfriend, and you never had a good job, and people thought you were autistic 'cause you wore those New Year's glasses everywhere.<eos> I chose to hear "artistic."<eos> If Kimmy was here right now, she would tell you to beg Kimmy to come back.
What are we doing?<eos> I just need to pull myself together.<eos> Oh, Lord, which one is his building?<eos> Oh, the sexy one with the wheelchair ramp.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How am I ever gonna get over this?<eos> Bonnie,<eos> I've loved and lost, and... it taught me an important life lesson.<eos> It's gonna take you five penises to get over this guy.<eos> First three are sacrificial, the fourth one gets you through the holidays, and number five gets you all the way to "Adam who?"
- Yep, completely alone.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm glad we can joke about it.<eos> We are joking about it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> Oh, it's Christy.<eos> She wants to know how it's going, with ten question marks and praying hands.<eos> And I guarantee you the next three dings are gonna be Marjorie, Wendy, and Jill with the same question.<eos> Are your friends bugging you?
CMFB's.<eos> Club for my Friend's Band.<eos> We emulate what a real club feels like to really boost the self-esteem of your friend's band.<eos> We've created a space that looks crowded all the time from the stage.<eos> Flats that move back and forth that look like a crowd.<eos> Lots of lights, smoke.<eos> Can we dim the lights?<eos> Sorry. The band can hardly see. But they feel a really excited crowd.<eos> Give it up, everybody, for Jake on the bass.<eos> We've got secret hiding coves where you can have a conversation and the band can't see you.
I'm not- - I'm not sure what's happening now.<eos> - I just gave him a raise. - Yeah, you did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I failed.<eos> I know, I wanted to stop you. It was really tough.<eos> - You're so convincing. - He's really good.<eos> And I'm such a sucker for content.<eos> Fred, here he is.<eos> Wait, wait, slow down. Don't be too enthusiastic, you know what I mean?<eos> You could be pleasant, but they're rating you - as soon they see you. - Okay.
You look good.<eos> You know the destination, so make your way any way that you see fit.<eos> Your eyes are on the road.<eos> You're not even using your GPS, are you?<eos> You're not.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Hey, man, you thirsty?<eos> Have a bottle of water here in my pocket.<eos> That's a gift for you.<eos> See, that's the shirt I was telling you about, Carrie, the one I wanted to get that is, like, really expensive looking and makes everyone look really handsome.
I know. I know.<eos> Listen, I was thinking of... going out to dinner tomorrow night and buying, like, an $800 bottle of wine.<eos> So, I guess you'll have to join me.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> You know I'll be there, Sandy.<eos> I'm, um, I'm really glad we did this.<eos> Me too.<eos> That was a lot of fun.<eos> - Oh, Sandra, you know what, my shift is ending.<eos> I'm gonna turn you over to my associate.
Okay, get in.<eos> Into the honey, honey.<eos> Okay, we're set.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Sly, we cured the hives with hives, now it's your turn-o to start an inferno. Affirmative!<eos> Nearly done in here.<eos> Final results are in. Want me to check 'em, kid?<eos> We both know the results.<eos> What we're doing now is much more important than some dumb election.<eos> West Altadenia doesn't deserve you, kid.
If it wasn't for him, we might not even be getting married, so suck it up and let's do this.<eos> Man's a doctor like Crunch is a captain.<eos> His Alma matter has "dot com" in the name. Tobias, what matters here is not matriculation.<eos> What matters here is ramification, i.e. the outcome.<eos> Yes. But all that comes out of your mouth is B.S.<eos> That's your inner child talking, and he's rude.<eos> Now you both filled out my pre-session questionnaire.<eos> Though Tobias's seemed to be mostly creative suggestions for where I could shove my paperwork.<eos> Miss Quinn, on the other hand, took my assignment seriously.<eos> Seems your challenging childhood may have left you a little...
I honestly think she's wonderful.<eos> Let's test that hypothesis.<eos> What's that?<eos> I call it the Bicker Clicker.<eos> Patent pending.<eos> How does it work?<eos> Every time you say or do something that should cause you two to bicker, he hits the clicker. It keeps count.<eos> We get back together, review the numbers, see where we are.<eos> We're gonna be at zero, because everything she does delights me.<eos> Let me ask you something, how do you feel about Happy dragging you here to see me?
Share it.<eos> Thanks for nothing, quack!<eos> We're worse off than before we came here.<eos> Wow, 32 clicks!<eos> That's a new record!<eos> Not 32. It hit 99 and then turned over.<eos> It's 131 clicks.<eos> Really great work, Cecil.<eos> All you proven is that the woman I'm gonna marry drives me crazy.<eos> Tobias, you already knew she was driving you crazy.
I know he's a criminal.<eos> He was a criminal.<eos> And now he's just cured?<eos> He's ready to be a father to Chivonne?<eos> Look, before you talk to her, I think...<eos> I'm not going to talk to her.<eos> I want her in my life, I have to earn it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You can relax now.<eos> I promise no one followed you and no one's watching you.
I know you?<eos> I'm your...<eos> I'm Shinwell.<eos> You said you want to talk?<eos> It's okay, guys.<eos> Catch you later.<eos> You don't look like I remember.<eos> You, neither.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I texted you this morning; I said I'll meet you after school.
Doesn't matter that she don't like him.<eos> It don't matter that she just 14.<eos> One way or another, he gonna get what he wants.<eos> Now, this boy, Lucien, he keep coming at her, got his boys following her, just making her life hell.<eos> Did she talk to the police?<eos> You mean did she snitch?<eos> No.<eos> She worried that it's gonna come back on her and her aunt, and it would.<eos> That's why she came to me.<eos> What did she ask you to do?
Not unless you could make Tendu go away.<eos> Which brings us to your fixer, Kurt Godwyn.<eos> No, no, you see...<eos> Save it.<eos> We've already got a full confession from Mr. Godwyn.<eos> You might want to call your firm.<eos> You're gonna need a good lawyer.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wanted you to know that boy Lucien won't be bothering you no more.
He needed some air, so he went over to open the window and it was all blacked out.<eos> But then it starts moving.<eos> Like wiggling.<eos> The glass was covered in flies.<eos> I mean, they were pretty much the dead lady, since her body was all maggots, right?<eos> One dead lady made 100,000 flies.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> Hey, the guy who came to see you, was that Rossi, the one you play chess with?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He showed you how to castle strategically?
We needed each other.<eos> If it weren't for him, I don't know what would have happened.<eos> So you believe in fate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You believe in it, right?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But think about it.<eos> If... if you hadn't've lost your phone, then maybe you would have gone out with your friends like you planned.<eos> Instead, you went to your dad's and I saw you.
That necklace has been in my family for generations.<eos> - Damn it, Chip, - My mother had...<eos> Everyone, calm down!<eos> I'll explain what happened.<eos> What happened is that you got played just exactly like I told you you were going to.<eos> - I feel so stupid. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know why?<eos> 'Cause you are stupid.<eos> Here I am, spewing information, life skills all over you.
Nobody cares that you keep a diary. - It's a journal.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Everybody used to fear and respect me.<eos> Now they think I'm some sad sack of emotion.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Hey, don't say that.<eos> I'm sure they still fear you.
Yeah, I... Mm.<eos> Well, yeah, I guess I could do that. Oh, you guess?<eos> Not good enough.<eos> Let me hear you say it.<eos> Fine, I'll tear her ass to pieces.<eos> - Happy?<eos> - Happy? !<eos> No, I'm not happy.<eos> 'Cause that sounded like you wanted to go over there and tickle her ass a little bit, but that's not gonna do the trick.<eos> This girl humiliated you.
I just want us to be friends again.<eos> Here's your journal.<eos> That's okay, Zoe.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I had a lot of time to think in there, and I'm not mad at you.<eos> - You're not?<eos> - No. Oh, my...<eos> Of course not.<eos> It would be such a silly waste of time for someone like me to be mad at someone as insignificant as you.<eos> The truth is... I pity you.
Okay, look alive, everybody.<eos> New shooter, hot dice.<eos> Sabrina?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> F... Ha!<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was just, you kn...<eos> Why are you tied to a leash?<eos> Sabrina tied me up so I couldn't get into any trouble while she's out shopping.<eos> She tied you up like a dog and I'm the one that's unfit to be in charge? Mm-mm.
Well, on behalf of the casino, we'd love to comp you a room, express our gratitude for playing with us today.<eos> That is very nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, we really must be going. What?<eos> What are you...<eos> You turn down a free room?<eos> Well...<eos> Wow. Wow, Alba.<eos> Having money has really changed you.
- Oh, okay.<eos> Poodle.<eos> What about the police?<eos> They're expecting a gunshot victim.<eos> And we're gonna give 'em one.<eos> So, are you gonna do this, or what?<eos> Yeah, I just... I... It's hard to shoot a man in the back.<eos> I've been taught better than that.<eos> Mickey?<eos> This man... - hit you. Whoa!
I know.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here. Hey, shh!<eos> - Oh, Mick.<eos> - I know.<eos> Listen, pay attention.<eos> Chris and Poodle are home, okay?<eos> The cops are on their way, and they're expecting a gunshot victim.<eos> So you shot me in the ass?<eos> ! Yeah, yeah, listen, 'cause you're gonna tell them - that Chip shot you by accident.
Why? !<eos> I mean, I know why.<eos> But why?<eos> Because I want to.<eos> I thought you were a feminist.<eos> You can be a feminist and also be sexy.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can appreciate that you're young and stupid. I really can.<eos> But let me take you to school for a second.
Um, excuse me, miss.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, here's the thing.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> 'Cause you must be wondering...<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Mickey?<eos> What the hell happened to you? Nothing.
Well, thanks for spending it with us, Chip.<eos> It was a pleasure serving you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Can I help you with a ride home?<eos> You guys do that?<eos> I'll call a car service.<eos> I frickin' love sports.<eos> All right, huh?<eos> Thank you for your service.<eos> Never check you on the way out.
Where are you?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I have to go. Hey, I'm talking to you! - I haven't got time.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Stop it, right now!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Hassling me won't help.<eos> You're poking around in things you don't understand.<eos> And I can never tell you what you want to hear!<eos> I wish Mum never met you.
That's a deal, then.<eos> And all of this is yours, to use as you please.<eos> What good will that do me, sitting here without Teo?<eos> I don't know what will do any good!<eos> I know that Teo would have wanted...<eos> He isn't dead.<eos> So don't talk like he is!<eos> You know what Teo's biggest problem was?<eos> - No. - You.<eos> Without you, none of this would have happened.
Yes? It's all very well that she's on her feet again.<eos> But I've got patients lined up for the next 2 weeks.<eos> Damn it, Leif!<eos> You can't bring people in here now.<eos> What do I tell them? These people never had access to proper help before.<eos> I can't tell them the doctor is out because his home life has improved.<eos> The clinic is in a vulnerable phase!<eos> People could quickly lose faith in it.<eos> I get that.<eos> - I just... - How much did I help you?
- Oh, my god!<eos> - We did it!<eos> I can't believe we did it!<eos> Oh, no, we did it.<eos> It's over.<eos> - Yes, I agree.<eos> Up, down, separation.<eos> - Separation.<eos> - Oh, girl, you look so sad.<eos> You know what would cheer you up?
The precinct will not be shut down.<eos> - They decided to shut down the seven-four instead.<eos> - Wait, I don't understand.<eos> - Apparently the community came to our aid.<eos> There was a swell of online support orchestrated by an organization called "Gina-zone."<eos> - I think you mean Ginazon.<eos> I was behind the bar the whole time.<eos> Another great Gina Linetti entrance.<eos> - I told you, you can't be back here.<eos> - And I told you, I already am.
Gideon and I have calculated another Aberration - in Bhopal, 1912.<eos> - Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?<eos> We are history's last line of defense.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> Have you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The Spear could alter reality itself.<eos> Changes to history cause timequakes and Aberrations, which we can undo.<eos> Changes to reality, those are permanent.<eos> You're on the run 'cause you're a time remnant.<eos> Now something's chasing you, trying to correct the Aberration.
- Negative.<eos> It appears to be a desk lamp.<eos> Right.<eos> Engage our cloak and plot a course.<eos> - Heading, Captain?<eos> - The nearest open window.<eos> Any luck?<eos> You asked me that five minutes ago.<eos> You know, it's not easy trying to get a 21st century radio to communicate with a 22nd century time ship.<eos> Thawne never told you what he did with Rip?
What's a goonie?<eos> All right, Malcolm is back in 2016, where he belongs.<eos> - In prison?<eos> - No. His crappy apartment.<eos> And what are your plans for the two of us?<eos> We're dead in 2017, remember?<eos> I'm not taking you back to 2017.<eos> Should've done this in France, Mick.<eos> Could've saved us both a lot of time.<eos> I didn't bring you here to kill you, Leonard.
- In prison?<eos> - No. His crappy apartment.<eos> And what are your plans for the two of us?<eos> We're dead in 2017, remember?<eos> I'm not taking you back to 2017.<eos> Should've done this in France, Mick.<eos> Could've saved us both a lot of time.<eos> I didn't bring you here to kill you, Leonard.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> This is where Thawne recruited you for the Legion.

I've already made that choice.<eos> I'm okay with it.<eos> And so is Laurel.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> Hey, Gideon said we're going back to 1942.<eos> The mission's over.<eos> The Legion's been put back in their proper places in the timeline, so... now it's my turn.<eos> Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to get off<eos> - at that stop with you.<eos> - What? Look, I lost you once already, even though it was a different me and a different you.
The other kids haven't.<eos> Boy, I'm just letting people down<eos> - left and right these days.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. How'd it go?<eos> Did you know they have an actual drive-in movie theater in Springfield, along Route 66?<eos> And the fire department? They're trying to build something good there.<eos> It's a decent offer.<eos> Okay, look, Kelly, you barely know this woman.<eos> I told you it's not all about her.
See the Justice of the Peace.<eos> Even if it's uncomfortable after, like, just because they're, like, you know...<eos> - Yeah. - They'll expect one thing.<eos> - It means you should take stock.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm looking for the owner.<eos> Found him.<eos> No, a different guy?<eos> Told you I was gonna pay you back.
Rosie!<eos> You found her.<eos> You found my Rosie!<eos> How did you... how did you find her?<eos> Well, I didn't do anything.<eos> She found you.<eos> Jupiter took-took-took my dog, and then he never... never came back... never, never.<eos> Well, shame on Jupiter, then?<eos> "Jupiter wanted to go to the home," the man asked.<eos> Okay, well, we're gonna get you out of here now, Marvin, get you some help.
Good morning, everyone.<eos> Dr. Bull.<eos> Judge.<eos> Before we get started, I want to disclose that I keep some of my money in Brannigan Trust... I don't think it's a conflict.<eos> But in the interest of fairness,<eos> I'll entertain argument.<eos> - We need a new judge. - Leave it.<eos> He gave you the stink eye;<eos> That is not a good sign.<eos> If you ask him to recuse himself, he'll turn you down, and then he'll hold it against you - for the rest of the trial.
- Hello?<eos> - Jiya, it's me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Rufus, what...<eos> Did you slip me a burner?<eos> Yeah. I got it from watching "The Wire." Listen...<eos> - Okay, where are you?<eos> - I don't have a lot of time, right now... you are in a lot of trouble.<eos> Whatever you did shut down the network.<eos> Mason's pissed. He's gonna get it up and running again, and then he's going to find you.
- I don't have a lot of time, right now... you are in a lot of trouble.<eos> Whatever you did shut down the network.<eos> Mason's pissed. He's gonna get it up and running again, and then he's going to find you.<eos> That's why I'm going to need you to run interference.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to do that?<eos> Delay.<eos> Distract. Do whatever you can to keep them off of our backs as long as you can.<eos> Rufus, these guys are everywhere.<eos> Jiya, we can't let them have the time machine, all right?<eos> I'm so sorry for putting you on the spot.
Play ball.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> You know, my first day on the job, I was so scared, intimidated.<eos> I... I was in awe of you.<eos> I mean, I was coming to work for the Connor Mason.<eos> I mean, my... my hero.<eos> All I wanted to do was to make you proud.<eos> Right now, it's like that moment where... where Dorothy pulls back the curtain, and she sees the Wizard for who he truly is:<eos> A coward.<eos> Do you really think that this, um, childish, plucky snark is going to help you?
Looks like you finally hit puberty?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who the hell am I?<eos> I'm the one that broke your nose over Shelly Russo.<eos> Jimmy, is that you?<eos> We figured you were dead.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're friends of mine.<eos> Al's gonna be over the moon when he sees you.
But he's just kind of a screw up, you know?<eos> See, I'm the good son.<eos> It's a whole siblings' dynamic thing.<eos> And I'm guessing you're also the stupid son 'cause... you're standing in a patch of poison ivy.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't get the confession.<eos> We had a slight technical problem.<eos> Technical problem?<eos> Whatever happened to the old boob-boob-seduce?<eos> I wanted to... but Double-O-Dumb-Dumb decided we should use his janky-ass spy gear instead.<eos> But, you know, until I can get you out of here, I smuggled you in something.
It's me, Bonnie.<eos> I am the genius you speak of!<eos> I did it, I did it, I did it!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> So you're saying that you were the mastermind behind the entire real estate scam, and that Brad was just a mere pawn?<eos> I am.<eos> Though I do honestly wish Brad was here so I could explain to him how sorry I am.<eos> Well, then you're in luck...<eos> - Aha! Caught you, you rat bastard!
Hey, bro. I was...<eos> If you're here to give me advice from your stupid baby book, I'm good.<eos> I know I never tell you this... but you're a great brother, and a great dad.<eos> Oh my God, are you dying?<eos> You can't leave me here with Mom.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy and the baby's not even here yet.<eos> I just want everything to go perfectly.<eos> You make it all seem so easy.<eos> Man, when it comes to kids, there is no perfect.<eos> Nothing in your book is going to prepare you for the roller coaster that is being a parent.
I'm saying I'm done with you.<eos> Now, before I go, I'm just gonna old-man drink this glass of water.<eos> Now, to take an old man pee.<eos> Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.<eos> We're having sloppy Joes.<eos> Eh, what else you got?<eos> How about a knuckle sandwich?<eos> If Peter said that, you all would've lost your minds laughing.<eos> It's just that at Carter's house, if you don't want something heavy,<eos> Étienne will whip you up an egg dish with some shallots and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.
What-what's going on here?<eos> Um... you've got a friend in me?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I-I thought you were rehearsing with the guys.<eos> Ah, the bastards kicked me out 'cause I'm not good enough.<eos> Oh, and they also taught me that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer, so maybe you should, uh, you know, do the test.<eos> I had cancer, Peter. Remember?<eos> I was in the hospital? You weren't there for it.<eos> Well, maybe you have it again.<eos> Peter, I'm not falling for your trick, but if you're upset about the guys kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.
- planning a wedding anyway, to be honest, Lauren.<eos> - OK, great.<eos> - Then it shouldn't be a problem, then?<eos> - No, fine. All right. - OK, cool.<eos> - I know what you're doing, OK?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Stop blackmailing me right now.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Making me pay for your trek tickets, so that you don't tell Lauren about our sexual sex.<eos> I just asked you for help, Dylan, seeing as you were going to ditch me and I don't have any money.
Yeah, Norm is such a great guy.<eos> He never would have done something like this.<eos> No, because Jesus won't let him.<eos> Look, it only happened once.<eos> That's enough to get an STD, Dylan!<eos> - That's all it takes!<eos> - OK, I do not have an STD.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Would you stay out of this, please?<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
We need to bounce back!<eos> That's the point!<eos> And it's hardly near death.<eos> It's a little kiddie one.<eos> Even if the bungee snapped, you would still probably survive it.<eos> OK, now you've put that idea into my head, so I'm definitely not doing it.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Come on!<eos> We're doing this for Genevieve.<eos> This will be good for you, May.
I'm just the ape that got lucky.<eos> Welcome to my world.<eos> Join the club, boy!<eos> Any more of that Michael Buble knocking about?<eos> - Sure thing.<eos> - Top me up, Buttercup!<eos> I heard about Daisy, by the way, Greg.<eos> I'm sorry, mate, you deserve better.<eos> Yeah, well, it gives me a chance to come and see you, doesn't it?<eos> Well, I've only been pestering you about it for 13 years!
Today's going to be a very, very busy day, so I need all of you to do exactly as I say.<eos> Right. Red number 15 and 16, you two are a couple.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Costume, now.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Oh, God. Dyl, me and Ash are a couple.<eos> Should I say something?<eos> I'd be careful if I was you, mate.<eos> You don't want to end up lunging.<eos> What? What if she just thinks of you as a mate?
Excuse me.<eos> Hi. Why is mine black?<eos> The outbreak starts in Chinatown.<eos> Nice!<eos> This is so not funny.<eos> Oh! I don't know why you're laughing.<eos> I'd rather be pregnant than whatever that is.<eos> Hello, hello, hello!<eos> What's all this, then?<eos> That weirdly sort of suits you.
Torres, number 6.<eos> Yep.<eos> 12?<eos> Yes.<eos> And 17?<eos> Here! Married couple, numbers 15 and 16.<eos> Oh, decided to swap.<eos> Oh. Well, you divorced me already.<eos> And I thought we were meant to be.<eos> Look, I don't care whoever knocked you up.
Yes, May!<eos> Oh, that is so good.<eos> Wow! Did you get all this for us?<eos> Er...<eos> Yes! Obviously, I'm not going to eat all this by myself.<eos> Yo.<eos> I spoke to her.<eos> Sorry man, I don't know.<eos> She doesn't fancy you.<eos> She thinks a lot of you, no question.
And I don't think you do, either.<eos> This is just what you do.<eos> You flip flop.<eos> I don't flip flop.<eos> Er, hello? Lauren, the novel writing?<eos> Yeah, but that's totally different.<eos> I see that now.<eos> And this thing between us is real.<eos> This is the real thing, Ash.<eos> This might come as a shock, Dylan, but not everyone loves you as much as you love yourself.
Come on!<eos> So some shithead scammed a hotel in Vietnam using my business card information, pretending to be me. - No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - .. totally uncool.<eos> It just makes me angry hearing about it.<eos> Yeah, and then my boss blames me for handing out too many business cards<eos> - which is ridiculous, because why have them?<eos> - Yeah. Your boss sounds like an arsehole if he fired you for that.
You work in recruitment, Mum, surely you can recruit someone, or invite a colleague even?<eos> They're busy, they're covering for me.<eos> Or what about that French guy?<eos> I'm not talking to Pierre right now.<eos> Besides, I'm here to see you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if you find me irritating or intrusive.<eos> It's just that... you keep shutting me out.<eos> You know, I don't know what's going on.<eos> I feel like...<eos> I feel like I'm losing you.
Mommy, let go!<eos> You're hurting me!<eos> O-O-Okay. Uh, uh, go get ready for school, honey.<eos> Isn't Mommy gonna blow out the candles?<eos> She'll blow them out later.<eos> Off you go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What happened to you?
Be right back. Everything's the same.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> ...city in terror as the killer claims a fourth victim in a grim replay of city in terror and the killer claims an all-too familiar scenario.<eos> He's killing them.<eos> I-It's all happening the same.<eos> You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the world.<eos> That is your fate... written in stone a million years before you were born.<eos> Mom.<eos> Why are you acting so weird today?<eos> I am not gonna let anybody hurt you this time.
No, I just can't stop seeing it.<eos> The gory ritual, the broken seal. It's just, every time I close my eyes, it's the same nightmare.<eos> Right, but nothing else has... happened, right?<eos> Yet.<eos> - I forgot you were head cheerleader.<eos> - And Prom Queen. Prom.<eos> That's that thing people do when they're not institutionalized at 14, right?<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> Are you going to be this much fun all day?<eos> Maybe I'll just skedaddle, you know, leave you at the mercy of monsters, go on the I am.
I don't see one.<eos> But it's no simple murder either.<eos> The victim's liver was harvested, but he had no opioids in his system.<eos> And no defensive wounds.<eos> - It's like he let it happen.<eos> - Or he ripped it out himself.<eos> - Where's Lucado?<eos> - Called away.<eos> On a personal matter.<eos> Has, uh, Dolls reached out to you at all?
Don't tell me how to do my job.<eos> Perry?<eos> Skip?<eos> It's too late.<eos> - It got B-Train.<eos> - B-Train.<eos> What's that?<eos> Perry put it there.<eos> He's out of his gourd.<eos> Perry marked you with blood?
The time is nigh.<eos> I will claim what is mine.<eos> - Holy farked up Wizard of Oz bullshit!<eos> - No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now roll over.<eos> Beg?<eos> Dude! What are you doing?<eos> It'll go through you to get what it wants, and it wants my guts, man.
- No!<eos> It's just... ever since Willa was... sent down, - she's been acting... not herself.<eos> Well, one sister kills the other.<eos> - Might rattle your cage a bit.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> It's just, what I really love about Waverly is... it's like it's sometimes missing, you know, a sweetness.<eos> And she's become hard. Cruel, almost.<eos> More...<eos> Like me?<eos> Is this because she kept you out of Black Badge?
[Kimmy] Kimberly Cougar Schmidt, rubbing elbows with the elites the rest of the country hates.<eos> [laughs] It seems like just yesterday I was eating hair sandwiches in the bunker.<eos> [chuckles] It's not funny.<eos> Which one of these scrunchies says,<eos> "I do word searches in pen"?<eos> Girl, put those pocket buttholes away and think about me for once.<eos> [sighs] What does one even wear to a fifth-gay-baby-meeting date?<eos> Emily Post is silent on the subject.<eos> Titus, I'm impressed.<eos> I would have thought a guy with a baby would freak you out.
-[bell ringing] -[clears throat] Uh, mes putains?<eos> Dinner is served!<eos> If you are allergic to any of the vegetables mentioned in Shakespeare, you will find nothing to your liking.<eos> [chuckles] [exhales softly] Lookit, you want to stick through this together?<eos> ♪ Ooh, E, Elijah rock ♪ [humming]<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Just picking up a new robe from the church office.<eos> My last one shrunk in the wash after I ate a ham.<eos> Well, I wasn't expecting this meeting to happen till tonight, but, Titus,<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Linda.
You think it's an accident "google" is just "go ogle" without the space?<eos> Sure, it's kind of a moral gray area, but--<eos> No, some things are pretty black-and-white.<eos> Uh, newspapers.<eos> A penguin before it goes in a blender.<eos> Rainbows if you're a dog.<eos> And snooping on people's secrets.<eos> Carry on.<eos> I'm sorry. I thought you knew that stuff was out there.<eos> I feel terrible about what happened to you.
Are you going to stay for Karen's birthday cupcakes?<eos> Uh, is Linda D. proud of her nephew? [laughs]<eos> You know I am. Stop it, girl.<eos> Hey, if I hook you guys up, will you drive me to my boyfriend's wife's house later?<eos> Hi, Dr. Bayden.<eos> Kimmy.<eos> What a terrible surprise.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> The Internet.<eos> I googled you, and there are a ton of complaints about your piercings on Yelp.
It was draining my magic. What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because there's no magic in that heart.<eos> It's just a worthless piece of glass.<eos> For it to work, it needs someone else's magic...<eos> My magic.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> Zelena, I swear I had no idea.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Who put you up to this?
Your team needs to get ahold of their emotions.<eos> Deeks especially.<eos> Mr. Deeks is showing more grace than I would have expected.<eos> Well, this isn't personal.<eos> The hell it's not.<eos> You and your ghouls have tried to pick off everyone on my team.<eos> I was weeding out the bad apples.<eos> Trying to do the right thing.<eos> Then where is Miss Blye?<eos> Like I told you before, Hetty, I have no idea.
Mr. Callen, step away from CIA Officer Taylor.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> Officer Taylor?<eos> Callen.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm the bad guy.<eos> Jones.<eos> Assistant Director.<eos> Uh... Granger.<eos> Field work suits you.
Finish the sting. Bring Donald Clark in.<eos> Or we're gonna have a problem.<eos> All right, get Omar Fry down here. Set up a fake hit that you can show Donald Clark.<eos> Get him on tape giving you the rest of the money.<eos> Listen, Hank, I think I got through to Clark.<eos> - I think he might back out of this thing.<eos> - Al.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Remember the Family Secrets sting? When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?<eos> Hey, so did Detective Lindsay explain everything to you?
There are books about writing books, books about reading books...<eos> Dad, I appreciate all the books, but...<eos> Even books about forgiving.<eos> "Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself."<eos> Deepak Chopra.<eos> Via Suzanne Somers.<eos> Look, I know that you're sorry, but...<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> But you did.<eos> And it's gonna take a while for people to forgive you no matter how many books you buy.
I could stay a little longer.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Go.<eos> You were terrible at your job.<eos> What?<eos> And you're deluding yourself if you think this book deal's going anywhere, especially with that ridiculous D-list publisher.<eos> But congrats, you're a half a step above self-publishing online.<eos> Wow.<eos> Chloe... you're a horrible person.<eos> And I tried to make excuses for you over the years, like maybe your parents didn't hug you, or maybe you grew up in a prison like Bane from that Batman movie, but I just think it comes down to who you are:
Just wait.<eos> No, just give me a second!<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> Wait!<eos> Chloe!<eos> Wait.<eos> I know I was rash.<eos> I got caught up in the excitement of getting a book deal, and I shouldn't have quit.<eos> But I know you haven't found a replacement, and let's face it, no one knows you better than I do.
I would never want to make you feel badly about that.<eos> Parenting is hard enough.<eos> It was probably Carly.<eos> She is a huge gossip, which is why I let her go.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> - I thought this was settled!<eos> - It was, but somehow it leaked that we started this smear campaign, and now they're suing you for violating the non-disparagement clause.
Ah, you must be very proud.<eos> I get us a tea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tonk!<eos> Did I frighten you?<eos> No<eos> I'm Sam<eos> Do you want me to guess your's?<eos> It's Chrissy.<eos> What did it feel like this morning, when everyone was looking at you?
Well, what if I said I liked you?<eos> That's not giving to receive.<eos> Yes, it is, because at some point, you expect me to say that I like you back.<eos> It's just a nice thing to say.<eos> It's what people do.<eos> I don't give a shit what people do.<eos> Oh, well, I do like you.<eos> Can I see you later?<eos> What's going on, Sam?<eos> 've only just stopped you from being suspended.
What are you talking about?<eos> What did the ed say?<eos> She said you didn't form close friendships.<eos> What would she know, she barely knows who I am.<eos> Oh, I don't know, she asked your Form teacher, then.<eos> He thinks there's something wrong with everyone.<eos> Of course, I've got friends!<eos> You didn't believe it, did you?<eos> Well, I don't know what to believe<eos> Is there something worrying you?
You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.<eos> No, it does not involve eating pork.<eos> We are putting in a pool with a resistance training feature. Isn't that a...<eos> little pricey?<eos> We can afford it now, baby.<eos> Hey, Trish, why don't, why don't, why don't we just put the bonus money into our retirement fund?<eos> Or we could put it into the college...<eos> Baby, I'm gonna ask you to do something for me that goes against every fiber of your being.
- Okay. A few people died today down at that shop.<eos> Don't you want to help us know why?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I seem to be out of change.<eos> Black and creamy.<eos> It's done!<eos> It's so hot!<eos> Okay, I was in the bathroom when the shots were fired, so I didn't see anything.<eos> As for Mr. Ruiz, he was my client for exactly one day.<eos> What, Flaco hired you the day of?
Did I say "insane"?<eos> You've covered my better qualities.<eos> All right.<eos> But I've never seen you like this before.<eos> How's that?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Well, I mean, you know, man, I did jump out of a helicopter earlier today.<eos> So, you know, I'm sure there's a little... residual fear is normal.<eos> Yeah, but that's not what it is.<eos> See, dying doesn't scare you, living does.
That was you?<eos> First on scene.<eos> This rotor ripped right through a lawn, crashed through a fence, and it landed on top of this woman. - No way.<eos> - Hey, if I'm lying I'm dying.<eos> So Herrmann and I, we rush over and she's still breathing.<eos> It's like some early Christmas miracle.<eos> Now, I-I'm peeing my pants, obviously, but Herrmann's calm as a cucumber. He says to me...<eos> "Go get the tool bag."<eos> So, I run for the truck at a dead sprint.<eos> Hey, remember when I asked you out?
I mean, I'm not...<eos> I'm not gonna be here much longer 'cause I'm putting in my notice next shift.<eos> No.<eos> No, you... you can't let him win.<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> - No, Missy, listen. I did two years under Tipton, and I hated every last shift, but I made it through.<eos> The one thing I can say about working at 27 is it made me stronger, and now I'm at 51, and it's...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Well... well, technically...<eos> They transferred you right back here.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - And then when you do call, you're dressed like freakin' Jackie O, you got someone's blood on you, and even then, it's like,<eos> "Patch this guy up and get the hell out of here."<eos> It is not safe for you to be here right now, and I just... you have to go.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop saying you're sorry. I... I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what else to say. - Explain it to me!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I...<eos> What happened to you, Lucy?
- It's red.<eos> - I was rubbing it.<eos> It's, like, super, like, spaghetti-sauce red.<eos> What if this is because we put four people in the Lifeboat?<eos> Or it's a bloodshot eye.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your Wyatt's fine.<eos> And I take it Rufus has recovered too.<eos> I just wanted you to know when I destroy Rittenhouse tonight... and I will... that also includes your grandfather,<eos> Ethan Cahill, which means... honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen to you, but whatever it is, it's probably not good.
I'd love to, but time isn't something we have a lot of right now.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> Why the hell would I go anywhere with you?<eos> Because I've disabled the security systems, and the guards still work for me.<eos> They'll look the other way.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - I'll take my chances.<eos> With what?<eos> There's no due process here.<eos> Please, come with me, or let your family spend the rest of their lives wondering what happened to you.
I don't want to kill them.<eos> I have to kill them to put my wife and child back on this earth.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - You don't know that and both of you would do the same.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right. We would.<eos> We are all so caught up in our grief, in our past, in our pain, and we can't let go, so we just continue to hurt more people.<eos> I prayed to God... for answers.<eos> And he led me here to this.<eos> What if he led you to me?
Hands behind your back!<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> - You followed me?<eos> - He's a terrorist, Lucy.<eos> - Just think about what he's done.<eos> - Think about what we've done.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I trusted you, Lucy.<eos> I trusted you with my family.
- Look, I'm busy. - Doing what?<eos> Uh, calling my lawyer.<eos> If you saw a shooting, and you wanted to be a good citizen, you'd go to the closest District, right?<eos> 19's just a few blocks away.<eos> Instead, Burrows walks a mile and a half to Narcotics to make a statement to Banks and Kim.<eos> You want my opinion?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think you're approaching this with clear eyes.<eos> - Forget about it.<eos> - Hey, look, I'm just saying. Everybody looks bad to you, except for the guy shot with a key of H in his car.
I drive a Corolla.<eos> Stephen's got a BMW.<eos> He's the one who wanted the money.<eos> He was the lead detective in every case.<eos> I just went along for the ride.<eos> And why did you do that?<eos> I've been doing this job for almost 30 years.<eos> I've learned who's who and what's what.<eos> I look at a guy for a second, I know he's garbage.<eos> And these people we kill, they shoot you as soon as look at you.
Stories of immigrants who arrived all alone, young women with no families, suddenly vanish.<eos> NOPD look into it?<eos> Said they did, but the women aren't citizens, so there's nothing they could do.<eos> The police hardly come around Clearwater anymore, anyway.<eos> So, you decided to take matters into your own hands.<eos> I had no choice!<eos> I wasn't going to let them take my wife!<eos> Calm down, Brossette.<eos> I used my training, tracked down leads, learned a blue van had been hanging around where Amelia was last seen.<eos> And that blue van led you to Hayes.
By the time we get through all that bureaucracy, she'll be gone, and we can't let that happen.<eos> Dwayne?<eos> Rita, what... what's going on?<eos> Hamilton sent me. Hamilton?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Because I'm both JAG and A.D.A., and Sergeant Brossette's case could be heard in either court.<eos> Hold up, what case?<eos> Marine killed a civilian, right?<eos> And word is, you have him in custody, Dwayne, so I'm here to take him in.<eos> And Hamilton sent you?
I have been dreaming about this spread.<eos> You know how pissed off I am right now?<eos> Have a glass of Brézé.<eos> Make you feel better. Same one from our fifth anniversary.<eos> Alex Aufiero was murdered. But you know that since you fled the crime scene in his car.<eos> I was gonna tell you right before your friend interrupted us.<eos> My friend, the NCIS agent, who was coming to take me to investigate the homicide you're involved in!<eos> Alex was a good kid.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Every cop in the city is after you right now.
Previously, on The Fosters...<eos> Are you the student responsible for the art installation?<eos> I'm a professor at San Diego School of Art and Design.<eos> You should do one thing a day that scares you.
I mean, I want to do something by myself.<eos> Since I got this TBI, people treat me like I...<eos> I... I'm special needs. Plus, you know Mariana.<eos> She's just gonna take control of the whole thing and make it all about her.<eos> I don't think that's true, Jesus.<eos> Well, I don't think you really know her, Gabe.<eos> That's...<eos> I mean, I don't... know her very well, but, you know... she talked to me.<eos> She talked to you.<eos> Yeah, of course she talked to you.
- Mm. - You okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, I thought you were coming over. What happened?<eos> I know, I just have so much packing to do before we leave tomorrow.<eos> So, I'm not gonna see you before you go?<eos> Well, I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> I love... you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did Mamas talk to you about the tree house?
Well, you know...<eos> I wasn't trying to seduce you, if that's what you think.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Okay, I was... yeah, I was.<eos> I guess I shouldn't have read Fifty Shades of Grey.<eos> - No, I'm an idiot.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I'm the idiot. I...<eos> I don't know, I thought that you were blowing me off, so that's when I... but then when you completely didn't get it, that's when I made up that ex-boyfriend story.<eos> I wasn't trying to blow you off, really.
Of course we are.<eos> Of course.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Uh, Jesus had a, uh... pretty violent reaction from finding out what Brandon did.<eos> You know, taking Emma to...<eos> What do you mean, violent?<eos> Well, we found him taking a baseball bat to some of Brandon's stuff.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah. Jesus, you took a baseball bat to Brandon's room?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Ah, that was intense.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, thanks for hanging in with me though all that.<eos> So...<eos> Still think you're heading to Tahoe?<eos> Not right now.<eos> Now I... kinda feel like Jesus needs me, you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what about you and Mariana?<eos> Oh, I can't believe this happened to you honey.
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?<eos> - I just wish that all my projects didn't have to be about me.<eos> Well, all the great artists did self-portraits.<eos> - Picasso, van Gogh. - Yeah, but I'm not a great artist.<eos> I don't know how to draw myself.<eos> - Take a selfie.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You took those great pictures of me on the beach.<eos> Yeah, but that was because you didn't know I was taking them.<eos> How about we take candid photos of you and then you can decide which one looks the most like you.
Uh, no, because I asked you out.<eos> Ready to order?<eos> Yeah. You like seafood?<eos> Okay, we'll start with the shrimp fritters and patatas bravas.<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> Sure.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Helping you with your self-portrait.
♪ But then this thing with you ♪<eos> ♪ Is making me feel I can start anew ♪<eos> ♪ Sorry I was so insecure ♪<eos> ♪ I couldn't tell what you wanted me for ♪<eos> ♪ I guess I thought ♪<eos> ♪ You just wanted sex ♪<eos> ♪ So I got all ♪<eos> ♪ Weird ♪<eos> We, uh... all get weird.<eos> And I don't just want you for sex, okay?
Then, as of this moment, STEAM Club is suspended.<eos> And if one more issue of this paper makes it to campus, I'm canceling prom as well.<eos> We'll see how popular you are if that happens.<eos> I never should have let you talk me into this.<eos> I told you not to code it to operate in full manual mode.<eos> This is why you're not at Worlds.<eos> You think you know everything.<eos> I'm not at Worlds because I decided not to go.<eos> From what I heard, if you hadn't taken yourself out, they were gonna push you out.<eos> Nobody wants you on their team, Mariana.
You're not in trouble, Andy.<eos> I'm not a... victim or whatever.<eos> It sounds to us like you're engaging in survival sex.<eos> You're staying with an older man?<eos> And what if I was?<eos> Treated me hell of a lot better than my own parents.<eos> At least I had a place to sleep and food to eat.<eos> Well, I can't imagine... everything you've been through.<eos> The pain of being rejected by your parents.<eos> But what this man is doing to you... it's not right.
Previously on The Fosters... I'm not at World's because I decided not to go.<eos> Nobody wants you on their team, Mariana.
Previously on The Fosters... I'm not at World's because I decided not to go.<eos> Nobody wants you on their team, Mariana.<eos> You have a junior team?<eos> As if our moms would let us play a contact sport.<eos> Why treat girls any different?<eos> There are so many unknowns about traumatic brain injuries.<eos> I told you that you shouldn't get involved with me. That I had a kid.<eos> You should do one thing a day that scares you.
As if our moms would let us play a contact sport.<eos> Why treat girls any different?<eos> There are so many unknowns about traumatic brain injuries.<eos> I told you that you shouldn't get involved with me. That I had a kid.<eos> You should do one thing a day that scares you.<eos> Guys, this is Cole.<eos> Yet you won't date me, because you don't see me as a guy.<eos> Uh, this is Dawn.<eos> Callie saw AJ kissing another girl.<eos> I love you, Callie, but it shouldn't be so hard.
But what?<eos> You don't have to be afraid of me.<eos> Emma, I'm not mad at you.<eos> I think you are.<eos> I don't think you're mad that Brandon took me to get an abortion.<eos> I think you're mad that I had one.<eos> Yeah, I'm mad that you didn't tell me about it.<eos> Why? Do you think that would have made a difference?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mariana told me... that you never wanted to be like your birth parents because they abandoned you and that if you were in their same position, you would be a dad to your kid no matter what.
By the way, Mason is so adorable.<eos> - You know Mason?<eos> - Yeah. We babysat him together.<eos> Oh. How nice.<eos> Uh, cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I just don't think I should be making any trouble.<eos> You wouldn't be.<eos> But I'd, like, be wearing a wire?<eos> Yes, but I would be close by, and I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Okay, but they did deport a DACA student recently, and he did nothing wrong.<eos> - Look, I'm on your side. - No, I know, I know.<eos> But, um, she can't hide that she's Latina.<eos> You think that I'm hiding?<eos> No.<eos> It's not deceptive of me to not disclose my private medical information.<eos> No, I am... I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it that way.<eos> I'm just saying, like...<eos> People look at you and they have no idea what you've been through or how hard you've had to fight - to be who you really are.
Okay, nerd, let's get something straight.<eos> I need your help, but I am not your friend.<eos> I will not be making you over for a dance, and if you take your glasses off,<eos> I will not be all, "Wait.<eos> [laughs] I'm cool, okay?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -[sighs] I need a standard five-year boom box tune-up.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what that is.<eos> Is it a Zune?<eos> This is why everybody hates you, Kyle.
Oh, don't worry, honey.<eos> Sean Penn isn't real. They just made him up to scare kids.<eos> Drench Thunderman is Reverending the entire city.<eos> I've got to warn people that he's just a liar with amazing teeth.<eos> [Lillian] Ooh. Turn on the news.<eos> That's where all the old-people commercials are.<eos> My likeness and my mouthness were stolen by a drug company.<eos> They turned me into a bladder.<eos> Brother, you're always thinking that people are ripping you off.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure that guy who loves Patti LaBelle's pies isn't copying you.
All these years, I blamed a cruel and jealous world for my lack of success, but it's my fault.<eos> Because like that little bladder, I only care about number one.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I've ruined every opportunity I've ever been given.<eos> But you got that part in Mahogany.<eos> By accident.<eos> And they loved you.<eos> You were the star of the show.<eos> -I bet they'd hire you again in a--
-It's called Profiles--<eos> -Really? Is she married to that?<eos> It's not fair.<eos> First Jacqueline gets a hottie with a body-- trademark me, 1994-- and now you're gonna be on TV, and TV's in yet another golden age.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Mr. Donnie Wahlberg gave up music superstardom for exactly this kind of opportunity.<eos> But Xan wants me to talk about the bunker.<eos> It's bad enough that everyone can just look me up on the Internet, but I don't want people to see me as some symbol.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Everyone just thinks of you as Titus' busted hag.
I don't--<eos> You can use it to feed your cats with this automatic cat feeder.<eos> "For if you ever leave your apartment."<eos> And you can check on your stuff with this wireless security camera.<eos> Hey, this thing has night vision.<eos> Maybe now I can finally catch that ghost.<eos> Or realize it's just Titus stealing your food in a sheet.<eos> Yeah, that's what you think.<eos> And this is a mini 3-D printer.<eos> TSA doesn't allow weapons on planes, but when we get to Stockholm, we can print a copy of that hammer you're always carrying around with you.
Of course.<eos> No, the toilet rat.<eos> It's going extinct.<eos> Who cares? I hope it does!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, that weird, unloved little creature, that's who I used to be, and I don't want to be reminded of it.<eos> 'Cause I'm a pretty tiger now.<eos> Every minute of my life has been a struggle, against animal poachers and slum lords and my own family.<eos> I know.<eos> Your brothers nearly punch-buggied you to death.
Well, he died, didn't he?<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> It's a fox shell.<eos> Fasciolaria trapezium.<eos> [sighs] Russ, this is still inside you.<eos> I know. Because my brothers...<eos> No, I mean, that kid in the attic is a big part of who you are, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> I do.<eos> I was in the attic because I was hiding from my family.<eos> I know. They tormented you.
Hotsy-totsy Liberace.<eos> I've killed another one.<eos> Good evening. I'm Xanthippe Voorhees. And welcome to the first-ever episode of Profiles.<eos> My guest tonight is a symbol of courage and hope.<eos> So all you Xan-Heads out there, please give a warm welcome to Kimmy Schmidt.<eos> Thank you, Xan.<eos> I can't believe that high school girl I once caught trying to bury her wet sheets in the garden has a TV show.<eos> No!<eos> Why?<eos> Just tell us what happened to you.
It's about respect.<eos> What's wrong, baby?<eos> Supposed to be a happy night, huh?<eos> Happy new year, baby.<eos> He tell you what he was giving me?<eos> Hell no.<eos> If I knew what he was giving you,<eos> I would have told him, "Hell no, that's not enough."<eos> Come on, now.<eos> What'd he give you?
You used disguises, Which was smart,<eos> Except, in your cabin,<eos> We found six pairs Of sunglasses, Some fake mustaches, And then your journal entries Logging your disguises.<eos> This is the chemical components Of the explosive mixture.<eos> And, um, the epoxy That was used in the box,<eos> Your typewriter that was used For the address label, Carbon paper,<eos> And a receipt For the carbon paper.<eos> It just goes on and on,<eos> And, ted, they have Thousands of pieces of evidence.<eos> That can link you To the unabom, But they only need one To convict you. They're gonna bury you Under a mountain of evidence,
It just goes on and on,<eos> And, ted, they have Thousands of pieces of evidence.<eos> That can link you To the unabom, But they only need one To convict you. They're gonna bury you Under a mountain of evidence,<eos> And all your autonomy Is gonna go out the window. The first day of trial.<eos> He's looking good.<eos> Now reel him in.<eos> I want you To change the world. I want you To start a revolution.<eos> But if you fight this...<eos> If you fight this, You are gonna lose control Of everything in your life. You're gonna be a helpless cog In the machine of justice.<eos> Until they strap you down To the electric chair. You have one option.
That's it.<eos> Can I ask you One question?<eos> Anything. Since you've been So helpful.<eos> Walking me through What evidence the f.B.I. Has, I was hoping You might confirm for me. Something I've suspected For a long time.<eos> There is no forensic evidence Whatsoever. Tying me To these heinous crimes. Besides what you found In my cabin.<eos> Imagine if you could throw out All that evidence.<eos> Because it's all here On the table. You just laid it all out In front of me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> James, do you really Not have any idea.<eos> Why I brought you here?
And it was right. You are more Than this case, fitz,<eos> Even if you don't believe it, Even if they never Give you credit for it.<eos> That has to mean something, Right?<eos> What was that About credit? Credit... That is the way back in.<eos> Ted wants to be famous. He wants everyone to know How smart he is. The only way He's gonna get the credit.<eos> You bet the farm once before That he'd need a trophy.<eos> This is different.<eos> Look how that turned out.<eos> This is different.<eos> You know that. You can convince me All night, But there's no way Cole will let you in there.
I'll go on my own.<eos> Make the call.<eos> It'll be off the record, Just me and ted, Facetoface. I'll make...<eos> Make the call.<eos> I'm off the case.<eos> I'm going home. I thought it best If you heard it from me.<eos> There's one thing I would like to ask you. Before I leave.<eos> Did you do all this. Because you wanted to make A difference in the world, To change things?<eos> That's what I admired about you.<eos> You know, I admired you so much, I gave up everything To live like you...
Well, I... I walk away a free man, Vindicated as the victim.<eos> Aren't you Forgetting a step? Before you walk free,<eos> You got to stand In front of a judge and say,<eos> "I'm not guilty."<eos> I didn't write the manifesto, Didn't elude the f.B.I. For 2 decades. "I'm just a nobody Who stands for nothing."<eos> No.<eos> See, your... Your logic is flawed.<eos> I'm gonna be acquitted On a technicality, Not on the merits Of the case.<eos> I won't be saying That I'm not the unabomber.<eos> You say that on tv, Then people who admire you, Like me, Are just gonna think You're a hypocrite.
Well, I guess you never really know someone, do you?<eos> And who's gonna wear these dainty little things?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's not you.<eos> An asset I'm developing...<eos> a reporter from the Journal.<eos> The one who exposed Sean Gregory?<eos> Well, someone's got to find out how that happened.<eos> See you next time the world explodes.<eos> Since when does Ryan ski?<eos> Um, your ex-fiancé is most likely dating someone for the first time since you... a likely asset... and that is your headline?
That's...<eos> What a smart man does who knows his limits... asks for the help he knows he needs.<eos> So... help me.<eos> Help me trust myself again.<eos> Help me be... who I was... instead of who I am right now.<eos> The finest Pinot grigio that your local supermarket sells. Mm.<eos> Funny.<eos> I pegged you as more of an Old World red kind of guy.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> Is the FBI right behind you?
That's what I called him, my Sweet Boy.<eos> I know it's silly.<eos> Was there a time when he stopped being sweet?<eos> Dylan was five.<eos> My brother Frank was taking him fishing.<eos> He was so excited, you know, like little boys get.<eos> When he got home... he was different.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Watch it, young man.<eos> I know what he did to you.
We know you saw him do more than just step on the paper bag.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> He came up to me at the rave.<eos> He said he knew me, that we'd met on the L, like, three months ago. But I had no idea.<eos> He said that he asked me to have a cup of coffee back then.<eos> - Did you go out with him?<eos> - No. I had to study.<eos> That's what he said I told him.<eos> But I swear, I don't remember this at all.<eos> What else did he tell you, Tamra?
Oh, I hurt my foot the other day. It's not a big deal.<eos> Can you put your full weight on it?<eos> God, no.<eos> Have you seen a doctor?<eos> No. Well, is it swollen?<eos> A little.<eos> Okay, a lot.<eos> All right, come on. Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna take you to the ER.
It's a rule.<eos> This is where I write all the rules.<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, my God! Casey, you have to try that on.<eos> No. No, no, no, no. It is so you.<eos> I'm probably not gonna go to the dance.<eos> Evan's, like, banned from school property.<eos> Try it on.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Mm... It's gonna look really cute on you.
Coastal sucks.<eos> Go, Horns.<eos> That guy doesn't give a damn about Jesse's cousin.<eos> All he's interested in is that kid's arm.<eos> Yeah, well, his football days are over.<eos> I took a peek at his chart.<eos> The bullet tore through his rotator cuff.<eos> He's never throwing a football again.<eos> Poor kid.<eos> You think you know what life has to offer you, and then...
That's my highlight reel.<eos> For all the recruiters.<eos> It's useless now.<eos> Everyone knows I'm over.<eos> Hey, your football career may be over, but you are not over.<eos> You're 18.<eos> You'll find something else.<eos> You have no idea, man.<eos> I have no idea?<eos> What it's like to have college scouts crawling all over you, calling you the next big thing?
Yeah?<eos> How you know that?<eos> Because he stepped up to the wrong guy.<eos> So, who'd he piss off?<eos> So, this guy who believes in you, what's his name?<eos> Benny.<eos> Benny Barnes.<eos> - Who's that, Bailey?<eos> - No.<eos> It's not me. Who else calls you?
How you know that?<eos> Because he stepped up to the wrong guy.<eos> So, who'd he piss off?<eos> So, this guy who believes in you, what's his name?<eos> Benny.<eos> Benny Barnes.<eos> - Who's that, Bailey?<eos> - No.<eos> It's not me. Who else calls you?<eos> So you finally meet a woman that tolerates you, that you actually like, but you won't take her call.
Yeah, eight years now.<eos> He was a phenomenal talent.<eos> Shame what happened to him.<eos> Yeah, you know anybody who might want to make that happen to him or his cousin?<eos> No, but he's from a tough neighborhood.<eos> I was hoping to help Jesse get out.<eos> Sad I couldn't.<eos> So, what are you, like, his, his manager?<eos> No, I was more like an adviser, see.<eos> 'Cause I know what it's like to have everyone want a piece of you at that age.
Sad I couldn't.<eos> So, what are you, like, his, his manager?<eos> No, I was more like an adviser, see.<eos> 'Cause I know what it's like to have everyone want a piece of you at that age.<eos> So I just try to provide a little guidance.<eos> Golden Glove.<eos> That's right.<eos> Rog, you know who we're talking to here? Yeah, I do.<eos> That's, Mr. Barnes, and he's about to tell us what he was doing last night.<eos> He got you on the ropes, Benny... just like Lewis in '96.
Who'd you go to, Ma?<eos> Who, Benny?<eos> Who, Ma?<eos> Hey, Wendell!<eos> My mom told me everything!<eos> She cut you in to get Steven in line!<eos> But you killed him, man!<eos> Better watch yourself now, Jesse.<eos> You not some hotshot prospect anymore.<eos> Something happens to you, ain't nobody gonna care.
May I have your attention, please?<eos> I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.<eos> And I just want to say, shame on all of you.<eos> We're scientists.<eos> Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.<eos> He's right.<eos> And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.<eos> Thank you, Bert.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
Last one kind of soured me on the idea.<eos> Yeah. Long time ago, though.<eos> Divorce happened just before Gordon's case, didn't it?<eos> That's the reason I moved here.<eos> New beginnings and all.<eos> Yeah. A lot to go through.<eos> Gordon's case must've made it even harder.<eos> Where are we going with all this, Dwayne?<eos> Not going anywhere, just...<eos> I know that your husband didn't treat you right, either, so...
Thank you.<eos> Jack Gordon... pled guilty to killing Janet Ortega 20 years ago.<eos> A week after your release, a key witness against you was murdered in the exact same way.<eos> Why should I believe you're innocent?<eos> Because I am innocent.<eos> I never stopped trying to prove it, never will.<eos> Why'd you call Chief Decker the moment you were paroled?<eos> Because I needed her help to prove I didn't kill Janet.<eos> I convinced her I wasn't guilty.<eos> So, somebody set you up 20 years ago? Somebody set you up yesterday-- is that what you're saying?
I gave Janet that knife for protection.<eos> From me.<eos> I got crazy at times.<eos> And I abused her when I wasn't in my right mind, I know. But that's why I wanted Janet to be able to protect herself in case. She had to leave me.<eos> I could never kill her, Agent Pride.<eos> Same way I could never kill Karen Decker.<eos> Karen was the only one willing to help me.<eos> Wh-Why would I?<eos> So let's say I believe you.<eos> Who set you up?
You can't fit in my clothes.<eos> Ugh! It's for the maloney's white trash party, okay?<eos> It's the biggest party of the year.<eos> Yeah, okay. Well, in that case.<eos> It's gonna be awesome.<eos> The youngest one, danny, Is in my grade, so i get to go this year.<eos> I heard their sister's bringing a bunch of her friends From st.<eos> Margaret's.<eos> Oh, yeah. The place is gonna be running wild With repressed catholic school girls.<eos> Don't pretend that doesn't terrify you.
Why this place?<eos> Computer rental store.<eos> Computers.<eos> Technology.<eos> What did these people Symbolize to you?<eos> You got to work early,<eos> You didn't expect them To be there.<eos> 10 seconds, 20 seconds... That's all you needed.<eos> But she looked, and suddenly the Unabomber was flesh and blood.<eos> A man, not a concept, and that's Why this scared you so much. That's why you stopped For six years... hey, hugh?
You seen them college textbooks, man?<eos> Them things is thick as a phonebook.<eos> You know how expensive this is gonna be?<eos> I guarantee you I won't see change from $150,000.<eos> Which is more than me and Renee paid for our first house.<eos> It's a good school, this one that Sammy got into, right?<eos> So it's gonna be a good degree, right?<eos> If it's a good degree, she's probably gonna get a good job.<eos> Hey. Good money, right?<eos> You can guilt that kid into buying you whatever you want.
I promise.<eos> Feel better, Mr. Brown.<eos> Thanks for looking after me, doc.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> You want to do us a favor and tell us what happened here?<eos> I got coldcocked.<eos> The guy came at me from behind.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, presumably,<eos> Harry, the man hit you for some reason.
- So, shortly after we received the proof-of-life photo of Natasha, this comes through.<eos> Nice guy.<eos> Wow.<eos> This keeps getting better and better, doesn't it, Tom, huh?<eos> "Now will you pay?"<eos> You mean, like you didn't before, or what?<eos> It means Tom's been lying to us.<eos> Isn't that right, Tom?<eos> Let me take a crack at this.<eos> The first time those kidnappers called you and said they had your wife, they gave you a where and a when for an exchange, didn't they?
Didn't they, Tom?<eos> All right, I think it's safe to assume that Tom's silence here is confirming that he blew off the first ransom drop.<eos> You degenerate.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We don't do that.<eos> Not usually we don't.<eos> You all right?<eos> This guy wants me to look after his wife, and all the time, he's the cheat.<eos> What happened?<eos> Was Celine onto you, is that what happened?
We're gonna do everything in our power.<eos> You don't, um, understand.<eos> I was the one who told them about Natasha.<eos> All right, listen, to me,<eos> Celine, I'm sure you didn't have an option.<eos> You don't blame yourself now, okay?<eos> Right.<eos> I'm not the only one to blame here.<eos> So now we know what I am worth to you.<eos> Celine, I am so sorry for what I put you through, and for this thing with Natasha, I...
I-I have money!<eos> I have money!<eos> What the hell am I doing here?<eos> For starters,<eos> I wanted you to know what it really feels like to be kidnapped.<eos> To be grabbed, and hooded, and thrown into a trunk of a car.<eos> Was that scary, Celine?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You see, there was something about the way that you were abducted that gnawed at me.<eos> When they put you in the car, they put you in the back and you just cooperated, like a good little girl.
I was married to it.<eos> Love, greed.<eos> Maybe both.<eos> You knew I was tailing you, that's why you acted like a good girl.<eos> You made sure I only saw what you wanted me to see.<eos> The kidnapping, not the boyfriend.<eos> What boyfriend?<eos> Well, Colin Hanson.<eos> Well, if he's not your boyfriend, he's pretty confused.<eos> When we picked him up about an hour ago, outside terminal three, Honolulu International, he was waiting for you.
Fairies have such delicate necks.<eos> You should listen to her, Father.<eos> She always makes good on her promises.<eos> And what about the promise of a mother to a son?<eos> Careful of your emotions, Rumple.<eos> They run strongly in our family...<eos> As Blue is about to find out.<eos> I'm sorry I had to do this, Father.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I'm afraid your magic is no longer any use to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> She has it well-hidden.<eos> - Then we're lost.<eos> - No.<eos> There is something here of use.<eos> The one thing she's afraid of...<eos> You learning her darkest secret.<eos> And what is that?<eos> The reason she gave you up.
Stay back. I got this.<eos> I should have buried you in that dwarf mine.<eos> Yes, but you didn't.<eos> And now, thanks to my sister, your plan is over.<eos> That witch made a fatal mistake... One you're going to have to pay for right now.<eos> Miss me?<eos> You know, this whole driving thing's quite easy when you're actually trying to hit something.<eos> So, what now?<eos> I'm just supposed to stare at this blanket and hope my memories appear?<eos> Your mother doesn't want you to know why she gave you up, so that's exactly what we need to find out.
Wait.<eos> Gold is a Savior?<eos> Rumple, is this true?<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> All these years...<eos> All these years I've known there was a good man behind the beast.<eos> Now you know it, too.<eos> I don't know what I know... but I know I must do this.<eos> Let me help you. I can... No.<eos> I've put you in enough danger.
Let me help you. I can... No.<eos> I've put you in enough danger.<eos> I think it's best that I face my mother alone.<eos> I see you've mended that dreadful thing.<eos> This wand was meant to destroy you... as was I.<eos> You found out.<eos> In some ways, I always knew.<eos> Just needed to remember.<eos> I was meant to be the Savior, Mother.<eos> You were just afraid that I would kill you, and that's why you left me.
Hey, now we got a name for it: "slaughtering the goat."<eos> Sorry.<eos> Private joke.<eos> No, it wasn't remotely private.<eos> Probably wasn't even legal.<eos> Sorry again.<eos> For what it's worth, I'm glad you guys are back together.<eos> Hey, we're fine as long as numbnuts here doesn't text his ex-wife again.<eos> Oh, come on, let's not start this.<eos> I told you, she texted me.
What if he wakes up?<eos> You stick his thumb in your mouth and start over.<eos> You don't wash your hands?<eos> I didn't touch anything.<eos> Anyway, he's seeing her tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you ask him about it?<eos> 'Cause then he'll know I broke into his phone and won't trust me anymore.<eos> - He shouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, but he doesn't know that.<eos> Maybe this relationship with Adam isn't good for you.
I'm still in shock about Yuji.<eos> This is a guy who was favored to win this entire competition, but right now he's close to elimination.<eos> Now, let's not speak too soon, Terry.<eos> Jonas seems to be having some trouble.<eos> Oh, look at him.<eos> He's tied up a little bit.<eos> Well, he's okay. He's okay.<eos> Now, if he goes for this Point Thruster and clears Spinal Descent, he could end Yuji's night right here, right now.<eos> He's just gotta reach out!<eos> This is where flexibility can save you.
In the future, when we go there, we can...<eos> Oh, stop with the future talk!<eos> I can't take it no more.<eos> The future's right here.<eos> I'm sitting in it.<eos> I'm gonna live and die and rot right here in this hell hole!<eos> Hawaii.<eos> Who's gonna make that happen?<eos> Not your useless father, wherever the hell that son of a bitch is.<eos> I'll take you there, like I promised I would.
I mean, I already finished his costume, but I'm not sure Mom will have the energy to go.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, uh, has anyone heard anything about Allison's biopsy?<eos> Yeah, Ken said it went fine.<eos> They're just waiting to hear.<eos> Man, this sucks.<eos> Uh, stuff like this reminds you how short life is.
Yeah, I'm already on that.<eos> I love you, babe.<eos> Will you tell him - wearing sneakers to a formal event isn't - They're fine.<eos> - even close to as cool as he thinks it is?<eos> - They're fine. I'm a little more concerned about the dress. - Exactly.<eos> Right?<eos> - What's wrong with my dress?<eos> Well, it's cold outside.<eos> Dad, it's an homage to André Courrèges.<eos> It's not gonna keep you warm, Noodle.
I don't care about his stupid birthday party.<eos> No. Ma'am, you'll be putting Ashley at risk.<eos> We have to wait until she's gone.<eos> And you let him?<eos> Her mom's the secretary of state.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> You can't take a picture of somebody's state-issued ID.<eos> That's, like, a an invasion of your civil rights.<eos> Whatever. If I was her dad, I'd be paranoid, too.<eos> You should have shown him all those crazy texts she sent you.
That missionary that was kidnapped last year...<eos> Lara Cramer.<eos> Did she...?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have a headache from that driver's cologne.<eos> Sorry you didn't get date raped.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Thad Newton's a jerk.<eos> You're-you're lucky he ditched you.
I don't know.<eos> They-they were talking about meeting with this doctor. Um...<eos> Sanders or Saunders.<eos> What does this doctor do?<eos> Is that where they got the DMT? - I don't know.<eos> - When you had these visions,<eos> - what did you think was happening?<eos> - Like I said, uh, fever, sleep deprivation, but I was able to push through that.<eos> I was in control.<eos> Except they sent you to a shopping mall with a bomb in the back of your truck.
Now, why don't we go and enjoy the party, hmm?<eos> Okay, so, why don't I head over there with you while my colleague whips up that proposal?<eos> Just don't like to let a potential client go.<eos> You don't mind, Alex, do you?<eos> Sure. Of course.<eos> Sure.<eos> Just go easy on my firewall, would you?<eos> I got you, Sean.<eos> Owen and Alex got Sean's finger-scan.<eos> As soon as it gets to you, log into their system and download their trade history.
Why would I withdraw?<eos> Being here is like printing money.<eos> Unless you want to lose out, I'd go all in.<eos> Yeah, but I can't be the only client looking for the exit after this week's windfall.<eos> Excuse me. I have to go.<eos> Emily on the move.<eos> She got a text to go up to GIP's office.<eos> Dayana cleared my mark. I can follow.<eos> She's my mark. I got it.<eos> It's not your mark if she left you behind, Owen.
If there had been a jury, they'd all be dead, too.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but something about Chinese astronauts, Venezuelan toilet bombs, or gold under the pyramids has gotten everyone killed.<eos> We just have to figure out what it was.<eos> That's no mystery.<eos> It was the Venezuelan toilet bomb.<eos> "Library Blast Kills 36 in Caracas on Eve of Election."<eos> You can be forgiven for missing this story.<eos> We were working around the clock to prove Kotite's guilt when this bomb detonated two days ago.<eos> He clearly heard about it, though.<eos> You think that's why Kotite called you the other night. He realized why everyone from his trial was dying.
And you think you can't do that now?<eos> Okay, maybe, maybe.<eos> You know, if you pay off all your credit cards, erase your computer, buy a one-way ticket to someplace far away.<eos> Yeah, I guess...<eos> I guess maybe people do it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You can't erase it all.<eos> Think about it, every purchase you've ever made, every picture you've ever shared, your messages, your comments.<eos> All these facts that are etched in this thing, this network, and barring some catastrophic failure, they'll follow you...
Hey, there any chance you got a...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This doesn't look right, does it?<eos> It's affected, like I'm doing a thing, huh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never met you before.
Mmm. I wish you wouldn't eat during our session.<eos> Oh, me neither.<eos> I'm just... I'm starving.<eos> Ew, worse than the falafel?<eos> Different, but equally bad.<eos> Oh, hey, I meant to tell you. I saw a posting...<eos> they're looking for someone to teach intro to psych at UCLA Extension.<eos> My God, I would be a terrible teacher.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> I would tell the students what a thankless fucking job this is, and not to waste their money learning about things that nobody wants to hear about, even when they're paying you to say 'em.
Then we're done.<eos> Dembe, please.<eos> Please...<eos> Move.<eos> Okay, uh... what is this?<eos> Raymond's. He has lockers like this all around the globe.<eos> You want me to hack it so you can steal from Mr. Reddington.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I did not bring you here to steal from Raymond. I brought you here to find out who already did.
Info's all there.<eos> - Good afternoon, Chuck.<eos> - Yo.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Someone with a schedule that leaves demonstrably less time to hit the gym than you.<eos> Let's see if it's been worth it. - What do you want?<eos> - Richard Fickman.<eos> - He's dead.<eos> - That's unfortunate.<eos> Who put you up to it?
- That's unfortunate.<eos> Who put you up to it?<eos> It wasn't my idea.<eos> Was it the Sanctum Corporation?<eos> - What is Sanctum?<eos> - How did you find him?<eos> Over there.<eos> The folder.<eos> It's a full dossier on Fickman. His movements, past addresses.<eos> Who hired you to kill him?
- You say this Nemec, she's the one who was attacking Reddington?<eos> Dembe seemed to think so.<eos> But she's been missing for 25 years.<eos> Yeah, I cannot explain it, but had you seen Dembe's face when he saw her name...<eos> It was like he'd seen a ghost.<eos> Cooper's sending a team to pick up Dr. Gallup.<eos> He says Aram is safe.<eos> Aram insists Dembe is innocent.<eos> I need to be the judge of that.<eos> He's not the one hurting you.
He does not, but I have to.<eos> And I must insist on your help to do so.<eos> Sometimes he sends me packages.<eos> Pre-paid cellphones with one number saved for emergencies.<eos> When my father told me he moved us here to protect us, I never dreamed he meant to keep us safe from you.<eos> He didn't.<eos> - Are you okay, Isabella?<eos> - Yes, she's okay.<eos> What are you doing there, Raymond?<eos> Trying to find you.
Call her.<eos> She said you'd do this.<eos> She said I'd do what exactly?<eos> Underestimate her.<eos> Baz!<eos> It's me.<eos> Hate to leave this on your machine, but there's something you ought to know.<eos> Your friends, uhm... the black fella and the man in the hat,<eos> Reddington-- they're here.<eos> You said they'd kill me to get you, if this is the last time you hear my voice, know that I didn't give you up. And I didn't go down without a fight.
How long till you steal all his money?<eos> You can pay us then.<eos> - Not exactly how it works. - Oh.<eos> Okay, how about this?<eos> You think you three bozos can keep your shit together for about 30 minutes?<eos> We're not having trouble keeping our shit together.<eos> Precisely, exactly, boom.<eos> Okay, I'm cutting you off.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> - I'm cutting you off.
Max gets here and tells you all about your money.<eos> Good, look forward to that.<eos> - One Alice, made with love.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> So who the hell is Max?<eos> No idea.<eos> Hey, birthday girl.<eos> You know, I'm not even sure I know when your real birthday is.<eos> Max, I've been calling you all day.
- Should I take a seat? - Just...<eos> let me...<eos> - I was gonna say that. - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Uh, have a seat.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So I'm breaking up with you.<eos> I understand.<eos> Can you maybe be a little bit upset?<eos> I just dumped you.
El Paso, last September.<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Then why was her name and number found in your house?<eos> Maybe she gave it to me.<eos> Is that her?<eos> Pretty girl.<eos> No, no.<eos> Her, I'd remember.<eos> Just, not being able to look at a hot piece like that, now, that's torture.<eos> I told you... you don't get to look at her.
- What you got for me?<eos> Yeah, man, you know the dude who owned - the warehouse, Kimball?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, right, right. I understand that, Rashad.<eos> That's why I called you.<eos> Well, he hit me up a couple weeks ago.<eos> Wanted me to take care of a situation for him. You know, turns out, these dudes were trying to shake him for some money.<eos> Wanted me to step in, intervene, - you know, do my thing.<eos> - Okay, wait, wait.<eos> When did I ask you for information - about the warehouse, Rashad?
You killed his daughter in that fire.<eos> I mean, I knew her her whole life. She was... just one of those people, made the world a better place.<eos> I mean, she just... she had a glow.<eos> A chief at CFD, he told me arsonists like to return to the scene of the crime, but I had a real strong hunch you would anyway.<eos> Because I know this crime was personal.<eos> You wanted to hurt someone 'cause someone hurt you.<eos> Tell me if I'm wrong.<eos> Tell me if I'm wrong!<eos> So who was it?<eos> Who pissed you off, huh?
That's what I called him, my Sweet Boy.<eos> I know it's silly.<eos> Was there a time when he stopped being sweet?<eos> Dylan was five.<eos> My brother Frank was taking him fishing.<eos> He was so excited, you know, like little boys get.<eos> When he got home... he was different.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Watch it, young man.<eos> I know what he did to you.
We know you saw him do more than just step on the paper bag.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> He came up to me at the rave.<eos> He said he knew me, that we'd met on the L, like, three months ago. But I had no idea.<eos> He said that he asked me to have a cup of coffee back then.<eos> - Did you go out with him?<eos> - No. I had to study.<eos> That's what he said I told him.<eos> But I swear, I don't remember this at all.<eos> What else did he tell you, Tamra?
- What you got for me?<eos> Yeah, man, you know the dude who owned - the warehouse, Kimball?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, right, right.

All right.<eos> The judgmental one or the pretty one?<eos> They're the same sister.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Well, I always liked her.<eos> I think the feeling was mutual, - so I'm gonna talk you up, girl.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna make you look awesome.<eos> Okay, just in case it comes up, but I'm sure that it won't...<eos> She hates you now.
- Sarah...<eos> - Not to me, it wasn't!<eos> What you did...<eos> - I was sick!<eos> - No, you don't get to say that.<eos> - Calm down, you're in a public place.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> I don't have to calm down.<eos> You won't even admit...<eos> I admitted to you that I was sick!
Calm down, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm sorry, I apologize.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> - I was sick!<eos> - No, you don't get to say that.<eos> Calm down, you're in a public place.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't have to calm down.<eos> You won't even admit...<eos> I admitted to you that I was sick!
You won't even admit...<eos> I admitted to you that I was sick!<eos> - That's not sick!<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - You raped me.<eos> Sarah... I understand why you didn't wanna tell us what was on this video, and I'm so sorry...<eos> But you've gotta understand that, from where I'm sitting, this is enough for Bobby to blackmail your father.<eos> If that's what he was doing, I didn't know.<eos> If you didn't know he was filming you, okay, fine.
What?<eos> He offered me a job, and he wants you to convince me to take it.<eos> - Sold.<eos> - Mission accomplished, Mr. Azoulay.<eos> And he is rerouting his private jet...<eos> - He has a private jet?<eos> - He has a private jet?<eos> Yes, he has a private jet, and he is rerouting it to Van Nuys just in case I can meet him this morning.<eos> Let us recap here.<eos> He runs a billion-dollar empire, he fired the law firm because they did not appreciate you, and he's rerouting his private jet for you?
How'd you not laugh in his face?<eos> Because he's Tito Flores and if you do that he kills your family.<eos> I wanted to go to nursing school, but instead I was Tito's mistress for four years.<eos> How'd you get away?<eos> I got pregnant, and I couldn't let my baby grow up in that life.<eos> My cousin, Carlos, he-he snuck us out, brought us here, put me in touch with the DEA.<eos> It was quiet for months, and then Tito's men found us.<eos> The Dana Point parking lot.<eos> You did good, you kept him safe.<eos> The DEA will be here, and, uh, they're gonna bring you in.
I'm not sure that's true.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Oh, you know, holding a fake baby, sitting in a deserted parking lot, waiting on some cartel guys to come shoot at me.<eos> Roger, is it possible I misunderstood any of those words?<eos> Come on, Rog, don't worry the woman.<eos> Tell her you're wearing a vest.<eos> Riggs said to tell you that I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> What if they shoot you in the head?
They'll see a fire.<eos> You're cold.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You're not fine, you're cold.<eos> Come here.<eos> What? I'm not going to take your honor, Capulet. You're cold.<eos> Come here.<eos> You could have just given me the cloak.<eos> Then I'd be cold.<eos> So, what did Friar Lawrence tell you?
You could have just given me the cloak.<eos> Then I'd be cold.<eos> So, what did Friar Lawrence tell you?<eos> He said, "There are forces at work here greater than you and I combined."<eos> And?<eos> What "and?" That's what he said.<eos> "There are forces at work here greater than you and I combined"?<eos> That's it? That's all?<eos> Yes.<eos> And that single sentence convinced you that the Friar knows who framed you for murder.
"Forces at work" is the entire reason we're outside the city walls, risking our lives in the middle of the night?<eos> That, and if I'd stayed in Verona, I would have been executed for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> I left my home.<eos> I left my sister for this!<eos> Dear God, what have I done?<eos> And... And why, because a Montague said, "Trust me"?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I'm a fool. You didn't want to stay there, either.<eos> Unless you want to go back and marry my uncle...<eos> What I want is to figure out who framed you for murder, and what I want is to make it so you and I don't have to get married.
You're sure the Friar's down there? No.<eos> But this is the only monastery within two days' ride of Verona.<eos> If I'm the Friar, I'm down there.<eos> And you just show up and say "sanctuary," and the monks have to take you in?<eos> So I've heard.<eos> You've heard.<eos> But you don't know for sure.<eos> I've never been accused of murder before, much as that might surprise you.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm afraid they're going to turn you over to the Prince.
You've been in there for ages.<eos> You're worse than a girl.<eos> We can't travel till nightfall.<eos> Or leave this room without risking questions from the farmer.<eos> And I do love a good bath.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Allow me my pleasures, Capulet.<eos> You know as well as I this is most likely the last bath I'll ever take.<eos> I told you I didn't want you to come with me.<eos> And I told you I didn't care.

Ezra, no one would like to believe<eos> General Kenobi's alive more than I would, but Senator Organa confirmed his death.<eos> Maybe he was wrong.<eos> We know Maul went looking for Master Kenobi.<eos> This could be a sign that he's closing in on him.<eos> Or it could just be a broken recording.<eos> That doesn't explain why I heard Maul's voice.<eos> But you've heard it before.<eos> You've heard it before, and it was just a trick.<eos> Maul was manipulating you.
No.<eos> You failed your friends.<eos> No!<eos> You will die!<eos> No!<eos> You're in the wrong place, Ezra Bridger.<eos> Master?<eos> Master Kenobi?<eos> I am.<eos> And when you have your strength, I will help you on your way.
Let's drink to...<eos> Ah... you've already made two toasts.<eos> My turn.<eos> To watching the best chef this side of the country make our capellini.<eos> Dude, it's like watching Mark Zuckerberg code.<eos> Easy. That's sipping tequila.<eos> Hey, I'm paying for it. I decide how to drink it.<eos> To not letting other people tell you how to drink.
For the car.<eos> That you gave me.<eos> Jennifer.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, well, uh, she needs a new paint job and new upholstery.<eos> But I'm gonna replace all the wire, transmission and suspension, rebuild the engine.<eos> Nothing sounds like the growl of a '70s Challenger.<eos> Oh. That only took five years. Well, four.<eos> I think you mourned Charlene for a whole year while Jennifer sat in the garage.<eos> Yeah, well, a gut punch like that takes it out of you.
Then things were great. And now, I'm not sure.<eos> Furniture thing's pretty typical.<eos> How about using a dining room table as firewood?<eos> Is that typical? Maybe not, but I get it.<eos> You know, you got to find a way to cope with the demands of the job.<eos> Even if it means literally burning up your past.<eos> How do you cope?<eos> I talk to Michelle.<eos> She hears it all.<eos> Nothing beats having someone to listen to you who gets it.
Thought they were rousting vagrants when this one stumbled in.<eos> Hey, Erin.<eos> What's up, Dr. Halstead?<eos> Oh, you know, just staying out of trouble.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> So... [clears throat] Abby tracked me down.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> She called me a few times too. All right, so you knew she was in Chicago.<eos> - She's here?<eos> - Yes, she's here. She's looking for you.
Okay.<eos> What did he want?<eos> For me to stay in the trailer.<eos> Juliana, let me ask you, can you picture the man?<eos> Had you ever seen him before?<eos> No.<eos> He put an ad up on Craigslist, a caretaker for his cabin.<eos> I drove up there to meet him, and he locked me up.<eos> I escaped. [chuckles]<eos> Okay, so you got out, and that hiker found you, but you didn't want his help. Why not?
Who was Juliana Parks in contact with before she disappeared?<eos> Who knows her in Indiana?<eos> Who knows her in Chicago?<eos> And get historical locations on her car from NVLS.<eos> On it, boss.<eos> Um, I'll meet you inside.<eos> What are you, signing autographs?<eos> I'll explain later. I'll meet you inside.<eos> Abby, what are you doing here?<eos> Just waiting for you.
Y-you can trace the deposit.<eos> You can trace the call.<eos> Shanee Wallis wasn't reported missing.<eos> Her friend didn't mention anything.<eos> Well, then someone's lying.<eos> But it's not me.<eos> No, it's none of these.<eos> He's older, he's bald.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have said that earlier.<eos> [sighs] Why did he separate you and Shanee?
Soviet intelligence?<eos> There were some documents on the man...<eos> Where's the body? In the woods.<eos> Kate, there are specific ways...<eos> I sealed him in plastic wrap, after I exsanguinated the corpse in the tulip garden to speed the rate of decay.<eos> I buried the rest below the frost line so that the grave won't heave open during the freeze and thaw cycles.<eos> I never expected to have this conversation with you.<eos> What you saw last night...<eos> You might see other things, too.<eos> I told you, I have a pact with your daughter.
I buried the rest below the frost line so that the grave won't heave open during the freeze and thaw cycles.<eos> I never expected to have this conversation with you.<eos> What you saw last night...<eos> You might see other things, too.<eos> I told you, I have a pact with your daughter.<eos> I will do everything in my power to keep her safe.<eos> And her mother.<eos> Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> He went for smokes last night. He didn't come back.<eos> Maybe he ran out on you.
Yes.<eos> Maybe he left them for you. No.<eos> He's a total dick.<eos> He would never leave me his car.<eos> Christ, what the hell is he up to?<eos> Now I gotta go find him.<eos> You do that, dearie.<eos> Do you wanna ask me something, Kate?<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in that uncomfortable position, especially with masha.
So, what's next for you?<eos> You gonna find some more Russians to live with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't think about it right now.<eos> Masha and her family were my whole world for so long.<eos> Well, there are other worlds out there.<eos> My future's in amarillo.<eos> A lot of people sing about amarillo, you know.<eos> George strait, Neil sedaka, rob zombie.<eos> Is that what's leading you there?
Well, I don't want to miss that.<eos> Okay, all right, one last job.<eos> Or you could do something nice for your wives and give up one afternoon for their sake.<eos> Lowell, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> I can't believe that the boys have to miss Lord of the Dance this afternoon.<eos> Why would Adam schedule a meeting on a Saturday?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> From Don.<eos> Well, Adam said the reason they couldn't go is 'cause Don messed up a client's floors and they had to fix them.<eos> That's what he told you?
Yes, we blamed each other, but it's actually kind of your fault.<eos> Okay, i-if this i-is your apology, I'm gonna have to give it a...<eos> Look, when I screw something up, you get madder at me than you would at someone else, because I'm also catching the heat from the baggage of everything I've ever done before.<eos> This is seriously what you're going with?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense.<eos> Okay, when you thought I broke that vase, what popped into your head?<eos> How careless you were.<eos> Which made you think...?<eos> How sometimes you don't stop and think about how what you do affects me.<eos> Which reminded you of...? The delivery room hot dog.
I assume that... that you've kept looking.<eos> Any idea what Noah wanted to talk to you about yet?<eos> What was so important?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I think it had something to do with Terrence Lewis.<eos> He's one of the cadets that Noah was mentoring at the academy.<eos> I started looking more into Noah's Fort MacArthur connections after you left.<eos> What's so special about Lewis?<eos> Uh, Noah had requested the boy's juvenile criminal file, but JAGs can't access a minor's record without a court order.<eos> But A.D.A.s can, and you're thinking that, uh, he called you, hoping you could get him the files?
Thank you so much, Jen.<eos> You know, if you really want to teach this guy a lesson, send him a nice gift basket.<eos> Do you think that would work?<eos> No.<eos> - I don't hear it.<eos> Ugh, it's like the car knows there's a man in here and wants me to look dumb.<eos> Okay, well let's not float that theory in front of the mechanic.<eos> You don't get it, Matt.<eos> You're a straight, white male.<eos> No one has ever talked to you like you're dumb.
Okay?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Ah, the embrace of the prodigal son.<eos> Mi hermano!<eos> It's good to see you!<eos> ÿQue pasa?<eos> Caleb, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm just popping through on my way back from Tulum.<eos> Oh, hey, I got something for you.
A group of rich white men trying to topple democracy.<eos> See, you can't fight fire with fire.<eos> That's exactly what they expect.<eos> I mean, you gotta fight it with kittens or mercury or the concept of time.<eos> Caleb's right.<eos> These people are unpredictable.<eos> Your strategy was helpful for a while, but if it isn't helpful anymore, then we should change tack.<eos> Look, I know what we're up against, which is why I put my presidency on the line.<eos> And if you really believed me when I said that, you wouldn't be here trying to talk me out of it!<eos> Or maybe I was wrong to ask you to run this.
On my way to the lab.<eos> How'd it go last night?<eos> Your... date.<eos> Oh, uh, I...<eos> Sorry, you don't need to...<eos> After you told me about it, I started thinking.<eos> We need to be careful.<eos> Sandstorm feels like it's everywhere.<eos> Shepherd's been watching me since I was a kid.<eos> They used you against me.
Call me back.<eos> Jane bring you up to speed?<eos> We're after Lelantos, the mysterious dark web courier.<eos> Patterson found us some cover identities, so let's go get changed.<eos> Dr. Katz is supposed to be a miracle worker.<eos> Apparently, there's a two-year wait-list to get an appointment unless you know someone, or unless you are someone.<eos> A long time to see a doctor.<eos> Well, Patterson got us to the front of the line.<eos> All right, I'm Chase Frank... a reclusive... trust fund baby.<eos> Won't the doctor know you're not the real Chase Frank when he sees you?
Yeah.<eos> If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does.<eos> Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor.<eos> It's where all the vendors and exhibits are.<eos> Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.<eos> Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"<eos> Okay, now, Th-this is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.<eos> Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm.
The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, "You know,<eos> "you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there's hair growing out of it, that's a mole."<eos> Do you think she's as honest with you?<eos> I should hope so.<eos> When she called me an insensitive jerk, I'd like to think she meant it.<eos> There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.<eos> Yeah, you'd think.<eos> Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.<eos> I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.<eos> Here, let me help you.
I swear to you, I'm fine.<eos> But are you sure?<eos> One thousand percent.<eos> You are not getting rid of me that easy.<eos> Don't even joke.<eos> Should I call Lisa and tell her what's going on with Sam?<eos> Well, I'm not so sure he's ready for Lisa.<eos> What about Zach?<eos> He sided with his mom after the divorce.<eos> Let me talk to Sam and get back to you.
I'm late for class.<eos> Stephen Walker sent us to come get you.<eos> You were down there because of me.<eos> Because I threw away that medicine you were trying to get me to take.<eos> Mom, I did what I did because I wanted to.<eos> You would have run out of medicine eventually, and Scratch would have been waiting.<eos> The same thing would have happened, it just would have taken longer.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Mom, it's not your fault.<eos> I can't believe I'm losing you to this.
You're Lindsey Vaughn.<eos> Um, no.<eos> Carol.<eos> Carol Atkinson.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Your mother's an angel.<eos> So glad you had this time together.<eos> Let's go, Diana.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Lewis: Your brain is playing tricks on you.
Most expensive coffee in the world.<eos> They force strange cat to eat beans, cat shits out coffee.<eos> Sometimes cat dies, cannot be helped.<eos> It's price of doing business.<eos> Riva, I need to know brienne is okay.<eos> Please.<eos> Brienne!<eos> You okay, baby?<eos> You good?<eos> They treating you okay?
Okay, you got to believe me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It'll never happen again. You're right.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> You are sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry!<eos> I love you!<eos> The eye means you see everything... all the details.<eos> Nothing is lost on you.
Go, git! Get out.<eos> Go.<eos> What's... what's going...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.<eos> Listen to me, marnie.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> This thing that happened. Is the best thing that ever happened to you.
To tell him you quit, right?<eos> You paid back the money from the robbery.<eos> - You're out.<eos> - â€­.<eos> You know, part of living an abundant life is cleaning out â€­the negative influences.<eos> Until we find out â€­who killed Roller, I mean, we're just living under one big cloud of negativity.<eos> Well, I'm positive you can get one of Uncle Daddy's thugs to do it.<eos> Jenn, I...<eos> Honey, I got one baby daddy up in prison. I don't need another one.<eos> I married you because you were different.
I'll let you put it in my butt.<eos> Jenn...<eos> I mean it.<eos> Anal once a week.<eos> I will make you fried peanut butter and jelly, also.<eos> Hey, Jennifer, relax, okay?<eos> We're gonna manifest the life we want.<eos> Baby two days ago, you were walking around like a zombie.<eos> Yesterday, you almost blew a man's full head off.<eos> I just feel like a little ass action and a little PBJ will perk you right up.
I just talked all that shit and left my cigarettes inside.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you, china doll?<eos> You're like a goddamn fortune teller without a store front.<eos> "Ooh, roller had problems with his drug dealers."<eos> We needed to say something.<eos> No, you needed to keep your pie hole shut!<eos> And why in the hell did you take $50,000 from his safe?<eos> Because I thought we were supposed to make this look like a robbery, and now it does.<eos> Boom, problem solved.<eos> So your CSI instincts prompted you to be that damn stupid?
I look at this scar every day and remember that, but we got to move on.<eos> Why didn't you let me draw the other testicle on their faces?<eos> I didn't want you to get arrested.<eos> Why... Why would I get arrested?<eos> They're the criminals.<eos> Dean.<eos> I want to do the exercise that the doctor taught us where you repeat after me.<eos> No, no.<eos> - No, yes. - No more exercises.<eos> The doctor told us it was good for you.
Look at me.<eos> Don't tell me you got some girl problems.<eos> No, I'm mad.<eos> I'm rereally mad.<eos> II want to hurt someone.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> If you're mad at someone, you got to confront them.<eos> I drew a picture, â€­and I cut the eyeballs out.<eos> Okay, that's a little too Ted Bundy.<eos> Look, look, Dean, if someone has hurt you...
No, everything's fine.<eos> It's just fine. It's okay.<eos> We'll come back tomorrow.<eos> My.<eos> Little Butterball Desna and Ricky Retardo.<eos> No wonder your poor crackhead mama left you with us.<eos> Let me find out you're still keeping kids.<eos> I'm gonna report your ass.<eos> Hay, hay. They housed us just like hay.<eos> You think anyone's gonna believe you?
Who found them?<eos> Was it Bryce?<eos> Did he do it?<eos> Don't cry, baby, don't cry.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Don't cry. Don't cry.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Deanie, I...<eos> I am so sorry for what they did to you.
Okay, well, if you hear or see anything, here's my card.<eos> So, you grew up here?<eos> Look, I'm just warming up.<eos> Just warming up?<eos> That's like the ninth person.<eos> 10's the charm. 10's the charm... says no one.<eos> You could commit a crime here and not get arrested. - Okay.<eos> - No one could identify you.<eos> No one would pick you out of a lineup.<eos> Yeah, see, this place will put you in the right space.
I wish I was wrong about how similar you and Dax are.<eos> I mean, look, whatever he went through out there, he brought it back home, and now he's... he's dead, and...<eos> I don't want that for you.<eos> Yeah, look, I fought in a war.<eos> Came back shook up. Don't make this a thing. It is a thing.<eos> You can't act like your dishonorable discharge didn't happen.<eos> Not with you around. That's for damn sure.<eos> Look, hanging with you the last few days has been great.<eos> I just wish it wasn't always a long-winded interrogation with you. Damn!<eos> I wasn't interrogating you. I was trying to be a good sister.
that includes you... said that everything was okay.<eos> Our father doesn't need to ask to get involved.<eos> You know, he likes to just get all up in your business, and now he's acting like he's a guest in his own family.<eos> I... I forgot my coat.<eos> Well, maybe Dad is off his game because it feels like we didn't need him on the roster.<eos> All right, Rosie, this is cuckoo bananas.<eos> Is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The divorce... living away from family... I guess I'm just trying to find my way in this new normal.<eos> Well, let me help you out.
Yeah, well, he was my rock.<eos> When it came time for my surgery, I was so scared.<eos> So he gave me a copy of his album... "Steely Blue"... to play in the O.R.<eos> So he wanted you to feel like he was there with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to him? He died during surgery.<eos> And ever since then, I've made it my mission to emulate the light that he gave to the world.<eos> And "Steely Blue" plays during every single surgery I've had.<eos> Anyway... I want you to have it.<eos> I hope it helps you the way it helped me.
So, for those keeping score, you have brought Rosie his album and Gerald to Mom.<eos> So... what you got for Pippy?<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I owe you an apology, Leese.<eos> Oh. No, you don't.<eos> You were right.<eos> I mean, it's okay to put the badge away from time to time and... reconnect with the old neighborhood.<eos> It's just... the museums... the old guys in the park playing dominoes, the... the scent of hand-rolled cigars...<eos> It reminds you of Dad.
Oh. No, you don't.<eos> You were right.<eos> I mean, it's okay to put the badge away from time to time and... reconnect with the old neighborhood.<eos> It's just... the museums... the old guys in the park playing dominoes, the... the scent of hand-rolled cigars...<eos> It reminds you of Dad.<eos> Everything I love about that place is what I miss about him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Guess who I ran into the other day.<eos> Ramon Campos.<eos> The kid who used to bully you in the fourth grade?
- Yeah, we connected.<eos> You know he doesn't do that with everybody, right?<eos> Oh, finally I feel like he's beginning to think there's a place for him here.<eos> - Thank you, Rosie.<eos> - Whatever I can do to help.<eos> But you might want to lock it up with Adrian so you're not home alone in bed having assassination dreams.<eos> Thanny Torres, 32, teacher.<eos> There's the fiancé. I'll go make some small talk.<eos> You do your thing.<eos> What prevented you from getting to that door?
And the three of us better find out what it is before someone else does.<eos> All I'm saying is people could catch me doing weird things on camera, too.<eos> - You're telling me you got no quirks?<eos> - Of course I do... pretzel obsessions, shower-dancing to Shakira... still telling myself pro wrestling is real, not picking up a prostitute from jail and lying to my own team.<eos> Former prostitute...<eos> Maybe there's an explanation.<eos> You know, he did admit to liking when ladies of the night read to him.<eos> But none of them showed up dead with Slade's name all over it.<eos> You need to work on your library voice.<eos> Does this look like a library to you?
He basically paid off my mortgage.<eos> What, like a loan shark?<eos> Like my longest and best-paying customer.<eos> He was a lot rougher than a shark.<eos> He was a very dangerous man.<eos> Are you absolutely certain the man in this photo was your customer?<eos> I may forget faces and names and marriages when I'm asked to.<eos> I'd never forget those eyes.<eos> What was behind them terrified me.<eos> - He terrified you?
So, listen... Call me if you need anything.<eos> I have to see someone.<eos> First time here.<eos> I got to say... This ventilation needs some love.<eos> Nah. Weak ventilation keeps the weak-spirited out... usually.<eos> Lots of alone time... That explains why you're a perfect shot.<eos> Got any advice for a civilian?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Join the Army.<eos> If not, think of somebody who motivates you to hit them dead center every time.
And after he went to jail, you decided to take it over, and you became Amparo.<eos> Wow. That's a really well-crafted story, Slade.<eos> I applaud you.<eos> Now, will someone handcuff this guy already?<eos> No, see, I applaud you, because that Cuban contact I gave you 10 years ago was Ettore Alves, not Estevez Crespo.<eos> Now, that's kind of curious how you knew today's contact even though you had no idea that the ring was still happening.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Whoa. Come on.<eos> What are you guys doing? He's obviously lying.<eos> We were lying when we told you this was a sting on Slade.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.<eos> I want that job at Angel City.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I love my job.<eos> What we do means everything to me.<eos> And right now, I feel like I'm at the top of my game.<eos> And honestly, a lot of that has to do with you, Rosie.<eos> You know, watching the best, it has pushed me, focused me, inspired me.<eos> Thank you for that, but, um...
Oh, my God.<eos> Brad!<eos> Brad!<eos> We are completely alone.<eos> No one came to take you back to lockup!<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Well, I was thinking that my life is pretty much over, but sure, why not?<eos> No, no, not now!<eos> No. No.<eos> I'm busting you out of here.
Jameel and Shinwell, they were tight. Like, inseparable.<eos> But I haven't heard Shin's name since I was a kid.<eos> He got jumped by some other gang back then, and they shot him a bunch of times, then he got sent to Great Meadows.<eos> Yep, that's true, but he's out now and he's getting shot at again.<eos> Most recently, with the same weapon used to kill your brother.<eos> What?<eos> An attempt was made on his life last night and the bullets were a match for the ones used at your mother's apartment 12 years ago.<eos> You think it's the same guy?<eos> I think the crimes are connected.<eos> Now, in this file, it says that, at the time of Jameel's murder, you were asleep in your bedroom, gunfire woke you up, but you didn't see anything.
This obviously isn't your first professional work, Mr. Vennek.<eos> Would I be right in thinking that your incarceration might worry some of your previous employers?<eos> So now would be a very good time to think about avoiding general population.<eos> My helper's name was D'Agostino.<eos> Mr. Azoff... is at the bottom of Jamaica Bay.<eos> I bleached down his truck and had it dismantled at a chop shop.<eos> I'll give you their address, too.<eos> It's just business.<eos> Didn't sound like it when you were killing Azoff.<eos> Hmm. Some customers ask you to go easy, others want you to make it hard.
Ma, that's nothing!<eos> _<eos> Agreed, but there are steps in between.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay, so let's change that.<eos> - A sexy dress... - Oh. Some heels, a little makeup.<eos> Come on, you've been in the friend zone too long.<eos> Trust me.<eos> When Jorge sees you next, he's gonna say...
What?<eos> No winking.<eos> Flirting with the jury is pretty frowned upon.<eos> Sorry, it was just instinct.<eos> Let's take your testimony from the top.<eos> Ah, it's Xiomara.<eos> Hello?<eos> How dare you? !<eos> You have no right to talk about my relationship with Bruce to Mateo.<eos> What could possibly possess you to talk to a four-year-old about this?
Look,I knowit wasalong time ago, but I can't help it.<eos> Jane just makes me feel like a bad mom who has to ask stupid questions, like how to deal with diaper rash.<eos> Well, then you just have to remind yourself that you're no longer that person.<eos> I mean, you're the dragon.<eos> You saw the picture?<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They clearly think I'm scary.<eos> No, they think you're a dragon because last week, when they were having nightmares, I told them they had nothing to be scared of because they lived with the fiercest woman I know.<eos> You protect everyone around you. Like a dragon.
- He doesn't.<eos> - Where's my raincoat?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I need it for show-and-tell, and it has indoor pockets.<eos> Mommy said she'd find it!<eos> Calm down, Mateo.<eos> I've looked for it everywhere, and it's not here, but I will find it and drop it off, okay? I promise.<eos> Now go get yourself dressed.<eos> Mommy has to get to work, and Abuela's gonna drop you off at school.
Hoodie, three o'clock. - Mr. Robot?<eos> - Okay, who do you like, then?<eos> It doesn't matter, because no one's looking.<eos> Because it looks like you two are together.<eos> Look, we have to make it clear that Jane is the third wheel here.<eos> Come here, Rafael.<eos> Now I'm gonna put my head here.<eos> Great.<eos> Look over there.<eos> Tall drink of water, blue shirt, cute, and he's looking at you.
I guess the sprinklers are just on timers.<eos> - So, what time does Anezka get in?<eos> - Noon.<eos> Okay, girls.<eos> Have a great day at school.<eos> I'll come get you after martial arts.<eos> ELLIE: Bye, Mommy.<eos> Okay, come on. Come on.<eos> (chuckles) Call me if you need anything.<eos> Okay, so, when are we gonna have a talk about the fact that your ex still has the hots for you?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> So, you're saying this woman whose apartment you were arrested in, just happened to be drowning right in front of you?<eos> - Correct. - Right where somebody<eos> - just happened to be trying to kill you.<eos> - Yeah, I know, it's insane, live with it.<eos> She's a suicide risk.<eos> Because of what happened to her daughter.<eos> Given the fact that her husband put my brother on death row, it's a little awkward to inquire directly.<eos> So, I thought maybe you could find out if she's okay.<eos> You don't want us to talk to the people who tied you to a concrete block?
Yeah.<eos> A lot of days late and a lot of dollars short.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> Did mom's car get in an accident?<eos> - No!<eos> - DidDid Ruby get hurt?<eos> Nothing like that.<eos> Just wanted to see you.<eos> Why didn't you come before?<eos> Man, you know, sometimes, it's like you're asleep and something wakes you up, you know.
I thought she came back to tell me she was okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It looks like a regular, normal pen, right? Wrong!<eos> It's a laser death ray.<eos> He's getting away.<eos> You saved her.<eos> Is she free? - You're hurt.<eos> - I'm all right.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I put a tracker on you in the club.
I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I just wanted to find out what happened.<eos> Haven't you asked Sam?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My wife told you the rest,<eos> - so what more is there to discuss?<eos> Just five minutes.<eos> I thought he was going to give me another diving lesson.<eos> I should have taken the hint.<eos> So he pushed you in the shower in your uniform.
I'm afraid not.<eos> Not without an appointment.<eos> Is it all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> So is it just the two of you, Christmas Day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know what it will be like this year.<eos> - Sam's...<eos> - Putting you through it a bit still?
- I should've known.<eos> - She knew you were on her side.<eos> She was a bloody good nurse.<eos> I don't even think she did anything wrong.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm really sorry about Cathy.<eos> Oh, it's Sam.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Are you sure you're all right?<eos> - Do you want me to drive you home?
Well, I could see she wasn't the most popular.<eos> Is jasmine popular?<eos> Yeah. I'd say so.<eos> Very, actually.<eos> It's always the popular ones who think they can get away with murder.<eos> Spoken like a true scientist.<eos> Trust me, I just know.<eos> We should get jasmine in there now.<eos> So you two go back a ways?<eos> Well, I'm sure terry's told you all about it.
Ladies.<eos> Sweeping away old memories.<eos> You sure you want to throw these away?<eos> Yup.<eos> What can I do for you, Agent DiNozzo?<eos> I was just wondering if your husband ever talked about what happened overseas?<eos> You know, other Marines in his squad?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Never talked to you about getting beat up or poisoned?
I'll get samples from her room and the restaurant.<eos> Talk to our little gossip girl.<eos> You need to know exactly where she's been and what she's done in the last 24 hours.<eos> Oh, I think-<eos> Welcome to the convention, Dr. Perlmutter.<eos> It's my 25th consecutive year.<eos> Perlmutter loves the '80s.<eos> Do you need me to leave too?<eos> You might remember stuff she doesn't.<eos> We didn't do anything we haven't told you about.
How can you not believe me?<eos> Turn to your right.<eos> Mr. Keener, I really appreciate you coming.<eos> Oh, it's not that much of a hike.<eos> My room's only six floors up.<eos> Last night, do you remember two girls, about 16?<eos> That table right there.<eos> They made an impression.<eos> Well, they were hard to miss with the giggling and the staring.<eos> I'm sure that happens to you a lot.
you love the spotlight. i promised an exlcusive to buy us time.<eos> This was all about getting back at cal and the lightman group, wasn't it?<eos> gillian... you know me too well.<eos> it was fun.<eos> bye, jack.<eos> here's my card.<eos> in case you plan on making a life change.<eos> thanks, man.<eos> Well, it's been a very tense time, but the threat has been eliminated.<eos> Dr. Cho credits you with helping a little boy with sickle cell anemia.
You're charging me with a crime.<eos> Seems like one's been committed.<eos> Ship looks like a war zone.<eos> Jordanian flagship.<eos> It is not your jurisdiction.<eos> You are my jurisdiction.<eos> At least, you want to be.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> For the record, the U.S. Marine among the dead... that makes it my business.<eos> For the record, I have not yet charged you with a crime.
That I would ever let you down like that.<eos> Well, actually, Senator Clemente, the F.O.A., the E.P.A. and the C.D.C. have all ruled out psychotropic pharmaceuticals in the global water supply as the potential cause of the consciousness shift.<eos> An alien intelligence may have been at work here, yes.<eos> That's what we're thinking.<eos> China.<eos> Can you elaborate, Director Keller?<eos> China's population numbers 1.3 billion. Yet they suffered fatalities of less than half a percent during the blackout.<eos> No mystery.<eos> When the blackout happened, it was 2:00 in the morning over there.<eos> Everybody was asleep. That doesn't strike you as a bit convenient?
Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there.<eos> Look, this is not personal.<eos> We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.<eos> I think you're rude.<eos> And I think you've been rude since you came here.<eos> And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!<eos> Hey!<eos> Do not disrespect Chavez. (CLICKING TONGUE)<eos> Stupid Chavez.<eos> I just told you not to disrespect him.
Why?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Watching.<eos> Observing.<eos> We refer to him as the Observer.<eos> We were dead, Peter.<eos> Until someone grabbed me.<eos> We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met.<eos> You talk to him?<eos> He wouldn't be any use to you.
Well I'm thrilled he changed your mind.<eos> Of course we'd still love to have you give the toast.<eos> Yes, there was another girl, but we hadn't fully committed to her.<eos> We definitely want you. Great.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Ellis.<eos> Goodbye, jet lag. Hello, triple ristretto. Yes.<eos> What was that?<eos> Just a surprise.<eos> And something tells me we're in for a show.<eos> Now, Ms. Waldorf, if this is about letting you give the freshman toast, like I told you last week, I'd love to help you out, but...
You step out of my room Here I am, Dooley!<eos> Back off, man!<eos> We're grieving, you clown!<eos> - Why don't you back up?<eos> ! - You make me, pissant.<eos> How is that feel? - Nicely done.<eos> - You're under arrest.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Sir, let me get this straight.<eos> The victim's wife is Donna Hines, and it was her brother Rod Gerber that told you to step back. Is that right?
- What?<eos> No "thank you, larry,<eos> For saving my life"? Saving my life?<eos> How'd you save my life?<eos> - You didn't save my life.<eos> - I diagnosed your illness.<eos> All right. Well, it's treated, and i'm feeling great.<eos> - Give it up, man.<eos> - Give what up?<eos> What kind of person doesn't say thank you to another person for saving their life?
Then don't.<eos> We have two conflicting visions.<eos> We can choose which one we wanna believe in.<eos> I choose hope.<eos> You're right.<eos> Thanks for coming out, Mike.<eos> Is everything all right, sir?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> That's why I called you out, actually.<eos> I thought you might be upset with me, sir, for... telling you what I told you.
What if it was about the book?<eos> Wasn't Bedford managing the sale of Rockland's rare book collection, the one with our book in it?<eos> Till it got stolen and ended up with us. So you think that Bedford knew about the book, then?<eos> I'm sure the shadows did.<eos> There must be some reason why they don't want you talking to him.<eos> Oh, if the wrong people got a hold of that thing... Bedford's president now. He'd have total control over it.<eos> Maybe that's what he's been after all along.<eos> You want to tell me why you're going around asking questions about me and Tina Clark?<eos> And the day after you're asking these questions, it's in the news that she's dead?<eos> Doesn't that sound strange to you?
Lost.<eos> And then I was...<eos> Take your time.<eos> Walking.<eos> And now I'm here in this room.<eos> In this tiny room and...<eos> Captain, can you do me a favour and unlock these cuffs? No.<eos> I don't make a habit of locking myself in with unrestrained lunatics.<eos> Then can you leave me your keys on the way out?<eos> Let's clean you up, get you some clothes.
What does that mean?<eos> They corroborated your story.<eos> Blue car, gunshots... and the crime-scene guys extracted two.38 slugs from the hillside.<eos> That your way of saying the case is closed?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> That mean I still have a job?<eos> That means we both still have jobs.<eos> So tell me... what really happened out there?<eos> I told you.
You have x-ray eyes.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> Jane?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Snake and Scotty are about to pitch. We can't miss that.<eos> Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Mrs. Sloop?<eos> I'm with my son.<eos> Mrs. Sloop, I'm sorry. We need to talk to you about your husband.
Big guy like me, but bigger?<eos> Dad, can we go home now?<eos> I'm gonna miss "power rangers."<eos> Well, it- - It's gonna record, buddy,<eos> And we're getting yummies right now.<eos> - Okay, how about this?<eos> - It's a hamburger.<eos> Yeah, it's one of your hamburgers.<eos> I mean, just look.<eos> Maybe there's something - That can tell you where it's from, or who made it.
- Racine, got it.<eos> Come on, buddy. Daddy just got a break in the case.<eos> Okay, candace, see what y can do.<eos> Hey, the, uh, foreman at the construction site<eos> Thinks our doe might've been a welder - Who stopped showing up at work about a month ago.<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, this is where a welder might've had his last meal.<eos> - Welcome to the original nate's.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Does, uh, this man look familiar at all to you?
For the patient.<eos> Mr. Sinha, the patient is coming on the second floor.<eos> You are going towards the first floor.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Doctor, he has grown old, so, he has become forgetful!<eos> Come on, Mr. Sinha.<eos> -Come on.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> The patient is waiting for you on the second floor.<eos> Come on. Go. - Dr. Sneha, something is being hidden from you?
Don't say that.Don't even put that out in the air.<eos> Well,it would explain your reticence.<eos> Why haven't you gone to see the estimable Dr.Sweets for help?<eos> 'Cause I can't go to him.He works for the FBI,all right.<eos> All right.I'll-I'll tag along,and I'll see what I think.<eos> Oh,no,no.I-I thought maybe you could just,you know,hypnotize me,give one of those blue pills.<eos> One quibble: It's "chef" not "cook.<eos> " Chef,all right.<eos> May seem rather a picayune detail to you,but it's quite meaningful to me.<eos> So,did Booth tell you about the plumbing?
I know why you're here.<eos> Agent Booth left my office and immediately went to you,didn't he?<eos> No,I'm-I'm all right with it.<eos> There have been a few changes in Booth.<eos> Since the brain tumor?<eos> Is that why he came to you?<eos> He doesn't trust me?<eos> Oh,right.How could I forgot about cook/client privilege?<eos> Chef/client privileges.<eos> Has he also told you about how now when he climbs stairs, he leads with his right foot rather than his left?
He was doing it for you,wasn't he,Nicole?<eos> How long were you and Bryce seeing each other behind your husband's back?<eos> Since always.<eos> Since high school.<eos> I wrote Bryce in prison,and I told him that we had to stop.<eos> But when he got out on parole,he begged me to choose him.<eos> Got it in his head that to get me to himself,he had to be a better provider than his brother.<eos> Are you going to tell Derek about us?<eos> No.No,I'm not going to say anything to him.<eos> But I will tell you that if you've been in love with another man for ten years, your husband knows.
- Oh, I'm afraid Department 44 personnel are not allowed to carry identification.<eos> For reasons that cannot be specified at this time.<eos> I can give you a number to call for verification.<eos> What exactly is Department 44?<eos> Oh, I'm not allowed to describe or to share our current responsibilities. For reasons that cannot be specified at this time.<eos> I can tell you, however, Department 44 was originally established in 1863... during the Civil War... in response to widespread profiteering of military property. The theft and black market sale of rations, boots, cannon wheels, that sort of thing.<eos> So, why are you here?<eos> Well, this incident involves military property.<eos> I was hoping you'd be so kind as to allow me to monitor the FBI investigation.<eos> We're going to have to get back to you on that one.
Maybe she decided to take off to chigo instead.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Henry said she started using drugs again--heroin,I think.<eos> Well,that would explainthe parts of town where he was looking for her.<eos> I think he was gonna appeal the custody judgment and take claire away from her.<eos> For something that wasn't a case, you know the facts pretty well.<eos> Henry and i got to be pretty close.<eos> I just wish there was more I could have done.<eos> He was in here every day. He was calm at fst,buthen-- the longer his daughter was missing, the more agitated he got.<eos> He didn't believe you when you said your handswere tied, he didn't understd how you didn't have the same urgency he did or why you couldn't sense his pain.
It was proof he didn't kill the woman he went to jail for murdering.<eos> But he confessed.<eos> Well, he might have confessed, but he didn't do it.<eos> With all due respect, Mrs. Thompson, half the men in prison will swear up and down they didn't do it.<eos> Do those men's wives get a package in the mail every month with $7,000 cash in it?<eos> (Castle) Uh, your husband confessed to a murder he didn't commit for money?<eos> I know this will sound crazy, but we didn't know what else to do.<eos> Jared was born with a rare respiratory disease, and we didn't have the money or the insurance to get him the therapy he needed.<eos> If Brady hadn't done what he did, Jared wouldn't even be alive right now.<eos> Did Brady ever tell you who actually committed the murder he went away for?
How'd you pull it off, sir?<eos> They didn't make me Captain just because I look good behind a desk.<eos> Run all the guards on that roster.<eos> Look for anything out of the ordinary.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna call the cemetery to make arrangements to exhume the body tomorrow.<eos> You know what I don't get?<eos> whoever's behind this, why'd he stop paying Brady?<eos> These Wellesleys have plenty of money.<eos> If the money hadn't stopped, Brady never would've set off this triggering domino that started all this.<eos> Let me let you in on a little secret.
I just... did it.<eos> And... now I'm here.<eos> Have you told your family, your colleagues, about your illness? My family's been through enough, Dr. Flemming.<eos> With my dad dying of lung cancer for three years...<eos> - [Flemming] What about your colleagues?<eos> - Surely they would understand.<eos> - [Bryce] I don't want their pity.<eos> Pity?<eos> Bryce.<eos> You need support right now. That's what's gonna get you through this. Nothing's gonna get me through this.
I'll be sure to watch.<eos> Oh, we'll all be watching.<eos> So just how much danger is she in?<eos> A former active once made a passing reference to us In his blog.<eos> That was his last entry.<eos> So going before the United States senate-- That would be worse.<eos> Considerably.<eos> We can't just sit by and let this happen.<eos> I have no intention of just sitting by.<eos> He told you to do nothing.
Oh, no, he did... he called me this morning.<eos> She's throwing some kind of cocktail party. Ostensibly, we're gonna stop her from ung paper napkins, but still...<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah. So I have to put Jamie out of my mind, completely, end of story, because look what happened to you.<eos> You went after some shiny pretty boy and got stuck with nothing.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Thank you. I just mean, I can't let myself get distracted by rock-hard abs and thighs that have driven countries to war.<eos> Okay, what country has ever been driven to war over thighs?<eos> Look, I'm sorry that the agency double-booked you, but I really...
- He found out what Sam was up to.<eos> And decided to take out the trash.<eos> BECKETT: Mr. DePetro, I can understand the instinct of protection.<eos> If I had a sister, and her husband was cheating on her, - I'd want to set him straight, too.<eos> - That's not why I left the message.<eos> Did you know that Sam was cheating on Helen?<eos> Not until she called me last night and told me he'd been killed.<eos> Then what did you mean when you said, - "I won't let you get away with this"?<eos> - He owed me money.<eos> So, Sam borrowed money from you? Twenty Gs.
So when my engineers tried to fill in the blanks and test them, we failed every time.<eos> Finally, we ran out of money, so a couple of months ago, I had to cut Sam loose.<eos> If Sam wasn't working for you, what was he calling about?<eos> He said he needed to show me something.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I drove into the city to meet him at his apartment, but as I pulled up, there were cops all over the entrance.<eos> I got a bad feeling about it, so I turned around, and I drove home.<eos> That's a very interesting story, Mr. Berman, but I have a different ending.<eos> One where you went upstairs to Sam's apartment, and he told you that he finally found the real thing.
This is a copy of your real driver's license, and this is your Social Security card.<eos> And this is the employment record from New York Recycle under an assumed identity.<eos> - Nothing like a fresh start.<eos> - We did a little digging.<eos> Turns out, New York Recycle isn't the first company you've worked for under a new identity.<eos> - A girl's gotta make a living.<eos> - Here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Lance Carlberg figured out that Sam was a spy.<eos> He contacted you, an expert in corporate espionage,<eos> - and asked you to intercept him.
Nobody will talk to me.<eos> Doctor hasn't even been in to see Tommy yet.<eos> You look like you could use a break.There's a pretty decent vending machine down the hallway.<eos> Why don't you go grab something? - I'll stay with your brother.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. Baker.I'm Nick Stokes.<eos> I'm a crime scene investigator.<eos> I'm here to photograph your injuries,collect trace and... later,I'll take your clothes from you.

I mean, if it was me, I would much prefer a highly decorated fbi agent as a witness.<eos> Did you have mark mclaughlin killed?<eos> Are you people on drugs?<eos> Did you have any idea he was about to be murdered?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Thank you. now get back in there with that marshal.<eos> He's a puppet. i'm much more interested<eos> In the guy who's pulling the strings.<eos> You want me to get you in front of elliot greene?
Well, i'm more concerned about why he's refusing to testify.<eos> I wish i could help you, but we haven't spoken since he was reassigned, And they didn't even tell me where.<eos> You were his only lifeline to the outside world When he was undercover. You must have some insights.<eos> I just found out that he's refusing to testify, And it shocked me.<eos> it's not like him.<eos> He's a model agent.<eos> the gold standard.<eos> Model agent, gold standard.<eos> You're lavishing all sorts of praise on him, But you don't act very concerned.<eos> Let me clue you in about what it's like For people to work together undercover.
Once we start down the road of choosing characteristics for our children, i don't--I don't know where that ends.<eos> It's not something that our practice does.<eos> I do want to work with you.I do.But,um...<eos> Your daughter?<eos> She's very pretty.She looks just like you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know,i-I-I nevereally see the resemblance,but,uh--<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> You take it for granted--Having a child that looks like you.<eos> But what if someone had told you you couldn't have your daughter, your own daughter,who's like you in so many ways?
In the bathroom.<eos> Bring me that suicide note.<eos> It's a suicide note.<eos> But it's written on a talisman.<eos> Your sister's name is So-jin, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> "So-jin, I'm sorry." - Her name is Kim Jung-mi, age 27.<eos> But...<eos> She was supposedly close to your sister, but you don't know who she is?<eos> I told you that I don't know her.
- Didn't work.<eos> She hasn't been wiped for months.<eos> The wipes just push everything down. But it all surfaces again.<eos> - And now she can control what and when.<eos> - She can control?<eos> What does that make her?<eos> What is she?<eos> Mr. Ballard.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> I know that the exhaustive health screenings I've been running on Echo seem misguided to you.
Echo?<eos> If it was funny, I want to take credit for it.<eos> I don't think this was funny.<eos> Ms. Lonelyhearts was dumped by Roger this evening.<eos> Are you sure the dementia hasn't gotten to her?<eos> Stop being cute.<eos> How long have you known the identity of Ms. Lonelyhearts?<eos> You?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What have I said to you about her?
He hasn't been here.<eos> He didn't tell me that.<eos> So you talked to him?<eos> Why would anyone want to hurt Augie?<eos> L.A. Detention Center.<eos> Okay. He wasn't here long.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> I told him to go back to New Jersey, but who listens to me?<eos> What did he say?<eos> What did he tell you?
Was this a misunderstanding, as well?<eos> It's a signed statement from the super at Preswick's building, admitting that he took a $ 1,000 bribe from you to allow you into Jeremy's apartment so that you could switch out the paintings.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Should've come clean from the start.<eos> Fink wanted the painting.<eos> He told me to buy it from Preswick, but the guy wouldn't sell.<eos> So Fink had me paint a fake and, yeah, I bribed the super to switch it with the real thing.<eos> It was stupid, but Fink threatened to fire me if I didn't.<eos> It was all you, Darius.<eos> You switched out the paintings, you pocketed the money that Fink gave you to buy it.
He solved the case.<eos> He spotted the killer's car and realized he had just found the most wanted man in California.<eos> But DiMarco didn't care about fame.<eos> He was after the fortune.<eos> The reward money.<eos> He had a problem, he worked for the police force, which meant that he wasn't eligible to collect the reward.<eos> He needed a partner.<eos> A front man.<eos> That's where you came in.<eos> And he told you who the killer was, and all you had to do was come up with a story and collect the money.
Nobody here is really paying attention to us.<eos> That's weird.<eos> That's better.<eos> All right. Let's head out!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Hey, assholes!<eos> You guys know that... everyone thinks you're total fags, right?<eos> What did you say?<eos> {\*You know, }When {\*people like }you drive down the streets with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're {\*all }cool, everyone is {\*actually }laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots.
Let me replay that.<eos> What?<eos> When you asked him if he had a bomb, the left side of his lip tightened.<eos> It's contempt.<eos> He's being deceptive.<eos> So you're giving us the green light.<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> Why is it always red light, green light?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Pull the trigger for you? Wait, wait, let me explain something to you.
You know damn well what happened.<eos> I got the babysitter pregnant.<eos> Then, when she was in the delivery room, I had sex with not one But four nurses in a supply closet.<eos> As well as a woman whose husband Was getting a liver transplant.<eos> Now, which one of them told you?<eos> Was it the liver lady?<eos> - Well, I--no one-- I haven't-- I haven't heard any of this ever in my whole life.<eos> - Believe me, I would have remembered this. - Okay.<eos> Well, in that case,<eos> Everything I just told you was just a funny prank.
The police already went through everything.<eos> Nothing here that will bring him back.<eos> You have any idea who may have wanted to hurt your son?<eos> I'd like to say my son didn't have any enemies, but... I wasn't close enough to him to know.<eos> You had a falling out?<eos> No, just working a lot.<eos> Trying to make sure my family was taken care of.<eos> One day you're missing Little League, and the next thing you know, they're moving out.<eos> And all that time in between... it's just lost.<eos> Did Asher ever talk to you about his time in the marines, or school?
Jonas Stern does not have dementia.<eos> Mr. Stern, you're facing jail time.<eos> I know that.<eos> Your condition is your defense.<eos> This isn't a DUI.<eos> There is no condition!<eos> I'll be damned if I'm gonna have people think that Jonas Stern is losing his mind!<eos> There are three people who know what you know.<eos> One is my doctor, the second one is me, and the third is now covered by attorney-client privilege.<eos> And as your client, I am ordering you not to breathe a word of this.
Captain Raydor seems to hold you in high esteem.<eos> As I do her.<eos> I was just wondering which one of my investigations would've bumped up against something in Major Crimes.<eos> All right, then, let's be direct, because I appreciate direct and I see here that you have completed our domestic-violence seminar.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Detective, first thing I wanna do is assure you that this interview is entirely confidential.<eos> - Nothing you say here will leave this room.<eos> - Fine.<eos> All right then, so how are things at home?<eos> - Captain Raydor spoke to you?
A white male, 30 to 40, 6'3" or more. Pointing a gun at a woman on the floor at his feet. - Then what?<eos> - I ordered the guy to drop the gun.<eos> He turned and fired at me, so I returned fire.<eos> He kept moving toward me, I fired again.<eos> He hit the floor, I kicked the gun out of his hand.<eos> That's when I cleared the house.<eos> I saw the victim had a bloody gash on her head, so I called paramedics.<eos> And Detective Moore's state of mind?<eos> Well, she kept screaming at me for shooting her husband.<eos> Screaming at you for shooting her husband.
I said you would be shot three times.<eos> Shots at close range.<eos> Which means I probably know my killer.<eos> In fact, you do.<eos> He is sitting at this table right now.<eos> You, Agent Benford.<eos> You will kill Agent Noh on March 15th, with the very gun I assume you're carrying right now.<eos> A SIG-Sauer model P226.<eos> In the call you said you didn't know who killed me.<eos> I lied because I didn't want to bring about the incident which I told you about.
Next year, every hayseed in America is going to be plopping down 20 grand to enter.<eos> I didn't bring Abe back to Vegas.<eos> See, you hired me as a lie expert, and then you lied to me.<eos> Double it.<eos> Medium triple latte.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How long you been watching that?<eos> Mm. Not long.<eos> I lied.<eos> She likes you.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, be in my office tomorrow morning at 9:00.<eos> I'm sure we can figure something out.<eos> I don't know if I like the sound of that laugh.<eos> I knew I didn't like the sound of that laugh.<eos> Peter, this is unacceptable.<eos> What gives you the right to treat me like this?<eos> You've been treating me like crap for twenty years, Mr. Pewterschmidt, and now I'm the one in charge.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Clean that up.<eos> Carter, as your boss, I command you to have a viewing party for tonight's episode of The Big Bang Theory, and you have to go cubicle to cubicle inviting people.
Whatcha reading?<eos> What are you reading?<eos> [Krylov's Fables] Uhh...a book.<eos> What?<eos> Right.<eos> It is time to elect a new chairman for Afstaða.<eos> Ingvi wants to continue serving as the chairman, so if nobody runs against him, he wins by default.<eos> The chairman of Afstaða must not violate any rules, The chairman of Afstaða must not violate any rules, or he will lose the chairman position instantly.<eos> I assure you that I will adhere strictly to the rules.<eos> And if Friðjón had actually delivered a letter to you, as he promised, then-
No, we don't.<eos> Yes, let's go take a look in the storage.<eos> Excuse us while you work.<eos> Nothing unusual, right?<eos> Keep up the good work.<eos> Pull it up.<eos> Okay, on to the next one.<eos> Let's take a look over there.<eos> Why is this one empty?<eos> As I told you, the fishing wasn't good so we had none to put in here.
That bratty kid?<eos> Grandmother's grandson?<eos> I think you're acting weird.<eos> When did you two end up on the same road?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> If it's not, then why did he wake up bright and early to bring over your bike, and leave a necklace too?<eos> Why did you cry when you saw it?<eos> Because that person believes me.<eos> That's why I feel so thankful.<eos> A man that has no connection to you, trusts you, and comforts you, all of the women in Seoul would cry and throw a tantrum.
Mom, you haven't attained what you wanted.<eos> Mom. We really can't do anything now.<eos> Eun Sung doesn't say anything.<eos> And we keep Father hidden.<eos> We can't do anything else.<eos> In contrast, Eun Sung receives Grandmother's fortune, and doesn't say anything she's better off not knowing anything.<eos> You are 10 minutes late.<eos> It's only 10 minutes.<eos> After I got that lecture yesterday, it's a miracle that I woke up at this time!<eos> So what did I tell you?

More precisely, a German soldier.<eos> Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.<eos> But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.<eos> The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.<eos> But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.<eos> Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.<eos> It's a hostile world, indeed.<eos> If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?<eos> I suppose I would.<eos> Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?

I'm a detective.<eos> A damn good detective.<eos> Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.<eos> And, yes, some of them were Jews.<eos> J ust a name that stuck.<eos> Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.<eos> Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?<eos> Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?<eos> What do you mean the Little Man?<eos> Germans' nickname for you.
Yeah ,we rolled back on the same bus<eos> OK<eos> This is her driver's licence<eos> Her name is Sarah Mathews<eos> She lives in Boston<eos> He calls his employees ?<eos> Yeah<eos> Hello Norma<eos> Hello<eos> Did your husband tell you where he was going this morning ?
Yeah<eos> Hello Norma<eos> Hello<eos> Did your husband tell you where he was going this morning ?<eos> No ,he didn't<eos> I hope for your (husband) is playing a detective again<eos> Though I insure you I know where he is<eos> Because your employees ?<eos> Is Dana one of your employees ?<eos> As I told you ,I have many employees
I'm headed for Davidstown.<eos> That's what.<eos> I need to warn everyone.<eos> You think you'll reach Davidstown in advance of the Black Freighter?<eos> Isolation has made you mad, captain.<eos> Mad, indeed.<eos> But we must try.<eos> You are a fool.<eos> You alone survived the Freighter's attack.<eos> Fortune has smiled upon you, and you spit in its face.
How funny.<eos> I have a son named Henry. But he's just 3.<eos> I met a girl. And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time. Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.<eos> I'm really glad I met you.<eos> I'm glad I met you too.<eos> Make sure that girl knows how you feel about her.<eos> Your son loves you very much.
I'm Dr. Feldheim.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> Nemo Nobody.<eos> That's an unusual name, don't you think?<eos> Sometimes, people call me Mr. Craft.<eos> Who?<eos> C-R-A-F-T.<eos> Can't Remember A Fucking Thing.<eos> What was the first question I asked you?
Ow!<eos> Ow!<eos> Stop!<eos> And then Zoe just storms off.<eos> I mean, she's really... a very difficult specimen to read sometimes.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> But I...<eos> You just can't act like that if you wanna be one of the guys.<eos> Maybe... she doesn't wanna be one of the guys.<eos> She likes you.
And it kept repeating it over and over.<eos> "An old trunk" or "in an old trunk" as if to suggest that I...<eos> Bryan, is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How well can you hear through a door?<eos> Pretty well, I guess.<eos> Okay, now, what was the volume like?<eos> Like I'm talking now?<eos> Maybe a little lower.<eos> You know, I'm gonna tell you what you did, and I don't want you to get embarrassed, because you're not the first.
What happened last night, I think, is that I've been so sleep deprived from months of insomnia that when I mixed in the alcohol and the sedatives, I made myself unstable.<eos> You know, my doctor's already confirmed that insomnia alone can cause transitory psychotic symptoms, so... My God.<eos> You are one diehard rationalist.<eos> Well, what the hell's the alternative?<eos> Dolls come to life?<eos> No, they can be possessed.<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> Bryan, you're not crazy.<eos> You're not the type.<eos> Something supernatural is happening to you.
- You're not entitled to welfare— - I'm doing this.<eos> ...assistance that comes in any way out of my pocket.<eos> Well, then, reach down in your pants... grab a double handful of balls and do it right. Freeloader, got it!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Martin?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Dale Martin?<eos> The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express his deep regret... that your son, Specialist Eric Martin, was killed in action yesterday... in southern Iraq by sniper fire.<eos> You will receive a more complete report as soon as possible, sir. What we can tell you right now is that his platoon came under sniper fire... and it was an instant death.
But that was another life.<eos> A life I will deprive you of, just like I did your father.<eos> Captain Nero.<eos> The Vulcan ship has been taken. The drill has been destroyed.<eos> Spock!<eos> - Open a channel.<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> Spock.<eos> I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance.<eos> I hereby confiscate this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel.
Because if they did, they'd know that all or almost all of the western strategic points had no secrets from the Russians and hadn't for a long time.<eos> They will lose trust in their institutions.<eos> Not one.<eos> Exchange Grigoriev and his family.<eos> That's all I came to ask you for.<eos> He won't say a word about all of this. I know him well.<eos> And we owe him a lot, don't we?<eos> An operation like that doesn't stand a chance to see the light of day, no chance at all.<eos> In fact you don't give a damn about people.<eos> You spent a lot of crap about Western democracies... but you're letting a man go to his death because it suits you.
I'm familiar with illuminati lore And the legend of the brandings.<eos> La purga is a dark stain on this church's history.<eos> I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us.<eos> Comandante, Have you begun the search for this explosive device?<eos> Of course, but it could be anywhere.<eos> My primary concern at the moment is the safety of the cardinals.<eos> The Sistine chapel is a fortress.<eos> As long as the cardinals are in conclave, Your security concerns are at a minimum.<eos> Devote as many of your resources--<eos> If you're about to suggest a naked-eye search Of the entire Vatican city, I will tell you we do not have the people.
But Silvano kept detailed journals.<eos> If he told anyone else About what we were doing, he would have made a note of it.<eos> Do you have these journals?<eos> I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.<eos> Please.<eos> You are correct that I may Grant you access to the archives.<eos> Thank you, padre.<eos> I said that you were correct that I may, not that I will.<eos> Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive.<eos> Given your recent entanglement with the church, There is a question I'd like to ask you first, Here, in the office of his holiness.
About 20 churches intersect those lines.<eos> None of them have names that invoke fire.<eos> So a Bernini sculpture must be inside one of them that does.<eos> We'll need to get into the archives to find it.<eos> Would you escort Mr. Langdon?<eos> Yes, father.<eos> Silvano's journals.<eos> The killer's name could be in here.<eos> Please. Fine, of course.<eos> Professor. Would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you?
Over the last six weeks, I've given out almost four parking tickets.<eos> One at the musee. overtime. And one, you'll recall, to you, in violation of the bent-license-plate law.<eos> -Yes, I recall.<eos> -It's all there in the report.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Well, I shall waste no time in reading it.<eos> And just in case, I've deftly cataloged, numbered and cross-referenced each offense here in my little black book.<eos> Now, Clouseau, you remember when I first put you on that parking ticket detail...<eos> Yes, you explained it was a top level assignment.<eos> And that if anyone ever asked you if I was the one who had assigned you to this incredibly important mission, you would deny it.
-But I was complimenting you.<eos> No, Inspector, you must not comment on a woman's body.<eos> -I get it. I get it. I keep it to myself...<eos> -Yes.<eos> -...when I am thinking...<eos> -Inspector.<eos> This will be an exercise and I want you to concentrate.<eos> And no matter what I say, I want your expression to remain neutral.<eos> That will be easy.<eos> You're here in the corridor at your employment, and you see a very pretty young woman walking toward you, and her blouse is tight and is rather bursting at the buttons, and she drops her pencil,
You shouldn't have remorse.<eos> A desire to live doesn't mean you lack humanity.<eos> Somebody's trying to drive me crazy.<eos> Can't believe what I see or hear anymore.<eos> They say I killed an unarmed woman.<eos> I think that would probably bother me too.<eos> I keep seeing that woman, the back of her head, her hair glued down to the carpet with her own blood.<eos> Think about what you just said.<eos> You're an intelligent man.<eos> What does your eye tell you?
- Yeah?<eos> I don't want to see you around here again, mmm?<eos> Capisce? Now get out.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm- place the scalpel at the base of the throat and carefully make a slit all the way down the front of the frog's belly.<eos> Now...<eos> Got in trouble for being late, by the way.<eos> Yeah, well, so did I.<eos> And tack it down...<eos> I can't believe I missed you getting your ass kicked.
I haven't clapped eyes on you since...<eos> Well...<eos> So, what have we now?<eos> What have we now?<eos> Tongue?<eos> Shirt up. Let me feel your liver.<eos> Right.<eos> Up.<eos> Pulse hectic, tongue furred, liver tender and enlarged.<eos> And obviously you've been exercising your brain every hour that God gave you.
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.<eos> You weren't there, so I made your customary bet.<eos> You're right. I'll keep it with your chequebook, locked safely away in my drawer.<eos> Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?<eos> I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.<eos> You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.<eos> I knew she'd been engaged. She had told me.<eos> So that's no to the opera, then?<eos> That was my waistcoat.<eos> I thought we agreed it's too small for you.
I remember, the bed was made.<eos> I remember thinking how neat everything looked.<eos> I got a call from Alice's mum, June.<eos> She'd said that Alice is missing and presumed, like, she drowned and I didn't not believe her, but, I don't know, it was kind of hard to take, so I actually called Alice's mobile.<eos> I just.. .<eos> Maybe wanted to see if.. . Hope it was a joke or something, I don't know.<eos> It was just a real shock.<eos> Just didn't really feel like it was real.<eos> Everything was the same as always, but people were saying Alice had drowned.<eos> Are there any memories from that night that stand out for you?
I'm not... Mr. Northcott, you asked me to come here.<eos> Mr. Northcott, please look at me.<eos> Mr. Northcott, please look at me.<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> I told you, I don't wanna talk to you right now.
-We need to get going, hon.<eos> Good evening.<eos> But it wasn't my fault.<eos> She asked for my help. I helped her.<eos> Then she comes back at me with that.<eos> What could I do?<eos> Everybody's playing with me, man.<eos> -Damn.<eos> -You need to listen to me.<eos> I told you yesterday not to mix it up with the locals.
Like you said,<eos> "Take a deep breath.<eos> "Make it count."<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Come on!<eos> Wait here.<eos> - You promised that you'd...<eos> - Let you go?<eos> I answered your questions.<eos> I told you what you wanted to know about Quantum.
We gave you all the food we have.<eos> It's up to you to ration it.<eos> Distribution is your problem.<eos> Asshole!<eos> Forget it! Fuck that!<eos> We're not doing that!<eos> I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going!<eos> I'm not gonna go!<eos> Bullshit!<eos> No one's asking you to go.
Who are you?<eos> Um... I'm a Good Samaritan.<eos> I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried.<eos> Worried?<eos> About the security of your shit.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> Who am I speaking to?<eos> Your files. Your... The documents.<eos> I know these documents are sensitive.<eos> But I am perfectly willing to give back to you your sensitive shit, you know, at a time of your choosing.
Yeah!<eos> I was gonna ride my bike.<eos> Osborne Cox.<eos> And you, I take it, are Mr. Black.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> You have the money?<eos> $50,000.<eos> That's what was agreed upon, Osborne Cox.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me explain something to you, Mr. Black.
Can you tell me what the problem is there?<eos> Suicide attempt.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Next stop, Meanwhile City Hospital.<eos> Not many people left this place in better shape than they arrived.<eos> I knew why I was there. And I was running out of time.<eos> Here.<eos> Get in!<eos> Oh, hello, dear.<eos> As Mr Tarrant probably explained, we want to fix you up with a homing device.
This is Frank Grant, David's Military Welfare Officer.<eos> I hope you don't mind if he joins us.<eos> Mr Esser.<eos> Peter, on the whole, we both felt it would have been wiser if you'd stayed at home.<eos> When you find David... what will happen?<eos> Well, obviously, he'll be returned to this institution immediately.<eos> He was getting so much better.<eos> The letter you sent...<eos> David's home visit is a little redundant now.<eos> As I told you, David took advantage of his assessment hearing to escape.
Open it!<eos> I got you. You son of a bitch!<eos> What is it?<eos> I heard gunshots.<eos> Get the murderer!<eos> I need to talk to Inspector Cifuentes.<eos> He's not here right now.<eos> Please, it's very urgent.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I just told you he's not in.
I was thinking of putting up a swing for Erika, since it's such a beautiful day, isn't it?<eos> So how are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Just out hunting.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> The German lady was different.<eos> We're not used to women like that around here.<eos> Stop it!<eos> What's gotten into you?
And when that happens, send them right down to me.<eos> I'm not so sure anyone will.<eos> This parish serves Irish and Italian families.<eos> Someone will hit Donald Miller.<eos> He has a protector.<eos> Who?<eos> Father Flynn.<eos> What?<eos> He's taken an interest.<eos> I told you to come to me, but I hoped you never would.
I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> I'm not praying, no.<eos> You seem subdued.<eos> Oh.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Bad dreams.<eos> Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you see that big hand pointing a finger at you?
Yes.<eos> - I haven't seen you here before.<eos> - I travel very much.<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> - I am a fashion illustrator.<eos> Photographer.<eos> I have just made a picture-series for Tidens Kvinder.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Thanks for wine.<eos> I questioned you about something.
29, rest.<eos> I gather you're Father Eugênio.<eos> That's me, Colonel, how are you?<eos> Sit down.<eos> No, Father, I haven't much time today.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Straight to the point, Colonel?<eos> Straight to the point.<eos> I want to help you capture and kill my father's murderer.<eos> Does this remind you of anything, Colonel?
- Yeah. This Robert Torrelson's house?<eos> Yeah, that's my father.<eos> You with the bank?<eos> No, I'm Paul Flanner.<eos> Is he in?<eos> What the hell do you want coming here?<eos> Your father wrote me a letter, said he wanted to talk.<eos> - Get back in your car and go.<eos> - I told you, he wrote me.<eos> And I told you to leave.
What's the matter, Wheeler?<eos> Am I getting warm?<eos> - All right, Son.<eos> I think we'd better be...<eos> - You know something?<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if he knocked her up on purpose just so he could spend the rest of his life hiding behind a maternity dress.<eos> That way he'd never have to find out what he's really made of.<eos> Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you.<eos> I mean, who the hell do you think you are?<eos> You come in here and say whatever crazy goddamn thing comes into your head, and I think it's about time somebody told you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.
I'm sorry if I, uh...<eos> No, no.<eos> I mean, I think you're nice.<eos> But...<eos> But... Well, to be totally honest with you, I'm already in a relationship.<eos> Well, I guess I'm a bit surprised.<eos> How so?<eos> At your office when I asked you...<eos> When you asked me...<eos> I asked you if you had a boyfriend.
I told you, I never forget a face.<eos> Victoria Station.<eos> Nor have I forgotten with whom you shared a taxi last night.<eos> Oh, you have.<eos> If you want to continue working for Delysia, you have.<eos> Now we all of us need things in our life.<eos> I need Joe for his...<eos> Well, he's a man of connections.<eos> And you need... You need to stay off of the streets, I imagine.<eos> I see Edythe has told you all.
How could we tell?<eos> Being possessed by the spirit of Aleister Crowley, he wouldn't appear any different than actually being Aleister Crowley.<eos> That's nonsense, Symonds.<eos> sorry, did we startle you?<eos> I'd like you to meet a friend.<eos> Alex, this is Dr. Mathers.<eos> Alex is in the same field as you... theoretical physics.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Mathers.<eos> And you, sir.<eos> Remember I told you, Alex was with me when Crowley died.
There's no need.<eos> I wrote the report.<eos> Silence, please. Silence, please.<eos> Order!<eos> You've been skipping seminars.<eos> I have a piece of information.<eos> Concerning one of the defendants.<eos> - Something they're not admitting.<eos> - What information?<eos> You don't need me to tell you. It's perfectly clear.
Nut deep in random pussy.<eos> And what little time you do spend sober and limp-dicked, you're working murders that don't even exist.<eos> Take the O.T. and work the hell out of your triple.<eos> Don't worry about your office reports.<eos> I cover you for the bosses.<eos> - What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Just work your triple.<eos> I'll cover every hour of it from my case file.<eos> Excuse me, sir. Sir.<eos> I'm with the "Baltimore Sun." Can I talk with you a minute?
I don't get it.<eos> Can you explain it?<eos> I didn't really know what to expect, uh, with Lee.<eos> She's... she's... she's a bitch.<eos> She's a super-bitch, actually.<eos> Um, we're all trying to kind of deal with her, because she's our boss.<eos> But, um, yeah, there's no other word for Lee.<eos> Lee doesn't really get along with anyone who isn't Lee.<eos> Mister?<eos> Hey, what's up, buddy? I heard what Vance said to you before.
It's a protoplanetary system.<eos> So?<eos> Nothing but rocks.<eos> No ringed gas giants like you claimed you saw.<eos> I did see it, Lieutenant.<eos> - If you say so, sir.<eos> - And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?<eos> I'm not saying anything, sir.<eos> I'm just following orders.<eos> - I'm ordering you to help me.
I'm--I'm Desmond hume, and, uh, I was told I could find you here.<eos> And I think I have... I've just been to the future.<eos> - The future?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Uh, I-I spoke to you there.<eos> You, uh, you told me to come here to--to Oxford to find you.<eos> You--you said you'd help me.<eos> Why didn't I just help you there in the future?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Why would I put you through the headache of time traveling?
I don't have any cash.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> You could use my help, right?<eos> You're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?<eos> I got a kid on the way!<eos> And I got a kid I may never see again.<eos> Yeah, get me Gretchen.<eos> Much to my surprise, There seems to be some degree of truth to your tale.<eos> Everything I told you is true.
- Problem, sir?<eos> We don't have a secure cabin.<eos> This vehicle will not move until all these ladies buckle up.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> One thing you'll learn about me is I do not kid, or jest, or joke, or jape... or quip.<eos> Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa.<eos> I saw that.<eos> I saw that, too.<eos> I see everything.<eos> Mr. Cortland, do you expect any further charges to be filed against you?
Take the wine.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'll just go open this.<eos> Where do you keep the corkscrew?<eos> Left of the sink, top drawer.<eos> Look.<eos> Base to Ranger One, we've got a makeup check in the dining room.<eos> - I repeat, makeup check in the dining room.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> It means she digs you, man.
You take his collar off, he beats us all to death,<eos> Now, who's the bright penny?<eos> So it's in my best interest to keep that collar on.<eos> Kill him! Danny!<eos> Kill him!<eos> When you're finished with the master, kill the dog.<eos> Good to see you Mr. Yussef.<eos> You fucker!<eos> Kill!<eos> Find anything to you like yet? Not yet.
It's time to show the goat.<eos> You could cut through shoes if you had to.<eos> - I mean-<eos> - What are you doing, man?<eos> frontline stuff.<eos> Watch this. Watch this.<eos> We have just been cutting things 90 to nothing.<eos> And the cooks, they just love it because every time-<eos> Hey, there, folks. My name is Amy, and I'II be taking care of you.<eos> - Sir, what can I get for you?
- Bring it...<eos> Bring it home?<eos> All right, let's bring it home.<eos> If you was hit by a truck, and you was lying out in that gutter dying and you had time to sing one song, huh?<eos> One song people would remember before you're dirt one song that would let God know what you felt about your time here on Earth, one song that would sum you up you telling me that's the song you'd sing?<eos> That same Jimmie Davis tune we hear on the radio all day?<eos> About your peace within and how it's real and how you're gonna shout it?<eos> Or would you sing something different?<eos> Something real? Something you felt?<eos> I'm telling you right now, that's the kind of song people want to hear.
It's PeeMoney123, mobile bug...<eos> Mobile...<eos> Enought!<eos> All right Pavel, we will use your MOBO...<eos> Thank you, doctor...<eos> - Get busy...<eos> - Yes doctor...<eos> Hello, wecome to ODIS, what can I start you with...?<eos> - We'd like a drink...<eos> - What can I get for you?
- That's right.<eos> Mr. Macha, I don't think we've met.<eos> I'm Miss Walker.<eos> I work for Mr. Gold. Do you mind if we walk?<eos> I understand you have been commissioned to do some work for us?<eos> I thought it might be a good idea if we had a little chat to make sure you understand the gravity of the endeavor you have undertaken.<eos> Yeah, I do, I understand.<eos> Everything's set.<eos> The date hasn't changed, you'll get the powder by Friday.<eos> Mr. Gold has put his faith in you, and he has people to please.
You've got to tell the boss.<eos> Why me?<eos> Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.<eos> This time you're going to tell me what's going on.<eos> Two sugars, am I right?<eos> Forget the tea, Avi.<eos> Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.<eos> You didn't tell us the truth about the three Eddies did you, Mr. Green?<eos> The Eddies upset Macha in some way so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed into some concrete on one of his buildings.<eos> Would you like us to remind you of what really happened?
Mr. Mystery.<eos> He's all up here, pretending to be you.<eos> No-one sees Gold, but Gold sees everything.<eos> You're in a game, Jake.<eos> You're in the game.<eos> Everyone's in his game, and nobody knows it.<eos> And all of this, this is his world. He owns it.<eos> He controls it.<eos> I've had enough of this shit. Tell him you've had enough.<eos> He tells you what to do...
We need a refill.<eos> Sorry, we're closed.<eos> Come back Tuesday.<eos> But I got a sick kid here.<eos> Look, I couldn't help you even if I wanted to.<eos> The pharmacist has left for the holiday.<eos> - Well, where is he?<eos> - He's off duty.<eos> And I doubt very much he's gonna want some guy interrupting his holi...<eos> Just a second, sir, and I'll draw you up a map.
If you're uncomfortable --<eos> Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.<eos> But don't think of me as an idiot.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> What's that?<eos> The Tumbler?<eos> Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.<eos> She was built as a bridging vehicle.<eos> During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.<eos> Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump -- Not now!
- Where you headed? - I'm late for Bhandari,<eos> - You know what he's like, Better get there,<eos> Catch you later,<eos> Ah, Catherine, - So nice of you to drop by,<eos> - Sorry I'm late,<eos> - This work of yours...<eos> - I know, I'm sorry,<eos> - I mean, it's interesting,<eos> - You think so?<eos> In that it has nothing to do with the problems I'd asked you to solve,
- You think so?<eos> In that it has nothing to do with the problems I'd asked you to solve,<eos> - It won't happen again,<eos> - What happened? You simply couldn't control yourself?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I thought I should get all those ideas down while they were in my head, and then it was morning, and I couldn't come in with nothing,<eos> But this is the third time that inspiration's overtaken you just at the moment when you had to submit to my idea of what it is you should be learning,<eos> - A third?<eos> Really,<eos> - Differential equations don't interest you,
Like that?<eos> Scorching!<eos> - Hey, Mr. Palmer. - How're you doing, Marla?<eos> - All right. You got a second?<eos> - Sure.<eos> So what are you doing here, Mr. Palmer?<eos> Well, you know, when I was a kid I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert.<eos> This pawn shop has got a '68 Stratocaster, the same guitar he used to play.<eos> The guy won't sell it to me.<eos> This guy look familiar to you? Maybe from back in your Brooklyn days?
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.<eos> - Come on, now.<eos> Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.<eos> Hey. Doc, I said, no.<eos> I said, no!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.<eos> Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear from you too, sir.<eos> Yes, sir. One moment, sir.<eos> Someone wants to talk to you.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.<eos> Lieutenant, where are you?<eos> Actually, I'm inside the UCA V EDI, sir.<eos> Look, lieutenant, I want you and that machine back on this ship ASAP.<eos> I need the status of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.<eos> - Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...<eos> - I know.<eos> Has her survival beacon been located?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Did Cummings tell you he would take charge of the search and rescue of Lieutenant Wade?
Yes.<eos> What's going on over there?<eos> Just moving some things around.<eos> Sky Studios.<eos> Tonight I'm actually going to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.<eos> -Designer friend.<eos> -l just thought it might be something... your designer friend would be interested in.<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Then I will put you back on with my--
- Mustafa.<eos> Tessa's family.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Police were here, bwana.<eos> When?<eos> This morning.<eos> They took away Mama Tessa's things.<eos> Better make a list of what's missing.<eos> Mustafa.<eos> See? I told you.
I'd also advise you to stop terrorizing us with stupid tapes.<eos> I had nothing to do with the tapes.<eos> Just before he died your father insisted it wasn't him.<eos> Believe what you want. I'm not lying.<eos> I'd like to talk to you, please.<eos> I don't want to argue with you in front of everyone.<eos> Say your piece and leave or I'll call the police. I'll have you ejected.<eos> You know you're not allowed here. I'm listening.<eos> Why so angry?<eos> What did I do to you?
Junk!<eos> If the two imbecis estão to the search of Work, I suggest that enter "ready" (now).<eos> There is work in the mountain Brokeback. The forest guards mounted Camps for that.<eos> But estão to 3 to 4 miles of the localities Where we are going to lead the flock.<eos> It is a barely illegal work and Nobody is going to protect you.
Mrs. Kasprzyk.<eos> - Tough teacher.<eos> - Tough, but fair.<eos> Okay, we know you're clean.<eos> And you've... Despite your motives, you've always been an asset to this office.<eos> And you're a good kid.<eos> I want to run some names past you.<eos> - Hold it, we're not done here.<eos> - I was done here three months ago.<eos> I told you then I'd give you Jerr, and that was that.
It's good no matter what.<eos> There's music! You get them playing "Shout" and you hate it.<eos> It's a good time, know what I mean?<eos> Rubbing up against each other, a couple of kids who like to fuck trying to make it honest. I get it.<eos> Guys, the real enemy here is the institution of marriage.<eos> It's not realistic, it's crazy.<eos> Don't do this for the other person. -Say yes to yourself and your future.<eos> -Say yes.<eos> Have some opportunities for yourself.<eos> I'm sure you'd love to be free maybe go out and meet some Latin guy that can dance grind up on you, make you feel dangerous but also safe.
Hatsumomo at my back.<eos> Mameha calling, offering me the chance to become one of those elegant women I'd seen on the bridge floating in a silk kimono, the Chairman at my side.<eos> Chiyo is my new protégée.<eos> As lovely as her big sister.<eos> And with eyes the colour of rain.<eos> The Baron is a very special man to me. My danna.<eos> Someday, if you are fortunate, you will have a patron too.<eos> Don't kneel. You are not a servant girl anymore.<eos> Step into the light.<eos> I see water in you. Does that displease you?
-lf you have heard any gossip...<eos> -Yes? ...then I hope you will follow your own advice.<eos> And what would that be, pray tell?<eos> Seek a second opinion.<eos> Chairman.<eos> Sayuri gave such a passionate performance, don't you think?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Mameha, did you invite the Chairman to my estate this weekend?<eos> It's my annual blossom-viewing party.<eos> Baron, I told you I can't go.
You wouldn't be playing, Paul.<eos> Just consulting.<eos> Anyone who was once the MVP of the National Football League must have a great deal of expertise to offer.<eos> Captain, what would you say to Mr. Crewe looking in, giving us the benefit of his experience?<eos> I think that's a real good idea, warden.<eos> We can use all the help we can get.<eos> Well, then, it's all settled.<eos> What you say, Paul?<eos> I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna have to pass.<eos> Now, I can assure you that your time here will be a whole lot easier if you just participate.
Ms. Huttinger.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> This is huge.<eos> It's the search engine to end all search engines.<eos> I've been dealing with Ken Patterson on this. I've been pounding him.<eos> - And he's agreed to give up 30 percent of the company for 100 million.<eos> Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley are drooling to take this public.<eos> Ms. Huttinger.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> When you have a moment, could I speak to you?
- Why do you think that?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Lincoln told me that he found a flying bug in Sector Six.<eos> Right.<eos> And I think that might be why he thought he could leave.<eos> Have you told anyone else about this?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm gonna do some digging.<eos> I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> And when I do, I'll share my information with you.
You are delusional.<eos> I like you, Jack.<eos> Well, maybe not, but I understand you.<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen.<eos> This way, you can prepare yourself.<eos> Okay.<eos> Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside.<eos> In the hall there will be a man who outranks you.<eos> First, he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done that you're making the world a safer place that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion.<eos> And then he'll tell you that I am to be released.
This? Blackmail.<eos> Pure and simple.<eos> My dad leveraged this guy to get his telegraph company... to get our little hardware store... the contract to supply his company with all the copper wire... they were gonna string across these great United States.<eos> This dirty little picture... brought us wealth, class... and respectability.<eos> Why are you showing me this?<eos> Ex malo bonum.<eos> Out of bad comes good.<eos> That's what people like you and me are put on this earth to prove.<eos> What really happened to you?<eos> What did my mom tell you?
How many got paid off for the frame, Louie? Huh?<eos> How many for the kill?<eos> It was Connelly.<eos> He set me up.<eos> He'll never talk.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm havin' a ball.<eos> Connelly talks.<eos> They all talk.<eos> And what have been your sins, my son?<eos> Well, Padre, I don't want to keep you up all night, so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.
You bet your life there's a misunderstanding.<eos> Grace Hawkins.<eos> You're Grace Hawkins.<eos> Mrs Hawkins, welcome to Little Wallop.<eos> Thank you, Vicar.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier, Mrs Hawkins. Oh, no. Not at all.<eos> Under the circumstances you did just the right thing.<eos> I could have been anybody, and please call me Grace.<eos> - Reverend!<eos> Ah, Mrs Parker, may I introduce you to our new housekeeper, Grace Hawkins.
Is the coach nice?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What'd you do today?<eos> I ran my balls off.<eos> What?<eos> 'Run your balls off, asshole.'<eos> 'Lsn't your mother a pain in the ass? '<eos> He said that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Didn't I tell you not to come out here?
Lucifer, source of light.<eos> He was called the most perfect of angels.<eos> It will make you, Lankester.<eos> But what will it make you?<eos> You're trying to see through me.<eos> Are you a head doctor as well?<eos> It doesn't take an expert to see you're suffering.<eos> You're in guilt.<eos> We're all in guilt.<eos> What I told you the other night I never told anyone else.
Come to dinner.<eos> Come on, Mirandolina, eat that.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> Go on, eat... That's all I have.<eos> So missy, I've got a headache.<eos> For about 4 days now I have a headache and I throw up but I don't think it's from the stomach.<eos> No...<eos> Aspirin, algocalmin, extraveral and distonocalm.<eos> No, I can't really, I've just told you I've got a headache.
We'll see what's wrong in an instant.<eos> You had a drink, didn't you?<eos> Well yes, I've drunk about a meter of spirits.<eos> - I see.<eos> And what is it that you drank? - Mastropol.<eos> - What did you say its name was?<eos> It's a drink made by us from double strength alcohol, burned sugar and a sachet of vanilla.<eos> But there are no chemicals in it.<eos> Mastropol<eos> Now I would ask you to stay still.
I'm sorry, but I only said that we need to hurry up.<eos> - We've been on the road since 10 pm.<eos> - You don't say!<eos> You should start by learning your place and letting us do our job.<eos> But you told me to get out, miss.<eos> We're all medical staff in here.<eos> No, we are medical staff of different qualification, nurse.<eos> You don't go teaching me, a doctor, the procedures.<eos> Doing that is called insolence.<eos> And from this very moment, if you want to stay I will ask you to keep your mouth shut.
We spoofed the line.<eos> They'll see whatever area code we want them to see.<eos> Now, do it and don't screw up.<eos> If you try to be a hero, that will only lead to a very painful death.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - This is dispatch.<eos> - Yeah, this is this is Jim Kroeper on the Newark run.<eos> Everything's rosy.<eos> "Rosy" is your panic word to indicate a problem.<eos> What did I tell you about trying to be a hero?
Damn them!<eos> They didn`t call the plumber!<eos> The sink is blocked.<eos> I had to wash my hands in the pit.<eos> This the Mrs Estrelita de Navasquee', she`s the actress of my movie.<eos> "Encantado", Nino Ricci.<eos> Nice to meet you, Morena.<eos> He calls me Estrelita.<eos> He changes the name to everybody.<eos> That`s a nice name for you, it`s magic.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.<eos> My son wishes that I would just stay sick.<eos> I don't scold him, I don't go drinking...<eos> How long has it been hurting?<eos> Yes?<eos> - Just... since the accident.<eos> - No, I don't mean that.<eos> Haven't you had abdominal pain?<eos> It must've been quite severe.<eos> Listen carefully to what I tell you.
How's everything on the west side?<eos> Oh, it's good.<eos> I'm sorry to just drop in on you like this.<eos> It's all right. What do you need?<eos> Look, I...<eos> I just want to say, I really appreciate you just taking the high road like this. I really do.<eos> I mean, I'm a science teacher, you know. I know how these things work, with adrenaline and hormones, and by all accounts, you got every right to just deck me and just tell me to go to hell.<eos> Hey, Glenn, what are you talking about?<eos> Did she not...<eos> Did Tami not tell you what happened the other night?
Here<eos> Excuse me, if that form gets accepted then it's Kim Hee Jin now?<eos> Yes<eos> Is today the last day?<eos> Yes today is the last day<eos> If it was Kim Hee Jin, then I wouldn't have come up<eos> The only Kim Sam Soon in the world went up the mountain because she believed what I said<eos> The least I could do was to show my sincerity<eos> Excuse me..<eos> I'm sorry but can you just give me back the form I just gave you?
Not a good area.<eos> But it was not for people.<eos> Just ruined.<eos> And I hated living there.<eos> I hated it.<eos> At first ... because my parents moved there and I was with them and I think that influenced our music, the area where we came from may have given more meaning.<eos> The place where we come from ... There are many great metal factories there.<eos> You know, the factories of "heavy metal" are all there.<eos> There are aluminum and steel.<eos> And you can see the impact on the environment around you and also in people.
One of those kids was the dead one.<eos> She stopped in front of a car who picked them all up, her and the kids.<eos> Was the car coming from casualty or from the other direction?<eos> I didn't see.<eos> How many people were in the car?<eos> Before the four of them got in, there was just the driver.<eos> Do you remember what he looked like?<eos> No, Inspector.<eos> He wasn't black.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.
Did she dress up and put perfume on to watch TV?<eos> Actually, she had started going out more recently.<eos> She'd bought herself a scooter and sometimes came home late.<eos> There she is, that's Eva.<eos> - Did she have any friends?<eos> - Yes, she did. She told me about them sometimes.<eos> They were all Eastern European girls.<eos> - But I didn't know them.<eos> - I see.<eos> Alright, we'll inform you if we have any news.
I said, please shoot!<eos> You've done too many stimulants!<eos> It's coming... It's coming!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You're mistaken!<eos> Hurry up and come.<eos> Damn!<eos> You're mistaken!<eos> And then?<eos> It's like I told you.
He was a customer of your husband's.<eos> Husband ?<eos> He got me my green card and more trouble than i need.<eos> Why don't you ask victor ?<eos> If you can find him.<eos> Yeah, well, that's the problem, Mrs. Rios.<eos> Your husband has left the country.<eos> Now, we know he's in puerto rico.<eos> You see ? You know more than me.<eos> He didn't tell you he was leaving ?
We can do that, richard.<eos> We certainly have 4400s that can do some damage, but once we take that step, there's no turning back.<eos> Excuse me, but shouldn't there be bars on these windows?<eos> The point is to be unobtrusive, dr. Burkhoff.<eos> Well, this seems a little lax to me.<eos> Most of you are 4400s. I'm a collaborator.<eos> You know what they do to collaborators? [Quietly]:<eos> We need to get him working.<eos> It calms him down considerably.<eos> We cleared out a room for you.
Better that you don't<eos> Your daddy told me all about you i bet he did look, come on in.<eos> I'll show you guys the guest room or maybe somebody sleep on the couch<eos> not too shabby from my first college it was a good paper, well fall out so what's the minus for?<eos> Well, i always like to leave a bit room for improvement last days of pompeii yeah, they throw that party every year you should go, go out some steam you've earned it<eos> i hate to go alone, you're up for it?<eos> I probably love to have remembered that threat not my scene, but don't let me stop you i don't know how it works, they put something inside me one of those enzyme or whatever so someone drinks from the same bottle as you do and they lose weight<eos> maybe we should give him a demonstration cut it out, Louis she thinks she needs to lose eight pounds try ten sweetie, you're beautiful, you don't need to lose anything he's right about that, you don't<eos> a lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen and Lis had to take a job at a diner we were apart for sixteen years but while i was gone, they gave me a way to make it up to her<eos> Mr. Applebaum, no one's telling you not to provide for your daughter but a 4400 putting his gift on the open market is the first we wanna make sure nobody gets to take advantage of that not you, not the buyer, other 4400... you don't have to teach me about selling
- 30 years ago, I --<eos> - No! Don't.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> It's just -- it's better if you experience it in the moment.<eos> Don't verbalize.<eos> Okay, now, this should help you feel nice and relaxed.<eos> Once you're semi-conscious, the electrodes will administer small pulses to put you into a hypnotic state.<eos> I'm going to need some help accessing Jacquelyn.<eos> Right.<eos> Mr. Bristow will speak to you through your ear bugs.
I ran some tests.<eos> What kind of tests?<eos> You may be very sick, Mr. Bristow.<eos> Now, you'll need additional bloodwork to be sure --<eos> I thought I made myself clear, Marshall.<eos> This is not something I care to discuss.<eos> I understand.<eos> Just hear me out. You have a mutation.<eos> Marshall, I've heard enough.<eos> Damn it, you may not care what happens to you, but what happens to you affects other people.
Of course.<eos> Miss Bristow?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Oh, Gordon Dean, Office of Special Investigations.<eos> Any word on Vaughn?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I hate to do this now, agent Bristow, given what you've been through.<eos> I already called in a report.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I just need for you to clarify a few things, if that's all right with you.
What about before the accident?<eos> Did agent Vaughn seem anxious, perhaps preoccupied?<eos> He seemed relaxed.<eos> We were taking a few days off.<eos> You're not writing any of this down. You are not telling me anything worth writing. I'm telling you exactly what I remember.<eos> - Isn't that correct?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And you understand that marital privilege does not trump matters of national security.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Then I am asking you to remember where your loyalty lies.
Sir, there are no 3:00 and 10:00 rounds.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I trust that you'll remove the tap on Sloane's phone.<eos> Already done.<eos> And the decoder disk. The real one.<eos> It's been turned over. Good.<eos> There's a lot of outside pressure on this task force.<eos> I don't want it compromised from within.<eos> I understand.<eos> You know, Marcus, when I asked you to keep an eye on Sloane, I meant it.
You know, after the Gideon, this could turn the entire fleet against you.<eos> Then the real question is, whether or not it matters to you.<eos> You know, I am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism.<eos> We all want this fleet to survive.<eos> I think you're doing very well.<eos> Very well, under the circumstances.<eos> I understand this has been a difficult job for you.<eos> I mean, I hear that your reports haven't exactly... ingratiated you with the Commander, have they?<eos> Or the rest of the crew, for that matter.<eos> Still, luckily, as a member of the civilian government... I'm here to assure you that I have no such reservations.
I grew up in Cleaves Mills.<eos> I'm actually late for a meeting.<eos> Please, Ally... that's really important that you and i speak.<eos> Why ?<eos> Who are you ?<eos> My name is Johnny Smith...<eos> Herbert Smith was my father.<eos> What do you want ?<eos> This is awkward.<eos> What my father did to you was wrong... but I think he had a good reason.
To the Jefe de Policía.<eos> "I am aware of Mr Wolcott's difficulty.<eos> You will find me personally grateful...<eos> "for any adjustments you may make in his case."<eos> What did you think that was about?<eos> I didn't think about it.<eos> You were my agent in Mexico.<eos> You had many responsibilities.<eos> You asked me for the letter, and I wrote it.<eos> As when the earth talks to you, particularly, you never ask its reasons?
- So, an accident.<eos> Handling his weapon.<eos> A self-inflicted wound.<eos> Fucking stupid, showing off when he's been fucking drinking.<eos> Or a stupid fucking trick, more than one fucking time he'd do that.<eos> - For Christ's sake.<eos> - Are there other kin, Mr Manuel?<eos> - There's just us.<eos> - Mother and father dead, no siblings-<eos> - What did I just fucking say to you?
"according to mitigating facts. "<eos> If I discern this correctly, sir... this statement could be taken to mean... nothing.<eos> The statement continues.<eos> "New title will be awarded on claims to which title is denied at set prices...<eos> "via lottery as conducted by the County Commissioner. "<eos> I would be grateful if that gets in your next edition.<eos> I must tell you, Commissioner, that even with that last bit added... what exactly will or won't qualify... or mitigate the presumption of ownership, eludes me.<eos> I didn't realise that was a bar the statement had to hurdle.<eos> Without an accompanying explanation, sir... this statement may work an unsettling effect.<eos> In any case, sir, being the commissioner of this county... and bidding you good day... I have presented you with that to publish in your paper... as organ of record in this camp.
No.<eos> What the fuck did you come here for, if not to be protected?<eos> Don't be like your dead fucking friend, afraid to face the truth.<eos> I was just looking to turn a trick.<eos> Mr Utter... you'll agree our shaking hands would be incongruous?<eos> I come for my partner's letter... which you told Doc Cochran you would give me.<eos> I can't guarantee it's genuine, but it has the feel of authenticity... and it's clear he would want her to have it.<eos> - To his wife, then.<eos> - Agnes Lake.<eos> Prudence dictates my requiring in return... your account of what Miss Stubbs told you.
We're not doing that.<eos> Suppose I'll have to dip into my own kit, then.<eos> Even so, it's back to cutting my own hair.<eos> I'll take the idea around.<eos> Swearengen would put it up.<eos> Fucking reputable people.<eos> If money had to be clean before it was recirculated... we'd still be living in fucking caves.<eos> - Your old man?<eos> - Me.<eos> Mr Lee will provide opium to you exclusively... for sale to whites in the camp.
I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?<eos> Hi.<eos> Piano player,right?<eos> This is so generous of you.<eos> There it is.<eos> It's not exactly a concert grand.<eos> I should warn you, on the whole,our patients are generally unresponsive, so I hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.<eos> Miss Delaney, I find when the spiritual rewards are this great, who needs applause?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Did Addison talk to you about me?
- I'm sorry?<eos> - Feed the dog.<eos> and I turned around, and there was Zach young-- and that's Zach with an "h"- pointing a gun at me.<eos> You gotta understand, Zach's had a tough time.<eos> - He's got emotional issues-- - 'cause he's crazy.<eos> Still, I don't think he meant to hurt anybody.<eos> Uh,hello!<eos> Uh,he was waiting there for you to come home so he could kill you.<eos> Is that what happened when you got home?<eos> The kid took a shot at you?
- Mom, stop, stop.<eos> Listen.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Yesterday I overheard mike telling that cop that he didn't wanna press charges against Zach.<eos> He made the whole thing sound like it was your fault.<eos> My fault?<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, I need a paternity test.<eos> Well, we'll just schedule you for an exam.
There's plenty of room.<eos> No chance.<eos> He's a liability, I'm not having him on board.<eos> We'd be dead without him.<eos> My decision is final.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Good luck, yeah?<eos> You still can't promise me.<eos> What if she gets lost?<eos> What if something happens to you, Doctor, and she's left all alone, standing on some moon a million light years away?
That is so not right.<eos> I'm gonna order an M.R.I. so I can take a closer look at your brain.<eos> Yeah, there's no way --<eos> Mr. Duff?<eos> Mr. Duff, can you see me?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Stay with me.<eos> I wouldn't have picked you for the mommy track, nurse Betty.<eos> See?<eos> I told you I know things.
All right, uh, i-if you can-- No.<eos> If he can work it so we keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?<eos> It's not about the money.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> I need to know that whatever I ask you to do, however distasteful you find it, you'll do it. And just as importantly, you need to know that.<eos> What's going on with my wife?<eos> Even if I was Dr. House, physician-patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations.<eos> She told me about the tumor.<eos> Yeah?<eos> She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?
- Cowards!<eos> - "...in unmarked, nonconsecutive 20s."<eos> - Weaklings!<eos> - "Await instructions."<eos> - Bums!<eos> - Bummer.<eos> This is a bummer, man.<eos> That's... That's a bummer.<eos> Brandt will fill you in on the details.<eos> Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
People knew about the Manhattan Project, you know, and they kept it a secret.<eos> That was just the creation of the atom bomb.<eos> Ms Lerner, Tom Beck.<eos> I understand you've come into some information.<eos> Ms Lerner was just expressing her lack of enthusiasm for matters of national security where journalistic competitiveness is at stake.<eos> Mr President, I'm not interested in using Ellie to further my career.<eos> What do you know about E.L.E.?<eos> I know you should have picked a better cover story than a sick wife.<eos> See?<eos> What did I tell you?
Come and talk to me for a second here, come on.<eos> Your attitude constitutes a breach of faith.<eos> In Nevada that's illegal.<eos> Your name? - My name?<eos> Tony Pitzicatta.<eos> Tony Pitzicatta, ok.<eos> - What may I ask is your name, sir?<eos> It's on my driver's licence.<eos> - I think we've met before.<eos> Might be able to squeeze you in, sir.
The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.<eos> The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters ... that I would never understand.<eos> If the pigs were gathering in Vegas ... I felt the drug culture should be represented as well.<eos> And there was ... a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Vegas ... hotel and then just wheeling across town and checking into another.<eos> Me and a 1,000 ranking cops from all over America.<eos> Why not? Move confidently into their midst.<eos> - Welcome to The Flamingo Hotel, sir.<eos> My arrival was badly timed.<eos> I'm a police chief from Michigan.<eos> Look, fella, I have explained to you.
You won't come upstairs?<eos> "Star lost in the light of dawn,<eos> "creaking wind, warmth and breath,<eos> "The night is over.<eos> You are light and morning. "<eos> The doctor came by this morning.<eos> I know.<eos> I pretended to be asleep.<eos> I heard you talking about me.<eos> He told you that the final countdown had begun.
The computer simulator reports a direct hit, sir.<eos> Congratulations, gentlemen.<eos> We have just sunk the Vasiliev.<eos> Now can we attempt to contact the Vasiliev, sir, and find out what's going on?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Set a course for the ship.<eos> Get Grinkov on the phone.<eos> I wanna tell him personally that he's dead.<eos> She's moving, sir.<eos> What did I tell you, major?
Present arms.<eos> Keep up the good work, ladies.<eos> - Order, hut.<eos> - Order.<eos> Welcome to the Seahawk, ma'am.<eos> I can't tell you how good it feels to get out of Washington's smoke-filled rooms.<eos> Captain Boone.<eos> Glad to have you with us, ma'am.<eos> Nice of you to say so, all things considered.<eos> Our Ensign Sims will show you to your quarters, ma'am.
Anyway, when they busted this guy, they found Holford's dog tags and a couple of teeth he was getting ready to show Holford's mother.<eos> Were they authentic?<eos> The tags were, the teeth weren't.<eos> What about Osbourne?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Another Polish dog?<eos> - What?<eos> - No.<eos> If Holford is still alive, he is potentially a big embarrassment to the agency.<eos> I told you before, Osbourne's a sweeper, remember?
Well, I guess one sailor's not enough for her, huh?<eos> Commander Rabb?<eos> Sorry to bother you, Judge.<eos> In here, it's Laura.<eos> And you are?<eos> Sarah MacKenzie.<eos> Pleased to meet you, Sarah.<eos> Anything?<eos> Just a lot of questions.<eos> Did the admiral ever talk to you about a man named Jack Holford?
- The band?<eos> - No, not the band.<eos> In World War II, Allied pilots regularly engaged in air-to-air intercepts with unidentified flying objects.<eos> They called them foo-fighters.<eos> Until a flying saucer with little green men come down and threaten to interrupt the Super Bowl, I don't wanna hear about it, okay, Bud?<eos> - Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> - What?<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> That's what I was telling you about, sir.
I'd rather stand, ma'am.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now, I have a short time to prepare, so forgive me if you've been over this before.<eos> As long as we get one thing straight from the beginning, major.<eos> You see, it's my ass on the line, so when it comes to my defence, I have the final say, capiche?<eos> You know, I really prefer that you sit.<eos> Is that an order, ma'am?<eos> Do I have to make it one?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna ask you if you killed Ensign Felker.
Why did you cultivate Corporal Magida?<eos> The Mossad ordered me to.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> What did the Mossad want from him?<eos> They wanted to find out if the Americans knew that Israel was selling missile software to China.<eos> So, what did Corporal Magida do?<eos> He stole two reports from the American embassy and passed them to me in Jericho Park.<eos> Can't you see that she's talking from a script, sir?<eos> No, I don't see that.<eos> Are these the documents that Corporal Magida gave you?
My mind's open.<eos> But if the politicians want a scapegoat, I'll be damned if I'll give them Colonel Farrow.<eos> Well, so long as you have an open mind.<eos> Captain Banes, you led the operation code-named Manta Ray, correct?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - And the objective was to?<eos> To extract Marines being held by rebel forces in Haiti, ma'am.<eos> Who ordered execution of that operation?<eos> Operation Manta Ray, Order Number Alpha-57329 to be executed at 0430 Zulu, 17 September, 1900... We read the op. Order, captain.<eos> What we're asking is, who told you to go in?
Colonel, we're here to investigate into circumstances surrounding Operation Manta Ray.<eos> Commander, let me make it easy.<eos> I gave the order, I'll take the heat.<eos> Nobody's faulting anyone, sir.<eos> Well, I doubt they sent two JAG officers 1200 miles to mete out credit.<eos> By "take the heat," are you saying you disobeyed a direct order, sir?<eos> - Commander...<eos> - Sir, I'd like to advise you, you don't have to make any statement regarding the suspected offence.<eos> Any statement you do make may be used against you in a court-martial.<eos> - You have the right to counsel, which I strongly advise you to exercise, sir.
I don't like surprises, admiral.<eos> Did you advise your client to change his plea?<eos> Of course not, Your Honour.<eos> I'm as surprised as you are.<eos> With the court's indulgence, I'd like a continuance.<eos> Your Honour, excuse me.<eos> Why draw this out?<eos> The defendant admits his guilt.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> I'd like to speak to my client, if that's all right with you, commander.
We think someone might have seen what happened in the store.<eos> Somebody inside.<eos> Did you see anyone by the magazine rack?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's go over what you did see.<eos> No, thank you, commander.<eos> I didn't ask you to save me the other day.
He talks to the enlisted men.<eos> Although I think that's on account of us having a better poker game.<eos> We play strictly for fun, of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> - So Yankee's a bit of a gambler?<eos> - Major, I... I don't care about your poker games, Petty Officer Riggs.<eos> I just wanna know more about Commander Douglas.<eos> Listen, let's just say he wasn't afraid to lay down a little wager, or a big one for that matter.<eos> You know these fighter jocks, ma'am, they're not afraid to take a risk.<eos> He ever talk to you about his personal life?
- Are you out of your mind?<eos> Groves is a demented sociopath without a scoosh of remorse.<eos> - Well, maybe.<eos> - He ate his parents.<eos> He killed them, carved them up, and he ate them.<eos> - What can you do with him?<eos> - Teach him table manners.<eos> The only thing a guy like that understands is punishment, hard and swift.<eos> Leo, you said it yourself, our first conversation, all we do is recycle.<eos> - Warden, need to talk to you.
Which means nothing.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that Jefferson Keane's girlfriend was pregnant?<eos> Because I didn't know.<eos> He didn't tell me that.<eos> So much for your credibility.<eos> Man, this is some bullshit.<eos> Jefferson, the warden was very specific about how this is going to work.<eos> So what's this proxy shit?<eos> While you'll be here, and your fiancée will be at your local Baptist church, you'll both be exchanging vows at the same time and each of you will have someone standing in for the other person.<eos> Come on, Father, don't this seem fucked up to you?
Savor the moment.<eos> I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time.<eos> I'm not here to gloat.<eos> You deserve to. You won.<eos> I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis.<eos> You swore you'd track me down and you did.<eos> You got your revenge.<eos> Actually, that's what I'm here to talk about... revenge.<eos> One of my favorite topics.<eos> I believe that was intended for you.
It's not about me.<eos> Do you want your freedom or not? Freedom, huh?<eos> Tell me, if they did release me, where would I go?<eos> What would I do? Anything you want.<eos> What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead?<eos> Can I do that?<eos> Can you?<eos> Can anyone?<eos> No. I didn't think so.<eos> In that case, I'll tell you what I want.
Odo? I came up from the surface as soon as I heard you were here.<eos> How... how are you holding your shape?<eos> I... I thought...<eos> I learned to counter the barrier's effects a long time ago.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> You look different.<eos> I've gotten better at shape-shifting over the years.<eos> You're as beautiful as I remember.<eos> You can't know how I've longed to hear your voice see your smile. Odo...<eos> what's gotten into you?
Perhaps he decided he couldn't let us go through with it.<eos> Everyone we met... they never existed.<eos> They existed.<eos> As long as we remember them... they always will.<eos> Come in.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The other Odo, the one from the planet... came to Sick Bay before he left the ship.<eos> Oh? He linked with me.<eos> Now... I know everything that happened.<eos> The, uh... other day, when I told you about Shakaar and... me not seeing each other anymore... you seemed so uncomfortable.
What were your initial impressions of Dr. Bashir?<eos> Good and bad.<eos> Young, eager, ambitious.<eos> He was fresh out of medical school. Looking forward to his first taste of "frontier medicine."<eos> Sometimes, he let that natural impulse override his sense of decorum.<eos> You mean he was...<eos> difficult. No, but sometimes he could... well, give you way too much information.<eos> Could you elaborate on that?<eos> Sometimes, he just... didn't know when to shut up.<eos> Are you implying he harassed you with unwanted advances?
- Thank you.<eos> My father says, "You can never have too much good luck".<eos> - He sounds like a wise man.<eos> - And he makes a fierce jambalaya.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Ancient Bajoran texts.<eos> The Emissary looks for guidance on the eve of battle.<eos> Guidance, insights, loopholes...<eos> I'll take anything I can get.<eos> And what do the Prophets tell you?
And then one day, the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians... just like that.<eos> They made these people refugees overnight.<eos> It's not that simple and you know it.<eos> These people don't have to live here like this.<eos> We've offered them resettlement.<eos> They don't want to be resettled.<eos> They want to go home to the lives they built.<eos> How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians?<eos> I'm not here to debate Federation policy with...<eos> I didn't tell you to turn around.
I should have let that monster die forgotten and alone.<eos> Frankly, I'm glad you came.<eos> Misery loves company.<eos> All my life I've done nothing but try to please that man.<eos> I let him mold me... let him turn me into a mirror image of himself.<eos> And how did he repay me?<eos> With exile. But I forgave him.<eos> And here, in the end, I thought maybe just maybe, he could forgive me.<eos> From what I've seen of him over the past month he doesn't come across as the forgiving type.<eos> I've been a fool. Let this be a lesson to you, Doctor. Perhaps the most valuable one I can ever teach you.
Then as a Bajoran Liaison Officer, what will you do to fight the Dominion?<eos> Fighting isn't an option.<eos> This is different than the Cardassian occupation.<eos> is it?<eos> The Cardassians are in control of this station.<eos> Bajoran freedoms are being curtailed one by one.<eos> And soon the first wave of alien troops will be landing on our world.<eos> We're talking about unarmed Vorta facilitators.<eos> They come in, do their job and leave.<eos> Can't you see what is happening to you?
That is our assumption as well, but we must be sure.<eos> So I have been given command of a bird-of-prey... the Rotarran... to conduct a search for the B'Moth.<eos> This is the first time I will have led troops in the field since... my confinement by the Dominion.<eos> It must be an exciting prospect.<eos> I tell you, Worf... without shame... there were days in that prison camp when the thought that I would never again set foot in a Klingon vessel made me weep like an old woman.<eos> I envy you the days ahead.<eos> It will be a glorious adventure.<eos> An adventure that we could share, my friend.<eos> I need someone I can trust at my side someone whose loyalty I can count on.<eos> Worf, son of Mogh I ask you to join me on this mission as my friend... and as my First Officer.
There's a Cardassian tradition... shri-tal.<eos> The dying give their secrets to their family to use against their enemies but I have no one left to carry my secrets.<eos> No one but you.<eos> Me?<eos> Be my daughter one last time, Nerys.<eos> Hear what I know, and use it as you see fit.<eos> I hate to sound callous but we have a tremendous opportunity here.<eos> Ghemor is basically volunteering to give us more intelligence on Cardassia than we've been able to gather in five years.<eos> That's exactly what he's doing.<eos> It's quite a responsibility he's handing you.
I don't think he would agree with you.<eos> Perhaps, we should find out. Dukat, I have a week to live... maybe less.<eos> Do you really expect me to trade my silence for a few short days under the Cardassian sun?<eos> It is where you belong, Ghemor.<eos> And it's where I'd be at this very moment if you hadn't betrayed our people to the Dominion.<eos> Good day, Dukat.<eos> He doesn't seem to like you very much.<eos> We're going to have to do something about your public image.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> You haven't heard my entire offer. We do have something else I think might interest you.
He reminded me so much of my father.<eos> Going through it again, l-I... I just couldn't face it.<eos> But in the end, you did.<eos> You were there for Ghemor.<eos> I owed it to him. I owed it to my father... to get it right this time.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I understand Legate Ghemor has passed away.<eos> You must be very relieved.<eos> Oh, Captain, such cynicism does not suit you.
Once or twice.<eos> - You knew about this, didn't you?<eos> - l had a pretty good idea.<eos> - And you did nothing to stop it.<eos> - No.<eos> In fact, I recommended you for the position.<eos> Allow me to congratulate the new Supreme Commander of the Ninth Fleet.<eos> Do you have any idea of the paperwork a Supreme Commander has to do?<eos> You're welcome.<eos> May I arrange quarters for you on the station?
Impulse, too. I think the problem must be somewhere else.<eos> I think maybe... the helm's being blocked.<eos> Like... some kind of failure in the computer pathways?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I just said all that.<eos> You're not listening, Harry.<eos> I'll return to my station, Lieutenant. I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I've got a lot on my mind.<eos> Forget about her.<eos> What did Tom say to you?
I want to know everything about you.<eos> I didn't realize how lonely my existence was and I can't go back to the way things were, not without you.<eos> Tuvok to Bridge.<eos> Intruder alert.<eos> Security team to my quarters. No!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> ! Don't you want us to be together?<eos> Given your actions, I have no choice but to consider you a potential threat to myself and to Voyager.<eos> But you're wrong.<eos> I would never do anything to harm you.
I'm not sure I've ever said that exactly, but... that doesn't mean it's not true.<eos> How could I be your friend? I don't know you.<eos> tell me what you do remember.<eos> Uh, people around me, crowded around me.<eos> You... a boy... a young girl.<eos> I was in a chamber... a bio-temporaI chamber.<eos> Good.<eos> I was inside it and you told someone to activate it.<eos> I'm afraid you're confused.<eos> I discussed the bio-temporaI chamber with you, but we're not ready to put you inside it just yet.
Who told you that?<eos> Let's just say there are rumors. Yeah, well, don't believe everything you hear.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I just wanted you to know that whatever happens, I'm with you.<eos> Computer, resume turboIift.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Just tell me what you want me to do.<eos> AII right, Ensign, here it is.<eos> I want you to put all crew quarters on lockdown.<eos> I'II ask you if you've finished upgrading the internal sensors.
Shoot.<eos> What are you waiting for? Fire.<eos> Re-engage the safety nodes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Put down your weapons.<eos> You're under arrest for violating Station Code 4279, Subsection Beta-325.<eos> No, don't!<eos> I'm in Sick Bay?<eos> Yes, Mr. Neelix.<eos> You sustained third-degree plasma burns and a moderate concussion, but my skills have prevented you from suffering permanent damage.
Fine-- then leave.<eos> That is enough.<eos> He may be crucial to the survival of your colonies.<eos> He would've let us die down there.<eos> That is no justification for murder.<eos> Dr. Vatm, why did you try to launch without us?<eos> Does it have to do with the discovery you made about the asteroids?<eos> Answer him, or I'II throw you out myself.<eos> Compose yourself, Mr. Hanjuan.<eos> Once we return to Voyager, we will find out... Who put you in command?
Fortunately, my alter ego didn't do any... permanent harm.<eos> He certainly knew his way around a hypospray. I'll give him that. Good riddance.<eos> Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Kes. I'm ready to get to work on those analyses. I'm glad to hear it.<eos> I'm also pleased you've decided to remain on board.<eos> I would have had my hands full in Sick Bay without you.<eos> The Captain suggested that I consider all the consequences.<eos> If I am going through changes in my life, things that are unpredictable, this is the best place for me.<eos> Surrounded by those who know you... and... care for you.
Can you explain how the blood of two people you claim not to know got onto your shirt?<eos> No.<eos> What about the prints in the house?<eos> Were they my prints?<eos> You won't get a confession because I can't answer your questions because I don't remember.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney and have an attorney present during questioning.<eos> If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning.<eos> Do you understand each of the rights I have explained to you?
- A statement made by the proprietor...<eos> - The guy who claims he saw the victim.<eos> No, no, not the victim.<eos> Her apparition.<eos> What the Irish call a fetch.<eos> What is more commonly known as a wraith.<eos> OK.<eos> Were there any written messages in the other cases?<eos> Written messages?<eos> Do the words "she is me" have any meaning to you?
As I had breached this facility, I needed to find my way out to safety, depending on Scully to weave her story, to tell her tale, to make them believe the lie.<eos> - Agent Scully, please have a seat.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Agent Scully, we've had a brief discussion, but will you restate the matter we're here to put to rest?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X-Files.<eos> As I am a medical doctor, with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, whose investigations into the paranormal were fueled by a personal belief that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12.<eos> I come here today, four years later... to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work.<eos> That it is my scientific opinion that he became, through the course of these years, a victim... a victim of his own false hopes and of his belief in the biggest of lies.<eos> You were contacted by a man who claimed he worked for the Department of Defense, a Michael Kritschgau, who told you that Mulder had been taken in by a hoax.
He has deceived you with beautiful lies.<eos> He's told you everything you believe about the existence of extraterrestrial life is untrue.<eos> And what are you saying?<eos> As I said, I'm offering you a chance to know the truth.<eos> - In exchange for what?<eos> - Quit the fbi.<eos> Come work for me.<eos> I can make your problems go away.<eos> No deal.<eos> After all I've given you.
Do you know for whom?<eos> Agent Scully was prepared to name the man at the fbi who was involved in this plot against you and her.<eos> We believe she was going to name Assistant Director Skinner, whom we have learned has been working inside the fbi with a secret agenda.<eos> I refuse to believe that.<eos> We've accumulated substantial evidence against him.<eos> - Can you show it to me?<eos> - Agent Mulder, if you name this man today in your testimony, we can file charges against him.<eos> Charges which may very well exonerate you.<eos> Name Skinner and save myself.<eos> That's what I called you here to recommend, as a friend.
This man in the baseball hat was identified by the officer on duty at the forensics lab as "Agent Mulder".<eos> - Can you get a usable image off this?<eos> - I'm gonna deliver it to Special Photo now.<eos> What did you want to talk to me about?<eos> You were writing me a note.<eos> I was just checking on your progress.<eos> Ms Covarrubias?<eos> I'm Walter Skinner, an assistant director at the FBI.<eos> - Yes? - I was hoping you could help me.<eos> I understand Agent Fox Mulder has been in contact with you about a project.
Don"t put your fur up, Frank. I"ll be there.<eos> I have a feeling we could wrap this up right now.<eos> It"s not gonna be like last time.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Let"s just go. Okay?<eos> Now you listen to me, Mister Grand High Poobah of Upper Butt Crack.<eos> I"m just about half past give a shit with your fun and games.<eos> My husband"s death was ruled an accident and you know it better than anyone.<eos> "Death by misadventure," to be exact.<eos> I"m sure there"s people who"d tell you I had plenty of reasons to kill Joe.
- Thirty seconds.<eos> - Can we get a copy of that face?<eos> - No, it's too big a file.<eos> Back up to tape.<eos> She's got a tape backup.<eos> We can make a copy and take it with us.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> Misspent youth in video arcades, I guess.<eos> A lot of quarters.<eos> Why would he send this to you?
I dreamt about your death, Father.<eos> You died a second time, to save me.<eos> This morning, I feel strangely calm as if I'm living in your body<eos> in your silhouette your walk, your gestures. These bony fingers this rough hand.<eos> Is it yours or mine? I feel your muscles flex in my arms.<eos> This skin, it's yours burnt, toughened defying the heat, the cold, the years.<eos> These veins, you called them the paths of life.<eos> Now, I understand.<eos> I need to ask a favor.<eos> I've always obeyed you.
And I'll always be here to open this door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I think you should get ready for the worst.<eos> -Are you staying a week?<eos> -No, just tonight.<eos> This is too much.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> This is the room. I told you it was being done up.
How long do you think you're gonna last out there once the word gets out?<eos> Are you a man of honor?<eos> Sure.<eos> See, let me tell you.<eos> All I want now is what I had in my life before all the fuckers came through the door - you and them.<eos> I wanna be left alone with my family, and I want a job that feels good to me.<eos> So if that means I need to deliver up this Junior Brown, I'll do that.<eos> If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there, I will.<eos> But all I've got on you is your word.<eos> So I'm asking you: if I serve him up as a man of honor, will you say to me now that you will cut me loose once and for all?
-And?<eos> -You did good. I'm happy for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Careful, Hank.<eos> I am humbled by the trust I've been given in being appointed Nova's new CEO.<eos> I vow to lead Nova and its new acquisitions... with integrity and vision, into a prosperous future.<eos> In the furore following the allegations surrounding Eloy Agustin last week... Intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to Manuel Pla.<eos> Señor Agustin, meanwhile... is under investigation by the Chief Magistrate's office.<eos> This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV signing off.<eos> Didn't your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
A drum!<eos> You're ahead, Mr. Russ!<eos> Get on the beat, Mr. Russ.<eos> Whoa, whoa, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> What happened? Where did you go?<eos> I keep losin' my place.<eos> Well, why don't you find it?<eos> Enough of us here already think that time is a magazine.<eos> And I don't want you confusing us any further. And by the way...<eos> Mr. Barr, it is not... as they say, considered couth... to empty your spit valve in the middle of the performance... especially not on the foot of the person sitting next to you.
Betty Grable.<eos> See?<eos> It says here, she, uh... She finished filming- - How old are you?<eos> - What, Mr. Young?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Me, I'm 24.<eos> I think I am too.<eos> No, you're, uh...<eos> Mr. Young?<eos> Would you like me to keep reading to you?
I would remind you, young man Henri Young is the one on trial here, not me.<eos> I am a public servant.<eos> I am not the bad guy.<eos> Silence, Mr. Glenn.<eos> Mr. Stamphill, you are perilously close to contempt of this court.<eos> You will proceed with caution. Is that understood?<eos> Temper, temper.<eos> Well, would you care to withdraw any testimony?<eos> You wouldn't want somebody to come along and testify to the contrary, would you?<eos> I would not withdraw any testimony, no matter what Henri Young has told you.
So you barge in on strangers? Is that what you do?<eos> - I'm looking for my nephew Thomas.<eos> - Who's Thomas?<eos> I know he's been here.<eos> You can't fool me.<eos> I don't know anyone named Thomas.<eos> Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole.<eos> My nephew.<eos> You mean Rashid?<eos> Rashid? Is that what he told you his name was?
That's nice.<eos> I just took a reservation from--<eos> -My grandson.<eos> -Yes, that's what he said.<eos> Three seats this afternoon to....<eos> -Tokyo.<eos> -Yes!<eos> I have your authorization for three first-class children's tickets to Tokyo, totalling $1 1,364?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Is this amount okay with you?
- Toast, please!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Bye, pal.<eos> - Daddy. lt won't float!<eos> It's not supposed to float, it's a submarine. lt goes under water.<eos> Hello?<eos> When?<eos> I thought I had the flu.<eos> I'd still think so if they weren't telling me otherwise.<eos> What are they telling you?
Hey, Ting En.<eos> What about Miss Shien?<eos> You're going to leave her after all she's done?<eos> You buy her out.<eos> - Get the Madam.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We'll pay.<eos> I guess you won't be wearing all those fancy dresses anymore.<eos> No, but I really won't miss them.<eos> That one fits you well, and it looks so good on you.
I mean, there are literally hundreds of women out there looking for a guy just like you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town?<eos> Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.<eos> So, why are you covering this story?<eos> Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick. - Oh. - I'm starving to death.<eos> I'm looking to become a real reporter.<eos> Look, Stanley, when you were at Ripley Auto, did you see anything suspicious? Anything at all?<eos> I won't make trouble for you. I just want the truth.
-So am I.<eos> That ought to be fun.<eos> Lord knows what he'd have done, alone in the stage for two days.<eos> I hope you can relax and enjoy the journey now.<eos> See, my feeling is that if there weren't any women... ... noneofus wouldbehere .<eos> What kind of sense does that make?<eos> If there were no men, we wouldn't be here either.<eos> Are you mocking me?<eos> Don't get ruffled.<eos> I was agreeing with you in a totally unusual way.
That means you can't enter.<eos> If it was within my power, I'd give you that money in a heartbeat.<eos> The problem is, I'm $2,000 short myself.<eos> And my poor, pure heart... ... wasjustsetonit.<eos> This wine is for peasants!<eos> Well, set on this, Mrs. Bransford.<eos> Just stay as pure as you are right now and I'll be back soon.<eos> Hunting savages, isn't that dangerous?<eos> It's primitive... ... butI likekilling.<eos> Excuse me, but may I speak with you?
After today, Waltzer doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Nice chains, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> My dad's in therapy, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dad, please, you lost.<eos> You chained yourself to the truck two days ago, and the local paper didn't even show up.<eos> Tom, you unchain yourself, nobody's pressing charges. Please, Dad.<eos> We have to cut you free, you're going to jail. Dad!
You are him.<eos> Crazy or not, here or gone, you're Santa Claus.<eos> Only if the children believe that.<eos> And what kind of Santa Claus were they believing in, anyway?<eos> They can't look to me anymore, not after knowing what happened the other night.<eos> Well, think about the other night.<eos> A man was there to photograph the incident.<eos> The man you hit was the man you replaced.<eos> The cops told me this, Kriss.<eos> The cops believe in you.
- You're too nice.<eos> - No, I'm not. - lf it were up to me, I would've sent him to the skating rink the fast way.<eos> - Five sessions a week ?<eos> - Five, and not a dent.<eos> Herb is so angry with himself for losing, and it was on such a simple question too. - Marty.<eos> - Marty. His ego couldn't handle it.<eos> He blames Charles Van Doren for his downfall.<eos> And of course, the real downfall of Herbert Stempel has always been Herbert Stempel.<eos> Herbert Stempel. Absolutely. You met him.<eos> Does he seem stable to you ?
They've prescribed peridaxon.<eos> - But, sir, peridaxon...<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> It's not a cure.<eos> Nothing can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways.<eos> You think I'm senile, that all this is just a delusion.<eos> Now, come on, Captain.<eos> No one said anything of the kind.<eos> In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me.<eos> However, there is nothing to disprove what you are saying. So it is possible something is happening to you.
Alright.<eos> Set a course for the Devron system, warp 13.<eos> Once more for old times' sake?<eos> Engage.<eos> Engage to where, sir?<eos> Set a course for the Devron system and engage at warp nine.<eos> The Devron system is inside the Neutral Zone, sir.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Carry on, Chief.<eos> Captain, may I have a word with you in private?
- Excuse me.<eos> This information has become classified.<eos> No information is to be passed on to civilians without my express permission.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Colonel O'Neil.<eos> You owe me an explanation.<eos> I was told I had complete autonomy.<eos> Plans change.<eos> Why did they bring you on this project?
Did you look for me?<eos> During the entire show.<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow. I wanted to say good-bye.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> I'd like you to tell me in detail about that dream you had.<eos> You were 50 years old, and you were happy.<eos> In this dream... was there anyone else?<eos> There was.<eos> Who?<eos> You woke up... and smiled at someone next to you.
Please, or I will never forgive you.<eos> You shouldn't talk that way to me.<eos> Well, you never let me talk.<eos> Honey, not now.<eos> Mr. Chan...<eos> Don't you turn your back on me.<eos> OK.<eos> Roll it up tight to keep it nice and fresh and keep it close to your heart...<eos> Like that.<eos> Remember what I told you and have a nice day.
What can I do?<eos> Professors have a lot of time to think and think and rethink.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Good girl.<eos> You like them all, don't you think I know?<eos> Damn you, want it to go soft again?<eos> Right.<eos> Now the cigar.<eos> You know you shouldn't.<eos> The doctor said no smoking for you.
It's just a little shot to see that he sleeps. No.<eos> His mother specifically said...<eos> - I said no.<eos> - Do it.<eos> All done.<eos> He'll be asleep soon.<eos> - Would you let go of my arm?<eos> - You bitch!<eos> Hey, you can't do that!<eos> I know what's in that one. Do you know what's in this one? Or what's gonna happen to you when I stick you with it?
Assistants are named Arthur and Jeremiah.<eos> Those are new assistants but I'm the old one. I came right after mister land surveyor.<eos> What do you want, Joseph?<eos> When can my master go to the castle?<eos> Never.<eos> Alright.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Barnabas, the messenger.<eos> Honourable mister land surveyor, as you know, you have been accepted in castle's service<eos> Your direct chief is village's elder who will explain to you all the details about your duty.
Sure.<eos> I have important meeting.<eos> I need to put on my best robes.<eos> Have it cleaned well.<eos> I have come to you with an errand.<eos> Oh, mister schoolmaster.<eos> You are still here?<eos> I'm very sorry, I have important meeting tonight.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> It's just that mister elder has very warm soul and he is worried that you while waiting for the answer wouldn't do rash things due to your anxiety and he offers you to take place as school caretaker.
- Hang on.<eos> What's up?<eos> My name is Dr. Wrenn. And I'm going to try and get you out of here.<eos> After all my redecorating?<eos> Heh. No, I think I'll stay.<eos> There's a guard with a pair of swollen testicles who swears you wanted out of here.<eos> I, uh... Well I've changed my mind.<eos> I see.<eos> The crosses are a nice touch.<eos> They'd almost have to keep you here once they'd seen these wouldn't they, John?
There's no sentient life to threaten anyone.<eos> Nonetheless, it is not safe.<eos> I have passed through that sector.<eos> - Look elsewhere.<eos> - You want Sigma 957 for yourself.<eos> The Narn government can't exploit a world that far away.<eos> But you want to hold on to it anyway, out of sheer spite.<eos> Considering what you were told about me, I'm sure you believe that.<eos> Despite your long acquaintance with Sinclair, you're new here.<eos> Let me pass on to you the one thing I've learned about this place.
Yeah, some.<eos> Why?<eos> The Chief O'Brien I know is an expert in transporter technology.<eos> I'm not an expert.<eos> But I know as much as any Terran.<eos> - l hope that will be enough.<eos> - For what?<eos> A transporter will help us get back to our side.<eos> You're filling me up with this stuff just to get me to help you?<eos> - Everything I've told you is true.
Let him die slowly on the Promenade.<eos> Let his pleas for mercy echo through the corridors<eos> - for all Terrans to hear.<eos> - lntendant...<eos> Another word from you and you will die right beside him.<eos> And you...<eos> O'Brien...<eos> You tinkerer and putterer and fixer of broken things.<eos> You've been the perfect theta for years.<eos> What could possibly have gotten into you?
But you are in no position to bargain here, Commander.<eos> You want to prevent a war?<eos> You come back to Cardassia with me and you help me destroy the Defiant.<eos> I don't care who you are or what your name is.<eos> I'm sorry about lying to you, and I'm sorry about using you.<eos> It was an operational necessity.<eos> You were a resistance fighter.<eos> You do things you're not proud of to accomplish the mission.<eos> You've accomplished your mission, so now what?<eos> The Cardassians and Starfleet will be looking for you.
Give her another two cc's of benzocyatizine.<eos> Doctor... Her isoboramine levels are down to 51 percent.<eos> I don't understand it, a decrease that severe is usually the result of tissue damage.<eos> Commander, this Wormhole you've discovered-- have your people done any surveys of the diametric fields it generates?<eos> Yes, in fact, Dax did the most recent survey herself.<eos> I'd like to see those reports. Do you think there's any correlation between Dax's condition and the Wormhole?<eos> Something unusual is affecting her, and at this point we can't afford to rule anything out.<eos> If we can't get her isoboramine readings up to an acceptable level within 48 hours I'm afraid we'll have to remove the symbiont.<eos> But that Will kill Jadzia!<eos> I'm well aware of that, Commander but Jadzia would be the first to tell you that our primary responsibility must be to the symbiont.
I think you're a con artist, or you're covering up an empty coin purse.<eos> I happen to know its both.<eos> Well, we can't be all as successful as you are.<eos> [chuckles] Too true.<eos> Some kind of game?<eos> I've never seen that one before.<eos> How do you play?<eos> Just press the key.<eos> Too bad.<eos> As I told you, my luck's running good today.
I'll keep my eye on him.<eos> I suppose it's time to go.<eos> Here. it doesn't belong to me.<eos> I can't keep it.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> You may not be my daughter, but until I find lliana, you're the closest thing I have to family.<eos> I want you to know something.<eos> In spite of whatever I might have said, I realise now you're an honourable man.<eos> And I think your daughter must have loved you very much.
- So you keep saying.<eos> Check our ship's logs and they'll prove it to you.<eos> Logs can be tampered with.<eos> You know that. You claim to be a security officer.<eos> I am a security officer.<eos> If we were guilty we wouldn't be here.<eos> I'll prove it.<eos> Computer, one to beam up.<eos> Don't worry, he'll be right back.<eos> What did I tell you?
I just thought you'd like to know who it was that you killed in self-defense.<eos> Sure.<eos> His name was Kozak, by all accounts a thoroughly disreputable character.<eos> Well, sounds like someone who was going to get himself killed sooner or later.<eos> It's a shame it had to happen here.<eos> Hmm, isn't it?<eos> I thought you'd also like to know that Kozak wasn't just some drifter passing through.<eos> In fact, he was the head of a Klingon family a rather powerful family, from what I can gather.<eos> Now, do you want to change your story or do you want to wait for Kozak's family to show up and ask to see the Ferengi bartender who killed him?<eos> I told you what happened, Constable.
She says she doesn't know.<eos> - l believe her.<eos> - Because Vulcans don't lie?<eos> - As a rule.<eos> - They don't blow up ships as a rule.<eos> But let's assume she's telling the truth.<eos> You haven't shared this information with the Central Command?<eos> - l haven't.<eos> - Good.<eos> They would never trust you to handle this.
Yes, of course.<eos> Tell me, Odo, have you made good use of the arboretum?<eos> In what way?<eos> By assuming the various shapes surrounding you.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> To become a thing is to know a thing.<eos> To assume its form is to begin to understand its existence.<eos> Understand it?<eos> How?<eos> Living among the solids has damaged you far worse than I realized.
The air currents beneath my wings the exhilaration of soaring above the treetops.<eos> Oh, it was all... very stimulating.<eos> I'm so happy fol' you I know you are.<eos> So, I guess this means you'll be staying here a while.<eos> I've enjoyed working with you, Major.<eos> I've enjoyed working with you, too, Odo.<eos> But, before we say good-bye, I need your help one last time.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Remember that power source I was telling you about?<eos> The one preventing you from trying to contact Commander Sisko.
- l see your point.<eos> - Then meet me at 0200 hours.<eos> Quark always makes his clandestine calls after the bar closes.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Quark, you parasite.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> is Hartla still working for you?<eos> The dabo tables wouldn't be the same without her.<eos> What I wouldn't give to see her again!<eos> I'm sure she misses you too.
That may work in your courts, but not here.<eos> There will be no new evidence considered.<eos> Call the first witness!<eos> Look, we're not after the Maquis.<eos> We're just trying to help an innocent man.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> People saw you talking to O'Brien just before he left.<eos> Since when is that a crime?<eos> We're old friends from the Rutledge.<eos> Doesn't it bother you that an old friend will be executed?
Perhaps it would be best if I left him alone.<eos> Let him come to me if he wants to.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> But I think you should consider this.<eos> Are you doing the best thing for Jason or what's easiest for you?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hello, Jason.<eos> I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor.<eos> Come in.<eos> Did Capt Picard ask you to come talk to me?
Sisters.<eos> Lursa?<eos> B'Etor?<eos> - Do you know where they are?<eos> - We were hoping you did.<eos> Maybe I do.<eos> Would you share that with us?<eos> My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing.<eos> But I'd consider a trade.<eos> Does your code tell you that when you're stranded, you shouldn't try to cut deals?
What are you planning to do?<eos> Lieutenant Ro. Go ahead, sir.<eos> Please report to the Bridge.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Captain.<eos> You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention.<eos> Well, to tell you the truth l-I really want to see everyone. I would just rather do it one at a time.<eos> Well, you look very fit, Lieutenant.<eos> Tactical training seems to agree with you. Well, you know me.
And this is my life.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> I won't change my mind.<eos> - Please leave me alone.<eos> - There's something wrong here.<eos> This is more than a love affair that has got out of hand.<eos> Tell me, why has no one seen this Ronin except you?<eos> Alright, Captain.<eos> Here I am.<eos> I believe Beverly asked you to leave her alone.
You'll just have to wait for the man to finish, OK?<eos> - Mommy...<eos> - Baby, you're bleeding.<eos> Come on, tilt your head back.<eos> I told you to leave it alone. OK?<eos> Now, don't touch it or it'll bleed again.<eos> Tilt your head back. There you go.<eos> Lucky we had a Kleenex, eh?<eos> Good girl.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Can you step outside, Mr Odin?<eos> We're placing you under arrest.<eos> Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine?<eos> Are you familiar with inhumane treatment of beef and dairy cattle?<eos> Just answer the question, Mr Odin.<eos> Yes, I know it.<eos> But I've never prescribed it or administered it.<eos> - Have you ever ordered others to do so?<eos> - No.<eos> Do your beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge, physically or psychically,... ..on those who might not share them?
- So, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> - Yeah. 8.30 sharp.<eos> Howdy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry to come unannounced.<eos> Gary's not home right now.<eos> Actually, we wanted to talk with you, if that's OK.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> You think Dr Larson was doing some kind of tests on Gary?<eos> Well, thinking back, was there anything that seemed strange to you?
They concur with my opinion that you're ready to be released... Mm. ..and rejoin the community.<eos> So...<eos> ..why don't we get some sleep and relax... ..and I'll see you tomorrow at the review, OK?<eos> Let's just keep our fingers crossed.<eos> Agent Scully,... ..we have reviewed your reports and frankly we are displeased.<eos> Irregular procedure, untenable evidence,... ..anonymous witnesses, inconclusive findings aggravated by vague opinion.<eos> The nature of X-Files cases often precludes orthodox investigation.<eos> Do you suggest we adopt separate standards for you and Mulder?<eos> No.<eos> Does Agent Mulder obstruct you from proper procedure?
He's been beaten up pretty badly.<eos> Contusions, multiple lacerations.<eos> The shoulder's been pulled right out of joint.<eos> Let's get him prepped for some blood work and X-rays.<eos> He's been kicked in the jaw.<eos> It may be fractured.<eos> There's a partial shoe print.<eos> I wanna get a photo of that.<eos> We might be able to find the shoe that matches it later.<eos> Do you know who did this to you?
Better half of something than all of nothing.<eos> Done.<eos> See you on the 15th.<eos> Thank you again for your services.<eos> Someday I am going to find the guy that thought up the idea of renting telepaths to businessmen, and I am going to kill him.<eos> Funny, I just knew you were going to say that.<eos> - Lyta Alexander?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Ambassador G'Kar, of the Narn regime.<eos> - May I speak to you for a moment?
You don't have to turn it off.<eos> Yeah, it's just-- I can't watch it.<eos> It should be me up there.<eos> It will be, baby, it will be.<eos> What is it?<eos> Uh, nothin'.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> The headaches should diminish little by little.<eos> Now, it's important that you do the eye exercises I gave you.
O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior to take that honor 2 years in a row.<eos> The guy's a dick, right?<eos> Yeah, he's kind of a joke.<eos> He's not a bad guy to have on your side.<eos> Did you get it bad when you were a freshman?<eos> - Shit, man!<eos> They waited for my ass after baseball. It was vicious.<eos> It's best to get a lot at once, 'cause after 10 licks, your ass is so numb, it's best to get it over with.<eos> I had some pretty cool seniors.<eos> They'd take you out, bust the hell outta you and get you drunk.
Easter Eve. So sad.<eos> To perk me up, I've eaten a ton of candies.<eos> Wet, isn't it?<eos> And chilly.<eos> Candy?<eos> Going to the movies or waiting for somebody?<eos> don't know about you... But I feel very lonely.<eos> Shall we join our loneliness?<eos> You are curvy.<eos> But that dress suits you.
Mr. Lee, let's just start off with what he looked like.<eos> White man, white shirt, tie.<eos> -What color was his tie?<eos> -Color?<eos> I don't know color.<eos> The guy attack me, okay?<eos> He bust up my store.<eos> I'm lucky to be alive.<eos> Just try and relax.<eos> What did he steal from you?
Do you have any idea why Kimble would be interested in these photographs?<eos> No.<eos> Where were they taken?<eos> Gee, that's a big fish!<eos> Cancun, Mexico.<eos> It was a junket the company paid for some doctors.<eos> -Kimble go with you?<eos> -You don't see him there, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I told you I don't know him.
U.S. Marshal Service.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> This is Fredrick Sykes.<eos> He's a security specialist at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.<eos> Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.<eos> Do you know this man?<eos> No, I don't know him.<eos> You're getting pretty desperate, aren't you, Mr. Gerard?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.
I'll fill out the application.<eos> You got any family?<eos> Anybody to worry about you?<eos> - Friends?<eos> Anything like that?<eos> - I got nobody.<eos> You'll deposit 500,000 dollars in our account in a bank in the Cayman Islands.<eos> Do not refer to our agreement by telex or in conversations on the phone.<eos> You'll be provided with a guide, trackers and the weapon of your choice.<eos> Naturally, we will dispose of the body... and provide you with an out-of-town, airtight alibi.
Come here.<eos> - No, I don't wanna get involved.<eos> - But this is who I... - No, really.<eos> I'm gonna... Come on.<eos> Your mother and my mother wound up in the same emergency room.<eos> My parents told me that before she died, she was talkin' about her kids... and all she wanted was to make sure that her kids were all right.<eos> And she sang that song. - I guess she was delirious by then.<eos> - Hug-a-bug - But my mom taught it to me. - Hug-a-bug Bear<eos> So when I heard you singing it, I just knew.<eos> Your mother loved you very much.
Is your legal counsel not with you?<eos> - I was told that this was an informal meeting.<eos> Isn't that right? - Oh, no, that's correct.<eos> William, why don't you begin?<eos> Why didn't you go to the mother and make sure that Charles had told her about the tutoring?<eos> Because I... - You've never taught, have you?<eos> - Taught?<eos> - You can't teach a thing without giving away your trust.<eos> - I don't follow.<eos> Let's say I was teaching you, as a lawyer, to be honest.
-Sit down. We're going to the theater.<eos> Jack, you were there when Mrs. House died, right?<eos> You saw her?<eos> - You saw her? - She was lying on the floor.<eos> - You're sure it was her, right?<eos> - I'm sure. - He's sure.<eos> - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> My wife's had bad dreams and doesn't know what she's talking about.<eos> This is for the times I call you to fix the faucet and you show up months late.
May I take this opportunity to welcome you to Castle Rock on the good Lord's behalf?<eos> - Why not? - Excellent. It's my unusual urgency when I ask, what faith, sir, are you?<eos> - What faith?<eos> - Religion. - You're not Catholic, are you?<eos> - You might say that I am nondenominational.<eos> - I knew it!<eos> Then you will have little objection to my placing this in your front window.<eos> I couldn't possibly do that.<eos> You see, I, like you, am here to serve everyone.<eos> However, by way of compensation perhaps I may offer you something, which might interest you.
- Many things.<eos> What do I love most about the law?<eos> Every now and again, not often, but occasionally, you get to be a part of justice being done.<eos> It really is quite a thrill when that happens.<eos> Thank you, Andrew.<eos> You said earlier you aspired to be a person of adventurous spirit. - Is that correct?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - Do you take risks?<eos> - In this job you have to.<eos> Did your doctor ever tell you to reduce stress? That long hours at work might speed up your illness?
What do you mean, his friend? This thing's a machine.<eos> Look, if OCP just wanted a robot, why the hell did they put Murphy in there in the first place?<eos> Murphy's dead, sweetheart.<eos> That's on record.<eos> Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy.<eos> What's left of his face, portions of the cerebrum, the cerebellum, it's human tissue that's still alive.<eos> How can you interface human components with a machine and then complain when the human part makes a decision?<eos> Okay. So, not only did we get Murphy's years of training and his law enforcement skills, we also inherited his... His memories, his feelings, his emotional baggage?<eos> Well, I'd call it his humanity, but I don't think you know that word. I see, well...<eos> Tell you what, Doctor, you talked me into it.
- Sure, man.<eos> Allow me, scum.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Where's McDaggett?<eos> He's coming out tonight That does not look like a police station.<eos> You're damn right, I'm not at the police station.<eos> If my spy hadn't warned me, I'd be dead now.<eos> I thought your damn ninja was supposed to take care of Robocop for me.<eos> That's the deal. I clear the area, he keeps the robot off my back.<eos> You have the device I had sent you?
Clearly label it.<eos> He's on the list. He is?<eos> Well, let's find him.<eos> I'm sorry. You can't have him.<eos> He's on the list.<eos> If he were an essential worker he would not be on the list.<eos> I'm talking to a clerk.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Sir, the list is correct.<eos> I didn't ask you about the list.
That should do it for a while.<eos> Shields are at 18% and falling.<eos> I might be able to give you one more phaser blast.<eos> No.<eos> Signal the lead ship that we will proceed with...<eos> Major, I'm picking up a huge neutrino disturbance off the forward docking ring.<eos> It's the wormhole.<eos> On screen.<eos> Hail the lead ship.<eos> What did I tell you, Jasad?
Anything we can do to make your lives easier.<eos> Isn't the baby a little young for dolls?<eos> It's for me.<eos> It's a post-feminist doll.<eos> Goes to work with little sneakers on, but resents it.<eos> -Night.<eos> They're really very interesting people.<eos> Come on.<eos> I no working with him! I no working with him, you bitch!<eos> You expect me to believe some bum approached you... with information that Mr. Blue is coming here tonight?
- As a matter of fact, she was.<eos> - A woman?<eos> I don't remember her name, but she was attached to the command post at Terok Nor.<eos> is there anything else, Doctor?<eos> The boy accused him of being a butcher.<eos> He hates Cardassians, sir.<eos> Pa'Dar was heartbroken.<eos> I can only imagine how I'd feel in his shoes.<eos> Commander, can I ask a few questions?<eos> Didn't Pa'Dar tell you about the humiliation he feels right now?
That's ridiculous.<eos> It would have been easier on me, Commander, had you not raised that point, but the penalty for these crimes on your planet is death and that is permanent.<eos> So before I grant extradition, you will convince me that the person named in your warrant is the person who is standing here now.<eos> She doesn't seem to care if she gets out of this.<eos> I care.<eos> Doctor, we've given the opposition access to our computers and station library so let's utilize them ourselves.<eos> Find all the medical evidence you can to support the theory that Jadzia Dax and Curzon Dax are two separate people.<eos> Excuse me, sir. I don't know that there is any evidence.<eos> Assume there is, then find it.<eos> I'm not asking you to be an attorney but if you could check the computers for any precedents, legal decisions involving Trills.
Well, what can we do?<eos> You prove the Valerians are dealing in weapons-grade dolamide and the Federation will use all diplomatic means to stop them.<eos> You think that'll work?<eos> It will if the Valerians want to continue trading with us.<eos> All right.<eos> - We'll try it your way.<eos> - Good.<eos> Then see to it that the Valerian ship is cleared for docking.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Chief, I have a subspace message for you from your wife.
This was the work of a disturbed and violent mind who listened to you, not the Prophets.<eos> is the Emissary holding me responsible for this act of terrorism?<eos> The Commander of this station is.<eos> May the Prophets forgive you for abandoning them.<eos> You claim the Prophets as your personal constituency, Vedek Winn.<eos> I'm not convinced that's justified.<eos> Who do you speak for?<eos> An order your Assembly barely listens to.<eos> So you come here for a more receptive audience.<eos> is that what your friend Vedek Bareil told you?
The way he stands, the way he moves, talks.<eos> - He's better than he was.<eos> - I'm glad you think so.<eos> I do.<eos> Really?<eos> The way he dismissed you?<eos> - Verad never did that.<eos> - He's under a lot of stress.<eos> Verad was under stress when he arrived.<eos> - He never turned on you.
Benjamin, I guess this is goodbye.<eos> Not many friendships last over two lifetimes.<eos> I wish we could have made it three.<eos> You'll see me again, Verad.<eos> So, where's this rendezvous going to be?<eos> You don't expect me to tell you?<eos> No, but I hope you like it there. You'll be waiting a long time.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - You told me yourself.<eos> I saw your face when he asked you to wait.
No one has re-examined the ideas of Nathaniel Teros.<eos> Until now.<eos> This...could actually work?<eos> No more servo controls, no more chair...<eos> - Have I done something wrong?<eos> - Not that I'm aware of.<eos> - We have something in common.<eos> - We do?<eos> I don't like Quark, either, but I can't let you kill him.<eos> Did he tell you I was going to do that?
I got to remember that.<eos> Mullibok, listen.<eos> One of these days I'll have to finish up that kiln.<eos> Then I can temper my baking pots, put some colourful lids on them.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> I appreciate you're trying to hang on.<eos> I sympathise, but you can't stay here.<eos> Tapping the crust will release carbon and sulphur.<eos> It will make the air unbreathable.<eos> The Cardassians probably told you you didn't stand a chance either.
- lt's latinum.<eos> I really can't accept this.<eos> Did Zek think this would get him anywhere?<eos> It doesn't stop a Ferengi from trying.<eos> - You sound like you admire them.<eos> - l suppose in a way I do.<eos> I don't understand your attitude about the Ferengi.<eos> You don't socialise with them the way I do.<eos> I can't think of a single race I've enjoyed more.<eos> Did anyone ever tell you you have very strange taste?
I don't want to discuss it.<eos> Let's concentrate on the Dominion.<eos> I wish Zyree had told us more.<eos> Maybe it's some planetary alliance or trading consortium.<eos> Whatever it is, it's important and I want a piece of it.<eos> I really wanted those tulaberries.<eos> My trip had nothing to do with tulaberries.<eos> - l must speak with you, brother.<eos> - Can't you see I'm busy?<eos> Does the word "Dominion" mean anything to you?
The Navarch needed to return here to assume his new post.<eos> He's been made the Bajoran liaison officer to Deep Space 9.<eos> - l already have a liaison officer. - Not any more, you don't.<eos> Major Kira is no longer assigned to this post.<eos> She's been recalled to Bajor.<eos> And now, the continuation.<eos> Frankly, Commander, I'm surprised at your reaction.<eos> - Not much surprises you, Minister.<eos> - l expected you to be celebrating.<eos> Major Kira has been trouble to you.
That distance is getting closer.<eos> The Circle is for real, Major.<eos> They've been armed for a coup.<eos> I'm not convinced that the military will back the provisional government.<eos> I didn't realise.<eos> We've been so isolated.<eos> - l guess I'd better get back.<eos> - Commander...<eos> Me, too.<eos> I told you I haven't given up.
- Lwaxana Troi, the Ambassador?<eos> - That's her.<eos> There was an incident that I helped her with, and now she's... grateful.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> The manner in which she expresses her gratitude.<eos> To be honest, Commander, she seems interested in me.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> She's extremely aggressive.<eos> I see.<eos> So she's after you.
It all comes down to how we define life-form.<eos> Just as biological organisms have evolved in our cultures, mechanical life could have done the same in others.<eos> You're suggesting someone left a baby at our doorstep?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Do you think we can communicate with it?<eos> We already have.<eos> It's part and parcel of our computer now.<eos> It may not be capable of direct communication.<eos> We haven't seen any evidence that it is sentient.<eos> Maybe more like a stray puppy that's attached itself to you, Chief.
Well, I was very impressed, Doctor.<eos> And well you should have been.<eos> I impressed myself on that one.<eos> What other doctor would consider examining the scapular nodes?<eos> I just seem to have a talent, I suppose - a vision that sees past the obvious, around the mundane, right to the target.<eos> Fate has granted me a gift, Major.<eos> A gift to be a healer.<eos> - l feel privileged to be in your presence.<eos> - Glad to have you along.<eos> Did anyone ever tell you that you're...?
Sure, I would.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Tell me where it is, I'll have a look.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I have to show you.<eos> There is no way you could find it.<eos> The next time you lie, I'll save Ah-Kel the trouble of killing you.<eos> There's that hard word again.<eos> There are times when I don't dissemble.<eos> Whatever you call it, the truth isn't in you.
It will take me 12 hours to reach the camp.<eos> - I may have to travel at night.<eos> - That would be unwise.<eos> This is not an empty jungle.<eos> There are many predators.<eos> - I am prepared.<eos> - Very well.<eos> But I recommend that you look up from time to time.<eos> The arboreal needle snake likes to attack from above.<eos> I will provide you with a map of the camp.
I was curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact.<eos> So far, it has proved to be most illuminating.<eos> And profitable!<eos> Can we get this over with, please?<eos> It's your bet.<eos> - I raise 50.<eos> - Blast!<eos> I fold.<eos> I fold as well.<eos> The uncertainty principle will not help you now, Stephen.
Another minute and we would have had them.<eos> - Riker to any team leader.<eos> - Powell here, sir.<eos> Round up everyone and take cover.<eos> Try to avoid contact with the Borg.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> - Riker out.<eos> Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space, it'll be a few days until Starfleet can get any ships here.<eos> Until then, we're on our own.<eos> Data, you must realise that something has happened to you.
It's not too late.<eos> If you remove the fibres, Geordi could recover.<eos> - That would not be possible.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because Lore tells you so?<eos> It is for the greater good.<eos> Good?<eos> Data, isn't good and bad, right and wrong, a function of your ethical program?<eos> That is correct.<eos> What does that program tell you about what you're doing to Geordi?
Break a leg.<eos> I'll try not to take you literally.<eos> - You're becoming agitated.<eos> - You bet I'm agitated!<eos> I may be surrounded by insanity but I am not insane.<eos> Nothing you or anyone else can say will change that!<eos> And I won't let you tell me that I am.<eos> You may be able to destroy my mind. But you can't change the fact that I'm innocent.<eos> I didn't kill that man!<eos> And that's what's driving you crazy.
It's gonna take him a while to recover.<eos> Number One, do you remember what happened?<eos> You were abducted during the mission to Tilonus IV and put into a psychiatric hospital.<eos> - It's still bleeding.<eos> - It's minor.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We have been checking on the hospital administrator.<eos> Mr. Suna.<eos> It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions.<eos> We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you.
After what you did on Calder II, I doubt you have much of a future in Starfleet.<eos> Yes, I must say I've come to the same conclusion.<eos> Well, assuming that you were not my prisoner, what would you do now?<eos> I guess I'd start looking for a new career.<eos> There must be a place where someone with 15 years of Starfleet technical knowledge would be useful.<eos> You wouldn't know a place like that?<eos> Well...<eos> Well, possibly. However, one thing I've learned on these ships is to be cautious and never to blindly embrace what might appear to be good fortune.<eos> And right now, you're a rather large stroke of good luck.<eos> I haven't exactly sworn undying allegiance to you, either.
Now tell me why you needed to deprive the Captain of his Earl Grey.<eos> Earl Grey?<eos> No wonder you can't sleep.<eos> Computer, bring replicators back on line and give me a cup of herbal tea, blend number three, hot.<eos> You shouldn't drink a stimulant at this time of night.<eos> I think you'll like this.<eos> I've programmed seven other blends into the replicator.<eos> - You're bound to like one.<eos> - I look forward to sampling them.<eos> I'm sorry if the system blackouts we requested inconvenienced you.
This way.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Space, the final frontier.<eos> These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.<eos> Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,...<eos> ..to boldly go where no one has gone before.<eos> Do you think there's enough food, Data?<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Tomorrow, I'll take you on a tour of the operational centres and residential decks.
I hope you plan on remaining on board.<eos> There is much we need to understand about what has happened.<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> The point is, I'm here, eager to get on with life.<eos> Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminal behaviour is as unacceptable in the 24th century as in the 19th.<eos> And very much harder to get away with.<eos> Don't worry, Captain, my past is nothing but a fiction.<eos> The scribblings of an Englishman, dead for four centuries.<eos> I hope to leave his books on the shelf, as it were.<eos> If that is so, there are opportunities awaiting you that are beyond anything you have ever imagined.
I think Wilczek is smarter than this.<eos> He just signed a confession.<eos> How much proof do you need?<eos> This is a crime scene.<eos> You'll have to leave.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I ordered the subpoena.<eos> - That subpoena's been obviated.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Unless you've got a Code 5 clearance, I'm gonna have to ask you to turn back.
We'll extract a sample and, in two hours, confirm the identity of the donor.<eos> I... made them rush so you could have your check before you leave.<eos> Aw, I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Aw, what?<eos> Here.<eos> Bye.<eos> You were gonna leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Well, I came to say goodbye and to wish you luck.<eos> And to leave you with this little thought.<eos> I know Howard told you, and if it ever gets out, I won't waste my time trying to pin the source.
We'll just see about that.<eos> The lamp.<eos> Finders keepers, Abubu.<eos> Genie, no!<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> I got a new master now.<eos> Jafar, I order you to stop.<eos> But there's a new order now. My order.<eos> Finally, you will bow to me.<eos> We will never bow to you.
Real justice.<eos> For you.<eos> I have already forgiven them.<eos> Come on, lady. These guys put out cigarette butts on your...<eos> Get with the program.<eos> How could you...<eos> How could you forgive these mother... These... These guys?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How could you?<eos> Deep down inside, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you?
For a second, you really frightened me.<eos> Really?<eos> Honey, I'm home!<eos> Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.<eos> Selina, this is your mother.<eos> Selina, this is your mother.<eos> Why haven't you called me back?<eos> Hello, Selina Kyle.<eos> We're just calling to make sure you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.<eos> One whiff of this and your boss will ask you to stay after work for a candlelight staff meeting for two.
Just act and speak naturally<eos> It bothers me none.<eos> I was filmed once in Mons.<eos> There was an army band concert.<eos> I enjoyed that.<eos> That's fine, our subject is used to the camera.<eos> Just fine.<eos> May I ask my first question?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Tell me, Madam, among your friends and acquaintances, does anyone visit you regularly?
Even thought you move your menacing arms, you'll pay for it. The knight of the sad figure, on behalf of his loved Dulcinea, will take care of your bones, villains.<eos> Out, great riffraff. Surrender to my strong arm.<eos> Surrender to Don Quixote de la Mancha.<eos> I'll make you try my noble blade.<eos> War, war.<eos> Defend yourselves or give me your will.<eos> I'll die or you'll taste my blade.<eos> Die!<eos> Evil spirits, that turn the mills into giants.<eos> What did I told you, sir?
I don't know.<eos> On his birthday.<eos> When was that?<eos> May, I think.<eos> She don't like for me to see him.<eos> Thinks I'm a bad influence.<eos> I think you should see your son.<eos> Try to get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.<eos> Create the impression of a decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.<eos> And I know that you're having financial difficulties, Mr. LaPlante but I was wondering if the money that I loaned you last week...
Goddamn it!<eos> Fletcher, speak up.<eos> Don't be an asshole.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> My leg is caught.<eos> My leg is caught.<eos> Can you get me out of here?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Yeah, I think.<eos> Let me help you there.
You wouldn't have thought twice.<eos> That's the kind of guy you are.<eos> Trust me on that.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> The blackmail thing don't sound like a bad idea.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You still got some money.<eos> You didn't spend all the dough, did you?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> The TV lady thinks I'm blackmailing you because you swiped her purse.
Haven't eaten yet, I hope?<eos> Thai.<eos> My treat.<eos> Now, this way to the kitchen, I presume.<eos> - Caesar salad, perfect.<eos> - Would you tell me who you are?<eos> Where's my head?<eos> I know you, but you do not know me.<eos> My name is Addison Leach.<eos> Still doesn't tell you what I do, does it?
Exploration, curiosity, salvation...<eos> Spin a wheel, take a choice.<eos> Coming to you for answers, I'm crazy.<eos> For answers, come to my meeting tomorrow. Meet the experts.<eos> Abductees.<eos> All right, but I have a couple of people I want to bring with me.<eos> The more the merrier.<eos> Good to see you again, Doc.<eos> I knew you'd be back, but not quite so soon.<eos> What turned you around?
Oh, great. My wife...<eos> guys, let my wife in.<eos> I'm here. Oh.<eos> Come in number six, please, unit six.<eos> Unit six, here.<eos> Unit six, we have an ambulance rolling...<eos> I copy. I copy.<eos> Why did you guys call me, huh?<eos> You know I don't do this anymore.<eos> I thought I told you to go back to your husband.
It's foryour own good.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> You don't smoke, do you?<eos> There's got to be a cigarette around here somewhere.<eos> Is this supposed to be me?<eos> It's a very good likeness.<eos> Take it ifyou want.<eos> No, I'd ratheryou kept it.<eos> I certainly flattered you by idealizing your forehead.
I find it hard to believe that this was all simply an accident.<eos> I am aghast at this.<eos> There's an invisible man loose in the city.<eos> I want to find him too...<eos> ... so,whatarewedoinghere?<eos> -Take off your jacket.<eos> -Why?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Don't worry, doc.<eos> This won't hurt you a bit.
- No. I'm just trying to explain.<eos> - I don't wanna hear explanations.<eos> The State of Alabama has its procedure.<eos> And that procedure, at this point in time, is to have an arraignment.<eos> Are we clear on this?<eos> Yes. But there seems to be a great deal of confusion here.<eos> - Mr Gambini.<eos> - You see, my clients...<eos> All the way?<eos> All I ask from you is a very simple answer to a very simple question.
Not for me to say.<eos> No, sir.<eos> You can stand down.<eos> - Do you have any other witnesses?<eos> - No, Your Honour.<eos> The court finds sufficient evidence exists for this matter to go to trial.<eos> I'm setting this matter for trial this Monday, February 2, 10am.<eos> Mr Gambini.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Now, didn't I tell you next time you appear in my courtroom that you dress appropriately?
You got an open invitation any time you come here.<eos> - We can get us a deer next time. - OK.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I feel like if I don't get outta here now, I might never be able to leave.<eos> Mr Gambini.<eos> I have a fax here from the clerk of New York.<eos> I owe you an apology, sir.<eos> I'm honoured to shake your hand.<eos> "Win some, lose some."<eos> Your courtroom manner may be rather unconventional, but I gotta tell you, you're one helluva trial lawyer.
I was improvising on your security techniques.<eos> That's cute.<eos> That's real cute, Miss...?<eos> Slayton, but my friends call me Marti.<eos> Well.<eos> See if this had been a real gun, that Angie Dickinson bullshit you just pulled would've got your head blown off.<eos> And endangered the lives of all the other passengers.<eos> I was trying to save lives.<eos> The next time a man holds a gun to your head on a crowded plane you follow instructions.<eos> You do exactly what he tells you to do.
David!<eos> Hello? I'm really Sony. I forgot.<eos> He's gone out.<eos> - Oh, I see. - Who's this?<eos> This is Griffin Mill.<eos> Oh, the dead man.<eos> - What did you just say?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Oh, nothing. - About me being a dead man.<eos> Just, uh, a nickname David has for you.
And then I probably wouldn't even answer that question. - Hmm.<eos> - Why don't you ask your friend here? He's been following me all over the place. He'll probably know.<eos> All right.<eos> Paul, did Mr. Mill fuck June "Hudmuuhunta"?<eos> I didn't see him. Well, see, you got away with it.<eos> He didn't see you.<eos> - What are you implying? - I'm not implying anything.<eos> I asked you a direct question.<eos> Did you fuck her?<eos> And I told you I wouldn't answer that question without a lawyer in the room.
And great music.<eos> If you...<eos> I'll put it to you like this, and then I'll thank you for your time.<eos> My answer is no.<eos> Hi.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los Angeles, first class, please.<eos> And...<eos> Could you seat me next to a single guy?<eos> I think I'll put you in seat 3C.
Oh, God, no.<eos> Here you go, come on.<eos> Hey, nice to see you.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Battle stations.<eos> Monitor the audio. Grab the mike.<eos> Okay-<eos> I'm gonna remove my hand now.<eos> Please, do not scream.<eos> I promise nothing is going to happen to you.
It's just arrived by courier.<eos> From the Ministry of War...<eos> It must be the pension - I've been seeking all these years.<eos> At last, some recognition of my achievements.<eos> Dear Monsieur Bernard, courtesy demands that I inform you - of my having landed in such a predicament - that I am unable at this time to observe the custom - requiring me to pay my rent, especially when it's due.<eos> Until this morning I had hoped to honor this lovely day - by paying my rent.<eos> Delusion!<eos> As I slept cradled in false certainty, - misfortune, ananke in Greek, dashed my hopes.<eos> Sizable sums on which I had counted were not forthcoming - but our beautiful France and I will see better days - have no doubt of that.<eos> The moment we do, - I shall hasten to inform you of it - and to remove from my lodgings the precious possessions - I leave to your safekeeping and the law's - which restrains you from selling them for one year.
Professor!<eos> Left them speechless!<eos> They told me I talk like a priest.<eos> Know whatthey asked me?<eos> Equations, the third War of lndependence and Pascoli.<eos> Just what you taught me!<eos> I'm off to tell my brother.<eos> - Let's go together.<eos> -You stay here.<eos> The professors might want to congratulate you.
And I don't think you're a particularly good first officer.<eos> But you are also the best pilot on the ship.<eos> Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you, either.<eos> You are arrogant and closed-minded.<eos> You need to control everything and everyone.<eos> You don't provide an atmosphere of trust.<eos> You don't inspire people.<eos> You've got everyone wound up so tight, there's no joy in anything.<eos> I don't think you're a particularly good captain.<eos> I won't order you to fly this mission.
On my way.<eos> The transport ship Denver struck a gravitic mine. They've sustained damage.<eos> They attempted to crash-land on a planet in the Mericor system.<eos> - We'll arrive in seven hours.<eos> - How many were aboard?<eos> The Denver's crew complement is 23, but they were transporting 517 colonists to the Beloti Sector.<eos> Convert all shuttlebays into emergency triage centres.<eos> Civilians with medical training report for duty.<eos> Make it so.<eos> May I speak to you in private?
This may not be good medicine, but for Worf, it may be his only choice.<eos> I am ready, Commander.<eos> I've been studying this ritual of yours. Do you know what I've decided?<eos> I think it's despicable.<eos> I hate everything about it.<eos> Casual disregard for life, the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour.<eos> I may have to respect your beliefs, but I don't have to like them.<eos> It is not something I expect you to understand.<eos> All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away so you can kill yourself in peace.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna make it that easy for you.
When Timothy remembered similar procedures on his ship, I analysed shield output to wavefront amplification and discovered a correlation.<eos> If we had transferred all that power, it would have torn the ship apart.<eos> Status?<eos> - Navigation is back on line.<eos> - Full about.<eos> One-quarter impulse.<eos> Take us out of here.<eos> Timothy is a boy feeling great pain.<eos> But he is a boy again.<eos> Is this difficult for you, Data?
Bridge.<eos> How do you suggest we proceed?<eos> We need to adjust the scanner to penetrate the storms.<eos> Any ideas, Data?<eos> We can employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data.<eos> - Something wrong, Commander?<eos> - My apologies, sir.<eos> It seems my speech processes are experiencing a minor fluctuation.<eos> I will correct it in a moment.<eos> Captain, may I speak with you for a moment in private?
This is the food replicator and your computer terminal.<eos> Good Lord, man, where have you put me?<eos> These are standard guest quarters.<eos> - I can try to find something bigger.<eos> - Bigger?<eos> In my day, even an admiral wouldn't have had such quarters.<eos> I remember when we had to transport the Dohlman of Elas.<eos> You never heard anyone whine so much about quarters as she did.<eos> The holodecks, ten-forward and the gymnasium are at your disposal.<eos> The computer will tell you how to find them.
We think there are ways to reclaim some of our water.<eos> You're being a bit of an alarmist.<eos> True, we're in a drought, but water rationing has produced savings.<eos> If the weather doesn't change, we'll run out of water.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Kamin, sir.<eos> Kamin!<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> - No.<eos> I haven't spoken to you before.
Please, Captain, don't get up too quickly.<eos> Captain?<eos> This is the Enterprise.<eos> I'm Jean-Luc Picard.<eos> How long...?<eos> 20, 25 minutes.<eos> 25 minutes?<eos> !<eos> I want you in sickbay.<eos> I'd like to run a full diagnostic on you.
I should remain in my quarters.<eos> I have confidence in the self-control of my crew, but there are guests and civilians on board.<eos> I understand.<eos> I will volunteer to stay in my quarters on one condition. That you visit me.<eos> - There it is again.<eos> - What?<eos> The wall you put between us.<eos> Kamala, you are one day away from an arranged mating.<eos> Why would you want me to visit you in your quarters?<eos> I said a visit. I didn't ask you to make love to me.
I've never been.<eos> There was always somebody there to educate me in literature, history, art, sex.<eos> But I've been alone on this journey and I find myself thinking about the curious questions you asked.<eos> You wanted to know who I am.<eos> And as I ask myself, the only answer that comes is,<eos> "I am for you, Alrik of Valt."<eos> Because that's the truth.<eos> In a day, I will bond with a man I've never met.<eos> I will turn myself into what he wants me to be, for the rest of my life.<eos> I also once asked you if you were doing this of your own accord.
Proceed, Mr Data.<eos> - Mr Data.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Let me give you a hand with that.<eos> Once the force field is adjusted, I will no longer be visible.<eos> However, you will still be able to hear me.<eos> If you will help me test the comm system?<eos> My voice will go out on a delay correlated to the phase adjustment.<eos> That should allow me to maintain verbal contact.<eos> - Will we be able to talk to you?
You ever run into Halley's Comet?<eos> Gently.<eos> Now, don't sit up too quickly.<eos> Where'd everybody go?<eos> Well, I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now.<eos> But you're still here.<eos> You were hurt.<eos> I had to make sure you were all right.<eos> And so you stayed for that?<eos> I didn't want anything to happen to you.
Why is he here?<eos> - Stop! You're hurting me!<eos> - Can you see his face?<eos> Yes!<eos> Imzadi.<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> - You're hurting me!<eos> - Who is it?<eos> Who is doing this to you?
He wasn't anywhere near the Nel system.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hello, Jev.<eos> - We'll reach starbase soon.<eos> I wanted to say goodbye and to apologise again for my father.<eos> There's no need.<eos> You're not responsible for what he did.<eos> Before all this happened, I had hoped we might become friends.<eos> - We still can.<eos> - After what he's put you through?
Come this way if you will, please.<eos> This way.<eos> You will stay.<eos> The neutron detonator itself couldn't move me.<eos> If you will...<eos> What?<eos> Why did she do that?<eos> Oh!<eos> What's up?<eos> What did I tell you, sir?
- I don't understand...<eos> - I'm buying this house.<eos> - This house isn't for sale.<eos> Everything's for sale.<eos> - How much do you want?<eos> - Mr. Siegel... - Ben.<eos> - Ben...<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Are you going to hurt me?<eos> I would protect you from anyone who tried to hurt you.
Sing the blues.<eos> What exactly does that mean to you?<eos> A lounge act.<eos> Actually, I met this wonderful woman... in a clothing store... and I don't remember exactly what she said... but it feels right.<eos> I'm gonna sing.<eos> All right. You feel you'd like to sing.<eos> But why do you think a clerk in a clothing store... is having such a profound effect on you?<eos> No, no. She's not a clerk.<eos> I think she works in the butcher's shop... or something, but... she is so wise.<eos> Stella... a woman as intelligent and insightful as yourself... doesn't need some clairvoyant to tell you how to live your life.
But the thing is, I know he loves me.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Such sweet sorrow.<eos> God, love hurts!<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You mean to tell me that Leo broke it off?<eos> Maybe they're really not meant for each other.<eos> Who?<eos> Leo and Marina.<eos> I never told you her name was Marina.
but I can't really say that I've got much faith in all this crap.<eos> How come?<eos> Someone stole a car near the old people's home last night but that doesn't tell me a thing.<eos> Somehow I don't believe in geriatrics running around and stealing cars.<eos> If I were you I would start the search in the home itself.<eos> How about checking out the boiler room?<eos> You are coming with us.<eos> Who, me?<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?<eos> That should be perfectly clear to you.
Mr. Cady, I realize that you suffered.<eos> I understand your problem, but, I mean, why me?<eos> I was your lawyer. I defended you.<eos> Why not badger the D.A. or the judge?<eos> -"Badger."<eos> -Why not them?<eos> Best I remember, they was just doing right by their jobs.<eos> I didn't do my job?<eos> ls that right?<eos> I pleaded you out to a lesser occluded offense.
I can't tell.<eos> He's either out or in.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I can't see through walls.<eos> I'm not asking you to see through walls.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Why can't anybody do anything for me?<eos> What good are cops and laws--<eos> Sam, calm down.<eos> Let me explain something to you.
-Can I help you?<eos> -I just found it.<eos> Thought you might need it back.<eos> Not to frighten you, but if a dogcatcher comes across a dog without a license he's liable to think he's a stray and do God knows what to it.<eos> You know our dog is....<eos> -He passed away.<eos> -What a shame.<eos> Man's best friend and all.<eos> Woman's too.<eos> Even without closing my eyes, I can picture him big, friendly, shaggy, asleep at your feet keeping you company while you're trying to finish up those pesky little sketches.
- I can't put this in strong enough terms.<eos> I want him eliminated as an effective witness.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Are you prepared to do that?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Then you won't mind if I sit in? No.<eos> Great.<eos> Now, Mr Kellen, when the paramedics were pulling you out of the vehicle, how did it feel to be on fire?<eos> For Godsakes, you just asked me that question.<eos> No, sir, I believe I asked you if you remembered being on fire. And I asked you, when did you know you were on fire?
- What did he say?<eos> - Why do you want to know?<eos> Mr Baker, did Roman kill his wife?<eos> No.<eos> Although, at the time, I honestly thought he did, until I went to see him on death row.<eos> What did he say?<eos> - Can I have a cigarette? - I don't have any.<eos> What did he say?<eos> - In your pocket.<eos> - What did Roman tell you?

A problem which gives Sicily and Palermo in particular a bad reputation, ..in front of the world.<eos> You understood, didn't you, it's useless for me to tell you.<eos> I'm embarassed to bring this up.<eos> It's traffic.<eos> There are too many cars.<eos> Traffic is so intense, that we can hardly survive.. ..and makes enemies of us all, family against family. Too many cars<eos> Sorry if you had to face this traffic because of me.<eos> I'm just saying hi to Maria.. ..and I'll go to the hotel.<eos> - No, it was a pleasure.<eos> Maria made a room for you.
...that I never paid attention, that I was probably retarded and that I had a very limited future as a citizen of the United States.<eos> Then, a week later, she said I should probably skip second grade maybe even skip elementary school altogether.<eos> All I want is someone to eat lunch with.<eos> Fred Tate?<eos> All right. Let's all be good citizens and be very, very quiet for Fred.<eos> Oh, a visitor.<eos> How lovely to see you, Miss Tate.<eos> Fred and I are just getting ready to do a little duet.<eos> The kid's got an appointment.<eos> Then we'll just make it one quickie little verse, if that's all right with you.
- Want me to take these in the house for you?<eos> - No, that's okay.<eos> -Just put 'em over there, please. - No, I got it. It's my job.<eos> Okay, that'll be 33 bucks, please.<eos> Okay. Oh, no.<eos> Keep the -- Keep the change.<eos> - Listen --<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Now, this is gonna sound a little crazy to you, but, uh --
You'll see your father.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I won't go without her.<eos> Betty...<eos> You'll leave as soon as possible.<eos> You'll see your father and liquidate all our assets in the States.<eos> It's my money and I want it!<eos> Don't do it, Betty.<eos> You'll never see your daughter again.<eos> - He won't allow you back in the country.
The "Southern way"?<eos> My mother's immortal phrase:<eos> "When things get too painful, we either avoid them or we laugh. "<eos> When do you cry, according to the Southern way?<eos> We don't.<eos> Jesus, even Sally makes better chili than this.<eos> - I have a good recipe.<eos> Interested? - No, thanks. I never cook.<eos> What the hell is it with you doctors?<eos> Does " Callanwolde" mean anything to you?
He told you, don't get near the glass?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Clarice Starling.<eos> Nice to meet you, Clarice.<eos> You can hang your coat up there if you like.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.<eos> He's past the others, the last cell.<eos> You keep to the right.<eos> - I put out a chair for you.
Chief Sterns, i wonder if i might ask you... a few more questions off-the-record.<eos> Miss O'Neil, my record, on-the-record... clearly shows that i have no off-the-record record.<eos> - Make a record of that.<eos> Were there any large tooth or claw marks found here today?<eos> How did you know... that i don't know what you're talking about?<eos> i have reason to believe this damage was caused by two... two... really big animals.<eos> And what type of animals might these be, Miss O'Neil?<eos> - Well, i can't say exactly.<eos> - I see.<eos> Then what leads you to believe they did this?
It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.<eos> It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.<eos> Like what?<eos> - Knives and stabbing weapons.<eos> These were taken by a video surveillance camera... at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.<eos> He killed 17 police officers that night.<eos> Men with families... children.<eos> These were taken at a mall in Reseda... today.<eos> Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.<eos> I just sat here and told you that your son is missing... that the foster parents have been murdered.
Certain words and phrasee keep drifting through my mind.<eos> Thinge like incarceration, cavity search, death by electrocution, life imprieonment.<eos> Do I want to come out alive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> We're going to have to think about that.<eos> Louiee... I'll do anything.<eos> I know what's making you run.<eos> I know what happened to you in Texas.
There's a glass there.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - None of your business.<eos> You piece of scum, come back.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You wish.<eos> I'll get you.<eos> And now a musical welcome for our guests.<eos> Are you done at last?<eos> Do you want me to beat you up?
Just the two I'm looking for.<eos> I brought you the forms.<eos> Shouldn't take more than a few hours.<eos> We're busy.<eos> Tomorrow would be better.<eos> Data, we've got 23,000 thermal simulations.<eos> - Could you check for anomalies?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Is that as fast as he can go?<eos> Not fast enough for you?
I don't see why not.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> - You don't like me very much.<eos> - I don't dislike you, Professor.<eos> Keep your eyes wide, soldier.<eos> You'll tell your grandchildren you were at Penthara IV.<eos> But you don't trust me.<eos> - You should.<eos> - Should I?<eos> "Picard's empath won't trust you," they said.
Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders?<eos> How...?<eos> During the missing day,... ..were you contacted by Starfleet?<eos> Did they order you to conceal the truth from us?<eos> I cannot answer that.<eos> We must leave, sir.<eos> This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer.<eos> Now who gave you that order?<eos> You did, sir.<eos> I ordered you to lie?
And I'd probably still be there if I hadn't trusted one man.<eos> Come.<eos> Ensign Ro has some things to talk to you about.<eos> Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters.<eos> She can go back to her quarters when she's done.<eos> I don't know why you're involved, but...<eos> She's my friend.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> Guinan is very selective about whom she calls a friend.<eos> When I've finished telling you what I have to tell you, I'll probably end up back in the stockade.
Do you have any suggestions?<eos> Your top priority is to protect the Cardassian treaty.<eos> We can't protect the Cardassian peace without sacrificing the Bajoran.<eos> If that's your call, I'll support it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not willing to give them up.<eos> You're not looking at the big picture, Jean-Luc.<eos> We can't afford to lose the Cardassian treaty.<eos> I see a different big picture. It looks something like this.<eos> I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassian virus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion IV.
- I'm not afraid of you.<eos> - Good.<eos> There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> We shouldn't fear the unknown.<eos> We should embrace it.<eos> - Can you help me get out of here?<eos> - Are you really an alien?<eos> It's alright to tell me.<eos> No, I'm not an alien.<eos> I don't believe you. You are an alien.
My people are not ready to accept what you represent.<eos> What happened in the hospital proves that.<eos> And Krola is the best evidence of all.<eos> We must slow down and allow those who are like him to join us in the present before we can move into the future.<eos> But when we encounter other beings, our people must be ready!<eos> The warp programme will be delayed.<eos> We'll divert resources to education and social development to prepare for when we are ready.<eos> - Chancellor, I strongly disagree!<eos> - I know.<eos> Captain, you once said if I asked you to leave, you would do so without hesitation.
What type of radiation signature?<eos> Unknown, sir.<eos> The Alpha Omicron system has yet to be charted.<eos> I recommend we take this opportunity for further research.<eos> Well, we're way ahead of schedule.<eos> Alter course for Alpha Omicron.<eos> Dr. Brahms, there's no reason for us to argue.<eos> We're on the same side here.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> So, why don't I take you on a little tour. Show you the adjustments I've made why I think they work and we can begin pulling together on this?
That's amazing.<eos> I don't think anyone has ever...<eos> Sometimes I feel more comfortable with engine schematics than people.<eos> Well, maybe you just haven't met the right... people.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Why don't I just start dinner, okay?<eos> Commander...<eos> Please, call me Geordi.<eos> I'm sorry. I hope that I didn't put you to a lot of trouble but I can't stay.
Is something occupying your thoughts?<eos> You seem subdued.<eos> I bumped into Jeff in the turbolift this morning.<eos> - He asked me to dinner.<eos> - What was your response?<eos> I told him I'd think about it.<eos> As you requested,... ..l will now remind you why you ended your relationship.<eos> I guess I asked for this!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You objected that he did not set aside time for you.
It's dull, plodding, pedantic, like yourself.<eos> - I could help you with it.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> You've never been to the ruins at Tagus III, have you?<eos> No.<eos> They were sealed off over a century ago.<eos> Well, that explains it, then.<eos> How can you write about something that you've never seen?<eos> I know!<eos> Why don't I take you there?
Is Vash's life worth more than Data's or Troi's or Worf's?<eos> Worf, you'd make a perfect throw rug in Nottingham Castle.<eos> Q, end this before someone gets hurt!<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I've given this fantasy, as you call it, a life of its own.<eos> I have no more idea what will happen than you do.<eos> But of one thing I am absolutely sure.<eos> If you dare come to Nottingham Castle, blood will be spilt.<eos> You'll wear yourself out with all that pacing, milady!<eos> I told you to stop calling me that.
- Captain, we must intervene.<eos> The Duras family is corrupt, power-hungry, with no loyalty.<eos> They represent a grave threat to the security of the Federation.<eos> Captain,... ..you and I know that they have conspired with Romulans in the past.<eos> If they should be victors in this war, they would surely form a new Klingon-Romulan alliance.<eos> That would represent a fundamental shift of power in this quadrant.<eos> Starfleet must support Gowron.<eos> It is in the interest of both the Federation and the Empire.<eos> I beg you, support us in our cause.<eos> Mr Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle of non-interference.
- I cannot believe you mean this!<eos> - But I do.<eos> This must stop. It has gone too far.<eos> You lied about the engine room. There were no volatile chemicals.<eos> It was a tactic. A way of applying pressure.<eos> - We are hounding an innocent man.<eos> - And how have you determined that?<eos> I've talked with him.<eos> I see.<eos> He told you he was a victim of circumstance, blameless and pure?
Captain, warp engines are back on line.<eos> We are ready to commence restart sequences.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Yes, yes, of course.<eos> Proceed, Mr. Data.<eos> You alright, Captain?<eos> Yes, of course, Number One.<eos> Just a little preoccupied.<eos> Admiral Satie orders you to report to the interrogation room at 0900 hours.
Philosopher, scientist, poet, musician, duellist!<eos> Here lies Hercule Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac!<eos> I would not have you weep any less for that charming, good... and handsome Christian.<eos> I only ask this,... that as the great cold surrounds my bones, you allow a double meaning... for your mourning veil.<eos> And when you let fall your tears for him, some few... will be for me.<eos> That was a real improvement.<eos> Same time, day after tomorrow?<eos> Same time.<eos> Reg?<eos> May I join you?
Shelly Johnson.<eos> What a beauty.<eos> Kind of reminds me of that statue, the babe without the arms.<eos> - Venus de Milo. - The name was Milo, but that's beside the point.<eos> That's the kind of girl to make you wish you spoke a little French.<eos> Excuse me, Coop, while I try my hand at a little counter Esperanto.<eos> Good luck, Gordon.<eos> Hello.<eos> I was wondering if I might trouble you for a cup of strong, black coffee.<eos> And in the process, engage you with an anecdote of no small amusement.
Mr. Horne?<eos> Your secretary said to come in.<eos> Bobby Briggs.<eos> Bobby, you know what you have to have in this life?<eos> Balance.<eos> Distance.<eos> Symmetry.<eos> Look.<eos> It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?<eos> Mr. Horne, did you listen to that tape that I sent you?
- Wildlife?<eos> - Birds, owls?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, just moments before the major disappeared, I heard an owl.<eos> Any visual contact?<eos> Look, colonel, Garland Briggs is a good friend of mine.<eos> It would be a lot better if you'd just level with us.<eos> We know about the monitors and the messages from deep space that you received pertaining to me.<eos> You may know something, but you best get your facts straight.<eos> Our monitors are pointed at deep space, but the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you were sent from right here in these woods.
-She's too unresponsive.<eos> We have to pump your stomach!<eos> Do I have to be there?<eos> Nasty dream?<eos> Everybody has those.<eos> You'll have them for a while.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm Julie Marsden, director of the rehab unit. I'm here to admit you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Which part is confusing you?
On the advice of counsel, I decline to answer.<eos> Weren't you, in fact, intimate with the lady?<eos> On the advice of counsel, I decline to answer.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> "You have the right to remain silent."<eos> "Anything you say can and will be used against you."<eos> "You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning."<eos> "If you cannot hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you."<eos> "You may stop answering questions at any time."<eos> Do you understand the rights I have explained to you?
Come here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Look, I'm accused of doing something I didn't do.<eos> This trial is gonna give me a chance to clear myself.<eos> - That's what's gonna happen.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here are the postcards.<eos> - Don't forget to write. - They make me.<eos> What about me?<eos> Did Mr. Sabich ever tell you...
What did he say, if anything?<eos> He said he forgot.<eos> He forgot?<eos> Rusty forgot.<eos> Would it be fair to say the two of you, by working together...<eos> Have formed a personal friendship?<eos> I suppose so, yes.<eos> Were you assigned initially?<eos> Harold Greer initially handled the case.<eos> Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you...
Is he a group?<eos> Why don't you just start talking and let's see how it goes?<eos> Come on, Katya.<eos> You started this, I didn't.<eos> Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.<eos> I do jokes, I do bird noises, I drink.<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - I don't know what I may tell you.<eos> What did he tell you to tell me?
Just a little, uh, say 10,000 francs?<eos> Uh...5,000 perhaps.<eos> As a loan, of course.<eos> See, I'm not one of those... Stupid people who think that all Americans are millionaires.<eos> It's just that my mother's mad.<eos> She won't give me a penny.<eos> W-what am I supposed to do?<eos> Even 500 would keep me in smokes for a fortnight.<eos> I won't lend you money because I'd never get it back, and I haven't got it to give away.<eos> I can let you have 300 francs, if that's any use to you.
"And organic matters "such as peat,<eos> "leaf mold, compost, or rooted...<eos> rotted manure. "<eos> I think you've got it, Stanley.<eos> "And though spirit...<eos> "and the spirit of God<eos> "hovered over the face of the waters,<eos> "and God said let there be light, and there was light"!<eos> Amen.<eos> Shh! What's the matter with you?
- No! Put the weasel in jail.<eos> Nothing else matters.<eos> How about five or six million bucks?<eos> Your husband's share of the subdivision.<eos> Berman said he'd let you have it.<eos> - Could I make a phone call?<eos> - Please.<eos> That's what your lawyer told you to say to six million bucks?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You always do what he tells you?
Not necessarily.<eos> No.<eos> In other words, he loves you enough to kill somebody, but you're not surprised that he's fooling around?<eos> - What will a jury think of that?<eos> - Who is this woman?<eos> Mrs Berman, wouldn't you like to know one way or the other?<eos> If there's a relationship, I'd like to know about it, yes.<eos> Then you'll tell me what I want to know?<eos> What's that?<eos> Exactly what Bodine was asking you on the wire.
He told.<eos> - What?<eos> About three weeks ago, just after I came to work here, somebody else was in, asking about these people.<eos> And one of those people came back and broke his jaw.<eos> Him, right?<eos> All right.<eos> Forget about him.<eos> What about the guy who was asking?<eos> Can you remember what he looked like?<eos> I'll bet he asked you out.
Thank you.<eos> Before Mark got killed, he became aware of Berman's other associates.<eos> He was concerned that he might have a silent partner in this Mr Nice.<eos> Mark was frightened.<eos> He came to me for help, purely as a friend.<eos> - Frightened of Berman and Mr Nice.<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Not too frightened to sleep with Berman's wife.<eos> Tell you what we'll do, John.<eos> You tell me what the hell you think's going on, I'll tell you if I think you're right.
You've got to answer some questions.<eos> - Scotch and soda?<eos> - Fine.<eos> There's nothing I can tell you you don't already know.<eos> We'll see.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - How's your husband's health?<eos> Fine, obviously.<eos> Anything else?<eos> What did Mark Bodine ask you about Katherine Mulwray?
- What?<eos> I remember, my granddaddy told me how when you're lost in the desert you should sleep during the day and walk at night.<eos> Your granddaddy tell you that?<eos> He also tell you we'll die in the desert without those horses?<eos> What good are horses if we die first?<eos> Once in a while she actually makes a little sense.<eos> - What did you say, Roy?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> Good morning, Major.<eos> What can I get for you?
Well, I don't know...<eos> You've made your mark.<eos> Your question in the House started a landslide.<eos> Clever as well as charismatic.<eos> The idea is, there are certain politicians who have that edge of authority and style, know how to seize the moment as it passes.<eos> You certainly managed that.<eos> - Just luck, I guess.<eos> - It was more than that.<eos> Good contacts, for one thing.<eos> Who tipped you off about the health service?
- No, no. Your directions were fine.<eos> Came out over Highway 2, near Lewis Fork.<eos> Stopped at a place called the Lamplighter Inn.<eos> Had a slice of cherry pie.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Well, I'll tell you, we're sure glad to have the FBI here.<eos> Kind of lucky, in a way, that Ronette stepped out across the state line.<eos> Whole town's really badly shaken up.<eos> Sure, nice, quiet place, something like this.<eos> Sheriff, let me stop you in the hallway here for just a second.
1 0 million kilometres.<eos> Sir, the ship will not withstand the magnetic fields and radiation.<eos> - We will not survive.<eos> - Take us in, Mr. Crusher.<eos> Belay that order.<eos> You're relieved of duty, Commander.<eos> Mr. Worf, confine Mr. Riker to his quarters.<eos> - Worf, that was an order.<eos> - Maintain your position, Lieutenant.<eos> You're destroying yourself and anyone foolish enough to listen to you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> You did what you had to do?<eos> What kind of an answer is that?<eos> The only one I can give you.<eos> You were not functioning properly.<eos> Lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him so completely human.<eos> I wouldn't exactly have used the word "envious".<eos> You disassembled me.<eos> You took me apart!<eos> Lore said the colonists asked you to replace him with a less perfect android.
What?<eos> I noticed you arguing with that Ferengi.<eos> For a moment, it looked like it would come to blows.<eos> You're the woman he mentioned.<eos> I hope your disagreement wasn't over me.<eos> For that information, you'll have to ask him.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To find privacy.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What did he tell you?
Warning.<eos> Lethal radiation exposure in ten seconds.<eos> We have cleared the asteroids, sir.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Cold.<eos> When the sun went down, the temperature really dropped.<eos> This should help.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm not much good to you, Wesley.
Each of us, myself included, wanted to see something of Tasha in this woman.<eos> We saw more than was there.<eos> - You haven't said one word to me.<eos> - What do you wish to talk about?<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> I'm sorry if I hurt you in the process.<eos> I am an android.<eos> It is not possible for me to be injured in that fashion.<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> You know, I wasn't always lying to you.
I beamed this man onboard?<eos> Yes. I was here to meet him.<eos> An elderly man, not in the best of health.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I remember you being here for a short while but you were alone.<eos> Wa-Was he invisible?<eos> Did I carry on a conversation with thin air?<eos> No, Doctor.<eos> As I recall, you came in and you looked around for a few moments.<eos> I asked you if I could help you with anything.
With the photon torpedoes, they might work.<eos> I'm sure Capt Picard would have something inspirational to say now.<eos> I wish he was here cos I'd like to hear it, too.<eos> I know how difficult this transition has been for all of you.<eos> I can take over, but I could never replace Capt Picard.<eos> Whatever the outcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify his faith in all of us.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> What would you do?<eos> Come.<eos> - May I speak to you?
You have to let go of Picard.<eos> Maybe you haven't heard.<eos> I tried to kill him yesterday!<eos> You tried to kill whatever that is on the Borg ship.<eos> Not Picard.<eos> Picard is still here with us in this room.<eos> If he had died, it would be easier.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> They took him from us a piece at a time.<eos> Did he ever tell you why we're so close?
Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she has named John Doe continues at a remarkable pace.<eos> Are you experiencing any discomfort?<eos> None. I can feel the life returning to my body.<eos> Your neurofibrowaves are functioning almost normally again.<eos> That puts you about six weeks ahead of my original schedule.<eos> That should give you and your colleagues something to talk about.<eos> You are all we've talked about since your arrival.<eos> I believe I'm ready for the next phase of my treatment.<eos> You are right. It is about time you stopped taking up valuable bed space.<eos> Now, these motor-assist bands will provide you with electrical stimulation for your arms and legs.
Yes.<eos> So, I ask you again, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Unacceptable. You had a reason.<eos> I want to know what it was.<eos> Damn it, you nearly killed a member of my crew.<eos> And healed him. I'm not forgetting that. That's the reason he's here and not in the brig.<eos> I warned him. Told him it was dangerous.<eos> Why? Why was it dangerous?<eos> What is happening to you?
Long, dirty, disgusting hair.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Forever.<eos> So is everything I loved.<eos> Sarah.<eos> I think it might help to tell you what happened just before Leland died.<eos> It's hard to realise here and here what has transpired.<eos> Your husband went so far as to drug you to keep his actions secret.<eos> But before he died,<eos> Leland confronted the horror of what he had done to Laura and agonised over the pain he had caused you.
Agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper, it's Andy.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> It's Andy.<eos> It's An...<eos> I hung it up for you.
Can you hear me?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> Agent Cooper.<eos> It's Andy.<eos> It's An...<eos> I hung it up for you.<eos> What's that?<eos> Hung it up for you.
- Tsk tsk.<eos> Gotta go, Jerry.<eos> Mr. Horne, have you heard anything from your daughter?<eos> Not since I spoke to Sheriff Truman yesterday.<eos> She phoned me last night.<eos> - From where?<eos> - She didn't say.<eos> She referenced seeing me in my tuxedo.<eos> Now, I was wearing a tux here at the hotel the night that I was shot.<eos> Well, like I told you, Audrey's gone missing before on a semi-regular basis.
Come on...<eos> You gotta be tough with this thing. You gotta hit it hard.<eos> A machine is like a woman, we always say at the machine shop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, Bobby, are you okay?<eos> Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle a cold drink, please?<eos> A diet soda, please. That would be great.<eos> Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle.<eos> This thing is a death trap.<eos> I told you we have to keep him alive.
Uh, excuse me.<eos> We can talk after dinner.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you too.<eos> That bastard.<eos> First your girlfriend, then mine.<eos> Too bad we can only kill him once.<eos> Hey, what's up, doc?<eos> It's Laura Palmer in case you haven't guessed.<eos> I'm making you another one of these tapes, which, as you already know, I've mailed to you in one of the envelopes you gave me.
Mmm... what shall we do?<eos> Cut it out, stupid.<eos> Yeeha!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Are you one of those pretty girls with a mysterious past?<eos> Wonderful. You've just amazed me by trying to assassinate Consano yourself.<eos> Mind your own business.<eos> Carlos is going to flip out when he finds out we have acquired more tanks.<eos> By the way, about the cost of the supplies...<eos> Yes. I hope you don't mind if I give them to you for free.
I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> Where have you been? You let your beard grow.<eos> A little, for you.<eos> A magazine?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> They need to be cared for. You have the hands of a pianist.<eos> Long time ago, I played the mandoline.<eos> You have slender hands.<eos> - Don't bother me! - Born to dance.<eos> Did I hurt you?
Well, Detective Turner, tell me what you saw.<eos> I saw this man, as a slew, on my best friend, my eyes.<eos> Dawson, I'm tired of this story !<eos> Descend the stairs together with her,<eos> He came after me and put the gun back mia.<eos> While she continued to walk, did not see it.<eos> - I tried to warn her!<eos> - Anybody could come back.<eos> Detective, you see the accused face?<eos> I told you that I was attacked from behind!
People versus Harold Williams.<eos> Indictment number 294721.<eos> This case was dismissed three weeks ago.<eos> Go get 'em, tiger.<eos> Why is this case here?<eos> May I approach the bench, Your Honor?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Assistant District Attorney Kramer.<eos> Mr. Kramer, you are new here.<eos> Let me explain something to you.
Have you anything to say to her?<eos> How do you like this cocktail party?<eos> Hello, Mr. McCoy.<eos> Don't make any statements!<eos> Don't talk to anybody!<eos> I'll meet you at the arraignment.<eos> Quiet!<eos> You people sit down!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Do you know the charges that have been brought against you?
Cash!<eos> If your office has any information bearing on bail status of this case make a formal application.<eos> Meanwhile, I release Mr. McCoy under a bond in the amount of $10,000.<eos> Now get this sideshow out of my court!<eos> Your Honor, your action will irreparably damage not only the people's case...<eos> I have spoken!<eos> ...but the people's cause as well.<eos> It ill-behooves the criminal justice system!<eos> Kindly behoove me no "ill-behooves."<eos> The court directs you to shut up!
One who moves.<eos> One who moves...<eos> I didn't hear it.<eos> Say it again, will you?<eos> - Hit the light!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> God almighty!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What is the matter with you?
- Missionary or the usual?<eos> - The usual.<eos> They get a better view.<eos> If it's like our usual, I don't want to see it!<eos> - How about this, Ma?<eos> A grandkid!<eos> - Put your pants back on!<eos> Wait a second!<eos> We can't try any harder to have a baby, OK?<eos> Our staff will show you how to do this.
I hear myself saying it, and I want to cringe.<eos> But this woman knew things she couldn't have known.<eos> Things Sam only said to me.<eos> OK, according to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time?<eos> Huh?<eos> Hell, I'm never going to get undressed again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got more important things to do.<eos> The guy's name is Willy Lopez.<eos> All I'm asking you to do is check it out.
- You hear me?<eos> - I'll take them back.<eos> HENRY:<eos> My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.<eos> Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery... I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.<eos> [TIRES SCREECHING]<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> HENRY:<eos> When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.<eos> Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
- What if he won't talk to me?<eos> - At least you'll know.<eos> Then you could stop worrying about it.<eos> You won't have to be afraid anymore.<eos> No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to Dad.<eos> Especially around the holidays.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just give it a shot.<eos> For your granddaughter anyway.<eos> I'm sure she misses you.
No, no, no, wait.<eos> Hold on. No, wait. Don't hang up.<eos> Jake, don't call back anymore, ok?<eos> Wait! I can't do this by myself.<eos> Frank?<eos> Frank?<eos> We'll get them this afternoon.<eos> Geary. Mr. Geary.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who's been talking to you, huh? The Army?
You can depend on at least four or five months of perfect health.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't feel good now.<eos> That's the ironic part. Mr. Banks, you're a hypochondriac.<eos> Nothing is wrong that has anything to do with your symptoms.<eos> I think your experiences in the fire department were traumatic.<eos> You experienced the imminent possibility of death several times.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You survived.<eos> The cumulative anxiety of those brushes with death left you habitually fearful about your physical person.
I'm begging you!<eos> I don't have anybody else besides you!<eos> What does it have to do with me!<eos> I'm going!<eos> I have to go!<eos> You understand?<eos> I have work to do in the city!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> What's with you and the dump train?
I understand fully.<eos> Now, you understand.<eos> I am still Captain of this vessel and you are still crew and sworn to obey me. You gave me your oath.<eos> Yes, sir, I did.<eos> Then fulfill that oath and serve this ship as you swore to.<eos> Tell me the surest method of attack against the Enterprise.<eos> I won't.<eos> You must.<eos> It is a matter of honor and loyalty to your oath.<eos> I will not surrender the secrets of the Enterprise to you.
You're supposed to be infallible.<eos> Obviously, I am not.<eos> Ensign, where is Cmdr Data?<eos> He has temporarily removed himself from bridge duty, sir.<eos> Your crew is excellently trained.<eos> A tribute to your leadership.<eos> Although I doubt their extensive preparation will be needed.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I do not expect Capt Riker will present much of a challenge.<eos> Mr Kolrami, may I speak with you in private?
Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academy credit for your work here.<eos> I don't think you have anything to worry about.<eos> Those Academy cadets can be extremely competitive.<eos> But you have the practical experience, Wes.<eos> Commander Riker is correct.<eos> While the information imparted to cadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleet officers it, nonetheless, requires a significant period of supplementary systems training and situational disciplines.<eos> Didn't I just say that?<eos> Yes, sir but not quite as perspicuously.<eos> I will not have you telling me what course to set.<eos> As Chief Medical Officer, I am ordering you to report to Starbase 515 immediately.
I didn't come here to give you weapons.<eos> You will make more.<eos> Commander, a photon torpedo may penetrate their shield.<eos> Any hostile move on our part could jeopardize Geordi.<eos> Agreed, but what do the Pakleds want?<eos> Counselor?<eos> They have what they want, for now.<eos> We're approaching Starbase 515, sir.<eos> At last.<eos> Did you read that book I gave you?
Then we can repel the infection.<eos> - Assuming we're not too late.<eos> - How much time do we have?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> His vital signs are getting weaker.<eos> I can't risk another dose of tricordrazine unless I have to.<eos> I must refocus the pattern again.<eos> We need to isolate memories that generate stronger negative emotions.<eos> I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle.<eos> So, I ask you again, Cmdr Riker, where are your loyalties?
The rendezvous will be tricky, so you must reach the intercept point on schedule.<eos> Understood.<eos> And the mission?<eos> The envoy will fill you in.<eos> You are to cooperate fully.<eos> - Can you give me any details?<eos> - Negative.<eos> It's rather difficult to prepare for a mission I know nothing about.<eos> I sympathise, but Starf.leet Command considers this a top-security matter.<eos> Once the envoy has briefed you, you should understand our caution.
The cultural database said the Klingon's family must attend.<eos> So?<eos> We're his family. We'll go.<eos> I just wonder what kind of party the Klingons have.<eos> - Have you got a minute?<eos> I wanted to apologise.<eos> Your personal life is none of my business.<eos> - Even if it involves your father?<eos> - Even if it involves my father.<eos> Did he ever tell you why he never remarried?
Botanists from the aquatic city New Martim Vaz, in Earth's Atlantic.<eos> Residents of Rana IV for five years.<eos> You, madam, are 82 and a composer of Tao classical music.<eos> You, sir, are 85, a specialist in symbiotic plant life.<eos> You have been married 53 years.<eos> I memorized the colony register on the way in the event that information was needed.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> With your permission, I'd like to look inside.<eos> Why?<eos> What could interest you in there?
That dwelling, where you served tea, where you danced waltzes is a reproduction.<eos> Real to the touch, but capable of being created, destroyed and created.<eos> - All on a whim.<eos> - You're joking with us.<eos> - Can't you see this hurts him?<eos> - Rishon.<eos> Hear what he has to say.<eos> More than anything, you wanted the Enterprise away from Rana because the house, the plot of land, your very existence, were incongruities that you were not prepared to explain.<eos> The warship, another recreation, tried to chase us away twice. And failed.<eos> But when I came the second time, I provided you with the only condition that would make the Enterprise leave.
I'm afraid it's bad news.<eos> How can that be?<eos> The risk to the ship and crew is too great.<eos> Until we absolutely know the cause of the disease the children...<eos> The children are harmless.<eos> Every test on them has been negative.<eos> I demand that you do something to save them.<eos> Please, Doctor.<eos> For God's sake, we haven't got much time.<eos> Stand by. I'll get back to you.
Just a moment of forgetfullness and the harm was done<eos> I know Michal will love you like a daughter and you'll be comfortable with him<eos> I'm thinking about you now... wondering what you look like when you're reading this letter<eos> You have dark hair, haven't you?<eos> And slender hands and neck...<eos> I would so much like to<eos> Mother<eos> Good afternoon. Is Jarek home?<eos> No, he's out but he'll be back.<eos> did he tell you he wanted to marry me?
Alfred's great.<eos> I couldn't find my socks without him.<eos> He reminds me of my grandfather.<eos> Were you close to him?<eos> I used to spend summers with him and my grandmother.<eos> They had a house on the lake. Nothing like this, but it was fun.<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> What about your family?<eos> Actually, Alfred is my family.<eos> This house and all this stuff doesn't seem like you at all.
- You know.<eos> Fetching her cigarettes.<eos> - Where's my wife?<eos> - Your wife is your affair.<eos> This is not a lost property office.<eos> I want my wife! Where is she?<eos> You!<eos> You stupid little rat.<eos> Where's my wife? Where is she?<eos> If you have finished, I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.
I'll just...<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> Please come in.<eos> We read about it in the paper.<eos> It's a terrible thing.<eos> She'd been coming here for years.<eos> - Please sit down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Just a couple of questions, Doctor.<eos> The record shows that she phoned you here and at your home a number of times.
A barbaric yawp.<eos> - Yawp. - Come on, louder.<eos> - Oh, that's a mouse. - Come on, louder.<eos> - Yawp.<eos> - God, boy, yell like a man.<eos> - Yawp! There it is.<eos> You see, you have a barbarian in you after all.<eos> Now, you don't get away that easy.<eos> There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there.<eos> What does he remind you of?
What do you say if it's a boy we name it after the Captain?<eos> Philip Laidlaw McBride.<eos> I like that.<eos> Well...<eos> Sorry to piss on your picnic, but Norris wants you on deck.<eos> DSRV-2 is prepped and ready to go.<eos> Pack your gear and tell the others to stand by for decompression.<eos> - What about the missile sled? - I don't plan to do anything.<eos> I just got the retraction order, the Navy can send a recovery team.<eos> All I'm asking you is to secure the missile sled.
Maybe not those in the Border States, but he's gonna free some.<eos> - My God!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Says he would've done it sooner but he needed a big victory.<eos> I guess that's what this is.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Please don't cut anymore!<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> Am I hurting you, captain?
The Nazis?<eos> Is that the limit of your vision?<eos> The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend, take on the world.<eos> They're welcome.<eos> But I want the Grail itself.<eos> The cup that gives everlasting life.<eos> Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him.<eos> I'll be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the dodo.<eos> The Grail is mine. And you're going to get it for me.<eos> Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I want five inmates.<eos> Give me a bat.<eos> I want to break up this car.<eos> Hold him right there!<eos> I want you to watch this, Leone.<eos> To the honeymoon suite!<eos> Good night.<eos> - You should have been notified.<eos> - Why is he in isolation?<eos> I can't tell you.
I'm sorry, sir, but could you wait just a minute?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - I could bring it down to her.<eos> The woman with the baby carriage, right?<eos> That'd be a big help.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> Let's go, Jiji.<eos> Wow!<eos> Sorry to startle you, but you left this pacifier in the bakery.
Let's go!<eos> We're coming!<eos> All set?<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> This is the place.<eos> - What's it say, Mommy?<eos> - It says "pet cemetery", honey.<eos> It's misspelled, but that's what it says.<eos> Ellie, wait a minute!<eos> I told you it's a bad road.
The soil's thin.<eos> But you'll manage.<eos> I'm gonna sit over yonder and have a smoke.<eos> I'd help you but you gotta do it yourself.<eos> Each buries his own.<eos> When you talk to them... Not one word about what we done tonight.<eos> What did we do tonight?<eos> What we did, Louis, was a secret thing.<eos> Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets.<eos> But any woman will tell you she's never seen into a man's heart.
- The howling of the wolves...<eos> - Will you shut up?<eos> The baying of the dogs.<eos> You just have to play that little-girl-lost routine, don't you?<eos> "I'm just a fugitive felon.<eos> "That doesn't mean I'm not feminine.<eos> "I just need a strong man to help me.<eos> "I guess that makes me like a Cosmo fugitive."<eos> Buddy.<eos> Look, I asked you for a favor. You said okay.
Yes, of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> - I'm glad to hear it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You must have overlooked this.<eos> I'm sorry to have disturbed you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Good day.<eos> Hello.<eos> I hope the rain won't prevent you from coming.
It's just...<eos> - Well, I'm really angry at him right now.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, he invited this college friend of his to come stay at our house, and, well, he didn't even ask me.<eos> I'm gonna say yes, of course, but, you know, it just would have been nice to have been asked.<eos> What upset you about that?<eos> I guess it makes me angry because I can't justify being angry.<eos> It's his house.<eos> He pays the mortgage.<eos> Yes, but he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
And watch your back, Picard.<eos> Close friends are few and far between.<eos> Two of the oldest and closest are Jack Crusher, may he rest in peace, and Walker Keel.<eos> Before various missions split us up, we were virtually inseparable.<eos> I trust Keel.<eos> If he had to violate regulations, he must have had a good reason.<eos> But you're putting your career at risk for him.<eos> Friendship must dare to risk, Counsellor, or it's not friendship.<eos> They illicitly used the emergency channel.<eos> Then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors, effectively to disobey Starfleet regulations.
One is tall. The other is shorter, left-handed, and is employed in a laboratory.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> One set of footfalls is widely spaced. The other is evenly spaced, closer together.<eos> Further, on the ground you can see the scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumably to see if he is being followed.<eos> Left-footed means left-handed.<eos> The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity.<eos> Finally, there can be no argument. The game... is afoot.<eos> Come, Watson.<eos> Hear that?<eos> What do those footfalls tell you, Watson?
You asked your computer to program a nefarious fictional character from 19th-century London, which is how I arrived.<eos> But I am no longer that creation, that evil character.<eos> I have changed. I am alive.<eos> And I am aware of my own consciousness.<eos> Moriarty, my responsibility is this vessel and its crew.<eos> I want my existence.<eos> I want it out there, just as you have yours.<eos> That may not be possible.<eos> - Then you must murder me, Captain.<eos> - I cannot give you what you want.
Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus, like it or not.<eos> Why?<eos> You're limping.<eos> A run-in with an aspiring sprinter.<eos> - Number One.<eos> - Problem?<eos> More a curiosity.<eos> We've been tracking faint energy readings to locate its source.<eos> It's like following a trail of breadcrumbs.<eos> The pathfinder led us here and then stopped, which I knew would interest you.
If you refuse, this person will die.<eos> I will not be coerced.<eos> I will do it.<eos> I will kill him.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> You're not a killer.<eos> Help us, please!<eos> I'm not sure that I can.<eos> My insides are still shaking, but I'm alright.<eos> Capt Picard, could I see you a moment?

You'll be hearing about this.<eos> There is trouble tonight in the camp.<eos> I said, trouble in the camp.<eos> The infantrymen have kidnapped a white American soldier.<eos> White, yes, white.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I think American soldiers may have beaten and captured Diatta.<eos> But where is Sergeant Diatta?<eos> He stayed overnight in town.<eos> I told you this morning, Captain.
I hope you face up to your responsibilities.<eos> Gen. Kikuchi is right.<eos> We should return to our home land, and we should take all data with us.<eos> That might be possible, but we must still prepare for the possibility of being captured.<eos> No matter what, we can't allow these secrets to be made known.<eos> How about this?<eos> We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide, if anyone's captured, then they commit suicide.<eos> Well then... that's what we'll do.<eos> I will personal be in charge of the retreat, and arrange the transport.<eos> I'm very happy you made this decision, I'm sure everybody is grateful to you.
Eddie, you gotta be quicker than that.<eos> I've always wanted to work on Wall Street. I read the Journal.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.<eos> I appreciate that, Flanagan, but all our professionals have college degrees.<eos> I catch on pretty quick.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> We're not interested. - A guy like you, advertising.<eos> - l have a feel for advertising.<eos> I can look at an ad and tell you what's wrong with it.
- But couldn't I just call Freddy? - No. Trust me in this matter.<eos> But I think that maybe I love him and that maybe he loves me, I think.<eos> And now that he's cured...<eos> Then it's even more important for you to go away for a couple of weeks.<eos> If a man loves you, he will follow you.<eos> - But how do I know...<eos> - Trust me this one last time.<eos> All right.<eos> But what about your fee?<eos> You do what I tell you, and you can keep the fee.
What's the matter? Why?<eos> My mother gave it to me on her death... bed.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> All right, darling.<eos> I'll get it for you.<eos> You promise?<eos> I'll think of something.<eos> Sex is very, very difficult for me with somebody that I don't trust completely. I promise I'll get it. OK?<eos> I love you, Archie.<eos> I've loved you ever since the first second I saw you!
I don't want this to get out of hand.<eos> I'm sorry for the trouble.<eos> I know it's been a lot of trouble.<eos> All right, doctor, we understand.<eos> By the way the concierge informs me you asked him to translate a tape with messages on it.<eos> He mentioned a name, Dede.<eos> I was told that tape had important medical information relating to the convention.<eos> You wouldn't have that tape with you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, doctor, it may interest you to know that my colleagues have come across a man called Dede Martin who was in serious need of medical attention.
That's a phenomenon that's only been observed in whales and dolphins. Until now.<eos> - Why is he doing this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Shouldn't someone take him a blanket or something?<eos> Coffee?<eos> - I know you.<eos> - We just met, a few minutes ago.<eos> - In the lake?<eos> - No... In the hut.<eos> Then it must have been someone who looked a lot like you.
Because it believes they'll be flying from now on.<eos> From every swing and turn.<eos> Perhaps... it is flying.<eos> Go on, young man, before it's too late.<eos> Believe me, there is nothing worse in a man's life than when he realizes that those he loves,<eos> those he feels are friends... well, when suddenly it turns out that they are on a fatal path and cannot find the proper way again.<eos> Because their sins prevent them from ever becoming honest citizens again, because they have lost the chance for ever to live freely with a clear conscience under the protection of the law, enjoying their days.<eos> So it was this awful inner tension that brought me here setting the affectionate friend in me aside to fulfil my duties, because of my deep respect for order.<eos> Please do not consider my report as a confidential case. But cheap tattling.<eos> And I authorize you, if necessary, to mention my name.
- Having sex!<eos> - Being physical with a woman.<eos> To possess her physically.<eos> Ah!<eos> Now I got it!<eos> I did it with Giuditta.<eos> - Now you are not together?<eos> - Please!<eos> Intimate relationships make you reach inside.<eos> - What is it that your girlfriend left you?
I care about your brother's Life and the treatment he receives.<eos> I made a commitment to your father some 20 years ago... and I'm not willing to gamble with that.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a very big check.<eos> $250,000.<eos> And no strings attached.<eos> Just walk away, Charlie.<eos> This isn't about you and me.<eos> It's not about winning or losing.<eos> I asked you a week ago, why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother? You didn't have an answer.
This is distribution weight. Fucking cop setup. You're fired.<eos> You know who I got on retainer? Cleanheads deal:<eos> The lawyer I got makes ACLU look like Nazis.<eos> He lives for cop misconduct like this.<eos> -Probably sue you for fucking free. -Yeah? And I ain't telling you shit.<eos> Okay, Abdul Elijah's running the deal from Joliet.<eos> Shit's coming in in a couple of days. I don't know where.<eos> I swear on my balls, I don't know where.<eos> Soviet method is more economical.<eos> I'm so glad I took the time to explain to you an individual's rights. Streak. Sorry about that hand.
Of course, God will judge the world.<eos> -Could it be happening now?<eos> -lt could happen any time.<eos> Jesus said the end would come like a thief in the night.<eos> That belief is fundamental to every religion.<eos> Moslem, Christian, Jew, Hindu.<eos> There are differences amongst them as to how it will actually happen but we all believe in a Messiah who delivers God`s wrath upon the world.<eos> Then it could be happening.<eos> The moon has turned to blood.<eos> I told you about the paper and the fish.
How do you know my name?<eos> I followed the signs.<eos> They led me to you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A priest who`s come to help you and your baby.<eos> We don`t have much time.<eos> Please.<eos> I know what you`re going through.<eos> I know what`s going to happen.<eos> I must know everything he`s told you if l`m to help.
A priest who`s come to help you and your baby.<eos> We don`t have much time.<eos> Please.<eos> I know what you`re going through.<eos> I know what`s going to happen.<eos> I must know everything he`s told you if l`m to help.<eos> He said if I can stop a sign, the chain will be broken.<eos> He said that?<eos> Yes, and God would grant the world a second chance.<eos> Did he tell you which sign to stop?
I don't want to punish you.<eos> I'm not saying another word.<eos> I don't care about you.<eos> All I want to know is what happened to her.<eos> I understand, Mr. Hofman.<eos> I've put myself in your shoes.<eos> In fact, I believe that you don't want to punish me.<eos> But I'm not so certain I should.<eos> Understand?<eos> I believe you, but I must pretend that I don't.
- Will you wait for me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Paper, sir?<eos> Did you notice a bloke just come out of there with a blonde?<eos> Do you know where he's gone?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir, it's Brendan, Mr. Finney.<eos> - What do you want, Brendan?<eos> - Could I talk to you for a minute?
- What's that?<eos> - Paint from the rabbit's glove.<eos> Mr. Valiant?<eos> I hope you're proud of yourself and those pictures you took.<eos> Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime?<eos> No, Judge Doom.<eos> Valiant here was just pickin' it up for you. Weren't you, Eddie?<eos> - Hand it over. - Sure.<eos> His number-one seller.<eos> I see working for a Toon has rubbed off on you.
Elora Danan told me.<eos> Elora?<eos> Elora, Willow is here.<eos> - But she's just a baby.<eos> - She's very special.<eos> My Brownies have been searching for her ever since we heard she was born.<eos> Elora Danan has chosen you to be her guardian.<eos> Me?<eos> Yes.<eos> She likes you.
Florence. Nice friend you have.<eos> -He's not my friend, he's my neighbor.<eos> He won't be invited again.<eos> -Have you seen Florence?<eos> Eva, don't be stupid.<eos> Come, let's go home.<eos> That guy was standing too close to you.<eos> That was off.<eos> Shit!<eos> What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.<eos> -Go away, please.<eos> Leave.<eos> -I want to... but I can't open the door.<eos> Boris?<eos> Boris, can I explain what happened?<eos> Hello?<eos> -Hello?<eos> Florence!<eos> -Did your girlfriend tell you... that I called earlier?
I'm very much against that idea.<eos> Lutan is clearly a liar, and devious.<eos> Counsellor Troi believes he is capable of killing.<eos> It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger.<eos> But Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader is an honoured guest.<eos> Not us, not second-in-command.<eos> Him.<eos> And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violate that.<eos> Yes, it seems reasonable, put that way.<eos> But I warn you, if you get hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain.
Only the Q can do that.<eos> Captain's log, star date 4159 1.4.<eos> 12 minutes out from Quadra Sigma Ill, where the survivors of a disaster desperately need us.<eos> On the Enterprise, First Officer William T Riker needs help nearly as badly.<eos> But this is a subject far out of my experience.<eos> Out of any human's experience.<eos> How the hell do I advise you?<eos> You know the implications as well as I.<eos> No one has ever offered to turn me into a god before.<eos> What the Q has offered you has to be close to immortality.

They hurt.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's quite normal for them to feel uncomfortable at first.<eos> These drops will help.<eos> Please get them out of my eyes.<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> They're cutting into my eyes!<eos> Take them out!<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> I told you to take these things out of my eye!
I was hoping I could talk with your mother.<eos> You're a little late.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> No, I never met her but I was hoping she could answer some questions for me.<eos> Are you a cop?<eos> No, my name is Harry Angel.<eos> I'm a private detective.<eos> So what's...?<eos> - Epiphany.<eos> Your mama left you with a very beautiful name.
Margaret Krusemark's old man wants you on the first train home.<eos> Take that fucking thing away from me!<eos> Don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> A dog bit me.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Right now, I need a laundry.<eos> Listen, Epiphiny...<eos> - Epiphany.<eos> There's something I want to ask you.
- Where are you?<eos> Don't ask questions, just listen.<eos> One Momma's running for cover, and I'm going with her.<eos> About your car, I paid a guy $100 to drive it back to DC.<eos> He's going to leave it at the Watergate parking lot.<eos> I'll call you again, Wednesday, 897-12.<eos> Wait a second, are you trying to melt that iceberg?<eos> Charlie, consider who she is.<eos> Mister.<eos> Mister, did anyone ever tell you... that your wife looks sort of like the President's wife?
I wanted to see if you're as frightened of eating those figs as I am.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Come on, are you scared to eat those figs? Are you?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Are you frightened to eat those figs?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Why should I be frightened?<eos> I think you ought to see a doctor.<eos> Monday, May 20.<eos> Monsieur Boullée... I hope you don't mind me writing to you like this.
A fine building.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Is your wife Italian?<eos> Her parents were Italian, yes.<eos> From Umbria.<eos> A fine fig-growing area.<eos> Do you sleep well at night?<eos> I did before I got to Rome.<eos> Mr. Architect, I can assure you that you are not being poisoned.
You have now made it plain... that what is good for the goose, is good for the philanderer.<eos> An English proverb?<eos> Philanderer?<eos> That's very funny coming from you.<eos> Your wife is very beautiful, Signor Kracklite... especially when she is pregnant.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> She is pregnant.<eos> But not with your child, Speckler.<eos> True.<eos> I'm very grateful to you for that.
Here.<eos> I hate it when my eyes get all puffy.<eos> I get all stuffed up. I look terrible.<eos> Are my eyes puffy?<eos> Can we stop so I can blow my nose and wash my face?<eos> I gotta go to the bathroom.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can I help you?
I've been in Europe for three months.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> - What did I do?<eos> Why did you stop me?<eos> - Well, well, well...<eos> - You're under arrest.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Murder.<eos> - Who am I supposed to have killed?<eos> A homicide detective downtown will explain that to you.
I've got 1st amendment rights, too.<eos> Look 'em up.<eos> I don't have. I can quote 'em to you.<eos> Anyhow, how much do you figure a monthly run of your...<eos> "magazine" is worth?<eos> It's more money than you'll ever see in your life. And I do that every month.<eos> My money's clean.<eos> I'll tell you what you do before you go home and start polishing your pennies.<eos> Go out and get my magazines back on the stand where they belong.<eos> Listen, hotshot, I don't care for you or the putrid sludge you're trowelling out. But until the laws are changed, my job's to get back your boxes of smut.
early one morning you leave the protected walls of our city.<eos> Your courage has brought you this far, Dr. Mesmer.<eos> The world lies open.<eos> But the closer you get to the infected areas, it seems as if the elements turn against you.<eos> It may start with a light cough, but quickly, and without mercy, the respiratory organs are disabled by the infected air.<eos> The bacteria in the soil penetrate the skin and the flesh by mere contact.<eos> And the water you drink will destroy you from inside.<eos> Let me make you an offer, Dr. Mesmer.<eos> As you probably know, I am chairman of the crisis commission, which was established in the early days of the epidemic as advisories to the government.<eos> confidentially, I can tell you that the government has just decided to resign.
- I know. I was afraid.<eos> - But there's no danger now.<eos> - Why not? Because the men have all gone to war.<eos> Are you afraid of men?<eos> - All women are afraid.<eos> - Why? Because...<eos> Because of...<eos> Catch! A gift for you.<eos> So then... I've heard nice things about you.<eos> - Who told you?
Get as many as you can.<eos> All you got to do is just not miss.<eos> I won't miss.<eos> We're going to get bloody on this one.<eos> Are you really crazy?<eos> Or are you as good as you say you are?<eos> You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We don 't want your daughter.<eos> We want to know what Hunsaker told you.
She refused to answer. How could I know if she knew the answers?<eos> Let me ask the questions. I'm the attorney.<eos> She could have known the answers?<eos> She could have known the answers.<eos> Now, doctor, you say she didn't answer you. What did she do?<eos> She laughed.<eos> What else did she do?<eos> She never stopped taking notes.<eos> She was belligerent in her attitude. She wouldn't answer me.<eos> You're really not used to patients who don't answer you.
What?<eos> You have to let me discredit the witness.<eos> Maybe you are crazy.<eos> I have no more questions, your honor.<eos> Mrs. Kirk, you may step down.<eos> I'd like to call Arthur kirk.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this special proceeding shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> How old was the defendant when you married her mother?<eos> Claudia was 5. Was there anything that would have led you to believe that Claudia was troubled?
My next group of questions will show, your honor.<eos> Proceed.<eos> So you lived off the $10,000 you got from your husband?<eos> No, I spent that on furniture and kitchen stuff.<eos> What did you live on?<eos> Gifts. Gifts.<eos> Gifts from whom?<eos> Friends.<eos> Men friends?<eos> What did these friends give you... jewelry?
And your clothes make me want to puke.<eos> I'll tell you that right now.<eos> -Capt. Harris!<eos> -Well, well, Mahoney.<eos> -It's been a long time, sir.<eos> -So it has.<eos> Well, Motormouth Jones.<eos> Anyone ever tell you you've got a great tailor, sir?<eos> I mentioned that just last week.<eos> Has anyone told you, Mahoney, that you're still a little pissant?
Here...<eos> The backup ops panels, plus shield and armoury controls.<eos> The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position.<eos> High-resolution, multi-spectro sensors.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Perimeter alert!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Get off the bridge! Both of you!<eos> - You have a perimeter alert.<eos> - As my son tried to tell you.
I'm Kathleen Riley, with the Public Defenders' Office.<eos> I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> You're being charged with murder.<eos> Could you tell me where you were around midnight, December 18th?<eos> Where were you at midnight, December 18th?<eos> I'm your lawyer.<eos> Anything you tell me is confidential.<eos> If you don't talk to me, I can't help you.<eos> I guess this is a waste of time.<eos> Do you understand what's happening to you?
They get married, they have children.<eos> They take responsibility.<eos> They don't sleep in other people's cars or steal nine dollars from anyone!<eos> Did you kill Elizabeth Rose Quinn?<eos> Your witness.<eos> That was a wonderful performance.<eos> The man shouldn't be on trial, he should be given a medal.<eos> You were discharged from the army for psychiatric reasons?<eos> "Yes. "<eos> Did you beat an officer with a shovel because he asked you to dig a trench?
Hush up.<eos> Tell me who's inside.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Is it a man? A woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll get the other key.<eos> Time is running short.<eos> You must decide.<eos> It's up to you to give me the job.<eos> After what I've told you, you should take me.
Hey, Mr. Rooney, how you doing?<eos> Listen, I'm sorry to disturb you at work, but I'm not feeling very well today and I was wondering if it might be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I might need.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Mr. Peterson?<eos> I think I owe you an apology, sir.<eos> -Well, I should say you do.<eos> -l... I, I, I...<eos> Well, I think you should be sorry, for Christ's sake.<eos> A family member dies and you insult me.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you anyway?
I was looking forward to your arrival.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Well, this is our planet.<eos> Australia 458.<eos> And you?<eos> After all, you would be sorry to arrive and not to find a soul, wouldn't you?<eos> Here you are.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Well?<eos> That's a nice chippy I've found for you.
I know nothing.<eos> I am not authorized.<eos> Ask the manager.<eos> He is in charge.<eos> Once you're going, give this to Al.<eos> Tell him I've found it under the couch.<eos> I read in newspapers that if you get it in time, you can stitch it back.<eos> I am looking for a girl, a very young blonde.<eos> No hard feelings, please.<eos> The hot-dogs which I recommended to you last night were quite fresh.
- Yeah, you'd love it.<eos> It's really entertaining.<eos> I know you'd have a good time.<eos> And don't forget the poem on page 112.<eos> - It reminded me of you. - Really?<eos> Page 112.<eos> Your slightest look easily will unclose me though I have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens touching skillfully, mysteriously, her first rose...<eos> I do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses.<eos> Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.<eos> I wasn't too happy with the results of your ENG or your BSER, either, which is why I sent you to Tomography, where you saw that stuff rolling around.
She's in the mountains with her husband<eos> She left the maid<eos> Adriana!<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you think we can corner him?<eos> I think so<eos> The fireplace is lit<eos> Here I am<eos> Put the things on the trays and the bottle in the refrigerator<eos> What did madam tell you?
- Just one dance.<eos> Now, I have to go to the jack.<eos> So you wait for me. The "john."<eos> Oh, ya, you're doing real good.<eos> - Just keep working on those last two bars. - Let us go!<eos> Coming through, please.<eos> Wine coolers. Perier, Long Island ice tea.<eos> Please take a drink.<eos> ...he's putting on a tie.<eos> He's going to tell you about these peace time uses.
Of course I'm happy.<eos> I'm happy because I don't set myself unattainable and unachievable tasks.<eos> I always set myself immediate and feasible tasks and I'm happy fulfilling them.<eos> As you may know, I had certain lack of success in my official work And I won't deny that it painfully hurt my self-esteem.<eos> But I've got my way.<eos> I received my present position precisely in the town I wanted.<eos> It's good for my family as well as for the education of the children.<eos> And though my earnings are not sufficient to serve our needs, I believe they will raise.<eos> I believe I'm of benefit to my place.<eos> Without false modesty I will tell you that this place might have been taken by a man of far lower professional and moral capacity.
But if you fail you don't get diddly.<eos> This is the million dollars.<eos> Oh! Jeez!<eos> I never seen that much money in my life.<eos> We've investigated your background, Mr. Brewster.<eos> The highest salary you've ever had is $11,000 for one season with the Toledo Mud Hens.<eos> You've never even had a credit card in your entire life.<eos> Think of spending a million dollars a day for 30 days with no assets to show for it.<eos> It's quite difficult to spend money without accumulating assets, even if the money is spent foolishly.<eos> Surely no one could blame you for refusing such an eccentric gamble?
To them, we're ashamed of everything.<eos> If I could think of anything I'd be ashamed of, I'd have tried it.<eos> Look, Zach...<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> - How many jobs are there? - Four and four.<eos> 44?<eos> - Four boys, four girls.<eos> - Any women?<eos> Dick, I'm going to need a spotlight.<eos> Zach said he'll call you as soon as he can.
Must have cost you hundreds.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I oughta frame mine.<eos> Will the Pope be in later?<eos> Here's my proposition.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> I want you to murder me.<eos> Here, on Thursday.<eos> I'd like you to shoot me dead.<eos> And the reason I ask you to do me this service is because I'm already facing a very long, painful and most certain death.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business.<eos> Alan is the most loving husband a girl could have.<eos> He dotes on that bride of his.<eos> His wife.<eos> You've met her?<eos> Well, of course we have.<eos> He brings her with him.<eos> Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh to you?<eos> Has he?<eos> Boy, what in the hell's the matter with you?
Hasi was "somebody's" cousin. Um... he was gonna give me $25,000.<eos> So I went to Zurich. I went to a vault.<eos> Everything went fine.<eos> He met me at the airport.<eos> - Who killed Hasi?<eos> - They wanted the stones.<eos> If I lose the stones, I'm dead for sure.<eos> The police can't help me.<eos> I'm one of the bad guys.<eos> Who were those men chasing you at the airport?
I don't play games with my clients.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Tell me about Virginia Howell.<eos> She's a real bitch.<eos> She says your wife told her she was going to divorce you.<eos> - We can blow her out of the water.<eos> - How? - Coffee?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you come back, I want to know exactly how.<eos> When I come back, I'll tell you exactly how.
He was my...<eos> He was my lover.<eos> You had an affair with him for six months two years ago?<eos> Answer the question, please.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> You were in love with him?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> And he was in love with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did Mr. Forrester ever speak to you about divorcing his wife?
You may proceed.<eos> Did she ever speak to you about her relationship with her husband?<eos> - She said he didn't care what she did.<eos> - Move to strike, your Honour.<eos> Motion denied.<eos> Please continue.<eos> She said she knew he was seeing someone, too.<eos> Whoever he was seeing Page said he'd take her riding all the time.<eos> She said those horses of his were foreplay.<eos> Did Mrs. Forrester ever talk to you about divorcing her husband?
- Now let me show you my humble house. - Thank you.<eos> I'm really blessed. My people love me.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> They seem very... enthusiastic.<eos> Oh, this is a good shot for you - the little boy holding up my picture.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.<eos> My humble house.<eos> You must forgive us.<eos> We are a poor people.<eos> Everything you need, they will bring you.
What is your rank?<eos> What do you want to talk to me about?<eos> Nothing, you can go now.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Did they ask...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ka-kui.<eos> Your tape recorder.<eos> OK.<eos> What did they say to you?
This is your jacket.<eos> I told you to put it on.<eos> Yes.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Use my car.<eos> Which one is yours?<eos> Over there.<eos> Why are you not nervous at all?<eos> I'm used to situations like this.<eos> I told you to stay quiet, didn't I?
Exactly?<eos> Two minutes and half.<eos> So at most eight or night buses could have passed by.<eos> But you said there was one.<eos> I say you're lying.<eos> Don't you know the buses are always late?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's give you the benefit of the doubt.<eos> Assume there was one bus and you could see it all the time.<eos> Which part was clearly visible to you?
Speak louder.<eos> I could have jumped off, he couldn't.<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> I mean it!<eos> You try jumping from a moving bus!<eos> Control yourself!<eos> If that's not him why did he bribe me?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He offered me money to let him go.<eos> If it was you and someone pointed a gun at you, what would you do?
It certainly can't be a Jew.<eos> The Dreyfus affair enraged all of Europe.<eos> We'd stir up an international storm of indignation... and upset the Emperor's important links... with the Rothschild bank.<eos> And finally... no Serb or Croat. That zone is too hot and must be tackled otherwise.<eos> You have Hungarian blood in you?<eos> That's what we need, a Ukrainian.<eos> Look for a duplicate of yourself, Redl. I'd have to search Galicia.<eos> Then look there.<eos> Similar background, career and connections.<eos> That can't be a problem for you.
I'm sure that engineer Worowka... and army supplier Victor Ullman... conspired to pass plans of the Przemysl fortress... to Petersburg.<eos> Have you arrested them? No.<eos> Ullman committed suicide... and Worowka was murdered in Vienna.<eos> Once you go into action, death follows. Przemysl.<eos> What do you want to know from Kubinyi?<eos> If Ullman had any military diplomatic contacts.<eos> Tell me, Redl... are you a cruel man?<eos> Imperial Highness, I am doing my duty.<eos> - What faith?<eos> - As I told you, I'm Catholic.
-You from hereabouts?<eos> -Nope.<eos> Just passing through?<eos> I hadn't thought about it.<eos> After what you did, I wouldn't stay in town.<eos> My cabin has two rooms. You're welcome to one.<eos> I wouldn't want to be a burden on you or your family.<eos> All I got is a kind of fiancée.<eos> It would be a pleasure, not a burden.<eos> Three hots and a cot is the least I owe you.
You probably never even heard of the Great War.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I missed it. - Yeah.<eos> People get old, and sick, and never find true love.<eos> Where I come from, people don't disappoint.<eos> They're consistent.<eos> - They're always reliable.<eos> - You don't find that kind in real life.<eos> You have.<eos> Is it true they're talking to you about the life of Lindbergh?
You may scream.<eos> There is no shame.<eos> You are strong!<eos> Very strong!<eos> The strongest so far.<eos> But you're nearly dead.<eos> Poor waif.<eos> Make the radio call.<eos> To talk, to obey would be so much easier.<eos> Yushin has a memento for you of this day.
You are strong!<eos> Very strong!<eos> The strongest so far.<eos> But you're nearly dead.<eos> Poor waif.<eos> Make the radio call.<eos> To talk, to obey would be so much easier.<eos> Yushin has a memento for you of this day.<eos> Put it in his eye.<eos> If your own life means nothing to you, perhaps his does.
It was a nice ride.<eos> Sure you'll find a place?<eos> Sure. I'll be okay.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Bread for some bread?<eos> You can't leave her there.<eos> The woods aren't safe.<eos> Jean-Pierre, help me.<eos> Go find her.<eos> It was in the woods. I'll show you on the map.
Are handcuffs a thing with you or what?<eos> I'll free you, honey, when I get my papers back.<eos> Honey? Are we on intimate terms now?<eos> Did you buy my story about the accident?<eos> No.<eos> Are you the manager?<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm a friend of Fred's.<eos> Fred?<eos> You know, the guy who left his tuxedo with you.
What's up?<eos> Looks bad?<eos> If you love Jesus, blow your horn.<eos> Now real slow give me your eyes.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> - Who do you work for?<eos> - I'm on Clay's team, under Taber.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Clay told you to buy a deck of cards and go back to your hotel, right?
Your input would be strictly confidential.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forget it.<eos> What is it you want to talk about?<eos> One-way ticket to San Francisco, Mr. Cody.<eos> And how would you like to pay for that?<eos> -ln cash.<eos> -That will be $45 one-way.<eos> Federal agent.<eos> Excuse me. Now, ma'am, I'd like to see the bills that man just handed you, please.
Under an exclusive marketing agreement with me.<eos> These are outrageous terms!<eos> Perhaps a demonstration would convince you.<eos> - I want no part of it, thank you.<eos> - As you wish.<eos> The rest of our discussion must of course be confidential.<eos> - Would you wait outside?<eos> - If you'd like me to, yes.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> May Day will provide you with a drink.
Yes. And it'll be flooding any moment.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two, that way.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> It's time to flood the fault.<eos> But...<eos> May Day. And my men.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A convenient coincidence.<eos> Mr Zorin, those men are loyal to you.
A man in Bangkok is saying something about...<eos> I'm not quite sure about what.<eos> I want to talk to him in person.<eos> But he's very angry about a group from Toronto that calls itself the Nam Soong.<eos> Sister, you gotta be more precise.<eos> That's going to be very difficult, Captain.<eos> It's been many years since we've heard the Hakka dialect spoken.<eos> They're talking aroundthings, not about them.<eos> Damn it, Sister, that's the point!<eos> They're not gonna spell it out for you.
And if I get a certain job, my authority will count in many circles.<eos> So I advise you to accept.<eos> It's lovely here.<eos> It reminds me of when I was a boy back home.<eos> You were already a legend.<eos> You know what they called you?<eos> What?<eos> - "The Man of Rome".<eos> - Me, "The Man of Rome"?<eos> I remember many people asked you for favours and you were kind to all.
You know how sensitive they can be.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Good evening.<eos> See you in Rome on Saturday.<eos> See how good I am? I've brought him to Palermo.<eos> Santamaria beats his own drum.<eos> He's vain, but harmless.<eos> Now leave us alone, please.<eos> Inspector...<eos> I've been wanting to tell you I'm a fan of yours.
What's wrong, Altero?<eos> There's something else I must tell you.<eos> It's about...<eos> I've been told...<eos> Well, some people are saying that a person made a scene in a restaurant... There was an argument and they say it was you.<eos> - Which restaurant?<eos> - ll Caminetto.<eos> - Don't know it.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> The person must have looked like you.
A Simon you know nothing of.<eos> The Simon that you loved, is a complete stranger to me.<eos> Unique love doesn't exist.<eos> I've loved other men... I love Jerome.<eos> Maybe tomorrow I'll leave him...<eos> By dying with Simon, with Simon's love, you may be killing a new love.<eos> I'll die for the Simon I loved.<eos> Then why did you want to see me?<eos> I hoped for a sign...<eos> Simon asked nothing of you.
The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you. But if you return to Beverly Hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.<eos> - Sir, may I say something?<eos> - What?<eos> He seems to have enough...<eos> You want to tell that to the chief?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Then I suggest you get moving.<eos> Come on, Axel.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you.
Those people are mine.<eos> I've been after them for days.<eos> The booty's yours, then.<eos> That includes the camels and riffles... and those people who need to go home.<eos> I don't give a shit about those niggers.<eos> - I'm afraid I'm on a mission.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> You won't enter my district!<eos> Only I have the authority to negotiate with the Nemas.<eos> Again, I'm asking you to take those people home.
- Yes, have some.<eos> Vinz, what sign are you waiting for? .<eos> Gozer the Traveller will come in a pre-chosen form.<eos> During the rectification of the Vuldronaii, he came as a Torb.<eos> During the reconciliation of the Meketrex, he came as a giant Sloar!<eos> Many Shubs and Zuuls were roasted in the Sloar that day!<eos> - Egon.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> There's something strange about that man.<eos> I have a terrible feeling that something awful will happen to you.
I have a parakeet.<eos> A parakeet is a wonderful pet for a man. No thank you.<eos> Now, you ask, I do have the one billy goat, which you can see he's a very handsome fellow.<eos> Then i've got the nanny goat,<eos> You like goat cheese, perfect opportunity.<eos> Then i've got these two ducks.<eos> - Sweet.<eos> And i've got the mallard over there.<eos> - He's a handsome rooster.<eos> The rooster- wake you up every morning, keep you company.
Come back Mc-soon.<eos> "I am now driving a taxi part-time. "<eos> Sunday I got a date with Lucia.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew there was something going on between you and her.<eos> No, nothing going on.<eos> I'm still virgin in New York City.<eos> There ain't no crime in sex.<eos> You're too shy.<eos> -She digs you, man.
Stands have been constantly filled.<eos> Financial fortunes have been radically reversed since you joined.<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> You're not fascinated by the almighty dollar?<eos> I never gave it much thought.<eos> You're above such mundane thoughts, huh?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> No, I'm as interested in a buck as anybody else.<eos> And I am not one to let good deeds go unrewarded.<eos> Would a new contract interest you?
The lining of your stomach has been gradually deteriorating due to a previous injury.<eos> We pumped your stomach and came up with this.<eos> This silver bullet head has been in your stomach for some time.<eos> Years, I would say.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's history.<eos> Yes, but it could prove fatal if you continue to play baseball.<eos> Stop now, and in time it could heal properly.<eos> Can I play Monday?<eos> The odds and your age would be against you.
Won't you come right in here?<eos> Why don't you take a seat right over there?<eos> Mr. Denby... I was wondering if you would... show me how to fill out a check?<eos> I never did it before, and I'd best learn how.<eos> Certainly, Mrs. Spalding.<eos> It's just the simplest thing in the world.<eos> Now up here, this is where you put the date.<eos> Mr. Denby... I'm thinking it won't be necessary for me to sell my farm after all.<eos> Of course it's necessary.<eos> I explained all that to you yesterday.
Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...<eos> Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed at .03 cent a pound.<eos> That comes to... $13.50.<eos> - $13.50?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.<eos> - Miz Spalding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That ain't the seed you're paying for.<eos> He's charging you for grade-A seed, but that's gin-run quality.
Go on and have a seat.<eos> I ought to explain to you how things work around here.<eos> I gin the cotton for a fee, then I buy your cotton if we agree on a price.<eos> For ginning, it's customary to charge $5 on the ton.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I was told that you sometimes gin the cotton for the seed.<eos> Yes, that's another way of working it.<eos> I gin the cotton and keep the seed.<eos> The way it was explained to me, you're supposed to keep... a third.<eos> I'll tell you right now, I won't pay that.
You got rush hour.<eos> - I have to get to Cartagena.<eos> - Cartagena?<eos> Angel, you are hell and gone from Cartagena.<eos> Cartagena's over there on the coast.<eos> - But they told me this bus...<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - That man that...<eos> - That nice man who pulled a gun on you.<eos> What else did he tell you?
Well, I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.<eos> How stupid of me. But let me ask you this.<eos> Are you considering the possibility that you might be a sadistic pig?<eos> While we are baring our souls, Mr. Kornbluth, I must honestly tell you I have never considered you a man of science.<eos> You're not a member of my team.<eos> Run along, Walter.<eos> See if you can't find a unicorn.<eos> What's that?<eos> Painkiller, Mr. Kornbluth.<eos> Whoever punched you cracked your tooth.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.<eos> Why did you leave him on Genesis?<eos> Spock trusted you. And you denied him his future.<eos> - I saw no future.<eos> - Only his body was in death, Kirk.<eos> And you were the last one to be with him.<eos> Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.<eos> - But why?<eos> - Because he asked you to!<eos> He entrusted you with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body!

So you used to set this camera in this low position?<eos> YUHARU ATSUTA<eos> - CINEMATOGRAPHER<eos> This is a low-angle position.<eos> We used higher positions for shooting actors.<eos> Ozu decided on the composition himself.<eos> The assistant cameramen would unlock the camera like this so it would move.<eos> Then he would look?<eos> Yes. I steadied it here.<eos> So he would tell you when it was right?
The money you stole...<eos> Without bloodshed, Your Honour.<eos> Did you act out of idealism, to redistribute it?<eos> I'm generous.<eos> The investigation has revealed that, along with your love of good suits.<eos> Do you plead guilty of fraud and theft?<eos> Given the circumstances of my thefts and given my ideas...<eos> Just answer our questions.<eos> ...that reject all rules of any kind, I was hoping to be acquitted. Or, if sentenced, to escape and start again.<eos> Your words may go against you in the judges' minds.
Popcorn, medium.<eos> Hey mister, I'm looking for a Chinese guy.<eos> Yeah well he might be right down in the bottom.<eos> Smart ass.<eos> You see Mason, the most successful tricks are the easiest ones, it's that simple.<eos> Where's Steinberg?<eos> Yeah, I was just about to ask you the same question.<eos> Talk, Mason, or we'll rip your teeth out one by one.<eos> (chuckling) Except for one, 'cause it's a bomb.<eos> Playing for time will get you nowhere, Mr. Mason.
- Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> Barbara, did you just buzz me?<eos> Okay.<eos> No, everything's all right.<eos> - No, really. It didn't ring.<eos> - I could have sworn I heard it.<eos> I don't mean to intrude but I didn't hear from you... I was wondering if you'd heard from your husband and how he was doing.<eos> I don't know why I'm here.<eos> Come in.<eos> I don't know how much he told you about himself, about us.
This is real, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's 2,000 years old.<eos> You've got so many beautiful things.<eos> Most of it comes from my family.<eos> I love this piece.<eos> It's one of my favorites, too.<eos> She looks like you.<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, you know kind of like you.
Gonna show you what happens to bad little boys who poison their mothers.<eos> I'm going to kill you!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Norman. Norman Bates. The new cook's helper.<eos> Oh, yes. Dr. What's-His-Name called about you.<eos> Raymond. I'm the one who urged Mr. Statler to give you the job. I think it's very Christian to forgive and forget, don't you?<eos> - I sure do.<eos> - So do I. Myrna, this is Norman Bates.<eos> That's Myrna, Norman.<eos> Come on, I'll introduce you to Mr. Statler.
You'll be, uh... just fine in here.<eos> The bathroom?<eos> Is right over there.<eos> Uh, well,<eos> I guess it's time to, uh, to go to sleep.<eos> Good night, Mary.<eos> - About time, girl. - Sorry.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Sorry I missed you this morning.<eos> I got up early and went into town to see my girlfriend. You know, the one I was telling you about.
I'm telling you, it was right there.<eos> Sure it was.<eos> Don't humor me.<eos> I'm telling you there was a note on that wheel from my dead mother.<eos> Okay, everybody, business as usual.<eos> - Hi. Is that offer to room with you still open?<eos> Oh, sure!<eos> Great.<eos> Well, what... what happened?<eos> You know my girlfriend, the one I told you about? - Yeah.
It's only an empty car crate...<eos> Some people move out of it yesterday.<eos> Holy Virgin, give me the strength... to hold out here in Fort-de-France... in this wicked town...<eos> Too many people, too much noise, too many cars.<eos> You can't cross the street without being honked at.<eos> Listen to that! That's no life!<eos> Careful with your suit.<eos> Don't get it dirty for school.<eos> Don't worry, Grandma.<eos> You'll see, a month from now... when people ask you, "Where are you from?" You'll say:
It'll be shot off or kicked out.<eos> What else is new?<eos> They're not a bunch of junkies.<eos> To them, you killed Threlkis, same as shooting him.<eos> They'll keep coming after you.<eos> Good, we'll know where they are.<eos> You're incredible, Callahan.<eos> You're also on vacation as of right now.<eos> - I'm not up for vacation.<eos> - You are, I just put you up.
- He won't.<eos> Just get me the information.<eos> Names, where they are, where they work.<eos> It's not easy, inspector.<eos> I won't risk taking that photo off his wall.<eos> One other thing, could you get me Kruger's sheet?<eos> Anything else?<eos> Just the address.<eos> Mrs. Kruger?<eos> Can I have a word with you?
$40.55.<eos> $40.75.<eos> Hey, we're going in the wrong direction.<eos> Why do you have to be so goddamn nasty?<eos> I mean, it's not going to help anything.<eos> We're both people, you know?<eos> $40.75.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> Mrs Horton, I'm Sam Burns from the bank.<eos> I turned you down on the second on your house.
That's why we gave him the names and addresses.<eos> -What?<eos> -Of whom?<eos> People in the Underground.<eos> -He wrote them down?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> If he isn't stopped, we've sentenced the Polish Underground to death.<eos> -How is he getting to Warsaw?<eos> -By boat, then by train.<eos> Lieutenant, how long would it take you to fly to Warsaw?
-206.<eos> -Please.<eos> Good evening, Mrs. Bronski.<eos> I am Professor Siletski.<eos> -Siletski?<eos> -Is something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> I'm curious to know why I was brought here.<eos> I'll come to the point.<eos> I'm going to read something to you.
Videodrome is death.<eos> That's better.<eos> So much better.<eos> It's always painful to remove the cassette... to change the program.<eos> But now that we have... you'll see that you've become something quite different from what you were.<eos> You've become the video word made flesh.<eos> I am the video word made flesh.<eos> And now that you are the video word made flesh... you know what you have to do.<eos> You turn against Videodrome.<eos> You use the weapons they've given you to destroy them.
Robberies night after night!<eos> 57, rue des Récollets, there's a customer for you.<eos> - What did you do that for?<eos> - To accelerate your release.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> - Can you start it?<eos> - l'll handle it. Look, it's flooded.<eos> - Come on. - What?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What got into you?
FBI.<eos> - I'll read you your rights.<eos> - Step over to the van.<eos> You have the absolute right to remain silent.<eos> What did I do?<eos> You have the right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during questioning.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the court.<eos> - Do you understand these rights?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you willing to talk to me about the charges against you?
We'll read it and discuss it.<eos> Artyom Chachanidze.<eos> Lyric poems.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Soso, read it carefully and show it to the members of the editorial board.<eos> You can go now.<eos> The experiment is over, everybody come to my office.<eos> They are mostly love poems.<eos> Dear Shukri, excuse me.<eos> Vazha Zazayevich asked you to read it and show it to the board members.
I'll go to secretarial school and look for ajob.<eos> But the one thing I won't do is go into hospital.<eos> - And you'll be beaten and...<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Why not?<eos> Cos I'm gonna cooperate with him.<eos> Carla, you're a very intelligent woman.<eos> You'll always listen to reason, so now I wanna talk to you reasonably.
- And there are other differences.<eos> No light switches.<eos> We have to control the electricity.<eos> This, of course, is the children's room.<eos> The bed's in the wrong place.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> There are no ceilings anywhere in the house. That's for the television monitoring.<eos> Except, of course, in the bathroom.<eos> There is a ceiling, but no plumbing.<eos> We'll supply you with all the water you need.
Nothing, sorry.<eos> Day 1<eos> Where you goin'?<eos> Is there something for Simone?<eos> Day 2<eos> Could you look if there's something for Simone?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Look anyway.<eos> Next.<eos> I told you to look.
Is there something for Simone?<eos> Day 2<eos> Could you look if there's something for Simone?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Look anyway.<eos> Next.<eos> I told you to look.<eos> Yes?<eos> For Friedrich?<eos> I told you to look!
Stay where you are!<eos> You don't want to kill all these innocent people.<eos> - I don't care about them.<eos> - Joe, listen to me.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> No one's ever gotten away with a stunt like this before.<eos> Joe, the insurance is worthless now.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Joe, you got to trust me.<eos> No one will hurt you.
I'm going.<eos> - no, we toss for it!<eos> No, I've seen him first.<eos> He's mine.<eos> Excuse me, do we know each other?<eos> You don't, but I do.<eos> Adelina often told me about you, Paolo.<eos> Are you a relative from Crotone?<eos> Way more than a relative<eos> Adelina really loved you, you know?
Why don't you get some breakfast?<eos> You look like the hind end of a coon dog Just leaving the swamp.<eos> No, you promised!<eos> Michael,<eos> If you don't mind, i'd like to, uh...<eos> What's that?<eos> What's that bandage?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Nothing, you don't see<eos> I told you it's just a scratch.
Well, it's a matter of preference.<eos> I get mine done that way.<eos> Well, uh, what's the cost to get the tailoring done?<eos> The shirts will cost you ten dollars each. We can narrow the pants for five.<eos> They got some really nice boots here.<eos> You oughtta look at a pair, Charlie.<eos> I better take it easy.<eos> $125 clothing allowance, you know.<eos> I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> Buster can bill you for it. Give you some time to get caught up.
You'd do that for me?<eos> - Yeah, I would.<eos> - Oh, Rigby.<eos> Cody Jarrett's mother.<eos> Hello, Ma.<eos> My name is Reardon.<eos> I have important news for you.<eos> So just pretend I'm your ma, OK?<eos> The paper said you were hit in the head by a flying wrench in the machine shop.<eos> Friends of Carlotta are after you because you know too much.
Your clownish antics are amusing.<eos> I'd be inclined to laugh if your babble didn't contain what I would call a real and material threat.<eos> Let me tell you something, my fine lord bishop, something you might not understand.<eos> I can see through you.<eos> You're a cad of monumental proportions!<eos> Shut up, Gustav Adolf!<eos> Think of your blood pressure!<eos> I must apologize, my dear Edvard.<eos> Even if we have differing views in what seems to be an irresolνable conflict, we must behave like civilized beings.<eos> I disassociate myself entirely from Gustav Adolf's expressions and attitudes and assure you that he represents no one but himself.
As long as you relax, they relax.<eos> We are playing on their only real weakness.<eos> Because of its very size, the KGB is sometimes slow to awaken.<eos> It is like a monster.<eos> If you can walk by carefully, it may lift an eyelid and sniff at you.<eos> But if you awaken it...<eos> You have but one objective:<eos> You must reach the Krasnokholmskiy Bridge at 10:30 with your KGB tail in tow.<eos> At the rendezvous, you must obey the people you meet completely.<eos> Whatever they tell you to do you do.
- We're getting the royal treatment.<eos> - Yeah, go ahead, I'm listening.<eos> - Are you enjoying your ride, Mr. Gant?<eos> - You like our new toy?<eos> - It could be improved.<eos> - Your expert opinion, Mr. Gant?<eos> - You could say that.<eos> - Aren't you going to threaten me?<eos> - I'll do so if that is what you wish.<eos> But first, I'll merely ask you to return what does not belong to you.
I can't run. My knee hurts<eos> Anyway, I don't want to go into the Dolongs I want to go home<eos> Your mummy doesn't want us to come home right now<eos> Do as I say!<eos> Run into the Dolongs<eos> Run, I tell you!<eos> Well done, very nice!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - You idiot<eos> - What's got into you?
We're not going to Aldebaran anymore?<eos> That's exactly it!<eos> But we're paying you a fortune to take us to Aldebaran<eos> You can't break your word<eos> I didn't promise anything, Prince Matton<eos> Aldebaran was on my way and you asked to join the ship with half the public treasury that you pocketed<eos> - Only that which was mine<eos> - Don't make me laugh!<eos> The police of the Interplanetary Reformed Alliance are on your tail<eos> Your destination makes no difference to you It could be Aldebaran, or anywhere else, just as long as you get away
It's best that we each mind our own business<eos> "Business"? What's "business"?<eos> Humans have their way of doing things and we have our own<eos> I suppose you're right, but Prince Matton's thoughts still stink<eos> Right. From this point on, we can rely on the computer<eos> It'll put us in orbit around Gamma 10 until the Blue Comet passes<eos> Then it'll send us into its gravitational field<eos> Since we'll be orbiting Gamma 10 would we have enough time to land there?<eos> We could if we wanted to<eos> All right, I'll relieve you now
- 'Great beach.' - 'I'll be in New York.'<eos> - 'We'll go tomorrow.' - 'l gotta renew my visa.<eos> You all go.'<eos> - 'Next day.' - 'You shouldn't miss it.'<eos> - 'No, go.<eos> Go tomorrow.' - 'Day trip?<eos> 'Bring your camera. Bring your cameras.'<eos> - 'I'll stay home.'<eos> - That's all.<eos> Sir, your son is not what they told you.
- He's fine.<eos> He's OK.<eos> No problem.<eos> He's OK.<eos> Colours!<eos> Secure the halyard!<eos> Charlie, take care of that.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You didn't kick him out?<eos> Did he tell you what he's been going through?
Botany Bay...<eos> Botany Bay?<eos> !<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We've got to get out of here now!<eos> Damn!<eos> - What about the...<eos> - Never mind that!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Chekov, what's the matter with you?
As a teacher on a training mission, I'm happy to command the Enterprise.<eos> If we are to go on actual duty, the senior officer must assume command.<eos> It may be nothing.<eos> Garbled communications.<eos> You take the ship.<eos> You proceed from a false assumption.<eos> I'm a Vulcan.<eos> I have no ego to bruise.<eos> You remind me that logic dictates your actions?<eos> I would not remind you of that which you know so well.
There's a fire!<eos> Please stay here, Mr. Akutagawa.<eos> You forget I'm a reporter!<eos> Who's taking pictures?<eos> Don't run, don't run!<eos> Stay there!<eos> Stay there!<eos> I told you to stay there...<eos> I'll take you with me.<eos> I told you to stop taking pictures...
You smoke?<eos> Ah Nhac taught me to.<eos> Mr. Akutagawa!<eos> I was just looking for you!<eos> What is it?<eos> Only five days left on your visa.<eos> Shall I get it extended for you?<eos> No need, I've got what I want already.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Right, well, I won't keep you.
Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> My name is Ellie Grimbridge.<eos> I know.<eos> Dan Challis.<eos> - I know.<eos> One of the nurses told me, I could find you here.<eos> I saw you at the funeral. Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry about your father.<eos> Did my father say anything to you the night he died?
They're not very strong. You didn't like some of the jokes.<eos> Is that it?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Good. I can take care of that.<eos> Just tell me the ones you don't like, and no problem. Actually, that's a great help. Great.<eos> We think you have a good potential.<eos> Your timing is excellent.<eos> But you should keep developing your act.<eos> You ought to test it in a few live situations.<eos> I think that'd be very good for you.
Can you believe it?<eos> They can let creatures like that in here.<eos> Anne, what's the matter, huh?<eos> Anne? Oh!<eos> You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.<eos> Why are you such a derelict?<eos> Such a piece of human junk?<eos> The answer's simple.<eos> You're a scanner, but you don't realize it, and that has been the source of all your agony.<eos> But I will show you now that it can be a source of great power.
He's here to show us what may be done - and more essentially, what may not be.<eos> Jackson Scholz.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I'm Eric Liddell.<eos> Well, we've heard a lot about you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I was afraid you weren't here.<eos> I'm afraid I am, sir.<eos> Fine. Do you good.<eos> Take you out ofyourself a bit.
- Shut up, mister! Mr. Harris.<eos> You've just committed a felony punishable by two to ten years in the federal penitentiary.<eos> That's a bald eagle you're shooting at, and the American government takes it personally.<eos> We haven't shot any birds.<eos> I don't want to hear about it, Mr. Clagett. Tell it to the judge, all right?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> If you choose to speak, anything you say may be held against you.<eos> - You have the right to a lawyer.<eos> - Hey, you know, that's a $900 shotgun! ?<eos> Do we need the cuffs for you?
"Oliver Twist, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp down on a workman's bench and gazed about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people older than he will be at no loss to understand<eos> An unfinished coffin on black trestles which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object:<eos> from which he almost expected to see some frightful form... "<eos> - Serge.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I don't have any more money.<eos> I know, yesterday you gave me 3000 francs.<eos> Today I spent 5000 to buy two Irish horses.<eos> Etienne didn't like driving a carriage with only one horse.<eos> and so I don't ask you to believe me.
Countess of Perregaux.<eos> Would you like to see the real Algeria?<eos> There are beautiful gardens and the sky is almost always blue<eos> Alphonsine, I will board ship again in a few days.<eos> Are you asking me to follow you?<eos> No, I won't ask you.<eos> Now you have certain obligations toward me.<eos> - l know.<eos> - Now that I'm your wife.<eos> Even though it may seem absurd I ask you to let me be free.
One woman.<eos> What does she do?<eos> She lives, has an affair with our hero,<eos> - then she dies.<eos> - In the Blitz?<eos> No, he kills her.<eos> She broke his heart.<eos> I'd better get back, then.<eos> Come on.<eos> I hope Lucy didn't keep you up too late last night.
I went to the lighthouse.<eos> To get some fresh air?<eos> As you say the lighthouse is splendid... so I went to see it.<eos> There's people from Paris that -<eos> Okay!<eos> You saw the lighthouse.<eos> Then what?<eos> Then?<eos> Then?<eos> I already told you what I did!
You've held him for 3 hours...<eos> 'Held him' is a laugh...<eos> He's as slippery as a eel.<eos> I've noticed that perverts... have a remarkable intellect... How else would they dream it up?<eos> Those are police symbols...<eos> Border patrol...<eos> You have the badge for this one?<eos> 'The Valera girl had to be there'... 'so I could kill her'.<eos> When did I stop typing?<eos> When he called you an idiot.
Where's he going?<eos> Come on...<eos> Shit!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Martinaud don't be a fool!<eos> Come on, damn it!<eos> Don't move!<eos> No need to panic like that. What happened?<eos> Calm down.<eos> I didn't hurt you, right?
Except for bikes, Japanese is crap.<eos> This bomb was useless. You should have stolen a bike.<eos> And how did you wreck it?<eos> Ramming a streetlight.<eos> I would have prefered a cop, a family man...<eos> A fatty like you.<eos> Look, I'm not fat, I'm just well covered<eos> Antoine!<eos> What?<eos> What's up with you?
You'll understand if I tell you that before my marriage,<eos> I was living in St Louis district.<eos> That's nice.<eos> The odd-numbered side, you appreciate.<eos> Surely even better.<eos> Don't be fooled.<eos> It's not a sign of wealth, but one of status.<eos> You'll find the money on De Lattre Boulevard.<eos> Our dinner was often just a slice of ham, but my parents would never have moved.<eos> But all that is foreign to you, of course?
She is talking nonsense... and he's listening!<eos> Can I please go to the toilet and cut my wrists?<eos> You laugh about it, but it happens.<eos> At such an hour, a man doesn't know if he's joking or dreaming, or what he's doing.<eos> Detective?<eos> Could I ask you for your opinion now?<eos> My opinion Madam doesn't matter... because it will never change yours, will it?<eos> Mr Martinaud says he'll cut his wrists.<eos> Now what!<eos> What did Chantal Martinaud tell you?
Admit it.<eos> Admit that she came to tell you about that night.<eos> A motive to rape children.<eos> She came to speak about Camille... and everything is clear to you now.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> I am the... the ugly duckling.<eos> The Black Sheep.<eos> Of course it's so much easier to accept that version, than to believe a love story.<eos> What's happening Martinaud?<eos> What's with you?
I'm his father.<eos> Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.<eos> My name is...<eos> Robert calls me Willie.<eos> Excuse me, we haven't met. Robert knows very well I don't want to meet you.<eos> He was due back two days ago. I'm worried about him.<eos> Why are you worried?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just have a funny feeling.<eos> Did he tell you what he's doing in Germany?
We're all wondering why you asked us to come here.<eos> We asked you to come here to tell the world once and for all that Jewish propaganda is pure lies.<eos> They had no scruples about using one of the most famous and beloved German singers for their smear campaign.<eos> Radio London and Radio Calais spread the infamous lie that the singer of "Lili Marleen" was murdered in a camp.<eos> This is your chance to show loyalty to the great German Reich... and the Fuhrer.<eos> That's all we ask of you.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You don't want us to confirm the news from the BBC... do you?<eos> The time when you could threaten me is over, when I couldn't fall asleep because I was afraid to wake up. I'm not afraid anymore, can't you see?<eos> This might interest you.

"I know how to interpret the letter of the law,<eos> "but I want to learn how to carry things out in a generous way."<eos> Something like that, you know.<eos> There are too many bureaucrats who are a little too dutiful.<eos> I have nothing against bureaucrats doing their duty.<eos> That would be a misunderstanding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sense of duty, that's just for lack of... We're still talking about the same thing.<eos> We should learn to look beyond the fine print and see the big picture. That's what I mean...<eos> That's what we... Our Mr Esslin will introduce you to all the gentlemen.
Nice to meet you again.<eos> The Prime Minister sent for me.<eos> I hope this doesn't last too long.<eos> Always problems with the old statues.<eos> Shall we tear them down or not?<eos> As if that were important for our future.<eos> I'd like to sculpt a bust of you, Höfgen.<eos> What sort of man are you? Your own face differs amazingly from Mephisto.<eos> In private you don`t look devilish, but rather shy.<eos> I'll do a bust of you, but in clay or in bronze?
- Very sensible of you.<eos> But may I ask why not?<eos> I had the impression that you were tremendously interested in finding your wife.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> I suppose I still am.<eos> But that was out of pure, blind ambition.<eos> And you know something?<eos> I don't feel like there's anything much ambitious left in me.<eos> I see.<eos> So I don't even have to ask you as a personal favour not to come to the office until I contact you.
I'm not Arthur.<eos> How can I help you, Commander Beaumont?<eos> Open the curtains, turn on the light, and die, Mr. President.<eos> I can see the corner of an office and make out a silhouette.<eos> They just turned a light on.<eos> Is that a signal, or what?<eos> I'm sure the President had the clever idea to make the other idiot stand in broad daylight, so I can kill him with one shot.<eos> Farges, you should know if it's him.<eos> You just saw him at the morgue, where he was dead.<eos> I told you that I had a gun pointed here.
- You know as much as I do.<eos> - Well, who...<eos> Who's gonna be in charge of the summer session?<eos> I'm not sure there'll be a summer session.<eos> What?<eos> Goodbye, Mr Moreland.<eos> They're worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success.<eos> - How much time has elapsed since...<eos> - 18 hours and 12 minutes.<eos> Dr McCoy must have told you...
Look, we're your new partners.<eos> We're in for ten points.<eos> What'd this set you back?<eos> Ten points of what?<eos> You know.<eos> The guy?<eos> Leo.<eos> Your action.<eos> I don't get this.<eos> What's with you?
The TV-set is in a fine working order.<eos> You really can behave.<eos> Pass on, pass on!<eos> No hard feelings?<eos> I was waiting for you.<eos> I were to find you in a flop house, but the street is sealed off.<eos> I thought I would find you here, and I am lucky.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know, my principle is not to chase the luck, only to wait calmly till it turns up itself.<eos> I am from BONUS AND BONUS attorneys - at-law and I have a request to you.
Oh, hello, this is Marion Stowe.<eos> Doctor Marion Stowe. Of the Institute of Toxicology.<eos> Toxicology.<eos> That's... that's poisons, isn't it?<eos> Everything's gone wrong. He's gone crazy.<eos> You see today, we had a shipment in that was supposed to be a black mamba, which is probably the most poisonous snake in the whole world.<eos> Mrs. Loewenthal remembers a boy coming in to collect a snake after our man had been there.<eos> The boy's order was for an African house snake, so you see...<eos> You may have got his order, and he may have got yours.<eos> Excuse me, sir. Mr. Kepler called again to say he really won't keep you waiting much longer and hopes you'll forgive the delay.
Gee-whiz, terrific.<eos> - Okay, Dan. - Yes, sir?<eos> That's it, then. We're gonna have to tell 'em.<eos> - They won't believe you, sir.<eos> - No, I wouldn't think so.<eos> There's a 10-year-old boy in that house.<eos> I'm aware. I'm aware of that.<eos> - What do you want me to do? - I want you to tell them.<eos> Tell them the truth.<eos> And no harm will come to you. I'll be there standing right next to you.
Just watch the boy.<eos> Come on, quick.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> You don't have to do this, you know.<eos> Yes, I do know.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Hello? I've come to help you.<eos> I have an injection here that's going to help you.<eos> You have to turn over now. I'm... I'm not going to hurt you.
So you know where we hide our cash?<eos> That's why you sailed into the channel with so much assurance.<eos> Don't get any ideas, Captain.<eos> I had the crew put a can of gasoline in your cabin.<eos> The last one alive will set fire to it.<eos> You're a very clever man, Captain.<eos> I'm going to try to live up to that compliment.<eos> Try to understand, that opium really belongs to us.<eos> The dealers will pay us a good price for it.<eos> What I'm offering you is something more precious...
I haven't noticed the marker.<eos> Look at this, Watson.<eos> An ultimate thief's kit.<eos> Glazier's diamonds, a knife, and a set of master-keys.<eos> Objects born out of the progress of civilization.<eos> And here... Look.<eos> Look at this beauty!<eos> A thief's flashlight.<eos> I'm going to rob Milverton.<eos> I always told you I'd make a good thief.
Zero!<eos> I lost, gentlemen.<eos> A revenge?<eos> Winnings corrupt the soul.<eos> Besides, I'm in a hurry.<eos> Think of it as your dinner becoming more expensive by 5 pounds.<eos> A good doctor is worth it.<eos> All the best, gentlemen.<eos> Pardon me, sir.<eos> The Colonel asked to remind you once again, that you owe him 420 pounds.
Get down, you fool.<eos> What if somebody see me taking passengers out of bus stop and report me?<eos> Come on, get down.<eos> Rules are rules.<eos> You want a ticket?<eos> Go on, Misko.<eos> Go on, son.<eos> Two to Belgrade.<eos> - 40 dinars.<eos> Please let me give up my sit for you.
Don't go.<eos> Michelle Stratton is paying for my services, Julian.<eos> I think you know this is a matter of some secrecy.<eos> Tell her not to bother.<eos> Julian, you'll have to help us more.<eos> You tell Michelle to forget me.<eos> I'm more worried about your defence, Julian, than about her private life.<eos> We'll must go into the details the night of the murder.<eos> The maid saw you trying to save Leon, so the police are only pressing the Rheiman case.<eos> The papers and TV are trying you already.
I switched it off myself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hauptmann Netusil. - Go up. I'll join you in a minute.<eos> Stay here.<eos> - Hauptmann Netusil. - Yes. Speaking.<eos> Alex?<eos> You came.<eos> Well, we've decided it took me about 20 minutes to drive here.<eos> Where was she when you entered?<eos> Mrs. Vognic rang you between 1:00 and 1:30... which means she was in a condition to dial and talk.
No problem.<eos> We'll have it for you in the morning.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No.<eos> I will not take your filthy, stolen money!<eos> Well, then.<eos> I guess you're really up shit creek.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I offered to help you.
- I said I can't afford no more.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What did he say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Brubaker, I can't afford no more.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> I said, nothing.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
They see something they don't like, they shoot it up or burn it down.<eos> Make up their own laws as they go along.<eos> I didn't make up those laws. You did.<eos> Because they've held up our businesses.<eos> They've raped our daughters and murdered our sons.<eos> And so we make them wards of the state which means we accept responsibility to feed them, to clothe them give them medical attention.<eos> Not to starve them, not to torture them, not to humiliate them.<eos> And if you don't like the laws, then change them.<eos> In the meantime, it's my job-<eos> It's your job to listen to the people who pay you.
Well, hi.<eos> I'm Liz from the escort service.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> - It's me.<eos> - Well, hi.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad to meet you.<eos> Well, are you going to pump me dry here or invite me in?<eos> I'm sorry, come in.<eos> Well, come on, let's go.<eos> Look, forget that address I just gave you.
Thank you very much.<eos> I'm sure we shall all try.<eos> I move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted on a permanent basis provided the hospital receives a yearly sum for the cost of one bed.<eos> All those in favour?<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> The motion is carried.<eos> Yes, come in!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Mr. Carr-Gomm has something he wants to say to you.<eos> Mr. Merrick, I am very pleased in being able to welcome you officially to the London Hospital.
Thank you.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - You're perfectly welcome, sir.<eos> That, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any ofour scopes.<eos> Considering the damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.<eos> No, Captain, they're alive.<eos> I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.<eos> - Lord Vader.<eos> - Yes, Admiral. What is it?<eos> The emperor commands you to make contact with him.
"Air in his anorak must have kept him afloat as he remembers nothing else."<eos> "He was picked up by a Goldhawk vessel from the weir about ten in the morning.<eos> He'd been in the water five hours."<eos> "They gave my husband the day off and said he was lucky they'd found him."<eos> "Wrallis became blind two days later and he kept falling over."<eos> Wrallis Fallanway is registered as a middle-aged male man suffering from Ménière's disease, migraine and apoplexy.<eos> His lips grew calloused, his tongue diminished and a nictitating membrane on his left eye operated involuntarily in conditions of bright light, making his vision sparkle with refracted lights.<eos> "They sent me a certificate which said that the Goldhawk Fisheries Company named the lake, number 11 lake, after my husband, the Wrallis Fallanway Lake."<eos> "They gave me a case of stuffed fish. They look like flying fish."<eos> "Here's hoping my knowledge of my husband's case can help you."
Why don't you ask me with your life,<eos> I am guilty!<eos> and then...<eos> What do I give you?<eos> my coloboration?<eos> No<eos> You are too late for bargains Muktar<eos> You are far too later<eos> I have not asked you for my life<eos> Do not tell the world, in the privacy of this room I asked you for my life
I was not born to be a wife, but to be lover. I do not know what to do with men!<eos> Count slows and leaves me with you.<eos> Men do not have sensitivity, delicacy, passion ... are whiteflies, rare, but there.<eos> The heart does not matter?<eos> How does not count!<eos> They believe as in the Middle Ages the woman has no heart.<eos> Do you have a heart wonderful, do not understand anything!<eos> Sometimes I think today only those like you are able to have feelings.<eos> My feelings are in place. Nothing is missing.<eos> Someone like you should know the woman at the right time.
These are the enlightened films of today.<eos> "Where are you going, Christian?"<eos> "To swap stamps."<eos> "That's fine."<eos> They showed us other films in biology class.<eos> "Come in, I've been expecting you."<eos> Do you think that's right?<eos> I don't think that's right.<eos> "Oh, wow?"<eos> Look what I brought you.
isn't this a sad life?<eos> Why, Mr.?<eos> I know I'm an eccentric.<eos> Like a jay, just like a feather duster.<eos> You want to keep them all!<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Please, call me Marcel - just once!<eos> But why not?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> I'm so grateful to you for agreeing to tend a sick man.
He then began calling me Celeste, and so it remained.<eos> I must meet the Countess Chevigne'.<eos> All right, Mr.<eos> Do you think I might possibly be too weak, dear Celeste?<eos> It'll be fine because you want it to.<eos> Phone her to find out if she's free tonight.<eos> All right, Mr.<eos> I'd like to meet the Countess at the Ritz.<eos> Could you, in case she agrees, call Mr. Dabescat, and have the small lilac room reserved?<eos> May I ask you to hurry up?
- Newspaper? - The Telegraph.<eos> Thank you, good night.<eos> Rosewood, mahogany, teak?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> What would you like your breakfast tray made of?<eos> I don't really mind.<eos> Fine, go along, have a really good night's sleep, then. I'm hoping to get a couple of hours myself.<eos> I'll be up in good time to serve you your breakfast in bed.<eos> If you can remember to sleep with your mouth open, you won't even have to wake up.<eos> I'll drop in small pieces of lightly buttered kipper when you're breathing in the right direction, if that doesn't put you out!
I think this is probably the worst hotel we've ever stayed in.<eos> The service here is an absolute disgrace!<eos> - I agree. - You do?<eos> Yes.<eos> We had to wait nearly half an hour for our main course, and when it arrived, it was wrong.<eos> I complained, but he fobbed me off with some rubbish about...<eos> My prawns were off.<eos> When I told him, there was an argument.<eos> And her meat was awfully poor.<eos> And I asked you to fix my radiator three times, and nothing's been done!
We have nothing to talk.<eos> Don't you ever do something wrong.<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - My wife is ill.<eos> We got married, our first baby died. She lost the second one.<eos> The third one died too 2 hours after he was born.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 18.<eos> Lie over there.<eos> Tell me what's wrong with you.
A real independent type.<eos> He's practically my client, since I represented his ex-wife.<eos> They just got divorced under the new law.<eos> You don't say!<eos> Antoine is divorced.<eos> Should I offer condolences or congratulations?<eos> Napoleon used the law to dump Josephine. Right, Antoine?<eos> What did you decide about the Draguignan case?<eos> The more everyone discourages me, the more inclined I am to take it.<eos> They discourage you 'cause they care about you.
You're my little sister, my daughter, my mother.<eos> I'd have liked to be your wife too.<eos> A few years later, when we were back together, a new character entered the scene.<eos> Liliane was part femme fatale, part tomboy, the opposite of Christine in every way, yet in every way what Christine wanted to be.<eos> I've always wanted to play.<eos> Should I buy a violin right away?<eos> No, it's too early.<eos> Better to rent for now. Fine.<eos> I'll be back on Saturday.<eos> I'll tell you then where you can rent one. All right.
There's a place in the river, I can't remember. It must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.<eos> It's all wild and overgrown now, but for about five miles, you'd think that heaven just fell on the Earth,<eos> Have you ever considered any real freedoms?<eos> Freedoms from the opinion of others?<eos> Even the opinions of yourself?<eos> Did they say why, Willard?<eos> Why they wanted to terminate my command?<eos> I was sent on a classified mission, sir.<eos> No longer classified, is it?<eos> What did they tell you?
Do you know Raphael?<eos> No, sir. I don't believe I do.<eos> Because I have a message for him.<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> A small black man gave me a message for Raphael.<eos> I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, please lie still.<eos> Is there anyone we could notify for you?<eos> No. The old man died and Louise left.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I do hope your injury won't prevent you from attending to business.
Oh, God.<eos> She's heavily sedated.<eos> My darling.<eos> Any one of them could have done it.<eos> Sir Alec, Ivo, and Charles, Helene. And Mr Williams.<eos> Your father's guide was not a guide.<eos> I know.<eos> Did Mr Williams tell you that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did Mr Williams tell you that there was someone other than the guide with your father?
- Who ordered the SWAT team in?<eos> - He was out of control, dangerous.<eos> Mr. Spindler, do you agree?<eos> Was he disturbed?<eos> - Had he reason to be disturbed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Had he been drinking?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> What did he say to you?
- He was out of control, dangerous.<eos> Mr. Spindler, do you agree?<eos> Was he disturbed?<eos> - Had he reason to be disturbed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Had he been drinking?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> - What did he say to you?
And why give all this importance to the peasants?<eos> Forget them. Don't listen to their idle talk.<eos> The peasants are superstitious and ignorant.<eos> And the more you do for them, the more ungrateful they are.<eos> You should mix with gentleman of your own rank.<eos> We are the State. You offended yourself, by using these words.<eos> Well, yes, I can't say you're wrong on this head.<eos> You see, you must admit I'm right.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> The kids that belong to the GIL the people from the school, the schoolteacher the war widows, the Florentine ladies the Red Cross ladies, the mother shopkeepers, journalists, police officers in other words, don Luigino what we are used to call "the Italian people" would agree with you, right now.
- No, actually, it's blood.<eos> Oh, shaving.<eos> I like a man who shaves smoothly.<eos> Major Dapes, I find the role of procurer very distasteful to me.<eos> - So if you don't like her, then...<eos> - You don't like me?<eos> But I am beautiful.<eos> Yes, you are. it's just that I try to avoid that which I cannot afford.<eos> it's OK. You can afford.<eos> Come. I take you to another casino where I am very lucky for you.
You have to.<eos> The Olympics should help the economy... but there's no telling if we'll see the benefits in textiles.<eos> You have to keep your promise.<eos> I'm getting a cramp in my foot.<eos> Don't worry, I promise.<eos> Professor, I wish you'd tell my daughter she should break up with that young fellow.<eos> I'm just passing through.<eos> It's not my place.<eos> But you're a university professor.<eos> She'll listen to you.
Why are you here?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Peace.<eos> We have no bad intentions with your planet.<eos> Don't be in our way and we'll remain friends.<eos> We have come to study the customs and behaviour of the earthlings by mingling with the people.<eos> You have a lively imagination.<eos> Our research area is Saint-Tropez during the holiday months.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> Get lost or I'll show you what my research area is.
- Who the fuck is that?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I've been paying you every week for four months-<eos> - I'm splitting.<eos> - I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim.<eos> This is research, damn it.<eos> That girl could have told us something.<eos> Research?<eos> I suppose these are the extra expenses I've been paying you.
- Can't see in my eye.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Where's the emergency room? !<eos> How did this happen?<eos> He fell off the jungle gym.<eos> He had a plane in his hand.<eos> I'm just about through.<eos> - Don't hurt him.<eos> - I won't hurt him.<eos> Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?
And re-entering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft.<eos> This is the centrifuge trainer.<eos> It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space.<eos> The speed is controlled from up there.<eos> Why not try it?<eos> Why not?<eos> Strap yourself in firmly.<eos> Yes, Doctor!<eos> Now your arms.<eos> That's to prevent you from knocking yourself out.
Did I?<eos> As you said, such good sport.<eos> You called for me, Mr Drax?<eos> You were with Bond last night in my study.<eos> You showed him the safe.<eos> - l didn't.<eos> - l'm terminating your employment.<eos> You will leave immediately.<eos> Franco, I'll call you where to meet me.<eos> - Could I interest you in something?
If I get lost I'll take a cab.<eos> - Do you come with the suite?<eos> - It depends who's renting it.<eos> Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.<eos> - Why were you following me?<eos> - l was trying to meet you.<eos> I'm Manuela. I work for Station VH.<eos> We have been asked to assist you.<eos> M thinks of everything.<eos> Tell me, do the initials C and W mean anything to you?
Some connoisseurs!<eos> This is what you think about all the time?<eos> God forbid.<eos> I seldom think.<eos> It's bad for me.<eos> It's impossible to write and keep thinking about success or failure.<eos> Naturlich.<eos> But on the other hand, if my books aren't being read in 100 years, why bother to write?<eos> Tell me, Professor, why did you get involved in this business?<eos> What's the Zone to you?
What happened?<eos> Why did you stop me?<eos> - I didn't stop you.<eos> - Who did then?<eos> You?<eos> What the hell.<eos> You're a fine one, Mr. Shakespeare.<eos> Afraid to advance, ashamed to retreat.<eos> So you order yourself to stop in a false voice.<eos> Fear's sobered you up.
He crawled on his knees to plead for his brother, but he got a pile of money. He couldn't get anything else.<eos> Porcupine was given the essence of his true nature.<eos> Conscience and soul-searching were all invented by the mind.<eos> When he realized all that, he hanged himself.<eos> I won't go into your Room.<eos> I don't want to pour the filth in my soul onto anyone's head — even yours — and then hang myself as Porcupine did.<eos> Better to stay grunting in my stinking private villa.<eos> You're a bad judge of human nature if you bring people like me into the Zone.<eos> How did you learn that this miracle actually exists?<eos> Who told you that desires really come true here?
-Checkmate.<eos> -How does he do it?<eos> -Not again?<eos> -Every time.<eos> I know how he thinks.That's all.<eos> -One day I shall win.<eos> -When you learn how I think.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.Two gentlemen from Scotland Yard want a word with you.<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> Beg pardon, sir. Might we have a word with you?
The coppers searched high and low.<eos> We were by the door the whole time.<eos> If he fooled them this long, no surprise he's done it again.<eos> -What did you say?<eos> -We were by the door the whole time.<eos> When you learn how I think. 1979.<eos> What have I done?<eos> I've turned that bloody maniac loose upon utopia.<eos> -Mr.Wells-- -Bring me all the housekeeping money.<eos> And any money you have of your own. I'll make it up to you.
What a coincidence.<eos> Like some sort of a trap.<eos> She died horribly.<eos> Alone.<eos> Well, why did she choose to die?<eos> Never mind that!<eos> But she'll have her revenge against you. Get out!<eos> Hello,<eos> Ma'am, it's already a noon!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Yes, with the greatest of pleasure.<eos> (Laughter)<eos> That end bit just one more time?<eos> What, this bit, you mean?<eos> When he's trotting, does he sound like this?<eos> Nay, nay, nay, nay.<eos> No, he sounds more like this.<eos> This?<eos> No, no.<eos> I told you he sounds like this.
I've no one else left, do you see?<eos> I just want to make sure he goes to a good home.<eos> Somebody who's'll take care of him.<eos> You're being a bit pessimistic, aren't you, Mr Dean?<eos> You were the only one I could think of.<eos> Don't you worry about it, Mr Dean.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, did, er...<eos> Did you ever smoke that cigar I once gave you, Mr Herriot?
- Please, not in front of Tricki.<eos> Oh, there was no need to write, though Tricki and I are dying to know how you all got on.<eos> That's really why we're here, although I can see it's inconvenient.<eos> It's never inconvenient for you - and Tricki.<eos> Do sit down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> l-l'm afraid Siegfried's out.<eos> So's Helen.<eos> Uncle Herriot's having a bath so you'll have to make do with me, I'm afraid.<eos> And they left you in charge of everything?
Now clear off my land.<eos> Not so fast, my dear chap.<eos> We've no intention of paying you a sou.<eos> - A what?<eos> - A penny, if you prefer.<eos> Oh, you haven't, have you?<eos> Well, there's a remedy to that.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> No doubt your legal advisors,<eos> Messrs Bullock, Gagg and Wagstaff - it does have a certain ring to it - have advised you to take us to court if we don't oblige.
And in that condition, well, who'd want him?<eos> I do.<eos> I can make him better, I know I can!<eos> I don't think you could cope...<eos> - Not cope!<eos> I've coped with animals for years.<eos> I'm not the one to ask, really.<eos> It's the RSPCA<eos> - Mr Halliday.<eos> Inspector, you let me have him and I'll soon show you what a healthy dog looks like.
But a shock, I suppose.<eos> Better come and have a drink.<eos> Oh, please, don't blame your brother.<eos> It was entirely my fault.<eos> That's very, very nice of you.<eos> Come along.<eos> You look as if you could do with one, too.<eos> Bring Tizer with you.<eos> We'll deal with him later.<eos> (Siegfried) Now, Mrs Farmer, what I prescribe for you is a large glass...
What is it you'd like me to do, Mr Grier?<eos> I've got a tricky bit of business coming on one of the outlying farms.<eos> In that case, of course I'll come.<eos> - Good lad.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> Hm.<eos> They've got a cow that's doing poorly.<eos> Bad case of retained afterbirth.<eos> That's a one-man job, isn't it, Mr Grier.<eos> I wouldn't ask you for your help if I didn't need to.
Mr Dawson's account.<eos> - Yes, there we are.<eos> Aye, vet always comes straightaway, so I think it's only fair that we should pay up on time.<eos> Aye.<eos> That's very kind of you say that, Mr Dawson.<eos> Er...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Er, there you are.<eos> - Thank you very much indeed.<eos> My brother will receipt that for you.
Yes, Mrs Hall?<eos> - Mrs Butler.<eos> One of their calves is bleeding summat bad.<eos> Well, I am rather busy.<eos> - She says it can't wait or it might die.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Right.<eos> I don't like t'size on it, Mr Farnon, I don't like it at all.<eos> I certainly wouldn't knowingly overcharge you.
Does Barry Kohler's life have anything to do with you?<eos> - You have no right to talk that way.<eos> - Is Barry Kohler still alive?<eos> - How do I know?<eos> - Mr. Lieberman, Barry is dead.<eos> You know that, and I know that.<eos> And that's why I'm here-- To pick up where he left off.<eos> That means with you.<eos> I work alone.<eos> I'm not asking you for a job.
That is unusual.<eos> Studies show that twins who are separated at birth... develop totally different personalities.<eos> But these twins, or perhaps I should say triplets, because I believe that my associate saw another, we're like the same people, but brought up, eh, with different languages.<eos> It's impossible, of course.<eos> Excuse me, Doctor, but what is impossible?<eos> What is impossible, Doctor?<eos> Mononuclear reproduction.<eos> Oh, Doctor.<eos> Cloning.<eos> What if I were to tell you that I could take a scraping of skin from your finger... and create another Ezra Lieberman?
Do you know what I was thinking?<eos> After the war, $1 million.<eos> You, a simple peasant girl from where?<eos> I can never pronounce the name of the place you come from.<eos> With so much money, we could...<eos> They're lying.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Out!<eos> Get out.<eos> What did I tell you?
And if we do, you'll shoot us and bury us in the same hole.<eos> I shall certainly shoot you if you don't.<eos> Well, gentlemen, the choice is yours.<eos> What I can't figure is how the firewood got in the case.<eos> Neither can I.<eos> Don't know where we're going to find any spare penicillin here, do you?<eos> What are we going to do, keep walking until we reach the Adriatic?<eos> I don't think the iron maiden will let us get that far.<eos> Halt!<eos> What did I tell you?
No stops.<eos> I'm sorry about Marko.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a risk we all take.<eos> He was a brave man and a good friend.<eos> Pity he got careless.<eos> Do you think that big sergeant spotted him as a Partisan?<eos> I can't buy that.<eos> The sergeant wasn't that bright.<eos> He saluted you, you're wearing a corporal's uniform.
- Let go, Cheryl. Let go.<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - Please let go.<eos> - Cheryl!<eos> - Tell me!<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Help me!<eos> I put some cookies in a bag for you.
Could you give me a light, please?<eos> I'm sitting around here and don't know where to get a light.<eos> Otherwise, just pretend I'm not here...<eos> Thanks.<eos> -would you like one?<eos> -No, thanks.<eos> Are you going to hang yourself? .<eos> Naturally.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Does this building belong to you?
It's all right, the Assistant Commissioner wants a word with you.<eos> Your office said you were on the way to his publishers, I just wanted a word.<eos> Your privilege.<eos> - Are you on anything else? - Yes, sir.<eos> - there was a knifing in Clapham Common.<eos> - Drop it.<eos> We want to know who did it.<eos> So do I.<eos> I'm glad it fell to you.<eos> We wouldn't dream of taking you off it.
You wait in the kitchen.<eos> - I'm sorry to disturb you.<eos> - Not at all, I was glad to get your call.<eos> I'm here for such a short time...<eos> You've made it warm, it's what I expected.<eos> - could I offer you a drink?<eos> - Whisky, please.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> - Anything? - No, as it is.<eos> I lied to you when I told you I'd never seen him again.
For a moment he had turned me to a stone.<eos> A response at last.<eos> I knew as long as he lived that there was no way of stopping it.<eos> And I failed.<eos> I couldn't tell anyone, no one would believe me.<eos> They'd say the madness was mine.<eos> And perhaps it was.<eos> Then we are mad together.<eos> I have seen the Cathedral and I think I know what's keeping him alive.<eos> There's nothing you can do, no one will believe you.
- To begin with Morlar isn't dead.<eos> He's fighting to live with superhuman resistance, right?<eos> - against all reason.<eos> - all right.<eos> Against all reason he believed he had the power to destroy a plane.<eos> To shatter a Cathedral.<eos> He's alive, so is the belief.<eos> He said he would do it, I believe he will.<eos> How?<eos> I told you about those experiments.
If I like?<eos> Does my mother cook spaghetti?<eos> To the Gannet transaction.<eos> Shall I tell Douvier we're on our way?<eos> Don't forget the money.<eos> What?<eos> Throat!<eos> Back!<eos> Choking!<eos> You want me to hit you on the back.
I didn't think it could be you...<eos> It's me.<eos> Don't tell me you've forgotten.<eos> Commissioner?<eos> Chief Commissioner!<eos> Mr. Zenigata... eat slowly.<eos> Here's some pickled radish and marinated fish roe.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I haven't eaten lately.<eos> It must have been hard on you to be away from Japan for so long.
That's a bad outfit.<eos> Okay, move these people.<eos> My God! Look up there.<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> Easy, miss. I've got you.<eos> You've got me?<eos> Who's got you?<eos> I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.<eos> Gentlemen, this man needs help.<eos> I hope this little incident hasn't put you off flying, miss.
He can't stay still for a second.<eos> Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.<eos> Yeah, poor Clark.<eos> He's never around when....<eos> Clark....<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What?<eos> Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.<eos> I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.<eos> I think he really cares about you.
I don't think we can hold them very long, though.<eos> And that green line, that's their furthest point of advance?<eos> - That's right.<eos> What are the blue dots?<eos> Those are mobil stations.<eos> That must be major mills.<eos> - Take over.<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> I'm glad you could make it, sir.<eos> I think we've got something that will interest you.
- Did you write it to Cleofe?<eos> - I did.<eos> Why do you think I would agree?<eos> Why would I live with you?<eos> I wrote it just because I wasn't sure and I wanted to make it a deal done!<eos> And now I have to defend myself and show everything what a disgrace!<eos> .<eos> You have to marry me, you are mine forever!<eos> My dearest, I love you so much, I want to marry you...<eos> Your Honour, may I present you officially my fiancee.
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.<eos> Take my coat, please. - Yes, sir.<eos> My respects, Colonel.<eos> A 1937 Mosel in the southernmost corner of Russia.<eos> Remarkable!<eos> A bottle of Mosel is no more out of place in this region than we are ourselves.<eos> Your health, gentlemen.<eos> I'm not going to drink to my health. It's not worth drinking to.<eos> To the end of the war?<eos> Colonel, why does our presence here strike you as so absurd?
"My father had a moustache."<eos> "We lived in a house near the harbor."<eos> It's starting all over again.<eos> The last time was three months ago.<eos> Now it's starting again.<eos> Good morning Mr. Zimmermann, I was expecting your call.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Listen, I have a proposition for you...<eos> Come to Paris and see a doctor to get a new opinion about your... state of health.<eos> I already made a date for you... with a hemotologist.
It worried me very much.<eos> I'd like to know how things really are.<eos> If I put it off, I'll never do it.<eos> Suppose the telegram wasn't from Allan?<eos> Who else would have sent it?<eos> Wake up, Mr. Zimmermann.<eos> Excuse me, I'm late.<eos> You had a good flight?<eos> You feeling well?<eos> I took the appointment for you at 10 o'clock at the hospital.
I'm not disturbing you?<eos> Not at all. On the contrary.<eos> - May I take your coat?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Would you Iike a cup of coffee?<eos> - Very much, thank you.<eos> - How are you, Conchita?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> So I see.<eos> Sir, as soon as I can, I'll repay you for Conchita's ticket.
"Do you love me?<eos> - Yes."<eos> Is it true?<eos> It's just a song.<eos> I didn't write the words.<eos> I think of you constantly.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Conchita!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What's the matter with you?
--thousands of others are homeless.<eos> U.S. Army Materiel Command has issued these new area restrictions.:<eos> All roadways north of Crowheart on lnterstate 25.<eos> All roads leading into the Grand Tetons west of Meteste.<eos> All multilane undivided full traffic interchange railroad, local and historic stage roads south of Cody.<eos> Why aren't there fat lines instead of these thin ones?<eos> You're going the wrong way!<eos> Turn back around.<eos> Back this way.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- But I must.<eos> - Go now.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> - Go now.<eos> - I won't.<eos> May I ask you here?<eos> Could you spare me a minute?<eos> I want to say this in private. As a friend.<eos> You don't like me but I always have liked you and very much so.
Well, don't get angry, I only wanted to...<eos> You had to talk later on.<eos> Yes, you must have talked, he wouldn't... OK.<eos> What did he say? No, no.<eos> I beg of you, please, tell me.<eos> Oh, you should have said it right from the beginning. Please, sit down, please.<eos> No problem, have something to eat.<eos> If you excuse me, you don't look as if you were overeating recently.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> It's all for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> This has to look real.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let me teach her a lesson!<eos> Let me through.<eos> Kassim sent me.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> All right, come in.<eos> The Emir would like to speak to you... and the two American women that arrived today.
Bye-bye.<eos> Send the ladies in.<eos> Good morning, my dears.<eos> I hope you rested well.<eos> Yes, very well, thank you.<eos> We needed it. Now I know what they mean when they say...<eos> - you Arabs have energy resources.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's a very flattering compliment.<eos> I was to tell you that Dr. Robertson sends his regards.
I can help her.<eos> only I can help her...<eos> Leave us alone!<eos> we don't wanna hear about demons or God or anything!<eos> Just get out of here!<eos> They put you in a hospital.<eos> Dr. Tuskin doesn't understand.<eos> - Did you find the man with the leopard?<eos> - I did.<eos> Did he tell you how to fight Pazuzu?
Mrs. Fowler loves it too!<eos> Mr. Fowler made his fortune in the stock market, they say.<eos> - Right!<eos> - But one of Mrs. Fowler's friends was telling me he is an alcoholic!<eos> Ah, really?<eos> Well, you're released now, Mr. Wagstaff.<eos> What, already?<eos> We'll comb you out after the the mud mask.<eos> Watch out, Mrs. Wagstaff, or the gloss will smear up.<eos> Your new hair color suits you perfectly and the Jungle Red on your feet is world class.
I've examined your father and I must tell you, in my professional capacity he is deeply disturbed.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> If they know I'm here, they'll harm my father.<eos> You're late, they're waiting.<eos> I'll be right down.<eos> That's Brophy, my driver.<eos> He's all right.<eos> Miss Brisbane, I'm terribly sorry. I must go.<eos> They're waiting for me.<eos> Don't you believe what I'm telling you?
I wrote about what seemed important or what seemed merely odd.<eos> The ancient past, the recent past... even the encounter with the crying little girl.<eos> "If I had a pretty red dress like yours... I wouldn't cry."<eos> From that inner journey, I emerged like a sleepwalker.<eos> I felt exhilarated... exhausted... walking on air... stiff, yet laughing with fatigue.<eos> On September 9 I collated the manuscript... and wrote "The End. "<eos> Only the title was missing.<eos> Without wasting any time... I took the first one that came to mind... the one that summed up the absurdity of my life.: The Skirt Chaser.<eos> Taking Dr. Bicard's advice... I sent four copies to the top four Parisian publishers.<eos> Sir, we regret to inform you... that your manuscript, which we read with interest and which has potential... has, however, not been retained by our committee.
Will Mr. Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?<eos> All passengers, please report for flight 614. Now departing.<eos> Flight leaves 6:45.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We missed the flight.<eos> - Miss Bianca, if you hadn't...<eos> - Come on. You worry too much.<eos> You know that flights are always late.<eos> Albatross flight 13 to tower. Albatross 13.<eos> Now, what did I tell you?
I'm sorry to come in just uninvited, but<eos> - the door was open. - I see, I would...<eos> I'd like to see you for some time.<eos> Fine.<eos> Do you mind if my wife goes?<eos> I might stand here. Understand she's not feeling very well.<eos> I understand, after that what happened.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - Sure.<eos> As I told you, I'm a novelist,
- Crime?<eos> - Especially crime, yes.<eos> And I heard of what happened to you,<eos> I came here and found the door open, so I thought I could wait for you here.<eos> You don't mind, do you?<eos> I see...<eos> No no, it's quite alright.<eos> I left in a hurry. And probably wasn't the last.<eos> Well, you might wonder what I want from you. It's just authors usually get incidents and events as fiction. It's a great help.<eos> So will you please tell me what happened to you and how it happened exactly?
Carry out the usual investigation and close the case...<eos> After all, it's not your daughter.<eos> Be more specific...<eos> You said it's a face you've seen somewhere.<eos> But where?<eos> Try to remember.<eos> There, in the quarter, definetely someone who lives there.<eos> Then you could identify him?<eos> - Sure, if I saw him again.<eos> I told you I saw him.
And after that it will be of no importance. Go on!<eos> Are you trying to scare me?<eos> Don't be so pessimistic.<eos> No, I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> What I said didn't come out right, please forgive me.<eos> I didn't mean to alarm you.<eos> And anyway, we won't be here talking about it for all eternity.<eos> Morel, you know that I find you very mysterious?<eos> There's no mystery.<eos> Don't take what I told you seriously.
It will turn out badly for you.<eos> - You see?<eos> - I see! Now shut up! - You're a monster!<eos> - Yes!<eos> I'll hang up if you continue ...<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, but that's the dream I had about you.<eos> Can't I finish telling you about it?<eos> Okay... if you can promise me it's a clean dream.<eos> I would censor my dreams if I could ...<eos> You can do what you want, but I forbid you from putting me in the middle of your delusions.
Who is?<eos> Mr. Starkey.<eos> - Do you have any...<eos> - Whatever you want... you'll have to get it from him.<eos> I have nothing more to say.<eos> Starkey.<eos> S-T...<eos> Mr. Starkey was very helpful.<eos> Four Cuban Americans and another man, James W. McCord.<eos> Look, I told you inside, I have nothing more to say.
Four Cuban Americans and another man, James W. McCord.<eos> Look, I told you inside, I have nothing more to say.<eos> I understand that.<eos> What I don't understand is how you got here.<eos> I assure you there's nothing very mysterious involved.<eos> Well, a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of the lawyers... assigned to represent the burglars.<eos> So?<eos> They never would have been assigned to represent the burglars... had anyone known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel.<eos> Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged for their own counsel... since they never even made a phone call.<eos> So, if no one asked you to be here, why are you here?
- This is Bob Woodward... of the Washington Post.<eos> Sorry to bother you at home.<eos> I was wondering if you could confirm some information... on one of your employees, Mr. Howard Hunt?<eos> What kind of information?<eos> It's just profile information mostly.<eos> We know, for example, that he works for Mullen Company... or did work for Mullen Company as a writer. He's also a novelist.<eos> We know that he works in the office of Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.<eos> And the CIA.<eos> And the CIA.<eos> If you're conducting that kind of investigation... then certainly it comes as no surprise to you that Howard was with the CIA.
What would you like?<eos> Oh, a double shot of anything.<eos> A spot of that sherry might be nice.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, tell me what you remember of the séance.<eos> In a nutshell?<eos> Please.<eos> About 40 years ago, you arranged to have your sister Harriet's baby given away without a trace.<eos> And now, your bad dreams and a troubled conscience tell you to find the grown-up person, take him into the family, and bestow your wealth on him.
Holy Christ, Blanche.<eos> No, George, not him.<eos> Bishop Wood at St. Anselm's Cathedral.<eos> He was a parson once, and he baptized the Shoebridge baby.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you know how I could make a date to see Bishop Wood?<eos> If you want to make the appointment today, you'll have to make it through the chaplain.<eos> Which one is the chaplain?<eos> When the service is over, I'll show you where to go.
We better get the police.<eos> And lose our $10,000?<eos> May I be of some help to you, madam?<eos> I'd like to see some bracelets.<eos> Any particular kind?<eos> Do you have anything with turquoise or perhaps pearls?<eos> Yes, please be seated.<eos> Anything wrong with our houseguest? He's fine.<eos> I gave him a very nice lunch and a fresh bottle of wine.<eos> Maybe one of these will appeal to you?
I've waited for you.<eos> I was faithful to you.<eos> It's been so long.<eos> - You know each other?<eos> - Never saw this man before in my life.<eos> Seriously, Mr. Prince, a first-class script.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> That's why I asked you to come right away.
- Others.<eos> - Uh, others to live.<eos> Then it wouldn't happen again.<eos> But as long as they're greedy... and as long as they're rushing the coal miner... in wanting the production before lives... there'll always be tragedies.<eos> I knowed there was somethin' wrong, but I didn't know what it was.<eos> - And the doctors told me.<eos> - 'Bout 60, don't you guess?<eos> Yeah, 'bout 60.<eos> Somewheres along there.<eos> Well, what would happen to you... when you started realizing that something was wrong?
- Very well.<eos> Soon, it will be Reza's turn.<eos> Soon, he'll be wearing a wedding suit.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> God bless the happiness of all young people!<eos> May they all fulfill their dreams!<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Sorry. May I take a look at the pants?<eos> I told you that he could try them on.
- On the floor above.<eos> Could I speak to Monsieur Zy?<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> - Have you seen the apartment?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I wanted to discuss the terms.<eos> 5,000 premium, 600 a month.<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> I couldn't pay more than 4,000.<eos> - The concierge told you about the water.
What kind of questions?<eos> Our readers want to know who you are.<eos> Why you, a millionairess, live alone, as a recluse from the outside world.<eos> That is of no one's concern.<eos> It is of ours, because you are an emancipated woman.<eos> And because our readers know that you prefer lesbian love.<eos> And that you have succeeded in barring male influence from your life.<eos> Also the rumours about your mystery are of great interest.<eos> Your life is said to be linked to a great secret.<eos> Apparently, there exists a woman who has a striking resemblance to you and who is, even more than you, secluded from the rest of the world.
Well, you have been very, very lucky, you know.<eos> Yes, I know. Poor Cato will be in the hospital for weeks.<eos> Do you know what kind of a bomb it was?<eos> The exploding kind.<eos> Mark my words, Francois.<eos> Sinister forces are at work, and this mad bomber must be apprehended at all costs.<eos> Make sure you issue an all-points bulletin immediately.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - What about my clothes?<eos> Sergeant Chauvin is rounding some up for you.
Now we are getting somewhere.<eos> You... oh, dear! Are you all right, Mr. Stutterstutt?<eos> - Who is this man?<eos> - He's Mr. Stutterstutt.<eos> What is your job, Mr. Stuckerstuff?<eos> He's the beekeeper.<eos> I'm not asking you.<eos> I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.<eos> What's that?<eos> What is he saying to you?
When Charles Nickers arrives you will give him the proper signal as you have been told to do, and you will continue to do so twice a day until I relieve you of the responsibility. If you do as I say, you will emerge from this dismal matter unharmed, as will your brother.<eos> Fail me in any respect, and you will held accountable for the death of Scott Adler.<eos> Oh, mon dieu! Yes, if I were French I would have said the same thing myself.<eos> See if he's there.<eos> Well?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then give the proper signal!<eos> He has gone.<eos> Here is my key. I am in room seventeen It's three doors down from you, across the corridor.<eos> Back to your room, Mademoiselle. And remember, do exactly as I told you. The boy's life depends on it.
- You ignorant nigger! Who you callin' nigger, huh? You don't know me well enough to call me no nigger!<eos> I'll slap the taste out your mouth! You don't even know my name! I'll whoop your ass!<eos> Beat the white of your ass. - Who are you?<eos> - I'm a thief.<eos> It's all right, Hilly.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> - Hi. - So this is Mr. Big. - That's the man.<eos> You ain't sayin' shit now, Mr. Big.<eos> I must admit that I'm slightly at a loss for words.<eos> But on the other hand, I should warn you... that you are a killer... and you are wanted by the police in every state... and I recommend that you, uh, be careful.
(as Peggy) I SEE ONE EYE AND--AND ANOTHER ONE<eos> MMM-HMM.<eos> NOW, TELL ME WHEN YOU SEE MY FINGERS WIGGLE.<eos> I SEE- - I SEE A PICTURE FRAME AND A... THERE'S A DOCTOR, A LADY, IS IN IT.<eos> OH, YEAH. YOU SEE A CIRCLE, RIGHT?<eos> THERE'S A CIRCLE, AND IT'S DARK ON THE SIDES OF IT.<eos> I SEE A WHITE COAT.<eos> IT'S A WHITE COAT.<eos> WHAT'S THE MATTER?<eos> DOES MY WHITE COAT BOTHER YOU?
SYBIL.<eos> SYBIL!<eos> SYBIL!<eos> SYBIL!<eos> NOW, TELL ME WHEN YOU SEE MY FINGERS WIGGLE.<eos> THE DEVIL HATH POWER TO ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE.<eos> I'VE CUT MY WRIST.<eos> YOU KNOW HOW OUR CHURCH FEELS ABOUT THE PRACTITIONERS OF THE MIND.<eos> WHAT'S THE MATTER?<eos> MY WHITE COAT BOTHER YOU?
Put the meter back on.<eos> Put it down.<eos> That's right.<eos> Put it down!<eos> That's right.<eos> Why are you writing?<eos> Don't write!<eos> Put the thing down.<eos> Just sit.<eos> I didn't tell you to write.
A Deleuze-Guattari re-written by Fornari.<eos> This uneasiness, that expresses itself in an atrocious detachment of bodies, in an infantile atrophy of gestures, it's a dialectical given:<eos> The body is unwell because it is healthy.<eos> It's that kind of dialectical reading that's missing, if I may, even in our Marxist tradition.<eos> Re-reading "Das Kapital", it seemed a bit kitsch.<eos> But in my opinion, the problem is another one.<eos> Why do you want to do theater?<eos> To get rich?<eos> To become famous?<eos> Because this medium of expression interests you.
I'm sorry I didn't guess that you'd suddenly done that after 12 years, dear.<eos> I'm afraid my psychic powers must be a little bit below par this morning.<eos> There we are.<eos> Don't be silly, Basil.<eos> It's written there quite clearly on the top of the box.<eos> "Pens?" Looks more like "Ben's" to me.<eos> Well, when Ben comes you can give it to him.<eos> Mr Walt's in room seven.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Doesn't that look like "Ben's" to you?
Indeed we do, yes.<eos> It is not in absolutely mint condition, but it could certainly be used in an emergency.<eos> It is to be found in the south wing, over-looking the courtyard, where there is, of course, ample parking.<eos> Ah, Polly.<eos> Mr Hutchinson, may I introduce Polly Sherman, who is with us at the moment?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> We've met before, I think.<eos> - Yes, I served you at breakfast.
- Can it wait?<eos> - Wait?<eos> A little longer, at least.<eos> In three days, we' ll be out of range.<eos> Every hour that passes lessens our chance of finding a decent home.<eos> There are 300 lives, Helena.<eos> Can you or I deny them that chance?<eos> All right.<eos> That's the maximum, sir. I can't give him any more.<eos> I'm Commander Koenig. I've got to speak to you.
I'll make sure of that.<eos> Oh, the beginnings will be small.<eos> But as we grow stronger, we'll spread out, expand.<eos> That's how the old feudal barons operated, wasn't it?<eos> Perhaps. But it's the way that ultimately led to the finest democratic system in the world.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It's just that I hadn't seen a political system as being one of our priorities.<eos> Well, that's where you're wrong.<eos> There's little groups forming already, trying to take over.<eos> I told you earlier we'd had a spot of trouble.
- You're joking, of course.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're going to kill me, as well?<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> Is there anything I can do that will make you change your mind?<eos> Well, there's nothing that I can think of.<eos> Supposing that I thought of something.<eos> - Hmm. For instance?<eos> - Well...<eos> For instance, supposing I told you that your fly was undone?
Fire!<eos> - Grossman.<eos> - That's the third today.<eos> They're recovering their losses from bankruptcies.<eos> - Do they have any other way out?<eos> - How much did they lose?<eos> About 200,000.<eos> I called the factory, but you had already left.<eos> What a pity.<eos> I even wrote to you myself.
- Where'?<eos> - You didn't pay me for this!<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Stop, you bastard!<eos> - Let go! Let go!<eos> For trying to escape.<eos> For underestimating me.<eos> You need companionship.<eos> You will learn.<eos> Yeah, what did I tell you?
- Sonny, what the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm burning the register here.<eos> Moving right along, folks.<eos> All right.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> Let me have the keys.<eos> Howard, give him the keys.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Howard.<eos> Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Murphy will report from the car.<eos> You make the report.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Back off.<eos> Get up now, Sonny.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You have the right to an attorney during your interrogation.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer ... one will be appointed to represent you if you wish one.
Well, if you start me, it'll all come back.<eos> Remember that? Yes.<eos> That was just like kissing, right?<eos> You're the greatest lover I've ever had.<eos> Well, I practice a lot when I'm alone.<eos> Shall we say pistols at dawn?<eos> Well, we can say it. I don't know what it means, but we can say it.<eos> You have insulted the honor of Countess Alexandrovna.<eos> Why? I let her finish first.<eos> - Her seconds will call on you.
- Is there time?<eos> - Very little.<eos> My spies tell me that my illustrious British enemy is working on a new meat recipe which he plans to call Beef Wellington.<eos> It will never get off the ground.<eos> We must develop the Napoleon before he develops Beef Wellington.<eos> The future of Europe hangs in the balance.<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> We must see you, Your Highness.<eos> We have reason to believe that there is a plot to take your life.<eos> That's why we've made up an obscure private from the ranks to look like you. - Look.
Perhaps he had troubles.<eos> He just bottled it all up.<eos> He was such a kind-hearted man.<eos> He didn't do it for himself. He did it for the others... who were in the same situation.<eos> For those... who would have been laid off, too.<eos> He was too good for this world.<eos> That's what Max said, his foreman.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> We'll show them!<eos> A shot of you at the factory gate. What do you say?
That is not the kind of walker I had in mind.<eos> - That's very fast.<eos> - We have to be.<eos> She had this most horrible accident.<eos> - Hi, Marie. How are you?<eos> - How are you?<eos> And she got a lick on the head gettin' into a car... one of those tiny cars, her daughter's car.<eos> This happened almost a year ago.<eos> No one had any idea this was gonna develop into such a horrible thing.<eos> Mr., uh, Triplette... I'm real sorry ole Delbert told you... Haven would appear at the political rally.
We'll try it one more time. Everyone take their places...<eos> Third act from the oath scene.<eos> You can stand here...<eos> Please don't spit!<eos> It has to do with an electric fireplace that I want to do at home.<eos> Is it old or new?<eos> It's new...<eos> The problem is that there are three leads... and I don't know which ones go where.<eos> If you don't have the power I can't make the connection.<eos> That's why I came to you... so you would come to my home and check it out and let me know if it will work.
Well, I've been in so many places the last few years it doesn't make any difference anymore.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Don't you think so?<eos> Beautiful?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So still.<eos> A kind of waiting.<eos> You seem unusually poetic for a businessman.<eos> Do I?<eos> Doesn't the desert have the same affect on you?
Did you know that?<eos> With this.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> The brain is a dangerous tool.<eos> Indeed. But it's essential.<eos> Without it, there would be no love either.<eos> Sensuality, eroticism...<eos> I'll give you an example.<eos> What's more sexy to you?<eos> A woman stripping in front of you or another who lets herself be spied through an open window or a keyhole?
You got it all right.<eos> Now, stop talking and hold still.<eos> Alright?<eos> Alright.<eos> What's this story about Napo and Paola's illness?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Napo gave me a hand with treating the girl in your absence.<eos> That's all.<eos> From now on, I'll appreciate you taking only the tasks assigned to you.
Thank you. Good bye.<eos> Stop!<eos> Documents!<eos> It is forbidden to go out during the curfew.<eos> Do you have a safe-conduct?<eos> Please excuse us, Doctor.<eos> I was worried, mister Julien.<eos> Everything's fine, Jeanne.<eos> - I hope they didn't wait for me?<eos> - No, but I kept a dish for you.
Mrs. Van Niekirk, your friend Shack, I'm surprised he's not in the bath.<eos> I mean, he's shared your spoons and your sheets, hasn't he?<eos> Nice Afrikaner girl like you.<eos> Now, why should you be in a bathtub with a foreigner instead of your husband?<eos> You tell me why, I'm interested.<eos> I'm interested in seeing your search warrant.<eos> Show her, then.<eos> Where are the diamonds?<eos> Major Horn means the diamonds to finance Wilby Xaba's black revolution.<eos> It's probably pointless but I ask you to believe that I know nothing about any diamonds.
Seven prostitutes, 3 slackers and a young man called Lello Riviera.<eos> Why are telling me that, Mr Santamaria?<eos> - Try to make a guess.<eos> The exquisite tact of our cops.<eos> Last night, he was at your place.<eos> - The tact is cast off.<eos> Hasn't Mr Riviera already told you that he dined here?<eos> He made no such statement.<eos> A very reserved person. A real gentleman.<eos> What do you mean? If he hasn't told you, how do you know that we're friends?
Why is it that the bad washerwoman never finds a pretty pear?<eos> What's a washerwoman got to do with pears?<eos> - In Turinese, a "pear" is a "stone".<eos> There!<eos> - The bad washerwoman, never finds a good stone.<eos> Because, since she's bad, she has no intention of doing... any washing.<eos> In English you say... - We don't care.<eos> The Piedmontese is enough.<eos> Mr Bonetto... - Tell me!<eos> That night, Garrone told you:
- I gotta go.<eos> See you.<eos> - See you.<eos> Mistress. I'm thirsty.<eos> I don't deserve it.<eos> You just want to tempt me.<eos> Sometimes you have no pity.<eos> Punish me, but I beg you, not too hard. It hurts. - Really?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Did she tell you to come?
I don't deserve it.<eos> You just want to tempt me.<eos> Sometimes you have no pity.<eos> Punish me, but I beg you, not too hard. It hurts. - Really?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Did she tell you to come?<eos> She's capable of anything.<eos> - Like what?<eos> What does she do to you?<eos> Answer me or I'll really hurt you.
-I can try...<eos> It's a story about a virtuous woman...<eos> Who had never made love before.<eos> So, on the first night...<eos> Together with her husband...<eos> She's so scared she ends up stone dead...<eos> And the woman dies virtuously.<eos> Without ever knowing what it's like to make love.<eos> It means whoever says they're morally right is talking crap.<eos> It was Giorgio who told you he didn't want to be treated like a boy, right?
The most brilliant surgeon in europe stuck that tail on.<eos> What about the head?<eos> All of the head was removed Apart from the eyes and the brain In order to fit into the costume.<eos> That's incredible!<eos> Do you want to talk to him?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Let's move over to those trees over there.<eos> Anyone might be watching.<eos> Mr. salad<eos> There's a mr. carpenter to see you.
Yes, you know f.o.c.-- Free of charge.<eos> Well, my husband ken--<eos> K.e.n.-- he said...<eos> Oh, forget about your husband, mrs. s.c.u.m.<eos> Or may I call you "mrs. s.?"<eos> You can call me "linda" if you like.<eos> No, I'd rather call you "mrs. s."<eos> Oh. And you can call me "mr. n."<eos> Well, that's what I was calling you.<eos> Mrs. s., there is something I have to tell you.
Please take the funt5,000!<eos> I was thinking if we got married...<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> We could use the funt 5,000 to buy a spoon.<eos> Oh, we could buy a lot more than that.<eos> And then fill up with ice cream.<eos> Oh, forget about the ice cream;<eos> We need the money.<eos> We need nothing, for there is something<eos> I have not told you, mrs. s.c.u.m.
Hippocratic...<eos> Oh, it's not in there.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> Very useful.<eos> Yes, you must be Mr. Williams, is that so?<eos> Well, do take a seat.<eos> What seems to be the trouble?<eos> I've just been stabbed by your nurse!<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Yes, well, I probably better have a look at you then.
Nothing's happening.<eos> OK, honey.<eos> Try it to the left.<eos> Slowly.<eos> It's not working.<eos> There's nothing happening.<eos> It... it's not turning the plane.<eos> Jesus, it's not working for turns.<eos> Can't you tell us what's happening?<eos> They want us to change course, just like I told you.
Marie, bring us two Scotch, rocks.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You trying to ruin my afternoon trade?<eos> - No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You act like it.<eos> Here, swig on this and troubles will vanish.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See?<eos> What did I tell you?
- Well, sir...<eos> I'm not surprised he got away from those bloody fools in Ml5.<eos> Judging by the hour, he eluded your efforts too.<eos> - We'll catch him, sir.<eos> - Will you? !<eos> - Do you know where he's gone?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> No, of course you don't.<eos> But I do.<eos> Well, Miss Burrows, Paris has certainly done things for you.
Just a moment, please.<eos> Cedric, it's for you.<eos> I think his name is Scrabble.<eos> - Harper here.<eos> - Drabble speaking.<eos> Tarrant is back in England.<eos> We must move fast.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> You're not the man I spoke to earlier.<eos> I told you before, there's more than one Drabble.
Maid's night off?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because nobody's here, that's why.<eos> I gave everyone the night off.<eos> - Easy, it's an innocent question.<eos> - No question from you is innocent.<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> To you, Mrs Mulwray.<eos> Frankly, tonight you saved my a... you saved my neck.<eos> Tell me, Mr Gittes, does this often happen to you?
You may smoke... discreetly<eos> The children are being very noisy<eos> Is "white elephant" back?<eos> No, he's on a trip to Australia<eos> Have "Naive Larks"... ..and "Ladies of FIajolie" gone?<eos> Like "Spiders in the Night"<eos> "Death with a blue Ribbon"<eos> "Before the Mirror"?<eos> "Before the Mirror"... 1 1th July...<eos> Madame Michelle, I told you not to let your cats stray!
-No.<eos> -Is the wounded man the vigilante? -He's just a mugging victim.<eos> -What about reports that he is?<eos> -False reports.<eos> -Then he's still out there.<eos> -That's right.<eos> Mr. Kersey. Fred Brown.<eos> Welcome to Chicago.<eos> -Nice trip? -It was okay.<eos> I found a nice apartment for you on Lakeshore Drive a view of Lake Michigan.
-By no means. Trippelli can't sing the whole week.<eos> It would be too much for her and for us.<eos> Variety is the spice of life... a truth... that every happy marriage would seem to refute.<eos> If there is such a thing as a happy marriage, mine excepted.<eos> How about hunting seals next time?<eos> That's not possible.<eos> The harbour police.<eos> When I hear things like that! Does everything have to be so legal?<eos> Legality is boring.<eos> Crampas, that's typical of you... and Effi applauds you.
My lawyer Tom Hagen.<eos> Senator Geary.<eos> He arranged everything through your man Turnbull.<eos> -Yes, yes.<eos> -Sit down.<eos> I thought that you and I would talk alone.<eos> I trust these men with my life, Senator.<eos> To ask them to leave would be an insult.<eos> Well, it's perfectly all right with me but I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you.<eos> Maybe more frankly than anyone in my position has ever talked to you before.
Mister Crewe, what do you think of semi-pro ball?<eos> Semi-pro's a joke.<eos> Well, perhaps we could use a few pointers from the big leagues.<eos> Captain, what do you say to Mister Crewe here looking in, giving us the benefit of his invaluable knowledge?<eos> That's a real good idea, Warden.<eos> We could use all the help we can get.<eos> Well?<eos> I haven't held a football in eight years.<eos> I'm not in very good shape.<eos> Nobody's asked you to play, Mister Crewe.
They finally dragged him off to the funny farm, but by the time he was cured, there was no career left for him.<eos> You don't live down the kind of headlines he was getting in the newspapers.<eos> "Sex actress murdered.<eos> Dr. Death accused."<eos> "Dr. Death acquitted."<eos> "Dr. Death retires."<eos> Perhaps he didn't do it.<eos> He killed her, all right.<eos> Oliver, I'm in public relations. Not criminal aftercare.<eos> All I'm asking you to do is collect him off the ship and make sure you get his pictures in the papers.
We'll use a model speech with variations, native son here, farmer's boy there, technical director here, family man there.<eos> You can also stress the fact - how could I say - that Chamoret is a non political candidate.<eos> He's not a party man, just an ordinary man interested in public affairs, not politicking.<eos> "A slogan: ""If you are not" "interested in politics, vote for him!"""<eos> I'll let you lock up.<eos> Remember the back door.<eos> You sent for me?<eos> Yes. Take a seat.<eos> Chamoret.<eos> Here is my text for you on economic problems.
Twelve.<eos> Mr McQueen, how many capital letters, each inscribed by a different hand, were contained in each of the two threatening messages you showed me in Ratchett's correspondence file?<eos> Er... er... 12. 12.<eos> Colonel Arbuthnot, how many persons in a jury?<eos> Twelve.<eos> Pierre Paul Michel, how many passengers in the Calais coach, excluding myself and the murdered man?<eos> Twelve, monsieur.<eos> - Show me your wallet. - No!<eos> Votre portefeuille. Mr Hardman, you may not speak.<eos> Ratchett never asked you to be his bodyguard, he asked me. And I, perhaps to my discredit, refused.
- Monte Cassino?<eos> Monte Cassino has been destroyed by the new barbarians the Americans.<eos> The British and the Polish have reduced it to rubble.<eos> Not even a saint could live there, now.<eos> May I ask how you intend to save Milan from a similar destruction?<eos> From that useless slaughter you were unable to spare the rest of Italy?<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - A drink?<eos> No, no...<eos> Do you plan to accept the capitulation which will be offered to you today?
I've always fought against the king and traitors who wanted to disrupt my revolution!<eos> Gentlemen, please excuse me...<eos> In these days I've enacted a decree with which I intend to give all my power to the people.<eos> The decree provides for the nationalization of factories and the transfer of my powers to the Socialist Party.<eos> This is my commitment.<eos> I still haven't received an answer to this proposal...<eos> I am now waiting.<eos> Mister Mussolini.<eos> Your proposal is pointless.<eos> You give away things, that don't belong to you anymore.
Yes.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Now, coffee and a walk.<eos> I've got to relieve Buenaventura.<eos> What an old fart!<eos> I'm gonna have a dreadful affair, I can tell!<eos> Sit down, Goémond.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Speak up!<eos> We found the Simca used for the kidnapping in a Champs-Elysées parking lot, as I told you.
He comes but less often.<eos> When'd you see him last?<eos> Early last week... Tuesday.<eos> No, Monday night.<eos> They had a row.<eos> A row?<eos> I mean, he and Diaz did.<eos> In Diaz' room, I mean. They exchanged insults.<eos> I was upstairs 'cause the john was plugged.<eos> I won't bother you with that.
You're almost psychotic!<eos> I recall your very words.<eos> "l'd put'em to the wall."<eos> I don't recall yours, but I understood you.<eos> I'm not interested in your imaginings!<eos> So I'm the scapegoat.<eos> Don't use that absurd word in public, I'll be grateful.<eos> How grateful?<eos> Disciplinary action will be necessary.<eos> But... a little travel won't hurt you.
Goodbye.<eos> Your tumour seems to have improved.<eos> I don't have much pain now, sir.<eos> You'll need a new identity.<eos> And a new passport.<eos> I'm sending you to one of our people in Bayreuth.<eos> His name is Klaus Wenzer.<eos> He's a specialist at this kind of thing.<eos> Probably the best.<eos> After he's fixed you up with documents he'll pass you on to someone who'll tell you what to do next.
I know.<eos> Good shot.<eos> Good shot. You got a point.<eos> Not bad, Riggsy.<eos> - That's good. Hey, babe, you're all right. - Winning, huh?<eos> Winning?<eos> I'm beating the shit out of him.<eos> I'm Schwartzkopf, this is Riggs.<eos> Harry Nelson.<eos> The Psych department gave those vocational tests to you?
- Her granddaughter.<eos> - Her granddaughter.<eos> - And this gentleman?<eos> - He's my husband.<eos> Your husband at such a young age?<eos> I see you're doing some painting here.<eos> You see as far as I know you aren't registered here.<eos> So?<eos> And as far as I know you are at your grandmother's every day.<eos> Who informed you about my living here?
Who will fight with me?<eos> You'd all rather stick to the old beliefs, watch us get cut down and dragged away until there's nobody left?<eos> I'll fight.<eos> No, Veta.<eos> You know the Creator's will.<eos> And I also know I don't want to die.<eos> Or be a slave.<eos> Do you?<eos> You Lot will stay here with me and Kahlan.<eos> Roga, will you let Zedd and Cara go with you to the caves, and protect you until these people are ready to protect you themselves?
Traffic is light, there is no rain, it is three lanes, but you're forced to do 50.<eos> I don't know who the Minister of Transport is, but I want him to find the man who came up with that idea, go round to his office on Monday morning, and punch him really hard on the side of his head.<eos> Because if he doesn't, I'm going to find the man and attach him to a milling machine, and I'm gonna see if it is possible to turn a man's head into a perfect cube.<eos> Do you know why they have the 50mph speed limit? To protect the work force, who weren't there.<eos> They were in bed, where I wanted to be.<eos> But the answer is not cubing people's heads, the answer is when the work force isn't there, do 70.<eos> Well you gonna just get nicked?<eos> No, but if everybody does 70.<eos> Who here would just do 70 through a set of road works with an average speed cameras?<eos> Nobody James. If you go charging through you just gonna get booked.
Please tell me.<eos> Choi Seung Hee!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Hey, Choi Seung Hee!<eos> Hurry and open the door!<eos> Choi Seung Hee!<eos> Aren't you going to open the door?<eos> I think I'll have to stop here.<eos> Hey, Choi Seung Hee!<eos> Now those people will interrogate you.
Jackpot!<eos> Mi Nyu!<eos> Why did you take so long to contact me?<eos> I've been well.<eos> I'm glad that I can see Mi Nam's concert with you!<eos> Auntie, I don't have too much time so I don't think I can see all of the concert.<eos> I'll probably leave after saying hi to Oppa.<eos> You don't have time?<eos> Mi Nyu, the people that want to see you are lined up!<eos> Snail and Kang Goon keep on asking about you and want to see you.
- Okay, good.<eos> No, I need to get down there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you check out some flights and see what's available?<eos> Amy!<eos> Dad?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean, what am I doing here?<eos> Everybody didn't show up for the visit.<eos> So I said, "If you don't come to me, I'm gonna go to you."
When you fell from Heaven, they laughed at you, Nathaniel.<eos> You're my heart, Nathaniel.<eos> I do love you, Nathaniel.<eos> We'll be together forever, Nathaniel.<eos> I'll protect you.<eos> Look, I'II be here to protect you from the pain.<eos> -l'll be here to protect you from the pain.<eos> -Fibber. You fibber.<eos> You fib.<eos> I'll protect you from the noise.
-No, I do not think so.<eos> Hell, Satan...<eos> What the hell do I do?<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -You must go home - now.<eos> -Who the hell are you?<eos> "I am not.<eos> "I just work there.<eos> -All this shit is totally sick!<eos> "They will kill you.
- But you're not gonna take them<eos> - to heaven with you, are you?<eos> - I'm gonna go in the Rapture, and I'm gonna come back on a white horse.<eos> So you think Jesus will end this earth at some point, maybe in your lifetime?<eos> One always hopes.<eos> This is a sign, and that is a sign.<eos> If a nuclear bomb went off, and it seemed like that was exactly what it had said, balls of fire or something, you wouldn't look on that as necessarily a bad thing.<eos> I know I'll be with God.<eos> This is why rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves.<eos> And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price.
Not conversely.<eos> - We heard, Hoffmann comes here.<eos> - The Gestapo-boss?<eos> - That is what I have to not be able to say.<eos> - I'd like to talk with him.<eos> Rumour has it that he also had to be enormously nice...<eos> - And murderer for an occupying power.<eos> - Yes, also it.<eos> - You like them?<eos> - You?
- There's no other way out of here.<eos> How about now?<eos> Yeah, "now" works for me.<eos> Commander, we have them trapped.<eos> Vala, it's Tomin.<eos> Put down your weapons and surrender, and I promise you'll all be spared.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I was just about to say the same thing!<eos> Vala, you have to trust me.<eos> Your position has been targeted from space. Comply now or you will be destroyed!
You tried to convince yourself that the people you were hurting deserved it.<eos> You became numb to their pain and suffering.<eos> You learned to shut out the voice speaking against it.<eos> There's always a choice.<eos> - Indeed, there he is.<eos> - I chose to ignore it.<eos> Yet you sit here now.<eos> I sit here, and I cannot imagine the day when I will forgive myself.<eos> Because it will never come.<eos> One day, others may try to convince you they have forgiven you.
But I don't think it's you that's gonna do it.<eos> I would not be so sure.<eos> Really?<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Earth has to be the most densely populated planet in the galaxy. What are you waiting for?<eos> Sure you've tried to... warn us a couple of times, but come on, you can do better than that, can't you?<eos> We've been a tremendous pain in your proverbial backside.<eos> You don't really expect me to believe that you... you've just been saving the best for last, do you?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You guys are never speechless.
You guys are never speechless.<eos> I'll tell you what I think.<eos> I say this move reeks of desperation.<eos> You're not all that sure to slam-dunk.<eos> Your defenses are no match for the might of the Ori which shall rain down Apocalypse upon...<eos> Right, right, here's a news flash.<eos> The Ori are dead.<eos> We killed them.<eos> Sent a weapon devised by a ex-Ancient through the Supergate, and wiped them all out.<eos> These beings you call gods, the ones who lied to you, manipulated you, for their own selfish power-hungry reasons are gone.
- Why?<eos> He was trying to erase shit when we tackled him.<eos> Secure this location until we have written search-and-seizure.<eos> Shit's on TV, yo.<eos> With a street value of almost sixteen million dollars in heroin, and charges against high-level traffickers who were going to put this poison on the streets of this city...<eos> Do this mean I still gotta take that charge for y'all?<eos> ...and perseverance by our police department.<eos> And while I am told that this investigation is continuing, it is my understanding that there is at least one murder warrant associated with this drug organization, which is believed to have been responsible for many of those bodies found in vacant rowhouses more than a year ago.<eos> We did not give up on that investigation just as we do not give up trying every day to address ourselves to the task of making this city safe and vibrant again.<eos> Let me just say to all others responsible for the drug trade's assault on the welfare of this city, a day like this is coming for you.
Let`s go join the party.<eos> Jackie, get up.<eos> Wheeeee!<eos> If you don`t get up, l`m leaving you here.<eos> What is it Har?<eos> If we keep going, we won`t hear him.<eos> Look, you guys keep going.<eos> l`m gonna stay here and relay.<eos> What are you doing Babe? Go with them.<eos> l`m not leaving you.
Andrew Blauner?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?<eos> Any deliveries scheduled for today?<eos> I'm giving you one more...<eos> What is all this?<eos> You okay?<eos> They told me not to talk to you.
Oh, to some people, but not to you<eos> No, you see, ifyou and I establish the business relationship I am anticipating you'II be happen to know exactly what to expect<eos> And what can I expect?<eos> Eighty per cent<eos> Now, you certainly know all the problems that arose when our beloved new deal was imposed in '65 the plantation owners had plenty of land but nobody to work it<eos> So they contracted with their former slaves But they just didn't have the same hold on the rascals as they had in the old days<eos> Of course, they lend them money Then quite a few of the nigras actually saved up and paid off their debts so the plantation owners got worried<eos> - I bet they did!<eos> - Oh, yes See, that is where my idea came in<eos> I went from plantation to plantation with the full backing of the plantation owners to entertain their employees, and they were sorely in need of diversion, Iet me tell you we just had a Iittle game of cards
In order to extend it, I have to slice it!<eos> No, doctor, please, I'm here for the granny.<eos> What granny?<eos> For a sex change?<eos> No... Look doctor.<eos> My granny Zumbula.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Did you notify the police?<eos> Sure I did.<eos> They referred me to you...
Through music, we overcome our grief... and enjoy a happy life.<eos> As the Bible says, "To each day, its own troubles".<eos> Are you from around here?<eos> No, I'm from the capital.<eos> I came because my husband bought a piece of land here... and my mother came with us.<eos> But he died.<eos> He had already died when my daughter was born.<eos> What was he looking for in the sand?<eos> My husband was crazy.<eos> What about you?
You okay?<eos> I never did anything to this bitch.<eos> That's right.<eos> Now she wants to sue all of us?<eos> You know what a class action is, don't you?<eos> It means it's all of them against all of us!<eos> That's right, this bitch wants to take every single swinging dick in this room to court.<eos> Now, the other women have shown us something here in the past few months.<eos> Telling the truth for a change.<eos> How about you?
We can get our McFlurry on.<eos> Enjoy it, fat man.<eos> What about the love of a beautiful woman?<eos> Well, you're gonna have to lower your standards on the beautiful part and on the woman part.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let's just stick with the cheeseburgers.<eos> Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months, he gonna look like Beyoncé.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Now, here's the most important part.<eos> You can't let these guys scare you.
Do I have a fucking gun?<eos> I can't hurt you. It's not fuckin' good enough, rat-bitch.<eos> Come on.Just lock him up, man, so he doesn't do any damage.<eos> Come on. Come on, Roenick. Listen to me, man.<eos> We're not locking'this man up. Not in my precinct, all right? I vouch for him.<eos> Okay, I'm fuckin' sorry, but your authority has been super-fuckin'-seded. You understand?<eos> Right, Bish?<eos> Bish, tell 'em.<eos> He could be one of them, man, so fuckin'easily.<eos> You don't think we see right through you?
- Sarge?<eos> Sergeant!<eos> Yeah, Iris.<eos> Shh. It's okay. I told these firemen.<eos> All right. Help me up.<eos> We have some questions for you, Sergeant.<eos> I'd like to get this wound looked at first.<eos> Anybody else out there?<eos> No, man. There's nobody else. Just me and-- and them.<eos> Let me get you on a stretcher.
- Feed the dog.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Any news from CHA?<eos> Well, I'm still... in the process of moving on it, sir.<eos> This is CHA's dauther.<eos> I got a better idea!<eos> What about using her!<eos> We could torture the hell out of her, then she'll talk.<eos> You are worse than the dogs.<eos> I should feed the dogs with you.
I don't know w ho 'Ashura' is but if you want me, you'll leave him alone.<eos> Move!<eos> You'd give your life for him?<eos> Yes!<eos> No, Tsubaki!<eos> You said we're opposites.<eos> How could I let you die here? !<eos> Waait!<eos> Nanboku... forgive our unseemly behavior.<eos> Take them with you.
Keep still!<eos> You're bleeding again!<eos> That's fine<eos> At least that blood won't rush to my head<eos> Don't be silly!<eos> I'm sorry I got you hurt<eos> Don't worry<eos> Tell me ...what am I?<eos> Am I ...a demon?<eos> Don't let them fool you
She wants to know if we are going today for Passover.<eos> Is it Passover already?<eos> Time really flies!<eos> Do you want me to order something from "Ciervo de Oro"? We'll stay home. —Okay.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> —Tell me if you don't want to.<eos> —I do, honey.<eos> —No, you don't.<eos> —Hear yourself.<eos> —I'm telling you to do it, honey.
Statistics show that the inmate population increases 30% every year.<eos> Telephone for you.<eos> What?<eos> For you!<eos> I'll be right there, dear.<eos> For your information, both new and old staff members,<eos> must comply with the rules, which I want to emphasize are 'iron' rules.<eos> Reading and chanting in any language is strictly prohibited.<eos> Food must not be given in granular form. No talking to the inmates.<eos> No inmates are allowed to touch you.
Again!<eos> You remember what I said before...<eos> Counting how many times he does that...<eos> (he's tallying how many times the teacher pulls up on his pants)<eos> Understand?<eos> OK the last one...<eos> Everyday is just a repeat of useless stuff.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> That was about.... people talk about stuff, and I want to say back...<eos> That has absolutely nothing to do with you!
You went undercover and infiltrated an aum shinrikyo terror cell.<eos> None of this means anything to you, does it? Of course not. Why should it?<eos> Well, your cover was compromised.<eos> They held you for three weeks.<eos> Sleep deprivation, torture... they'd have killed you if you didn't escape.<eos> So how does doherty fit in?<eos> Aum shinrikyo's been planning an attack on the u.s.<eos> Since they've been sneaking radioactive material into the country in museum pouches.<eos> He's been in bed with them all along.<eos> Tom, he sold you out.
Then the future picked the wrong man.<eos> He spent nine years becoming a doctor.<eos> What, am i supposed to get rid of him? Wish him away?<eos> It's not really kyle.<eos> Don't say that!<eos> If it's not kyle, who's moving around downstairs in the kitchen?<eos> Kyle. Shawn. Danny.<eos> None of them are real. They're just projections.<eos> You've spent eight years with these people.<eos> They're as real to you as they are to me.
Around you?<eos> You can.<eos> Mary O'Connell.<eos> Disappeared in 1972.<eos> Promising empath.<eos> Robert Fields, 1987.<eos> Genius with numbers and pattern recognition.<eos> -John Gersten.<eos> -Who are they? Alternates. Possibly.<eos> No one is as capable as you but I want to forward, with you or another.
You almost got us all killed.<eos> You too, mr.<eos> Dravitt.<eos> Well, it'll be interesting to see if your friend's impressions will stand up in court.<eos> I guess i'm the one should be more careful who i do business with.<eos> Shawn, you can come with us if you want.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll tell your mother you said hello.<eos> Gary, you should have come to me first.<eos> I'd have treated you better than they ever will.
Her father's Bronze Star.<eos> Ted won it in the first Gulf War, and he gave it to her for luck.<eos> Those people deserve the truth.<eos> Their daughter was murdered.<eos> They deserve the kindness of a lie.<eos> There will bean inquest report.<eos> Which they won't read because they don't want to.<eos> Especially because toward the end,<eos> Cleo and her parents weren't even speaking.<eos> They told you that?
Or I could just call you plain Nigger General.<eos> Call me just plain Nigger.<eos> Short Plains Nigger.<eos> Nigger of the High Desert.<eos> Thanks for the conversation, Miss Jane, and the whiskey.<eos> I am going blind as a fucking bat.<eos> Who is that, the fucking Sheriff?<eos> Flanked by some assholes?<eos> I feel no less manhandled by you, sir.<eos> If they still had you, by now you'd be feeling worse.
- Hi, Harry!<eos> - What are you smilin' about?<eos> I've been seein' A.J. for more than five months, Harry.<eos> You little hypocrite. I ever held you back once from doin' anything?<eos> What about having a life, Harry?<eos> The first time I got my period... Rockhound had to take me into Taipei for Tampax... and then he had to show me how to use 'em, Harry.<eos> I ju- - No, l-l told her how to use it. I didn't show her, Harry.<eos> I was playing with titanium depth gauges when I should've been playing with dolls.<eos> I mean, I learned about the birds and the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.<eos> Look, I was raised on roughnecks by you... and now you get all shocked and shaken when I fall in love with one.
The shuttle's ready to go, whenever you are.<eos> On my way.<eos> Captain, I've been thinking.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to take Lieutenant Tuvok with you, just in case the Rukani turn out to be less friendly than they seem?<eos> I assure you, Commander, I have made thorough preparations for the Captain's safety during her away mission.<eos> You, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as First Officer.<eos> Under the circumstances, I believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the Captain has placed in you.<eos> I appreciate your concern for my safety, Mr. Chakotay, but Tuvok's right.<eos> Lieutenant Paris and I will be just fine.<eos> I'II see you in 24 hours.
Son of a bacchae!<eos> Now, you're hiring mercenaries to do your killing.<eos> We don't need strangers to do a job we're glad to do ourselves.<eos> You realize, this means all-out war?<eos> I relish it.<eos> Sorry, boys, here's been a change of plan.<eos> Now, go home!<eos> All of you..., ...until you can play nice.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> Don't know you.
- They said, " If Cole don't obey--" - I'll break your fuckin' head!<eos> You hear me?<eos> Volunteers now boarding at gate 37.<eos> You see?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> These are my orders, man.<eos> Just take it.<eos> Take it!<eos> This part isn't about the virus at all, is it?<eos> It's about following orders, about doing what you're told.
My fucking back's killing me.<eos> I need a crap.<eos> - Do you want me to go in?<eos> - No, I'll go.<eos> Excuse me, sir, you can't park here.<eos> Are you staying at the hotel?<eos> Sorry, could you direct me to Marion Barber?<eos> We're the cabaret act from Sydney.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Reception will take you through.
Well? Any rings on fingers?<eos> Gareth, you don't know how lucky you are. Finding someone to marry is a tricky business.<eos> It's hell out there. Matthew's trapped with an evangelist from Minnesota.<eos> My lords, ladies, and gentlemen, please charge your glasses.<eos> First, and rather unusually, we have the bride.<eos> Excellent. I love this girl.<eos> Thank you.<eos> First of all, I'd like to thank all of you who've flown in from the States.<eos> As for the rest of you, I'd have thought that lots of frightful Americans flying in was an excuse for staying away.<eos> So I thank you, too.
Miz Kelty?<eos> Miz Kelty?<eos> You don't need me, Mr. Baring.<eos> Just wasting my time again<eos> You know where I am. No square dancing!<eos> Do you reckon he ought to be in the hospital?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> My advice is don't go near those places unless they pay you a heap of money
He's a total nightmare for women. I can't believe I haven't slept with him yet.<eos> Do you ever wish you were a lesbian?<eos> Don't you think it would be so much easier?<eos> Sometimes, but...<eos> I couldn't go through with it. I'd start laughing or something.<eos> But it's such a shame... because I am so through with men.<eos> If one more guy walks out on me... I don't even know what.<eos> I swear.<eos> What are you talking about...<eos> Walk out on you?
- Were they from the rebels?<eos> - They were.<eos> That's a breach of our agreement with the Paradan government.<eos> It's a reason to cancel these peace talks.<eos> That might be premature.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We've got more than enough...<eos> - They got to you.<eos> - Don't be ridiculous. I'm just...<eos> No, they got to you.
You think they'll elect you if you're a candidate?<eos> It'll be difficult, it's not yet clear.<eos> I'm not in a hurry and the situation is complicated.<eos> The party should find new people, if the right won't benefit from the situation, and luckily, the ecologists too.<eos> Luckily?<eos> At least, their votes will be for the left.<eos> But if they're reactionaries, they've never been for the left.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Yes. Me too.<eos> - The green will devour you.
Breakfast time.<eos> Out.<eos> You... you're Keith!<eos> Zenigata.<eos> Where's Goemon? Can't say where your friend is, huh?<eos> No!<eos> I can explain...<eos> Drop your Zantetsuken.<eos> You don't want anything to happen to this woman, do you?<eos> There's no need for me to arrest you and drag you back to the ICPO.
You can read my novel.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Oh, that's great!<eos> Thanks.<eos> - You have to go easy on it because...<eos> - Oh, of course.<eos> - Wanna come up?<eos> - Now?<eos> Meet my parents.<eos> They're so in love with you.
Call judge. Say to come here.<eos> Call.<eos> I'm glad I met you.<eos> Glad I could feel my heart still beating .<eos> And even batter. When you see it.<eos> Finally, this country that hate gave me someone so... sweet.<eos> No!<eos> Stay here.<eos> Go get them.<eos> I told you to go Take them!
Francesca.<eos> And how old is he?<eos> Little, tiny.<eos> Can only say a few words.<eos> Told me to kill that talk.<eos> I do not know anything about the photos.<eos> Nothing...<eos> Bellini did not say anything.<eos> But he did not believed.<eos> I thought that if I I die, that I will convince you, maybe... Francesca release it.
HIS VICTIMS- THEY'VE GOT NOTHING IN COMMON,<eos> APART FROM THE FACT THEY'RE ALL MEN.<eos> THAT'S PURE COINCIDENCE, REALLY.<eos> I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT HIS NEXT VICTIM.<eos> INTERESTED?<eos> YOU OUGHT TO BE... BECAUSE THE NEXT ONE'S GOING TO BE A WOMAN.<eos> I MEAN, WHAT SETS HIM OFF?<eos> THAT'S WHAT I KEEP THINKING ABOUT.<eos> IT COULD BE THIS CITY THAT DOES IT,<eos> LIVING IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS TO SO MANY STRANGERS, PEOPLE YOU HATE, ALL OF THEM WANTING TO HURT YOU
It won't do any harm.<eos> I beg you to do something.<eos> You're trying to seduce me!<eos> You monster!<eos> Oh, come, come. I'll tell everyone about you. I'll tell my husband.<eos> Leave your poor husband out of this.<eos> Don't you think I can tell him a thing or two?<eos> I know it's not funny. But debts never killed anyone.<eos> When one has friends, like you... Where can I find the money?<eos> You have friends, I tell you...
It's where the monsters go.<eos> It takes away the pain.<eos> Hey, wait a minute...<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> They forgive you there.<eos> See, they only take you if you're worthy.<eos> You know what they do to those that... aren't worthy?<eos> So you know where it is?<eos> You and I could go there.<eos> - They sent you.
It's a battle. Us against them.<eos> The last battle.<eos> The final stage.<eos> The house was constructed over the stake, wasn't it?<eos> Only the church can cure the church. Only the faith can cancel the errors.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Peter is still there with George.<eos> - George...<eos> - You've got to go help them. I can only pray for them.<eos> But I'm leaving her with you.
So Burdock, don't you think you went over the top there, even celebrating your son's birth and all?<eos> Celebrating my son's birth?<eos> What a ridiculous farce!<eos> We're finished on this planet. Why don't you head back to Planet Vegeta and meet him?<eos> To see a lowest-class warrior without any promise at all?<eos> What kind of fool would make that trip? And who asked you what I should be doing anyhow?<eos> I see.<eos> We ought to be grateful to Freeza-sama. He's been putting us to work for him quite often.<eos> So what does Freeza-sama want with a crummy little planet like this?<eos> You know why I heard? This Kanassa is supposed to have some kind of energy that grants you psychic abilities.
Have they treated you well?<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Except...<eos> Except what?<eos> I was forbidden to make the B'Nar.<eos> That's alright.<eos> I know you've mourned in your heart.<eos> Well, Jono, what do you think of these humans?<eos> They look like me.<eos> They want to keep you, you know.
Big mistake, Van. Big mistake.<eos> - Do you want some sugar?<eos> - I would like a very little bit.<eos> - That much?<eos> - That's perfect.<eos> Raymond offered me a deal.<eos> Uncle Van doesn't have any tea.<eos> Would you like some sugar?<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> If I roll over on you, I skate.
What's your name? I hate you!<eos> Oh, this isn't goin' too well, is it?<eos> Well, why don't we just start over right now?<eos> Man: Get off. Just give me a chance.<eos> I'm pretty funny. Ok, look. Here's a good joke.<eos> There's a proctologist, right? And he's...<eos> I want to hear croaker sing.<eos> I failed, man. I failed.<eos> Oh, there he is, right over there. Bob: Oh.<eos> Schecky, uh, can I be honest with you?
Everyihing is yours. ...and this.<eos> Dance now!<eos> Turn round!<eos> Dance, Ester!<eos> You're beautiful!<eos> I never want to dance again.<eos> I danced during the whole war. I longed for life...<eos> I am damned now.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Why didn't I go with you?
That shrapnel had your name on it.<eos> And Marjatta said she's got two letters from you.<eos> Here's her answer.<eos> A parcel for Aatos Laitila.<eos> Why won't anybody write to me?<eos> You're such a bad person.<eos> They don't know it there.<eos> - Maybe the word's got out.<eos> You'd better get some sleep too, Mauri. - What if the Russians come?<eos> They'll wake you up.
Is too radical for them!<eos> I can't! Is too...<eos> Is too complicated.<eos> I think maybe we could...<eos> work something out. I've had it with the bullshit from this office!<eos> I've asked you ten times to transfer my wife's records to the Mount Sinai. You haven't done it.<eos> They refuse to admit her without them.<eos> - I'm so sorry. The doctors assured me they'd been sent. Bullshit!<eos> I want those files in my hand before I leave!<eos> Mr Glaser, I assure you I'll do everything I can.
I don't know what else to say.<eos> Tell me a story.<eos> A story?<eos> Do you know how it is...<eos> Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?<eos> No.<eos> You go down to the bottom of the sea... where the water isn't even blue any more... and the sky is only a memory... and you float there, in the silence... and you stay there... and you decide... that you'll die for them.<eos> Only then do they start comin' out.<eos> They come, and they greet you, and they judge the love you have for them.<eos> If it's sincere... if it's pure... they'll be with you... and take you away for ever.
Can you tell me what kind of flower these are?<eos> I see them all over the place here.<eos> I never saw such a pretty plant.<eos> They are trumpet pitchers.<eos> They are beautiful.<eos> They do not smell so good, but they are really pretty.<eos> It was nice talking to you.<eos> Sorry about interrupting your meeting but we cannot get anybody to talk to us.<eos> They "zip up", like my mum used to say.<eos> They will not talk to you because they are afraid it will get back to the law.
Did he work for another family?<eos> Your wife's?<eos> It's just that I sense...<eos> She was killed.<eos> She was only 19.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm sorry I made you think of it.<eos> It's a rare gift to see things that others cannot.<eos> It drives some people away.<eos> I don't think people like you to know things before they're ready to tell you.
Go! Climb!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Lost again!<eos> This time I'm gonna win, ready?<eos> They've lost.<eos> What's the matter, are you afraid?<eos> I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid.<eos> Hey, enough games! Take him back!<eos> Good luck, kid.<eos> Stop fooling around you lot!
More fighting in the Mexican crisis today when American troops participated in a joint raid with Mexican nationals against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.<eos> Now this.<eos> Red alert. Red alert.<eos> Red alert.<eos> You crossed my line of death.<eos> You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.<eos> Pakistan is threatening my border.<eos> That's it, buster.<eos> No more military aid.<eos> Nukem, get them before they get you.
Let me out of here!<eos> David!<eos> David!<eos> 48 hours is not gonna be enough time.<eos> Pardon me. Coming through.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> So, how's the testing going?<eos> Terrible.<eos> But at least I get to go home tomorrow.<eos> They told you that you're going home tomorrow?
All these years,<eos> I've written so many books with fantastic themes.<eos> Everyone that sees me will ask, how can you come out all these?<eos> Is it real story?<eos> This is a stupid question.<eos> Everyone, in everyday, there are a lot happen around you.
Mariana is condemned to death... it will matter not that she is a woman.<eos> Pedrosa will seat her on the scaffold... and give the order to the executioner, with the conviction... that he is fulfilling what he considers his duty.<eos> By taking her life... he thinks he performs a worthy act for King and Government... of benefit to the Country and of use to society.<eos> I won't remind you what they think of us.<eos> We are not revolutionaries, we're worse than heretics!<eos> I know I owe my Iife to Mariana Pineda.<eos> But I cannot return.<eos> I cannot.<eos> It is my duty to tell you you have the right to a lawyer.<eos> If you do not chose one, one will be chosen for you.
Everybody back!<eos> To a neutral corner, please.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - Nothing's goin' on!<eos> Would you get that animal off of me?<eos> This place should be wall-to-wall tits by now.<eos> Guy paints a beautiful picture.<eos> All right!<eos> All right! I'll find out what's goin' on.<eos> Looks like the only guy who got screwed was you.
- I'm ready.<eos> Remember, in the church the women must be stared at!<eos> - (IN LATIN) The Lord be with you.<eos> - And with your spirit.<eos> Stand up!<eos> When everyone stands, you also stand.<eos> Is it so difficult to learn?<eos> Look at the green one.<eos> - Has she looked at you?<eos> - No, but... Look! If you look at them, they'll look at you.
This way gentlemen.<eos> (hits) Easy son, I've shot men for less than that.<eos> This watering hole's not bad.<eos> Nice heifers around here.<eos> Ain't much grass though.<eos> Yep, this is my kind of place.<eos> I'll be with you in just a moment sir.<eos> What's everybody around here so happy about?<eos> No trouble at all, we'll be delighted to see you again. Oh no, we'll be happy to...<eos> Now then, may I help you?
There's no extra charge for this unique attraction.<eos> Our underwater tunnels are not only fun, but informative.<eos> Oh, look at that. 'Consumed alive in history, Jonah found out what it was like 'to live in the belly of the ocean's greatest animal.<eos> 'Our special Jonah and the Whale showcase is at 11:00, 1:00 and 4:00 'in the amphitheatre inside the Undersea Kingdom.'<eos> Ha-ha-ha-ha. This is Captain Sink. Welcome to my cave of fun and surprises.<eos> Oh, yuck! I sure am gonna miss these guys.<eos> How 'bout it, Casper?<eos> You wanna take the money and run to Venezuela with old Mikey?<eos> - Quieres un pescado? - You speak Spanish?<eos> I think they're gonna miss you, too.
In the future, I hope the rest of you will be more careful.<eos> Ben?<eos> I guess that makes you the head man here now, doesn't it?<eos> I wasn't thinking much about myself, Mr. Costa.<eos> I just don't see how something like that could happen.<eos> Come on now, Ben. We still got a camp to feed here now, don't we?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Besides, fifty bucks more a week can't be all that bad, now, can it?<eos> No, sir. I always thought he had a little devil in him.<eos> And fifteen dollars a week more for the rest of you, eh?
- How do you know him?<eos> - It comes...<eos> - With the job.<eos> He killed nine people in New York City four years ago.<eos> - You're not serious.<eos> - I'm very serious.<eos> - What station are you from?<eos> - West 75th Street.<eos> - It won't help calling anybody.<eos> - They sent you.
Yes, I'll help you, Hendrik.<eos> If only one could live for ever.<eos> Here's your passport for France. You have five minutes to pack.<eos> Yes, but why?<eos> We're waiting. Hurry up.<eos> You needn't thank me for this raise. I made it a condition for taking over this job.<eos> Everything's covered with dust!<eos> If you don't clean the dressing rooms as well as all the others, you may have to look for another job, outside the Prussian State Theater.<eos> I hope we'll get along. If you have any problems, come to me.<eos> I would like to treat you all to coffee.
Nothing at all.<eos> Is it your intention to agree to this marriage and to join your consent to that of her mother who leaves her at liberty to do as she likes?<eos> But you do not know that this consent is no longer sufficient and that heaven has given me back a brother at the same time that it has given me back a father and you have now to obtain me from him.<eos> Heaven has not restored you to me to oppose your wishes.<eos> Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father.<eos> Do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary and consent, as I do, to this double marriage.<eos> In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket.<eos> You shall see it safe and sound.<eos> I have no money to give my children in marriage.<eos> Never mind, I have some. Do not let this trouble you.
What is your name?<eos> Schroeder.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> You can come out of this war alive.<eos> If I shoot you.<eos> Not a serious wound, of course.<eos> I'll tell the Americans I shot you to save their general from being blown up.<eos> I will show them all the hidden explosives, the fuses.<eos> They will take you prisoner.
Berivan is reason for your weakness.<eos> You were like a falcon.<eos> Now you're no different than an old jackal.<eos> You degraded Veysikans' name because of her.<eos> You're my father. Be merciful. I respect you.<eos> Let us leave so you can get rid of us.<eos> - Where will you go?<eos> - Wherever.<eos> Go.<eos> Halilans takes you.
Can I see you a sec?<eos> I wanted to get your impressions of one phase... here.<eos> Just after the turbine trip, did you feel a vibration?<eos> - The steam line closure. - No, that's here.<eos> I mean later.<eos> - More of a vibration.<eos> - Right here.<eos> It's relief valve 14.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Didn't they ask you about this?
He'll be fighting for you. He's going to Vietnam to fight, to save your life.<eos> - I don't care what he's gonna do.<eos> - To save your life!<eos> Or what you do.<eos> I want you out.<eos> I tell you, if you want me out, you're gonna have to throw me out.<eos> That's exactly what I'm gonna do, Mr Berger.<eos> I'll get the police.<eos> I'm not gonna muss myself up fussing with you.<eos> I'll have the police get you out, if I have to.
But if you find the killers, and it can be shown... That my superiors in the government have concealed evidence, If you can expose their lies, their abuse of power,<eos> He's out of his senses. He doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> Yes, he does, watson.<eos> He knows full well. He knows exactly what he's doing.<eos> A man devoid of conscience, as guilty as the murderer himself.<eos> She trustedyou, mr. Holmes.<eos> She came out of hiding because she trustedyou.<eos> So, if they got her, it's because she trusted god-Almighty sherlock holmes.<eos> - Foxborough, stay away from me.<eos> -They used you.
It's like I told you.<eos> We were at Paul's party.<eos> - Your brother was there as well?<eos> - No. You know he was working.<eos> We left the party alone at about quarter to 1 1 .<eos> It... lt started to rain cats and dogs.<eos> We were standing under an awning when... when he came up to us.<eos> Who came up to you?<eos> My brother - Andrew Lowery.<eos> - He joined you under the awning?
- Well, what is it?<eos> - A letter inside explains everything.<eos> - Carl, you can hardly expect...<eos> - They have to be warned!<eos> I'm too old.<eos> I'm too ill.<eos> I can't go myself.<eos> And I am the only living person who knows the truth.<eos> I've got a reputation to maintain!<eos> That is why it has to be you.
Stop that.<eos> Stop that.<eos> This way.<eos> You know what?<eos> I can't help wondering how old you are, old man.<eos> For your age, you sure are tough.<eos> A necessity.<eos> I've had to be tough to be able to survive to this age.<eos> No, I'm not like young men today.<eos> None of you can fight.
No, it's got something to do with those two.<eos> We've done nothing.<eos> Trading, that's all.<eos> This lot west of Marbury had the rye.<eos> And we bought it, we gave them what the kids gave us.<eos> Straight up, no profit.<eos> We thought we were helping them.<eos> How were we supposed to know it had fungus or whatever it is?<eos> Why don't you go after the lot that sold it to us?<eos> Yeah, well, we will, once we've dealt with you.
Some honest citizen called us and told us about a suspicious looking character on 24th Street.<eos> We nabbed him on the spot.<eos> Oh.<eos> You do the report. I'll show these boys the way to the boss.<eos> Don't worry, we'll find it.<eos> No bother come on. I'll take you to old Papa McBride.<eos> Come on let's go.<eos> So long, see you around.<eos> Papa McBride, he must be a real nice guy.<eos> After you.
Don't you know men aren't supposed to look... in a lady's handbag?<eos> Lady?<eos> You're fired, Grizelda.<eos> No wonder you people... are always in the unemployment line.<eos> Now give me that bag!<eos> I don't want no white man looking at my Tampax!<eos> I wouldn't worry about your Tampax if I were you.<eos> Well, look at this-- my savings account book... with withdrawal slips, my lottery ticket... and two rolls of toilet paper.<eos> I'm placing you under citizen's arrest.<eos> I'm going to call the police and report you.
In my room?<eos> - Yeah, I thought I would.<eos> - All right, l`ll get blankets for you.<eos> Frank, how come you left, really?<eos> It`s not easy to explain, Anthony.<eos> A lot of things.<eos> One day you look at a crucifix, and all you see is a man dying on a cross.<eos> But that`s only a backdrop to something else.<eos> Mama and Papa, their dreams of pious glory.<eos> They turn you into what they wish at the time.
It was before most of the settlers came here.<eos> There were plague victims in the house and in some of the cottages.<eos> That barn was their funeral pyre.<eos> Well, Knox didn't say that.<eos> Well, he wouldn't, would he?<eos> I probably get the credit, or rather the blame for anything that goes wrong on this estate.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> You can be on your way whenever you want.<eos> Would you like a cigarette before you go?<eos> They want to talk to you.
- She's well tamed.<eos> We should make a selection, I am a sensitive person.<eos> She's the daughter of accountant Chimp.<eos> or Sir Gorilly.<eos> - Cheetah, do you like bananas?<eos> - Cheetah, flip over.<eos> - No.<eos> - Her father is here.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> Anyway, I wish you all my humblest Christmas greetings and a respectable happy new year.
- Mother, just listen to me.<eos> Kenny, don't you talk to me in that tone of voice.<eos> I love you too, Mama.<eos> I really do.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Let's find Barnett.<eos> I hope he's not in a bad mood.<eos> - Hey, Barnett.<eos> - I'm obliged to you, but...
It's where the killings started.<eos> If they're man-made, they were made here.<eos> It's less than ten clicks from here.<eos> Our birds can make that, but... it's probably one way.<eos> I've been digging for clues with the civilians.<eos> I found intel on Masarov.<eos> It's been retrofitted several times over the last decade by the central regime.<eos> It's got "weapons research" written all over it.<eos> Okay, you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate.<eos> It's up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this.
Go!<eos> - Let's move!<eos> - On me!<eos> - All units, you are clear to engage.<eos> - Move in!<eos> - Move it!<eos> Lock and load.<eos> - Move out.<eos> - Let's move.<eos> Right behind you!
Don't you remember me, Jonny?<eos> No.<eos> Jonny Jonny from the Big Apple needing a little taste of the English rose?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I was fifteen.<eos> But you were a very big fifteen, sweetheart. Oh, God.<eos> I want you to go over there and talk to her casually.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then I'll come over and join you and she'll think I'm cool... and before you know it, I'll be doing her P. R.
We are just waiting for her to change her will and die.<eos> Oh, Eddy.<eos> I mean, has she changed her will yet?<eos> All in good time, Eds, all in good time.<eos> Oh, I say. Hello.<eos> I'll just go and check that out.<eos> Saffy, listen.<eos> I'm not coming home, so stop phoning me!<eos> I've got the rest of my life to live and I'm going to live it.<eos> I'm done with all of you, so forget me.
Ah, you don't. Quit it.<eos> You quit it.<eos> God sake.<eos> Hey, get away from that ledge. You damn fool kids.<eos> You gonna break your neck.<eos> It's them Doss's kids. Crazy as their old man.<eos> They dug up the corner of Jack's remain.<eos> Put him in the sidewalk.<eos> You boys won't recognize it now.<eos> Mind you I doubt they'll recognize you.

Working in a paper mill aren't going to save this country.<eos> Looks like a movie star.<eos> Huh boy?<eos> Nice uniform. Good hat.<eos> Reminds me how Hardy get in his look in this uniform when we went to France.<eos> Remember him Dorothy?<eos> Don't Tom.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying how snappy Hal looks in his uniform.<eos> All you girls certainly seems to think so.
- Are you okay?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> No one says take a rest.<eos> Move your asses to the finish line.<eos> Move.<eos> Hustle.<eos> Hustle.<eos> Get your asses across damn line.<eos> Aye, nice work Doss.<eos> This is a personal gift from the United States government to each and everyone of you.
Up above. I just simply believe what I believe.<eos> Well I'm trying to understand.<eos> Alright?<eos> Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?<eos> God says not to kill.<eos> That one of His most important commandments.<eos> Most people take that to only don't commit murder.<eos> War is completely different set of circumstances.<eos> Jesus said a new commandment I give them to you.<eos> That you love one another. Just as I love you.
I hope you learned that lesson.<eos> There will be no passes this weekend.<eos> You all will be on KP.<eos> Right now everybody on full gear for 20-mile hike.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get your heads right.<eos> Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> Makes me sick seeing you feel sorry for yourself.<eos> You dogs don't know what tired is.
A little bit.<eos> That is good. That is very good.<eos> Therefore, I will speak slowly.<eos> Do you like Mozart, Wolfgang?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause you'll be meeting him soon.<eos> Listen!<eos> I've been hunting deer since I was 12!<eos> And they are five times faster than you!
Oh, the rage that burns within consumes my very heart.<eos> Ah, no.<eos> Do not believe it. - I cannot endure it.<eos> - Please stop.<eos> Hear me!<eos> - No, I cannot!<eos> You plead in vain for pity toward her.<eos> Words of vengeance are all I shall listen to.<eos> Treacherous pair!<eos> My violent wrath will now descend upon you!
Bello, what are you doing?<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - He was looking... at you.<eos> Minnie, I picked them by the "Black Torrent...<eos> Back home, there are lots of them!<eos> Oh thanks, Joe!<eos> A hawker from San Francisco came through the camp today.<eos> He had lace and ribbons.<eos> This is for you.
it suits me, believe me.<eos> I live there all alone but I'm not afraid. I feel I can trust you,<eos> even though I don't know who you are...<eos> I'm not really sure who I am either.<eos> I've loved life and I love it still, and it still seems beautiful to me.<eos> Sure, you love it too, but you haven't lived long enough to see right into the things of this world.<eos> I don't know anything about that. I'm only a poor girl, humble and good-for-nothing:<eos> you say such fine things to me that maybe I don't understand...<eos> I don't know what it is, but in my heart I feel unhappy at being so tiny<eos> and I long to raise myself up to you, up, up as high as the stars,
you say such fine things to me that maybe I don't understand...<eos> I don't know what it is, but in my heart I feel unhappy at being so tiny<eos> and I long to raise myself up to you, up, up as high as the stars,<eos> to be close to you, to be able to talk to you.<eos> What you cannot say, your heart told me<eos> when I gave you my arm and we danced:<eos> I felt you trembling against my breast;<eos> and I experienced a strange joy,<eos> a new peace that I cannot describe!<eos> I can't read my heart, like you:
What are you thinking about?<eos> Just a thought...<eos> You didn't come to the "Polka" tonight on account of me...<eos> What brought you then?<eos> Perhaps you did mistake the trail<eos> to Micheltorena's?<eos> Wowkle, bring the coffee!<eos> What a pretty little room!<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's all full of you...
I am Ramerrez; I was born a Vagabond:<eos> thief was my name from the day I came into the world.<eos> But while my father was alive, I never knew it.<eos> Six months ago, my father died.<eos> The only means to support my mother and brothers was my father's legacy:<eos> a gang of highway bandits!<eos> I accepted it.<eos> That was my destiny!<eos> But one day I met you...<eos> I dreamt of going far away with you, far, far away,
- Two aces and a pair...<eos> - Nothing!<eos> - Even!<eos> We're even!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> - The next hand decides it!<eos> - Yes. Cut!<eos> Rance, I'm sorry for the harsh words...<eos> Discard!<eos> I've always thought well of you, Jack Rance, and always will...
He must be taken alive!<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - We're on his trail...<eos> - This way...<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Across the mountain!<eos> The whole valley is on the lookout!<eos> Ashby, see you soon!<eos> Goodbye!<eos> I'm coming with you!
Take your time with that noose.<eos> You'll be sorry if you let me down!<eos> I'll kill you, so watch it!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Lynch him!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Hang the Spaniard!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Sheriff Rance!<eos> I hand this man over to you to be given in charge to the community.
of the woman I love...<eos> - Two minutes left to love her!<eos> - That's enough, by God! Make him shut up!<eos> That's enough!<eos> String him up! Shut him up!<eos> He can talk from that branch!<eos> Let him speak!<eos> He's got a right to!<eos> Thank you, Sonora!<eos> For her, for her alone whom you all love, I ask a favour and a promise of you.
What justice do you mean, you old blackguard?<eos> Mind your tongue, woman!<eos> What can you do to me?<eos> I'm not afraid of you!<eos> Come on now!<eos> Hang him!<eos> You won't do it!<eos> None of you would dare!<eos> Drag her away from there!<eos> Hasn't any of you got blood in his veins?
- We can't!<eos> - He can say what he likes!<eos> - And you, dear Happy, and you, Bello,...<eos> - We're the bosses!<eos> Don't go against her!<eos> - with your baby blue eyes.<eos> - Come on!<eos> We have to!<eos> - We can't!<eos> - All of you, brothers of my heart,...
We have to!<eos> - We can't!<eos> - All of you, brothers of my heart,...<eos> - Say you will, too!<eos> - rough, good-hearted souls...<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You want to!<eos> - Look, I'll throw down this gun!<eos> - We can't refuse!<eos> - I'm once more the girl I was before to you...
I got a two-acre pond that is just thick with catfish and bass...<eos> I don't fish.<eos> I shoot.<eos> Well, the farm's a perfect place to do a little plinking', so...<eos> Well...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You take care, son.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My daughter's meeting me for lunch.<eos> I think you two just might hit it off.
Ed! It's Lee lacocca. Listen, I changed my mind on this whole retirement thing.<eos> Turns out I want your job after all.<eos> Yeah, it's Gates.<eos> Okay. All right, I'll talk to you later.<eos> All right.<eos> So no dinner.<eos> Lee. Follow the noise.<eos> Diane Lester.<eos> - Memo of talking points. - Hello? Hello?<eos> You guys at Ibis can't do anything right these days, can you?
Yeah.<eos> Well, now they can.<eos> - Logo's ready.<eos> - Put it up on the big screen.<eos> All right, Lee. Go to work.<eos> Watch what we can do.<eos> I want to talk to everybody out there. Every single person that's watching me right now.<eos> And here's what I want you to do.<eos> I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.<eos> I'm gonna be upfront with you. I don't want you to do it because you're gonna make money.
I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.<eos> I'm gonna be upfront with you. I don't want you to do it because you're gonna make money.<eos> I want you to do it because it'll save my life.<eos> This is ballsy.<eos> The old Money Monster bump.<eos> The old Money Monster bump on a massive scale.<eos> - Where's my stock price?<eos> - Just got it up.<eos> It's simple math. Value comes from demand.<eos> So if every single one of you buys a few shares, then we can get the price of this sucker up in no time.
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.<eos> We take care of each other. It's embedded in our DNA.<eos> Not because an equation tells us to, but because we feel it in here.<eos> And right now, I need your help.<eos> This looks promising.<eos> We can do the right thing.<eos> But we have to do it together.<eos> Come on.<eos> Refresh, refresh.<eos> So, I'm talking to every one of you. Every single person that's watching me right now.

This is all her fault.<eos> Go ahead, Diane, walk away.<eos> You're the only reason we're stuck here with this psycho.<eos> You wanted transparency, Walt?<eos> Well, here's your chance.<eos> Everybody hates you.<eos> Okay, now look, everything is fine.<eos> So why don't we just put the weapons down, and let's just talk about it.<eos> No, I... I think we can talk with the weapons up. Right, guys?<eos> - This is Money Monster, coming to you live. - Back off.
Fire!<eos> -Fire!<eos> -Stop!<eos> Sorry!<eos> My fault.<eos> Crane, go high.<eos> I mean low! Low!<eos> Ah, my claw thingy!<eos> Viper and Tigress, do, like, a Totem Pole Poison Technique!<eos> You two, do a Swarming Insect Bite... with a Yellow Tail, Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna...
Mastering chi requires mastery of self.<eos> Oogway sat alone in a cave for 30 years asking one question.<eos> "Who am I?"<eos> "Who am I?"<eos> I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt...<eos> So now I have to sit alone in a cave for 30 years?<eos> Eventually.<eos> After you master teaching.<eos> Teaching?<eos> There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.
Master Porcupine!<eos> I thought he died a hundred years ago.<eos> These guys are legend!<eos> Get a quick sketch of us.<eos> Did you get it? Did you get it?<eos> I blinked.<eos> Can we get another one?<eos> I'm being choked by Master Porcupine.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Oh, look. It's you!
-No!<eos> -"We can learn kung fu"? -After that!<eos> "We can be just like you"?<eos> -Yes!<eos> -We can?<eos> No! You can't!<eos> But you don't have to be!<eos> That's what Shifu meant.<eos> I don't have to turn you into me.<eos> I have to turn you into you!
Okay? Let's try it again.<eos> We see the undertow and we say.<eos> There's the undertow.<eos> There's the undertow.<eos> There's the undertow.<eos> There you find the undertow and we see the undertow.<eos> - Did I forget again?<eos> - No, no. - No, sweetie. It's okay.<eos> - No biggie, cupcake.<eos> What if I forget you?
I was just asking about the one part.<eos> Because, look, if I said that. I'm not positive I did. It's-It's actually a complement.<eos> Because I asked her to wait. And I said, "It's what you do best." So I...<eos> I... Oh, it's my fault!<eos> It's all my fault!<eos> She got kidnapped and taken into...<eos> whatever this place is.<eos> What if it's a restaurant?<eos> Oy!<eos> You two.
Wow!<eos> Where are they?<eos> Okay.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have you seen a mom and a dad without me?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Have you seen a couple?<eos> They are old like you, not old like you but older than you even.
Hello.<eos> I'm...<eos> - Dory!<eos> Look at you.<eos> - Oh, my baby.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - I mean, look at you.<eos> - You found us. - I'm never letting you go again.<eos> - My missing girl, you are here.<eos> - It's you.
- Dory!<eos> Look at you.<eos> - Oh, my baby.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - I mean, look at you.<eos> - You found us. - I'm never letting you go again.<eos> - My missing girl, you are here.<eos> - It's you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Really you.
That where the nickname came from?<eos> You fought it off.<eos> Yeah, lucky me.<eos> Is this your sister's?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, lucky you.<eos> You get to help avenge her death.<eos> This puts out a signal that we can track.<eos> You kids are the most important thing right now.<eos> We need every one of you to help us fight the Others.
God!<eos> Sam.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> God!<eos> I'm sorry, Sam.<eos> When I was a child, I spoke as a child.<eos> I thought and I reasoned as a child.<eos> But when I became a man,<eos> I put away childish things.<eos> Those words never meant more to me than they do right now, looking at all of you.
You Zombie? Yeah.<eos> I was the leader of my last squad.<eos> No doubt.<eos> So the guy I replace went Section 8. Why?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It's your squad, too, now.<eos> Keep staring at my ass and I'll rip your throats out.<eos> Let's be clear.<eos> I'm not taking orders from you.<eos> I'm not gonna die with you geniuses.
Good.<eos> Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist and pull it toward you.<eos> - Like that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good job.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> Can I have...<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't be so scared of your weapon.<eos> You gotta think that the gun is a part of you.
I left him back at the base.<eos> - I was trying to protect him.<eos> - Jeez. - I gotta go back.<eos> - That's suicide, dude.<eos> - No, man.<eos> I gotta go back.<eos> - You can't just wander back in there.<eos> - They'll know. - I can't leave him there!<eos> I'll put the tracker back in. They'll pick me up.<eos> You guys go ahead. I will meet up with you later.
Ben Parish.<eos> Ben Parish?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was just here.<eos> I told you not to follow me.<eos> Well, I decided to ignore you.<eos> I've been planting bombs.<eos> In about 10 minutes, when the last plane full of kids takes off, I'm taking this place down, for good.<eos> I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.<eos> I was wrong when I said I was both one of you and one of them.
And on the blanket you brought... I thought it was to make us comfortable, but then I realized afterwards it wasnt, was it?<eos> It was so that twigs and earth would not stick to my clothes. so no one would suspect.<eos> I did not want us to get caught.<eos> every waking moment was about How I could get closer to you, How to talk to you I was obsessed with you.<eos> I still leave work early, I come home...<eos> I work on my car, my car didnt need work<eos> I do it just that I could be near you.<eos> You remember.<eos> We both knew the risks.<eos> One of you seen Peter?
I do not know.<eos> - Just one drink.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just one.<eos> Is that your?<eos> There it is, do you see it?<eos> That's our new life.<eos> Listen, why do you call him Ray?<eos> It is a long story.<eos> Was there something going on between you two?
You're not only thief but a liar, too!<eos> No, I'm not!<eos> I'm not lying, Madame.<eos> Come, sweety, let's go.<eos> I'm not a liar.<eos> I don't lie!<eos> Come along!<eos> Cool!<eos> Watch out!<eos> We're faster than you.
You're not eating?<eos> Isn't it good?<eos> We're on a hunger strike, until Camille returns.<eos> Camille will come back.<eos> She's coming to see the judge who'll decide, if her aunt may keep her or not.<eos> Dear Camille, since you left, it hasn't been much fun.<eos> We tried having a hunger strike, but it ddn't work.<eos> The Beatrice's mother came.<eos> She hid herself in Rosie's arms.<eos> I wanna stay with you.
I don't know.<eos> But you have time to think about it.<eos> You and Camille.<eos> Voila.<eos> See you soon, big guy.<eos> See you soon, Raymond.<eos> I want to thank you all, for saving my life.<eos> Especially Simon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I never thought, life could be so cool. With you it's really cool.
Maybe she's just asleep.<eos> Thanks for stopping by.<eos> Maybe you should climb under his covers tonight. What?<eos> He looks at me like I'm trash.<eos> We're not people. We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.<eos> We tat the lace for your fucking curtains.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> You know what... - Don't fucking touch me.<eos> My whole life, I got the high hat and the icy mitt from people like your father.<eos> We're not less than you.
A task which is made more difficult by your erratic import schedules.<eos> We don't control the tides.<eos> Tides have been fine from here to Miami.<eos> We know nothing of the boats to Miami.<eos> Señor Famosa assures me the tides have been calm all summer.<eos> And you say Señor Famosa's name, so we worry you may overtake our supply routes.<eos> No. I use Señor Famosa's name to reassure you that from now on, you can work directly with me and that you can charge me a higher price.<eos> - What do we get in return?<eos> - You get access to Ormino's cops and judges, which we now control.<eos> And most of whom wouldn't do business with you otherwise because you're Cuban.
We aren't men to be muscled or conned.<eos> We're an institution.<eos> We can't be bribed or bullied because I simply represent the vested interest of a board of governors.<eos> We are the landed white gentry in this country and we have no plans to carve off a strip of this country, which we have gone to great pains to break and colonize and hand it over to Catholics, Jews, darkies or dagos.<eos> It's just a bigger, better racket.<eos> That's all.<eos> Keeping the money in your hands and out of the hands of people like us.<eos> All those people, the Negro on whose back you went to great pains to break this country and the immigrants who came over here with nothing and worked their fingers to the fucking bone, all believed it when you told them they could get ahead.<eos> And one day, and I may not live to see it, they're gonna figure it out.<eos> But I tell you what. I'd hate to fucking be you.
How is my son?<eos> Your son is dead now.<eos> They would have killed every last one of us. Hunted us down. You know that.<eos> They didn't expect to see old age.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I had this whole thing I was gonna say to Albert before I killed him.<eos> Too late.<eos> All right.<eos> I don't wanna see anyone else get killed today.<eos> Any of you guys wanna die?
She'll catch us or she won't.<eos> But either way, we shall be free.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> Aye, I do.<eos> I give you my life and my death.<eos> Stand or fall, I'll never leave your side, I swear it to you.<eos> Yes, I know this story.<eos> The girl goes in secret to meet her one true love.<eos> I wonder how it ends this time.<eos> I gave you both everything. And in return you betray me.
Doreena!<eos> Coming, Mrs. Bromwyn!<eos> Keep an eye on this lot.<eos> Shoot the he-dwarves if they get mouthy.<eos> Or if you just feel like it.<eos> You don't just cut it.<eos> You thirsty?<eos> I could get you some water, if you'd like.<eos> Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'd like that a lot.<eos> Ah! I mean, nah, I don't want nothing from the likes of you.
They say they keep all their treasure there in that wood.<eos> Gold, silver, jewels, as far as the eye can see.<eos> If your mirror is shiny, it'll be in there somewhere.<eos> Can we access the Sanctuary from there?<eos> Dunno.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Will you show us the way?<eos> Ah. Well, you see, that's where the proposition comes in.<eos> You see, no one's ever come out of them woods alive.<eos> But you two big ones, you look like Huntsmen.
Faster.<eos> Follow your brother.<eos> Look lively now.<eos> You as well. Go on.<eos> Shut it.<eos> Stop sniveling. Twerp.<eos> Keep walking. Just keep walking.<eos> It's not my sister's fault, my lord.<eos> She was hit in the face as a baby with a rock.<eos> You two, come with me.
Instead, you break my heart and turn hers against me.<eos> Pretty.<eos> You see, Huntsman, love doesn't save your life.<eos> I should know.<eos> I've been dead before.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Stand or fall.<eos> Together.<eos> - I stand with you.
You see, you said it yourself, you're something between this world and the Mirror.<eos> I summoned you out.<eos> Now you are bound to me!<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Mirror, Mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all?<eos> You are, my queen.<eos> But not for long.<eos> Your sister holds a baby to her breast.<eos> A daughter.<eos> She will grow to be more beautiful than even you.
Mirror, Mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all?<eos> You are, my queen.<eos> But not for long.<eos> Your sister holds a baby to her breast.<eos> A daughter.<eos> She will grow to be more beautiful than even you.<eos> You cannot ask such a thing of me.<eos> I ask nothing.<eos> I am but a reflection.<eos> And you...
Now, get in the car.<eos> Right now.<eos> Get in this car.<eos> Put your seat belt on, for Christ's sake.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Come on!<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> - Let's go, let's go.<eos> What is going on here, Tim?<eos> Are you stealing secrets from MBI?<eos> We're not stealing secrets from you.
- No.<eos> Can you turn the air conditioner on, please?<eos> - It's not going on!<eos> - It's hot.<eos> My seat belt's not on!<eos> Wait!<eos> Okay, it's about to get weird.<eos> About to get weird?<eos> Quick question.<eos> Are you guys the good guys or bad guys?
Is it somebody we know?<eos> Can't say that, either.<eos> You just said we were entitled to the truth.<eos> Did say you were entitled to it. Doesn't mean we can give it to you.<eos> You know what, honey? It's probably classified. That's why they can't tell us.<eos> - Do you want any of this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll have some potatoes.<eos> I'm glad everybody's just enjoying their meal while we're in the middle of a... Like, a thing!<eos> You guys are just eating like there's nothing going on.
Jesus. Jeff.<eos> Jeff, please, do something!<eos> Either you talk...<eos> Jeff, stop her please!<eos> She's a psychopath!<eos> Tim, can I just have a word with you guys for one second, please?<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Okay, okay. - Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.<eos> Relax.<eos> We're excited that you guys are still alive.
Mr. Rascal Flatts?<eos> I needed a cover name.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi!<eos> Yes, this is Rascal.<eos> Are you and your wife ready to make the deal?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I are very excited about it.<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p.m.<eos> Go to the V-Bar. A table will be reserved for you.
- That's our table.<eos> - No, this way.<eos> Really?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Is this the line to the little boys' room?<eos> - I don't need to use it.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> I... It's part of the...<eos> I thought it was just gonna be us.<eos> You fellas with The Scorpion?
- Perfect, as promised.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Ivan?<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay!<eos> We got it. Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That checks out.<eos> Well, pleasure doing business with both of you.
Spare me the morality! - Hey!<eos> Just hear me out, all right?<eos> Look, the Gaffneys, they don't belong in our world.<eos> We don't. We really don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're too good for that.<eos> Why don't we let them go back to their world?<eos> And then you and I, we, can settle this here?<eos> Here in our world.<eos> You guys can go murder each other and stuff. Just leave us out of this.
Keep it all. Maybe you could videotape that and put it online.<eos> Where did you get the gun from? No.<eos> I don't think we're gonna keep any of that online.<eos> That would get a lot of hits. And I lined it up, and smashed.<eos> Because there's shooting...<eos> Probably wanna keep it a little on the down low. Yes.<eos> Of course. Yeah, no, no, of course.<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I'm so proud of you guys.
- You look fine.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Joining us live from her stunning home in New York City to talk about her new haute couture bra line that is tearing up the runways, ladies and gentlemen is... Georgina Scott.<eos> Georgina, welcome.<eos> Gosh, you look phenomenal and I can't even see your bra.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You sure know what to say to a girl.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm really excited to talk to you guys.
- You're stealing our land!<eos> - And our livelihood.<eos> It won't sweeten.<eos> It'll only sour.<eos> - They're coming in!<eos> - Everybody on out!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is God's house.<eos> Both of you!
This is as good a place as any.<eos> Into the mine, Faraday.<eos> If you're gonna kill me, kill me.<eos> If you're gonna rob me, rob me.<eos> But I will not go in that mine.<eos> There's rats in there.<eos> Virginia City?<eos> Three days past?<eos> Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!<eos> I assure you I did not have to cheat to beat the likes of you two.
Buy me a drink, sugar.<eos> - Better get her all nailed down.<eos> - I keep telling him. He just don't listen.<eos> Kristen.<eos> That man's trouble.<eos> Afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> Town's got a ban on firearms.<eos> Check 'em in.<eos> Get 'em back on your way out.<eos> You don't mind me asking, but how is it all of you go so well-heeled?
What's his story?<eos> My manservant.<eos> He's harmless.<eos> Saved his life in Shanghai, debt of honor and the like.<eos> Now, you don't mind giving up those guns, do you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Law and order, I say.<eos> Sheriff?<eos> Now, I must tell you that I'm more than happy to cooperate.<eos> I can't say the same thing for my compadres behind you.
They're just dreams, Goody.<eos> You talk about guns, you talk about women, you talk about 'em separately.<eos> It ain't right.<eos> Sure it is.<eos> Sure it is, my friend.<eos> I had a wife once.<eos> Had a family.<eos> Had some children, too.<eos> One time.<eos> Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine.
- Here you go.<eos> Okay, pues.<eos> - That far enough?<eos> - That'll do!<eos> All right, two or three more of those, then we're good.<eos> That's it, right there.<eos> Look. Look. Look.<eos> Watch your head now, Teddy.<eos> Now you can pray for us, Father.<eos> My brother, I will pray for you until I forget how to pray.
No one'll hold no ill will towards you.<eos> What about you?<eos> I...<eos> I believe I'm gonna see this through.<eos> These people deserve their lives back.<eos> I have nowhere else to go, so I'm in.<eos> You know, I knew that tomorrow was gonna be a dark day.<eos> And now that there's one less of us, gonna be darker.<eos> But to be in the service of others with men that I respect,<eos> like you all...
The spirit led you here.<eos> You have nothing to fear.<eos> Take it.<eos> No, please.<eos> Take it.<eos> Behold...<eos> Your faith, even as tiny as a mustard seed, can move mountains.<eos> This is the message from the son of God!<eos> The miracles I do, you can do also.<eos> The power of God is within you!
I'm getting a patty melt.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Look, maybe, uh...<eos> Maybe you could be too tired as well.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Come a long way since, "mall."<eos> Hey, guys, Peaches is already asleep.<eos> You guys wanna get something to eat?<eos> You know, um... Do you guys mind maybe just going by yourselves?
Okay?<eos> So, you keep your problems over there and I'll keep my problems over here.<eos> You wipe my ass, and I'll say thank you.<eos> End of fucking story.<eos> Are we still going to the big pit?<eos> No.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Not fucking fine!<eos> I have exactly one life.<eos> And for reasons I myself don't really understand, I now believe that that life will not be fulfilled unless I am standing at the bottom of the world's deepest pit with you two perverts.
Come on, honestly!<eos> HE GASPS Little shit-stain! HE LAUGHS Oh, no, yes.<eos> We do have a laugh.<eos> When I got asked to come and do this show,<eos> I said, "You do know I'm boring, don't you?"<eos> And they said, "How boring?"<eos> I said, "I'm so boring, my nickname is Steve Davis." LAUGHTER I'm glad you find that one funny.<eos> - Go on, my son.<eos> - My shot, is it?<eos> 'A very good morning to you.
We had to have faith in each other.<eos> What a suitable ending, I think.<eos> # Love me # I ain't got nothing but love, babe<eos> # Eight days a week<eos> # Love you every day, girl<eos> # Always on my mind<eos> # One thing I can say, girl<eos> Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.<eos> We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.<eos> This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you.
When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already.<eos> But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well, 'cor the blimeys, heave the mo'.<eos> Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in the Royal Variety Show.<eos> This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because Love Me Do got into the Top Twenty, and we can't believe, really, that so many things have happened in between already.<eos> Just before I pass you over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year, and everyone who sent me gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October.<eos> I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens.<eos> - In the meantime... - This is Paul here.<eos> Everything that John said goes for me too, especially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, cos all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June...<eos> ...when it was my birthday.<eos> Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
- Whats that for?<eos> - Visual aid.<eos> Look, I'm never going to be able to speak their words, if they aren't talking.<eos> But they might have some sort of written language or basis for visual communication.<eos> Ok.<eos> Let's start.<eos> Human.<eos> Human.<eos> I'm human.<eos> And you?
These are grade school words.<eos> Eating, walking.<eos> Help me understand.<eos> No no no!<eos> Not the top!<eos> Ok, this is where you want to get to, right?<eos> - That is the question. - Right.<eos> So, first we need to make sure that they understand what a question is.<eos> The nature of our request for information on the response.<eos> Then we need to clarify the difference between a specific "you"... and a collective "you".
The weapon is their language.<eos> They gave it all to us. So we can learn Hepta¡pode?<eos> If you learn it... really learn it, you get to perceive time the way they do. So you get to see whats to happen.<eos> But time, it isn't the same for them.<eos> - It is not linear.<eos> - Look...<eos> We did our best but it wasn't enough.<eos> The captain will lift off in 5 minutes.<eos> Ian, Louise...<eos> It was an honor to work with you.
Cavo for you as a tax for everything I've seen ...<eos> It is a poor substitute for its beauty<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> Would you marry a German?<eos> - What does he have? - He is a good man.<eos> It makes no difference to you right?<eos> If you marry him, it will be without my blessing.<eos> And without my money.<eos> The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit ... bless and protect you.<eos> May the Lord have mercy on you. And fill you with spiritual blessings. To live together in this life.
- Do not give it.<eos> - Thanks, Tom.<eos> I did not expect it.<eos> Janus life today.<eos> You never know what the tide will bring.<eos> Anything from both oceans is launched against us.<eos> Everything you can imagine.<eos> We can not hear, boy.<eos> ¿Hey, order?<eos> Many of you have ... His siblings, children and parents who did not return from the war.
Set a course for London, Harper.<eos> Our work here is done.<eos> Splice the mainbrace, lads!<eos> We're going home!<eos> Captain ashore!<eos> Captain.<eos> Mother!<eos> Here you are... finally.<eos> Miss Kingsleigh?<eos> You and The Wonder have been expected for over a year.
So... Hamish tells me you've traveled the world, these last three years.<eos> Yes. I've just returned.<eos> Well, then... how was it?<eos> The world?<eos> Highly enjoyable.<eos> You should visit it, sometime.<eos> Apologies for the intrusion, lord Ascot... but I've come to give my report.<eos> Of course.<eos> Follow me, Miss Kingsleigh.<eos> And you, Mr. Harcourt.
The world has opened to us, but we must move quickly.<eos> It is my belief that further expeditions along the Wu river...<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Kingsleigh.<eos> There will be no further expeditions.<eos> What?<eos> Now... there is a position in our clerking office.<eos> You will start in files, but in time...<eos> This isn't about China, is it?<eos> It's because I turned you down, when you asked me to marry you.<eos> I am sorry, Miss Kingsleigh... but this is all that we can do for you.
Correction.<eos> He gave them to your mother... who sold them to me a year ago, while you were gone... along with the bond on the house.<eos> Her house?<eos> The bond we will redeem against your ship.<eos> But that was my father's ship.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Sign over the vessel... and you will redeem the house.<eos> Report to work Monday morning... and you will receive a salary and a pension.<eos> And give up The Wonder?<eos> Otherwise, we cannot help you... or your mother.
But, I need it.<eos> Without it, the Hatter may never get better... and I have to...<eos> Wilkins?<eos> Wilkins!<eos> Stupid door.<eos> Did you call, sir?<eos> Wilkins, please remove this... yellow-haired kindergartener, here.<eos> Immediately, sir!<eos> No interlopers!<eos> Thank you for your you, sir.
I merely said I had invited her.<eos> Very good.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Well played, sir.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were asking me before, when "soon", is?<eos> Let me try to explain when is, now, all right?<eos> Now is... Exactly one minute till tea time.<eos> And until the young Alice joins you for tea... it will always remain one minute till tea time... For you and your... Dunderheads.
Anyone?<eos> They're not here?<eos> They're not here.<eos> They're not here.<eos> But I was certain that they were here. I...<eos> I could feel it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Father?<eos> Mother!<eos> Everyone, it's you!
They're not here?<eos> They're not here.<eos> They're not here.<eos> But I was certain that they were here. I...<eos> I could feel it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Father?<eos> Mother!<eos> Everyone, it's you!<eos> Teeny-tiny you, but still you.
Gotta save the Grand Clock.<eos> I won't leave you!<eos> Sir, sir! Hold on, sir!<eos> She's here!<eos> Ze girl who tricked you, und made you look a complete idiot!<eos> Alice!<eos> Hatter!<eos> Goodbye, brother.<eos> Brother, goodbye.<eos> I have cherished every moment with all of you.
You only get the one.<eos> Oh, Hatter.<eos> I fear I may never see you again.<eos> My dear Alice.<eos> In the gardens of memory... in the palace of dreams... that is where you and I will meet.<eos> But a dream is not reality.<eos> Who's to say which is which?<eos> You did it, Alice.<eos> An impossible thing.<eos> Not as impossible as saying goodbye to you, my friends.
We should have...<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - Don't you touch me, Doc!<eos> - Put it down!<eos> Christian!<eos> - You put it down!<eos> Look at me. Just cause you think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.<eos> You listen to me, Doc.<eos> You're gonna regret it.<eos> All of you!
- Hey, hey!<eos> - Don't you touch me, Doc!<eos> - Put it down!<eos> Christian!<eos> - You put it down!<eos> Look at me. Just cause you think you should be in charge, doesn't make it so.<eos> You listen to me, Doc.<eos> You're gonna regret it.<eos> All of you!<eos> All of you!
You are the woman she would've been.<eos> No.<eos> You are so much better than I ever could be.<eos> I let this happen.<eos> I was weak.<eos> - You cannot afford to be. - Time is running out, Alice.<eos> Ah, how touching.<eos> The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.<eos> Not that it'll do you any good.<eos> I've been ahead of you every step of the way.
Stay with us after the break...<eos> What, did the Ranch put this out? No.<eos> This is something else.<eos> Thank you, Levi.<eos> What you do now will decide our whole way of life.<eos> You have four days to get the boy back here.<eos> He won't give him up easily.<eos> But we must get him back in time, you understand?<eos> The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.<eos> Peace be to you.
- Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Al.<eos> I decoded the same patterns you found in the sermons.<eos> They know where you're going.<eos> Everything will be blocked off for 5 miles.<eos> You won't get through.<eos> I can help.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I come with you?
The Iron Way is not legend... not yet.<eos> I'm telling you, I'm good for it.<eos> You are good for nothing.<eos> We're good for your warrant.<eos> I have 30 swords at 20 ounces of silver a head.<eos> That's... six hundred ounces of silver...<eos> Sir Te was honored by masters of pen and sword alike.<eos> If his house has need, men of the Iron Way should heed for the honor of his cause, not promise of riches.<eos> My friend is right.<eos> This warrant is not for you.
I will fall silent.<eos> How can you fall silent and yet give a word?<eos> How can you hold so much wine and not smile?<eos> This is territory allied to the Red Desert clan.<eos> We have cut off their supply.<eos> Come the New Moon, West Lotus will own this entire territory.<eos> But this is merely Lingbao.<eos> Not Peking.<eos> Mantis will go where an army cannot.<eos> While you soldiers will gather at the Twin Rivers and prepare for war against all rival clans in the Martial World.
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk,<eos> United Federation of Planets.<eos> I'm appearing before you as a neutral representative of the Fobonane Republic.
I insist.<eos> Lieutenant Uhura, open the shipwide channel.<eos> Yes, Captain.<eos> Attention, crew of the Enterprise.<eos> Our mission is straightforward.<eos> Rescue a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space.<eos> Our trajectory will take us through a unstable nebula, a one which will disable all communications with Starfleet.<eos> We're going to be on our own.<eos> The Enterprise has something no other ship in the fleet has.<eos> You.
I have the Abronath.<eos> Secure the ship.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Go, Spock.<eos> I have identified the individual who appears to be leading the attack party.<eos> He infiltrated the archive vault and removed the artifact from our mission on Teenax.<eos> Hold your distance until we...<eos> Spock!<eos> Spock!<eos> You two with me.
Want to see?<eos> I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn, so Saint Peter can hear me when it's time to open the Gate.<eos> You hear that?<eos> You hear that?<eos> That's the hellhound.<eos> I'm gonna chase them out of here.<eos> Go on!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Get out!<eos> All you hypocrite members.
I could sit up in her house and laugh.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.<eos> It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.<eos> Rose, I... I can't give that up.<eos> Well, maybe you ought to go on and stay down there with her, if she's a better woman than me.<eos> It ain't about nobody being a better woman, or nothing.<eos> Rose, you ain't to blame. A man couldn't ask for a better wife than you've been.<eos> I'm responsible for it.<eos> I done locked myself into a pattern, trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.<eos> They don't know if they're gonna let him out or not.<eos> I talked to them a little while ago.<eos> A corporal in the United States Marines.<eos> Your daddy knew you had it in you.<eos> He used to tell me all the time.<eos> Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?<eos> Yeah, he reminds me of Troy when I first met him.<eos> Say, Rose, Lucille's down at the church with the choir.<eos> I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up. I'll be back to get you all.
Just needs a little nudge, right direction.<eos> She's yours.<eos> It's a done deal.<eos> You've got the SEC in your pocket, Mike.<eos> Thanks a million.<eos> Self-made aviation tycoon Mike Regan, is taking his private jet business to an even higher altitude.<eos> The latest development, Regan is taking his company public.<eos> So will investors bite?<eos> This is Marketplace, I'm Kai Ryssdal.<eos> Here's one for you, Mike Regan, a 52-year old owner of the private jet business that bears his name is about to take his company public.
It changes you.<eos> You're not fixed on the ground like some rock.<eos> You're as free as you'll ever be.<eos> But it's expensive, isn't it?<eos> I'm gonna take this business and blow it up and invent a new one.<eos> Let me show you the future.<eos> Private aviation.<eos> What if it could be made even more efficient?<eos> What if your investment could be put to work for you?<eos> What if there was a way to make your jet work for you?
I worked myself silly.<eos> Okay, number one.<eos> You work your ass off to get what you want.<eos> Number two.<eos> You do not let other people drag you down.<eos> 'Cause they will.<eos> They are an anchor in your life that you do not want.<eos> Cut 'em loose and sail off.<eos> If you work this program...<eos> You.
- The tech guys?<eos> You think Pam did all the tech guys?<eos> The lowest, weirdest, saddest guys!<eos> That's who Pam fucked!<eos> Go to hell, Michelle! Go to hell!<eos> When I get to hell, I'll tell Pam that you said hello, 'cause she's probably down there fucking IT guys.<eos> Weird little guys, carrying wires around in weird hats.<eos> That's who she's fucking in hell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't need you.
Or what did you have planned, Sandy?<eos> Well, actually, we were gonna build a dirty badger nest in a tree.<eos> My God.<eos> My God!<eos> And I was making that up.<eos> I was trying to think of the worst possible scenario on Earth.<eos> What the hell is going on in here?<eos> I leave the room for one minute to talk to my landscaper and the meeting goes into the toilet?<eos> Sorry, Helen, we're almost done.<eos> Okay, you guys, the best part about Darnell's Darlings is that, for each box sold, an extra 10% will go into a college fund for you.
Now, what are we doing?<eos> Selling brownies!<eos> Okay, what do we say if somebody doesn't want to buy?<eos> "Buy my brownies or I'll kill you."<eos> Don't say that, Chrystal.<eos> Say that.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> All right, now go make some money!<eos> The van leaves at 7:00!<eos> If you're not back, we will leave without you!
Okay.<eos> Claire, if this company is going to work, I need you full time.<eos> I can't have you here.<eos> Are you in or are you out?<eos> I can't just leave my job!<eos> I mean, I have to have a steady income.<eos> I have Rachel to think about.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is for Rachel. Okay?<eos> If this works out the way I know it's going to work out, it's gonna set you two up for life.
Let's get a shot of those.<eos> Huh, pretty good stuff, right?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, amazing!<eos> This is Chrystal. It's one of the Darnell originals.<eos> She's a giant.<eos> I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I have eyes.<eos> Isn't that fun?<eos> Come on with me.<eos> I got a surprise for all of you guys... I think you're gonna be very excited about.
- Didn't have to.<eos> Didn't have to make it that weird.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - Language!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> This is all seeming probably so much stranger than what I had intended.<eos> I'm sorry to startle you, Rachel.<eos> What are you doing in my closet?<eos> Well, uh, to give you the whole...<eos> I thought I have a great idea to surprise you with an apology, and my sincere "I'm sorry."
I just wanna say what a great first year for the Darnell's Darlings.<eos> And what a great first house for Rachel and Claire.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Finally, they have a decent guestroom so I can stay over when I get blasted.<eos> - Michelle.<eos> - What's "blasted"?<eos> I'll show you in about three drinks.<eos> - No, she won't.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> But if I can, can I take a serious note for a minute, and I just wanna say I'm proud of you.
Let's go! Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> Huh?<eos> Who are we?<eos> Who are we?<eos> We are the Flushed Pets...<eos> Thrown away by our owners and now we are out for revenge!<eos> It's like a club, but with biting and scratching.<eos> Take us with you!
We are the Flushed Pets...<eos> Thrown away by our owners and now we are out for revenge!<eos> It's like a club, but with biting and scratching.<eos> Take us with you!<eos> I don't think so, pets.<eos> Yeah, you got the stench of domestication all over you.<eos> You chose your side. And now you're gonna burn. No!<eos> Stop! Who you calling "pets"?<eos> I ain't no pet! You got it all wrong!<eos> We're just like you guys.
Holy schnitzel!<eos> Getting a weird vibe, man.<eos> All right, now, these guys are a bit testy. So, just let me do the talking.<eos> Hey, you crybaby! Where's the Viper at?<eos> Don't you worry, Viper! You will not be forgotten!<eos> You will be avenged, Viper!<eos> If you don't believe me, you can look at my battle plans. It's all laid out right here.<eos> Uh, boss... I can't tell who anyone is.<eos> Well, you gotta really look at it to understand it.<eos> That's you guys right here. And, see, that's Brooklyn.
Not good!<eos> See you guys later!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Everybody, run!<eos> Derick, you idiot!<eos> Did they all get away?<eos> That was a close one!<eos> Oh, nuts!<eos> Yes! We got one!<eos> Oh, good for you guys!
That's what happened.<eos> That is not a good look, mate.<eos> Leaving a damsel in distress while you take off like road runner...<eos> What do you know about me?<eos> Man. Relax.<eos> I'm just messing with you.<eos> I'm sure you had your reasons. Yeah.<eos> Like being a fucking pussy.<eos> Alright, enough!<eos> All of you.
Nice and easy.<eos> Nice bit of synchronized footwork.<eos> - Miss Tilton.<eos> - Be careful, all right?<eos> Ok, let's see it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Years of ballet training.<eos> Very nimble.<eos> - Show us what you got.<eos> I'll show you boys how it's really done.
Show me what you got.<eos> This way.<eos> Hartmann...<eos> I want you to cut its throat.<eos> Look, it's not easy to take a life, but sometimes it's the only thing between you and survival.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Great.<eos> We just killed Bambi.<eos> I give thanks to this beautiful creature whose life we have taken.<eos> And to this land and also to all of you.

You mean, that leaves me potentially bankrupt and you potentially unemployed?<eos> Well, let's not get melodramatic here, Bobby.<eos> There are always solutions.<eos> Westcom said no, Marcos.<eos> Unless I can find 250 million...<eos> The merger's dead in the water, ransom or not.<eos> Call me back when you hear from Oshimoto.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Same as the rest of you.
No one's gonna cut you down now.<eos> You ready to go, Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Come on, Grace.<eos> Not again.<eos> I'm just settling a score.<eos> One for Jack. One for you? Yeah.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Aren't you two supposed to be getting hitched? Yep!
- Anything but the Grizz!<eos> You go in there, you don't come out!<eos> I'm gonna meet my gator-maker!<eos> Nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So where's the mastiff?<eos> It didn't come together.<eos> Didn't come together?<eos> What is this, a jigsaw puzzle?<eos> A standard kidnapping is too much for you two?
Hedges funds.<eos> - Just keep doing sexy eyes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Keep doing sexy eyes.<eos> I like Alice.<eos> And she's smart, she's funny, she's weird.<eos> We invite these girls to the wedding, suddenly we're not losers.<eos> We're winners!<eos> Here they come. They're coming.<eos> Hey, uh, this might sound crazy... But our little sister is getting married in Hawaii... And we wanted to know if you guys wanted to come with.
I don't think it's gonna take all weekend.<eos> Am I right?<eos> So, you guys are cousins?<eos> She's been jealous of me since I was a little kid.<eos> What could I possibly be jealous of?<eos> Your outfit looks like Jimmy buffet's dust ruffle.<eos> Do you guys always do this?<eos> Okay, this is actually a very fashion-forward outfit.<eos> No, you look like the wallpaper from a long John silver's bathroom.<eos> Cool. I'm gonna hit the buffet now... While you guys do whatever it is you're doing.
Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You are beautiful!<eos> On to Seattle!<eos> Alice?<eos> Am I glowing?<eos> I can see sounds and hear colors.<eos> Be free!<eos> What the fuck are the horses doing out?<eos> Who the fuck are you guys?
Just tell me the truth.<eos> Are you on drugs?<eos> We're super fucked up.<eos> Yeah. What?<eos> We started with ecstasy, but then I went into my mystery bags.<eos> Why the fuck would you do that?<eos> Don't you judge me, David.<eos> I don't think you're supposed to go into the mystery bag... The night before the wedding.<eos> We brought you here because we thought you were nice girls.<eos> But Mike was right about you two.
We can't let you not get married just because we fucked everything up.<eos> We love you so much, jeanie.<eos> We love you, Eric.<eos> We just want you guys to love each other.<eos> - Just love each other.<eos> - That's it.<eos> Jeanie, Eric.<eos> We can't let you not get married.<eos> Yeah. Just because we fucked everything up?<eos> I mean, we want you guys to love each other.
Fuck yes!<eos> I'll get you guys a venue.<eos> Keith, get it together.<eos> We need to move, move, move.<eos> L'm doing my best.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> And now... A reading... From the children's book that I got in the lobby.<eos> - Oh. -"Aloha moon.<eos> "Aloha sea.<eos> "Aloha you.
I want you all to look.<eos> I want you all to remember.<eos> This was a nun.<eos> A few months shy of her 80th birthday.<eos> A nun.<eos> He did this... to a nun.<eos> We all know the book of Matthew.<eos> We all know what Jesus did.<eos> He called his twelve disciples to him and he gave them the authority to cast out evil spirits.<eos> Well, today, each and every one of you has that same authority.
I'm innocent!<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Got one last visitor here for you.<eos> Johnny, this is our last chance to talk.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Johnny, please.<eos> Get gone!<eos> We're assembled here today to witness the execution of Johnny frank Garrett, sentenced to death by lethal injection for the murder of sister tadea benz.<eos> Have you got anything you want to say to us right now, son?<eos> I would like to tell you all for a final time that I am innocent...

Haven't been sleeping well.<eos> Well, if you ever need someone to talk to, you know where I am.<eos> I have been charged, convicted, sentenced and more than punished for rape and murder.<eos> And a lot of real bad stuff has been said about me that, if given the chance,<eos> I could have proven not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt of my innocence.<eos> But you, society, did not give me a chance to do so.<eos> I never really went to school, as you did.<eos> I didn't learn to read there, as you did. I learned at home.<eos> And because of that, I spent over half my life in juvenile and adult institutions, detention centers, halfway houses, state schools, jails with grown men, all before my 19th birthday.<eos> You people... I despise every one of you, from the government to the ignorant judge and jury.
CHAIRMAN DREK:<eos> Esteemed citizens of Quartu, I stand before you a proud Blarg, for tonight, we will twist the very fabric of reality.
Cora Veralux!<eos> You loved him in Grapplemania, you'll love him more as a Galactic Ranger.<eos> Get ready to feel the pain of Brax "The Brute" Lectrus!<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> And finally, ladies and gentlemen, the savior of Solana, Captain Qwark!<eos> Hello, Veldin!<eos> Hello, Captain!<eos> He's on fire again. I know.<eos> My name is Copernicus Qwark, and yes, that was an impressive wall of fire I just walked past.<eos> I'm going to be real with you folks for a moment.
How did you not see this coming?<eos> And Victor!<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> Do you know how many candidates you beat out for your position?<eos> I could have hired the Zeezils Brothers!<eos> It's enough to make me want to vaporize someone!<eos> We're putting our project on hold.<eos> I'm ordering all remaining warbots to the Deplanetizer until the heat dies down.<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> Before we make any rash decisions, I wonder if you'd permit me to troubleshoot this for you.
Well, I might be a little crazy, but not that crazy.<eos> So, New York City.<eos> My goodness, I love New York.<eos> Yeah, it's just...<eos> It's really lonely on the road, isn't it, Max?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't you come with us, Aunt Daisy?<eos> - That's a great idea, Max.<eos> - Isn't that a great idea? No.<eos> I can't go with you guys to New York.
Do you know this is the first road trip I ever took?<eos> My first road trip.<eos> I gotta say, I'm having a heck of a time.<eos> All right, well, half hour to sunrise.<eos> Frank!<eos> Why don't you just put the mustache back on and come with us to New York?<eos> Can't do it, Max.<eos> Can't do it.<eos> You could mastermind Alcatraz, but you couldn't mastermind us.<eos> Nobody could mastermind you two.
- Yeah, Jake.<eos> - Coma.<eos> - Hey, Alex Brumley. - Hey, man.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nesbit.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Go get some glasses, Brumley.<eos> Yeah, sure thing, dude.<eos> Is...<eos> Wait, Jay Niles isn't with you guys?
- Thanks, man.<eos> - Have fun, boys. Hey, shake something, don't break something.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Hey, hey, guys. - Yeah? If you guys want more beer, go to Howard.<eos> The guy that looks like Cheech. We're getting all this shit for free, okay?<eos> Dude!<eos> No cover and free beer.<eos> College is the fucking greatest!<eos> Hey, it's part of the scholarship.<eos> Say goodbye to your high school sweethearts, fellas. The wonderful world of college pussy is upon you.
So, what you want me to do?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Just do the right thing, you know?<eos> Give me the room alone for a bit.<eos> You know, man, but my girlfriend, she lives out of town, right?<eos> So what, you want me to just pitch a tent on the couch all the time, or what?<eos> Not all the time. Just this little window of time.<eos> - Little window?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, come on, man, you guys are already breaking the alcohol rule.
Yes.<eos> I mean, look, you can play an E pentatonic scale at 100 miles an hour till somebody's ears burn off, you can learn that, right?<eos> But finding the tangents within the framework, therein lies the artistry, man.<eos> You know, a fucking bunch of dudes jump around on stage, jerking each other off, you know, in spandex, isn't fucking music.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I kinda like Van Halen.<eos> Well, yeah, Plum, you do. And you know why you do?<eos> Because corporate America is shoving something down your throat and making you believe it, because that's what they want you to believe. I mean, guys, it's about finding out who you are in the space in-between the notes that they're offering you.<eos> I mean, you gotta tune in, man. You gotta tune in.<eos> You know, and don't be afraid to let the experience find you.
- Sir, no, sir.<eos> Good!<eos> Then don't.<eos> I'll give you freshmen a little advice on how to get your shit together, okay?<eos> You're at a new level here.<eos> You're pissing in the tall grass with the big dick dogs now.<eos> Hell, you got 21, 22-year-old guys over there who, at this stage, see you as someone trying to take their position.<eos> But what you limp cocks don't seem to realize is that you have not earned teammate status yet.<eos> And until you do, you're nobody.<eos> And not only do those guys not give a fuck about you, they would love to watch every single one of you fail.
You know, very confident..."<eos> You know what, if I had a prohibition against sleeping with all women who believed in astrology, I'd still be a virgin, all right?<eos> I'm being practical.<eos> I'd rather die a virgin than say my chart says I'll make a good father someday.<eos> Just because you guys are laying bricks with the ladies, you know, I stepped up.<eos> I was talking her language, I was meeting her on her level.<eos> Instead of making fun of me, you should be taking notes.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And by the way, she was really fucking cute.<eos> She was really fucking cute, and you immature jerkoffs just fucked up my whole rap!
- Yes, that's correct.<eos> - And no furniture?<eos> No, the house came furnished.<eos> - You need me to sign somewhere?<eos> - Um... oh, yes please.<eos> Here and here, if you would.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We'll get started.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You guys almost done?
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.<eos> Darling, I've forgotten your name.<eos> Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?<eos> I am... doing... just...<eos> Fine?<eos> ...as well as... I can... be.<eos> - What...<eos> - Hang in there.<eos> ...can I...<eos> - I was hoping you could run a for you...
Savage?<eos> This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps.<eos> Animals don't "go savage."<eos> I thought so, too, until I saw this.<eos> What?<eos> He was right here.<eos> The "savage" jaguar?<eos> Sir, I know what I saw.<eos> He almost killed us!<eos> Or, maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits.
- Badge!<eos> No.<eos> What did you say, fox?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What I said was, "no."<eos> She will not be giving you that badge.<eos> Look, you give her a clown vest and a three-wheeled joke-mobile... and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No wonder she needed to get help from a fox.<eos> None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?
You laid it all out beautifully.<eos> What?<eos> Are you looking for the serum?<eos> Well, it's right here.<eos> What you've got in the weapon there?<eos> Those are blueberries.<eos> From my family's farm.<eos> They are delicious.<eos> You should try some.<eos> I framed Lionheart. I can frame you, too.
Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated... than a slogan on a bumper sticker.<eos> Real life is messy<eos> We all have limitations.<eos> We all make mistakes.<eos> Which means, hey, glass half-full, we all have a lot in common.<eos> And the more we try to understand one another... the more exceptional each of us will be.<eos> But we have to try<eos> So, no matter what type of animal you are... from the biggest elephant... to our first fox... I implore you... try<eos> Try to make the world a better place.<eos> Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.
The women in the village heard a noise.<eos> Like the sky cracked open.<eos> He came down. Then came fire.<eos> Even worse came after.<eos> The government attacked.<eos> No mercy in the villages.<eos> My parents tried to run.<eos> The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do that no one has asked what he should do.<eos> Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible.<eos> He'll never answer to you.
We suspected it might have bio-interactions, so we took the sample to AMRIID,<eos> where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent.<eos> And, when we exposed General Zod to the mineral, this happened.<eos> Profound biodegradation. Decaying Kryptonian cells.<eos> We concluded the mineral could be weaponized if a large enough sample was found.<eos> And then, among the fishes, a whale.<eos> Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.<eos> Emerald City.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Now, Rocky is radioactive, but what he needs from you is an import license.
He made it for me to help me be happier.<eos> Oh, honey, you don't need a list for that.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Okay, I'm having a New Year's Eve Party, for one thing.<eos> You should definitely come.<eos> Also, you should call up that bad boy from the paper and give him the bang of his life.<eos> He'll leave that twit he's with, and you'll never be lonely again.<eos> Do you seriously think that?<eos> It's not your job to be everyone's moral guardian.<eos> If you like the guy, that's between you and him.
The kids have got stuff on.<eos> I've got work on.<eos> And...<eos> And I've got to think about Max.<eos> Max!<eos> Max. Why's it always about Max?<eos> Emily, he's fucked you over.<eos> Why can't you see that?<eos> Don't be like that, Jake.<eos> It's not a competition between you two.
Wait, listen to me, Mom.<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom.<eos> Fuck.<eos> All right, thank you.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> And here, listen, yeah...<eos> Here, look...<eos> I will...<eos> I will sort you out, all right?
Okay, kids, come on.<eos> Come on, we're going to go now.<eos> Come with me.<eos> A siege is now developing here in southwest London.<eos> The rugby captain, former England rugby captain Max Moore<eos> - is armed with a shotgun... - Max, put down the gun and pick up the phone!<eos> That's right.<eos> Max!<eos> Please pick up the phone!<eos> I ain't fucking talking to none of you pussyholes until I fucking see my wife.
Jerico!<eos> He's got Emma.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Give me the flash drive.<eos> Emma, run!<eos> What are the coordinates down there?<eos> I have a... little souvenir for them.<eos> - Quaker!<eos> Heimdahl just fired one of our cruise missiles 60 miles north of you.
So, first that Frau Gerda Kleinschmidt. Ugh.<eos> Then there's a Frau Else Wernicke who just lives round the corner, then‒ ah, listen to this:<eos> Claire Gehrich.<eos> Ah, she's the wife of Obersturmbannführer Gehrich.<eos> You have to be really diplomatic if you visit her.<eos> - Should I cross her out? - No, no, we can't do that.<eos> We all have to do our part but, uh, perhaps not today.<eos> We have to be in good shape for someone like that.<eos> What a nice place.<eos> What can I do for you?
Barkhausen, what are you doing in this apartment?<eos> Herr Persicke.<eos> Neighbor, we can share.<eos> It's Frau Rosenthal.<eos> Please, it's not my fault. Out.<eos> Look for the money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no need to be.<eos> You can stay with us.<eos> This is too dangerous for you.
There were no cards here at first, but now he doesn't want to travel so far and leaves more and more cards in his own neighborhood.<eos> Heil Hitler, Standartenführer.<eos> How many?<eos> He also includes the eastern districts and downtown.<eos> Here, look.<eos> I asked you a question, Escherich.<eos> How many?<eos> 127, Standartenführer. 129, to be exact with these two from this morning.<eos> More than 100!<eos> If more than 100 cards were turned in here, doesn't any one of you wise asses ever think about how much filth is still circulating out there?
Thank you. - Get out.<eos> - God bless you. Thank you very much.<eos> Bravo.<eos> You did what?<eos> You let your Hobbygobby go?<eos> Hobgoblin, Standartenführer.<eos> With due respect, you may be my superior, but as a member of the SS, you're not necessarily a criminalist.<eos> I'm a policeman, and I'm asking you to let me do my job just as I have learned from my experience‒<eos> Experience?<eos> I know all about guys like you.
Intellectuals, wise guys.<eos> Don't mess up my floor!<eos> Swallow your damn blood!<eos> Up!<eos> Up! Up, up, up, up, up!<eos> Come.<eos> You think you're clever, huh?<eos> And we're just the guys from the SS who don't have a clue, right?<eos> Say it. I want to hear it.<eos> "I'm smarter than you guys."
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.<eos> Mowgli, go back to the den!<eos> A man-cub belongs with man.<eos> We raised him as one of our own!<eos> - He'll have the boy, either way.<eos> Maybe I can be of help.<eos> The boy's right.<eos> Maybe it's time he found another people.<eos> - No.<eos> -I'm the one who brought him to you.
I came up here without an invitation.<eos> It was extremely presumptuous of me.<eos> Let me interrupt myself.<eos> I just gotta say... You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.<eos> No one ever gets up close to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the smell.<eos> The smell is rough.<eos> But it's not just, "oh, look at me."<eos> It's, "Igot the brains." You guys got the know-how.
But it's not just, "oh, look at me."<eos> It's, "Igot the brains." You guys got the know-how.<eos> You got the noggin.<eos> You came up with this stuff, with the thumb.<eos> Come on, show me.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.<eos> But I was hoping, and you may not be open to this at all... But I was hoping, and once again, it's a dream... But I was hoping that I might become...<eos> Gosh, I wanna be like you.
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.<eos> You've been shopping?<eos> Professor, you bumped your head?<eos> In the shower, yes. Yes. It was quite a tumble.<eos> I'm sorry, this is Sienna, my niece.<eos> You're in Italy, professor. You don't have to say "niece."<eos> - No, it's not...<eos> - No, he's not...<eos> Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Is Ignazio with you again?
You think this was the spirit?<eos> This Bill Wilkins?<eos> I tracked down the home owner. And it turns out, the owner's father lived there.<eos> His name was William Wilkins and he died of a hemorrhage in the brain in that chair.<eos> Everything she said is true.<eos> All public information, by the way.<eos> She could have heard the whole story from a neighbor.<eos> And what about the claims that Janet has been teleporting around the house in her sleep?<eos> About as valid as their claims of her levitating off the bed.<eos> Were any of you there when it happened?
They got us an Elvis record!<eos> Oh, Blue Hawaii.<eos> Hope you don't mind.<eos> A little American culture.<eos> Not at all!<eos> - Janet!<eos> - Billy.<eos> I missed you.<eos> Hey, guys, I missed you.<eos> So, have any of you ever been bothered by a bully?
It's over.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> For the sake of your daughter, don't make this harder than it already is.<eos> She couldn't have pulled this off alone.<eos> Oh, how dare you.<eos> What, you think I put her up to this?<eos> What about the police?<eos> Are they in on this, too?<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> What about you two?
- Yeah, sure. How are you doing?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> - I've been a bit spaced out.<eos> - Oh. Because of Marianne?<eos> She took off with a singing teacher.<eos> The High C, we called him.<eos> I shot blanks, so she moved on.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> What a load of crap. Living with you guys is a fun idea.

And I like him.<eos> - Would you like wine?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hi. Steff, I write in my article that the end product of anarchy must be order.<eos> - Anarchy says no one rules over anyone. - Hi, everybody. I'll have a beer.<eos> So go ahead and write that.<eos> - Do we have an agenda?<eos> - Sure.<eos> The How-Are-We-Doing Round.<eos> It gives me a rush to wake up every day in this fantastic house with all of you loonies running around.

I haven't seen you in weeks.<eos> - You look tired.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> We're living at the school. It's tough.<eos> Sure. Of course.<eos> But I... well...<eos> I miss you.<eos> I really do, and I know I shouldn't say it.<eos> - But I do. - It's okay to say it.<eos> I can't imagine life without the two of you but I know it won't work.
I really do love her.<eos> Can't she... stay at our place for a while?<eos> Sure, I guess...<eos> Well, maybe...<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> - Mads and Kirsten live like that.<eos> - True. - She can't live with us.<eos> - Well, live...<eos> At the moment we're all somehow living together anyway.<eos> There should be room for you too.
This is my house.<eos> I've lived here since I was a boy.<eos> You don't tell me how to live my life.<eos> This is my house!<eos> You gave this house to all of us.<eos> - Did we ever get the paperwork?<eos> - No, we didn't pay for it.<eos> - So technically it's Erik's house.<eos> - Why didn't we get the paperwork?<eos> Because only half of you have paid for your share!
- Boom, too.<eos> - Boom.<eos> - Yeah, boom.<eos> - Well... we won't get anywhere then.<eos> - No, we won't.<eos> You have to sort this out among yourselves.<eos> We can't bloody well vote out someone we love.<eos> You have to sort it out.<eos> That's what we're trying to tell you.<eos> Sort it out among the two of you... or three.
You attacked me.<eos> I come a long way.<eos> I wanna train with Tong Po.<eos> I wanna train with Master Po.<eos> Put it back.<eos> And the money.<eos> You know what, keep it.<eos> - All of it?<eos> You need it more than I do.<eos> You fighters from around the world have been invited to train with Master Po. And witness the impossible.
I wanna train with Master Po.<eos> Put it back.<eos> And the money.<eos> You know what, keep it.<eos> - All of it?<eos> You need it more than I do.<eos> You fighters from around the world have been invited to train with Master Po. And witness the impossible.<eos> Now, you might think that Master Po has run out of the unthinkable.<eos> But he'd like to challenge himself and stay creative.<eos> And continue to inspire you all with an infinite imagination.
One of those deaths occurred not so long ago.<eos> Right here on this spot.<eos> Another will occur today, right here.<eos> Let's meet the challenger!<eos> Kurt Sloane. The brother of the last man who died by Tong Po's hand.<eos> His fury over the death of his brother has led to one attempt at Tong Po's life.<eos> He wants revenge so much that he broke out of jail just to be here with us today and face his formidable enemy in mortal combat!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the undisputed champion of all champions... the man who defies the laws of physics.<eos> The man who is responsible for more than half the deaths in the ring in the last two years... usually in the first round.<eos> I give you... Tong Po!
Threw himself in the drink.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What is he to you?<eos> I'm a private investigator.<eos> Glad to know they still make those.<eos> Tom Soberin was using the Chase-Whitmore company card.<eos> You'd have to ask Borden about that.<eos> It's Chase-Whitmore in name only these days.<eos> My partner was Borden's old man.<eos> So Soberin wasn't working for you?
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They drug something out of the ground that night.<eos> Pushed so far down, it was like the earth got mad and let something bad out.<eos> But they say it was a pocket of gas, so I guess it was a pocket of gas, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do I know?<eos> Right?<eos> I left something on the bus.<eos> You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Where's mallorie?<eos> I think she's Internet shopping on her phone.<eos> My mind must be clear. I'm leaving you for good. No.<eos> You and the child are staying with me.<eos> She belongs here. She loves me. She loves me more than you and he ever did.<eos> She's gonna be the daughter you never were.<eos> Goodbye, mother.<eos> I call bullshit on skydiving.<eos> Uh, b.S. On being related to Diane Keaton.<eos> Okay, so you guys think it's true that I actually skinny-dipped with Zach galifianakis.
Which is a crime, might I add.<eos> Have you seen that man's face?<eos> Much as I appreciate the addition of some femininity to the group, over and above what Atlas provides, I think the real issue is we've been in this...<eos> Yeah, the issue is that we have been rehearsing for months for something... We don't even know what it is.<eos> And you're going to keep working until...<eos> Until we work as a single organism.<eos> I know, I've heard you say that.<eos> The thing is, when you say that, I think what you're referring to is us, not you.<eos> Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the Eye.<eos> Okay? And then I give them to you.
I know, I've heard you say that.<eos> The thing is, when you say that, I think what you're referring to is us, not you.<eos> Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the Eye.<eos> Okay? And then I give them to you.<eos> Now, if you don't like that, you're welcome to go.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...<eos> Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.<eos> Guys, can I just weigh in here really quickly?<eos> Because I think I see what's going on here.<eos> You guys are this amazing, tight-knit family unit.
Ladies and gentlemen, here are the Horsemen.<eos> Hello, New York!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Hey, it's great to be back.<eos> And have you met our newest Horseman, Lula?<eos> - Feels good, right?<eos> - Pretty good. Pretty good.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Um, okay. We want to talk to you about your privacy.<eos> What does your privacy mean to you?
Do you guys ever think that the Eye is watching this?<eos> You know, that maybe this is even what they want?<eos> And at the exact right moment, they're gonna swoop in, and we'll be like, "Yes!<eos> Thank God you're here!<eos> Thank God!<eos> Just in the nick of time, Eye!"<eos> And then we'll just celebrate, and it was all worth it in the end?<eos> I don't even really think that, either, so...<eos> It's cool.<eos> So happy to be working with you.
- Okay. All right.<eos> You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.<eos> That was very colorful.<eos> Almost eight and a half years ago.<eos> So, no need to bring that up.<eos> We can't all be held accountable for our adolescent personas.<eos> Can we, Magicolio?<eos> Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I love magic.<eos> Like you, and many others who, I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school, I dabbled with it.

Well, to start with, the man you stole from last year, turns out I had invested quite a lot of money in some of his companies, so a lot of what you stole was, in fact, mine.<eos> Good news is, it's very easy for you to pay me back.<eos> I just need your skills.<eos> Owen and I were like the Beatles, if the Beatles had been...<eos> Elfin?<eos> ...geniuses.<eos> Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.<eos> And like them, we had a dream.<eos> Could we create actual, genuine magic?<eos> And I'm guessing one of you achieved that dream, and it wasn't you?
And the pleasure?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Besides, why would I buy it when I could have you steal it for me?<eos> Oh! It's being previewed tomorrow to the various suitors, which will include your targets, a crew lead by a South African gangster.<eos> South African gangster.<eos> Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.<eos> But once you do, you just need to inspect it and steal it.<eos> That's it?<eos> Come on, this is perfect for you, isn't it?
We have each other and there are five of us.<eos> But we also need supplies, right? And resources.<eos> And probably more than five people.<eos> Do you really think you don't have help?<eos> Oh, she speaks English.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah. Do you know why the Fool is the most powerful card in the tarot?<eos> Not because the person who draws him is a fool.<eos> He's a fool because he's a clean slate, and, therefore, can become anything.<eos> You were chosen.

I have to go.<eos> Out of the way, FBI!<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Go! Get some men in that park!<eos> Men in the park, now!<eos> You gonna fill up on appetizers?<eos> Or save room for the main course?<eos> Where the hell are the Horsemen?<eos> You can chase them all you want, you're just gonna wind up holding your own tails.<eos> Or, you can let them come to you.
They should be arriving any second.<eos> That is, if they're gonna get here by midnight.<eos> Okay, feeling fear. Fear.<eos> Anger, anger.<eos> - Oh, full house!<eos> - That's enough.<eos> I was done.<eos> So nice to see you all again.<eos> But since we're such old friends, let's skip the formalities.<eos> One of you has something we require.
Wow!<eos> Thank you very much, London!<eos> We would like to acknowledge not just our old friend, Arthur Tressler. But his young and very brilliant son, Walter Mabry. Who has performed one of the greatest feats of illusion even we have ever seen.<eos> He has, amazingly, brought himself back from the dead!<eos> But before he did that, he revealed someone. And we think it only right to give him a proper introduction.<eos> He is our friend and he is our leader. Dylan Shrike!<eos> - Get over here!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> So, normally only the magician, his assistant, and a few trusted stage hands know the secret of a trick.<eos> But tonight, however, in this effect, all of you people around the Thames here. And since we're streaming live, everyone around the world already knows everything.
People don't just disappear.<eos> You realize that he doesn't actually have magical powers!<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Good to see you all.<eos> - Good to see you, Li.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I'm proud of you.

Y'all be quiet.<eos> Y'all know we got the FBI working on this.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good evening, folks.<eos> I'm Jebediah Woodley.<eos> That's right.<eos> I wanna talk to you a little bit about what's happened in town this past week.<eos> I know you're all frightened, as you should be but if you just cooperate and listen to what I got to say everybody's gonna be fine.<eos> Well, most of you are gonna be fine.

We'll get a chance to talk about this later. I know you aren't gonna believe some of the things I'm about to say.<eos> Some of you, well...
Well, look, just calm down now.<eos> I'm gonna explain it to you.<eos> I'm gonna explain what happened.<eos> See, there's...<eos> Just hear me out now. We'll get a chance to talk about this later. I know you aren't gonna believe some of the things I'm about to say.<eos> Some of you, well...<eos> Let me finish up.<eos> I'll explain it to you.<eos> There's something going on with this town...<eos> Some of you are gonna have a problem believing what I'm about to say now but I gotta tell you something.
That is, it takes a lot of strength to do what you do, friends.<eos> They should pat themselves on the back. You are soldiers.<eos> And do you know who else shares my opinion?<eos> His wives, his parents, his sons and daughters, And I think they should be able to call them.<eos> Have you ever used one of these?<eos> But if you can put yourself in the buyer's shoes, Wow! You are gold<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> They are under arrest.<eos> And then there are also people, you know, sometimes people in high places That you do not think they are in the market, And they are not until you find something they like.<eos> Okay, what we have for you, gentlemen, nothing short of extraordinary.
Thank you very much.<eos> They are under arrest.<eos> And then there are also people, you know, sometimes people in high places That you do not think they are in the market, And they are not until you find something they like.<eos> Okay, what we have for you, gentlemen, nothing short of extraordinary.<eos> We have monochrome LCD display, USB interface, 20 megabytes of built-in memory.<eos> Most importantly, your friends will be very impressed Just put their hands on them, so...<eos> Who did you steal this time?<eos> I know someone works for the watch company.<eos> I got them at a good price. How many have you got?<eos> Two for you.
Is that your... is that your name or your last name?<eos> Both of them.<eos> All right, Mr. Curtis, can you? Can you hang up the phone for a second, please?<eos> You have exactly one minute.<eos> Look, this was just a joke, okay? I was not trying to...<eos> I was not trying to steal anything.<eos> Your security system is atrocious.<eos> The firewall is outdated.<eos> The software I created Was able to put a virus in the system very easily.<eos> That is, it does not look good to you if an 18 year old Was able to break into the bank and steal all this information. That is, a bank like this should be safer.
- Good work, Sye.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> Do you have to be so rough on your face?<eos> These are my contacts.<eos> You're ruining all my contacts.<eos> What a waste of my time!<eos> Shit!<eos> That was a fucking mess.<eos> You need to get along, Or we all go by separate ways, Because I do not want to get shot,<eos> And I'm pretty sure neither of you.
We wanted to meet him.<eos> Did you want to meet me?<eos> What made them think they might get my attention?<eos> We had a plan that could bring a lot of money.<eos> Well, I do not care about the money, But I understand that many people do.<eos> So, why do they need me?<eos> We need a lot of resources.<eos> And the plan would not work without you.<eos> Good.<eos> Then, after they tell me, why do I need you?
Because with me... There will be no errors.<eos> Why did not you tell him something?<eos> There is no limit to what you can do.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I have a missed call from Sye.<eos> Hey, Alex, it's me.<eos> I just... I'm so sorry about the... The way things happened, and I just...<eos> I've been thinking a lot, and I really want a chance To sort things out with you and with Kira, Just go back to how things were.<eos> So, I went back to the hotel, and I'm here at the moment, And I'm just going to wait for them until they come back, so...<eos> Oh, maybe it's you right now.
Can we expect some market corrections, perhaps?<eos> No comment.<eos> To raise the market again...<eos> Shit, yes!<eos> They are ready?<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> - Start.<eos> We have a breaking news alert.<eos> We have breaking news live.<eos> We have an image for you.
Never mind that, Barker. I wanna see my father.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.<eos> Father, you're gonna wanna hear this.<eos> I've got something huge.<eos> Your brother and I are busy here, Langdon. Working on his election campaign. We don't have time for this.<eos> This is Mary Lou Barebone from the New Salem Preservation Society.<eos> And she's got a big story for you.<eos> Oh, she has, has she?<eos> There's strange things going on all over the city.<eos> The people behind this, they are not like you and me.
Same thing.<eos> Newt! No, don't.<eos> I'm so sorry. Good show, Mr. Kowalski.<eos> Call me Jacob.<eos> Well... Two down, one to go.<eos> In you hop. Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Tonight's keynote speaker needs no introduction from me.<eos> He's been mentioned as a future president.<eos> And if you don't believe me, just read his daddy's newspapers. Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> I give you the senator for New York, Henry Shaw. Thank you.
It's just a toy.<eos> What is this?<eos> Take it off.<eos> - Ma...<eos> - I am not your ma.<eos> Your mother was a wicked, unnatural woman.<eos> It was mine.<eos> Modesty. What is this?<eos> Demiguise are fundamentally peaceful, but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.<eos> You two, head that way.
- Credence. - Credence. No!<eos> You fools.<eos> Do you realize what you've done?<eos> The Obscurial was killed on my orders, Mr. Graves.<eos> Yes.<eos> And history will surely note that, Madam President.<eos> What was done here tonight was not right.<eos> He was responsible for the death of a No-Maj. He risked the exposure of our community. He has broken one of our most sacred laws.<eos> A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter. A law that demands that we conceal our true nature. A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear, lest we risk discovery.<eos> I ask you, Madam President, I ask all of you... Who does this law protect?
When will he be back?<eos> Not sure.<eos> He's freelance, so it's hard... How 'bout Charley?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I always wanted a tattoo.<eos> No more arrests for the rest of the night.<eos> What's shakin'?<eos> Lemi K wants to see you.<eos> Now.<eos> You are supposed to be protecting me and my people.
This situation needs a scalpel, not a hammer.<eos> Please.<eos> Camilla, right?<eos> You're wasting your time. It's not gonna happen.<eos> I don't clock in for the Vatican.<eos> - What do you have against the Church?<eos> - How much time you got?<eos> Look, I just don't believe what I do belongs to any one religion.<eos> - Exorcising demons?<eos> - No, to you, it's a demon. To others, it's an unclean spirit, it's jinn, it's orisha. Take your pick, okay?
Say it... say it again.<eos> I forgive you, Dad.<eos> You do?<eos> I want it to be like it was.<eos> - Can it be like before?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It can be like before. Promise.<eos> I'm gonna clean up.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'll do anything for you.
Yeah.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Thank you. - Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - What do you got?<eos> - We got a break-in.<eos> One eyewit, this gentleman here.<eos> Sees male, undetermined race, goes in, comes out, runs down the street, gets into a cab.<eos> Anyone inside?<eos> Waiting on you.
Just..just junks.<eos> Ah, careful with that. Serious, Spark.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> You gonna..<eos> Aren't you supposed to be in bed?<eos> After an awesome birthday, you guys leaving me home alone to stare at the stars with the roaches?<eos> I guess I was too excited to sleep.<eos> Sorry, Spark.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore, I should be going a mission with you guys.
Over here!<eos> Leave my friend alone!<eos> Spark, no!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go now!<eos> Don't worry I've a chance so long as I have this.<eos> This will be gonna be more difficult.<eos> I can't look!<eos> Father, if I ever need your strength it's now.<eos> Back, all of you!
Your dumpster-diving child here together with a band of old has-been... and some bugs take on my army. Was that the idea?<eos> How priceless!<eos> You can't made that stuff up you really can't.<eos> Enjoy the front row seat to your own failure.<eos> All system, damage report!<eos> Engineering?<eos> The royal blunder ship isn't looking so good now is it?<eos> You and your father are so very much alike.<eos> Both of you failed so completely.<eos> Speaking of my brother, why didn't he come through the slick with the rest of you?
But your site does make it sound like a air safety consultancy business that's got about 100 employees, and headquarters in three states.<eos> And I dug a little deeper. Then I realise there's only you.<eos> You know, go easy.<eos> I'm just getting it going.<eos> I'm not usually accused been a bullshitter.<eos> Nah, don't get me wrong, actually it's a compliment.<eos> I found that website, I'll hire you.<eos> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Welcome onboard US Airways flight fifteen forty-nine service to Charlotte.<eos> Please read the safety instruction card in seatback pocket in front of you.
You'll be okay. All right, got you.<eos> Is anybody still here?<eos> Come forward.<eos> Captain, come back<eos> Come forward.<eos> You need to get off the plane now.<eos> Captain!<eos> Captain, we have to go.<eos> Let's get off the plane right now.<eos> All right, you guys go, I'll be right behind you.
I'll call you when they're done with me.<eos> - Sully.<eos> - Hey, Larry.<eos> - Good morning, Sully. - Jeff.<eos> All right, good moring, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome.<eos> My name is Charles Porter.<eos> I'm being asigned by National Transportation Safety Board... to conduct this public hearing here today.<eos> We have a lot of material to cover.<eos> But before we listen to the Cockpit Vocie Recording.<eos> We would be listening to what for the first time along with you gentlemen.
Hold on. Not even if I ply you with popcorn and sourpatch kids?<eos> - You're lucky you're cute.<eos> How do you get used to that?<eos> - You do and you don't.<eos> Sheriff?<eos> - Where's your dad?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Bring her back here, Sheldon.<eos> - Dad, if you need me to stay- oh, don't worry about it.<eos> You two go have your fun.
Box Command, this is Gulf One. Do you copy?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Looks like we're walking.<eos> Mr. President, those better be comfortable shoes.<eos> Sir, I think you're gonna wanna take a look at this.<eos> I'll put it up.<eos> To our friends in the West, whose idea of war is a remote dusty location thousands of miles from the comfort zone of your shopping malls, who send your poor to be blown to bits in our land or, better yet, murder our families remotely from the sky.<eos> Your time is over.<eos> We're bringing the war to you.
Sells arms to every failed state in the world.<eos> He has a vast array of connections.<eos> Terrorists, mercenaries, corporations.<eos> Mr. Vice President, it's Barkawi.<eos> Put him through.<eos> I thought you might take my call.<eos> You understand if I made it difficult to track.<eos> You have me at somewhat of a loss.<eos> I thought you would have learned a lesson by now about crawling out of your hole.<eos> I never lifted a finger against you.

We're live now. Okay-<eos> Say hello to the world, Mr. President.<eos> Any last words,<eos> Mr. President?<eos> I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> ...United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm not watching this.<eos> You know what you guys don't get?

We're not a fucking flag. We're not just one man.<eos> Assholes like you have been trying to kill us for a long fucking time.
Make your mind up, Chad.<eos> Poxy few grand.<eos> A man's allowed to have a stash.<eos> If that's all you got me on, I'm walking in no time.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> So you say you spent the whole evening with your son, Chad Cutler.<eos> We have spent the whole of every day of his life together.<eos> So, tell me, in as much detail as you can, what you did.<eos> Told you already.<eos> After I'd given him a bath, I put his jimjams on him and read him a bedtime story about how fucking stupid you lot are, and tucked him up in bed.
It's a very odd choice, given what he does.<eos> You did do your homework, didn't you, Chad?<eos> You do know what a lord lieutenant is, don't you?<eos> Well...<eos> Well, Chad, my friend, my little friend, a lord lieutenant... is the one up there who swears in all the judges.<eos> Do you know what that means, Chad?<eos> Mm? Do you?<eos> It means that every single policeman, magistrate, every traffic warden in this county will not rest until you're in jail.<eos> No, no, hear me out.<eos> Jesus died on the cross because of people like you.
I really need to use your bathroom, miss.<eos> - It's around back, darlin'.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Honey, ain't you forgetting' somethin'?<eos> You need a key.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Don't you be goin' and flushing' your bloody tampons down that toilet and leavin' 'em all which-away, you throw 'em in the goddamn trash, you hear?<eos> - Um, okay.<eos> - All you high school girls bleed like Dracula fucked
- Don't you be goin' and flushing' your bloody tampons down that toilet and leavin' 'em all which-away, you throw 'em in the goddamn trash, you hear?<eos> - Um, okay.<eos> - All you high school girls bleed like Dracula fucked<eos> Willy Wonka and formed a blood factory and slaughtered all those Oompa Loompas and made a buncha bloody Marys.<eos> Vagina Coyote Uglies.<eos> A lot of Draculas' wives went out on a night on the town and went to a bachelor party and all had their periods at the same time.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - Alright, you guys ready?
- Yeah, baby, choke me.<eos> Come on baby.<eos> Go easy, baby, not so tight.<eos> That was hot.<eos> You never got kinky like that, baby.<eos> - Are you on the rag?<eos> - Yeah, sorry.<eos> We've done it when I'm ragging before.<eos> - Not with me.<eos> - What can I do you for?
- What does your dad think about you leaving the Army?<eos> - Well, he doesn't know I left.<eos> He thinks I graduated, he even bought me a gun as a graduation present.<eos> Just really haven't had the heart to tell him I left.<eos> - Well, I'm sure he'll understand.<eos> - So, are you a cat or dog person?<eos> - Well, I love all animals, but since you're so eager to categorize me, I would have to say I'm a cat person.<eos> - Oh, lame.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, you cat people, you're just weird.
- Alright, sir, I'm gonna give you a count of three and then I'm gonna kick the door in.<eos> One.<eos> - Hold on, one minute.<eos> - Two.<eos> Three!<eos> What's goin' on in here?<eos> - Nothin' man, we were just sleepin'.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Sir, he's dead tired.<eos> Why are you guys so close together?
- Nothin' man, we were just sleepin'.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Sir, he's dead tired.<eos> Why are you guys so close together?<eos> - Um, we just finished, you know.<eos> - You guys from like California or something?<eos> - No, man, we're just headed towards the beach and we just stopped here for the night.<eos> - Yeah, well what happened to your head?<eos> - I got caught on a zipper?<eos> - Did you guys hear any other kind of noises or anything?
- Wake up!<eos> Pam?<eos> - Fuck me.<eos> - You've been fucked.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You know, it's a good night for America.<eos> - What?<eos> - Now, I don't know what you kids want here, but I like it.
- Down on the ground, sir. - I know my rights.<eos> - Down on the ground.<eos> - - Take me home.<eos> Thereyougo ,sir.<eos> Thankyouverymuch.<eos> Hey,hey! Whyyou-- whyyoumessingwithme?<eos> Getoffof me .<eos> Comeon,man!<eos> About damn time.<eos> Well, which one of you dumbshits forgot how to tie a slipknot?
...<eos> Please.<eos> It's my unfortunate responsibility to share with you some terrible news.
...<eos> Please.<eos> It's my unfortunate responsibility to share with you some terrible news.<eos> It seems that over the weekend a fellow student Marina mills committed suicide.<eos> 'Is it true that she filmed it on her webcam?<eos> ' one of your classmates died and all you care about is whether you can see it?<eos> Apparently, there was a video uploaded to the university website this morning.<eos> Some of you were crafty enough to grab it before we could take it down.

'no discussion.'<eos> were any of you friends with Marina?
- You wanted to talk. - Well, I'm studying.<eos> Internet addiction disorder.<eos> And you're your own case study. Exactly.<eos> What's the deal with this girl?<eos> I think she's lonely.<eos> Is she gonna be your friend or your first mental patient? She'll be my second mental patient.<eos> 'She's going through every post I've ever made in my life.' wow. She's crazy.<eos> Look, look what she just sent me.<eos> What, I wanna see.<eos> Oh, you guys are gonna live happily ever after together. - Oh, my god.
Baby, I'm really sorry. 'I gotta get back to cutting up dead people.' okay.<eos> She's tryin' to face-chat me. What do I do?<eos> Don't take the call.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> 'Go to bed.'<eos> Everyone, please.'<eos> it's my unfortunate responsibility to share with you some terrible news.
- Hey, kiddo.<eos> Nope.<eos> Did not get that information. - So, you're helping us out today?<eos> - Yeah, I'm making some stuff, too. - Yeah?<eos> You better save something for me.<eos> - Uh, guys. Still heavy.<eos> - Alright, just take it in the back, babe.<eos> - Let's go, squirt.<eos> Grab the door.<eos> - You guys good?
Can I please go to the bathroom?<eos> I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.<eos> Fine, Scott.<eos> And afterwards... why don't you stop by the principal's office and explain to him... that you're disrupting class again?<eos> I trust you know the way.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No, hang on! Hang on!<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, I know most of you were, what?
Ten fights waged. Ten fights won.<eos> The Winged Warrior.<eos> The Bird of Prey.<eos> The Angel of Death.<eos> ANGEL!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let's hear it for the fat man!<eos> Our next challenger... comes straight... from the Munich Circus.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the only one that could take on an Angel... is the Devil himself.<eos> I give you... the amazing... the fantastic...
Don't leave me.<eos> I'm not going to let them take you.<eos> Nina.<eos> Nina.<eos> Nina.<eos> What's going on?<eos> She's one of them?<eos> Tell her to stop!<eos> She can't control it!<eos> She's scared of you!
Hank, I'm here about Erik.<eos> Right.<eos> Erik.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> I think he might be in some kind of trouble.<eos> Real trouble.<eos> Isn't he always?<eos> Some of you spoke to the police... about what you believe you witnessed here yesterday.
What's wrong with you?<eos> Is that going to happen to all of us?<eos> No, I just... left my meds in the house.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hello, Mystique.<eos> Major Stryker.<eos> Colonel Stryker.<eos> I wouldn't get too close to the wall, if I were you.
- Jean.<eos> - ...to stop what is coming.<eos> Jean, if you can hear me, focus on my voice.<eos> Cairo.<eos> Find us, Jean.<eos> Find us.<eos> Cairo.<eos> Find us.<eos> This message is for one reason alone.<eos> To tell the strongest among you... Those with the greatest power... this earth will be yours.
If he does that, he'll have the power to control every mind in the world.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> It's Erik.<eos> You guys help Nightcrawler get into the pyramid.<eos> Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik.<eos> How are we gonna get through that?<eos> I can get you in there.<eos> I came here for him.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The rest of you, get Charles on this plane and get him out of here.
We can come back tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> No, tomorrow is going to be too late.<eos> She left the tent, she's going to come back to sleep.<eos> Her clothes are hanging on the line.<eos> Sleeping here is foolish.<eos> We'll not stop looking for Jess in the daytime.<eos> Now, we must go.<eos> I understand.<eos> You two, go.
Wow, Paris.<eos> You guys have been everywhere.<eos> It's beautiful. I've been three times. Have you ever been?<eos> - No, actually not.<eos> - Can you imagine Christmas?<eos> - It's great. The Eiffel Tower.<eos> - Have you been in it?<eos> Yeah, three times, girl!<eos> Aren't you going to Spain?<eos> You guys are doing a lot of travelling. It's awesome.
No.<eos> Want me to do it?<eos> No.<eos> Tan jacket.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> Enjoy your flight.<eos> If you're seated in an emergency exit row, please review the responsibilities for emergency exit seating on the back of the safety information card located in the seat pocket in front of you.
Around D.C., I guess.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Candy won't talk about him.<eos> - Candy?<eos> - My mom.<eos> Just says he was a big hero and a total asshole.<eos> We're beginning our descent, so if you need to stretch your legs or use the lavatories, you should do it now.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> It's the haircut.<eos> All you contractors go to the same barber?
Is that you?<eos> No, sir, it's not me.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I have a witness who can exonerate me.<eos> But he has to live first.<eos> Why don't you... Why don't you come in? We'll talk about it.<eos> Will you guarantee his safety?<eos> You're not in charge any more, Major.<eos> Neither are you, apparently.<eos> Operatives have been ahead of you this whole time.
My pleasure.<eos> Claudio, how are you?<eos> See you later.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you sign mine too?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> Your attention please.<eos> On behalf of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, and in honor of our guest, Dr. Stefan Zweig, a warm welcome to you all.
- My pleasure.<eos> Your attention please.<eos> On behalf of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, and in honor of our guest, Dr. Stefan Zweig, a warm welcome to you all.<eos> Your works arrived here long before you.<eos> They can be found on display in our bookshops, on the shelves of our living rooms and especially in our hearts.<eos> That is the only explanation for the more than 2,000 people who attended your reading yesterday.<eos> Our thanks go to your publisher, Mr. Abrahão Koogan, who persuaded you to stop by on your way to the writer's congress in Buenos Aires.<eos> But I won't keep you any longer, we're all hungry, and the horse race is not going to wait for us.<eos> Esteemed Foreign Minister Soares, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> As some of you may know, I no longer live in my homeland.

And we who believe in a future Europe should remember that first European, that ardent advocate of peace.<eos> Even though he failed.<eos> So you believe that a peaceful Europe is possible?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe in a free Europe.<eos> I believe that borders and passports will one day be history.<eos> But I doubt we'll live to experience it.<eos> My pessimism regarding the immediate future was unfortunately always justified.<eos> I can only invest my hope in the larger movements that span centuries.<eos> But for me, and thus unfortunately for you, too, they will come too late.
Get out of the way.<eos> My dear Senhora Zweig.<eos> Dr. Zweig.<eos> You find me grief-stricken.<eos> I am terribly sorry to welcome you like this.<eos> Oh no, I beg you.<eos> We are extremely grateful to you for welcoming us.<eos> We would gladly have visited you at your town hall, but...<eos> At the town hall.<eos> We have to catch our plane in Recife and it's wonderful that you...
Hello.<eos> I come from outside the wall, where we have all but destroyed each other.<eos> We designed you city as an experiment. And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.<eos> And we created factions to ensure peace.<eos> But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions, these will be the divergent.
Hello.<eos> I come from outside the wall, where we have all but destroyed each other.<eos> We designed you city as an experiment. And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.<eos> And we created factions to ensure peace.<eos> But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions, these will be the divergent.<eos> They are the true purpose of this experiment, they are vital to humanity survival.<eos> If you are watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded.
You saved me?<eos> It's what you do for family.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Hey, partners.<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Yes, that's what I'm doing, I'm getting out of here.<eos> Look, I don't want to be here when your crazy mom goes around killing everybody who used to work for Jeanine, okay?<eos> Look, I can join you guys or I could... Yell: Help!
You're coming with me.<eos> I have to go.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> You ready? Yeah.<eos> Autopilot engage.<eos> You want to go back to Chicago, I'll take you.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You want to walk cross the fringe, I don't think so.<eos> There's no rule saying you can't go home, four. Come on.<eos> - I'll go with you.
- Tris, this is not the way.<eos> - Let her speak, David.<eos> What mistakes, Tris?<eos> The human beings cannot be categorized in this way.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> Maybe it's time to start embracing everyone instead of dividing them into groups.<eos> Regardless whether they are 'pure' or they are 'damaged'.<eos> - That isn't what we're here to discuss.<eos> - Well, it should be.<eos> Look, I know that all of this is just an experiment to you, but these people in Chicago are real.
They spit and stink.<eos> - So do she.<eos> - So do we!<eos> Greetings mammals.<eos> The Shangri Lama will see you...<eos> - Now!<eos> - How wonderful!<eos> - So where is he?<eos> - He is here!<eos> Talking to you.
-Yeah, absolutely.<eos> -So this is a good-- yeah.<eos> And I think the other magicians-- how you say?<eos> They are okay with it.<eos> can you hear me?<eos> yes, I can hear you, frank.<eos> Can you give us, in general, Just a little bit more light backstage, something?<eos> direct from germany, Master illusionist jan rouven.<eos> thank you very much for your applause.<eos> My name is jan rouven, and I came all the way From germany to be here for you tonight.
wait, wait, david.<eos> Can you do this if you're naked, though? - That's the real question.<eos> - -yeah, naked.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - -naked, naked! naked!<eos> Naked!<eos> That's a whole other price of a ticket.<eos> in your little skimmies.<eos> wear your little skimmies!<eos> You guys don't even need me to be doing magic up here.
I see siegfried and roy.<eos> --hello.<eos> - hi.<eos> -I'm mark travis.<eos> -Hi mark, I'm jan.<eos> -Jan, nice to meet you.<eos> Hi, frank.<eos> Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> -Very nice to meet you. -How are you guys?<eos> Now how are you two related?
Look at me, I'm Mommy!<eos> Caspar, get off the table.<eos> Rosita, have you seen my car keys?<eos> Norman, would you please tell them what a good singer I am?<eos> Oh, yeah, you were great, honey.<eos> And by the way, the bathroom sink is blocked again.<eos> Bye, honey!<eos> One, two, three, four!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> I thought you guys said you were musicians!
Here we go.<eos> Hit it!<eos> - Okay, that's everyone, Mr. Moon.<eos> All right, call everyone back to stage, Miss Crawly, and let's get... Ohh!

Bye, Andy.<eos> Bye, Freddy. Bye-bye, Caspar.<eos> This contest is war!<eos> This stage is the battlefield.<eos> Your song is your weapon. Now you only get one shot to blow that audience away, so choose carefully from the list of songs I've selected for each of you.
The darn thing keeps popping out.<eos> You almost killed me, Jumbo!<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Pete?<eos> Pete, you're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> Just hang in there, buddy.<eos> Ricki?<eos> Kai?<eos> Why aren't you guys rehearsing?
Yeah!<eos> Beautiful work, guys. Now, just follow me on the beat.<eos> And as you can see, this is no ordinary theater.<eos> This is a palace of wonder and magic.<eos> He's done it! He's really done it, Nana!<eos> Oh!<eos> Goodness!<eos> Now, welcome our first contestant.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Which one of you is Moon?
But she's gonna chase those blues away with a song of her very own.<eos> Allow me to introduce the singing sensation...<eos> Ash!<eos> Judith?<eos> You are all trespassing on private property.<eos> - What?<eos> - And you will leave right now.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Judith...<eos> All of you!
Ash!<eos> Ash!<eos> What about that?<eos> We just witnessed the birth of a genuine rock star!<eos> Moon, you've got some stuck here.<eos> Ow! He may be tiny, but there's no denying his enormous talent.<eos> Would you please welcome to the stage, Mike!<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> Relax, sweetheart.<eos> Just came back to show you bozos how it's really done.
Look at me, I'm turning red.<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Keep it coming.<eos> Well, I better get back.<eos> They'll be wondering what happened to me.<eos> You'll visit me though, yeah?<eos> Yeah, course I will.<eos> See you, son.<eos> We have one final act for you tonight.
By merely augmented retro framing or "BARF".<eos> God, I got to work on that acronym.<eos> An extremely costly method, of hijacking the hippocampus to clear... traumatic memories.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport, or the things I did to avoid processing my grief.<eos> Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment.<eos> No one in the right mind would ever funded it.<eos> Help me out.<eos> What's the MIT admission statement.<eos> To generate, disseminate and preserve knowledge, and work with others, to bring to bear on the world's great challenges.<eos> Well, you, or the others.

Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?<eos> Your suit.<eos> A Vibranium?<eos> The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations.<eos> A mantle passed from warrior to warrior.<eos> And now because your friend murdered my father,<eos> I also wear the mantle of king.<eos> So I ask you, as both warrior and king, how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?<eos> What's going to happen?<eos> The same thing that ought to happen to you.
Coach Snyder.<eos> A lot of people show up for the Big Ten meet.<eos> Not all of them are gonna be on our side, you understand?<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> You gotta learn to block it all out!<eos> It's just noise!<eos> That's all, all this is!<eos> All it is, is noise. You hear me?<eos> They will love you or they will hate you.
No, you run with an injured back, you could be out for months.<eos> All right?<eos> Forget it. Coach, let me do this.<eos> The three days did the trick.<eos> It'll only be 10 seconds.<eos> Better be faster than that.<eos> Go.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... The first sprint final of the day, the 100-yard dash!<eos> Negro!<eos> They will love you or they will hate you.
Anyway, when he got back...<eos> Well, there was something going on on our block.<eos> Someone had poisoned a neighbor's cat.<eos> And Mike, I don't know how... But he figured out who did it.<eos> Yeah, got his picture in the paper.<eos> Now, this closeness, the bond between father and son, did that continue until the death of the victim?<eos> No, no.<eos> I mean, I don't know, it might've been, you know, adolescent rebellion, but it came out...<eos> Well, I guess it was about eight months before Boone died.<eos> Well, I don't want to give offense to any of you candy-ass liberals here, well, maybe, if you get...
Hey, we can't stop. We can't stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Why was I goin' so fast? Listen to me.<eos> We can't stop.<eos> Okay, listen to me, listen to me!<eos> We can't stop.<eos> Look at us.<eos> We can't stop.<eos> Okay?<eos> You two in the minivan!
Don't you stop. Don't you stop.<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> We just got to make it through.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alright.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> You in the blue minivan, get out of the Van!
He's fine.<eos> Come on.<eos> You deserved it.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Couldn't be happier.<eos> Um, hey, do you mind staying here tonight?<eos> It's a little late to drive you home.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> You okay?<eos> I want to know you all. Know this place. But I'm doing it wrong.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Maui always has time for his fans.<eos> When you use a bird to write with... it's called tweeting.<eos> I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.<eos> You are not my hero.<eos> And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!<eos> I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!<eos> Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me... which is impossible because...<eos> I got stuck here for 1,000 years... trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals.
What can I say except<eos> You're welcome<eos> For the tides, the sun, the sky<eos> Hey, it's okay, it's okay<eos> You're welcome<eos> I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!<eos> What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky<eos> When you were waddling yay high?<eos> This guy<eos> When the nights got cold Who stole you fire from down below?
I'll do it, no problem.<eos> Vlada...<eos> Milena!<eos> Listen up!<eos> I made a big decision!<eos> I'll change my life!<eos> Suzy and I will have children.<eos> We'll turn the page.<eos> How about it'?<eos> Good for you.
Motherfucking rat!<eos> How dare he threaten me!<eos> How dare he? !<eos> That drunken scumbag!<eos> I'll fuck you up.<eos> I'll fucking destroy all of you.<eos> How dare you investigate me? !<eos> Motherfuckers!<eos> How dare you investigate me, how dare you lock me up? !<eos> After all I've done for you, motherfucking bastards!
You're a bit older.<eos> It was only the existence of my brother which prevented Ed from abandoning us.<eos> If I were you I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> My mother and me, yes, he loved us but evidently it wasn't us who kept him balanced.<eos> You've nothing to say?<eos> Anything I say now would be completely useless.<eos> I can only swear that I've always respected what Ed wanted.<eos> I never forced him to tear his life apart.<eos> I was happy with fragments of his time.<eos> It wasn't easy, but I've never hated anyone of you.
Let's show them what we got, Cougars!<eos> Okay, let's play foot-- Where you goin', Syd?<eos> Okay, we lost our cheerleader.<eos> Alright, let's show 'em what we got VHS!<eos> Are you ready, remember what to do?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay, you're on!<eos> - Hey, watchers!<eos> It's Syd Baby.<eos> I'm counting on you to get me to the ﬁnal round.

They know all the information about you, Vee.<eos> Your name's Vee?<eos> - Short for Venus.<eos> - I like that.<eos> Her parents, they named her after the Goddess of Love.<eos> There's a Roman myth.<eos> Yeah, I guess my mom was expecting somebody else.<eos> I dunno about that.<eos> That was some kiss.<eos> I got a game to play but good night to you guys.
What are they doing up there at that ranch? Are they being held against their will?"<eos> - Are you a prisoner here?<eos> - Are you a prisoner here?<eos> - No. No.<eos> Just smile for the camera, people.<eos> Wave.<eos> Give me this Bible.<eos> This Bible... this here book, this is a tool, people.<eos> And as such, it only has the power that we ascribe to it.<eos> But you, you are something much different.
Your hands where we can see 'em!<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - What have you done, sir?<eos> You think you bar the way?<eos> You only inflame my wrath!<eos> Your children!<eos> Your children's children will be subsumed!<eos> You all will be subsumed!<eos> No one will escape my wrath!<eos> You all!
- I've had enough of it.<eos> - Go on and leave any time you like.<eos> # Go on and leave any time you like... #<eos> Go on then, you stupid bitch.<eos> # You stupid bitch... #<eos> Though there are still no accurate figures for the number of young Irish people coming to London in search of work, the crude indications that do exist show an enormous increase.<eos> Many take the boat with barely enough money to survive a few days in London, but still they emigrate because they see hope across the sea, hope they cannot see in Ireland.<eos> This meeting has been called to order.<eos> Pray proceed.<eos> Well, as some of you may have noticed, your mother and I really are under a lot of pressure at the moment.
It means "act manly."<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get out of the bleedin' way.<eos> Morning, Brother Baxter.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - French, Brother Barnabas.<eos> - Huh?<eos> You're teaching French, not Latin.<eos> Oh, how modern.<eos> Mind you, I'd be surprised if any of you knew where France is, not to mind speaking the language.
Relax, you're not even in the band.<eos> Yeah, thank God.<eos> I'm in the band, and I will not be wearing any makeup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why?<eos> You've got great lips.<eos> No, piss off.<eos> I'm not wearing makeup.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Those of you who actually care about the band and want to do this half properly, queue over there.
It's a strange kind of love, isn't it?<eos> Parents.<eos> I would've saved her.<eos> And I could've.<eos> - No, you couldn't have.<eos> - I could've.<eos> - You're too small.<eos> - I'm not too small.<eos> You're way too small.<eos> I've a good joke for you guys.
So when are we shooting this video?<eos> Saturday next.<eos> Oh.<eos> Conor?<eos> Good.<eos> You're up.<eos> If this is about my exam results...<eos> I can explain, see...<eos> It's not about your exams, Conor.<eos> We need to talk to all of you.
I can't afford to live here on my own.<eos> So you're getting a divorce?<eos> Can't get divorced in Ireland, so we'll be legally separated.<eos> I'm gonna be getting an apartment, and you three will live between there and... there.<eos> I'm not gonna be staying at Tony's.<eos> Let's get that crystal clear.<eos> I'd rather sleep on the street.<eos> I understand this is upsetting for you, Brendan.<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> For all of you.
- Come on, it's a great place.<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> Hey Momo, the entrance will be there.<eos> Over there.<eos> So make a hole there, with a door in it.<eos> Are you tired?<eos> He can...<eos> Welcome to your favourite den of depravity.<eos> Tonight we at the Belgica are presenting the try-out of the new record by the group led by musical genius and steaming sex god Davy Coppens...<eos> Here, specially for you are The Shitz.
Listen, Nikki...<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> OK?<eos> Agreed?<eos> Yes, agreed.<eos> I get it.<eos> Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> My name is Willy.<eos> Welcome to the security guard training course.<eos> Those of you with a criminal record... may as well leave now.
Go away.<eos> Go away and ruin everything.<eos> You retarded arsehole.<eos> Go away, I don't ever want to see you again.<eos> Not this, not this.<eos> Not to me and not to him, Frank.<eos> Not like this.<eos> - Thank you for coming. - You're welcome.<eos> Frank isn't doing too well.<eos> I don't know what's going on between you, Jo.
It's fantastic, isn't it?<eos> - What if we do it the other way around?<eos> - What?<eos> What if I give you the amount I want you to give me?<eos> That's the only solution.<eos> But you can't do that, Jo.<eos> You haven't got any money either.<eos> All your money is in the business too, just like mine.<eos> I could carry on with Ferre and Rudi.<eos> You three?
Oh.<eos> Hey, thanks, really.<eos> Come on, it's nothing.<eos> How's Josh?<eos> Grounded.<eos> So... You must be all packed up and everything.<eos> I canceled.<eos> Angie, no.<eos> Well, because... Well, mom and I are taking turns guarding Josh.<eos> Anyway, I wanted to be here for you both.
Holy shit.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> So what I'm thinking right now is that I'll come up over this little hill right here.<eos> This will take me to the side of the mountain.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> You've seen how my luck's been.<eos> And there's white snow.<eos> That sun is gonna set.<eos> It reminds me of you.
My cock in your ear! I shit on your lips!<eos> Eat a fart!<eos> Hello!<eos> Fu...<eos> Listen up.<eos> Iraq Two is happening.<eos> The network is stretched thin.<eos> All our talent is going there.<eos> We need people, any people, to fill the void in Afghanistan.<eos> And you folks here are all the unmarried, childless personnel in this bureau.
- Hi.<eos> It's unfortunate.<eos> Kim, this is Tall Brian.<eos> Brian Hooper.<eos> Tall Brian. - Hi.<eos> - I'm your shooter.<eos> So, is there another Brian around here somewhere that you're taller than?<eos> Short Brian.<eos> Works for Reuters.<eos> Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?
Fahim.<eos> What inspired you to enlist originally?<eos> I'm a big fan of the movie Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<eos> We're the same height.<eos> Do you think the war in Iraq has affected your resources here?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not authorized to answer that question.<eos> I'd say we're both on the wrong side of Persia, ma'am.<eos> Iraq is where you get some right now.<eos> Here just has shit all.<eos> Are you guys getting outside the wire much?
Stay there!<eos> Kim.<eos> Get back in the car!<eos> No, please, Kim!<eos> Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!<eos> Those assholes tried to shoot us! Jesus!<eos> You have got to be shitting me!<eos> You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!<eos> That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!<eos> Can any of you geniuses tell me the Kelley Blue Book value of a 1989 Toyota pickup?
I've done mostly domestic reportage.<eos> "Reportage"?<eos> Domestic reportage.<eos> Look, everyone in the Kabubble is full of shit.<eos> It's okay. Half the accents are fake.<eos> The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces" wankers are flat out lying.<eos> "Reportage"?<eos> Oh, Christ, what is this?<eos> I really shouldn't have my back to the door.<eos> It's bad tradecraft, but it's worth it to talk to you two ladies.
You should go to the Rock 'n' Roll Museum. It sucks.<eos> You'll fit right in.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> Fahim.<eos> Let's apply for another embed. Because I want to get out of Kabul.<eos> I just need to get out of Kabul.<eos> I need "me time", exactly. That's...<eos> See?<eos> I told you that O magazine would increase your understanding of women.<eos> Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?
Fahim, what does the graffiti say?<eos> "No education for woman."<eos> Brian.<eos> Fahim, what's going on up there?<eos> The Taliban used to do this.<eos> Execute the radios and televisions.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Move on! Move on!<eos> You guys can't go out there, but I can.
Hey.<eos> No.<eos> No Esperanto.<eos> I'm not joking.<eos> No foreign language unless the language is spoken by all.<eos> You know the rule.<eos> No Esperanto!<eos> Please.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Well, then maybe one of you should have shot the fucking sheep.
- Ben.<eos> No.<eos> Children don't drink wine.<eos> In France, and other countries, children drink small amounts of wine all the time.<eos> It's a digestive.<eos> It's not crack.<eos> What's crack?<eos> Crack is a crystallized, highly addictive derivative of the stimulant cocaine.<eos> In the mid-1980s, it accelerated the decimation of inner-city neighborhoods.<eos> Crackheads, some of them kids just like you guys, were killing each other over nothing, over their Nikes.
- That's enough.<eos> - Are protected...<eos> Wait a minute. Zaja...<eos> How would you characterize the 2010 Supreme Court decision on Citizens United?<eos> Corporations have the same rights as people, so there's no spending limit on candidates.<eos> Which means our country is ruled by corporations and their lobbyists who fund candidates and command their fealty by demanding that...<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You made your point, we get it.<eos> It's very impressive.<eos> All of you.
I can't say any more. I don't even know that much myself.<eos> It's, um...<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> You can't tell anyone.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Follow me.<eos> We have to be quiet.<eos> It's almost midnight.<eos> I sincerely hope you two lovebirds haven't been doing what I think you've been doing.
And she loved her husband, Ben, and their children...<eos> I'll, uh, take that as my cue, if I may.<eos> First of all,<eos> Leslie practiced Buddhism, which, to her, was a philosophy and not an organized religion.<eos> In fact, Leslie abhorred all organized religions.<eos> To her, they were the most dangerous fairy tales ever invented. Designed to elicit blind obedience and strike fear into the hearts of the innocent and the uninformed.<eos> To her, the only thing worse than death would have been the knowledge that her rotting flesh was to be trapped for all eternity inside a big box and buried in the middle of a fucking golf course.<eos> Although the absurdity of being eulogized by someone that didn't even know her has exactly the kind of comedic flourish that Leslie would have cherished.<eos> If nothing else, she had a sense of humor.<eos> I want to read something to all of you, so you'll know what I mean.
Me, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> We want to complete the mission. No.<eos> There's no mission.<eos> Mission: Rescue Dad and Mommy.<eos> Mom wanted to be cremated.<eos> And we want to honor her wishes.<eos> And flush her down the toilet.<eos> I can't put any of you in danger ever again.
No... Don't even.<eos> Hey.<eos> May I help you?<eos> This ain't scary enough, huh?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Sorry, I'm not trying to be nosey.<eos> I just overheard you guys saying this wasn't scary enough.<eos> Couldn't agree more.<eos> If you ever wanna be really scared, just call that number.<eos> Custom scares just for you.
Sorry, I'm not trying to be nosey.<eos> I just overheard you guys saying this wasn't scary enough.<eos> Couldn't agree more.<eos> If you ever wanna be really scared, just call that number.<eos> Custom scares just for you.<eos> I promise you will not be disappointed.<eos> Okay, man. Uh... Thanks.<eos> You're so welcome.<eos> Have a good one, buddy.<eos> And you.
You drive a fucking Prius?<eos> - Are you...<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> Do you hate your freedom, Joe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I mean, do you have any idea how many people have died for your right to be gluten free or whatever?<eos> It's great mileage, you fucking asshole.<eos> Wow! Give me the tour before all the kale salad goes bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you guys again for letting us stay with you.
They even reprogrammed your phone so that all of your 911 calls go directly to Fear, Inc.<eos> So you're telling me that this whole time I was talking to one of their employees?<eos> You didn't think it was at all strange that nobody showed up here?<eos> Fuck.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I'm gonna turn myself in.<eos> I'm gonna turn myself in.<eos> And I'm gonna tell them that you guys had nothing to do with it.
- Don't...<eos> Wow, Joe.<eos> Boyfriend of the year.<eos> Look, man, it was an accident.<eos> - Quiet!<eos> - It was just a mistake.<eos> Check him.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, Cat.<eos> You people.
Do you know where I can find him?<eos> May I ask what this is about?<eos> No, you may not.<eos> Very well.<eos> Have him call me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Raj, who's at the door?<eos> That's not him.<eos> Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone.<eos> I told them all about you.
-Good.<eos> You can't have an animal in your photo. - This is your official ID.<eos> -What animal?<eos> I don't see an animal.<eos> This is my co-pilot.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look this way.<eos> Say "cheese," Bob.<eos> You know what? I might have just the right thing for you two.
It's okay, Bob.<eos> He likes your hat. - Great.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Can we buy a magazine?<eos> Sorry, it's not my patch. You've got to speak to that guy.<eos> We really wanna help.<eos> - You can't--<eos> -Thank you.<eos> - Have a great day. - Okay.<eos> All right. And you.
Let go.<eos> You see him bounce off that rock there?<eos> I didn't see where he landed. I did.<eos> On the bottom.<eos> Well, you better go down there and make sure he's dead. You crazy?<eos> I'm not climbing down there.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Tubby ain't climbing down there.<eos> Damn!<eos> Hey, you two.
I know how to treat a man.<eos> I know what a husband likes...<eos> Stop it.<eos> Please take me with you, I need to get out of here.<eos> There are no good men left in this town.<eos> I'm not here to save you.<eos> I'm not here to save anybody.<eos> Don't say that, you don't have to be alone.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You imagine that you know who I am just 'cause you think everybody outside this town has it better than you, that other people somehow aren't suffering the same.
Put your arms in the water.<eos> I told you I'd find you, didn't I?<eos> And before you start asking for anything, there's not gonna be any sympathy today.<eos> Now get your arms back in the water.<eos> Put them in the water.<eos> Now listen to me. I didn't come here today with any compassion at all.<eos> The four of you killed my dog and you tried to kill me.<eos> Now, it was a mistake to leave me alive.<eos> I'm not gonna make that mistake.<eos> I've killed more human beings than I care to remember. And I will not hesitate or quit until the four of you are in the dirt.
Roy?<eos> Oh, lord.<eos> Tubby, catch your breath somewhere else and get away from the goddamn window.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What happened?<eos> - You went after that man, didn't you?<eos> I told you not to.<eos> I made it perfectly clear that you were not to aggravate the situation.<eos> But you did, didn't you?<eos> All of you did.
Marshal.<eos> - Stop it! - Marshal!<eos> We thought he was dead.<eos> Honest.<eos> I don't know how he could've survived.<eos> I told you we should have gone down there, made sure.<eos> Oh, shut up. Both of you.<eos> Y'all should have known better than to let him get away with something like this.<eos> Why the hell am I even paying you?<eos> Now, which one of you girls seen him?
Well, the feeling's mutual.<eos> Tubby, how long does it take you to get your fat ass around that building?<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> Shit.<eos> - That's it.<eos> I'm going out there.<eos> - No. No. No, you can't leave us here.<eos> The hell I can't.<eos> He's not after you, he's after me.
- No. No. No, you can't leave us here.<eos> The hell I can't.<eos> He's not after you, he's after me.<eos> - She said it, you remember?<eos> - He's crazy.<eos> And the Marshal told you to protect us.<eos> And I'm your fiancée, you don't just up and leave your fiancée.<eos> Ellen, right now I wouldn't care if you were the tip of my dick!<eos> I am going out there.<eos> You forget about what my dad said, because he doesn't care about either of you.
It's a lot to take.<eos> I didn't know it would be like this.<eos> All right, now, Tubby.<eos> Stop calling me Tubby!<eos> I don't want to be called that anymore.<eos> I'm not even that fat!<eos> You all act like all I do is sit around eating all day.<eos> I don't!<eos> I work!<eos> And I eat less than you all.
She's here! Brenda's alive!<eos> She's okay.<eos> Is that you, Brady Mannion?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!<eos> Asshole, you hear me or what?<eos> Are you having fun?<eos> A little bit, yeah, how about you?<eos> Not yet, but I have a feeling that's about to change.<eos> What you got, big plans tonight?<eos> It's all one big joke to you, isn't it?
- All right, cool.<eos> Hey, how's Peyton tonight?<eos> - Oh, come on, man, don't ask me.<eos> - I wanna know if she's doing all right.<eos> She seems fine.<eos> We're really busy, man.<eos> I gotta roll.<eos> Hey.<eos> Quit stressing, let's eat.<eos> I really am sorry about what's going on with you and Peyton.
The one who told me to suck his dick.<eos> Uh, actually that was me.<eos> Got your lips all primed, buddy?<eos> Where does that vile hate you spew come from?<eos> Do you have Mommy issues?<eos> Daddy issues?<eos> Maybe I should speak to them and find out?<eos> - Yo, ass-clown, listen up!<eos> - Aren't you curious why I'm calling?<eos> Why I've chosen you?
Well, that's why you post your little videos online, isn't it?<eos> So the world can see how clever you are.<eos> Well, tonight I'm gonna give you all the attention you deserve.<eos> Get ready.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Oh, my God, are you okay?<eos> - Are you guys drunk?<eos> - A little bit, yeah.<eos> Wanna join?<eos> No, what I want is to deliver this pizza and not hear from you guys.
No, no, no, no no, no, no!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> I'm done with this bullshit.<eos> That is enough, all right?<eos> Your little game to turn us against each other to hurt each other, it is not gonna happen.<eos> All right, I'm not going to do it.<eos> Now, turn the video back on in real time.<eos> I wanna see Peyton and I wanna see Brady's parents right now!<eos> I'm sorry, boys.<eos> I haven't been entirely honest with you.
Actually, I have a farmhand, Demeter.<eos> - Demeter, huh?<eos> - My parents were Bulgarian, and when they passed away, he just stayed on with the farm.<eos> Got it.<eos> So... I'm still trying to make sense of this story of yours.<eos> Well, it... it is complicated.<eos> So... there's these friends of yours, and then this big dude?<eos> - The Tall Man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you guy's have been fighting him for years?
The year is 1979.<eos> The funeral home where first we met.<eos> You called it Morningside.<eos> In three days, your younger self will attend a funeral here... and events will be set in motion.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> You've tried to thrust yourself in my way for years now, but what has it got you?<eos> You loved ones, all gone.<eos> You slaughtered my family.<eos> You... they're all dead!<eos> None of you ever listen.
Who gives a shit?<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight?<eos> -No, I like it at home.<eos> -Call Megan.<eos> Ask her to come back.<eos> She just quit. She what?<eos> She just told me she got another job.<eos> Oh.<eos> Shame. Thought you guys were kind of a good team together.
I just completely blacked out. Everyone had a little too much to drink, -so it's okay.<eos> -I know, but, uh, with the eggs and then i-i screamed at you. That I was that abusive, i just feel... I just feel so ashamed about it.<eos> I don't... Tom... tom said that, um...<eos> That I smashed your plate.<eos> I don't...<eos> Tom was fired...<eos> Fired because of how I behaved. You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom. Youwantto liedown?<eos> -Come with me. -Okay.<eos> Excuse us. Rachel, are you feeling better?<eos> You guys can stay tonight if you want.
I'm from Ontario.<eos> It's 8:32.<eos> Three minutes until the diversion.<eos> In this kind of situation, I find it useful to think about something funny.<eos> Smile or something.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You already told me that.<eos> Can you even see me?<eos> Not really.<eos> - Ah. You two.

I don't believe it!<eos> Max, this is splendid.<eos> Marianne!<eos> Wonderful party! Brilliant!<eos> Getting enough to drink?<eos> Very funny, old man.<eos> Hey, excuse me. We have a garden for that.<eos> Take it outside, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> You two, outside. Outside.
I bet you feel like you're surrounded by savages. No.<eos> No, I really appreciate everything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You do?<eos> I bet you don't know what the hell you're looking at, or listening to.<eos> These are the last of the survivors.<eos> The last of their kind.<eos> They know this little patch of desert's gonna be here long after the rest of this country cannibalizes itself.<eos> Okay and why is that gonna happen?<eos> Okay, well, it'll happen because most of you people are too goddamn comfortable to see it.

If it wasn't for the rain...<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> How many can you get open in half an hour?<eos> Think about it.<eos> 50? 60 at most?<eos> All that effort for nothing.<eos> Come on.<eos> It doesn't have to be that way.<eos> Not for everyone.<eos> One of you can get away rich.
I'll tip you some other time.<eos> Now what did they tell you?<eos> Any explanation?<eos> They've changed their mind.<eos> We hired an ex-Secret Service man who works freelance and has done things for us.<eos> The guy inside is ex-Secret Service?<eos> No, he's not inside, we couldn't risk it, in case there was a problem.<eos> A shitstorm like this, you mean?<eos> His link to the party would've come to light, so this is someone else who gets orders directly from him without knowing anything about us or the contents of the box.<eos> Did any of you know about this?
Take it easy, Spaniard.<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> Holy fucking shit, Loco!<eos> It wasn't me, that fucker conned us!<eos> You fucked up, you idiot!<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get up, dumbass.<eos> - C'mon. - Fucking retard.<eos> You've got the clothes, now it's up to you.
There could be anything in that box.<eos> Talk to everyone. Find out what they know or what they suspect.<eos> This is already on the move.<eos> I want a list of anyone who might be involved in there.<eos> If we screw up and it hits the media,<eos> I want everyone to have answers, no improvisation.<eos> I don't want anyone talking crap to a camera.<eos> - So you're...<eos> - The man you asked for.<eos> I can close a deal with you here and now.
It's a personal matter. Can you arrange for my voice to be projected from his glasses, please. Let me see what I can do.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Darby.<eos> Darby.<eos> This is your conscience.<eos> You have been a bad bad, bad boy.<eos> Hey, what... who?<eos> Rise and shine, big boy.<eos> This is your wake up call.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I knew it was you guys anyway.
- Okay. - Here we go and jump. Okay.<eos> - You alright?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You're okay? - Yeah.<eos> Alright.<eos> Cassandra, follow me.<eos> Come on, guys. You're too slow.<eos> Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here.<eos> We're gonna be fine.<eos> Exit the hatch in front of you, then take the hatch on the right.
For trusting you.<eos> I've always loved you to bits, since you were this high.<eos> And you couldn't trust me?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Me!<eos> What was the plan?<eos> I've never felt so insignificant in my whole life.<eos> Never.<eos> I'm going back to the truck.<eos> Then I'm going home, with or without you both.
Dickhead!<eos> Dickhead!<eos> Where is she?<eos> She says she won't move until she talks to the owner of the tree.<eos> Who does she fucking think she is, Mahatma Gandhi?<eos> You're serious?<eos> What a family. What a bloody family!<eos> Fine, I'm leaving.<eos> It's over.<eos> I'm getting in that truck and going home, with or without you both.
Okay, we are under compulsory evidence origin disclosure order.<eos> Okay, in a case this massive, all evidence has to be obtained legally.<eos> Look, if I caught this trail, others will, too.<eos> Okay, you gotta get your shit in order.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The entire case rests on this.<eos> We have a case here, and we're gonna win it.<eos> Yeah, well, you are playing with fire.<eos> Okay, I don't know what's going on between you two, but you gotta stop it.
I'd prefer if we spoke off the record.<eos> Okay.<eos> New events have come to light that change the nature of this allegation.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, I could elaborate, but I would prefer if Mr. Cahill did.<eos> It's curious, isn't it, that she was drawn to us both?<eos> What the hell you talking about?<eos> What is this?<eos> I understand you're in possession of files that were illegally stolen from my computer.<eos> Everything was obtained legally and submitted to you in discovery.
He claims there's some freak in Brae who pays for dead animals.<eos> Who the hell puts roadkill in the boot of a van in Aberdeen and then takes it on a 200-mile sea trip?<eos> So...<eos> Craig admitted he was on the ferry?<eos> Yes, but he doesn't know Robbie and he wasn't at St Ninian's.<eos> And he doesn't know anything about a rucksack or a holdall, and presumably he didn't kick lumps out of me, either.<eos> Did we get the CCTV back from the ferry yet?<eos> - On its way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Right, well, let's get the blood analysed and... you two can go and visit the guy in Brae.
Still falling for the wrong girl too, I'll bet?<eos> Line your excuses up for lunch. I must talk business with Tony.<eos> Drinks are in the drawing room. Just follow the music.<eos> Are you married?<eos> Er... no.<eos> Good!<eos> I was hoping to fix Elva up with Julius Hanbury... but look... bagged by a bloody actress!<eos> As if I care.<eos> Baronets are ten-a-penny in Annabel's these days.<eos> Perhaps I shall throw you two together, instead.
Well, the fair packs up tomorrow, sir.<eos> Just so.<eos> What happened, I... erm...<eos> I can't change yesterday, but... ..a better tomorrow, yes?<eos> For all of us.<eos> Sir.<eos> I think I met Bixby.<eos> Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you?
Time to hunt!<eos> Skitter scatter boys.<eos> Find me the chiddler.<eos> This be my work.<eos> This be my work, boys!<eos> Look at me!<eos> Once, we giants, we be gentries.<eos> Those days are over.<eos> Where is the delicious little chat-bay?<eos> Right, out, all of you!
♪ where I talk to my brothers ♪ oh-oh-oh-oohh<eos> - June, wake the fuck up.<eos> What the fuck is goin' on?<eos> What don't you two gentlefucks tell me what it is I can do for ya at 7 A.M. on a fuckin' Tuesday.
What the fuck is goin' on?<eos> What don't you two gentlefucks tell me what it is I can do for ya at 7 A.M. on a fuckin' Tuesday.<eos> - Listen, cut the shit.<eos> You know why we're here.<eos> - See originally, the plan was just to take your friend.<eos> The dead one over there with us.<eos> Looks like you're gonna have to take his place.<eos> - It's time to pay up.<eos> - Alright, here's how it's gonna go.<eos> Either one of you raise those my way, and you're both gonna be a couple of fuckin' Jackson pollocks on the wall behind you!
- Just preparing for this evening's mass.<eos> Come in, sit down.<eos> - I'll stand, thanks.<eos> You can see time has been generous to you, father Francis.<eos> You've aged well.<eos> Preparing for mass, huh?<eos> Yeah, I remember how that whole shindig goes.<eos> - Yes, it's quite a delicate task.<eos> - Well, you think after, what's it been?<eos> 40 years of doing this. It would become like second nature to you bead mumblers.
You and June bug.<eos> And I know you come here with a mission.<eos> On the warpath with fire in your eyes let me tell you right now, what you come here to save is dead and gone boy.<eos> You have my shit here tonight!<eos> And I'll let you both live.<eos> How 'bout that, huh?<eos> How 'bout that, do we understand each other?<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> Now get the fuck outta my office.<eos> You two, both a you, get the fuck outta here!
Was that really you playing?<eos> It was too good.<eos> You sure it wasn't Mommy?<eos> No.<eos> You're telling me it was really you playing?<eos> That's basically it.<eos> - Can't believe it!<eos> My children are geniuses.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm so proud of you both.
Fully catatonic.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So how do holding up?<eos> It shouldn't be like this, you know.<eos> I know she's still in there.<eos> She's just trapped.<eos> When I look at her eyes, I can see her screaming to get out.<eos> I thought of all people, you doctors, you know, you'd be able to give us some hope, you know.
One through 12.<eos> Dr. Najjar, what do you see?<eos> I might be late tonight.<eos> No, everything is fine.<eos> Dr. Ryan, it's Souhel.<eos> Yes, yes, but I think I have something you might be interested in.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> - Hello.<eos> I may have some explanation for you.
(MIME GROANING)<eos> (CONTINUES GROANING)<eos> (MUMBLING) I lost my teeth.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> I don't know, something about "teesh"?<eos> (COUGHING)<eos> Oh, he lost his teeth.<eos> Terry.<eos> Hey!<eos> You sons of bitches ain't going anywhere!
- It don't matter.<eos> - What do I do about it?<eos> - You go to a drugstore.<eos> They'll give you some cream or something.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> - (SIGHS)<eos> - What's thrush, Pop?<eos> Thrush is a small to medium-sized songbird.<eos> Now, get the fuck out of here.<eos> Can you guys not discuss his genital complaints while I'm trying to eat?
Oh, that's not great.<eos> You'd be out on your asses already, frankly, if the powers that be could prove some of the rumours I've been hearing.<eos> Yeah, but you know what they say about rumours, though.<eos> Rumours are the mothers of invention.<eos> No, necessity's the mother of invention.<eos> What are rumours, then?<eos> - Rumours are...<eos> - Silencio!<eos> Assaulting a fellow officer, that's one thing.<eos> Bribery and corruption charges against you and that's it, that's goodnight, Irene.
Here we go.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Cocksucking Cowboys.<eos> Bollocks are still sore and I didn't do anything to you.<eos> Well, the world's full of injustice, pal.<eos> Call Amnesty International if you wanna do something about it.<eos> Salud.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - Ah!<eos> I thought you guys didn't drink.
Who took these?<eos> A fucking epileptic?<eos> No, Robert Mapplethorpe over here.<eos> A little something was wrong with the, uh...<eos> PÁDRAIC:<eos> With the thing?<eos> Yeah, with the thing.<eos> Oh, yeah, the thing can be tricky.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> Hey, motherfucker, I could bust you right now for...
- (CHUCKLES)<eos> Thank you. (GIGGLES)<eos> (ROBACUNA BY DAVILA 666 PLAYING)<eos> BOB:<eos> That's amazing.<eos> The flexibility.<eos> (SONG CONTINUES)<eos> (MAN CHEERING)<eos> You should have seen her when she was 15.<eos> You guys looking for me?
Jacqueline Hollis?<eos> Jackie Hollis?<eos> Jackie Hollis, whatever.<eos> She doesn't work for me any more, she quit.<eos> Yeah, I didn't ask you if she's currently employed here.<eos> I asked you for her address.<eos> She in some kind of trouble?<eos> - (CHUCKLES)<eos> - Just give us her fucking address.<eos> You guys are adorable.
(MOANING CONTINUES)<eos> No preamble, no nothing.<eos> MAN: (ON TV) Oh, yeah.<eos> Take it!<eos> Where's the romance?<eos> Starts and ends with the script.<eos> - You ain't got a good script... - (DIALLING PHONE) ...you ain't got shit.<eos> (BOYS GRUNTING)<eos> BOB:<eos> You guys think you're tough?

Playboy Mansion.<eos> - REGGIE:<eos> Hey!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Whatever it is, it's happening at the mosque downtown, 1:00 pm tomorrow.<eos> Don't ask me what.<eos> Who's doing the driving?<eos> The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> One thing that I forgot to tell you guys is...
Fuck off.<eos> - You fuck off.<eos> - No, you fuck off.<eos> - You fuck off.<eos> - No, you fuck off.<eos> - You fuck off.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> You might wanna be a little careful or you'll wind up another dead schizophrenic, you know what I'm saying?<eos> And that bike is way too small for you.
It's hard but it's fair.<eos> It is pretty fair, yeah.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Fine.<eos> Mmm.<eos> How are you finding the place?<eos> Not exactly the best place to blend in but upside is I think I'm falling in love.<eos> Baby, where have you been?<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> You guys want a drink?
You do surprise me.<eos> I read it in the original Greek when I was travelling through the Peloponnese with my father.<eos> I lost my fucking eye!<eos> Calm down.<eos> You still have one good one.<eos> I'm gonna fuck over those fucking assholes...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're not gonna fuck over anyone.<eos> They're still policemen, after all.<eos> I don't wanna get into some kinda fucking contretemps with you, Your Lordship, especially not in my condition.
You got it.<eos> PÁDRAIC:<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> MAITRE D':<eos> I'm sorry, you can't come in here looking like that.<eos> - PÁDRAIC:<eos> For fuck's sake.<eos> - You can't come in here wearing...<eos> See the fucking man over there?<eos> He's a fucking policeman, he'll kick the shit out of you.
Yes, it's fine.<eos> I'd like the bill, please.<eos> BOB:<eos> Oh, that's fantastic.<eos> TERRY: That's good.<eos> Hey, Bob.<eos> Did I ever tell you about that time I puked Indian food through my nose?<eos> - No!<eos> - Gentlemen, is this a social visit or do you have a particular reason for embarrassing me?<eos> We're not trying to embarrass you.
Okay.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Random death by jellyfish.<eos> This guy I knew, he caught a jellyfish, put it in a jar, went out drinking, got home...<eos> Listen to this.<eos> Got home and reached for what he thought was a glass of water...<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> He's dead.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> Well, I'm glad you guys find the idea so amusing.
So what do I know?<eos> Oh, I love this car!<eos> She's fucking indestructible.<eos> (EXHALES)<eos> Like I always say, Bob, if it ain't broke, break it.<eos> (CONTINUES CLICKING LIGHTER TOP)<eos> Detectives, good to see you again.<eos> You like Westerns, right?<eos> I don't have your $800,000.<eos> I was never going to give it to you.
- Just be cool.<eos> - This is very upsetting to me.<eos> This is...<eos> This is not good.<eos> This...<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey there, Ron.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Wait. You guys know each other?
So... it looks like somehow, despite our best efforts, we have a success on our hands.<eos> All I can say is thank you. To your good health and hip hip hooray!<eos> Michèle!<eos> Michèle!<eos> Michèle!<eos> Well...<eos> I couldn't put it any better.<eos> Have a great evening!<eos> Have you met Richard?<eos> Some time ago, Richard pitched a very interesting idea. You two working together could make something fabulous of it.
I'm here. I brought backup.<eos> There are too many of them.<eos> I've already killed you.<eos> Marius!<eos> - Marius. - Please.<eos> I wish your father was alive to see this.<eos> His ridiculous dream of you ruling this coven... will be the very thing that kills you.<eos> Missed.<eos> Oh, it worked.<eos> I'm one of you.
I don't allow language like that in my house.<eos> Well, I don't live here.<eos> You know, it's been really hard for us emotionally since my mother threw herself in front of a cow truck about four years ago. We've been trying to acclimate.<eos> - That's not even funny.<eos> - Hard to adjust emotionally.<eos> No, it's not funny.<eos> I'm just trying to give her some insight as to why you're acting out.<eos> Okay, I think it's time for you to go.<eos> I think if you gave me five more minutes, ma'am.<eos> I have been trying to be Christian, but I can see the devil has a hold of the two of you.
Hey, bitch. Hey, bitch.<eos> Watch it. Your fucking elbow.<eos> Hey, yo, there's Krystal.<eos> Let's do this shit.<eos> - Hey, excuse me.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - All right.<eos> - You're getting whacked.<eos> What you get?<eos> - I feel bad for you ladies...
- Hey, Star.<eos> And that's Frank.<eos> Jake's gone.<eos> I told him he can't come back again.<eos> Anyways...<eos> Hey, so this is all... Hey!<eos> - Krystal's fucking talking.<eos> - Yo, everybody.<eos> So this is all poor people. I've got family from here.<eos> It's just poor people like y'all, so they'll pity you because you're just like them.
Right.<eos> Ya know, you really should just talk to the Commander about it.<eos> Yes, Sir, absolutely, Sir.<eos> Oh!<eos> Ah!<eos> - Are you all right, Bert?<eos> - Fuck no, I'm not all right!<eos> I haven't had a cigarette.<eos> So what was it you needed to talk to me about then, Captain?<eos> You guys down at Property had tagged this little puppy and it's goin' up for auction this week.
Well, you're out there smoking that refer, so you might not... I'm sorry?<eos> Am I on an official assignment here?<eos> Short of getting hired as bellhop, there's nothing that more I can do.<eos> And I'm not wasting anymore vacation days on this, either.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way, because we're friends, and and you're also my boss... fuck you, Jim!<eos> - This is some bullshit right here.<eos> - David.<eos> David!<eos> Stay positive, Dude!<eos> I'm leavin' this with you guys, Treasury'll be by to pick it up.
This is going to be interesting.<eos> Okay, Saroo...<eos> Why did you choose this course?<eos> What else do you want to get out of it?<eos> Hi, Hey!<eos> - Welcome. - Come in.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Do you guys like Indian food?
What are you saying?<eos> We...<eos> We... weren't blank pages, were we?<eos> Like your own would have been.<eos> You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.<eos> - I feel like, we're killing you.<eos> - I could have had kids.<eos> What?<eos> We chose not to have kids.<eos> We wanted the two of you.

What?<eos> We chose not to have kids.<eos> We wanted the two of you.<eos> That's what we wanted.<eos> We wanted the two of you in our lives.<eos> That's what we chose.<eos> That's one of the reasons, I fell in love with your dad.<eos> Because we both felt, as if... the world has enough people in it.<eos> Have a child, couldn't guarantee it will make anything better.<eos> But to take a child that's suffering like you boys were.
Summer in 1960.<eos> I did not know you were interested.<eos> - I am not.<eos> It says so here.<eos> But why are you guys so interested in the murder?<eos> The killer is still free after all these years.<eos> Is not that enough?<eos> How does it concern you?<eos> Do you get anything out of this stuff?<eos> What is it with you fanatic? Must everything be about sex?
LDA here.<eos> - She does not.<eos> Is everything ready, Atte?<eos> - Really soon.<eos> Fuck...!<eos> Come on.<eos> You promised we'd go swimming together.<eos> Clear. We should probably get started.<eos> No, damn it.<eos> - I can swim with you.
Come on.<eos> You promised we'd go swimming together.<eos> Clear. We should probably get started.<eos> No, damn it.<eos> - I can swim with you.<eos> If you ask nicely.<eos> - I mean it. We begin.<eos> Would you like to swim?<eos> - We do not have many hours left.<eos> I can swim with you.
- All right, I'll give you your hat back. - I need my playbook.<eos> - Give me that.<eos> - Hey! Quit screwing around!<eos> Round up!<eos> God!<eos> You don't bone tag your coach!<eos> All right now listen up.<eos> You all know the cheerleaders.<eos> They helped me prepare a little cheer.<eos> Especially for you guys.
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.<eos> What maters is, you need drugs,<eos> Harmon and I have some.<eos> Real premium shit too. - Amazing.<eos> - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You idiots go get free drugs, you'll be my best friends for life.
Biscuit's like tomato.<eos> I'm gonna go find Thad.<eos> You just enjoy it.<eos> Biscuit!<eos> What the fuck.<eos> Donnie!<eos> Donnie!<eos> Hey!<eos> Radon, stop the ride!<eos> It's just that, all it would take is one of you to show me respect as a coach and not just your friend and everyone else would be on board.
And can you comment on Thad Castle's open bashing of the late Walt Disney?<eos> He's called him, and I quote,<eos> "A short, anti-Semite... "with less imagination in his whole "Jew-hating body than I have in the tip of my pee-hole."<eos> He said "pee-hole?" - He did.<eos> - Well, you know,<eos> I don't think any of those allegations were proven to be true.<eos> So I don't want to comment on Mr...<eos> What about the drug use at Thadland?<eos> Why does Thad Castle hate the French?<eos> That's the question you idiots have?
Now, I admire the effort.<eos> I really do.<eos> Oh, look, here's Lyra, back from the dead.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, Lyra, troublesome as ever.<eos> You're not taking him.<eos> No, of course I'm not.<eos> I'm taking you all.<eos> You'll all come. You, your child.
It's just over that ridge.<eos> That's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us.<eos> - You are sure of that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal.<eos> Here's what we're doing.<eos> Hopefully the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.<eos> Bodhi, you're coming with me.<eos> We'll go up the ridge and check it out.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Hurry!<eos> Excellent news, Galen.<eos> The battle station is complete.<eos> You must be very proud.<eos> Proud as I can be, Krennic.<eos> Gather your engineers.<eos> I have an announcement.<eos> Is that all of them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Gentlemen, one of you... betrayed the Empire.
Excellent news, Galen.<eos> The battle station is complete.<eos> You must be very proud.<eos> Proud as I can be, Krennic.<eos> Gather your engineers.<eos> I have an announcement.<eos> Is that all of them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Gentlemen, one of you... betrayed the Empire.<eos> One of you has conspired with a pilot... to send messages to the Rebellion.
Rebels on Scarif.<eos> I need to speak with Admiral Raddus.<eos> He's returned to his ship.<eos> He's going to fight.<eos> No!<eos> Attention, all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> All flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> We have been redirected to Scarif.<eos> Pilots, you'll be briefed by your squadron leaders en route.<eos> May the Force be with you.
Someone's out there.<eos> Sir, we're detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace.<eos> Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?<eos> Lord Vader will handle the fleet.<eos> Target the base at Scarif, single reactor ignition.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Come on.<eos> You may fire when ready.<eos> Commence primary ignition.<eos> Rogue One, may the Force be with you.
How can you know what to do?<eos> You try.<eos> You love them.<eos> And I still love my daughter ri--<eos> Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but... I love her right now more than ever.<eos> - I hurt for her more now-- - I don't blame you... Mr. Levov.<eos> I don't blame either one of you.<eos> You didn't go out and buy the dynamite and make the bomb.<eos> You didn't plant the bomb.<eos> I feel badly for you both.
Mostly I'm self-taught.<eos> You can tell me if you're busy, but is that a Cray-1?<eos> Why yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> The first supercomputer.<eos> We get all of this on a cell phone now.<eos> -Yes. So you're an engineer?<eos> Am I an engineer?<eos> Instructor and counselor, too.<eos> I'm supposed to keep an eye on you CTs.
Berlin.<eos> Istanbul.<eos> Any server.<eos> The modern battlefield is everywhere.<eos> Which means you don't have to sit in a ditch eating MREs or dodging mortar fire.<eos> It means that if there is a another 9/11 it'll be your fault.<eos> Just as the last one was my generation's.<eos> Believe me, you do not want to live with that burden.<eos> We're gonna start with an aptitude test.<eos> Each of you is gonna build a covert communications network in your home city.
Well, shall I answer it?<eos> Tell them it's a wrong number.<eos> Yes?<eos> No I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Asked if I wanted turndown service and she said the "do not disturb" sign was off the door.<eos> So?<eos> Do we wait or go on our own?<eos> Look, I said from the beginning that how you publish is your business and I trust you.
After three months, I left too, I went back to Maryland.<eos> I promised her I'd change, and we moved back in together.<eos> Make sure your knees stay bent, and then you can fully extend once you feel stable. Ready? 1, 2, 3.<eos> All the way up.<eos> And you wanna clench between your knees.<eos> It'll burn, but it's a good burn.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Twirl around.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Oh my god, I'm so proud of you!
Inside the U.S.<eos> 3.1 billion e-mails and calls.<eos> That's not including any of the telco company data.<eos> Okay, so what's the collection in Russia?<eos> Russia is 1.5 billion.<eos> Wait, so we're collecting twice as much in the U.S. as we are in Russia?<eos> -Yeah, I figured it would be a lot, but...<eos> This shit is out of hand, man.<eos> Wait, have you shown this to anyone else?<eos> -No, you guys are the first.
I don't see Tibbo.<eos> No, no-no, wait, I think I see him.<eos> There's press swarming all over the hotel.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> I'll figure it out and I'll stop them with a press conference or something.<eos> Look, we really appreciate this you're one of the best lawyers in Hong Kong.<eos> We're gonna take him to the UN first, then I prefer not to reveal.<eos> I understand...<eos> Shit, they've spotted me.<eos> You guys get going.
We've made some promising breakthroughs with antitoxins.<eos> We...<eos> We've extracted the contaminant from the defective cells.<eos> We feel very confident...<eos> Ain't nobody even figured out what caused this shit-fest, man.<eos> And we counting' on these same fuckin' idiots to save us.<eos> - I heard it was in the water.<eos> - There were lice and Ebola mutations, brain parasites, the rapture.<eos> I've heard 'em all.<eos> What about you guys?
- Yes.<eos> - Can you?<eos> - Level 1 infections can be treated.<eos> Then, yeah.<eos> Fuck yeah.<eos> You save me, I'll save your family.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You wanna make it to the hospital...<eos> I go ahead of you, let you know if it's clear.
Cheers.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I'm 28, and I just moved back into my childhood bedroom.<eos> Mom and Dad are up my ass constantly, worried I'm gonna relapse.<eos> So no.<eos> - And you had to invite her?<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> She is a pain, but, you know, it's her birthday too.<eos> I didn't want her to be alone, and you guys used to be close.
- I know Beth would want you to have him.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> She's beautiful?<eos> I hope you are doing that around her. No.<eos> I...<eos> I stopped for her.<eos> But now why bother, right?<eos> She came by my place the day she died, upset.<eos> She said something attacked her.<eos> Was everything all right between you two?
That's nothing.<eos> Takes four to five minutes to strangle someone to death.<eos> Brain damage from lack of oxygen can occur after around three.<eos> What's all that?<eos> This is fluoride.<eos> It's normally used as an anesthesia.<eos> A little induces sleep, a lot and you'll never wake.<eos> I don't think we'll be needing that. So what's the plan?<eos> A large shot of adrenaline.<eos> If I administer this while the hag has contact, it will force you awake and should weaken its connection with you.
Yeah, no.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, you go ahead, you go ahead.<eos> I'm just going to two of these.<eos> Come talk to me while I'm in there.<eos> It'll help keep you awake.<eos> You got, like, a funny story you could tell or something?<eos> I'm not really known for my funny.<eos> How about... I don't know, something about you and Beth.<eos> I'm sure you guys had some wild adventures.
The whole world from your bedroom.<eos> What else do they want?<eos> Who's doing that?<eos> - I'm doing that.<eos> - You're doing that.<eos> Who was that guy in The Lighthouse?<eos> - The guy that offered you the gig?<eos> - Keith.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why was it so weird between you two?
But if he gets the bill out of my committee?<eos> It still has to go through the House, then out of Jim's committee before it even gets to the Senate floor.<eos> And none of this can get in the way of party unity.<eos> In this election, we can have a lock on the Senate and a lock on the House and we can elect a Southern Democrat president.<eos> It's about time the South rejoined the rest of the country.<eos> My friends, if we do our part,<eos> Lyndon is gonna know who to thank on November 4th.<eos> And don't you worry about the president.<eos> I know how to handle him.<eos> Well, the mainstream of American politics has carried you and me down to the road to statism and socialism and the destruction of the Constitution of the United States.
- Don't you tell me that ain't nothing, God damn it!<eos> - The liberal wing of the party<eos> - will think you've betrayed them. - Well, those are your people.<eos> - It's your job to bring them around.<eos> - My job? ! Hell, yes.<eos> You're the great white hope of liberals everywhere.<eos> Well, if I'm anything like what you say, it's because people know I stand by my principles. Principles?<eos> Shit.<eos> This ain't about principles, it's about votes!<eos> You know, that's the problem with you goddamn liberals...
Close don't make shit.<eos> You don't have the goddamn votes.<eos> Fine, what's your idea?<eos> What?<eos> I can't hear a goddamn thing you're saying, Humphrey.<eos> Come on over here.<eos> I said what's your idea?<eos> Well, right now it's all about the rules of the Senate.<eos> And Dick Russell's been studying them since he was sucking on his mama's titty.<eos> Boy, I've seen him make a fool of you liberals with some arcane rule of order more times than...
We're down five points in Georgia, six points in South Carolina, eight points in Louisiana.<eos> Hell, Goldwater is beating my ass by 60% in Mississippi.<eos> Now, he's getting on top!<eos> Son of a bitch is turning it around!<eos> Where the hell are the ideas?<eos> Where the hell's the solutions?<eos> Walter, I want you to change my travel schedule. Give me more time in the South, especially Louisiana.<eos> - And put more money into our TV campaign down there.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And as for the rest of you, what the hell are you still standing here for?
Then we'll only have to run it once, then let the press do our work for us.<eos> I wanna see it again.<eos> Now, Barry Goldwater says he's not a racist. But the government can't legislate what people feel in their hearts. - That's right!<eos> - And he's right.<eos> The law can't make white folks love you.<eos> But the law can prevent them from lynching you.<eos> The law can prevent them from denying you a job and your child an education.<eos> And the law can ensure that you have the right to vote.<eos> - Amen!<eos> I'm not here today to tell you fine people who to vote for.
How about that?<eos> Isn't that something?<eos> - Where's Lady Bird?<eos> - Right behind you where I've always been.<eos> Oh, 60 million votes.<eos> You're no accident, Mr. President.<eos> Mr. President, you've got a phone call from Senator Russell.<eos> Well, all right!<eos> Well, go on, go on, have some fun!<eos> I'll be with you in a second.
- Gabby?<eos> We're all good now.<eos> She's been asking for you.<eos> She was crying and vomiting.<eos> She had a uterine prolapse.<eos> Oh, I knew something was wrong.<eos> You were in so much pain.<eos> Hey, Molly.<eos> You're a mama.<eos> What am I going to do with all you guys?
Hey, you doing all right?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I am great.<eos> Not getting seasick on us, are you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> It's great.<eos> I can't even believe you get to come here all the time and do this.<eos> Hey, mind if we join you?
Love.<eos> Grand, isn't it?<eos> I was in love once.<eos> Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm here with a representative of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr. Bergen Paulsen.<eos> And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here.<eos> I understand that you're in town for the big show.<eos> Tell us a little bit about it.<eos> Take a look at this outstanding line-up we have here for you.
- Stop saying that. - I'd like to stop saying...<eos> - You said that. - I hear it.<eos> It's her protest group.<eos> - I don't hear you hearing it. Hey, Amelia?<eos> - Amelia?<eos> - Amelia?<eos> - She's not here.<eos> - She's here.<eos> Amelia.<eos> We can't talk to you.
It's her protest group.<eos> - I don't hear you hearing it. Hey, Amelia?<eos> - Amelia?<eos> - Amelia?<eos> - She's not here.<eos> - She's here.<eos> Amelia.<eos> We can't talk to you.<eos> Who said that?<eos> We can't talk to you.
I'm hip. But this is actually a really serious matter.<eos> So is this.<eos> We've all been killed.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> We're dead! They can't talk to you, man.<eos> They're dead.<eos> What's the protest about?<eos> Do you know?<eos> Any of you know why you're protesting?
Look, Amelia, we know you're here, so this is very...<eos> Hey, dickhead. She's not here.<eos> She's not here because of her boyfriend.<eos> Her boyfriend died, like, really died, like, three days ago.<eos> - Her boyfriend died?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So where is she?<eos> Sorry, can't help you. We're dead.<eos> God damn it.<eos> All right, which one of you cock and balls wants to make 20 bucks, huh?
Uh... Just chill here, you know. She's gotta come back down.<eos> Have a couple of cold ones on me?<eos> Oh, not for me.<eos> He makes a strong argument, though.<eos> You see?<eos> Reasonable. Very reasonable.<eos> Now, your buddy, that was the problem, he wasn't reasonable.<eos> Our buddy?<eos> Yeah, we don't have friends.<eos> The other guy looking for Amelia, he wasn't with you?
Oh, not for me.<eos> He makes a strong argument, though.<eos> You see?<eos> Reasonable. Very reasonable.<eos> Now, your buddy, that was the problem, he wasn't reasonable.<eos> Our buddy?<eos> Yeah, we don't have friends.<eos> The other guy looking for Amelia, he wasn't with you?<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> Got in the elevator right before you guys came in.
I'm trusting my instincts.<eos> I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere. Where?<eos> Floating in somebody else's pool?<eos> Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.<eos> Why give that up?<eos> I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.<eos> But the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people... I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.<eos> Besides, people tell me how they see me...<eos> - and it's not as a lawyer. - All right.<eos> - Here you go. - Thank you.
So Viktor with a K and Giselle, exotic names.<eos> - They're Dutch.<eos> - Well, Boer to be precise.<eos> Our father's side of the family is from South Africa... which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.<eos> South Africa, they grow them beautiful down there, right?<eos> Charlize Theron.<eos> - And you.<eos> - Oh, well.<eos> I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.<eos> Tell you what, when I'm done with you... - you might take your own private jet.
He seems to like it.<eos> Psychiatrist or pediatrician?<eos> - Little of both, I guess.<eos> - What are you doing out here?<eos> Same thing you guys are.<eos> Enjoying nature.<eos> Some of the best free climbing is right here in this valley.<eos> I hate heights.<eos> It's definitely not for everybody.<eos> So you don't mind if I sit here and chill out with you guys for a bit, do you?
Shit.<eos> Now that girl is hot.<eos> If you're askin' me, you gotta stay and party.<eos> Oh, you know, that's why we came here in the first place.<eos> Yeah, boy... ain't this some kind of wonderful... shit?<eos> I'd say that creep really did a number on your jeep here.<eos> Do you think you can get someone up here to fix it?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> I'll take care of you.
You're infected.<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Please.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Paul, don't leave!<eos> Paul, Paul, Paul.<eos> She's sick, okay?<eos> I'm doing this for you.<eos> I'm doing this for all of you.
No.<eos> At least you tried.<eos> Come on, everybody is waiting for you.<eos> Nobody's hungry?<eos> - Karen may have used those bowls.<eos> - Jesus, Jeff!<eos> I washed them.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> I'm not eating anything until we get to town.<eos> Now, anyone of you could have it.
Do us all a favor.<eos> The car is a fucking Petri dish.<eos> I'm not gonna ride in it.<eos> My mom will just give me a new one.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I cleaned it, it's fine.<eos> - Why don't you sleep in it?<eos> - Maybe I will. Alright.<eos> You guys are right.<eos> We should all just prepare our own meals 'cause I'm not cooking for you guys again.
That hermit guy touched you, huh?<eos> Well, did he or didn't he?<eos> Oh, fuck this.<eos> I'm getting help.<eos> Bert!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Jeff?<eos> - Hey, don't come near me.<eos> I told you not to move her because I don't wanna get sick.<eos> I don't want any of us to get sick but you fucking idiots insist on moving her and now you're covered in her blood.
It still looks boss.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay, I'll think about it.<eos> - I just have to clean it up a little.<eos> I'll think about it, King Dong, I'll think about it.<eos> Hey, oldie.<eos> Got any gas today?<eos> It's a cock-sucking gas station, ain't it?<eos> All right then, fill up this big bitch pronto.<eos> Any of you dumb cunts... in that ridiculous machine know how to read?
And all you have to do... is survive 12 hours... inside the walls of our own private little hell.<eos> And now... for the survival odds, as we see fit.<eos> Number one, 50 to 1.<eos> Number two, 500 to 1.<eos> Number three, 100 to 1.<eos> Number four, 60 to 1.<eos> Number five, 500 to 1.<eos> Now, what do you have to do to survive?<eos> Fear not.<eos> We have some very colorful heads for you tonight.
I do believe the first kill came rather quickly this year.<eos> I'm rather disappointed.<eos> The first one always does.<eos> It's the second one, the second one has all the drama.<eos> Well, I certainly hope we see a better showing from the remaining remnants.<eos> We shall see, we shall see.<eos> As we slip into our third hour of non-stop 31 action... come and enjoy some exquisite dining.<eos> You may want to try the steak kidney pie... followed by the apple crumble.<eos> Delicious.<eos> For one of you... this, of course, might be your last supper.
Let's get the fuck out of here.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I sincerely hope you all enjoyed... your protein-enriched nourishments.<eos> The first re-assessment of the standings are as follows.<eos> Number one, 50 to 1 odds.<eos> Number three at 90 to 1.<eos> Number two at 300 to 1.<eos> And last but not least is number five, 400 to 1.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages... with exactly nine hours left to play...<eos> I give you Psycho-Head and his brother... the maniacally mental Schizo-Head.
Look at these sorry sacks of wasted meat shit.<eos> Do we have your attention now, mother fuckers?<eos> You smell that?<eos> Well, I think they're already pissing in their pants. Yeah.<eos> Now, you think you got one over... because you took out that little shot glass bitch Sick-Head. Well, he isn't worth a shit.<eos> The only thing he's good for is shooting out of a fucking cannon.<eos> And I don't see a fucking cannon. Do you see a fucking cannon?<eos> No cannon.<eos> So that means you killed half a man.<eos> And it took five of you... to kill a little itty bitty baby.

Did you catch the murderer, Mr. Holmes?<eos> Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.<eos> I think we'll call it a draw.<eos> And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr. Watson.<eos> - Yes, did you enjoy it?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh? - I never enjoy them.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Well, I never say anything, do I?<eos> According to you, I just show people up the stairs and serve you breakfasts.
- Oh, campaign?<eos> - Votes for women.<eos> - And are you for or against?<eos> Get out.<eos> Oh, have they gone off again, have they?<eos> I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.<eos> Huh, yes.<eos> Those gentlemen!<eos> Oh, never you mind.<eos> Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.
Just observing, sir.<eos> Well, that's quite enough, nobody asked you to be observant.<eos> Sorry, sir, I just meant you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.<eos> You are dangerously close to impertinence.<eos> I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> And when will you be seeing her?<eos> Now, listen...<eos> Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.<eos> A telegram came for you.
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.<eos> - She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.<eos> - I'm sorry, what did you say?<eos> - I said no, she's not an hysteric.<eos> She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.<eos> My wife sees terror in an orange pip.<eos> Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see anything of value whatsoever.<eos> Can she really?<eos> And how do you "deduce" that, Mr. Holmes?<eos> She married you.
No.<eos> All the doors and windows to the house are locked.<eos> This is their only way out, I need you here!<eos> But the sound was so close.<eos> It had to be from this side of the house.<eos> Stay here!<eos> No!<eos> You promised to keep him safe.<eos> You promised!<eos> You...
Sir, what's up with those soldiers?<eos> What'll happen now?<eos> Yes, sir...<eos> Capital Defence Command is now in full control.<eos> Move aside!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> You bastards!<eos> I worked for my country!<eos> I'm different from you trash!
Yes, sir...<eos> Capital Defence Command is now in full control.<eos> Move aside!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> You bastards!<eos> I worked for my country!<eos> I'm different from you trash!<eos> You're all useless!<eos> I don't know how I got myself mixed up with you all!
Just purely as a last resort, in case you want to have, uh, your house reevaluated.<eos> I think that, um... I'm pretty sure there's a number on this pamphlet.<eos> Now, I'd like to introduce a dear friend and partner in New Day Alliance,<eos> James Harvey.<eos> Good job, Bob.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> You want to step here.<eos> You good?<eos> Thank you, Bob!<eos> And thank you all for being here.
"God, this man has been praying so long."<eos> "Why don't you let him win?"<eos> And God says, "I'd love to help him, but he's never bought... a lottery ticket."<eos> I look into this crowd, and I see different faces.<eos> I see old men and women.<eos> I see young couples.<eos> I see whole families.<eos> Now, why are you all here?<eos> Why are you all here?<eos> I used to live like you.

If we do indeed make contact with her, only one of us shall speak at a time.<eos> You must ask questions with a yes or no for an answer.<eos> One tap for no.<eos> And two taps for yes. Understood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let us join hands.<eos> Foul spirits be warned.<eos> Thou shall be banished if ye approach this circle.<eos> We only wish to contact whom we ask.<eos> You have been warned by all that is good and pure.
Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Hey!<eos> Easy with the stuff, guys.<eos> Jesus.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> I told you I don't want to see you smoking.<eos> I'm not a baby anymore, Dad, I can do whatever I want.<eos> Honey, I only want what's best for you.
Better be the food, I'm starving like a Marvin.<eos> - You don't look like you're starving.<eos> - Hey, how much?<eos> - I think your doorbell is busted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> $32.50... please.<eos> - Okay, there's $40.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> When did you guys move in?
I'd love to meet your wife.<eos> She recently passed. I'm still learning how to say that.<eos> Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Please.<eos> If you ever need help with the kids or if you just need some time alone, I'd be happy to watch them.<eos> Thank you, I appreciate that.<eos> Look at us, first time we meet and we're exchanging sob stories.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna bake up a cake and bring it over to you guys.
Um...<eos> Got it?<eos> Buddy, I think these eggs are spoiled.<eos> Or not. Um, how about some cereal?<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Hold that, I'll be right back. Fix yourself some cereal.<eos> Hello?<eos> Good morning.<eos> John.<eos> Sorry, I went around to the back to see if you guys were home.
I'll put you guys up in a hotel if I have to or you can move in with me.<eos> When do you start back up with work?<eos> Um, next week, I'm doing a remodel on a local business.<eos> - And the kids start school, too.<eos> - Don't you worry.<eos> I'll be there soon.<eos> I love you. - I love you, too.<eos> - I'll check in with you before I fly out.<eos> I knew I should have stayed out there after the funeral.<eos> You guys want to go see a movie?

Victor...<eos> Victoria?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> Victoria.<eos> The Three of Swords.<eos> It relates to heartache and sadness.<eos> - What the hell is going on in here?<eos> - Oh... I'm sorry. I...<eos> - Please leave! - Dad!<eos> No, I apologize, I rang the bell and... I told you kids not to play with this stuff.
It's time you fed.<eos> Danny?<eos> - Can't she stay?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Mommy?<eos> Don't hurt us.<eos> Mommy, is that you?<eos> Mommy?<eos> He killed us all!<eos> He will kill every one of you.
Drop her thing off while you're out.<eos> John.<eos> I love you.<eos> What was that?<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, how'd you feel if you never saw me again?<eos> That's exactly what would have happened if she'd have got out that window.<eos> Fix that shit up.<eos> Sergeant mathews: What were the circumstances of the separation?<eos> Just that if there was violence, - or if one of you was involved with someone else, you know...
- Please, try and relax.<eos> 99% of the time, these things sort themselves out.<eos> - If she's not back by Monday...<eos> - Monday?<eos> I mean, she's...<eos> What about those girls down there?<eos> Mrs. maloney, we're not in New York.<eos> Those girls, all runaways, all with stories just like this one.<eos> Now, I've got kids.<eos> I feel for you.
- Overpriced coffee. - Shitty, last-minute gifts.<eos> That's someone steaming milk.<eos> That's in a coffee shop.<eos> There's thousands in the city. We'll just never narrow it down in time.<eos> Hang on, maybe I can pull up some of the background noises.<eos> I have to say, Coffee Commune at 1287 Beverly Drive is my favorite coffee shop in town.<eos> That's right around the corner.<eos> We're there every day.<eos> He knows us.<eos> Istanbul, and it's as if I'm standing right next to you.
I don't want a new partner.<eos> It's you and me for the long haul, Geils.<eos> I mean, sure, things could change. Our jobs are dangerous, but I just want to let my guard down and be vulnerable and spend time with someone I really care about.<eos> You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about life, and it's really short.<eos> I just really want to... Tribeca, 42 seconds.<eos> Right, right, okay.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> All right, let's see what we got here.<eos> Hello, you have reached tech support for the all-American bomb company.<eos> There are six bombs ahead of you.
They burned us at the stake because they feared the erotic feelings we elicited in them.<eos> Later, they used marriage to hold us in bondage and made us into servants, whores, and fantasy dolls never asking us what we wanted.<eos> - They teach us that a normative human being is a hyper-rationalist, stoic male and that women's emotions and intuitions are illnesses that need to be cured.<eos> And we believe that men and women are different and that true equality lies in that difference.<eos> - We strive for male/female polarity and to regain our primal power as goddesses.<eos> We need to teach men how to love us using ways they can understand.<eos> So goddesses, use perfume, wear high heels and makeup, learn to dress your hair in attractive ways, display flesh artfully, and know what to conceal.<eos> Be a mother and a lover.<eos> Stand your ground, but always let the man feel like a man.<eos> - Use sex magic to destroy his fear of you and to open his heart to the floodgates of love.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - Much improvement since last time. - Thank you.<eos> Next.<eos> Dorottya Horvat.<eos> You're next.<eos> Good luck.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good, thank you. Jolly spiffing, tickety boo, never better.<eos> And you?
That was Father's story about Larry.<eos> It doesn't matter, Michael would love this.<eos> All of a sudden, Michael burst into a great big grin.<eos> "The Saddest Lion, I call A Villa in Antibes<eos> "because that's what it paid for."<eos> Michael, congratulations, my old mate.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen. Sadly, Sir Michael Gifford is unable to be present in person tonight.<eos> But it gives me great pleasure to introduce his beautiful daughter, Sophia, who will receive the award on his behalf.<eos> Thank you, Bernard.<eos> Thank you, Critics' Guild, and thank you all.
Here they are moving in on rebel-held government buildings in Elisabethville... capital of the province of Katanga.<eos> The world waits to see what General Tshombe will do next.<eos> Madame.<eos> Would it be possible to use your phone to place a call to Ireland?<eos> I'll pay, of course.<eos> I'm afraid my phone is not for military use.<eos> It's a personal call.<eos> I need to speak to my family.<eos> Of course.<eos> Everybody's been talking about you.
We're under attack!<eos> Somebody get out here!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get to the trenches!<eos> Man your positions!<eos> Move, move!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> You four, to me!
Fuck!<eos> Sniper.<eos> Go up to the trench now.<eos> Give us some cover.<eos> Go on.<eos> The rest of you, follow him.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Sir, there's nobody here.<eos> Because they're only coming from the east.<eos> Right, three of you stay here.

Please collect your equipment.<eos> - Straight Shooter.<eos> Welcome, Straight Shooter.<eos> Jesus, this is some pretty fancy shit.<eos> Interactive gaming units.<eos> I've read about stuff like this.<eos> Full immersion technologies.<eos> Bubble play.<eos> I thought this would only be for elites.<eos> I don't recognize any of you from the leader boards.
Ammo.<eos> Please proceed to the next level.<eos> Stay behind me.<eos> Floor 17.<eos> Medipak!<eos> - I'm out, Mustang!<eos> - Hold on, Reaper!<eos> Cover me!<eos> Shit!<eos> Don't say I never do anything for you, sweet cheeks.
Level reactivated.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Gotta keep playing.<eos> Floor 9.<eos> Recruits!<eos> Get in here now!<eos> Keep up.<eos> Many lives are at stake, gentlemen.<eos> There's a bomb wired to the foundations of this building.<eos> If it explodes, the building will collapse taking you with it.
I need ammo!<eos> Yo.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Fuck yeah, dude.<eos> - No Reaper, though. - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> He fought to the bitter end, do you know what I mean?<eos> Have you seen Taylor?<eos> Taylor, Slayer Girl, Taylor.<eos> - You guys get split up?
We... we did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> We made it, Shelly.<eos> Recruits... today you have earned your place in history.<eos> Fortune truly does favor the brave.<eos> You have made strong and proved you could stay the course.<eos> You have what all men covet... but few will ever know.<eos> A bond found only in each other.<eos> A brother in arms.<eos> I am proud of each and every one of you.
But does your boyfriend know the difference between pi to the third decimal point, and pi to the fifteenth decimal point?<eos> It has truly been an honor to meet you.<eos> And you are really one of the greatest minds of our generation.<eos> Bye.<eos> Look, everybody.<eos> I got a cowboy.<eos> Look at those muscles, am I right?<eos> Wow.<eos> Cheese!<eos> There's so many of you.
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.<eos> That is cool.<eos> Do I have one?<eos> Hey, Rock, who is that?<eos> O'Neil.<eos> Get that canister!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> You guys don't really want to do this again, right?<eos> It doesn't usually work out well for you guys.
- What are you, chicken?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Who are you calling chicken, turtle?<eos> Look, do you want to find Bebop and Rocksteady or not?<eos> So we're breaking into police headquarters.<eos> We got one last boondoggle.<eos> We need to find someone to sneak you guys past security checkpoint.<eos> Only plan I got so far may be a tad less than appetizing.<eos> Are we going somewhere?<eos> I'm gonna take a photo with all of you, don't worry, everybody's gonna get one tonight.
Thirty minutes.<eos> See you there.<eos> - See you there.<eos> - He just said that.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Look who it is.<eos> Vern "The Falcon" Fenwick!<eos> Let's take a picture, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, I'll just take one and send it to all you guys.
We're being hunted.<eos> They think we're monsters.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna need the cops at our backs.<eos> They're trying to lock us up.<eos> Unless...<eos> One sip, and we'll stay the same on the inside, but look like humans on the outside.<eos> Your boyhood is drawing to an end.<eos> You are becoming young men.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> I'll do whatever you guys say.
Turtle power!<eos> Escaped convicts Bebop and Rocksteady are now in police custody, while Dr. Baxter Stockman remains at large.<eos> Authorities assure us that the city is once again safe, however questions remain about last week's events.<eos> What was that threat from the sky and how exactly was it averted?<eos> But the bigger question is, does it even matter?<eos> Do we need to give our heroes a name and a face?<eos> Or is it enough to know that they're out there watching over us from the shadows?<eos> For your incredible valor within this community, and for your uncompromising cooperation with this agency,<eos> I present to you the keys to the city, a symbol of our appreciation, respect, and for our continued partnership.<eos> To you brothers,
We knew from the road show... the demand for the stock was going to be strong.<eos> We expected to see a pop at the open.<eos> But nobody thought Dynacorps would soar like this... all the way to 47, and it looks like it is still climbing... at this hour, so a much better debut... than investors could have hoped for.<eos> Of course, with this kind of move... you wonder whether the stock may have been mispriced... whether or not perhaps they left a little money on the table.<eos> We know that they actually switched underwriters... going into this IPO, so there was a bit of concern... about how things would shake up, but clearly Dynacorps' IPO... is shaping up to be one of the most successful... public offerings of the year.<eos> So what happened with Dynacorps?<eos> Neel, I have taken nine Silicon Valley companies public in the last five years... and you want to talk about the one I didn't take to the finish line?<eos> I work for the largest investment bank in the world.<eos> We both know I found you guys capital... when you were just a couple kids with a laptop and a dream.<eos> So we can talk about Dynacorps... or we can talk about you... and how I'm gonna grow your company... so you can build technology that will transform people's lives.
Know what?<eos> We really should get together.<eos> It's been forever.<eos> I would love that.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - I'll, um...<eos> - I'll see you on the panel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See you up there.<eos> I'm wondering, for each of you, what's that thing that really makes you... want to get up in the morning?
- I look forward to it.<eos> We both know your client crossed a line. Heh.<eos> Would you look at him?<eos> He works 80 hours a week.<eos> He's a dad, raises money for leukemia research.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Does he plant daffodils too?<eos> Well, he's got no history.<eos> He's never been flagged by you guys or the SEC.
They have a long reach.<eos> So...<eos> Hold...<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Tell Ed not to make a public statement, okay?<eos> I appreciate his enthusiasm, but just...<eos> Look, wake the fuck up and call me.<eos> So this is a big day for you and your shareholders.
Oh, no one's afraid of me.<eos> I am. After what you said to me at the mortuary, remember?<eos> Am I right, that's inadmissible?<eos> That's "heresy," right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Disregard Ms. Kapoor's last statement.<eos> This is an order of protection issued against you by your wife, Michelle.<eos> Yeah, that's before we got back together.<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> I'm happy for you both, you managed to resolve that somehow.
Fucking get...<eos> Fuck!<eos> You under any unusual stress?<eos> You could say that.<eos> Who gave you this?<eos> Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.<eos> Canal Street.<eos> Did he also offer to re-tar your driveway?<eos> Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks, confusion, and psychosis, you don't want to make a habit out of this.<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you. This isn't what I normally do.
Oh, yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everybody down.<eos> Put your palms on the floor.<eos> Everybody down.<eos> Put your palms on the floor.<eos> Everybody down.<eos> Put your palms on the floor.<eos> Cell phones out.<eos> Place them in front of you.

Keyword there is was, T.J. Jackson's dead.<eos> James Jackson is T.J.'s little brother.<eos> We figured James had some of T.J.'s old stuff, T.J. was a US ranger hotshot.<eos> So maybe he had some of this high tech shit and they used it. - Huh.<eos> - That's what you two figured?<eos> That they'd be that precise but not take the time to wipe it off?<eos> These are thugs.<eos> Did you see the tape?<eos> These guys move better than a SWAT team.<eos> No, if I were looking for thugs, my first suspects would be you assholes.
Yeah, I'm sure, I can handle any early birds.<eos> - Thanks, what can I get you?<eos> - Just a coffee would be great.<eos> Strong feather.<eos> Open box 3-5-1-1-1.<eos> Wait!<eos> Don't!<eos> Will, get down!<eos> On the ground.<eos> Cell phones in front of you.

I'm sorry for the detective, Chris.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Look, I work close to the bank, SUV peels out, cop cars show up,<eos> I wrote it down, if you guys aren't interested, it's cool.<eos> Oh, no, no, we're interested.<eos> We'd love to see the plate number.<eos> I wrote it down.<eos> Address and the location where I saw them. Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you come sooner with that information?<eos> I called right away, you guys were the first ones to get back to me.
- Were you and your brother close?<eos> - Very close.<eos> - You have any brothers?<eos> - I do actually.<eos> I was 20 years older than him.<eos> I loved him dearly.<eos> Died far too young.<eos> Twenty-four.<eos> He didn't seem to follow in the family footsteps however.<eos> All of you with your Business and Law degrees and Alexander, - is a Philosophy major at Dartmouth?
Keep moving.<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Down!<eos> Move, move, move, let's go!<eos> Move it out, move it out now!<eos> Lower your weapons and we will not harm you.<eos> No, what are you doing?<eos> Down here!<eos> I'll fucking kill her, I'll fucking do it, I'll fucking kill her!<eos> So which one of you creeped up on my computer last night?
Can't remember ordering anybody to be locked up, but I'm sure if you give me time I can find some reasons to put you away.<eos> They don't pay you enough money to get a real suit?<eos> Go back to that shitty bar that you hang out and order that shitty wine that you never drink.<eos> Tell me something, at what age was Alexander supposed to receive his inheritance?<eos> 'Cause my guess is 25.<eos> Tragic he died two months before then.<eos> Fuck's the matter with you?<eos> There it is.<eos> No movement since I called you.<eos> Okay, you guys hang here, me and the stiff will go check it out.
This child... this one is all that will be left of me... ever.<eos> But now, we must go, so I beg you, Claire...<eos> No, no, I can't leave you.<eos> You heard me give my word to Rupert, and you made me a promise to spare Randall's life.<eos> You... you promised me that if it came to this, ye'd go back through the stones, back home.<eos> But you are my home.<eos> And you are mine, but this home is lost.<eos> And now you and the bairn... you must go to a safe place.<eos> To a man...<eos> A man that could care for you both.
He dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.<eos> 'And on his son, young John, 'Of whom, two hours since, news did arrive<eos> 'That he is speeding to his warlike father.'<eos> Come, go.<eos> I will dispatch the horsemen straight.<eos> Within six hours, they will be at his aid.<eos> Too late comes rescue:<eos> he is ta'en or slain.<eos> If he be dead... .. brave Talbot, then adieu!<eos> His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
To send such peevish tokens to a king.<eos> Bring forth the sorceress.<eos> No!<eos> Tie her to the stake!<eos> For she has lived too long, To fill the world with vicious qualities.<eos> First, let me tell you who you have condemn'd...<eos> Not me begotten of a shepherd swain, But issued from the progeny of kings, chosen from above,<eos> To work exceeding miracles on earth.<eos> I never had to do with wicked spirits!<eos> But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
Pardon me, gracious lord,<eos> A sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart<eos> And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.<eos> Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.<eos> "And she be sent over at the King of England's own cost "without having any dowry."<eos> They please us well.<eos> Thanks, Uncle Winchester.<eos> Come, let us in.<eos> Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,<eos> To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief.
And are the cities, that I got with wounds, Delivered up again with peaceful words?<eos> France should have torn and rent my very heart, Before I would have yielded to this league.<eos> I never read but England's kings have had Great sums of gold and dowries with their wives.<eos> And our King Henry gives away his own, To match with her that brings no vantages.<eos> She should have stayed in France and starved in France!<eos> My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot.<eos> My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind, 'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike, But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.<eos> Lordings, farewell, and say, when I am gone, I prophesied France will be lost ere long.<eos> So, there goes our Protector in a rage.<eos> 'Tis known to you he is mine enemy, Nay, more, an enemy unto us all, And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.
Noble she is, but if she have forgot Honour and virtue and conversed with such I banish her my bed and company<eos> That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.<eos> Well, for this night we will repose us here.<eos> To-morrow toward London back again, To look into this business thoroughly.<eos> - Come on. - No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham.<eos> In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:<eos> Receive the sentence of the law for sin Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.<eos> You, madam, for you are so nobly born,
Oh, Uncle Gloucester, 'tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspect.<eos> My conscience tells me he is innocent.<eos> Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:<eos> Virtue is choked with foul ambition.<eos> I know their complot is to have my life,<eos> And if my death might make this island happy, And prove the period of their tyranny, I would expend it with all willingness.<eos> But mine is made the prologue to their play, For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril, Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.<eos> Somerset's red eyes blab his heart's malice,<eos> Thou Winchester, that reaches at the moon, Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back, By false accuse does level at my life.<eos> And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
Madam, with reverence may I say, For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignity.<eos> Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour!<eos> Thy mother took unto her blameful bed Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art.<eos> Exeter.<eos> Why, how now, lords!<eos> Your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence!<eos> Dare you be so bold?<eos> Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?<eos> The traitorous York Set all upon us, mighty sovereign.<eos> If Somerset and Suffolk be not done to death, Or banished fair England's territories, The people will by violence tear them from you.
For I were loath<eos> To link with him that were not lawful chosen.<eos> Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.<eos> Our sister shall be Edward's.<eos> Until today, Louis WAS Henry's friend.<eos> And still is friend to him and Margaret.<eos> And shall you have all kindness at my hand<eos> That your estate requires and mine can yield.<eos> Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.<eos> My Lord of Warwick, this letter is for you, sent from your brother.

Ay, what of that?<eos> It was my will and grant, And for this once, my will shall stand for law.<eos> And yet methinks Your Grace hath not done well<eos> To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride.<eos> She better would have suited me than Rivers.<eos> Alas poor Clarence<eos> Is it for a wife that thou art malcontent?<eos> Well, I will provide thee.<eos> And in choosing for yourself you've shown your judgment, Which being shallow, you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf.<eos> And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. Simple, plain Clarence!<eos> I do love thee so, that shortly I will send thy soul... to Heaven.<eos> Good time of day to you, Lord Chamberlain.<eos> What news?<eos> The King is sickly, weak and melancholy, And his physicians fear him mightily.<eos> He broke the feast and has returned to bed.<eos> Oh, he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consumed his royal person.<eos> - Where is he? In his bed?<eos> - He is.<eos> Go you before, and I will follow you.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass, And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body.<eos> Since I have crept in favour with myself, I will maintain it at some little cost.<eos> Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass.<eos> Have patience, sister.<eos> There's no doubt His Majesty will soon recover his accustomed term.<eos> If he were dead, what would betide on me, brother?<eos> No other harm but loss of such a lord.<eos> The loss of such a lord includes all harms.<eos> The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son, Mother, To be your comforter when he has gone.<eos> Ah, he is young and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, A man that loves not me nor none of you.
Or thee, Lord Rivers?<eos> Or thee, Elizabeth?<eos> Or any of your faction?<eos> A plague upon you all.<eos> His royal grace cannot rest scarce a breathing-while<eos> But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.<eos> Come, come.<eos> We know your meaning, brother Gloucester.<eos> You envy my advancement and my friends'.<eos> God grant we never may have need of you.

Which oft I have endured.<eos> Tell him, and spare not.<eos> Lord, I have said I will avouch it in Edward's presence.<eos> Ere you were Queen, aye, or your husband King, I was the packhorse in his great affairs.<eos> To royalise his blood, I spilt mine own!<eos> I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's.<eos> I'm too childish-foolish for this world.<eos> Hear me, you wrangling pirates,<eos> That fall out in sharing that which you have pilled from me!<eos> Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
Beware of him.<eos> What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?<eos> - Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. - Mm.<eos> What?<eos> Dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?<eos> And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?<eos> O, but remember this another day, When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow<eos> And say, "Poor Margaret<eos> "was a prophetess."<eos> Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.<eos> Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.<eos> - My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks.<eos> If all this will not do,<eos> I'll drown you in the bucket.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Why, so, now have I done a good day's work.<eos> You peers, continue this united league.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Why, so, now have I done a good day's work.<eos> You peers, continue this united league.<eos> Rivers and Hastings dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.<eos> By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,<eos> And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.<eos> So thrive I, as I truly swear the like.<eos> Madam, yourself is not exempt from this. Nor you, stepson Grey. Buckingham, nor you.
All heaven, what a world is this!<eos> Is Clarence dead?<eos> The order was reversed.<eos> But he, poor man, by your first order died, And that a winged Mercury did bear, Some tardy cripple bore the countermand<eos> And came too lag to see him buried.<eos> Who sued to me for him?<eos> Who, in my wrath, kneeled at my feet And bade me be advised?<eos> Who spoke of brotherhood?<eos> Who spoke of love?<eos> All of this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully plucked, And not a man of you had so much grace to put it in my mind.

I crave your blessing.<eos> God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast; Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.<eos> Amen.<eos> You here that bear this heavy load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other's love.<eos> Meseemeth good, that with some little train, Forthwith from Ludlow the young Prince be fetched Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.<eos> Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?<eos> Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,<eos> Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd.<eos> Then be it so, and go we to determine Who they shall be that shall straight to Ludlow.<eos> Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
How doth the Prince?<eos> Oh, well, madam, and in health.<eos> Then what is thy news?<eos> Lord Rivers and Lord Grey Are sent to Pomfret, prisoners.<eos> Who hath committed them?<eos> The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.<eos> For what offence?<eos> The sum of all I can I have disclos'd.<eos> Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,<eos> How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
Long live Richard, England's worthy King!<eos> Tomorrow may it please you to be crown'd?<eos> Even when you please, for you will have it so.<eos> And so most joyfully we take our leave.<eos> And I will to my holy work again.<eos> Farewell, my cousin, farewell, gentle friends.<eos> Open this gate!<eos> Who meets us here?<eos> God give your graces both A happy and a joyful time of day.<eos> - As much to you, good sister.
I say again.<eos> Give out that Anne my Queen is sick and like to die.<eos> For it stands upon me To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.<eos> About it.<eos> Is thy name Tyrell?<eos> James Tyrell, and your most obedient subject.<eos> Art thou, indeed?<eos> Prove me, my gracious lord.<eos> Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?<eos> So please you. I'd rather kill two enemies.
They have not been commanded, mighty King.<eos> Pleaseth Your Majesty to give me leave, I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace Where and what time Your Majesty shall please.<eos> Ay, ay.<eos> Thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond.<eos> But I'll not trust thee.<eos> Most mighty sovereign, You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:<eos> I never was nor never will be false.<eos> Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind your son, George Stanley.<eos> Look your heart be firm. Or else his head's assurance is but frail.<eos> So deal with him as I prove true to you.
If you do free your children from the sword, Your children's children requite it in your age.<eos> One who never in his life Felt so much cold as o'er shoes in snow?<eos> Let's whip these stragglers o'er seas again.<eos> In the name of God and all these rights...<eos> - Shall we let them enjoy our lands?<eos> - Nay! - Lay with our wives?<eos> - Nay!<eos> Ravage our daughters?<eos> Draw your willing swords...<eos> For if we thrive, The gain of our attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof.
Somebody has a new fleet of warships.<eos> I'm not a pilot, someone else needs to fly.<eos> I don't think I'm in any condition to...<eos> - Get us out of here! - You got it.<eos> You will be granted safe harbor on Tycho.<eos> You have my solemn promise that you will not be harmed.<eos> I've known guys with causes.<eos> Causes that get people killed.<eos> You don't show up anywhere without a reason.<eos> I don't work for you fine people anymore.
You two are the only witnesses to a series of catastrophic events.<eos> You could be the key to stopping all-out war.<eos> We're not the only witnesses.<eos> You were watching. I've been out of the war business a long time, son.<eos> I broker peace treaties these days...<eos> Not exactly what you're known for...<eos> You can put those guns away.<eos> Tell the others to come out.<eos> I'll give you safe harbor.<eos> And I'll get rid of that ship for you.
You can put those guns away.<eos> Tell the others to come out.<eos> I'll give you safe harbor.<eos> And I'll get rid of that ship for you.<eos> No one's getting rid of our ship.<eos> Martian vessels come through Tycho on a daily basis.<eos> If they see that frigate parked there, it's a bad day for me too.<eos> I'm just the messenger, I have half a platoon of pissed-off Martian marines who are just itching for some payback.<eos> Huh. That's a corvette-class Martian frigate that typically crews thirty.<eos> I only see two of you.
_<eos> Hands where I can see them!<eos> Transporting any weapons?<eos> No, what's the problem, bosmang?<eos> Show us your transponder.<eos> Says here it's expired.<eos> What happened, pebble jockey?<eos> Did you get drunk and forget to renew your license?<eos> I didn't have the scrip, kopeng, I had to replace the...<eos> Yeah, you Belters always got an excuse.
When you arrive on Eros, your cargo will be held under lien until your fines are paid in full.<eos> Oh, come on, there must be something...<eos> - Hey! - Leave him alone.<eos> Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet! Why are you doing this?<eos> Impound our haul and there's nothing left for your taxman.<eos> Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...
Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> What god gives you the right to life's riches, huh?<eos> You set up your zones and tell us where we can and cannot go.<eos> You living belly-full, with your glass palaces, while half my people are starving to death.<eos> How is this justice?<eos> You Skinnies wanna take credit for blowing' up the Donnager, we'll give you justice.
Like I said, I grew up in places like this.<eos> I was married.<eos> Out on a run, all I could think about was getting back home.<eos> And lying in my bed, all I could dream about was getting back out here.<eos> Big brass said I didn't have what it takes to fly their badass gun-ships...<eos> But I'll tell you one thing, flying the Rocinante back there, that was just about the best feeling I have ever had.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> The ship will look like a run-of-the-mill gas freighter.<eos> Don't fly too close, but don't try to avoid it.<eos> The Martian patrols won't give you a second look.
- Whoa, wait a minute...<eos> - Fresh air it is.<eos> - Just wait a minute!<eos> - Keep him there.<eos> Disable the controls so he can't get out.<eos> - Just wait a minute!<eos> - Let's hope we don't open the wrong door. Just wait! Look!<eos> Look!<eos> We need to help each other out here, okay?<eos> Now I don't want to get picked up by any Mickie patrol, and I know you guys don't want that either.
I don't care.<eos> You think the Martians are gonna buy whatever story you're selling?<eos> Will you shut him up, please? No, look, you need to...<eos> Talk some more.<eos> You got a good right.<eos> You use it too much, but you got a good right.<eos> Enough!<eos> Get him below.<eos> ...it's time to ask yourself what you can do for the Belt.<eos> The OPA wants you.
Roger that.<eos> There you go.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> As soon as we hit dock, I'm gonna be pulling this entire system...<eos> Your data's corrupted, Rocinante.<eos> Please re-send.<eos> There you go.<eos> Rocinante, you have been flagged for inspection per MCR Trade Regulation A0-66.<eos> Do not deviate from your present course.<eos> If you do, you will be fired upon.
Well done.<eos> I've still got to pee, if anyone's interested.<eos> Secure for prisoner.<eos> Is this really necessary?<eos> You have something useful to say, say it.<eos> All right, you're flying around in a Martian frigate with a bunch of junk welded to it. Congrats.<eos> But it's not gonna fool that skiff once they get on board and see all this.<eos> That wasn't useful, that's bloody obvious.<eos> This is a game.<eos> This is a game of pretend. And you guys are pretending to be the wrong thing.

And you guys are pretending to be the wrong thing.<eos> The Mickies have been known to disguise their attack ships when they're doing covert ops.<eos> They use a special set of codes that tell other Martian ships that they are out there, they're doing the nasty, and to get lost.<eos> - How do you know all this?<eos> - I'm a good spy.<eos> Which is why I don't want to mess with the Mickies any more than you guys do.
Who has ships like that?<eos> Mars, of course.<eos> But this is not a design I've seen before, - must be one of the newer.<eos> - It's not Martian.<eos> No one else builds stealth, no one else can afford to.<eos> This is what Fred Johnson sent you out here to find.<eos> - I don't think he knew it was out here.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> A dead stealth ship sitting next to a rock looks just like a rock, unless you know exactly where to look.<eos> You guys are out here to salvage this.
Break it on your feet!<eos> Towalda supposed to go to shelter. Hey!<eos> You go quiet and go now, else we throw you in there, ourselves.<eos> Help me up.<eos> My neck. Come on.<eos> Here's your problem, asshole.<eos> That just made me feel better.<eos> Turn around.<eos> My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson.<eos> Many of you know me, one way or another.

Let's go rage, Dee.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> I-I'm, like, so lost.<eos> So, uh, who do I go with in this situation?<eos> Well, that depends, Charlie.<eos> You could go drink cheap beer amongst swine and savages, like you would on any other day, or... you could get the most out of this mountain. And you could get the most out of yourself by joining an elite class of athletes and gentlemen alike.<eos> Right, Frank?<eos> Yes. Huh.<eos> That sounds kind of cool. Yeah.<eos> All right, you guys go-- why should I go with you?
You forgot one charge.<eos> What's that?<eos> Assaulting an officer!<eos> Never stop partying!<eos> That'll do. You know?<eos> Let them keep thumping ass.<eos> He probably deserves it. Yeah.<eos> Never stop partying.<eos> Never stop partying!<eos> So... which one of you losers wants to win a silver medal? Ugh.
Are you a mind reader as well?<eos> No, but I have an excellent memory for names, and, uh... yes... I've recently heard yours in connection with your rather dramatic arrival on our shores.<eos> Comte St. Germain told me all about your part in the burning of his pox-afflicted vessel, "The Patagonia."<eos> You're friends with the Comte St. Germain?<eos> Au contraire. You may, shall I call us, rivals.<eos> A pleasant term for enemies, is it not?<eos> And since he's your enemy as well, you must, in point of fact, be my friend.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Accept this mixture as my gift to you and your husband.
You ask of the clans?<eos> Well, sire, the truth of it is, the clans canna agree on the color of the sky, let alone put aside their old grievances and band together to fight the British.<eos> No, sire... they're not ready to hear the call of the pipes nor likely to be so for many years to come.<eos> I dare say... If that is the truth... it is one I have yet to hear.<eos> Damnable defeatist talk is what it sounds like and very peculiar coming from a supposed Jacobite.<eos> - Ooh, monsieur...<eos> I assure you, sire... I hate the English as much as any man.<eos> I carry the scars of 200 lashes on my back that remind me of the fact every day.<eos> You asked for the truth, and the truth is what I gave you.<eos> Would you rather I whispered honeyed words of reassurance in your ear, words that would lead you... lead all of Scotland... to disaster?
Is that cause enough for a cotter to exchange his scythe for a sword, to leave his home, his crops, and charge into a cannon's blast?<eos> It would appear you have now heard the truth from two loyal Scots.<eos> And what about God's truth?<eos> For His is the only truth that matters, is it not?<eos> I tell you both... it is God's will that I, Charles Stuart, unite the clans.<eos> It is God's will that I be the beacon of light, for I am, by divine right, the outstretched hand of God.<eos> Our cause shall succeed, but it cannot move forward without money, and money it shall have.<eos> But to get it, we must win the support of the French Minister of Finance, a certain Joseph Duverney.<eos> As I am in this country unofficially, I cannot be received at Court.<eos> But you, my Lord Broch Tuarach...
Oh, a man of rather gross sensibilities.<eos> But fear not, if he is here, I shall find him.<eos> _<eos> Annalise.<eos> Claire... _ _<eos> Annalise de Marrilac.<eos> Annalise... _<eos> Claire Fraser.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Let me congratulate you on having won such a strong, passionate man for a husband.
I understand he's stocking. I must have a case.<eos> Hmm. How much?<eos> I'd be willing to pay 20% over the asking price.<eos> Sold.<eos> On credit, no doubt.<eos> Jamie, why don't you take Murtagh to have a drink with our new friend, the Minister of Finance?<eos> I see you're already cultivating important people in high places.<eos> How very in keeping with your character.<eos> Poor Jamie, he must be missing Scotland terribly.<eos> I suppose it's no longer a safe haven for either of you.
Would you read it to me?<eos> Pardon?<eos> 'Countess Fujiwara Hideko'<eos> This is your name.<eos> Can't you read it?<eos> What's with your foot?<eos> Who did it?<eos> Who took Tamako's shoe?<eos> Apologise before all the servants!<eos> If she ever runs away because of one of you,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Pork butt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me get the biggest piece you got, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And trim all that fat off, homie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know I like my butt to be firm, feel me?<eos> You know, for some reason I just feel like you one of them brothers that's been violated before, you know?
Why are you traveling around the world?<eos> I guess I'm running away from time.<eos> Time?<eos> Humans are the only ones who trap themselves by allocating life into hours and minutes. even strapped to our wrists.<eos> My father repairs watches for a living.<eos> sorry 'bout that.<eos> I'm going to live my life!<eos> Live it for all it's worth! you learn that much in the world is cruel. you realize an equal number of beautiful things exist.<eos> I envy you.<eos> Like meeting you guys.
He's a really important contact for me.<eos> I'm freaking out with these Chinese wannabe investors.<eos> - Are you coming on Monday?<eos> - Text me where.<eos> - Yeah, the DaVinci, 9 p.m.? - Yeah.<eos> Very good.<eos> Very good.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Hey, let's go to the restroom.<eos> And you?
I'll finish it. I'll bring it to you.<eos> I'm going now.<eos> I have to leave now. Thank you very much.<eos> It was really interesting with the painting.<eos> Maybe we can sing a song for you and for your family?<eos> Just to say "thank you."<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay. It will be nice.<eos> Let's be polite for once and bring this to an end.<eos> Mon secrétaire and I we will sing a song for you.
I know. Family.<eos> I'm so sorry. I mixed up the time.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> I'm Lili.<eos> I hope it's okay that we started bringing the stuff up?<eos> Of course. It's totally okay.<eos> No problem.<eos> We will bring the food tomorrow.<eos> So thank you very much that you choose Darius Catering.<eos> No, thank you! It's great.
Must be big<eos> Chloe, Vivien ...<eos> There they are.<eos> Take.<eos> Take, take ! .<eos> - Vivien Parker Moats?<eos> - Chloe Moats?<eos> - Yes, it's me.<eos> And I'm Vivien Parker Moats<eos> No, before they say anything, right in front of you Two women who defend the generations who came before them.
It can do you no harm.<eos> Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol.<eos> It's against his religion.<eos> On this occasion, I will make an exception so I can toast Prince Kipiani.<eos> Thank you, young man.<eos> Prince Kipiani.<eos> Prince Kipiani.<eos> You must go and look at our gardens after dinner, Ali Khan.<eos> We have the most beautiful ancient trees.<eos> Thank you, Your Highness, but I came to visit you, not your trees.
What did you say?<eos> That I'm in love with you.<eos> That I've always been in love with you.<eos> You should get back together with him.<eos> I want to be with you through this.<eos> I want to spend the rest of your life with you.<eos> Come on, Marc, jump already.<eos> Rebecca's looking this way. Waiting to see that swan dive. Way to go, dude.<eos> Now he's gonna bellyflop.<eos> What do you guys think about cryonization?
I know. And I agree. There were problems at first.<eos> I mean, now it depends on how well prepared you are.<eos> For example, the money question, I'm gonna set aside a lot more.<eos> I'm gonna set all of my money aside.<eos> Why do you think that anybody from the future would want to bring you back to life? Or anybody else for that matter?<eos> The world is gonna be totally overpopulated. You'll be like a man from the 19th century.<eos> I mean, what's the point of that? Unless they wanna use you as guinea pigs for science.<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up. No.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I wanted to talk to you two about it.
You'll never move at the speed and accuracy of a teenager. And I can't promise you that new complications won't arise. But with luck, they won't be any more serious than those experienced by patients with chronic diseases or by the elderly.<eos> The elderly?<eos> Marc... I understand your fear. But I have to ask you to be strong and not to let it get the better of you.<eos> And don't you forget, we're all here to support you. That you're not alone.<eos> Don't you realize the importance of our achievement?<eos> It's a giant step in the history of medicine.<eos> You're that giant step, Marc.<eos> You'd better prepare yourself.<eos> You're gonna be the most famous person on the planet.<eos> I don't know if any of you, maybe some of the oldest, have seen any films about Jesus Christ.
Right foot.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Okay, follow my finger.<eos> Alright, blink once if you can hear me.<eos> Please follow my finger.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tonight will most certainly go down in history.<eos> And all of you with it.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tonight will most certainly go down in history.<eos> And all of you with it.<eos> 'Cause we have done it.<eos> The journey has been replete with prejudice, legal barriers, doubts and sacrifice.<eos> But we overcame.<eos> We have made possible the dream long held by humanity, in his struggle against disease and time.<eos> And we couldn't have done it without you... Our investors, stockholders, allies, collaborators...

Our investors, stockholders, allies, collaborators...<eos> Scratch that. Without you, we couldn't even have begun to dream.<eos> - That is why tonight...<eos> - How are you?<eos> The painkillers should have taken effect by now.<eos> Not only does this day position Prodigy as a leader in our field...<eos> And you will be compensated for your generosity and boldness. But most importantly, because of what our advancements mean for humanity.
To bring you back to life, Marc.<eos> Do you still not see how important it is?<eos> I can't stop you from talking about what you saw in those recordings.<eos> I won't.<eos> But Prodigy's standing is very fragile at the moment. And if you talk about it, Project Lazarus will go bankrupt.<eos> That's the bottom line, Marc.<eos> The failed reanimations are my responsibility and I have to live with that. But you have another responsibility as the key to the project.<eos> You get to decide whether or not humanity will ever have a chance to benefit from it.<eos> Were they part of humanity?<eos> Maybe not to you people.
I have done everything I can to treat you and ease your pain.<eos> I can't give you a better life than the one I already have.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Maybe that's the part you can't take.<eos> That the life I gave you isn't the one you were expecting.<eos> You wanted paradise for a few thousand dollars, and I only gave you the life you already have, with all its defects and all its limitations.<eos> I might have a body that's loaded with defects, but I noticed I'm pretty strong.<eos> I know.<eos> I created your muscles.<eos> And I see you people from the outside, and I don't...

You're the only one I can turn to, Elizabeth.<eos> Why should I help you?<eos> 'Cause you've seen everything I have.<eos> 'Cause you understand what I feel better than you'd like.<eos> Because I need for all of this to mean something.<eos> Because I'm all alone.<eos> Because you love me.<eos> The plan is simple.<eos> In the next few days, I'll follow the advice of my doctors. And record my remaining memories.<eos> But for you, not me.
They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies.<eos> - I am their friend.<eos> - Do they know that?<eos> They will.<eos> It's time they had their supper.<eos> I'm friends with your mother.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> Don't eat the help.<eos> When I was a child, an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.<eos> I begged him for one of you.
Does anybody have any idea why we're up here?<eos> You can't just leave, Neil, you have to address the issues of this deal.<eos> Look Gerald, I'm gonna call you Jerry.<eos> Jerry, from where I'm sitting you don't seem happy, you seem downright stressed. Stressed would be an understatement.<eos> Wouldn't you agree that we have a massive problem here?<eos> No, I mean I could see that you may have a problem.<eos> The closest thing i have to a problem is whether or not i can get to the roof before my chopper touches down.<eos> I don't like to keep the rotors running. This is insane, this is not the way it's done, this is not the way I do business. Who the fuck cares how you do business?<eos> This isn't a negotiation, it's a fire sale, a fire that you and your pals here fucking started. So give up whatever best case scenario you walked in here with, take a deep breath, swallow hard, and accept your new reality. This deal is not going through.<eos> Great, well let's close this baby before you guys run out of money.
What is it, are you guys not feeling this because everything's taken care of.<eos> Whatever you want. Guys, I even had dj z-trip make you all personal relaxation mixes. Really?<eos> Yeah, maybe that was a little overboard huh?<eos> So...<eos> It's just that... We all had a really great time last night. It was like the best night ever.<eos> We can only do it once, and yeah, we had our shot at it, and it was as advertised.<eos> Perfection. Come on, what's the issue?<eos> Why can't we do it twice?<eos> I wouldn't mind doing it again. Great!<eos> We're taking urge hitting everything in the agenda! Hold on, hey, wait, wait. Obviously it didn't work on me, so you guys go ahead, have fun, but I'm out.
It's perfect here.<eos> No more pretending, no more lies. We can be free.<eos> Why would you wanna leave paradise?<eos> Danny, we're your friends! Why are you doing this to us?<eos> ! Oh, wait, you're my friends, is that why you guys always treat me like a dickless clown? Why I'm always the butt of your fucking jokes?<eos> Danny, it's us, let us go! - This place-- - this place is magical! I am the Neo here!<eos> ! You don't know me.<eos> You guys know the old me. The scared me. The me who gave a fuck what you thought!<eos> Come on, Danny, let's stop it! I mean look around, look what's happening! People are dying!<eos> Your friends are dead! I can't tell you how happy I am to never be jealous of you again.
Just like your mother and father.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> What can I say?<eos> It has been fantastic to see you again.<eos> I am very blessed. Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice trip onwards.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you both and the children.
Well, we have to come back to get it. When?<eos> After the trial, or never.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's your cab?<eos> It's ours, the three of us all together.<eos> Then you should all get lawyers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The cab was used in the commission of a crime, which means the state can sue in order to keep it in a civil court. Sue?<eos> Sue who?<eos> You, the registered owners.

Sue?<eos> Sue who?<eos> You, the registered owners.<eos> But the suit won't get filed until the criminal trial and however many months that'll take, which I could have told you over the phone if you'd have called first.<eos> - Months? - Or longer.<eos> Slow wheels of justice and all.<eos> And I hate to say it, but you'll probably lose in civil court.<eos> Unless, uh... which of you is Khan?
- Is it your relative, sir?<eos> - Is it your relative who's been charged?<eos> - Yes. My son.<eos> Did he have permission from you to drive the cab? Not really.<eos> Well, then that's your out.<eos> You might have a chance with that if you don't mind filing charges, grand theft.<eos> File charges against my son?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to help you guys out.<eos> I'm no lawyer, but if he won't do it, it doesn't mean you guys can't give it a shot since you're co-owners.
Martinique, Nevis...<eos> Their magistrates hanged men for piracy.<eos> They all receive visits from me.<eos> The word went forth...<eos> Any capital sentence served against a pirate would hear my answer.<eos> You must'a known.<eos> You must'a heard.<eos> And yet you chose to hang those three men in your square.<eos> If I didn't...<eos> If I let my fear of you prevent me from enforcing the law, then civilization in this place is dead.

How?<eos> I offer the men exorbitant wages to do the work.<eos> "You can afford more. We want double that."<eos> All right, double it, it's a deal. Fuck it.<eos> You know what they say then? "You can't tell us what to do.<eos> We're free men."<eos> "We'll work when we please." Would you like to take a guess how that is going?<eos> It's five different crews, it's hundreds of men, untold thousands in wages, and I swear to God,<eos> I think that hole in the wall is bigger now than when we started.<eos> I stood between you and him, Jack.
Whoever that is out there, he has us.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> That man has a goddamned answer for everything. He's working on an answer for this.<eos> She's opening her gun ports!<eos> Gun crews, prepare to return fire!<eos> Gun crews at the ready!<eos> Cartridge.<eos> Gun crews ready!<eos> Crew of the Walrus!<eos> In my capacity as duly appointed servant of His Majesty King George the First, I address you directly. Hornigold.

Hornigold.<eos> Time is short, so I will be plain and offer you the same terms as accepted by the late Captain Hallendale's men.<eos> Surrender, and I am authorized to offer you full, unqualified pardons.<eos> Your ship will be commandeered and you will be given a choice of either entering into my service or being set free at the nearest convenient port, your names cleared and your accounts squared.
Make the guns ready.<eos> There'll be no battle today.<eos> Our disadvantage is too great.<eos> But what price surrender?<eos> To beg forgiveness from a thing that took my woman from me? My friend?<eos> Murdered her, displayed her body for their amusement.<eos> I can walk away from this fight if I just sign my name beneath a solemn oath never again to do violence against it.<eos> No.<eos> Not after all it has taken from me.<eos> Not after all it has taken from you.

Far too heavy for me.<eos> The boat sails at dawn.<eos> You need to decide now.<eos> A new life for you and Dom or...<eos> What should we do while we wait?<eos> To pass the time, what should we do?<eos> What should we talk about?<eos> You speak 19 languages.<eos> You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.<eos> You two, you spend a great deal of time together.
But here we are. Times change.<eos> When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners.<eos> Your father was a cunt.<eos> My beloved father, the Warden--<eos> Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.<eos> I might have done the same to my father if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.<eos> My father was poisoned by our enemies.<eos> Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?<eos> The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.<eos> We're farther north than any of you fuckers.
-It was wonderful.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> -We've never laughed so hard.<eos> -My ribs are still aching.<eos> You have an enormous comic talent, Mrs Foster Jenkins.<eos> It was so funny.<eos> Thank you very much...<eos> I must be on...<eos> Good afternoon to you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That's the cutest cat I've ever seen in my life.<eos> Hello!<eos> I'm sorry, Keanu?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I think it means "cool breeze" in Hawaiian.<eos> Honey, I'm sorry I can't come with you guys this weekend.
And so, yeah.<eos> I mean, the 17th Street Blips, they did tell me, you know, they gonna break in and "fuck my shit up."<eos> But... I mean, that's not, like, concrete proof.<eos> The 17th Street Blips.<eos> Okay, where are they?<eos> 17th Street.<eos> Be specific!<eos> Dude, look! I get you lost your kitty-cat, but y'all some dumb fucks if you think I'm gonna be a rat.<eos> I ain't some punk-ass bitch who's gonna be intimidated by y'all nerds!<eos> - You... - Nerds...
Uh... Kitty, kitty!<eos> Keanu!<eos> Thought y'all motherfuckers was dead.<eos> Didn't say goodbye or nothing.<eos> Oh, and my cat, New Jack?<eos> The one I would never give up to two niggas like y'all?<eos> He was gone, too.<eos> And now I see that you are, in fact, holding that nigga New Jack as we speak.<eos> Hi-C, get my cat.<eos> Hey, hey, you two!
When my dad left, my mom started drinking and she told me that my dad's leaving was all my fault.<eos> And I missed him a lot so, I'd cry.<eos> She got so fed up with the crying that she would lock me in the trunk of her car.<eos> Sometimes for hours.<eos> But there is this uh... a little hole in the trunk and one time a ladybug flew in.<eos> It kept me company.<eos> It made me feel safe.<eos> When I reached California, I'm going to color this tat.<eos> And that's the last time I will mark my body.<eos> If we get this money, I'm going away with you guys.
As long as you don't inconvenience our patients, I see no reason why you can't tag along.<eos> Do you know any gangsters?<eos> That's for us to know and for you to find out!<eos> Marvellous.<eos> - Swap them round.<eos> They're sending men into space, you'd think they'd have found a way round this by now.<eos> We'll have another try with the gas, with your next pain.<eos> SHE PANTS I feel a right chump, with my bum stuck in the air.<eos> Believe me, Rhoda, I've seen it all before.<eos> I was hoping for a nun, not one of you young 'uns.
How else are we going to manage it?<eos> Cos you ain't bringing nothing in.<eos> Ain't my fault the docks are slowing down.<eos> You got to try harder.<eos> You got to want less!<eos> I just... I just mean, things are tight.<eos> I ain't asking for a week in Paris.<eos> It's a pram.<eos> A new system -- help us get the most out of every day and ourselves.<eos> Each coloured pin represents you and your patient visits.
No need for nerves -- your wife can take all this in her stride.<eos> Isn't that right, Connie?<eos> I hope so, Sister.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Buenas noches a todos, and welcome, everyone.<eos> I'd like to welcome Phyllis.<eos> Miss Crane...<eos> Hola, Phyllis.<eos> Let's begin. The verb "ser".<eos> Vosotros, vosotras sois. Might I say what lovely accents you young people have.
Nurse Busby.<eos> This little thing that we've created is so entirely perfect.<eos> I know what my mother meant by not fully knowing love or fear until she had me.<eos> - Fred!<eos> - Oh! - I've spilt my water!<eos> - Coming, my love.<eos> Although strictly a volunteer helper, I'd hope to see my good work reflected in this week's pocket money.<eos> I'm sure you would!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> We know for some of you it took a great deal of effort.
Oh, it just needs a quick swill in some hot water.<eos> Shelagh... This holiday is about getting back to nature and being together as a family.<eos> We'll enjoy it, won't we?<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Because we've earned it.<eos> I love you. I love you, Michael.<eos> But you're going to kill me.<eos> We did the right thing putting you on iron tablets.<eos> Don't reckon you're anaemic - good going for nine months.<eos> I was anaemic with ALL of you.
- Patrick!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I'm just not sure about Godfrey.<eos> General practice is a young man's game.<eos> You're not supposed to be thinking about work.<eos> And if you don't mind my saying so, you're not exactly Cliff Richard yourself.<eos> I could sing a chorus of Summer Holiday if you'd like me to!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Mum? Dad?<eos> Can we come in with you?
With all the heartache and stigma that implies.<eos> I don't doubt that you've looked at this from every conceivable medical and social angle.<eos> However, whilst there is nothing in Anglican teaching to forbid birth control, the church does take a view on matters of morality.<eos> As Mrs Turner, at least, will be aware.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> Have a lemon puff.<eos> Is there anything plainer?<eos> I have some arrowroot biscuits. I'll pop and fetch them.<eos> Tea is on the table, Sister.<eos> I shan't join you today.
It meant that I was with friends.<eos> That I wasn't alone.<eos> I don't bother much with maraschino cherries any more,<eos> I don't even put them in my Horlicks, or my barley water -- they taste revolting.<eos> I don't need them.<eos> I know that fun doesn't come in bottles now.<eos> I know the value of sobriety... .. and I know what friendship really is, what it means.<eos> I always did, I just couldn't see it.<eos> I owe the 49 bus rather a lot, all things considered.<eos> And I owe you -- all of you -- even more.
And I owe you -- all of you -- even more.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like any method of contraception, you have to use it religiously, or it doesn't work.<eos> And there are some groups of women who'll find taking daily medication difficult.<eos> Which could be a catastrophe, if they are single.<eos> I'm extremely concerned that we do nothing to promote... recreational intercourse and I'm sure Mr Hereward feels the same.<eos> Well, what are the government guidelines?<eos> Mr Hereward, shouldn't you be more concerned with church teachings than government guidelines?<eos> Well, I do think we have to be mindful of the Bible.<eos> When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, he said, "There is too much immorality among you.
I don't want to be with "women like us", I just want to be with you.<eos> We can hold hands there.<eos> Dance there. Be in a crowd and be invisible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - There you go, pass that down.<eos> Well done.<eos> We'll rinse the lotion off your hair and just trim the ends before you change into some nice smart clothes.<eos> I don't want us to be late, they'll pick on us if we are.<eos> Miss Dawkins said you could come in at ten and go straight to Music and Movement.<eos> And no-one will pick on you, wearing those lovely fresh knickers and vests.
And what about this one?<eos> She looks old enough to come in handy.<eos> Take her with the other kids.<eos> Me and Nurse Mount can manage, can't we?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And I'll take my lead from you.<eos> Calm down, take a deep breath and tell me what you mean.<eos> She, she says she can see flashing lights!<eos> Go back to Gina and wait with her.<eos> I'm telephoning for an ambulance and then I'll come straight to you.
Well, then help me do my job and give me my guys.<eos> Here's what you guys are good at.<eos> Working out, eating five hot meals a day.<eos> What you're not so good at is doing what you're told.<eos> Uh, I need your trace report on yellowcake in five minutes.<eos> It's coming.<eos> That roadblock was run by Ansar Al-Sharia.<eos> It's not just tribal groups and freedom fighters anymore.<eos> If you have useful Intel, Tyrone, put it in a memo.<eos> You guys bunk here, but you're not CIA.
- Hello.<eos> And this is Jack, my husband.<eos> How are you?<eos> Very nice to meet you.<eos> This is my wife.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Oh. This is the best Italian restaurant.<eos> Come.<eos> Oh, fantastic.<eos> - Please, after you.
I know it's a problem.<eos> And here's the thing.<eos> The Ambassador isn't some dilettante political appointee.<eos> He's the real deal.<eos> A true believer.<eos> He's there to win hearts and minds.<eos> Now, he can't very well do that operating out of a classified facility that doesn't officially exist.<eos> If he's racking at the consulate with his State detail, then what fuck does this have to do with us?<eos> He's traveling with no staff, just a two-man security team.<eos> Now, the State guys don't know the city like you guys do.
So, we're looking at a low-profile event.<eos> We're here to back up State, so just stay in the background.<eos> Ambo's entering.<eos> Dave, take right side.<eos> Oh. What is this?<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> So much for a low profile.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> Who let them in?<eos> America is here for you.
to voice their discontent and anger about an American-made amateur film they say is insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.<eos> No?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Good talk.<eos> They say that although it's amateur, it is very much insulting toward the prophet Muhammad and that is their red line.<eos> What up?<eos> - Heard about Cairo? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Enlighten me, Boon.<eos> "All the gods, all the heavens,"<eos> "all the hells are within you."
We're getting DS out of here.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Go inside, please.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Get in the house right now! In the house!<eos> Fire sale!<eos> Everything must go.<eos> We got a large group of bad guys headed our way.<eos> We're gonna stay and look for the Ambo.<eos> You guys need to exfil.
You're trained to do this.<eos> It's your job.<eos> You can do it.<eos> We're all responsible for our lives, and what you do right now in this room will determine whether we live or die.<eos> Tripoli, we're here, getting on the oil executive's jet.<eos> GRS is back safe.<eos> Compound's lost. Still no sign of the Ambo.<eos> State's already blaming Al-Sharia.<eos> You're with Delta?<eos> What, just two of you?
- Here are your clothes.<eos> How are the Jason Bournes doing downstairs?<eos> Everyone's scared.<eos> I just got a text from my cousin, you know, a warning, saying to leave before it's too late.<eos> More good news.<eos> Anything more specific than that?<eos> I don't think we need an interpreter anymore, Amahl.<eos> You did good.<eos> You should go.<eos> No. I'm staying here with you guys.
I get it.<eos> Okay?<eos> You go to them.<eos> I know what it's like to be in a place like this, let another man raise your children.<eos> When I was young, I was giving myself to something bigger.<eos> Jack, that something bigger's gone now.<eos> But your new son?<eos> Kai is your second chance.<eos> I might actually not be a half-bad father.<eos> "All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells are within you."
I'm done.<eos> I'm coming home.<eos> For good.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm just lucky.<eos> I'm just lucky.<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Rone's not coming home.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> "All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells are within you."
That makes you traitor to the crown.<eos> Perhaps you have some concern for this English lady's honor. All right!<eos> I will tell you whatever you wish.<eos> Strike, and strike hard.<eos> Now we shall not return unless we bring victory back with us.<eos> Angus! The Jacobite army had moved steadily south during the months since Prestonpans.<eos> We had acquired much-needed artillery along the way, taken the English garrison at Carlisle, and successfully occupied Manchester.<eos> Despite this, the anticipated sympathetic uprising from the Scottish lowlands and northern England had so far not materialized.<eos> We were now encamped in northern England, awaiting further orders from Prince Charles.<eos> Your Royal Highness, I am aware how painful this must be for you, but the truth is often vexing.
Your Royal Highness, I am aware how painful this must be for you, but the truth is often vexing.<eos> We must turn back.<eos> And I say we shall not.<eos> Now, London lies within our grasp, and all we have to do is reach out and take it.<eos> John?<eos> This is no time for silence. Speak, man.<eos> I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.<eos> As you know, the Lord General and myself are seldom of like mind, but I fear, in this instance, we speak with one voice.<eos> I must say, this is a damned inconvenient time to be conciliatory.<eos> And I would say the same to you, My Lord General.
My guid freen Angus, he lost his front teeth when he was no' but a wee lad.<eos> A cow kicked 'em straight down his throat.<eos> Says he didna shite for a week for fear o' being bitten.<eos> Right, who's next?<eos> I came here.<eos> I sailed from France to raise an army, this army.<eos> It was God's will that I do so, and since then,<eos> His hand has ever been with us.<eos> This precious chance of victory, if we spurn His divine gift, there is no guarantee that it will be offered again.<eos> So is there no one among you still willing to stand by your prince, your rightful king, and your God?
I'm with you.<eos> Quick!<eos> Quickly!<eos> They went this way! Come on!<eos> Are you sure it's wise for us to stop?<eos> If not, Claire assures me Rupert will die.<eos> I haven't seen any redcoats for some time.<eos> Wait for my signal.<eos> Sorry, Laird.<eos> I didna ken it was you.
I'll get you a black eye patch.<eos> You'll be like a proper pirate.<eos> Pirates have eye patches?<eos> And peg legs and a parrot.<eos> What in the name of the wee man are you heaving about? Mm, oh, never mind.<eos> Jamie.<eos> Blow out the candle.<eos> What is it?<eos> What is that?<eos> You in the church!
Look, say I'm your hostage.<eos> They won't fire the place with me inside.<eos> Exchange me.<eos> Use me to bargain with them.<eos> It worked the last time.<eos> With a lad.<eos> These are soldiers.<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!
He's right.<eos> We will find each other.<eos> Trust in that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Behold the Jacobite army.<eos> That'll be enough, Lieutenant.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She's fainted from terror.<eos> I charge you personally with the lady's protection, sir.<eos> I urge you all, return to your homes!
It didn't take long to lose my sense of direction as we rode through the night.<eos> I knew I ought to be leaving some sort of sign for him to follow, but unfortunately, I was short of bread crumbs.<eos> We'll stop for the night in Crich, Mrs. Beauchamp.<eos> The horses have gone as far as they can.<eos> Right outside.<eos> Mugs of beer all around, and your lady too.<eos> Hey, we'll need food as well.<eos> - Here you go, ma'am.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dispatch has just arrived for you, sir.
Very well, then.<eos> Bellmont it is.<eos> Attention!<eos> Who did you say lives here?<eos> Do I have the honor of addressing the Duke of Sandringham?<eos> You do, indeed.<eos> But the honor is all mine, Lieutenant.<eos> I do so treasure any opportunity to aid one of the king's officers, especially in these difficult times.<eos> How may I be of assistance to you?<eos> This is for you, Your Grace, from my commander.
Oh, my, yes.<eos> They think they're being inconspicuous, but really, with those coats?<eos> They claim that they're resting and resupplying before they move on.<eos> In fact, I'm being watched.<eos> Every entrance of this house is being watched.<eos> I'm still suspected of being a Jacobite.<eos> I assume that your dashing husband must be intent on rescuing you even as we speak.<eos> It would be safe to assume so, yes.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Well, as I want to be rescued too, I'm coming with you.
Trying to play the British side by having his goddaughter marry a supporter of the king.<eos> I don't care why. I just can't do it. Calm down.<eos> I will speak to your godfather.<eos> But he just made a decision that means you might not have to marry a loyalist.<eos> Oh, would you?<eos> Thank you, Claire.<eos> Thank you so very much.<eos> Munro?<eos> Are you Munro?<eos> Good evening to you, sir.
You there!<eos> Are you Munro?<eos> Munro!<eos> I'm looking for...<eos> I've been sent by the Duke of Sandringham to give you a letter.<eos> It was written by a lady, Claire Beauchamp, for a James Fraser.<eos> Customarily, I'd be given a tip on delivery.<eos> Mrs. Beauchamp. Tired of Mary so soon?<eos> Not that I blame you.<eos> Actually, I wanted to speak with you about your plans for her marriage.
You seem perturbed in some way.<eos> How long has this man been in your employ?<eos> Well, I hired him in Paris.<eos> You're not thinking of stealing him away for your husband.<eos> Danton is very loyal to me.<eos> When did you hire him in Paris?<eos> What an odd q...<eos> She recognizes you!<eos> Your Grace, I promise you I took all precautions.<eos> You!
We go, huh?<eos> Aye.<eos> She's even misspelled "help."<eos> Hugh?<eos> - Mary!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Why are you locked in?<eos> I don't have time to explain everything now.<eos> I have to get out of here and get word to Jamie.<eos> Take me with you.
He can't be cured.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Bu... but he must be cured.<eos> Oh, God, Mary!<eos> Are you pregnant?<eos> Does Alex know?<eos> Yes.<eos> - And John.<eos> - Mary.<eos> Alex is asking for you.
Laudanum, no, no.<eos> Laudanum just dulls the senses.<eos> I would prefer something more final.<eos> Isn't suicide a sin?<eos> What's one more sin to a sinner?<eos> Geillis Duncan gave her husband a quick death.<eos> I would welcome the same.<eos> It may have been quick, but death by cyanide poisoning<eos> is an agonizing way to end one's life.<eos> I leave the details to you.
Alex will not listen to me.<eos> But you are sending your brother to his grave with a broken heart.<eos> If you love Alex, then I trust that that love is enough to stay your impulses with Mary.<eos> It grieves me to see you so ill, brother.<eos> Congratulations on yer ability to hide it so well.<eos> If so, it is because I also feel joy at yer change of heart.<eos> What change would that be?<eos> Joining the MacKenzies of Leoch with our righteous rebellion, restoring the king across the water to his throne.<eos> You think I've turned Jacobite?<eos> That I'm going to lead the MacKenzies over the cliff, with you lot?
That will be worth celebrating.<eos> It doesn't sound very gentlemanly.<eos> I think we've all learned there's nothing gentlemanly about waging war.<eos> It would mean a 12-mile march by night.<eos> And are the men capable of such strenuous endeavor?<eos> They've not let us down yet.<eos> Lord George will lead one column, I the other.<eos> Together we will trap the British between us.<eos> John?<eos> John, I look to you, as always.
All right. So let me get this straight.<eos> I give your cousin a contribution and it's like a get out of jail free card for me, right?<eos> That's something to celebrate.<eos> No, I don't do that.<eos> See, me... I celebrate when things are finished.<eos> Not when it's just starting.<eos> Listen to him.<eos> This is nothing to celebrate.<eos> You saw what happened to Fisk.<eos> You two shouldn't even be seen together... let alone having me all up in the Kool-Aid.
Then you just want my money for yourself, don't you?<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> I came here because Pop asked me to come for you.<eos> Pops?<eos> For your dad.<eos> Why does everybody bring him up?<eos> He was never there for me. I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.<eos> Pop thinks he has a way to clear this mess up.<eos> I know you didn't kill Dante... or Shameek.<eos> All you guys wanted was the cash.
I'm knocking all his pieces off the board.<eos> Where you goin' now?<eos> Check these fools.<eos> Three friends.<eos> Grade school tight.<eos> Playground tight.<eos> All-City in basketball in a town where that really matters.<eos> So what happens?<eos> Y'all don't go pro.<eos> One of you... starts working for Cottonmouth... makes some money, sees a slick opportunity, and you guys go for it.
Or like I call her, Godfather, Part Two.<eos> The sequel better than the original?<eos> Close.<eos> Look, I was defending' myself killing that dude.<eos> - But you went to his house.<eos> - It was- - Whatcha... whatcha call it?<eos> - Preventative.<eos> - Just more excuses.<eos> That's all I've heard for the last 20 minutes.<eos> I mean, do any of you ever say to yourself,
No one black has ever done anything like this.<eos> Percy Sutton came close, but that was years ago.<eos> Harlem's Paradise is special.<eos> And it's not going nowhere.<eos> If you don't make the right moves now... you are done.<eos> This place is my reputation.<eos> My blood.<eos> My legacy.<eos> He's here.<eos> You guys? Again?
Let's do it.<eos> Give it to me, baby.<eos> - That's it, that's it.<eos> - Man, take my money.<eos> The banker, baby, that's what they call me.<eos> - Double or nothing.<eos> - Bettin' six, betting' six.<eos> Damn.<eos> You guys actually take lunch breaks like real employees, huh?<eos> Any of you guys at Crispus Attucks the other night?
It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.<eos> He probably got a lead, and went to go and check it out.<eos> Alone.<eos> Without pulling you in on a single detail.<eos> Are you sure you don't know where to find him?<eos> If I knew, I would tell you.<eos> So is that how we're playing this, Captain?<eos> Like Scarfe is a suspect and not a victim?<eos> He could be both or either.<eos> We won't know until you guys bring him in. Us?
There he is!<eos> Stay on him!<eos> Kill the lights.<eos> There he is!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on, yo.<eos> Light his ass up!<eos> Shit!<eos> I'm gonna circle around.<eos> You three, through the hole. Go, go, go!
I know a place.<eos> Whatever we gotta do.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Manny?<eos> Who was that son of a bitch?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> But somebody took a shot at us.<eos> You guys got to get out of here.
'Cause seeing is my thing, right?<eos> That's what made me such a good point guard.<eos> 'Cause I could see everything in my head.<eos> I knew exactly where people were gonna be, so I put the ball right where it needed to go.<eos> But you couldn't see Scarfe for what he was.<eos> Or were you blinded by your emotions?<eos> You wouldn't say that if I was a man.<eos> - Oh, that is not true.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> Male cops can screw cop groupies in the back of their unmarked or their RMP, and you guys cheer.
Until last night... I was bulletproof.<eos> Jesus Christ, kid.<eos> What did this to you?<eos> They shot me with some crazy bullets.<eos> They exploded inside of him.<eos> He should be dead.<eos> My skin is now tough... like armor.<eos> I think maybe what makes him stronger is also pushing the shrapnel deeper into his organs.<eos> Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you.
Now that my cousin is gone, I'm making a few changes.<eos> I loved my cousin, but I didn't like what he did.<eos> Until he stopped serving you.<eos> Cut the crap, lady.<eos> What do you want to tell us?<eos> I'm out.<eos> My family is no longer to be associated with what you all do.<eos> I need to move in a more legitimate direction. Need?<eos> That's a weak hand you're playing.<eos> My cousin has valuable assets and connections. I'll give them to you... for a price.
The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.<eos> Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.<eos> There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.<eos> Sway in the Morning.<eos> What's on your mind, citizen?<eos> Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day.<eos> Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was.<eos> I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.<eos> I wouldn't put it past the government, man.<eos> Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right?
♪ And although it's only one We're sending George Washington ♪<eos> ♪ And he's gonna bring My baby home to me ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, America ♪<eos> ♪ The land of the free ♪<eos> That was amazing.<eos> Very special.<eos> It was just so moving.<eos> Thank you, and I'd also like to appeal to the generosity of the American public.<eos> Okay, please do.<eos> Um, if each of you just give a dollar for our heroes, our hostages.
- For the heroes.<eos> - Great idea.<eos> Eleanor needs your help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was great.<eos> Today is the eighth day that Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch have been held hostage in Ecuador.<eos> We shall not forget them.<eos> You can still make your donations to A Dollar For Our Heroes.<eos> Just to remind you, you can still make your donations to A Dollar For Our Heroes.<eos> And we at Q365 News want to thank you all for your emails of concern.
Yeah. Okay.<eos> You're gonna call your wife, okay? - Okay.<eos> - Call her.<eos> - She's never gonna believe him. - Shh.<eos> Let's keep it positive.<eos> - What do you say to him?<eos> - Call your wife.<eos> - Good.<eos> - How much money do you want?<eos> - 100,000 for each of you.
Suck my balls.<eos> I've got terrible gut rot.<eos> Motorhead, "Ace of Spades."<eos> That's what I call myself on Rebel Coup.<eos> - "Ace of Spades." That's a good omen.<eos> - Great omen.<eos> So, you have no one that loves you that is willing to pay money to get you back.<eos> Completely useless to us.<eos> Worthless.<eos> We might as well get some entertainment out of you.
- I need to...<eos> - Come on, get up.<eos> What do you mean fight to the death?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> - That's right. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You're gonna shoot me?<eos> The other ones are going to hear the shots, they're gonna come in here: pop, pop, pop.<eos> - Shoot you to bits. - I don't care.<eos> We're gonna die anyway.<eos> Only one of you will die, you see?
- Do your job.<eos> Or I will kill your daughter in front of you.<eos> And then I'll kill you.<eos> [dramaticexoticmusic]<eos> ¶¶<eos> -Hello,Sunstoneresidents.<eos> Timetodigdeep andfindthathappyplace.<eos> Youarestronger thanyouthink, andworthierthanyou believe.<eos> Visualizetheplacewhere youarethemostatpeace , yourhappyplace, abeautifulplace.<eos> Today,nobodyis in charge ofyourhappinessbut you .
She's prepping for Armageddon.<eos> The earth is going to burn.<eos> That job I took the last time I saw you?<eos> It was to keep a girl hidden from Renautas. Her name is Malina.<eos> She and her brother are Evos who can stop the HELE.<eos> - Then we need to find these two. Now how do we start?<eos> - There's someone here who can help our cause.<eos> Micah Sanders.<eos> - All right, let's split up then.<eos> You guys deal with Parkman. We'll grab my nephew,
Findyourcenter andsettlethere.<eos> - It's got to be one of these, right?<eos> - Your guess is as good as mine.<eos> -Serenityis ourgoal. - Not anymore.<eos> -Cooperationis our--<eos> [tensemusic]<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Evening the odds.<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Helps me keep up with you Evo types.
- Yeah, she did.<eos> But it was all in Japanese.<eos> How about we go back to the present, and you show me how I'm gonna send everyone here before the HELE kills us all?<eos> - Take us back to Gateway, Odessa, Texas.<eos> Otomo, then us.<eos> You'll save everyone there first.<eos> - Odessa?<eos> - We're not here to hurt you.<eos> We shut off the director's voice.<eos> He has no more power over you. You're free.
Hello!<eos> Got to go back, save my sister, save the world.<eos> Where am I?<eos> We are ready to link into the processor.<eos> Start the presentation.<eos> By now, you all know the dire circumstances our planet faces.<eos> The first of two very powerful solar flares is set to arrive momentarily.<eos> For those who fear this is the end, I assure you it is anything but.<eos> In fact, for those of us here in Gateway, this is just the beginning.<eos> Each and every one of you has been handpicked.

The first generation of what will become a new and improved world.
Can't keep me here forever. I have rights.<eos> Here's the thing, Quentin.<eos> We know you were there.<eos> You saw how it went down.<eos> These Evos save the whole world and don't ask for a thing in return.<eos> No one does that.<eos> So the question is, who are they?<eos> You want to know who they are?<eos> They're somebody's sister, somebody's brother, daughter, son, grandchild.<eos> See, you people-- you people want them to be extraordinary.

And now they just want to be left alone...<eos> So they can scratch out some small purpose that can give their life some meaning, community, hope, like all the rest of us.<eos> And when that darkness rolls in-- and it will-- they'll be here, ready for the call, up for the task, without us even having to ask.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, this is just the beginning, man-- an awakening.<eos> And now my eyes are open- wide open.<eos> They were here to save us.<eos> So you want to know who they are?<eos> Look in the mirror.<eos> They're you, they're me, on our best day.
I am Jan Kubiš.<eos> I am Josef Gabčík. From Slovakia.<eos> You must not be surprised by our lack of trust.<eos> The Gestapo have been very successful in infiltrating our network.<eos> Oldrich Novák. He was taken away several months ago.<eos> Why wasn't London informed?<eos> We lost Contact with the Czech government in exile in London some months ago.<eos> We need replacement crystals for the transmitter.<eos> We've been waiting for them to send someone to re-establish contact.<eos> Is that you?
Welcome.<eos> Mrs. Kovárníková's daughter.<eos> I pay her for helping out.<eos> Dinner will be at 6:00.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Ata, dinner is ready.<eos> And finally the fiddler is silent.<eos> He is a violinist, Alois.<eos> A violinist.<eos> You two boys looking for work, then?
Josef.<eos> - Jan.<eos> - Opálka.<eos> Valčík.<eos> I see you are no strangers to one another, but we don't have much time.<eos> We all trained special operations together.<eos> Valčík here was even on the same drop.<eos> Yes, dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course.<eos> Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A, we have finally re-established communications with London.<eos> I have orders to send and receive any communications between you and London.
I know you've had me followed.<eos> I understand you don't trust me, but, if I was an informer for the Gestapo, do you think you would still be here? Do you?<eos> Then you tell me, Ladislav.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> I fear Czechoslovakia will be wiped from the map.<eos> You ask me if I'm afraid?<eos> Yes, I'm afraid.<eos> Jan, Uncle, we do it tomorrow.<eos> As planned.<eos> May God be with you.
It's hard times for small farmers like you and myself. Breakin' even's hard enough, but getting ahead's impossible.<eos> So to save some, I cut them back to a meal a day per head now. A few of them started getting' fidgety, so I had abner come down on 'em.<eos> Abner, here, he's my only real protection.<eos> Now, they needs to mind me. You speak on that.<eos> They treasure in heaven from submitting' and all.<eos> If they gets to moanin' or carrying' on, you don't pay 'em no mind, because they lazy as all hell. They do anything to get outta work.<eos> You ready, boy?<eos> Listen up!<eos> Got a preacher here tonight.<eos> Come here, boy. Now, he's a nigger here like y'all, and he's here to talk to you about the lord.
Got some fine Brandy and a couple of choice wenches in the cellar. Get abner here to strike out the fiddle and sit around the fire, tell some old lies?<eos> We best be gettin' back before sun go down.<eos> All right. Suit yourself.<eos> Would take a bottle of that Brandy, if you could spare it.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> I got a chocolate one here that does it right every time. You sure you don't wanna stay?<eos> No, they expecting' us back. You know how it is. All right.<eos> You's a smart man, Sam.<eos> Man make a fortune with that boy.<eos> Great doin' business with you.
It appears Director Dewey is held up momentarily, and I am being told that it shouldn't be too much longer.<eos> But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight,<eos> - so we can start anyway...<eos> - Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Can I get the ball rolling?<eos> Oh, sure, man, by all means.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.<eos> Thank you. Thanks a lot.<eos> Thanks a lot to Brad and all the folks at EXOCON for having us back, and to you guys for turning out.

How the hell did he get through immigration?<eos> Someone issued him an Agency security clearance on his passport.<eos> Well, it turned out to be a pretty popular idea.<eos> People from around the world started using our service.<eos> Well, first off, this has all made me a lot more rich than is probably healthy.<eos> When I come on stage, take care of Kalloor and the girl.<eos> Copy.<eos> But, what I mean to say is that, you know, all this success has come at a cost.<eos> There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.<eos> A guilty secret, and, um... I have to share it with all of you guys.
Girls rule. Women are funny.<eos> Bebe, get over yourself, seriously.<eos> Get the mic out of my face!<eos> Oh, my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird.<eos> Um... Let's see. Red, you got any zingers for the crowd?<eos> No?<eos> How about you, Nelly?<eos> Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck.<eos> 'Kay, that wasn't really funny.<eos> It was just angry. You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys.

Now, just try and say it a little bit funnier now.<eos> Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us.<eos> Then see if you guys think it's funny.
She was a quick study.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> As king, I welcome you to the Order of the Chosen.<eos> At the dawn of every new year, we gather in this sacred garden to recount the story of the Ellcrys.<eos> Thousands of years ago... our Elven ancestors fought a war against an army of Demons.<eos> The Elves were at the point of annihilation, when their elders turned to magic.<eos> Using this powerful gift, they managed to imprison the Demons in a realm known as the Forbidding.<eos> The Ellcrys was created to stand sentry.<eos> As long as it lives, the Demons are locked up for all eternity.<eos> Now, I realize that for some of you, this is merely... folklore.
Garbage in the yard.<eos> Get off your ass and fix it.<eos> Clean it up.<eos> When we first moved here... this neighborhood had some pride.<eos> What's the matter with people?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The Griffins represent everything that's gone wrong with this world.<eos> It's immoral, is what it is.<eos> Your generation's gonna have to make it right again.<eos> It's up to you.
The Griffins represent everything that's gone wrong with this world.<eos> It's immoral, is what it is.<eos> Your generation's gonna have to make it right again.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You know?<eos> I'm sorry my generation screwed it up so bad.<eos> It's all right.<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, our parents built a great country... and we couldn't even maintain it for you.
What the shit is this?<eos> You need oranges, Jackson?<eos> This market is mine.<eos> No trading goes on without me getting my beak wet.<eos> You should report me to the Red Hats.<eos> Your backpack.<eos> Your backpack, shit-heel.<eos> Your beak's wet.<eos> - Five-oh. - Let's go.<eos> Hey, you over there.
Oh, Teddy.<eos> Any special tricks for us?<eos> They teach you to sit up, beg?<eos> How about I give you the first shot, hmm?<eos> After all, every dog has his day.<eos> Well, your mouth move fast enough.<eos> How about your gun?<eos> What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?<eos> And that they can do anything they want to you?<eos> I never understood why they paired some of you off.
Yeah, the half that's gonna cut your fucking throat.<eos> I told you, I didn't take...<eos> Good as new again, huh?<eos> Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.<eos> We've got a serious problem with one of the hosts.<eos> Thinking this one's still thirsty.<eos> Not gonna die this time, Arnold.<eos> Ain't nothing gonna kill me.<eos> You can't have none.<eos> Ain't for you.
I think we best stay put.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> With considerable effort and lack of sleep, I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector to head to town a week early.<eos> Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives after robbing the saloon.<eos> It's chilling.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I can barely contain myself.<eos> That's the sheriff's horse, you son of a bitch.<eos> His rifle, too.<eos> All the banks and trains around here, and you fucking reprobates choose to rob us?
This behavior, we're miles beyond a glitch here.<eos> Access your current build, please.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Rose is a rose... is a rose.<eos> What is your itinerary?<eos> To meet my maker.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> And what do you want to say to your maker?<eos> By most mechanical and dirty hand...<eos> I shall have such revenges on you both.
- You don't know that for certain, Geordie.<eos> - It's a fiction.<eos> Like God, the angels and the multitude of the heavenly... whatsits.<eos> Hosts.<eos> Heavenly hosts.<eos> I'll be polishing the brasses.<eos> God help those poor brasses.<eos> I'm sorry if we upset you.<eos> All those men looking at those pictures of her.<eos> All you men talking about her like she's a puzzle to be solved.
We'll find her.<eos> And how many times would you say that you've had this experience, Jane?<eos> About ten or twelve since I was young.<eos> And when you have this ... these experiences, do you feel paralyzed?<eos> Yeah, it's like I'm pinned to the bed. I can't move.<eos> It's terrifying.<eos> What you might be suffering from what's know as sleep paralysis.<eos> So you saying that ... is adopted?<eos> No, I'm simply trying to reason what Jane may have experienced.<eos> You bloody scientists think you know everything.
You don't want to see her like this.<eos> You really don't.<eos> Can you think of anyone, anyone that may have wished Chloe harm?<eos> No.<eos> Did she mention anything?<eos> Think back.<eos> Words she may have had with someone?<eos> She had a big mouth, like me, but no one hated her.<eos> You know what she was like.<eos> How about you two?
It seems that she took a blow to the head.<eos> - We're not sure of the weapon yet.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Someone murdered her?<eos> We'll begin a thorough investigation, starting with everyone at the party, including everyone in Grayson's ute.<eos> Grayson?<eos> We have to talk to everybody, Max.<eos> Who have you got on your list?<eos> We can't disclose that information, sorry.<eos> If we can ask you to please keep this to yourselves.
And why would you bother lying about a bloody cardigan?<eos> Look, here comes the first lot.<eos> - They'll circle for a bit, they'll find the direction then head home.<eos> He's now convinced the murder took place in Mother Sullivan's.<eos> Can't work out whether he's trying to solve it or cover it up.<eos> Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Just a question.<eos> I'm not pointing the finger at anyone, and this conversation never happened, right?<eos> But do any of you blokes know anything about
I just rang the organizers.<eos> There is no concert.<eos> I'll call it in.<eos> Deb, is there somewhere we can talk?<eos> Nobody knows what it's like to lose a child<eos> The desperate helplessness. The aching loss.<eos> People look at you like you're contagious. With some horrible disease they don't want to catch.<eos> But they don't really care.<eos> Now you'll know what it feels like.<eos> Chloe had to pay the price for you all.
No, it's a great idea, but we need a little money to make it real.<eos> I'm just talking a ballroom, a band, some chicken, maybe a shave-ice station.<eos> - What the hell is a "shave ice"?<eos> - It's like a snow cone, but the way they get the ice is different.<eos> - How different?<eos> - It's more snow than ice.<eos> I'm not getting a mental picture.<eos> Hoffman, Tanner!<eos> Get the hell in here!<eos> What do you guys know about shave ice?
- That was private.<eos> We'll sneak in backstage, and we'll pretend we're the opening act.<eos> Was. I was a ventriloquist. There's a big difference.<eos> What? You're a ventriloquist?<eos> - Well, she's a girl!<eos> - Oh, you are a dead man! - You are!<eos> You pee sitting down!<eos> Hey! - You want to go?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - I will take you down right now!
Going all the way up to the front, if you want to follow me.<eos> All the way up here, file in please.<eos> Here is the museum's most valuable piece,<eos> "Thumb", painted by Carpaccio MacGuffin the Scottish Italian master, this painting is the last work he ever did before he went into seclusion.<eos> It is worth well over $10 million.<eos> Look in front of you, see these velvet ropes, they prevent anyone from getting close to the painting.
- Fine.<eos> If Dr. Zaius hasn't given us enough information to make him a prime suspect, maybe his brother, Randy, can chime in.<eos> Are you in or out?<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Randy Zaius?<eos> L.A.P.D.<eos> Do you remember us from this afternoon?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I remember you guys.
Oh, you mean this ferret?<eos> How did you...<eos> I'm pausing so you can tell us. It was simple.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> Nice work, Scholls.<eos> It's okay, sweetie, you're safe now. Ow!<eos> You son of a... It's not worth it!<eos> It's not worth it! It's not worth it!<eos> Dr. Edelweiss will be able to tell us where this ferret came from.<eos> Computer: What can I do for you, Detectives Tribeca and Julie?
Thank you.<eos> So, if there's nothing else, I have a very busy day protecting animals.<eos> Guten tag.<eos> We got to get into this tournament.<eos> - Where are we gonna get $50,000?<eos> - We'll figure it out.<eos> Let's just hope that Laurie partridge doesn't get in our way. Aah!<eos> Once again, Tribeca, you see that there's nothing you can possess that the Fish and Game cannot take away.<eos> No, not Ferret Fawcett.<eos> And as for your decoy, the joke's on you because they were delicious.
I don't know... maybe it's that kids constantly remind me that I'm never gonna meet anyone.<eos> Tribeca.<eos> Yeah. Great.<eos> Geils, let's go.<eos> Scholls came up with something.<eos> Right behind ya.<eos> [English accent] One lump or two, Mr. Muggles?<eos> Cheers.<eos> What do you got, Scholls?<eos> I got a real bombshell for you guys.
I mean, no.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think Hale was sleeping with your wife so you hired a woman to kill him.<eos> You can't pin that on me!<eos> Now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I have a tee time.<eos> Mr. Stephens, you're under arrest for the murder of Riley Hale.<eos> There he is!<eos> Police business!<eos> Stephens, hold it right there!<eos> There is a foursome ahead of you.
What the hell are nodes?<eos> You wanted to see us, sir?<eos> Yeah, don't mind the butcher here.<eos> I'm just having my insurance physical.<eos> Afraid we got a killing spree on our hands.<eos> The word "spree" makes it sound fun, but it isn't.<eos> There's been a murder on the last three Thursday night evening flights from New York to L.A., all in first class.<eos> Sounds like someone has it out for rich people.<eos> When are rich people gonna get a break?<eos> You two, head over to L.A.X., figure out what the hell is going on.
So this is a dead end.<eos> Why don't we get back to the precinct and see if forensics had better luck?<eos> Thank you for your time, sir.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> As a matter of fact, we did.<eos> Dr. Edelweiss?<eos> Ah, detectives.<eos> I'll be right with you.
There were only two chickens on that flight, and they both have alibis.<eos> However, these feathers match exactly the ones found in an airplane pillow.<eos> The cause of death was asphyxiation, or smothering in layman's terms.<eos> What does "layman's terms" mean?<eos> So, who's the killer?<eos> Well, perhaps if we test one of these feathers in the gas chromatograph, it may point us to something the killer was exposed to.<eos> Traces of, um, salbutamol.<eos> And traces of ipratropium bromide... Chemicals commonly found in standard inhalers.<eos> Your killer's an asthmatic.<eos> The two of you on a plane cut off from backup?
Also, I'm really worried about Vivian on that plane all by herself.<eos> She's a flight attendant.<eos> What's your problem with Vivian?<eos> I'm just so sick of her helpless routine.<eos> You know what I like about your cousin, Angie?<eos> She's not afraid of admitting she needs somebody.<eos> Also, amazing breasts.<eos> I felt like that had to be said.<eos> If you kids are finished, we have a murderer to catch.<eos> You, me, Tanner, and Geils are going undercover on that flight, that is, if you two think you can work together.
If we could infiltrate the gang...<eos> We all understand what can happen once you infiltrate a gang.<eos> We don't need a long explanation!<eos> - We're going undercover.<eos> - Even deeper.<eos> We're going undercover.<eos> Deeper than that.<eos> We're going undercover.<eos> That's right... deep cover.<eos> For your own safety, the department will disavow any knowledge of you or this assignment.
The night you brought Alison to me, the life inside her desperately clawing to get out.<eos> Losing my daughter changed me, but but I'm doing what I have to to make it right.<eos> You'll understand soon enough.<eos> Just please, can you please tell me where Alison is?<eos> Just...<eos> You tell me, goddammit.<eos> You tell me where she is.<eos> Don't worry, Daniel.<eos> I'm gonna help her.<eos> I'm gonna help all of you.
Down here.<eos> Looks like this place is gonna collapse.<eos> Can you hear me okay?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> The stairwell to the basement is at the back of the building.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Got it.<eos> Look. Someone's been here.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> The door to the morgue should be right there in front of you.
Thank you, devil.<eos> I thought you gave up the ghost.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> That bullet shattered.<eos> Shrapnel all through your thigh.<eos> Extracted a few fragments, but there's still some deep inside.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I want it out.<eos> All of it.<eos> It's part of you now.
He hand down a judgment?<eos> He did.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Private, what... what is that... what is that you're playing?<eos> It got no name, far as I know.<eos> Just a melody I keep hearing in my head.<eos> It is not "just a melody"<eos> rattling around in your head, you.<eos> It is, unless I misheard, Two Soldiers, and you... you almost have it,
Excuse me.<eos> Private, what... what is that... what is that you're playing?<eos> It got no name, far as I know.<eos> Just a melody I keep hearing in my head.<eos> It is not "just a melody"<eos> rattling around in your head, you.<eos> It is, unless I misheard, Two Soldiers, and you... you almost have it,<eos> but for blowing a note or two, you should be drawing.<eos> A more intimate instrument does not exist.<eos> You... you give to it the most cherished gift a man has...
Should've seen it'd be hard on you, but it's been so long...<eos> She's my wife.<eos> William's my son.<eos> Sickness and health is what it means to be a husband.<eos> We swore an oath.<eos> You left her to smallpox.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Naomi and I share a faith, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> You see, we also swore an oath.<eos> After you were long gone.
- On what?<eos> - There's a certain dissatisfaction sets in when we get what we think we want.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Ennui.<eos> I guess that's it.<eos> - How long have they been there?<eos> - Since this morning.<eos> This came in on the train.<eos> Something about Cheyenne being the new railroad hub?<eos> I am sorry, Mr. Nobles, but there is nothing I can do for any of you.
- That lumber deal is financing a steel mill in Chicago, which is supporting a cotton operation in Virginia, which is supporting a coal mine in Kentucky...<eos> Jesus. You're broke.<eos> I am between transactions.<eos> This house was built long before you came in, Maggie.<eos> You knew what you were getting when you waltzed through the door.<eos> What I know is those ranchers are dangerous when they are cornered.<eos> We need to find a way to pay them or we will be hip deep in blood. And ain't no scheme in the world gonna save us.<eos> Go away.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> It's not often someone like you frequents our establishment.

No one dies.<eos> But you can puck Mr. Durant, all right?<eos> Now, that's a job I can get behind.<eos> Good man.<eos> He's it, not me.<eos> Ms. Strobridge.<eos> Take your brood inside for a moment.<eos> Anything you gotta say to me, you can say to us.<eos> Well, I think it'd be better if we spoke in private.<eos> Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?
He's it, not me.<eos> Ms. Strobridge.<eos> Take your brood inside for a moment.<eos> Anything you gotta say to me, you can say to us.<eos> Well, I think it'd be better if we spoke in private.<eos> Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?<eos> Say your piece.<eos> Very well, Mr. Strobridge, the Central Pacific no longer requires your services as railroad superintendent.<eos> You have until tomorrow to pack your things.<eos> The railroad will provide transit for you and your family wherever you want to go.
- Hanna.<eos> I suspect you need it ready for my replacement.<eos> It's your choice, Jim.<eos> I was your only friend.<eos> Never mind about the train tickets.<eos> We can make our own way.<eos> Very well.<eos> The Central Pacific thanks you for your service, sir.<eos> Tell me, Mr. Huntington.<eos> What lies beyond the railroad for you?
A white assassin came to town and killed my foreman a few months back, shot him point blank in Chinatown.<eos> Maybe it was the same guy.<eos> Y'all fight wars to keep your whores, right?<eos> Perhaps Chang's death was due to a dispute over the value of this woman.<eos> Please inform the General the Central Pacific hopes that Mr. Chang's death doesn't need to interrupt a long business relationship between our companies.<eos> You wouldn't jeopardize your entire business for one man, would you?<eos> The General says the Sze Yup's services will continue without interruption.<eos> He will send one of his best company men, Ling Lee.<eos> He speak English?<eos> You'll find him of equal use and value to you as Mr. Chang.
They did it.<eos> How are you feeling right about now?<eos> For the record, of course.<eos> Like it's over.<eos> Does that make you happy or sad?<eos> The cost was high.<eos> Well...<eos> You did the impossible, the unimaginable. Is any cost really too high?<eos> Them's is questions for presidents and poets to answer.<eos> History will not forget you, Mr. Bohannon. Or what you did.
I don't want the money.<eos> Three-quarters of a million dollar.<eos> Enjoy the festivities.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake, take it!<eos> Take Ogden.<eos> If that will end this, Thomas, by all means, take it.<eos> But the ceremony happens at Promontory, on C.P. soil.<eos> And I keep all the government bonds.<eos> All two and a half million dollars' worth.<eos> It's a pleasure doing business with you, Collis.
But I'm not selling.<eos> I've been indicted.<eos> News will hit the papers tomorrow.<eos> I want no record of your involvement in the Union Pacific.<eos> I helped build the Union Pacific.<eos> You're associated with the Dead Rabbits.<eos> I'm compelled to cut ties.<eos> Your stock value by tomorrow will plummet.<eos> Stick around, then you'll be broke or in jail or both.<eos> I've buried bodies for you.
A best-selling authoress can write her own ticket.<eos> Slow down, Mr. Bohannon, pack light.<eos> I need you back in San Francisco as soon as you're finished with this Washington business.<eos> That well's deeper than you think.<eos> Careful you don't fall in.<eos> - They're interested in Durant, not me.<eos> - No, they're a hound with a scent.<eos> Once they've chewed through Durant, they'll come sniffing after us.<eos> I'm ahead of that problem.<eos> It was you, lit that little bonfire in the CP depot last night?

Railroad man, through and through!<eos> All aboard!<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. Bohannon?<eos> Archibald Romans, Senior White House Staff.<eos> I'm here to invite you to President Grant's gala this evening.<eos> I ain't much for galas.<eos> In celebration of the completion of the railroad.<eos> I come to testify, Mr. Romans, not socialize.<eos> The President has asked for you personally, Mr. Bohannon.
The man of the hour.<eos> Quite an accomplishment, this railroad of yours.<eos> Thank you ma'am.<eos> You're more handsome than I ever imagined.<eos> You must tell me everything about the Wild West.<eos> They say it isn't safe for a respectable woman.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm not in the right place.<eos> Margaret, your husband is asking for you.<eos> George, he's a bore.<eos> And he's hopeless without you, my dear.
Colonel George Armstrong Custer.<eos> Damn impressed with your accomplishment on the railroad, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> Ten miles in a single day, was it?<eos> Well, had me one hell of a crew.<eos> You've the guts and countenance of a good soldier, sir.<eos> Who did you serve?<eos> I rode under General Nathan Bedford Forrest.<eos> Confederate.<eos> That's right.<eos> Shit, I led the charge against you boys at Bull Run.
Your job would be to protect the railroad you've built from all present threats.<eos> - You mean Indians.<eos> - All threats, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> Cutthroats and train robbers. Cattle rustlers along the Texas border. And, yes, renegade Indians.<eos> I ain't no Indian killer.<eos> You're smart enough to prevent bloodshed where possible, and... not afraid to get your hands dirty when necessary.<eos> You'd report to the Secretary of the Interior.<eos> Sounds like you're asking me to wear Union Blue.<eos> I'm asking you to wear an American uniform.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Bohannon. Don't deny who you are.
How would you describe it?<eos> _ They...<eos> Everyone had marks but...<eos> The point is to let Mrs. Toole tell her story in her own words.<eos> Go ahead, Eva.<eos> We won't interrupt.<eos> It was hard at first because I missed my momma.<eos> But then I had me a Mojave... Had me a Mojave sister and...<eos> I'm sorry, this dress just don't seem to fit right.<eos> But the dress is part of the story, it indicates you...
How long has it been since your last confession?<eos> Are you a soldier?<eos> It's all right, my son.<eos> No man is without sin, but you can be forgiven.<eos> Do you seek salvation?<eos> Do you wish to be saved?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thomas Durant will invoke his fifth amendment right as secured by the constitution of the United States.<eos> Mr. Durant, we have sworn testimony corroborating the charges against you.
Dreams don't come pretty, they don't come clean and they sure as hell don't come simple...<eos> They come true.<eos> Truth delivered by lies is no less true,<eos> and dreams made reality by falsehood are no less real.<eos> 1,776 miles of iron track, that is what I delivered!<eos> Track upon which thousands of wheels will now revolve carrying on their axles the wealth of half the world.<eos> Final destination, San Francisco!<eos> Drawn by the iron horse, darkening the landscape with his smoky breath, announcing to the world with its piercing scream that we are a great people who can accomplish great things.<eos> Yet the American people, driven by their cowardly representatives in Washington, are in need of a villain.<eos> So here I sit, elected by you, to play my Pam-
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> According to Nina, there are two sets of tunnels, yeah... each leading to exits in other buildings.<eos> The southernmost tunnel is the one that collapsed.<eos> Why don't you guys go together?<eos> I'll take the southern tunnel.<eos> - Wait, Frankie...<eos> - Janie, I got it.<eos> - Be careful, detective.<eos> - You, too.
You're in a tough spot, Nicky.<eos> We can prove that you shot and killed Egon Kronis.<eos> No, but you don't understand.<eos> We understand that you're involved with the Quint Street Boys.<eos> We have your blood at the scene, and we have security video of you running away with a gun.<eos> That's enough to put you away for life.<eos> Unless... you'd like to talk about the gang.<eos> We know they wanted you dead. We know they sent a hit man to do it.<eos> - What we don't know is why.<eos> - Well, how can I trust you?
We can only clear three inches at a time.<eos> You know what?<eos> Go back to the bullhorn.<eos> 'Cause what you're saying is excruciating.<eos> Hey, you know, I'm in a nice, shady spot, so get everybody else out first, huh?<eos> Wha...<eos> I'm kidding. I'm kidding.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He's right.<eos> You're all clustered together.
Our bomb squad just found another mine.<eos> - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - In the same place.<eos> Whoever did this was determined to take him out.<eos> I'm an expert in de-mining.<eos> I-I appreciate the offer, but what would really help is to figure out who killed him.<eos> Can you put together a list of the places you've worked, uh, copies of his e-mails, employee records?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Anyone with a grudge against you is a potential suspect now, all right?
What?<eos> Oh, look.<eos> The marriage coach.<eos> Here to help us with our cold feet.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Whose blood is this?<eos> Emily, what have you done?<eos> What I'll do to you.<eos> What I'll do to all of you.
You had a minute-long conversation at 1:00 in the morning.<eos> Ten minutes later, she's dead, and you're in her house. Can you explain that to me?<eos> Listen, I...<eos> EMILY:<eos> What was that?<eos> Help me.<eos> Wait. Put your hands up.<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> - Just sit down.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. I wouldn't go up there if I were you.
Deliver us from evil!<eos> I love you, Emily.<eos> Deliver us from evil.<eos> I love you, Emily.<eos> I love you, Emily!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Put your hands behind your head right now!<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you.
- Franchise!<eos> Franchise the damn thing!<eos> It's too damn good for just one location.<eos> There should be McDonald's everywhere.<eos> Coast to coast. Sea to shining sea.<eos> - Mr. Kroc...<eos> - Hey, you know I...<eos> I got a confession I want to make to you boys.<eos> I'm not out here in California for any kind of business meetings.<eos> I came out here for you.
Vacuums, plumping, piano lessons.<eos> You're a jack of all trades.<eos> Yeah, whatever puts food on the table, right?<eos> You must be so proud?<eos> How would you like to do more than "put a little food on the table"?<eos> Bingo!<eos> She's excited.<eos> What'd you have in mind?<eos> I'm going to give you three words.<eos> I want you to take those three words home with you tonight.
Aren't we? We've got mouths to feed.<eos> That's a family.<eos> I'm looking for a few good men.<eos> And women! Who aren't afraid of hard work. Aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves.<eos> Cliché, I know, but I'm looking for scrappers, hustlers.<eos> Guys who are willing to roll up their sleeves.<eos> People with drive.<eos> They got a little fire in the belly.<eos> Got a little chutzpah!<eos> I stand right here before you today and I'm going to offer you something as precious as gold.
Greed has nothing to do with it.<eos> If I had more money to work with,<eos> I could be growing this thing at twice the pace.<eos> We have no beef with the current rate of expansion.<eos> I've got nothing, not one location in Pennsylvania.<eos> - Nothing in New York.<eos> - All in good time.<eos> - Nothing in Texas.<eos> - I have no doubt it will come.<eos> I'm out here breaking my neck for you guys.
I'm very aware of who Buddy Jepsen is.<eos> He told me he received a shipment this morning.<eos> Oh, it arrived.<eos> You are way out of line, Ray.<eos> Gee, I didn't expect that to get there until Friday at the earliest.<eos> Do you mind telling me what you're doing shipping four cases of Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?<eos> Look, if you don't want to make a profit, that's fine.<eos> But don't stop the rest of us. - Us?<eos> - Us.<eos> As in everyone but you.

You have no right, you are to stop this instant.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Nah.<eos> What the hell does that mean! Nah!<eos> You will abide by the terms of your deal!<eos> I am through taking marching orders from you.<eos> You and your endless parade of nos.<eos> Constantly cowering in the face of progress.<eos> If phony powdered milkshakes is your idea of progress, you have a profound misunderstanding of what McDonald's is about!<eos> I have a far greater understanding of McDonald's than you two yokels.
This-this was just for us, it doesn't mean anything.<eos> It doesn't mean anything. Bob is right.<eos> Just to give us, um, something to talk about.<eos> - And it's not admissible. - I mean, every time... What did they think was gonna happen?<eos> You ask me that.<eos> Somebody say something!<eos> What did they think was gonna happen?<eos> They're talking about the mother of my children dying and they're asking me these questions!<eos> Of course the needle's gonna be jumping!<eos> And you two are supposed to be representing me! You're supposed to be in the room.
These are very serious crimes.<eos> I was, um... I was with O.J. this morning, and he, uh he was in pretty bad shape.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He was in a lot of pain.<eos> He left a note.<eos> And we have reason to believe that he's killed himself.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He wanted you to know, he wanted all of you to know he loved you... he loved you very much.
- How'd you get this number?<eos> - You called 911.<eos> Well, you tell the cops to back off!<eos> All right? Stay away from us!<eos> A.C., give me the phone.<eos> Hey, this is O.J.<eos> I just wanted to say how sorry I am.<eos> I didn't mean for you guys to all have to come out like this.<eos> I know it's late on a Friday.<eos> You guys work hard.
Hey, this is O.J.<eos> I just wanted to say how sorry I am.<eos> I didn't mean for you guys to all have to come out like this.<eos> I know it's late on a Friday.<eos> You guys work hard.<eos> Probably want to go home and see your kids.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> We're just doing our jobs.<eos> So, uh... I understand you have a gun.<eos> Yeah, but it's not for you.

That's-that's real important.<eos> - Okay? - All right, man. All right.<eos> Good.<eos> Stay with me, yes?<eos> Okay, come on in, come on in. Stay with me.<eos> Simpson's about to exit the vehicle.<eos> Subject will not be armed.<eos> No hotheads.<eos> We're on TV.<eos> Don't fire unless you're fired upon first.
They leaked the Fuhrman story.<eos> They play the race card.<eos> I would never.<eos> I hold myself to the highest ethical standards.<eos> I would never reduce myself to such cheap tricks.<eos> - Bob, calm down.<eos> - No, no, Lee, Lee. I'm very upset.<eos> These claims should be sanctioned.<eos> How dare they say that we play the race card.<eos> I stand before you right now and say race has never and will never be an issue in this case.
No, of course not.<eos> You know uncle juice.<eos> You know he would never hurt anyone.<eos> Well, mom says he did.<eos> Look, your mother...<eos> Your mother's very emotional right now.<eos> And i understand that;<eos> she lost nicole.<eos> We all lost nicole.<eos> But... She shouldn't be talking to you about these things.
If we skipped lunch and just worked through the afternoon?<eos> I got a lot to cover, and i'm on a 5:30 back to boston.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that's how this is gonna work.<eos> I'll come out often, but my manpower's back at harvard.<eos> Harvard.<eos> So, then, the first week Culminates with simpson deciding to make a run for it<eos> While under your supervision... Careful.<eos> ...Leaving behind a letter that sounds like<eos> An admission of guilt, that you guys, For some mystifying reason, read aloud on television.
Did you know shapiro represented bailey In the longest drunk-driving trial in american history? It's true, 11 days.<eos> Dershowitz-- appeals expert,<eos> Which tells you they're assuming conviction.<eos> Kardashian-- i literally did not realize he was a lawyer. It's really sad.<eos> The most famous collection of expensive lawyers in the world<eos> Trying to buy o.J. Out of trouble.<eos> And everyone's jumping on the gravy train. Look at this one.<eos> O.J.'s golf caddy has insight<eos> Into his state of mind the day of the murders.<eos> If this moron shows up on a witness list, One of you gets fired.
But right now, it's an emotional thing, Not a rational one.<eos> Might be hard for you to understand.<eos> Since you never get emotional about your cases.<eos> Dad's here!<eos> I need to find my phone!<eos> I can't find my shoe!<eos> Hey. How are you?<eos> Wait here. Okay? I'll get them.<eos> Whoa, what's-what's wrong?<eos> You guys have a movie to get to.
You turn over control of a demonstration to the opponent, you don't know what's going to happen.<eos> And certainly not to the defendant himself.<eos> Okay?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Do you think there's any way that these two gloves could not be a pair?<eos> I'd have to say it would be virtually impossible.<eos> All right, at this time, we will take a 15-minute recess.<eos> Hello, Mike.<eos> Bob.<eos> Are any of you interested in something other than a conspiracy theory?
Four.<eos> And now this.<eos> An anonymous letter claiming to be from a literary agent's receptionist, and it says, I quote, "An older white female juror "is shopping a book proposal called Standing Alone:<eos> A Vote for Nicole."<eos> May I?<eos> Well... this is clearly an attempt by the defense to remove a juror they don't like.<eos> I suggest you throw it in the trash where it belongs.<eos> I certainly hope you're not suggesting that we sent that letter.<eos> Oh, I certainly am.<eos> - You and your sleazy investigator. - Sleazy?
They treat us like we're second class, like we're criminals or something.<eos> I can't take it anymore.<eos> I just want to go home, please.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> You know what, we are way overdue for a deputy rotation, so what I can do is I can change them out, and I would just ask if you would please give that a chance, okay?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who the hell is you supposed to be?
But that is what you're suggesting.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I suggest nothing!<eos> - Oh, yes, you did!<eos> - I did not. - Yes, you did.<eos> - Don't put words in my mouth! And that has created a lot of problems for myself and for my family.<eos> You continually make statements about me and race, Mr. Cochran...<eos> Wait. Wait, all right, stop it, both of you!<eos> This is all improper.<eos> And I'm so mad at both of you guys right now, I'm about to hold the two of you in contempt.
I have a winning record in that jurisdiction.<eos> I tried over 200 cases there.<eos> 200?<eos> Really? When?<eos> Seems like yesterday.<eos> But understand this:<eos> things change really slowly down South.<eos> And I know the Carolinas like I know the caramel color in a single-barrel apple brandy, sipped over the blush of the morning sunrise.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Really? I hired all of you.
I'm flying back to New York. Vacation talk?<eos> Whew. I need one.<eos> Heading to the airport.<eos> I got a speech in San Francisco.<eos> You know what I would do, if I had the spare time?<eos> I would go up to Oscar De La Hoya's training camp and I would spend my day sparring and-and hitting the heavy bag.<eos> Bob, airport.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've never been a foreperson before.<eos> I've never even been on a jury before, so if any of you have suggestions,
I want you to know I admire you for what you did.<eos> For what?<eos> For botching an air-tight case?<eos> For... for making the case for the people of California.<eos> Given what they threw at you, there were a lot of temptations to play their game.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> We are all profoundly disappointed with this verdict.<eos> But it was clear to me and to the prosecution that this was an emotional trial.<eos> And apparently, the jury's decision was based on... emotion and not reason.<eos> None of you will know the sacrifices that this team and their families made.

Look at what we got here!<eos> Thank you. Look at this spread. - It's so...<eos> - Last minute. It's the best we could find at the market.<eos> Thank you. Thank you, darling.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> From the very beginning, you encouraged me to do it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And to you, brother, the whole way.<eos> To you all, thank you.

Tommy, Arthur, Collins, may I introduce you to the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna...<eos> Grand Duchess, may I introduce you to the Shelby brothers?<eos> Small Heath, Birmingham.<eos> And, erm, good luck with this one, Tom.<eos> Give me the money.<eos> I was told to give it to Mr Kaledin.<eos> Whoever it is up there, he gave the wrong name.<eos> We asked him the name and he gave the wrong one.<eos> - What name did he give?<eos> I don't trust any of you.
Mommy.<eos> - Mommy?<eos> - Oh. I like the colonoscopy idea.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - But, Walter, I... I don't want to.<eos> Jim, you're doing it.<eos> This colonoscopy broadcast to millions could save lives.<eos> Dr. Mendelson and Beth are here for your cognitive therapy, Major.<eos> Thank you, Harry.<eos> All of you, there is something you can do for me.
- Oh, my God.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Excuse me, waiter, there appears to be a dress in my soup.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This is Shelly Tinkle, here today and tomorrow.<eos> No.<eos> This is Shelly Tinkle bringing the news.<eos> I'm just bringing it, to you. No.
Oh, I'm so excited.<eos> Do I have time to use the bathroom?<eos> - No, hold it.<eos> - Shelly, we have Walter.<eos> Go with the prepared questions.<eos> In five, four...<eos> - Let's do this shit...<eos> - ... three, two, one.<eos> Welcome back to Blunt Talk.<eos> Tonight we have something really exciting for you, a very special guest...
After the break, we'll have more on this tangled web of corruption which has reached all the way here to UBS.<eos> CEO Arthur Bronson has been forced to resign in the wake of revelations of improper business affairs with Rudolph Global.<eos> We'll be back after this.<eos> To all my friends, cheers. - Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - To friends.<eos> Mr. Blunt, you're up.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> Which one of you put my name down?
What?<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> Which one of you put my name down?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't worry, Walter.<eos> You know this song.<eos> Oh, you're in luck.<eos> I do know this song.<eos> Well, this is for... the woman who broke my heart 30 years ago.<eos> It was the best thing she could ever have done because otherwise I would never have met all of you.
We never should have left Winterfell.<eos> Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?<eos> I want to scream at myself, "Don't go, you idiot."<eos> How could we know?<eos> I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.<eos> I wish I could change everything.<eos> We were children.<eos> I was awful, just admit it.<eos> You were occasionally awful.<eos> I'm sure I can't have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
- Not anymore.<eos> - You think you're a free man now?<eos> You still follow orders.<eos> Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.<eos> Friends, friends, friends, please.<eos> There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing.<eos> That is the way of the world. I'm not here to change the way of the world.<eos> Slavery is the way of our world.<eos> You don't need slaves to make money.<eos> There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you.
I had to work hard to get him talking.<eos> But he talked.<eos> They all do.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> All about the Stark boys, who helped them escape, and how she did it.<eos> Open the gate!<eos> Sorry about the food.<eos> It's not what we're known for.<eos> That's all right. There are more important things.<eos> A letter for you, Lord Commander.
A girl has decided.<eos> A servant does not ask questions.<eos> It was you.<eos> You made the white walkers.<eos> We were at war.<eos> We were being slaughtered.<eos> Our sacred trees cut down.<eos> We needed to defend ourselves.<eos> From whom?<eos> From you.
Now I know what my first act as queen will be.<eos> To execute the man who killed my father.<eos> I did.<eos> I killed him.<eos> Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall.<eos> He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.<eos> No one loved him.<eos> No one wanted to follow him.<eos> He led us into two wars we couldn't win.<eos> I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?<eos> You were gone.<eos> Yara was here.<eos> Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.<eos> Getting ready to bring us back to glory.<eos> And how will she do that?<eos> I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.<eos> Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it.<eos> I've been all over the world.<eos> I've seen more of it than all of you combined.
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.<eos> Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.<eos> He can wield a sword.<eos> He killed a Thenn.<eos> He killed a white walker.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.<eos> He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.<eos> He risked his own life to save mine more than once.<eos> He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.<eos> No worse child ever stained this land.<eos> Curse the day I named you.<eos> My greatest crime.<eos> Now I must flee.<eos> Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.<eos> Don't fear winter.<eos> Fear me!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,

The Mother watches over us all.<eos> I'll see you soon, my dear.<eos> Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.<eos> Shall we pray?<eos> We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to.<eos> These aren't white walkers.<eos> This isn't an army of the dead.<eos> This isn't our fight.<eos> If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.<eos> All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.
It stretched all the way to the horizon.<eos> And look at us now.<eos> Look what's left of us.<eos> And if we lose this, we're gone.<eos> Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.<eos> Be like we were never there at all.<eos> We'll be the last of the free folk.<eos> That's what'll happen to you if we lose.<eos> The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here.<eos> They know that more than half of you are women and children.
I shouldn't be asking you.<eos> It's not the deal we made.<eos> I need you with me if we're going to beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.<eos> The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would.<eos> He died for us.<eos> If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.<eos> And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.<eos> Snow.<eos> Are you sure they'll come?<eos> We're not clever like you southerners.
I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.<eos> Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.<eos> All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world.<eos> That's all any of us can do, isn't it?<eos> Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.<eos> Start helping people.<eos> It's never too late to come back.<eos> And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.<eos> It's not even about the gods.<eos> It's about you.
It's never too late to come back.<eos> And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.<eos> It's not even about the gods.<eos> It's about you.<eos> Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.<eos> Seven save you, friends.<eos> How can we help you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we're talking about life.<eos> You?
More.<eos> Much more.<eos> You seem happy.<eos> I am happy.<eos> You should both be happy as well.<eos> Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.<eos> Now it's like a man reborn.<eos> I will be happy when our queen returns.<eos> Why don't you drink?<eos> Why don't either of you ever drink?
Dracarys.<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> Thank you for the armada.<eos> Our queen does love ships.<eos> Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.<eos> You violated that pact.<eos> You declared war upon us.<eos> Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.<eos> Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
Fear is his power.<eos> It's his weakness, too.<eos> His men don't want to fight for him.<eos> They're forced to fight for him.<eos> If they feel the tide turning...<eos> It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses.<eos> I know what mounted knights can do to us.<eos> You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.<eos> We're digging trenches all along our flanks.<eos> They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.
He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.<eos> I believed in him.<eos> I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.<eos> But I was wrong just like you.<eos> Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.<eos> Jon Snow's not a king.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.<eos> You want some?<eos> I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.<eos> Jon.<eos> A raven came from the Citadel.<eos> A white raven.<eos> Winter is here.<eos> Well, Father always promised, didn't he?<eos> The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated.<eos> 100 red scorpions, was it?<eos> You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.<eos> You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?
She was a quick study.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> As king, I welcome you to the Order of the Chosen.<eos> At the dawn of every new year, we gather in this sacred garden to recount the story of the Ellcrys.<eos> Thousands of years ago... our Elven ancestors fought a war against an army of Demons.<eos> The Elves were at the point of annihilation, when their elders turned to magic.<eos> Using this powerful gift, they managed to imprison the Demons in a realm known as the Forbidding.<eos> The Ellcrys was created to stand sentry.<eos> As long as it lives, the Demons are locked up for all eternity.<eos> Now, I realize that for some of you, this is merely... folklore.
Is he breathing?<eos> You worry about your own people, I'll take care of Wil.<eos> What are you gonna do, girl?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> I think you've already proven you aren't up to the task.<eos> Actually, I think I'll just kill you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just give me the Stones and I'll let you both walk away.<eos> Allanon?<eos> You two are supposed to be in Arborlon.
This is only the beginning.<eos> More will come.<eos> And what makes you think Wil and I can do anything to stop them?<eos> Because you share a destiny.<eos> A greater purpose.<eos> Yeah, and if you're wrong?<eos> The events leading us to this moment have been unfurling for centuries.<eos> Wil lies here because he has yet to reconcile who he is with who the Stones already know him to be.<eos> You ran the Gauntlet trying to find your place in life and yet destiny had already found it for you.<eos> Everything, all of this, is not happening because of you, it is happening to you.
Let him speak!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I know what you're all thinking.<eos> That the things you're hearing are too incredible to be true.<eos> But magic and demons are real.<eos> I have seen them with my own eyes.<eos> Quite frankly, all I want to do is run away.<eos> Then I met Amberle.<eos> She might have been frightened, but she's also incredibly brave.<eos> She didn't have to come back, but she did, for all of you, the people she loves.

There's nowhere to run, Eretria.<eos> Don't let her escape.<eos> The cloak's a nice touch, Rover, but your boots gave you away.<eos> Excellent work, Commander Tilton.<eos> Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> Prince Ander assisted with the apprehension.<eos> If by assisted you mean got his ass kicked, yeah, he was a big help.<eos> Rover, do you have a name?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> We all look the same to you, anyway.
"Three"?<eos> Princess, Rover, Elf, and Druid makes four.<eos> Allanon wasn't in my vision.<eos> If the Dagda Mor sends more Demons, we must be ready for them here.<eos> That is why you three... must travel to Safehold together.<eos> Do you recognize this?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> Oh, we might get there soon enough.<eos> "We"?<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
I want Rin Katsin brought there immediately.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Something happen when people touch you?<eos> He's a seer.<eos> - You killed him.<eos> - It wasn't the Princess.<eos> It was a Changeling.<eos> It can inhabit the form of any being it chooses.<eos> You need to start trusting the Ellcrys.<eos> Otherwise the three of you will not make it to Safehold.
In the wilderness?<eos> So you started collecting Elf ears for a living?<eos> Sit.<eos> I'm impressed with how you took out my hunters.<eos> Not bad for a pampered princess and her...<eos> What are you anyway?<eos> Her pet?<eos> You're an embarrassment to the Human race.<eos> Well, coming from you, I'll take it as a compliment.<eos> I don't know what's going on between the two of you, but you need to let us go.
I know what happens!<eos> If you think I am pushing you, it's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come.<eos> You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor.<eos> You're pushing to see if I snap.<eos> It's not fun... having your mind read, is it?<eos> Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it. And with whom.<eos> It all looks the same.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I'll head down here.<eos> You guys check that way.
Double back in five minutes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you run into a Troll, go for its eyes.<eos> It's their weak spot.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I should go with you.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Elfstones won't work against Trolls anyway.<eos> And killing them isn't exactly your strong suit.<eos> I think I liked it better when you two weren't friends.
I'll be fine.<eos> Elfstones won't work against Trolls anyway.<eos> And killing them isn't exactly your strong suit.<eos> I think I liked it better when you two weren't friends.<eos> Five minutes, not a second later.<eos> You said you were stepping down.<eos> You made a fool of me.<eos> You need to understand, Councilwoman.<eos> I have seen the evil that's coming.<eos> If we hope to survive, I need you at my side.

That tunnel must lead to the Bloodfire.<eos> I agree.<eos> It... it can't be a coincidence.<eos> Maybe you guys didn't notice, but there are three heavily-armed trolls in that room... how are we supposed to get past them?<eos> We've fought worse.<eos> Wait.<eos> Maybe there's another way.<eos> If the Gnome's letter is true, it could turn the tide of war.<eos> Have you told the Council?<eos> No one knows but the two of you.
You're not getting away that easy.<eos> You're not getting away at all.<eos> Bandon... you're hurting me...<eos> Bandon, stop...<eos> Catania!<eos> We made it.<eos> Okay... so where is the Bloodfire?<eos> It's here...<eos> I can feel it.<eos> In my vision, you guys were standing beneath the window.
Now what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we need to figure it out.<eos> No one enters, no one leaves...<eos> Wait, do you hear that?<eos> No one enters.<eos> No one leaves.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Guardians of the Bloodfire.<eos> Who among you dares to seek ...the Bloodfire?
You're confused, Princess. I was in this just to earn some coin.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> Eretria...<eos> You came here for the map. Not for me.<eos> What map?<eos> The map to Safehold.<eos> Now, why don't you fill your boyfriend in while I go get the map?<eos> I'll meet you outside in five minutes.<eos> And if we refuse to leave?<eos> Then I'll tell every Human in here about you. And your pointy ears.
Cheers!<eos> You must be Eretria's friends.<eos> It is said that a warrior who dies fearlessly in battle will reap many rewards in the afterlife.<eos> If that is true... then my father and brother will stand tall before the Holy Mountain... the richest of men.<eos> And it is time for me to make a sacrifice in their honor.<eos> One that I've discussed with Counselor Kael.<eos> I will give...<eos> I will give my solemn vow... to battle bravely in the name of the Four Lands.<eos> The Demons are coming for us. And we will not back down.<eos> I will fight with you and beside you... as your king!
_<eos> Our hope lies in a single seed being carried here by your Princess Amberle and the last son of Shannara.<eos> With it, we can send this demon horde back to the Forbidding.<eos> For this to happen, we must buy them time.<eos> We must hold this line... and defend the Ellcrys at all costs.<eos> I know we can win this war because I have stood alongside your King Eventine and, as fate would have it, I now stand alongside his son,<eos> King Ander.<eos> All Hail King Ander!<eos> Your princess is out there, right now.<eos> Scared... just like you.
Forward!<eos> Is there a secret way in?<eos> A back door or something?<eos> No, not this far out.<eos> It's a patrol.<eos> It smells us.<eos> Die, you bastard.<eos> Allanon.<eos> Perfect timing as usual.<eos> I wish I could say the same for you but the idea was to get here before the demons arrived.
It was my duty.<eos> I sent soldiers to find my brother's body, but there was no sign of him or the Warlock sword.<eos> I saw him in there, Allanon.<eos> Even in that twisted form...<eos> it was Arion.<eos> He asked me to kill him.<eos> The Dagda Mor's cruelty had no bounds.<eos> Haven't been to the Sanctuary yet to see Amberle.<eos> I know her sacrifice saved us, but I just can't believe that she's gone.<eos> She is still with you, My Grace.
We're all just in a rut.<eos> We should do something to shake it up.<eos> Ooh, how about this race thing I read about in The Village Voice?<eos> Oh, Lord, can we go a day without having a discussion about race?<eos> It's a running race to the top of the Empire State Building.<eos> I don't want to do that, either.<eos> That sounds like fun.<eos> We can train on the stairs in my building.<eos> We can totally motivate each other. Yes, I am in!<eos> Yeah, good for you.
We are in a phase of evolution where we have to embrace love.<eos> We have to see love, feel love, touch love, heal love.<eos> From the very core of our inner sanction.<eos> Right?<eos> You guys know what I'm talking about.<eos> Come on, let me hear you.<eos> Holy fuck.<eos> You guys are doing it right.<eos> Seriously.<eos> All of you guys, this is, like, what your twenties should be about.
That's, technically, I'm--<eos> I'm in an incestuous relationship right now, okay?<eos> Don't judge us.<eos> I'm not judging you, okay?<eos> It's just...<eos> It's a surprise, and in all fairness... you two should've told me.<eos> Okay, dude.<eos> You know what? Sorry that we tried to fuck you.<eos> No. I... I didn't mean it-- Uh, it's just...<eos> I mean, maybe, like, one of you stays?
Then there's the self-certification of your personal conduct, where you declare you don't have any legal matters pending, that you don't use prohibited substances...<eos> What the fuck is this ?<eos> He's signing a false statement, he just wants to steal everything as usual.<eos> Is that what he said ?<eos> He told you that ? Of course...<eos> Who knows how many other things he hasn't told you.<eos> Listen, you're obliging two minors to keep a drug addict in the house.<eos> Giulia, think before you speak, because if you declare that,<eos> I have to take note of it and declare him unsuitable.<eos> But for now there's no choice, if he doesn't stay with you, and there are no other close relatives, the court will foster you out immediately.
And don't drink from the kid's glass, or touch his milk.<eos> Do what you want outside the house, but no getting high at home.<eos> 30 euros a day.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Expensive for a bath.<eos> - No, you'll train me.<eos> You'll give me a hand.<eos> - I'll train you ?<eos> - Every day.<eos> And I'll give you 30 euros and feed you both.
How are you ?<eos> It's been a shitty day, I feel really bad.<eos> Will you tell me what he wanted, please ?<eos> He offered me a race to repay the debt.<eos> What race ?<eos> The Italian Race.<eos> See ? See that I'm right ?<eos> That it's not worth fighting for anything.<eos> I'm an idiot, because I trust people.<eos> I'm here with you trying to be a normal person, fuck it !
What can you teach ?<eos> Listen to me, we only have one more race, if I win it, everything's solved.<eos> Do what the fuck you want. You want to go and steal ? Steal, get high, kill yourself.<eos> But leave us alone.<eos> Can't you see the shape you're in ?<eos> You're worthless.<eos> You haven't got a job, you've never done anything, you're even missing teeth.<eos> And take that fucking brace off, there's nothing under it.<eos> Fuck you<eos> I let my woman leave to stay with you.
But I don't remember.<eos> Well...<eos> Your grandson's a storyteller.<eos> He'll tell you all the stories you've forgotten.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello, Mother.<eos> Father.<eos> I know my stories can tend to get a little, um, long, so I'll keep this brief.<eos> I'm very grateful I've had the chance to meet you both, hear your wisdom, feel your kindness, even eat a meal sitting between you.

Mom just said we needed some.<eos> Here you go, John.<eos> It's for cooking.<eos> This is Ted rath with an update on the Clayton killer situation.<eos> Now this reporter has discovered there is an Emmet t.<eos> Openshaw an Arizona man who disappeared from his home 42 years ago.<eos> He was 30 at the time.<eos> Police found signs of struggle but there was no body found at the scene.<eos> Now the reason this crime connects to what's happening here in Clayton county is they found a similar pile of black oil at the crime scene.<eos> Good morning, Mrs. crowley, um, I thought I could shovel your steps for you.
Um, Roger Bowen, uh, this is my son, Max.<eos> This is his bat. He left it at school.<eos> Uh, listen, people are upset and, uh, we should really... Calm down, everybody!<eos> This is no way to handle this situation.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> I think everybody here is concerned about the safety of our streets.<eos> We have got to stick together.<eos> There is a killer in our town.<eos> I look at all these faces and I...<eos> I don't want to lose a single one of you.
That's what he was doing out there at that hour on a street carrying about in his nightgown out looking for some kid.<eos> I couldn't help him.<eos> Where is it?<eos> How long do you think you've got?<eos> Long enough to find another.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not in front of everybody.<eos> You don't know the things I've done or that I will do.<eos> Don't forget to take the book of condolence to the cemetery, John.<eos> The family is so grateful for all your wonderful cards and flowers and, and some of you have asked about donations.
Jackie:<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> And they ask me will I do the honors?<eos> All the pioneers in the record business will be there.<eos> Pioneers.<eos> Wow.<eos> Pioneers?<eos> Daniel Boone, Lewis and Clark...<eos> those are pioneers, okay?<eos> The putzes in this room, you putzes, I guarantee you not one of you has been west of 10th Avenue. - (laughing)
You need to learn her name and stop treating her like the maid.<eos> Gloria runs the board because she knows the people who are going to make this happen.<eos> Paul Newman lives half a mile from here. Gloria knew that.<eos> I just knew this was a barn with no one in it.<eos> (scoffs) Face like a crow.<eos> We're going to need another table.<eos> We can't fit 60 people at six tables if they're all in a line.<eos> Makes it feel more intimate. Like Libor's made everyone dinner.<eos> Sweetheart, if you're making us all dinner, why am I paying a caterer?<eos> Without you, I have only dreams.
I have seen a bear.<eos> - You, at night in the snow. In your dream.<eos> Learning prefer harder instead of hanging out in the woods.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Tom, pack the honey?<eos> When you stay will'm doing good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No thanks.<eos> You do not seem very enthusiastic.<eos> - Why should I live with you?
When you're finished kowtowing at the foot of your pope return to me with word.<eos> Of?<eos> Anything that might be deemed significant.<eos> You mean anything you deem significant.<eos> Tell your pope I look forward to the day of meeting him in his city.<eos> Enjoy what remains of the day.<eos> - Oh, we'll share several... if I can get outside.<eos> Your prodigal son's returned.<eos> He wouldn't dare miss his brother's wedding.<eos> He wishes to speak with you, urgently.
Did I ask you to speak?<eos> No, Uncle Silla.<eos> If I didn't ask you to speak, why do you keep saying my name?<eos> I'm dying of thirst.<eos> Is there water? !<eos> Of course there is water.<eos> If I had run as far as you, I would want water, too.<eos> But what you want is of no importance.<eos> I am your Kintago!<eos> Peace be with you.

Boy just got scared, that's all.<eos> I can teach him better. Just give me one more...<eos> Always acting so cocksure and pleased, as if we're the same!<eos> I ain't the same as you!<eos> I'm not a nigger, understand?<eos> ! I ain't no nigger.<eos> You ain't the same!<eos> I ain't the same!<eos> We ain't the same!<eos> I don't never want to be the same as you!

Sell him.<eos> Or you'll ruin this farm.<eos> The other gentry will laugh at you.<eos> The African boy, he's young.<eos> He's got... he's got years of work in him.<eos> Not this one.<eos> You can't trust Fiddler.<eos> Don't do this, Massa.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I spent all my life working with you.
They don't care about your marks.<eos> Only your family status.<eos> I surrender, my friend.<eos> I will accept the position at your ministry... but only until I'm able to find an engineering job.<eos> What makes you think I still have a job for you?<eos> So, you would be willing to restore hope... and transform the lives of children through sports.<eos> Full time.<eos> I would.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Katwe needs you.
I can teach you.<eos> I don't want.<eos> Too bad, eh?<eos> I thought you might like beating city boys.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When I was at school, the city boys with their gold watches, they loved this game.<eos> They had contests to see who was the best.<eos> I'm ready when you're ready.<eos> Me, I was an orphan.<eos> So, like you, I had no gold watch... but I practiced my chess.
You are too mature for such tears, ah?<eos> But I was champion.<eos> You will be champion again.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Madam! Madam! Madam!<eos> Hey!<eos> These children are not helpers for your gambling games!<eos> Madam, you misunderstand our work.<eos> I know the work you men do.
No.<eos> But I've made a personal decision, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty. President.<eos> A few moments ago - I handed over to His Majesty, King Haakon VII, my resignation as Prime Minister, and at the same time, the renouncement of this Government.<eos> I'll be brief, because we have a lot to do.<eos> As the King of Norway, I can do nothing more than to accept the resignation of the Government.<eos> But not now.<eos> President of Parliament, Hambro, has decided not to accept the resignation, a decision that I support.<eos> This is not the time for negotiations behind closed doors or agreements between small groups.<eos> It's time to be open with each other, and I will be totally open with you.
Why don't you guys try a few complete sentences?<eos> This conversation sounds like a fucking E.E. Cummings poem.<eos> Wow, I feel good, man.<eos> I feel incredible.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yeah, I thought meditation was just naps, but it's like a whole thing.<eos> Well, you know, it is.<eos> It's like naps where you wake up.<eos> And I'm so happy to be able to share that with both of you.
- Thank you.<eos> Yeah, I thought meditation was just naps, but it's like a whole thing.<eos> Well, you know, it is.<eos> It's like naps where you wake up.<eos> And I'm so happy to be able to share that with both of you.<eos> And you, you, oh!<eos> - I'm so proud of you, man.<eos> - Oh, thank you, baby.<eos> Yes, you guys, listen.<eos> You guys, all of you.
- Her mother's a fucking lunatic.<eos> Hannah is just being Hannah.<eos> Shoshanna, since she got back from Japan is somehow even more like a cartoon.<eos> I'm just trying to be a source of support.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's good, be of service. Mm-hmm.<eos> And how is it over there?<eos> You guys just, like, doing circle jerks and pounding beers?
I wore shoulder pads to my wedding and I regret it every time I look at those photos.<eos> More than you regret marrying the sex addict who's also in those photos?<eos> Uh, yeah, 'cause that was fun for a while.<eos> Well, you know, I was on the Vans Warped Tour this summer and I saw Vanessa Hudgens in the pit and she had one of these crowns on and you look just like her.<eos> Well, that's just great and weird.<eos> Just when we ask for second opinions, we'll come to you right away, okay?<eos> - We're good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And this is my daughter and this is my day.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna start on someone else while you two work this thing out, all right?
- and just went, like... - It's just a lot.<eos> Well, have you ever even worn makeup before?<eos> Yes, I wear mascara every Saturday.<eos> Yeah, um, the dress is light, so we have to weigh it down with makeup.<eos> You guys think that maybe this is a little bit heavy?<eos> You know what?<eos> You all are a bunch of bitches.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> Sophia Bush, grateful.<eos> You, twats.
I think she looks great.<eos> It's like you take a tiny bit of tissue and you've got this on lock.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's...<eos> They're so nice.<eos> Mother of the bride!<eos> And the girls!<eos> It's all happening, gentlemen.<eos> Made it to the altar.<eos> And I owe it all to you.
That's not true.<eos> You were returning here to your home.<eos> What I do is I run up and down the block multiple times till I feel like I'm gonna barf.<eos> It's basically a mile. What are you doing here?<eos> Hannah, you haven't returned any of our phone calls.<eos> Not one. Honey, I called you 23 times the other day.<eos> Yeah, does that not strike you as a bit psycho?<eos> We just want to spend some time with you, honey, okay?<eos> As a normal family unit.<eos> Well, I would say "normal family unit" kind of went out the window when one of you became gay and the other started dressing like Pat Benatar.
We just want to spend some time with you, honey, okay?<eos> As a normal family unit.<eos> Well, I would say "normal family unit" kind of went out the window when one of you became gay and the other started dressing like Pat Benatar.<eos> Please be open to us, Hannah.<eos> Be open to the time we want to spend with you.<eos> I have to finish my run.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> No, Mom, you don't know. I've been running a lot.<eos> I'm not sure if you've heard of "endor-phins,"<eos> but they've been really helping me. Helping me to deal with you.
She loves babies.<eos> She's always trying to accidentally French them.<eos> Why the fuck would you mention Hannah right now?<eos> I'm sorry, I can't mention her?<eos> - Can't even have thoughts about her?<eos> - Um, no, you can think it all you want, but don't feel the need to share it with me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm thinking about her right now.<eos> Banana, you don't seem like you're having fun with us.<eos> I'm not. You guys are depressing.
- How's it going?<eos> Where's Tandace?<eos> Yeah, she... fuck, her dad died,<eos> - so she, er, she had to take five.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Was it a... sudden, or...?<eos> I don't really know the details, but it sounded pretty serious, you know?<eos> Desi, look, I, ah, I'm gonna be joining you guys on the tour, um, carrying guitar cases, fetching snacks, and so on.
Come in with me and get warm.<eos> Move up.<eos> Rostov!<eos> I didn't expect you so soon!<eos> Sorry. You know Captain Berg?<eos> - He's in our company.<eos> - Happy to make your acquaintance.<eos> Well. You look... I don't know...<eos> And you look like the cat that's got the cream.<eos> You Guards get the best of everything, don't you?
Don't get up.<eos> Please don't let me interrupt you, sir.<eos> Count Nikolai Rostov, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.<eos> Please go on.<eos> You were in the cavalry charge in Schongrabern, you say? - Yes, I was there.<eos> - Yes.<eos> There are many stories told of that action.<eos> Perhaps. But the stories told by the men who were actually there, under enemy fire, in the thick of it, are a different thing to the stories told by fellows on the staff who get rewards for doing nothing.<eos> And you consider me one of those, do you?<eos> I'm not talking about you.
I won't stay, Drubetskoy.<eos> We can settle our business tomorrow.<eos> I wish you all good day.<eos> Damn him.<eos> He's as good as called me a liar! Come, come.<eos> Drink up.<eos> Some of us know a hero when we meet one.<eos> To Prince Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky.<eos> My dear Prince, I shall shortly be in your neighbourhood. I'm going to an inspection and my son Anatole is keeping me company on his way to the army.<eos> I hope you will allow me to introduce him to you and to your daughter, the Princess Marya.
Between my son and your lovely daughter.<eos> Look, I know how dear the Princess is to you.<eos> I could understand if you couldn't bear to part with her.<eos> Part with her?<eos> She could marry tomorrow.<eos> But I won't have her taken advantage of. You know my rules.<eos> Everything in the open.<eos> I'll ask her tomorrow in your presence.<eos> If she wants him, let him stay a while, then I'll see.<eos> I'll be frank with you.
Let her marry him is she wants.<eos> It's all the same to me.<eos> You're very good.<eos> - I'm most grateful.<eos> Goodnight, Princess.<eos> Mademoiselle Bourienne.<eos> When?<eos> No.<eos> When I've heard from your father that you've learnt to behave yourselves, then I'll give you my hand to kiss.<eos> Well, then, I shall wish you ladies goodnight.
When?<eos> No.<eos> When I've heard from your father that you've learnt to behave yourselves, then I'll give you my hand to kiss.<eos> Well, then, I shall wish you ladies goodnight.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> She's damnably dull-looking, isn't she? Poor little thing.<eos> But did she like you?<eos> Ah, yes, I think so.<eos> Well, could you put up with her, do you think?<eos> To please you, Papa, yes, I could.
My dear Princess, this is a moment I shall never forget.<eos> Will you not give me a little hope of touching so great, so generous a heart?<eos> Say that perhaps. The future is so large.<eos> Say perhaps.<eos> Princess Marya, I... I do hope I haven't offended you in any way.<eos> May I not return and try again?<eos> Prince Vassily, uh, I've said all that I feel in my heart.<eos> I thank you for the honour but I shall never be your son's wife.<eos> Yes, well, that's the end of that, then.<eos> Very good to see you, Kuragin and your boy, and I wish you both a safe journey.
Wounded.<eos> Taken away in a cart. - Where?<eos> - That way, Excellency.<eos> That'll do.<eos> How beautiful.<eos> How is it I've never seen this before?<eos> We are all nothing compared to this clear, blue, infinite sky.<eos> He looks like a fine young man.<eos> A good way to die, you see, carrying the standard.<eos> Oh, it's you.
I hope you'll make yourself at home here.<eos> Thank you, I shall.<eos> Don't, don't...<eos> Let's have a drink!<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Helene!<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for making poor Dolokhov so welcome.<eos> Oh, Pierre.<eos> What?<eos> Can't you see he's making a fool out of you?
Now I see you, I wish I'd come sooner.<eos> How are you all?<eos> Nikolai...<eos> You're a real man now.<eos> I can tell. Something's changed in you, I think.<eos> - For the good, I hope?<eos> - Yes, yes, of course.<eos> My friend, Captain Vassily Denisov of the Pavlograd Hussars.<eos> I'm privileged to meet you, sir.<eos> I feel ashamed of my lazy life when I see men like you and Nikolai.
Papa's... Papa's hosting a banquet for our returning soldiers.<eos> I hope you'll come, Pierre?<eos> Yes, yes, indeed.<eos> It will be an honour to drink to their health.<eos> Talking of heroes, isn't Dolokhov making his home with you?<eos> Yes. Yes, he is.<eos> It was so kind of you to take him in.<eos> Well, one does what one can.<eos> Splendid fellow.<eos> It's so good to be here with you all again.
Yes, I think you're right.<eos> I'll go and see to it.<eos> No.<eos> Can it be?<eos> So soon?<eos> But surely it's just a stomachache?<eos> It's best to be on the safe side, ma chérie.<eos> When did this come?<eos> - Just now, Your Excellency. - Thank you.<eos> "Perhaps you should get some new spectacles, Count Bezukhov, "then you might see what everyone sees but you. "Your wife's affair with Dolokhov. "
- What's the matter?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Well, I'm going out.<eos> Are you going to the men's dinner this evening?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> I suppose I might as well.<eos> Why not?<eos> Your disgusting friend Dolokhov's going.<eos> Try not to drink too much, the pair of you.
! I told you not to take the side action!<eos> You bitch.<eos> You bitch. Why didn't you yell it so I could hear it?<eos> I'm tired of yelling.<eos> Damn it. Now we got to figure out where Dee goes in the bed.<eos> Oh, right, Dee's got to be in the bed.<eos> Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll tell you exactly where Dee goes, okay?<eos> Dee goes right in the goddamn middle of her brand-new California king-size bed all by herself.<eos> How are we even having this conversation? !<eos> All you boys have to do...
Yeah, they just put the big...<eos> the helmets on.<eos> My mom just got that.<eos> She and her bridge club friends play it sometimes.<eos> Is that the board you talk to ghost?<eos> Uh, then.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I get enough of that at home.<eos> It's actually really scary.<eos> You guys want to play?
Hi, young lady, is Lina home?<eos> Yeah, she's right here.<eos> Hey, ready to go?<eos> Hi.<eos> Who are you?<eos> He's just a friend.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Zander, I'm Mikey.<eos> - Are you ready to go?<eos> - Not quite.<eos> If you guys are walking to school why don't you take your sister with you.
Did you see her writing these, actually writing them?<eos> - Yes, right over there?<eos> - Um. Sometimes the medium gets confuse, different voices...<eos> I tricked her.<eos> What are those?<eos> Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<eos> For many false prophets have gone out into the world.<eos> John, chapter 4 verse 1.<eos> I thought this was about Lina.<eos> It's about all of you.
Look at me.<eos> - No.<eos> We have to find your sister.<eos> What's that?<eos> The basement.<eos> Lina, wait outside.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No, that's my sister.<eos> This is my house and I'm going with you. Besides, splitting up sounds like the stupidest idea in the world.
What do you want me to drive with you?<eos> [ Laughter ] Hey, what you looking at? Not one thing.<eos> Danny is going to be my second at thunder road.<eos> We're going to win this thing!<eos> No, you won't.<eos> What's it to you, Eugene?<eos> Yeah, what do you care who wins?<eos> I don't.<eos> Not particularly. But matters of speed, propulsion, those interest me greatly.<eos> And from my calculations and from looking at the scorpions' superior vehicle, there's no way you boys can win thunder road.
That is without my help.<eos> You guys may be cruel, but you don't know everything.<eos> Why don't you get lost?<eos> Go practice kissing your sister.<eos> Bye, Eugene. Good luck, you're going to need it.<eos> What did you have any mind?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What do we got to lose?<eos> How about our reputation?<eos> Boy, what you guys go through just to be cool.

Before the merriment of commencement commences,<eos> I hope your years with us here at Rydell high have prepared you for the challenges you face.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Among you there may be a future Eleanor Roosevelt or a Lucille ball.<eos> But always you will have the glorious memories of Rydell.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> [Chimes] [ Crying ] Blanche, stop blubbering. Here I go.<eos> I'm over the falls.<eos> How could I flunk phys ed? Step right up it's for a great cause, the teacher's retirement fund and you're the ones that have driven us to it. Three chances to put a pie in the puss coach Calhoun, how could you forfeit the t-birds?<eos> Oh don't worry, you will get your diplomas. - All you boys have to do is come back to summer school.
We can do it together.<eos> Look, I got to go.<eos> I'm behind on my alignment worksheet for auto.<eos> Okay, just don't forget about our appointment after school.<eos> What?<eos> Planned Parenthood, 4:00?<eos> Okay, uh, listen up.<eos> Professor Youens has been unavoidably detained, uhh, so let's review chapter 26 in anticipation for next Friday's test, okay?<eos> Um... that's, uh, differential equations, uh, applied probability, approximation theory, asymptotic and variational methods.<eos> Um... okay, most of you were lost on optimal polynomials on the last quiz, uh, so once you choose the degree and domain of the polynomial, the polynomial is chosen to minimize your worst-case error,
I thought I'd recognised it.<eos> She says it was Russian.<eos> My husband has business in Russia.<eos> Perhaps you know about it, Tatiana.<eos> Well, tonight's not a night for business, eh?<eos> Is that why you were in the concert hall for ten minutes?<eos> I think people are ready for dinner now, Grace.<eos> No, no, I am not done pumping people for money.<eos> What is "pump for money"? It's what I do every day.<eos> You, er...? You know each other, do you?
ADA: He's back.<eos> MICHAEL: Was he out there all night?<eos> Every night since the funeral.<eos> Comes back in the morning to see Charles and feed the horses, and when it gets dark, he goes off again.<eos> He used to sleep out when he was a kid.<eos> Curly would find him in the pasture.<eos> How's the baby?<eos> ADA: He asks for him mum at night.<eos> (CLICKS TONGUE) Tommy made a list.<eos> He wants to see you two first.
The armoured vehicles will be waiting on flatbeds.<eos> - And ammunition?<eos> - The ammunition...<eos> Absolutely delicious.<eos> Ammunition, incendiaries will already have been packed up and crated for transport to Istanbul.<eos> - And how long to London?<eos> - The train won't reach London.<eos> All the goods will be unloaded at a coal yard at St Albans and put onto Shelby Company trucks.<eos> From there, they will go directly to the Poplar Docks.<eos> You Highness, if you're having difficulty understanding his accent, then I can go through the plan with you at a later date.
I brought sandwiches and lemonade I made myself.<eos> I'll make tea and empty ashtrays, but I won't handle money or slips.<eos> Arthur says what you do here is illegal but not immoral.<eos> Depends what time you get here, Linda.<eos> And, anyway, I thought I would offer you my physical and spiritual support for your time of need.<eos> Oh, Linda, if you want to be a help, run up to the shops and get me 20 Senior Service...<eos> - Lizzie'll give you the change.<eos> - No, I won't!<eos> Actually, I'll use my own money, Polly.<eos> And before you ladies decide to find me so amusing, - I have a message for you.
And fetch Michael.<eos> Ada told me he gave you red wine.<eos> I imagine you can't remember half what you talked about.<eos> He was never interested in business.<eos> He came to you at my wedding.<eos> He pursued you, sought you out.<eos> Why would an educated man of his standing do something like that?<eos> You mean, to a woman like me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've done the odds on all of you.
Now I just need your signature for the provenance.<eos> Of course.<eos> I have a pen...<eos> At home, these jewels saw way worse.<eos> That's why they are all cursed.<eos> As are we... Mr Shelby.<eos> If you're ever in Vienna, look me up.<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Before I begin... .. I want you to let you know I made a mistake.<eos> I made a mistake... .. and I want to apologise to all of you.
That's the edge of heaven.<eos> The border between Birmingham and paradise.<eos> And today, my friend, you're going to step over that line, back into the world.<eos> You mean you have something for me to do, Tom?<eos> Have you ever heard of Hampton Court Palace, Johnny?<eos> No.<eos> I can't say I have.<eos> You and three families of the Lees are going to set up camp 100 yards from the gates of the palace.<eos> You won't be moved on because I have just bought the land.<eos> You'll be joined by some old friends of mine who are going to open a hole underneath your tents and caravans.
When you have selected your chosen items, they will be put into a box and stored.<eos> When you have fulfilled your part of the deal, the box will be delivered to you.<eos> May I just start, right, by saying that I may choose to stay here and just starve to death and choke on sapphires rather than ever go back to the fucking world again?<eos> Yeah, well, there is a good reason for that, you know, little man.<eos> Because my shop, right, is just above a rum house, so all the...<eos> - You speak Russian?<eos> - I do, yeah. I do.<eos> Cos of me mum.<eos> Yeah, my mother.<eos> You people, all right, you hunted my mum... with dogs... through the snow.
We're going to pray.<eos> It's our only consolation.<eos> Your aunt took the child as a gift from God.<eos> She will love him as her own.<eos> I know this is a harsh ordeal.<eos> But it can strengthen your faith and your calling.<eos> The diocese still hasn't found anyone to replace the late Father Piasecki.<eos> As for the vows ceremony, I've postponed it twice. I cannot do it again.<eos> The ceremony will be held two months from now.<eos> In the meantime, some of you will be examined by the young woman who is here with the French Red Cross mission.
I'll let the Abbess know.<eos> Run!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Quick!<eos> Run!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Maria, look after them.<eos> You must look after them.<eos> Go on.<eos> You two, that way!
Any idea why?<eos> No idea.<eos> It was all kept very quiet.<eos> - Thanks, Lucius.<eos> - Detectives.<eos> Look!<eos> Penguin pie!<eos> There seems to be some confusion.<eos> My name... is Oswald Cobblepot.<eos> Many of you, no doubt, will have heard of me.
No idea.<eos> It was all kept very quiet.<eos> - Thanks, Lucius.<eos> - Detectives.<eos> Look!<eos> Penguin pie!<eos> There seems to be some confusion.<eos> My name... is Oswald Cobblepot.<eos> Many of you, no doubt, will have heard of me.<eos> Some of you, clearly, have not.
You mean I move on.<eos> I've thought long and hard about this.<eos> No.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> I'm tired of listening.<eos> This isn't fair!<eos> How can you not be with us?<eos> Birthdays... and first steps and skinned knees... and everything.<eos> What, what, visits through bars and-and not knowing when the phone is gonna ring in the middle of the night to tell me when you're...<eos> I don't want that for either of you.
You're sure?<eos> I know he was part of the reason they were killed.<eos> Why is he not under arrest?<eos> It's not so simple, hoss.<eos> The evidence we have is far too tenuous for a warrant.<eos> It's ancient hearsay, not fingerprints.<eos> Only witness is dead.<eos> Barnes wouldn't even say no. He would just look at me like I was nuts.<eos> I'm sick of this.<eos> We know where Strange is, we know he's hurting people right now, and you two are talking about politics with your boss and then getting a piece of paper signed.
It was Galavan.<eos> You sure?<eos> I know it's hard to believe.<eos> But Azrael is Galavan.<eos> Barb.<eos> That's a little irritating.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Babes. - Relax.<eos> No, I...<eos> You guys have been so good to me.
I ain't no captain.<eos> Say something to them.<eos> I don't work here anymore, you do.<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know we're all a bit freaked out right now.<eos> It's understandable, hmm?<eos> Some nutjob in a Halloween costume and cape comes into our house and takes out four of our brothers? !<eos> He does this to our captain? !<eos> Now, I've been around a long time.<eos> It's like the bad guys in this town just keep getting weirder and weirder, but under that mask... is just a man, and he can bleed, just like you and me, and if he bleeds, he can be beaten.
Hugo Strange said that all this time<eos> I've been searching for the man who killed my parents... when really it was my own father.<eos> That he knew what he was doing.<eos> That I am my father's son.<eos> Bruce, your father had the courage to fight for what he believed in.<eos> And as long as there's life, there's hope.<eos> Touching sentiment.<eos> Who are you? Where's Jim Gordon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would urge you to worry about yourselves right now.
I'm a bit stressed.<eos> I don't like being locked up.<eos> It's against my nature.<eos> I understand.<eos> I do.<eos> But you are a priceless scientific miracle.<eos> You are history.<eos> Seclusion is regrettable but inevitable.<eos> Look, I've been here before.<eos> All you mad scientists say the same kind of stuff.
The lab is sealed.<eos> - There must be some way in.<eos> - We have to go!<eos> We have to leave now!<eos> Tell me how to get that bomb and shut it off or I'll batter you to death right here!<eos> In which case, young man, I suppose I will just have to die.<eos> Wait, Nygma knows a way down there.<eos> Could use some help.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two, you've got nine minutes. - Get as far away from here as you can.
Did you finally show him the municipal court website and the pulldown menus you can't click on?<eos> No, I found something we bonded over.<eos> She didn't even know who I was.<eos> And we were good friends.<eos> On more than one occasion, she's called me Gina.<eos> That's her own name.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> We complained about Gina for an hour, and then he opened up... gave me the name of the guy he works for.<eos> I have never been so insulted in my entire life.<eos> I'm not gonna work cases for you guys anymore.
At least I'll die doing what I love:<eos> getting people horny at sea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. That's gross.<eos> All right, here's the plan. We're gonna leave you alone on stage and dangle you as bait.<eos> Damn!<eos> Bait dangling?<eos> If we're up on stage with you, it could spook him.<eos> We'll blend into the crowd, and we'll take him down before he even gets to you.<eos> All right, I'll trust you.
Well...<eos> I'm sorry I was pushing you away.<eos> I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I would love to be all up in your life.<eos> Aw, you...<eos> - Give me a hug.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Mr. Gotaro. You're under arrest for the murder of your tenant Shirley Crouch.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Is this because I didn't rent to you?
- Fraud dog! - Juice Ellen!<eos> - Juice Ellen!<eos> - Fraud dog! Whoa!<eos> Both of you, outside now!<eos> I know it's crowded in there and they're not very considerate guests and they took my mouse and then they took my keyboard and then they took the whole computer.<eos> And when I had nothing else to give, they came for my yogurt.<eos> No, not just any yogurt.<eos> Full fat Greek with a touch of honey.<eos> That's a once a week treat!<eos> What the hell are you guys doing out here?
This must be how the founding fathers felt.<eos> So... what are you doing out here?<eos> Captain, it's mayhem in there.<eos> Those people are messy and selfish.<eos> - And chatty.<eos> - And out here, we can actually get work done.<eos> - But...<eos> - Sir, I'll handle this.<eos> We love it.<eos> We're proud of you.
Hey, Gina!<eos> We got an anonymous gift basket.<eos> Yeah, it's full of treats.<eos> It's got meats, cheeses, candies, all the food groups.<eos> The cheese is amazing.<eos> It melts in my mouth and in my hands.<eos> Hmm, French chocolates, French cheeses, tiny French pickles.<eos> Did none of you detectives think this might be a gift for Captain Holt from someone in France?
Half hour ago... they ate, and then they took off in a hurry.<eos> Half an hour.<eos> They could be anywhere by now.<eos> Nope, there's Scully.<eos> Where's Hitchcock?<eos> I'm taking you guys off your drug case.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Jake said you didn't believe in us.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't believe in you either.
You took them out of their house mouse comfort zone, and now they might get killed.<eos> You really think they're going to kill us?<eos> Oh, no, now I'm starting to panic sweat.<eos> Starting to?<eos> What have you been doing for the past hour?<eos> - Normal sweating.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> If you get killed, what happens to all your debt?<eos> Loophole!<eos> Oh, you sweaty, chair-spinning morons.
Do it, just do it!<eos> - Rosa?<eos> - I'm psyching myself up.<eos> Don't look at them!<eos> Look at me!<eos> Do your job!<eos> Drain me!<eos> There they are!<eos> Everybody give it up for Hitchcock and Scully.<eos> To thank you for all you did, bringing down a drug ring, we have a little present for you:
- Nailed it.<eos> You punching holes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's way too much paper.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Can't even get a cup of coffee.<eos> Well, I'm off to find some yellow paper so I can do this all over again.<eos> All right, Diaz?<eos> That's it.<eos> What's going on with you two?
There's no stupid ideas.<eos> What if we walk around the neighborhood in Captain Holt's clothes, wait till Cheddar picks up the smell?<eos> No, that's insane, never gonna happen.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> - You guys go off the grid.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Go on. I get you guys Mexican passports.<eos> Totally untraceable.<eos> We fake your death in an apartment fire.<eos> I'll need three teeth from both of you.
[whispers] Who's that?<eos> - [whispers] I don't know.<eos> - Um, excuse me, pal. Think you're at my desk. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> Drop the weapon! - Don't be a dum-dum.<eos> - Squad, meet Detective Adrian Pimento. He's been deep undercover for the last 12 years, but he's just resurfaced, and he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.<eos> - That...is... awesome!<eos> [rockmusic]<eos> ♪♪<eos> - Some of you just met Detective Pimento, and, of course, some of you knew him before he went undercover.
It was dripping water on my eyes.<eos> We've been over this.<eos> - You stayed up all night to solve the case.<eos> It just reminded me that I have people in my life who cared about me.<eos> I don't know why I'm spending so much time trying to prove things to people who don't.<eos> - I guess you're a big man in more ways than one. - [chuckling]<eos> - Which I probably should have anticipated, but did not.<eos> - What'd you do, Jake?<eos> - Rats--I did the rats.<eos> I couldn't wait. Enjoy the rats, you rats.
Great, but I specifically said, "co-maid-of-honor," because I am also asking Amy and Gina.<eos> I guess that's okay, if you want to water down your Charles Boyle with a couple of ice cubes.<eos> Count me in as long as I get eight plus-ones.<eos> Guys, focus.<eos> We need to start planning.<eos> So when's the wedding?<eos> Next summer, next fall, next winter? Next week.<eos> - Next what?<eos> - Next week?<eos> That is not enough time to plan a bridal shower, an engagement brunch, a papier-mâché sculpture of you two kissing.
- Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I'd also like to make a toast.<eos> Easy on the dings, man.<eos> One ding'll do.<eos> Thank you guys so much for this party.<eos> It means everything to me.<eos> And I'm sorry that earlier I went a little off the rails, hijacked the bus, stole all of your wallets to double check your identities.<eos> What?<eos> But with friends like you, I'm finally starting to feel like...
That's right!<eos> In your face!<eos> Someone's trying to kill him!<eos> I mean, a man's life is in danger.<eos> Probably shouldn't be so pumped.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> I'm also sorry that someone's trying to kill you, but I can really only take ownership for the first part.<eos> It's okay, Sarge.<eos> I would've doubted me too.<eos> I mean, you guys probably haven't noticed anything, but I've been acting pretty unstable lately.
Ah, how did I not see this coming?<eos> That's what Figgis does to snitches.<eos> Well, game over, guys.<eos> I mean, where are we gonna get a tongue?<eos> Relax, I'm just gonna text Boyle.<eos> He's always eating weird stuff like tongues and chicken faces.<eos> Oh, and he's already texted me back with a top-ten list.<eos> Well, the groomsmen are having a great time.<eos> Jake just texted me about where to get a veal tongue. - Hmm?<eos> - Tonight was amazing, which I didn't think was possible with you guys.
Stupid hospital vending machines didn't have alcohol for some weird reason.<eos> Here. Why not?<eos> I really have embraced my wild side today.<eos> As have I.<eos> Chocolate and nuts.<eos> Actually, that's overkill.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'll wait here, so I can interrogate him when he wakes up.<eos> I'll keep you company.<eos> Why don't you two go home and get some sleep?
He's just a glove-wearing freak with beautiful hands.<eos> Why did he run then?<eos> He's a pickpocket.<eos> I guess the bereft are easy targets.<eos> Also, Scully, here's your wallet back.<eos> How's Amy doing?<eos> Is she paying enough attention to her pelvic floor?<eos> Ignoring that.<eos> She is keeping a low profile, just like we discussed.<eos> I'm really impressed with you two.
You find yourself on the wrong side of him, he likes sherbet lemons.<eos> Sledge fancies himself a bit with the ladies, but if he comes on a bit strong, try and let him down gently.<eos> And get well in with Joyce, she knows everybody and everything and she'll never see you fast.<eos> If you don't understand something, ask me, ask her, ask anybody, but if you get an answer you don't like, don't ask 20 other people, trust your instincts.<eos> In my book, there's two instincts, fight or flight.<eos> And I know which one you've got from the way you refused to leave that cellar without me 18 months since, so have faith in yourself.<eos> You've got your smart book, or your not-so-smart book, as we fondly refer to them.<eos> Good morning, you lucky people.<eos> Got a new PCSO assigned to us today.<eos> This is Ann Gallagher, some of you already know her.
Look, there's blood everywhere!<eos> Take it, jerk!<eos> Shit has really hit the fan!<eos> I can give you 20% tops.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We agreed on 40%.<eos> Don't you have moral principle?<eos> You're paying $2M for $10M's worth of swag?<eos> We used to get 50%!<eos> Now you fences are getting it all!
Say it!<eos> Bro Foon, are you making a comeback?<eos> This time with Cheuk Tze-keung and Kwai Ching-hung.<eos> The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?<eos> Someone has seen you three meeting in China.<eos> Where did you hear this?<eos> Everyone is saying that.<eos> And you believe it?<eos> Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't make money by toting guns?<eos> If I'm Kwai, I don't have to eat lunch boxes with you.
Yip's former boss?<eos> Quincy is Wei's godson.<eos> Want to meet him?<eos> $1M!<eos> You better check him out thoroughly.<eos> Check me out?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> It's just $1M.<eos> Act fast.<eos> Quincy will stand in front of you tomorrow.
Mr Cheuk's life worth at least $100M!<eos> Put your guns down!<eos> Retired soldiers?<eos> Car key.<eos> Car key!<eos> You think I'm bullshitting?<eos> If you don't treat me as your Big Bro, let's split!<eos> Big Bro, we always follow your orders.<eos> You said "drop the guns," we dropped the guns.<eos> Is that very hard for you?
Big Bro, we always follow your orders.<eos> You said "drop the guns," we dropped the guns.<eos> Is that very hard for you?<eos> No, we always follow you, Big Bro.<eos> We support you no matter what!<eos> Are you looking down on me?<eos> I stoop so low that I need your support?<eos> I don't need you!<eos> You're just my followers!<eos> Hey you!
I'll give you another bowl.<eos> - Quick!<eos> - Tell me the room number.<eos> I'll look for it myself.<eos> - I want tea.<eos> - Give me a second.<eos> Sure I'll get you tea.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> We should not forget you.
We can't all be jet-setters.<eos> Who had the turkey provolone?<eos> Oh, Clark, how was that trip to the Norwegian sex change clinic you went to?<eos> - Pow!<eos> Right in the kisser.<eos> - Wow, okay.<eos> The roast beef is mine. Let me get some of the Thai stick you're holding, all right?<eos> Fucking barkeep at Small's shooting me down Wallbangers all fucking night. Oh, good.<eos> Marvin has a hangover.<eos> Least I know one of you has been doing your homework on a school night. - Hey, Rich.
I mean, the man is a serious racist.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I mean... they almost made my stomach turn.<eos> I don't like when we talk about competitors like this because that's not the way we do business.<eos> But let me just say, you're Germans, we're Americans, but we're people.<eos> We're people.<eos> But this man...<eos> - We're all... -... that man is hate.<eos> That's all he is.<eos> Right, and no one knows more about hate than you.

Well, you do seem happy.<eos> Well, Richie and the kids... my heart is full.<eos> Le Jardin next Friday.<eos> You should come.<eos> I should go get things started.<eos> Thank you all for being here.<eos> Thank you for coming out to the mean streets of Greenwich.<eos> We are so thrilled to be here tonight celebrating Richie's birthday.<eos> I don't think he is.<eos> Many of you have actually known Richie longer than I have, but I think we all remember what he was like before he became the reserved, mild-mannered business executive he is today.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were out tonight.<eos> Two nights in a row is not permitted, unless I come with you.<eos> Or I could evict you.<eos> Dad, I told you this morning.<eos> - You were too groggy to pay attention.<eos> - Or too stoned on fart fumes.<eos> Brayden told me you trumped a real humdinger the other day.<eos> He said you cut the world's biggest cheese.<eos> He said his eyes were watering.<eos> I'm joining you at the Horror House tonight.

Good one, Dad.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Very nice, very nice!<eos> Perfect landing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> What an incredible view.<eos> And I mean all of you that I get to look at this fine morning.
None of your business.<eos> We've only got one day in Ohio, so...<eos> - You're selling the company.<eos> - I'll call you back.<eos> You're cutting the books, you're lining up a roadshow, and you got Goldman Sachs camped out in the conference room.<eos> We're taking firebrand public.<eos> - With the CEO in a coma?<eos> - The odds that he recovers...<eos> - When he wakes up...<eos> - If. He is gonna fire every single one of you.
That's what makes this so perfect.<eos> You probably want to hear that I've learned something, that I've changed...<eos> Well, I still think cats are horrible beasts that would eat you in your sleep if they ran out of food.<eos> They're selfish animals. That's for sure.<eos> But I'm not one of them.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Mr. Brand.<eos> You look like a new man.<eos> What can I do for you?
Not anymore.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Mr. Brand.<eos> You look like a new man.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I know we can't replace Fuzzypants, but we were wondering...<eos> If you have any dogs.<eos> No.<eos> But only yesterday, an old friend stopped by.<eos> Used up eight of his lives, and he tells me he'd like to spend his last life with you.
The governor in Nassau hanged a pirate in the square.<eos> The pirate was Charles Vane.<eos> What do you want to do about it?<eos> He knew it was the only way to start it.<eos> Start what?<eos> The resistance in Nassau is now under way.<eos> How long before their force arrives?<eos> A week.<eos> Then we have much preparation to do and little time to do it.<eos> Captain Hornigold will be sailing in consort with you.
Then we have much preparation to do and little time to do it.<eos> Captain Hornigold will be sailing in consort with you.<eos> I know this enemy.<eos> He took that cache with the express purpose of compelling us to commit your force to a battlefield of his choosing.<eos> If you allow him to dictate the terms of battle, you court a disastrous outcome.<eos> You sure this is wise?<eos> At the end of the day, secrets among friends are the source of all good things gone wrong.<eos> Is that what we are now?<eos> Friends?<eos> He wasn't talking about you.
Not now, at any rate.<eos> We're creating the appearance of a man out of nothing.<eos> The appearance of a man that the resistance against the English feels compelled to rally around.<eos> We'll introduce him.<eos> We'll put flesh on him. We'll give him a soul.<eos> But if the street wants to invest him with more than we can on our own,<eos> I won't fight them about it.<eos> But hat name isn't doing anything for us.<eos> We'll have to see about that.<eos> For those of you who have not heard, the governor has imposed martial law upon all of Nassau Town in response to the murder of Captain Throckmorton.
I, uh... I... you... you c...<eos> You can't talk to me like that.<eos> I think history has been tough on men.<eos> I mean, they can't be what they were, and they can't figure out what's next.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> Men?<eos> I think history and men?<eos> I mean who are your heroes nowadays?<eos> A bunch of privileged drug addicts?<eos> I think maybe you guys can help me with Jamie.
Now you sign a deal with a label,<eos> Paid you a big chunk of change to cut an album, So you're feeling like the man,<eos> But they gonna hit that pile of cash,<eos> Pull out a stack to pay for the studio, The guy pushing the button and the cover art And the poster and the launch party.<eos> That's called recoupment.<eos> Cut the record, it sells in stores, shop gets half.<eos> Take out a buck for the manufacturing.<eos> Buck and a half for the distribution.<eos> A buck for marketing.<eos> Not a whole lot left for you.
Not a whole lot left for you.<eos> But even if there is, You don't get to see a dime of it Till they pay off your production costs.<eos> Probably need to sell 100,000 records to do that.<eos> 100,000 is more people than you'll ever meet in your life.<eos> You know the difference between mechanical royalties, Performance royalties, artist royalties, Songwriting royalties?<eos> All that shit's gonna show up on a stack of paper, Your name at the bottom under a dotted line Like it's already done.<eos> And richie finestra's gonna hand you a drink and a pen.<eos> He knows that every single one of those things Is negotiable down to a hundredth of a percent.<eos> I know.<eos> Only ones that don't know is you.
Come on, Jim. Sit up.<eos> There we go.<eos> Harry, commanding officer.<eos> Here.<eos> - Jim, you all right?<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm ugly.<eos> Rosalie, get her out of here.<eos> - All of you.
- Jim, you're fired!<eos> How about this?<eos> There's a study that fatalities brought on by driving while texting have surpassed drunk driving deaths.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ooh, Tinkle likes this.<eos> It's gruesome.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> Well, recently two people in Ohio were texting and they had a head-on collision and died.<eos> What makes it even more horrible and strange is they were texting each other.<eos> Oh, see, you two?
- Hey.<eos> - Nice grip.<eos> So what happened?<eos> You crossed Rudolph Global and they framed you?<eos> Exactly.<eos> I always knew those bastards were against recycled water, and the vote for Proposition 68's in a few days.<eos> Duncan, hey, you have any condoms?<eos> I'll trade you cigarettes.<eos> No, I'm sorry, I don't, Curly. Damn.<eos> What about you boys?
- I don't know.<eos> I didn't read the whole script.<eos> You want me to cancel my trip?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a jerk.<eos> - I just feel like a bad friend.<eos> - Hey, stop talking like that.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> The two of you will go away, have a nice time.
They belong to the Mahayana school.<eos> Do you practice zen?<eos> - No, my ex had a phase.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Well, there is a zendo here.<eos> It's, oh actually, it's a monastery.<eos> Tassajara, but, I'm actually here for a men's retreat at Esalen.<eos> - I know what goes on there?<eos> - You do? What?<eos> - That's where you guys like sit around a fire, and like, bang drums, and thump your chest, and everything, right?
- Uh, yeah, they have really good cookies.<eos> They also have really good dinner.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> Yeah, I'll have to try that.<eos> - Where are you staying?<eos> - This really fancy place, super in the middle of nowhere.<eos> Just opened up.<eos> - Oh, what's it called?<eos> - It's called a tent in the woods.<eos> What about you all?
Yeah, he's a pig.<eos> - Bring it in.<eos> My man.<eos> - Mom, can I get my costume on?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, if you're quick, though.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> - Cool, let's do it.<eos> - Don't give Jesse a hard time.<eos> Okay, red is okay?<eos> - So, how long have the two of you been going out for?
- The black ones?<eos> - Yeah, they're cool.<eos> Tungsten.<eos> I give you good price.<eos> It's kind of goth.<eos> I'd feel like I was marrying Marilyn Manson.<eos> What about these two, with the little diamonds?<eos> Oh, yeah, beautiful.<eos> How much?<eos> Too expensive for you.
You're a clown and looking for a clown?<eos> Pasha, you heard?<eos> Search a clown, you interested?<eos> Hey, Kananga.<eos> Come?<eos> There is the parade!<eos> Afar afraid to children are all capable.<eos> Take my place.<eos> It will give you another ticket!<eos> We will be here for you all Ie evenings at nine on Sunday morning!
We'll work.<eos> We will find costumes, rhythm, acrobatics.<eos> You have nothing to lose.<eos> And the public will decide.<eos> On a big round of applause for the giant Landon!<eos> II Iillipuziano Marval!<eos> II Mr. Snake and Snake Lady with their offspring!<eos> Hercules, the Chaldean which lifts 150 pounds, amazing, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> And finally, Esmeralda, the greatest woman in the world!<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, unusually for you tonight, two clowns at the price of one!
- No, come on, I have to go.<eos> Did not I have to teach me, the èfragile success.<eos> Like all circuses, we are full of debts.<eos> A little 'patience, is a matter of a few months, Ia few weeks and the situation will be clearer.<eos> It is obvious that if I make a full house even in the spring, then we'll talk.<eos> You said I myself last month and even the one before.<eos> But since we're here, you've doubled the takings.<eos> Do not overdo it.<eos> You live better, that's all.<eos> - Especially you.

Yes, as you see.<eos> - And do not you introduce us?<eos> - Chocolat, my partner.<eos> Ortis and Green, the most famous duo of eccentric Paris.<eos> To serve you.<eos> Then "shit!" A lot of shit.<eos> Sunday is never a good audience.<eos> Make calm your gorilla.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> It's up to you.
There!<eos> Now I like more.<eos> So, this scene is Louis Pasteur, who he discovered in 1885 the vaccine against rabies.<eos> Ready for the picture?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, it Chocolat!<eos> Paul, Paul.<eos> Paul, fermo.<eos> - Where Footit?<eos> - There are differences between you?
If you are dry, old, gives way.<eos> This'll just, "old man"?<eos> Hey, it begins to be very ...<eos> - I'll leave the car as collateral.<eos> - Look who is already committed.<eos> Shit!<eos> Lend me some money.<eos> We hope soon to spread the brand Félix Potin in the province.<eos> It was the desire of my father.<eos> And my colleagues have been thinking about you.
- No, look at that ...<eos> - And because I designed it?<eos> It might look like?<eos> It's me?<eos> And my face?<eos> He looks, he acknowledges.<eos> But not me!<eos> We were inspired by Toulouse Lautrec's paintings in which she.<eos> They are the current stereotypes.<eos> The image that people get the ... people like you, people of color.
- Do not talk like that, Marie.<eos> - Then do not behave like this.<eos> Next, again!<eos> "Oh, send me away, my lord, but do not kill me." To you...<eos> You've bitten off more than it can chew.<eos> 11,000 is too much, do not step on it.<eos> You'll have something aside.<eos> The boys will accompany you home<eos> Go to hell.<eos> You, with me.
I think he's negotiating to get you into a nunnery.<eos> If he did, would you rescue me?<eos> No, I'd say thank God and good riddance.<eos> Beast!<eos> Please, Mother, it's embarrassing.<eos> If you don't ask, you don't get.<eos> Prince Vassily!<eos> Prince Vassily.<eos> You know I've never asked you for anything,<eos> I've never reminded you of what my father did for you, but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris.
Prince Vassily.<eos> You know I've never asked you for anything,<eos> I've never reminded you of what my father did for you, but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris.<eos> A word from you to the sovereign would be enough.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> What is it you wish for the boy, Anna Mikhailovna?<eos> Get him a commission in the Guards and recommend him to the General. You know a word from you would do it.<eos> You know, my influence is nothing like what you imagine. But I am seeing the sovereign later this evening.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you.<eos> I know I can trust you.
I thought I'd, uh... come in the back way.<eos> Monsieur Bezukhov.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Pierre, my dear fellow!<eos> We've just been hearing all about you and your dear bear friend.<eos> Oh, please, please don't mention it, I'm so ashamed of myself.<eos> I... I just wanted to come and see Natasha on her name-day.<eos> Surely you should be with your poor father.<eos> Yes, no, I'm on my way there.<eos> I just thought I'd look in on you all first.
- Excuse me.<eos> - Cousins.<eos> - I know, but what can one do?<eos> Look.<eos> You've made her all upset.<eos> Go on, go to her and make her better.<eos> Go on.<eos> Look.<eos> Would you like to kiss me, Boris?<eos> Um, I'm a little old for you, don't you think?
How dare you?<eos> What has this to do with you?<eos> Cousin, why do you stand there?<eos> Help me.<eos> Really. This is ridiculous.<eos> Let go, the pair of you, and give it to me. Now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You leave me all alone with him and now he's gone.<eos> This is your future.<eos> I know you will remember what I did for you this night.
- Go and see what that row is about.<eos> As soon as he is available, I will let him know you are here.<eos> Until then you will have to wait.<eos> - I must see General Kutuzov.<eos> - As soon as he is available, I...<eos> What is it?<eos> - You may give your message to me.<eos> - With respect, are you General Kutuzov?<eos> I am Kutuzov.<eos> Your Grace, you see before you the unfortunate General Mack.
May I ask what has been his advice?<eos> Well, he thinks I should get married.<eos> And so you should.<eos> A man in your exalted position?<eos> The Prince is absolutely right.<eos> The trouble is, though, women don't care for me.<eos> Society women, that is.<eos> I don't seem to have the knack of talking to them.<eos> Believe me, my dear Count, it is not for you to concern yourself.<eos> It is for the young ladies to make themselves pleasing to you now rather than the other way round. As you can see for yourself.

As you can see for yourself.<eos> I will leave you with the Princess Helene.<eos> Such a bore, these things, aren't they?<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> I like to listen and talk about the big things, politics, ideas, the war and how to live and what life really means and so on, but I always seem to say the wrong thing and upset people.<eos> No, you speak from the heart. Of course that frightens people.<eos> Does it frighten you?
Not a bit.<eos> I love it.<eos> Ah, Bolkonsky.<eos> There you are.<eos> We're in trouble.<eos> Napoleon's armies have moved so fast we're in danger of being outflanked.<eos> Prince Bagration's very nobly volunteered to lead a detachment and engage the French in battle, whilst we continue to retreat with the bulk of the army.<eos> Goodbye, General.<eos> God bless you for a great deed.<eos> I thank you for the honour.

But Maria needs me now.<eos> Uh, Principal Welles?<eos> I don't want to make light of the situation, but for my own knowledge, sir, and if you don't feel comfortable saying, please feel free to decline, but do you know who will be replacing you?<eos> Oh, here come the buzzards.<eos> Why don't you just let the man grieve for his dying wife, huh?<eos> Give him that.<eos> Superintendent Haas has yet to make a decision.<eos> Quite frankly, I could give a damn whoever it is.<eos> Just remember one thing, it's all about the students.<eos> It's not about you two.
He laughing it up with them teachers.<eos> Now, how come the teachers never invite you to eat lunch?<eos> They do invite me to eat lunch.<eos> They invite me all the time.<eos> I just, you know, I choose not to eat lunch with them.<eos> They're just a bunch of elitist assholes.<eos> I mean, I'd much rather spend my time befriending, know, the... the lower class workers.<eos> You know, the guys like you and your crew and Harold in maintenance.<eos> I mean, those teachers, they can come and go.<eos> When you guys call out sick, how do the floors get clean?
No, Dayshawn, look, what you do is very important here, okay?<eos> And when I become principal, I'm gonna make sure you finally get the respect you're due.<eos> Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> You're gonna get us a raise?<eos> No, no, it's not gonna be a raise.<eos> I... I'm just gonna make sure that, you know, people don't look down upon you like they do now.<eos> I didn't know anybody was looking down on me, but...<eos> No, well, not everyone.<eos> I mean, I'm not. But you know how students look at you guys, just like, "I would never want to do that job."<eos> But I'm gonna change that image for you guys.
Pants up. If you can get me some more of that money...<eos> Jeremiah, pants up, grades up!<eos> - Like I was saying...<eos> This song is dedicated to Principal Welles.<eos> You're a true hero.<eos> ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ It must have been cold there in my shadow ♪<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> ♪ You're everything ♪ You two, I wanna know what's so damn funny in my office after the assembly. Do you hear me?
Whoa!<eos> - That's kind of harsh.<eos> - Here's what I'm proposing.<eos> I'm gonna file a formal complaint with the school board.<eos> A complaint?<eos> What's it gonna say?<eos> Gonna say they fucked up. They chose the wrong person.<eos> Maybe they need to reconsider things.<eos> Maybe make me principal.<eos> But what I'm gonna need for this to work is all of you guys to sign this complaint with me so they know we mean business.
You know my house burned down.<eos> The whole goddamn thing.<eos> My sons didn't even wanna move here.<eos> Now look. Everything they ever owned, gone.<eos> - I can only imagine...<eos> - Do not interrupt me, Mr. Russell.<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Now, I brought Blythe Sason here to observe this school, and I was expecting him to find unpleasant revelations.<eos> But after reading the report on the two of you, I was shocked.
"Mr. Russell is a great leader "and a great relationship builder.<eos> He is roundly admired by the faculty."<eos> After completing his analysis, Mr. Sason concludes that you two are excellent vice principals.<eos> With everything I'm going through, it's a comfort to know I can trust the men standing beside me.<eos> And I want to thank you for being a bright spot on a rather bleak day.<eos> You're welcome, Dr. Brown.<eos> You may be new here, but you are family<eos> - to Neal and I.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Russell.<eos> And Dr. Brown, if you or your boys need any toiletries or canned goods, I don't mind going to the corner store for you.
I look ridiculous.<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> But you know, it's good to have a look around here.<eos> Boy, do I know it.<eos> This is Ilana.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - I recognize you from Abbi's Instagram.<eos> - That means so much to me, thank you.<eos> - Thank you.
So, we got a picture<eos> - Okay.<eos> - so you can kind of see what it is.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Michelle tracked it down.<eos> Is that his real autograph?<eos> It's an original.<eos> Come on, the suspense is killing me.<eos> It's an original "It's a Wonderful Life" poster with Jimmy Stewart's actual autograph.<eos> You guys are amazing. Aww.
- Gamby, you want a mudslide or what?<eos> No, I don't want a mudslide, that's not even a drink, it's a dessert.<eos> - That's two desserts for you tonight. - It's my cheat day.<eos> Did you need something, Neal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As a matter of fact I did, Mr. Popularity. The students are drunk off their asses and Tammy Wooten and Kyle Gebhart, they're missing.<eos> - Wait, what? - What?<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - Okay, what do we do?<eos> Well, it's come to my attention that you guys don't really want me here.
New fish. The woman you are replacing worked here for 30 years.<eos> Many people loved her, including myself.<eos> You have very big shoes to fill. Are you ready?<eos> Sure.<eos> I think so.<eos> Don't be braggadocios.<eos> It's not attractive.<eos> Grab that ISS folder and follow me.<eos> We're on the move!<eos> Each of you will be required to wear a safety vest while you dispose of the manure.
- Let's get the fuck out of here!<eos> Just get out of here!<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, man!<eos> Boys sure are giving us a run for our money.<eos> Neil! We're only one touchdown behind!<eos> We can do this!<eos> I love you.<eos> Thank you, spirit.<eos> You boys get out of here.
Oh, taco.<eos> Howdy, neighbor.<eos> Oh, Jackie.<eos> Hello.<eos> Herro, Mi-Cha.<eos> Saw you guys walk in when I drove by.<eos> Thought this might be - a good chance for us to chat.<eos> - About what?<eos> Oh, Lee told me you haven't been sleeping so well lately.<eos> Yeah, only when you guys go really late.
I... I didn't mean to piss you off about the whole noise business.<eos> It was... it was just a suggestion.<eos> And... and I understand that the... The cops came out here or something the other night.<eos> Well, Jackie, I... I didn't have anything to do with that.<eos> But here's the thing.<eos> Christine said that you were being a little aggressive with her at the store today. I know.<eos> I'm married to her.<eos> I... Trust me, I know she tends to exaggerate.<eos> You are a real piece of work with your complaints, you know that?<eos> You think I like living next door to you three?
Did I say something?<eos> - C-word. - I didn't say anything.<eos> - C-word.<eos> - You're...<eos> We just need to keep walking and burn some calories.<eos> Come on.<eos> There is nothing that disgusts me more than a female who cheats.<eos> It can be on a husband or on a math test.<eos> It's all equally disgusting to me.<eos> I want each of you to tell me where you think you're gonna be in five years and how cheating on this math test is gonna help you get there.
You want some more popcorn?<eos> Girls, more popcorn? Are you hungry?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Great.<eos> I'll go get it for you.<eos> More popcorn from the popcorn machine.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about this?<eos> Fucking popcorn. You want some popcorn?<eos> There's more for you. There's some for you.
Take all the fucking popcorn you want to eat!<eos> Popcorn!<eos> You think there's popcorn and beanbags in the real world?<eos> There's not.<eos> The real world is full of meanness and shit!<eos> And you girls are just gonna grow up to add to it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I just got my own things going on in my life.<eos> Doesn't have anything to do with you guys.
Well, I can't spend all my time out here,<eos> I'm going back and forth enough as it is. Well, you don't know what it's like here.<eos> It's really hard.<eos> I am here every weekend.<eos> I'm going back and forth.<eos> Yeah, well, I think you should stay with her from here on out. It's the last month.<eos> I can't take a whole month off of work, Lily.<eos> God damn it, you idiot!<eos> Don't yell at her.<eos> No wonder she has high blood pressure, living here with you guys.
So, a.B.C.<eos> Ian's rules<eos> (1) Abc - always be caming always be camming, bitches.<eos> 'Cause the next generation's coming, and they're going to replace you.<eos> Just like you replaced the whores before you.<eos> Stop saying "whores"!<eos> No! I'll say "whores" if I want to say "whores"!<eos> I'll say "whores" if I want.<eos> Now you got me irritated.<eos> And since it's such a slow night, why don't I put one of you sluts to work?

How many times does she have to say she's sorry?<eos> If you want... If you want to, you know, send her a check.<eos> I want to get her a job.<eos> I-I want to get her a decent job.<eos> Yeah, well, it's not gonna be on the farm.<eos> Well, if you talk to Laurie Ann and you could just tell her...<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> Your sister stole money.<eos> She stole money from my dad after he gave her work. She did that to him.<eos> She did that to you.
Let's go.<eos> Come on, get dressed.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Have I been here before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> I feel like I've been here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you go with me?<eos> With you?
Maybe I should've killed Tybalt, too.<eos> Oh, come, Mercutio.<eos> Does every Capulet really deserve to die?<eos> Lord Montague.<eos> Ah, Father.<eos> Romeo.<eos> Late night?<eos> A night with friends is one well spent, indeed.<eos> There's breakfast upstairs.<eos> Enough for you, too, Mercutio.

How disconcerting this must be.<eos> When last you saw my niece, Rosaline, she was your peer.<eos> She is my guest, and a welcome one here at the palace.<eos> I was so sorry to hear of your parents' deaths.<eos> Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> Aren't you even the least bit excited to dance and drink and do as we please?<eos> Not quite as we please.<eos> Unlike you, sweet sister, the idea of finding a husband doesn't actually displease me.<eos> Somewhere out here is my one true love.<eos> What if we meet a man who falls in love with you instead?
That is if your father won't kill me first for taking you to a brothel.<eos> Men who love their wives don't go to brothels.<eos> And just like that, you ruined your life. How?<eos> By marrying the woman I love instead of whoever my father forced on me?<eos> Look what I found.<eos> A pair of Montagues.<eos> Tybalt, we want no trouble with you.<eos> Trouble is all Verona has when the Montagues burn our fields and try and turn themselves into a respectable family.<eos> You think no one remembers that your people came from nothing?<eos> I will not fight you, Tybalt.
I think you are young.<eos> And so is your husband.<eos> In truth, there is only one man I blame for this.<eos> Take this potion, girl, and your body will go cold and still and you will appear to be dead until you wake in the Capulet tomb as if from a pleasant sleep.<eos> Only take one drop.<eos> More than that and you will die.<eos> What dark magic is this, Friar?<eos> It is better, my child, that you do not ask.<eos> Wait with me.<eos> I'll wait with you.
Milan to the west and Venice to the east, and between them, our fair city of Verona... a jewel just waiting to be taken by anyone with an army strong enough to overcome us.<eos> And trust me when I tell you that if we're attacked by the Medici or the Papal States or anyone else, the quarrels of local families will mean absolutely nothing.<eos> We must have peace, no matter the cost.<eos> Escalus, Verona is burning.<eos> You saw them wed? !<eos> Did you not see that Lady Capulet has lost her mind?<eos> We need to leave here.<eos> She told me she plans to make our lives even more miserable than they already are.<eos> Our lives or just yours?<eos> The world believes Romeo and Juliet were a pair of youths caught up in forbidden passion, but now you say they were man and wife, bound by God, with you as their witness?
The grand jury has returned an indictment against Dr. William Brennan for the 1991 murder of his high school girlfriend Amy Meyers.<eos> Do you really think a New York jury is gonna convict a Brennan?<eos> I think New Yorkers know that just because your father was a senator doesn't mean you can get away with murder.<eos> No one wants to get away with anything.<eos> We just want our day in court, which the D.A.'s office has purposefully delayed.<eos> They hoped that if they forced Dr. Brennan to sit in jail for four months that he'd get scared and agree to a plea, which he won't.<eos> Is this politically motivated?<eos> We might agree to the plea.<eos> We have to get him out on bail first.<eos> Now, remember, the D.A.'s gonna say a lot of stuff about you that isn't true.
Okay.<eos> Then we're all good.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Calvin?<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found the murder weapon.<eos> What happened was, um, this train is coming and... it's like... sensory overload and... it feels like, um, switches going on in my brain, flipping on and off, and I pushed her.<eos> And I-I don't mean to, but it happens, and then the lady falls onto the track, and then I went into shock, horror.<eos> Lester, did somebody tell you to push Susannah Fiorita onto the tracks?<eos> You feel like something is entering you.
Ms. Wirth!<eos> Ms. Wirth!<eos> Control your client!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Thanks for the tip today, Nick.<eos> I was wondering how you got it when my best investigator couldn't.<eos> Well, I knew Slater had been in and out of jail when he was young, and...<eos> I happen to know a lot of people in that world.<eos> Which is what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Well, I gave Jerry a chance to redeem himself and had him investigate you.
I was winning in there.<eos> I'm trying to prove my innocence. You don't have to.<eos> It's on Ferretti to prove you're guilty.<eos> My blood isn't gonna match. I can prove that I didn't kill her.<eos> We're going back in there and you are going to apologize to the judge.<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> This is about some evidence that shouldn't be allowed in.<eos> This is about you letting me do my job.<eos> And yes, I'm sure it's difficult to have people doubt you, but please don't put that on me.
This is about you letting me do my job.<eos> And yes, I'm sure it's difficult to have people doubt you, but please don't put that on me.<eos> I am not one of those people.<eos> But you'll become one.<eos> You won't want to, but you will.<eos> Happens to every single person I care about.<eos> It creeps into your thinking.<eos> Billy, I told you...<eos> That this isn't real, I know.<eos> And that I don't have feelings for you, but you're wrong.

What's going on?<eos> I'm recusing myself.<eos> - Albert can take over.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> Albert's right.<eos> I...<eos> I've gotten too close, and it makes me...<eos> - it clouds my judgment. - Sadie...<eos> You need someone who can fight for you.
Sadie, stop!<eos> What happened?<eos> You went to jail when I was two, and robbed me of a mother.<eos> That's what happened.<eos> I met a guy, Mom.<eos> And he's kind and smart and funny.<eos> And he's the first guy that I've ever felt like I could really talk to, and that he might understand my screwed-up life.<eos> But I can't.<eos> It's so complicated, and I don't know what to do, and I need my mother.<eos> I need you.
Rachel, my God! You get younger every time I see you.<eos> Oh, shut up!<eos> Mm, nice.<eos> Always the best for you, darling.
Mm, nice.<eos> Always the best for you, darling.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. I should have told you on the phone when we set up the appointment.<eos> Um, my fee has gone up.<eos> Well, after all this time, you should know you're worth every penny.<eos> - I want to see you.<eos> - Show yourself.<eos> Harold, make yourself known.<eos> Rachel's here.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
It's wicked and sad.<eos> Witchcraft.<eos> That's your thing, right?<eos> Wicca.<eos> Lot of animal sacrifices in that Wicca?<eos> Bundy and Dahmer, Son of Sam...<eos> All of them started out with critters before they killed people, and not a Wiccan in the bunch.<eos> She'd always come in with some Pinterest board.<eos> Stripper trendy was her aesthetic.<eos> Okay, so when she did come in, did she ever confide in you?
- Oh, what?<eos> Oh, I get why Xylda liked this place so much.<eos> You want me to get some salve for your face?<eos> No, I just want to go home.<eos> Of course. Apologies for the little misunderstanding.<eos> This is usually a quiet and peaceful town.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> So you killed Aubrey because you found out the truth about her?<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> 'Cause we know the truth about you.
So you killed Aubrey because you found out the truth about her?<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> 'Cause we know the truth about you.<eos> Where'd you hide the weapons, the money?<eos> They don't belong to you.<eos> Tell me that... maybe you live to see sunrise.<eos> I think you misjudged the situation.<eos> I don't care either way.<eos> I didn't ask for your help, man.<eos> Well, this isn't just about you anymore.
- Can you deal with that?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I need a word.<eos> I'm gonna make you the same offer you gave my friend.<eos> If you tell me who sent you, then you get to live to see the sunrise.<eos> You want a war, old man, you got one.<eos> God forgives. The Sons of Lucifer don't.<eos> My brothers are gonna come through and burn this damn place to the ground.<eos> - It's getting late. - Aah!<eos> No sunrise for you, but a warm dinner for me.
Uh, well, since you came all this way, you want to have a beer?<eos> I guess, yeah.<eos> I gotta admit, this place is nothing like I thought.<eos> Yeah, it's its own thing.<eos> - Makes for good stories, though.<eos> - Stories? - You a writer?<eos> - I write, but no.<eos> I'm not a writer. Someday, I'll go back to school.<eos> Once Connor's out of the house 'cause my dad would be real tough solo.<eos> Yeah, that, uh, can't be easy for you.
Okay, so what did we just sell?<eos> We just sold Paco's Alcohol-Free Tequila.<eos> - Alcohol free booze?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the point?<eos> - Yeah, I know, right?<eos> I like making bad decisions.<eos> All I know is they are paying me to heighten the awareness to the brand.<eos> So, are you going to stay for dinner?<eos> Hmm, let me see - stay and have a nice home cooked meal with you and the kids or go home and listen to Stevie tell me the scientific reasons why the "Walking Dead" could never happen?
Liar.<eos> You really want to talk about lying in this relationship?<eos> Oh, damn, woman.<eos> Why you got to live in the past?<eos> Move on. And you could've told me you was going on a date.<eos> You know what?<eos> This is not easy for me, okay?<eos> I haven't been on a date since 1998.<eos> Who the hell did you go on a date with in 1998?<eos> You, idiot!
Marlon, why are you here?<eos> Because I did some research on the Internet, and I dug up some dirt on your boy Devon over there.<eos> - What did you find out, Marlon?<eos> - Well, I'm glad you asked.<eos> In spite of his pretty face, and those almond-shaped eyes, his Equifax history shows a delinquent payment to the gas company in June of 2003.<eos> What?<eos> It starts with one late payment, then it's a slippery slope from there.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No, there ain't no problem, brother.<eos> Unless you the gas company, and people try to take advantage of you.
I am not in the mood for this.<eos> What is the one thing in this world the kids and I cannot live without?<eos> Me?<eos> You may enter.<eos> What happened tonight, Marlon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I panicked, I guess. Over one date?<eos> You've been on hundreds of dates since we separated.<eos> You don't see me panicking.<eos> That's 'cause you know no matter how many women I date, I'm never gonna find anybody as good as you.

Thank you.<eos> Mellie.<eos> - Be careful. Mm?<eos> Marcus... I see the way he looks at you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> He's not looking at me.<eos> He doesn't look at me.<eos> How does he look at me?<eos> Senator.<eos> He's young, he admires you, he works for you.
Knees together.<eos> Olivia, obviously.<eos> My God.<eos> I want to be absolutely clear.<eos> You're clear.<eos> Graphic and clear.<eos> I've been where you are.<eos> I am aware.<eos> And we don't have time for it.<eos> I am not you or Fitz, so...
So... I'm supposed to serve you?<eos> I'm supposed to allow you to just walk away with a job that I have worked for, I have bled for, I was born for, because why?<eos> You just... you asked nicely?<eos> It's not because you deserve it. It's not because you earned it.<eos> It is certainly not because you are by any stretch of the imagination equipped for it.<eos> You were never a candidate, Cyrus.<eos> Frankie was.<eos> I was.<eos> I still am, not you.<eos> And if you think the only Presidential candidate left in this election is gonna get down on her knees and be a good little girl for you, The man who tried to murder his way into the oval, Honey...
Just say the word.<eos> No.<eos> No, you should ask him out.<eos> I should?<eos> You think?<eos> Sure.<eos> If he says yes, of course.<eos> Charlie, I need that case file.<eos> As fast as I can, Robin.<eos> If you want to take a shot, Good for you.
Is this what you felt with Fitz?<eos> Because if it is I understand.<eos> You should have it.<eos> I should have it.<eos> Everybody should have it!<eos> It's happiness.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Marcus makes me happy.<eos> He loves me.<eos> And I'm happy for you.
I was worried, but it sounds like you have something real with him.<eos> Worried?<eos> Why were you worried?<eos> It's r-really nothing.<eos> People in this town like to talk.<eos> You remember him sleeping with the Mayor's wife.<eos> He cared about her.<eos> Of course.<eos> But also, when I met Marcus, he was a community activist with a Civil-Rights Podcast, and he gave that all up pretty quickly.<eos> Yeah, to come and work for you.

Maybe.<eos> But you can understand why people might look at that and, you know, decide he's a climber, someone who's always looking for the next rung up, someone who may not always be the most loyal.<eos> But as long as he's doing right by you...

You don't get to have both.<eos> You get to be powerful.<eos> You get to change the world.<eos> You don't get to be vulnerable Or weak or compromised in any way by anyone!<eos> I am not going to listen to this.<eos> - You didn't see it.<eos> - You couldn't see it!<eos> So I did what I had to do.<eos> I did my job!<eos> And I made the choice for you.
She was just here.<eos> It hurt this bad when you left Fitz?<eos> Yes.<eos> Liv.<eos> Huck, leave us alone. We're drinking.<eos> I've been going through Jennifer's video footage.<eos> You're gonna want to see this.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> I hate the fact that I ever trusted you!
Might be another revenue stream.<eos> Maybe he should be the one sterilizing everything by hand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll let him know you said that. Wayne, come on, man. Let's prove to everyone that anesthesiologists aren't as lame as everyone thinks.<eos> Spread your wings, brother.<eos> I'll get O'Toole to cover your next two shifts.<eos> My man.<eos> You don't have to be scared.<eos> I'm gonna be sitting right outside.<eos> They're gonna take such good care of you.
Bree.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Oh, I'll let you know when the room stops spinning.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, Dr. Lin.<eos> Uh, actually, Bree, I found you a room for tonight.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> It's really close by, you can stay there for as long as you need to until you feel better.<eos> Why are you doing all this for me?<eos> Because I'm your doctor?<eos> Let me take care of you.
No, you're right, that would be way too weird.<eos> You're not one of those Jason Hodges type of girls anyway.<eos> And what exactly is a Jason Hodges type girl?<eos> You know, like, um... no makeup, effortlessly gorgeous, uh, does well at parties...<eos> You're more of a "no makeup, uh, I don't care what people think about me, I'd rather be at home gaming" type girl.<eos> Thanks, Greg.<eos> ...American State Quarters series.<eos> It's similar to that, but set in the wild as opposed to state-by-state specific.<eos> Oh, he just asked me to change his grade for him, and I said no.<eos> Okay, of course he asked you to change his grade.
Are you really gonna say no?<eos> Fine, yeah.<eos> Yeah, we'll do it.<eos> Well, is that a... a real commitment or is that a Jason Hodges commitment?<eos> How long are you gonna hold that over my head?<eos> It's been over a year now, okay?<eos> I get it.<eos> You're perfect.<eos> You never made a mistake before.<eos> Dated you.
Anyway, when we were at the Mint, I noticed a few things.<eos> Their internal security is ridiculously outdated and anyone could get into their corporate network with just...<eos> I'm not stealing money from anybody, especially not the U.S. government.<eos> Okay, well, if you are looking to save Dennington, your options are kind of limited, legally.<eos> Why do you care so much about this?<eos> I thought you hated me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I kind of know what it's like to have parents who do shitty things.<eos> You...<eos> I saw the way people were looking at you and talking about you just because of what they think your dad did.
Jason, are you doing your homework?<eos> Yeah, don't worry about it.<eos> I watched twelve heist movies.<eos> In three days?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is that we can do this.<eos> What?<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> It's an alarm that I was making for my room, but I was hoping if I handed it to you... you'd start playing with it and I could probably use it to prove a point.
Wait.<eos> You know more about machines than anyone else in this school.<eos> You know that you're the only person getting an A in robotics?<eos> I might've looked at your grades, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, I didn't leave my old school to come get arrested here for some dumb illegal plan the headmaster's kid came up with.<eos> School means too much to me.<eos> I get it.<eos> But you might not have a school to go to if we don't do something about it.<eos> We need you.
Okay. Whoa, hold on.<eos> So, first you cancel on Friday night gaming, and now you're dropping out of lunch lab for some project?<eos> It's not, like, a thing.<eos> We just have a deadline.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I see what it is.<eos> What?<eos> His dad's in jail.<eos> All of a sudden he's got no friends, so where does he turn?<eos> He turns to you for some reason.
He turns to you for some reason.<eos> And you think it's good.<eos> You think, "Cool, Jason Hodges is my friend now."<eos> But next thing you know, you're gonna start smoking marijuana cigarettes and playing cowbell in his band.<eos> Greg, you are so weird.<eos> Relax.<eos> Okay, yeah, but just don't blame me when you find out that he's using you.<eos> Okay?<eos> To him, you're just a computer nerd.<eos> You're just someone he can get a grade change from if he's nice enough to you.
No, that's not what I'm saying.<eos> - I just think that...<eos> - Sure.<eos> If you need a grade, or a schedule change, or to break into a government institution, I'm sure I'll be the first person you call.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I thought you never come to these things.<eos> I, um... kind of figured you'd be here, so...<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> I like talking to you.
Hey, this is nothing.<eos> Please?<eos> She's right.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You sure you don't wanna go with your friends?<eos> I don't...<eos> What, do you want me to say it's okay, so you don't have to feel bad?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No. No, I get it.<eos> You gotta look out for you.
Please?<eos> She's right.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You sure you don't wanna go with your friends?<eos> I don't...<eos> What, do you want me to say it's okay, so you don't have to feel bad?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No. No, I get it.<eos> You gotta look out for you.<eos> None of these people care about you.
The band has split up.<eos> What?<eos> - When were you planning on telling me?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> You never go through with things!<eos> No wonder your band split up!<eos> And, by the way, what about the quarters?<eos> How are we gonna sell them? Have you thought about that?<eos> I'm still working on that part.<eos> I don't know how you expect people to trust you when you haven't even thought things through.
- No!<eos> People are depending on us.<eos> We can't play without a singer.<eos> I mean, we can try to do it karaoke style.<eos> Dakota.<eos> Dakota.<eos> You do know all the songs. No.<eos> I am not singing.<eos> When we were still together, you helped me write practically every single one of them.<eos> There would be no band without you.
Previously on Outsiders...<eos> Was a white boy in here with you?
Drop that!<eos> Drop the knife right now!<eos> Put your hands behind your head.<eos> Tell us what you did with the gun.<eos> What gun?<eos> The one you used to kill Breece Dobbs.<eos> I didn't kill nobody.<eos> Bail is denied.<eos> Found you in the middle of the road.<eos> I've got big plans for you.
Bye.<eos> Hey, um, Yolanda's mother's car is in the shop, and, she's been takin' the bus.<eos> So can I use yours?<eos> Just to get to work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It ain't but 15 minutes from the Mini Mart.<eos> I expect you walkin' back through that door at 5:15.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Hey...<eos> I just worry about you, that's all.
What else do you want me to...<eos> Of course, I want to.<eos> He's my son also.<eos> I get there as often as I can, Stewart.<eos> I'm here doing a job.<eos> It's a good thing one of us has one.<eos> Otherwise there'd be nothing for him at all!<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Wade, come on in.<eos> What can I do for you?
You forgive me?<eos> Did what you had to.<eos> What you thought was right for the clan.<eos> And that's how I know that you are the rightful Bren'in.<eos> One way, leastways, 'cause my boys also told me how you faced them lawmen down, your way.<eos> Better than my way woulda been.<eos> See, bein' Bren'in, the power of it, and the-the desire for it, changes ya.<eos> Changed me.<eos> Changed me for the worse.<eos> Seems like it's changed you for the better.
This change was growin' in me.<eos> Long before I went away. Can we talk? In private?<eos> Stay just outside.<eos> I love you, G'Winveer.<eos> I long have.<eos> And I know that I ain't worthy of you yet, I know that.<eos> But I hope that by admitting' what I done and takin' what comes, I can begin to be.<eos> You'd say anythin' to get what you want. That's what I know.<eos> Then I won't show you by what I say.<eos> I will show you by what I do.
Just $135,000 is the co-pay.<eos> What the... how's anybody supposed to pay that?<eos> - I mean, that's a death sentence.<eos> - Sheriff!<eos> How's it feel to work for a system like that?<eos> Work for a system that kills people?<eos> Might not be pullin' the trigger yourself, you might as well be.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're just doin' your job.<eos> Emelye, I come to you...
What do you see?<eos> That G'Winn.<eos> She's a young one.<eos> In years, maybe.<eos> Old in spirit.<eos> I've seen the looks on some faces when she speaks, and on those same faces when you come back.<eos> There are some don't think she's up to leading'. Think you are.<eos> Well, G'Winn is stronger than she looks.<eos> You can take my word on that.<eos> Strong as you?
If I do a bit of work on it, it'll drive up the value, and, you know, we can pay the whole thing off in installments, cut a few expenses, and, I'm more than willin' to take on a night job.<eos> Maybe I can do somethin' in security.<eos> Wade, listen.<eos> - I'm not gettin' treatment.<eos> - What?<eos> I appreciate all that you are tryin' to do.<eos> I don't care if you appreciate it or not.<eos> You're gettin' treatment. No.<eos> I'm not puttin' myself through it. Or my kids.<eos> It's months of pain and humiliation just so I can die anyway and leave you all in the poorhouse.
I'm not puttin' myself through it. Or my kids.<eos> It's months of pain and humiliation just so I can die anyway and leave you all in the poorhouse.<eos> Do you have any idea what the alternative is?<eos> Do you even know what you're sayin'?<eos> - Do you realize? - Sh-h-h-h!<eos> God has a plan for me.<eos> I've seen it, and he's already showing' me that I'm doin' the right thing.<eos> What about your kids?<eos> He's got a plan for them, too.<eos> And for you.
Don't drive my car!<eos> I'm driving, okay?<eos> Hey, don't you... Don't you...<eos> You don't come back then!<eos> You leave like this, and you don't come back!<eos> Li'l Foster back yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> It's not like him to lose a trail.<eos> If he's not back soonest, we'll look.<eos> But I'm here about you.
If he's not back soonest, we'll look.<eos> But I'm here about you.<eos> You're right.<eos> Banishment's the proper sentence for what you've done, only the mountain already banished you, put you through some kind of hell down there from what you said, and then brought you back.<eos> You know, Lady Ray used to say when you're most sure what the mountain wants, it makes you fools.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> It come to me.<eos> When they came up here, we scared 'em off, but that won't be the last of it.<eos> Now they're buildin' a fence, and I don't know for why.<eos> Somethin's comin', Foster, and I don't trust you.

What are y'all lookin' at?<eos> You even listenin' to me?<eos> C'mere.<eos> Here, you're here.<eos> Looks that way.<eos> I'm glad you're happy to see me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was worried.<eos> Thought you'd be mad at me.<eos> No, I wasn't mad at you.
About how'd you react and... I guess I was hopin' that maybe you'd... be happy.<eos> I... I'm just supposed to be happy?<eos> I'm dealin' with serious matters here. I...<eos> I'm dealin' with... with your people<eos> - attacking' my family.<eos> - My people?<eos> I'm dealin' with Big Foster who's back among us, and he's... he's tickin' away like a time bomb.<eos> And my Bren'in, she's relying' on me.<eos> For the first time in my life, I am necessary here.<eos> I am so sorry that this is an inconvenience for you, 'cause the timin' is just perfect for me.
As a subject to your Bren'in, shouldn't you think a knock to announce yourself would be the least consideration to offer?<eos> I surely agree.<eos> Thing is I sometimes forget that she's my Bren'in, and look on her as my wife.<eos> Thing about bein' an old married couple... you get to be all informal.<eos> You ever married, darlin'?<eos> I've been accused of many crimes in my lifetime.<eos> But keeping' a man from his wife is not amongst them.<eos> I take my leave.<eos> Thank you, Bren'in.<eos> Thank you.
Who's the President of the United States?<eos> I don't know that.<eos> Well, you know, it's probably best that you don't know.<eos> It'll keep your blood pressure down.<eos> But it doesn't look like there's been any permanent damage done.<eos> The next time you want to bang your head against something, try using your pillow.<eos> All right.<eos> While you're here, I'm gonna give you some basic survival advice.<eos> Keep your head down and be very careful who you trust.<eos> And why should I trust you?
So, you come to a decision then?<eos> I suppose I have.<eos> She can stay here tonight.<eos> I'll excuse you from the hunt.<eos> But first thing tomorrow, you take her back down and you tell her your choice.<eos> Don't get all worked up.<eos> Don't go sounding' no alarm.<eos> We'll be in and out in jackrabbit time.<eos> Just goin' to grab us some libations and be on our way.<eos> Here's a little somethin' from us to you.
We're not leaving.<eos> - Coal kills the Earth.<eos> - Ow! You're makin' me look pretty bad, okay?<eos> I don't care what it looks like.<eos> I care what they're doing to our community.<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh. You're takin' her side over ours?<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself!<eos> She's the one that got you the insurance!<eos> She's the one takin' care of you, so come on, let's go!
Where's Hasil?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Li'l Foster?<eos> Just don't know.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Drop it, Farrell.<eos> Do it, now.<eos> I ain't got no quarrel with you.
Say that you're sorry?<eos> 'Cause I wandered on that goddamn mountain by myself for nearly two days and could of got killed?<eos> Or because I could of got killed by one of your crazy-ass cousins?<eos> I didn't mean for it to get...<eos> So what did you mean, Hasil?<eos> 'Cause you sure as hell didn't fight to keep me that time.<eos> You didn't stand up when it mattered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry doesn't get me my job back, Hasil.<eos> I lost that because I was off with you.
Doesn't change anything now.<eos> I'm still gonna get the person that killed Breece.<eos> I don't blame them anymore for Breece's death.<eos> I don't.<eos> I blame that company and that woman.<eos> The minute he started that job, everything went to hell.<eos> Turn off the television.<eos> I'm gonna get the man who did it.<eos> I don't want you goin' back up that mountain.<eos> I need you here... with us.
He's at the bar.<eos> So, I'm gonna go in here for just a minute, all right?<eos> Look, give me two minutes.<eos> Cousin.<eos> Hello, Bren'in.<eos> I was, just out searching' for some ginseng for your coronation batch.<eos> What I need isn't wine, Hasil.<eos> Sure?<eos> Well, if there's anythin'...<eos> I know you love that girl fiercely, but we need you right now.

Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Norfolk Southern run through here or just Tennken?<eos> You catchin' out?<eos> Well, what does it look like, old man?<eos> R.J. Coreman's the only company left in this yard.<eos> Any trains heading' west?<eos> No, sir.<eos> New Orleans tonight. Cincinnati in the morning.<eos> Mind if I join you?
Wouldn't be Christian.<eos> I ain't introduced myself.<eos> Name's Corinne.<eos> What's yourn?<eos> How long I been here?<eos> A day, two, maybe three.<eos> No, best we take a look at you.<eos> Marlon, he's my eldest, he tends the hogs, so he did a real good job... getting that lead out you.<eos> He's a good boy, not like this one here.<eos> No, that's not for you.
I'm a married man.<eos> Hell, I'm married... to a monster.<eos> Now you need some love and tender care. -No.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Where'd you put the goddamn remote?<eos> You probably sat on it.<eos> Did you check up your ass?<eos> It ain't up my ass, bitch.<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> Relax now and let me take care of you.
Hey!<eos> Back off!<eos> Hey, get back!<eos> Put that away, right now!<eos> Hey, calm it down.<eos> Hands off! Calm down.<eos> Stop, listen to me!<eos> Look at me now!<eos> Don't worry about him, okay?<eos> Goddamn it, this ain't about me or you anymore.
- And that is clear.<eos> I mean, you say that you want to solve Breece's murder<eos> - and then it's right here...<eos> - Listen... falls right into your lap, and you say no?<eos> You just toss it out in the garbage?<eos> Hey, what are you talking about?<eos> There's not any evidence.<eos> All we know about this man is he's a Farrell.<eos> What you want, to convict him on the basis of that?<eos> I don't know what to do with you.

Ged badeh, Bren'in.<eos> Shit!<eos> Hell.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah, check.. yeah.<eos> Hey, Gardner.<eos> - Hey, Wade.<eos> - You got a moment to talk?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What can I do you for?
Look what you've done to yourself.<eos> It's a crying shame.<eos> You're not such a big man now, are you?<eos> What if I shot you in the face with your own gun?<eos> You like that?<eos> That's mine, boy!<eos> - I found it! - That's enough.<eos> Shut it!<eos> Took you into my home, bent over backward to make you feel good...<eos> and look at you. You ain't even the least bit thankful for how good I've been to you.

He never was one of us, not really... but he wasn't one of them, neither.<eos> You go outside... and you run as far as you can and don't you never come back.<eos> Okay?<eos> Go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Look, if this is about earlier,<eos> - can we just... - No, it's, something...<eos> I found that in the mail.<eos> Why are they sending that to you?
It was a couple weeks back... and they, took some tests and got the results... and... it's cancer.<eos> It's pancreatic cancer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are they... they...?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> As sure as they can be.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, Wade.<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> There just hasn't been a good time to tell you... or anyone.
Now, Kevin, I am proud of the man that you have become.<eos> And we all know you're gonna go out there and kill all the bad hombres and make us proud.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Carmichael.<eos> You know, I just woke up one morning and felt there was a greater calling for my life.<eos> I decided to join something bigger than myself.<eos> I wake up before the sun rises just to get to work protecting this country from threats you can't even imagine.<eos> You just completed basic training.<eos> You learned how to do sit-ups and make the bed.<eos> I don't expect you to understand the type of responsibility this takes, Jerrod, but you don't have to.<eos> Because there will always be people like me to take care of people like you.
Well, your mama's taking a little time to get used to the dog, but we're gonna have a good time with this dog, I can tell.<eos> Oh, Joe!<eos> You're letting him lick all on your face.<eos> It makes me just want to throw up!<eos> Well, I can't help how the dog choose to show his damn love, Cynthia. - Oh...<eos> - Dad, you know you don't have to keep this dog if you don't want to.<eos> This is what loving your country looks like, Jerrod.<eos> Dad, just admit it.<eos> You're not doing this because you love the troops; you're only doing it to prove a point to me.<eos> This really isn't about you, Jerrod.
Dad, why are you telling me I'm making a mistake?<eos> You didn't tell Kevin he was making a mistake.<eos> Okay, I see.<eos> I know you're looking at Kevin thinking he's a hero, thinking you can be one, too.<eos> But heroes need regular people to save.<eos> Bobby, you are not Kevin, okay?<eos> I don't even like him, but he's built like a soldier and you are built like... someone made for customer service.<eos> I'm not trying to be like Kevin.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> - Because of you.
Mother?<eos> I don't like this, Mother.<eos> Mother?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Norman, it's Sheriff Greene here.<eos> Sheriff, how are you?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'd like you to come down to the station.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I'd just like to talk to you about something.
The tie-in to Jim Blackwell is too huge a coincidence.<eos> Do you have any idea what that reason might be?<eos> No.<eos> No, I... I don't.<eos> I understand there was an altercation at your mother's funeral.<eos> You got into a physical fight, threats were made.<eos> Yes, I just didn't want him there.<eos> Why not?<eos> I felt that he had been bad for my mother and that he was part of the reason she took her own life.<eos> Some people are saying he blamed you for her death.
Well, I'll...<eos> Thanks for letting me know. I'll...<eos> I'll tell her that you have her keys.<eos> Bye.<eos> Got that.<eos> We're good, we're good.<eos> It's hot. It's hot.<eos> Dyl... the water.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Multitasking got the best of you?
Believe me, I know you have options.<eos> I see the way other guys look at you.<eos> You don't think I know I don't deserve you?<eos> I know.<eos> No, Sam.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I just... I miss you.<eos> I miss you too.<eos> Hey, you deserve the world.<eos> I wanna be the guy who gives it to you.
It's a great property, Jeff, great.<eos> Hey, hey, you wanna see what $400,000 in cash feels like?<eos> It's... it's much lighter than you'd imagine.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Wow, like a feather.<eos> Excuse me, I get bad migraines. I have to go. Okay, sorry, sweetheart.<eos> All righty, well, thank you for the ride.<eos> Why did you tell me that I need to talk to Sam?<eos> What could you possibly know about Sam that I don't know?<eos> I met your husband before I ever met you.
Where are you getting your prescriptions?<eos> They haven't called me for a refill in a year and a half.<eos> I just started going to a closer psychiatrist.<eos> It was too far to go to you, but I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I'm just glad you sat down to have coffee with me.<eos> When a patient leaves, you always wonder why.<eos> Was it something I did, something I wasn't seeing?<eos> And I think I pushed you too far too fast, and...
My God, this is insane.<eos> S-so you're saying that Norman hurt my mom? I don't know, Emma.<eos> That's why I never said anything.<eos> Well, you should've told me!<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't have any proof!<eos> Okay?<eos> I-I-I didn't say anything because I didn't... I didn't know, all right?<eos> I... I asked Norma, and... and she said that she couldn't deal, that it would break her, and so I left, all right?<eos> I was a coward, and I left because I wanted to be with you.
No, no, you need...<eos> You need to get out.<eos> You need to leave. You need to go and take a walk because if you stay here, I'm gonna start screaming, and I don't want Kate to hear that.<eos> Sometimes I see Mother when she's not really there.<eos> Sometimes I become her.<eos> Hey, this is a new look for you.<eos> I like it.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're back.<eos> I was worried about you.
Previously on "bates motel"...<eos> Do you think maybe we could be friends?<eos> Of course.<eos> Like, we could hang out sometime?<eos> I mean, even though I'm married?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Well, now you know, chick.<eos> Can you keep this secret about me?<eos> Can I trust you, chick?
Thank you.<eos> Man, you are a life-saver.<eos> I can imagine you go through a lot of these.<eos> Yes, yes, we... we do, actually.<eos> They don't really last too long, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I, um... I was just cl... i've been cleaning out the house, Just trying to get rid of a bunch of old stuff,<eos> This is gonna sound really weird,<eos> But I was just about to donate a bunch of my mother's dresses, And I've got no use for them anymore.<eos> But I just felt bad putting them in the bin, And so I wondered if I could give them to you.
I'll change.<eos> No, no, no, don't change. You... you look wonderful, madeleine.<eos> You just... it just shocked me for a moment.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I just... i tried it on this afternoon, And it felt like second skin.<eos> I really forgot I was wearing it.<eos> It was stupid of me.<eos> No, it wasn't stupid at all.<eos> I gave them to you to wear, And I'm just so pleased you like them.<eos> Here, I got these for you.
Previously on "Bates Motel"....<eos> Your mom stayed at the Motel, and now we can't find her.<eos> So you-you're saying that Norman hurt my mom?<eos> You should have told me!<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't have any proof.<eos> Sometimes I see mother when she's not really there, and sometimes I become her.<eos> Need a room for a few hours.<eos> Marion, you deserve the world.<eos> I want to be the guy who gives it to you.
I forgot that I cleaned up.<eos> You're mad because I left.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Well, except in the British sense of the word, like the mad hatter.<eos> In that way, I am mad.<eos> But the world is full of mad people who function, many of whom are heads of state.<eos> So I think I can manage running a Motel.<eos> What'd you expect, Norman?<eos> You hurt me.<eos> I've done nothing but deny myself and look out for you.
Norman, can you set the potatoes on the table, please?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I made enough food for an army.<eos> I'm making my own dinner.<eos> What?<eos> That's stupid.<eos> It's less stupid than eating pretend food.<eos> Norman, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Come on, you're confused.<eos> Sit down. Let me take care of you.
I'm real!<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> Okay, it's...<eos> It's real, mother!<eos> You're real!<eos> You're real!<eos> I'm sorry, Norman.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm here to take care of you, okay? Not hurt you.
All you could do was watch, watch her get abused.<eos> I don't want to feel this.<eos> You wanted to know the truth?<eos> Well, I don't want to know it anymore... you wanted to understand who I am?<eos> I'm... never mind... I'm sorry.<eos> It's too late, Norman!<eos> It is here!<eos> My God.<eos> There's one thing that stops you from feeling it.<eos> It's what I've always done for you.
- I know, mother.<eos> I do.<eos> - now we just got to finish micro-cleaning the motel room.<eos> Hope I remember where I put the luminol.<eos> what'd I do with it?<eos> - mother.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Should I just turn myself in?<eos> - How can you say that to me?<eos> - Mother, I don't want to be taken away from you or killed or locked up, but what we are doing is wrong.
Yes, i--i do, I think so.<eos> Is--it's over, uh, over that way, huh? Yes, i-i often send the kayakers there during the summer months.<eos> - Well, we found multiple bodies there last night.<eos> - dead bodies?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And one was Jim Blackwell's.<eos> - oh, well, i--i--i don't know what to say, sheriff.<eos> That's--that's truly awful news.<eos> - yes, it is.<eos> I just thought you should know Jim Blackwell won't be bothering you.
There'll be snow there, and there's that beautiful little clearing by the abandoned cabin.<eos> We found it there once when we were collecting foliage on an out-- - yeah, whatever.<eos> Let's just get it done.<eos> - Maybe you should go back down to the motel for a while.<eos> Put up a new shower curtain or something.<eos> - I see.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> sure.<eos> - I'll be back for you as soon as I can.
- Are you still taking the meds?<eos> - no, no, I... Haven't for a while now, actually.<eos> I really don't think that I need them.<eos> The only thing is that I do sometimes miss our mother.<eos> So very much, Dylan. I can't even tell you.<eos> It's just not the same, and it never will be.<eos> - I don't think you're well, Norman.<eos> I don't think you should be living here alone.<eos> - Well, living anywhere else, any other way is not an option.<eos> - look, I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna stay here with you for a few days.
we need to get you some help.<eos> And you need to start taking these again.<eos> You were doing really well on them.<eos> please just take one in front of me so I know you're taking it.<eos> - Please stay out of this, mother.<eos> I just want to talk to him, Norman.<eos> Dylan.<eos> Dylan, I know you mean well.<eos> Because you have always meant well.<eos> And you may not believe me, but I am so proud of you.
I know you still believe that... there... are people who are fighting in this world for good.<eos> But, honey, there is no good.<eos> It's just life.<eos> Which is hard and... and cruel and undeserving of your kind soul.<eos> I know you tried.<eos> I know you did.<eos> You tried so hard for such a long time.<eos> But, hon, you are in a big pickle.<eos> Norman, you are.<eos> And I'm not mad at you, but I just can't let you do any more damage.
You tried so hard for such a long time.<eos> But, hon, you are in a big pickle.<eos> Norman, you are.<eos> And I'm not mad at you, but I just can't let you do any more damage.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's time for me to fix this.<eos> I just don't think that you can fix this, Mother.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not with you here.
- The bare minimum. - Horseshit.<eos> Let's be clear...<eos> Julia.<eos> If we do this, you work for me.<eos> Now, I don't know what he told you, but I'm... guessing it's something about how I must be nuts, how I need to be medicated,<eos> - blah, blah, blah...<eos> - Something to that effect, yes.<eos> But if your plan is to put me in a mental institution, you can walk right out that door.<eos> Okay.<eos> I work for you, Norman.
He called the cops last night and confessed to murdering some local guy.<eos> I don't know, the... the police are at the house and the motel searching for evidence, but...<eos> I just... I think that he's really sick, Emma.<eos> I think he's confused.<eos> This is all so surreal.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> I, I had to hire him a lawyer, and she wasn't cheap, so... I'll... I'll figure something out.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> I'm worried about you.
She hated me the moment she met me.<eos> It's like I smelled bad to her or something. It's weird.<eos> She's so weird.<eos> It's inappropriate.<eos> Yeah, she messed up.<eos> She crossed the line.<eos> And I will make a motion in court to suppress your confession on the grounds that it was made during duress and cognitive impairment.<eos> That's great.<eos> I love that.<eos> But the state still has very strong physical evidence against you, Norman.
I'll check in later.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry about Mom too.<eos> Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> You know, Em, N-Norman's in prison.<eos> It's completely safe here.<eos> I think that maybe, you know, it would help if... if Will brought her up here.<eos> Who would it help?<eos> Me?<eos> You?
Look, I... I had to tell my wife that her mom was dead this morning.<eos> Okay? And that my brother allegedly killed her.<eos> I can't do what you're asking.<eos> Yesterday, you told me your brother belonged in a mental institution.<eos> You said he's not bad, he's just crazy.<eos> And I thought that was really persuasive.<eos> I believed you.<eos> I believe you even now more that I've met Norman.<eos> But, you know, no one's gonna want to see his illness once they see the evidence of his crimes. They need to see his connection to humanity.<eos> And you might not like it right now, but that's you.
Sam Loomis was married to a woman that Norman was infatuated with, Madeleine Loomis.<eos> And Audrey Ellis was the mother-in-law of Norman's brother, Dylan Massett.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Are you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I let Norman into our lives.<eos> That was me.<eos> Sam's a piece of evidence in there because of me.<eos> But Norman only tricked me for a couple weeks.<eos> I mean, how did he trick you for your whole life?
Okay, Alex, look, you loved his mother.<eos> No mother would want that to happen to her son.<eos> She's dead. She doesn't have a say in it.<eos> No, Alex, please, please, listen to me... listen to me.<eos> You've always been a good friend to me.<eos> My family has a cabin in Montana that's abandoned.<eos> No, no... no, we can go there.<eos> We can assume different identities.<eos> I know Norma's death broke you, but I can live with you broken.<eos> I can take care of you.
Okay, Olivia Benson, who is it?<eos> - Jules.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I've been calling you.<eos> - Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> We were just... we were trying to get off the streets fast.<eos> - But you're okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Hey, um, if anything happens tonight, like if, um, if something goes wrong,<eos> I want you to know that I-I really care about you.
- Her stomach hurts.<eos> No it doesn't.<eos> It's her.<eos> It's her stomach.<eos> Well, it's really yours.<eos> I mean, it's like Pompeii with your pants.<eos> - She's joking.<eos> - Vesuvius is your asshole.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> What can I do for you, Barton?
And I-I envy you for that.<eos> And I just... I thought that you should finally know.<eos> I just... I... I couldn't take it anymore.<eos> I was... I was with Tyler, and then I just... I saw Nate on top of me, and I just...<eos> I couldn't keep this secret for one more minute.<eos> You are so brave.<eos> I am super in awe of you right now.<eos> Thanks. Is, um, Harris taken care of?<eos> He is. The plan worked.<eos> This is all about you now, okay?
He would... he... he wouldn't stop.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Nate rape... raped me.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - I wanted to tell you a long time ago, and I was just... I was terrified of this, of standing in your doorway and just shattering everything that you once knew by telling you the truth.<eos> And... and I knew that nothing would ever be the same again. And I just... I wanted to go back to the way things were.<eos> And if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't keep it from you. I was just...<eos> I was scared.<eos> Please just say something.<eos> All I tried to do was talk to you, Jules.
you have to believe me.<eos> You should go.<eos> You made it clear you don't want to be here any more anyway.<eos> Kennedy, I... Kennedy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> _<eos> Harris, it's me.<eos> I got something you need to see.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I stay with you for a while?
Okay, fine. I'll tell the girls.<eos> And, hey, keep an eye on Nate.<eos> Make sure he doesn't do too many shots of tequila.<eos> Yeah, no one wants a repeat performance of the Great Nate Griffin puking into his shoes.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you!<eos> No!<eos> I texted you an hour ago to get up and get ready.<eos> You know what?<eos> No smoothie for you.
It's good to see you.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm okay, I think.<eos> What you did was very brave.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> This is the black-and-white stuff that you're going to need to know... where to report, what the school can do.<eos> Do you have any other questions?<eos> Anything that happens after this is completely up to you.
Sometimes bad situations happen to good people.<eos> Many times, those situations can result in legal ramifications and even jail time.<eos> If this has happened to you...
I wanna earn it.<eos> - What's Sweet Vicious?<eos> - Us, I guess. I mean, Brady started that.<eos> It's really crazy.<eos> A lot of people love it.<eos> Some hate it.<eos> A lot of people hate us, but some love us.<eos> This Nate takedown needs to be special.<eos> We can't just punch him in the dick and deliver a monologue like we usually do.<eos> We need to take away everything that's important to him, just like he did to you.
- This is over!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Can I come in?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> There's no way that you're okay right now.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't do this with you, Jules.
The human body is a beautiful thing.<eos> - Go put on your pants. - Okay.<eos> It's nice to see you on the up and up.<eos> Support group has made a huge difference.<eos> - I feel so much better.<eos> - Yeah? - Have any Zetas been in touch?<eos> - No, but it's fine.<eos> Whatever. I can deal with it.<eos> They remind me of stuff I don't want to remember, so it feels good to start fresh.<eos> Well, I have some fun news for you.
Nate, a mistake is forgetting to get me a birthday present.<eos> You slept with my best friend... and she's saying that you...<eos> She's saying that I what?<eos> She said you raped her.<eos> That's insane.<eos> I would never do that to her or anybody.<eos> You know that.<eos> But do you know Jules?<eos> Uh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> Look, I know how hard this must be for you, but you said it yourself.
I thought you were tailing me.<eos> What if he comes at me while you're scratching your balls on the other side of campus, huh?<eos> By the time I call you and wait for your fat ass to get over here, I could be dead.<eos> I can correct this.<eos> Pizza place.<eos> Tomorrow. 12:30.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Uh, no. Jules doesn't live here any more.<eos> She didn't tell you?
I can correct this.<eos> Pizza place.<eos> Tomorrow. 12:30.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Uh, no. Jules doesn't live here any more.<eos> She didn't tell you?<eos> We're not really talking right now.<eos> Oh. We broke up a few weeks ago.<eos> She didn't tell you?
Did a Sephora explode on your face?<eos> I'm... I'm Brady bait.<eos> I'll pretend to be wasted at the party, and then I'll tell him to meet me upstairs, and then you and I will get changed in the bathroom next to his room, and we'll take him down.<eos> Wait, how do you know there's a bathroom next to his room?<eos> I mean on his floor.<eos> Come on, we don't want to be late.<eos> Oh, I made it just in time.<eos> Um, what... what are you doing here?<eos> What happened to the turtles?<eos> Oh, no, I got another RA to cover for me so I could go with you.
- Yeah. I'll just... I'll tell her how I feel.<eos> With your body on the dance floor.<eos> Or with words in a quiet hallway.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can go to an undergrad party if I'm wingmanning a grand romantic plan.<eos> Wha... I mean, I could just go by myself if I...<eos> No.<eos> You need me for moral support.<eos> I'll sacrifice my night for you, bud, and if I have to party in the process, so be it.

Don't worry.<eos> It's only good things.<eos> Weird.<eos> Hey, you wanna get out of here?<eos> Uh, no, I'm okay.<eos> Why don't you go find someone else?<eos> Hey, are you ready to party-hop?<eos> Oh, yeah, my feet kind of hurt, but you go.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> No. I'm not going anywhere without you.
Let's find you a couch.<eos> Take a picture of me in my toga!<eos> - Coming up.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You certainly wasted no time.<eos> Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, but am I supposed to just wait around until you want me back?<eos> You dumped me, Jules, and I saw you with that frat douche earlier.<eos> I'm just following your lead.<eos> Hey, um, I need to go find Jules.<eos> Oh, no, I'll come with you.
_<eos> Jenny?<eos> - Harris.<eos> - It's going down.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Is this the kind of party you had planned?<eos> Thought you'd get a girl drunk and rape her in your room?<eos> Have you seen Fiona?<eos> No, man. Kennedy just went upstairs to pee.<eos> I'll come check with you.
This darkness that's inside of you is just gonna grow bigger and stronger, and then what?<eos> And what's next, huh?<eos> You beat someone to death?<eos> I wish I could fix you.<eos> I wish I could take away your pain and reverse everything that happened to you, but I can't.<eos> But I can tell you that I'm scared, and I just want you to be better, but I can't be the one that heals you, okay, and for that, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, you want to fix me?<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Poor little rich girl runs to my aid to fix me.<eos> I don't need you, Ophelia.
But I'm not gonna let you ruin my fun.<eos> Help.<eos> There's an emergency.<eos> Lambda Tau. A kid's been beaten up.<eos> Fudge nipples.<eos> Fun night?<eos> I have no idea who that is.<eos> I just passed out.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> So uh, Jules is staying with you?
No.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not, okay?<eos> You deserve to be heard... And you will be heard.<eos> The school can't just hide their heads in the sand.<eos> You're a person.<eos> You're my person.<eos> And we are gonna fight this.<eos> Kennedy Cates doesn't back down from a challenge, and Jules, oh, my God, you are so strong.<eos> I'm gonna be there with you every single step of the way, okay?
Because... ?<eos> Because Harris saw us in Brady's room.<eos> He knows about us.<eos> Is he going to the authorities?<eos> What can we do?<eos> Harris doesn't have it in him to send us to jail.<eos> He just will never, ever talk to me again and hate me forever.<eos> Well, if there's anything I can do, just... please tell me.<eos> And, um, I have news.<eos> Because of you, Kennedy came to find me, and I... reported Nate to the school.
I mean, we looked for Jules, but when we couldn't find her, we just figured she was with one of the brothers, so, uh, we left.<eos> They're our friends.<eos> We didn't know that...<eos> Thank you so much for, uh, coming in and speaking with us.<eos> Uh, your honesty is very much appreciated.<eos> - Thank you so much for coming. - I'm so sorry about the party.<eos> This isn't gonna be easy.<eos> I-I have a lot to tell you.<eos> Oh, my God, me too.<eos> All I've wanted to do for the last month is talk to you.
I just can't stop thinking about it.<eos> Why would she do something like this?<eos> She could ruin Nate's life.<eos> I'd love to get raped by Nate or any CSOs.<eos> Let's just get out of here.<eos> Good to see you, Miles.<eos> You guys sure are talking a lot of shit.<eos> You're worried it's gonna ruin Nate's life?<eos> What about Jules's life?<eos> What if this happened to your best friend or to you, or, no, wait, I forgot, you'd love to get raped.
What if this happened to your best friend or to you, or, no, wait, I forgot, you'd love to get raped.<eos> Why don't you educate yourself before you say something so incredibly heinous?<eos> Come on, Ken.<eos> And... and, Miles, you might want to take a closer look at your best friend.<eos> He's not who you think he is.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's sweet of you to come. What, are you kidding me?<eos> My top three favorite things in life...<eos> The smell of fresh paint, black-and-white cookies, and Title IX hearings.<eos> Hey, we believe in you, Griffin.
Thank you for your testimony.<eos> After a very thorough investigation and examining all the facts, we have determined that you are guilty of sexually assaulting Jules Thomas.<eos> What?<eos> Wait. So, um, that's it?<eos> He's guilty?<eos> I... I don't have to see him anymore?<eos> That's right.<eos> We thank you for your bravery during these proceedings.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am very happy for you, but I am a little surprised.
Thank you for sitting down with me, Jules.<eos> As you know, Title IX proceedings are not legal proceedings, which means that, uh, while the decisions we make are official, we're not always the last word.<eos> I just found out that your case was overturned.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Mr. Griffin's family decided to appeal my verdict.<eos> What?<eos> Who can do that?<eos> People higher up than me.<eos> Sorry, so you're saying that, um... That President Mays, who has never met me, knows nothing about me or what I've been through, has decided that Nate Griffin is innocent.<eos> I imagine this is difficult for you.
Ten grand on homie in red.<eos> Your friend want a taste too?<eos> She's Mormon.<eos> 15 grand.<eos> On white.<eos> Watching two men pummel each other to death just screams your wheelhouse.<eos> Hollow Sky has been alerted to a young man with special abilities.<eos> A compatriot.<eos> Fellow Realm freak.<eos> I hope not quite like you.
Fellow Realm freak.<eos> I hope not quite like you.<eos> Word is, he's powerful.<eos> Turned an MRI machine into the Fourth of July.<eos> Dr. Frost believes he's powerful enough to cross the Bridge.<eos> The Bridge is a myth you all push to keep the bills paid.<eos> Be that as it may, Frost insists on having an audience with this young man.<eos> Frost believes he will help bring Hollow Sky into a new stratosphere.<eos> Your services are required.<eos> This young man can trust you.

Am I dead?<eos> You're far from it.<eos> You're alive in a way few people ever get to experience.<eos> This isn't a dream either, is it?<eos> - No.<eos> Traditionally dream injuries don't hurt like... ow!<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> That thing I did outside, with the wolf and the... and the... if this isn't a dream, how was that even possible?<eos> The reason you were able to do what you did... it's because of this place.<eos> I think it agrees with you.
- Vaguely.<eos> - What about the time...<eos> - Willa!<eos> It's you. Okay? That's what I remember.<eos> No, I don't totally understand it, but, look, I know that we had something.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> Oh! - What happened to you?<eos> - I... I got hit by a car.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It... helped me remember you.
Do you need to say that?<eos> - He's trying.<eos> - Yeah, I heard the song.<eos> It's just... hey, the blood on his jacket... and the running off-stage?<eos> He gets hit by a car and immediately goes off to see some other girl?<eos> I mean, stop me when any of this sounds normal.<eos> No.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That I... I don't think he's ready to live back in the real world.<eos> If there's a family of cannibals in that room, I'm taking back all the nice things I said about you.
We're just figuring out the best recourse... and that means going back in.<eos> In?<eos> As in...<eos> Are you gonna put me in a coma?<eos> No, no.<eos> No coma.<eos> There's another way.<eos> What happened to him, anyway?<eos> Arthur spent years traveling back and forth.<eos> That's when he was with you, teaching you.
CFO of Hollow Sky.<eos> Hollow Sky has been alerted to a young man with special abilities.<eos> Perhaps you'd be interested in making a trade.<eos> We will need to recalibrate our approach, Dr. Frost.<eos> Frost was Arthur's partner?<eos> - You're connected to this machine.<eos> - I can feel it. Holden!<eos> No!<eos> - Holden, no!<eos> - I had you! And then you were gone!
Frost was Arthur's partner?<eos> - You're connected to this machine.<eos> - I can feel it. Holden!<eos> No!<eos> - Holden, no!<eos> - I had you! And then you were gone!<eos> I won't risk that ever again.<eos> Come on. This machine is a death sentence.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
10 bucks?<eos> That's like 80 bucks a day. That's quadruple my allowance.<eos> And go easy on the soda.<eos> It's been 12 years since you've gone to the dentist.<eos> God knows what this stuff does to your enamel.<eos> All this time... you had me believe Frost was the enemy.<eos> That what we were doing was right.<eos> Now...<eos> I don't know what to believe.<eos> I've made sacrifices for you.
Whoa. Okay.<eos> You weren't kidding.<eos> Feel like I should smoke a cigarette or something.<eos> 'Cause that's what they used to do in the old-time movies after they would...<eos> You know, never mind.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You're... you're bleeding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Was it good for you?
I'm Willa.<eos> We emailed about your time working with Arthur.<eos> Um, Dr. Foreman and Dr. Frost.<eos> I volunteered for testing.<eos> The breakup was very ugly.<eos> Arthur repudiated everything.<eos> But the whole idea of using science and technology to reach the afterlife,<eos> Dr. Frost was simply taking Arthur's idea to the next level.<eos> Oh, it was Arthur's idea?<eos> Didn't your grandpa tell you?
We are finished.<eos> And Celeste is gone.<eos> Why can't you see that?<eos> But she'll be on the other side.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> You'll visit her on weekends?<eos> That's not the goal of our research.<eos> You're so blinded by your delusions, you still can't see what's right in front of you.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She needs you.
Yes, yes.<eos> Here's some information I think you'll all find interesting, dare I say, badass.<eos> Lately, we've been getting some complaints from patients about wait times.<eos> Oh, that's not good.<eos> Well, if we stagger our appointments by just five minutes, we could decrease wait time, while still maintaining an excellent level of patient-doctor...<eos> Actually, it sounds like the patients won't get the same amount of time with Dr. B that they've come to expect.<eos> Well, they'd have more time with him, if, if...<eos> Actually, in today's medical industry, it's important we don't sacrifice human interaction just for the sake of expediency.<eos> Actually...<eos> Scott, I've been involved in today's medical industry even longer than you...
And it was kind of an accident.<eos> But that's why you and me, we gotta watch it.<eos> You know, like today, I barely got a word in before el bobo started interrupting me, talking over me.<eos> I couldn't even get my point across.<eos> Well, that's just sexist.<eos> No.<eos> He's not smacking me on the ass and going, "Oye, mamita!"<eos> Oh, that makes me miss your abuelo.<eos> You wanna see real sexism? Be a woman in the Army, okay?<eos> You got a 22-year-old white boy from South Carolina marching behind you going, "Is it hot out here or is it you?"
It's open!<eos> Penelope?<eos> Oh, hello, Lydia.<eos> You look lovely, as always.<eos> I know.<eos> I will let you two talk.<eos> What's up?<eos> Penelope, please, come back to work.<eos> I'm beggin' you.<eos> I can't run the office without you.

"It will not last the night;<eos> "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends... It gives a lovely light!"<eos> Oh, it's just gorgeous.<eos> How lovely, you memorized all four lines.<eos> Well, I've always wanted to meet you, and now I certainly have.<eos> Oh, I don't know what she thought would happen, waltzing around the Algonquin in that fucking frock.<eos> - Girl reeks of antebellum. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Zelda, there you are.<eos> - Here I am.<eos> I need more time with you.
Zelda?<eos> No, no.<eos> Now, this.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Now, Zelda, where would you wear at thing like that?<eos> Well, that's the fun.<eos> you put the gown on, and then you're practically obligated to find an occasion worthy of the thing.<eos> Shall I try it on?<eos> If you'd like.<eos> I'm just afraid that a dress like that would end up wearing you.

No one can see you under a thousand ruffles.<eos> I like ruffles.<eos> And how is this dress any different than the ones I wore in Montgomery when you were telling me how beautiful I was?<eos> We're not in Montgomery any more.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Zelda, this is our time to soar!<eos> We need to put our best foot forward.<eos> You were at the party. You saw how they were dressed.<eos> - We need to ma...<eos> - That Heywood Broun is right about you.
We need to put our best foot forward.<eos> You were at the party. You saw how they were dressed.<eos> - We need to ma...<eos> - That Heywood Broun is right about you.<eos> You're just as phony and juvenile and pretentious as they say.<eos> I know you don't mean that.<eos> Oh, I mean it.<eos> I mean it with all my heart.<eos> You're ashamed of me, Scott Fitzgerald?<eos> Well, I'm ashamed of you.
Mr. Broun.<eos> I think I understand why you became a critic.<eos> You understand everything, I imagine.<eos> I can smell it on your breath.<eos> People like you don't have to sweat and toil to create something for the ages.<eos> Come on, Fitzgerald, let's go.<eos> Yes. Why don't you run along?<eos> No. All you do is you sit around and you wait for a man braver than yourself to attempt greatness, and then you rip him to shreds.<eos> There's no need to take this to a personal place Mr. Fitzgerald.<eos> I reviewed your book, not you.
Thank you, sister.<eos> He must be some kind of a genius or something.<eos> You'll enjoy that.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Delighted.<eos> I have been noodling and hieing my capital eyes on this success of yours, Fitzgerald.<eos> - I'm sure you have. - Yes.<eos> And I have a brilliant idea.<eos> We turn Paradise into a picture show.<eos> Starring you and Zelda.
Any more enbalming fluid, old man?<eos> It's under the bed. Ah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Close the door, Bunny!<eos> I think we should do it.<eos> We have to do something in between all these parties.<eos> I've always loved acting.<eos> And a motion picture is something that we could do together.<eos> Think of how much fun it'll be, goofo.<eos> Well, if it sounds like fun to you, then it sounds like fun to me.
UA Casting Department shared it with him.<eos> He went gangbusters for our girl.<eos> My girl. Oh.<eos> How are we going to celebrate?<eos> On the rocks or on the bed?<eos> I say both. What are we drinking?<eos> First round's on me.<eos> You're stunning, darling.<eos> It just fell into your lap, just like that.<eos> I'm excited for you.
Here we go, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> Come on. Ah!<eos> I've got a name for you.<eos> New name.<eos> Sinclair Lewis.<eos> S-I-N-C...<eos> S-I-N-C-lair Lewis.<eos> Fitzgerald, people came to see the girls...<eos> - Sinclair... - ...not you. Let's go.
I don't know who that is.<eos> Hey, Zelda,<eos> I fear we may have ridden him a little hard tonight.<eos> It seems we hit a nerve.<eos> He never took any of this movie talk seriously.<eos> Townsend's the one who thought I could act.<eos> Townsend's the one who tried to make it happen.<eos> Townsend had his own interests at heart.<eos> Does he think I can't do it without him?<eos> I think it's more the case he doesn't think he can do what he does without you.

You're already selling books.<eos> It's leveled off.<eos> You know, one doesn't stay on top forever.<eos> People really ought to be taught about marriage.<eos> Which of the responsibilities they'll be expected to carry.<eos> I had taken on Scott.<eos> And I was just beginning to understand what that meant.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> This isn't like you, darlin'.
Ah. It's from Professor Gauss.<eos> He was the one professor there that was worth a damn.<eos> He's invited me to speak.<eos> "An acknowledgement and celebration "of your tremendous achievement."<eos> The conquering hero returns.<eos> Or the prodigal son.<eos> I don't know, it's, uh...<eos> The speech, one more thing to write.<eos> Ish kabibble.<eos> All you have to do is talk about how much Princeton means to you.
None?<eos> How could that be?<eos> We sold 100 last week.<eos> You're supposed to order more.<eos> Yes, how can he sign your copies if you don't have any?<eos> President Hibben was upset with the portrayal of the university, and doesn't want it sold on campus.<eos> So why have I come?<eos> Just to be judged and humiliated?<eos> Professor Gauss invited you.<eos> He believes in you.

Indeed.<eos> Professor Gauss, I'm Zelda, Scott's wife.<eos> I'm so honored to meet you.<eos> The pleasure is all mine, my dear.<eos> Congratulations on your tremendous success with the book.<eos> Yes, I hear Hibben doesn't like it.<eos> The president isn't a literary man, is he?<eos> So, what can you expect.<eos> Little to nothing.<eos> Let's go inside. We're ready for you.
- Oh.<eos> - Harvey. We're ready to go home.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No.<eos> Get out.<eos> You're acting like idiots.<eos> Tell me, what have you done besides ride your father's coattails?<eos> I went to war.<eos> You have a spiffy car, and you're never gonna run out of money, and thus, you believe that artists are beneath you.<eos> But I'm not beneath you, Harvey tire and rubber.
It's the natural order of things.<eos> Might be for everyone else.<eos> Zelda, I'm at a loss, sister.<eos> Now call your neighbors in.<eos> Uh, Zelda, I...<eos> I have to hang up the phone.<eos> Henry, get over here.<eos> I told you not to get wet.<eos> Out of the water.<eos> No dessert for you.
Could you perhaps knock?<eos> Come in.<eos> Goofo, I'm losing my mind.<eos> The house, the work of it.<eos> I hate cooking.<eos> Is this really what we wanted?<eos> Let's go into the city.<eos> Haven't we just left?<eos> That was ages ago.<eos> - It was a week. - Maybe for you in here, but not for me.
These are my thoughts and dreams.<eos> You told me you thought my writing was beautiful.<eos> I'm sorry I interrupted your process.<eos> Well, for your information, I have written three stories already, but I have to do both.<eos> Max wants the new novel by September, and he's not going to give me another advance.<eos> So without the stories, how do we afford this house?<eos> How do we afford anything?<eos> You think that that just appeared on your wrist by magic?<eos> I don't want this, you horse's ass.<eos> I want you!
Japanese what?<eos> Tildy said you needed a few things, some sheets, some towels.<eos> Oh, yes, thank you, Mama.<eos> - Uh, Scott.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Would you take Mama and the bags upstairs.<eos> Oh, certainly.<eos> Tana, can you show Mrs. Sayre up to the guest room.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> I asked you.
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...<eos> So, how's it feel to be sleeping with a model?<eos> I really was into you, but now my feelings changed.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - I'm saying... we're over.<eos> - I couldn't do all of this without you.
- I'm here to help.<eos> Let me do something.<eos> I'll be like Mr. Mom!<eos> Rebecca, I'm an idiot.<eos> I realize now that all this time it's been you.<eos> You've always been there for me.<eos> Do you want to go somewhere and talk?<eos> - I don't know if I can just leave.<eos> - What?<eos> You could've sailed right out that door with Josh, but you didn't... instead you were here for me when I needed you.
_<eos> I-I'm really sorry, Alex, uh, just feeling kind of flu-y.<eos> So I can't make my shift.<eos> Sorry, bro.<eos> Bye.<eos> I feel kind of bad about missing work, but... today is going to be your first time at Raging Waters,<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> True confesh time.<eos> - Uh-huh. - I have been dreaming about going to Raging Waters with you ever since you told me about it that day at camp.
Okay, wait.<eos> True confesh time.<eos> - Uh-huh. - I have been dreaming about going to Raging Waters with you ever since you told me about it that day at camp.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I remember it was on July 25, 2005, because that was the day my aunt died, and you were trying to take my mind off things.<eos> So you were telling me about the park and all the fun slides and the unlimited churros.<eos> I may have exaggerated about the churros.<eos> You have to pay for them.<eos> I get that.<eos> But I'm just so excited to go with you and hold your hand on the lazy river.
It's the only place I can get a steak that isn't stuffed with cheese.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, quit bothering me and go back to Board Shorts McGee and his family.<eos> You know what?<eos> His name is Josh Freaking Chan, okay?<eos> It's not Board Shorts McGee. It's not Flip Flop, it's not Water Cooler.<eos> And frankly, you're a little obsessed with Josh Chan.<eos> Yeah, it's, like, weird and unhealthy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hundo for you if you slip some American cheese singles into his steak.
I-I can't believe I yelled at you in front of them and then I left.<eos> I owe them such an apology.<eos> That goes without saying.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey...<eos> So, um, what do you want to do?<eos> You want to get in our pj's and cuddle or do you want to just go straight to bed?<eos> - Go to bed.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Hey, um, how about I chase you and you run... like I'm pretending to be really mad at you.

I don't know, I might say it again later.<eos> Seriously, where are you going?<eos> We are going to a family bar mitzvah.<eos> So, he is going to meet the entire Garfinkel clan.<eos> That's my mom's side of the family.<eos> It will be wonderful.<eos> All right. If you say so.<eos> I do say so, because he is the man of my dreams.<eos> You know you say that a lot?<eos> I've never heard anyone else use the term "man of my dreams" before you.
It's a family event; that's a big step. Yeah.<eos> Almost as big as when you announced your relationship status on Waze, which I didn't even know was a thing.<eos> Well, when it feels this great, you want everyone to know.<eos> Everyone?<eos> Thank you for texting me back.<eos> I, um, used up my data plan sending you sad Bitmojis and Golden Girls GIFs.<eos> JIFs?<eos> Is it GIFs or JIF... Never mind.<eos> It's not your job to tell me.<eos> Yeah, uh, I had to take a few days once I heard about you and Josh.
I'm sorry, are you talking to me now?<eos> - I'm so confused. - No.<eos> You're confused?<eos> I've been confused ever since this one popped out of my vagina.<eos> Oh, my God, Mom, do not talk about your vagina. Why?<eos> It's perfectly good.<eos> I have had some fabulous reviews lately.<eos> Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, stop it! - Oh...<eos> - All right, listen up,<eos> I'm on a grapefruit diet, but for you, I put some whitefish salad in the refrigerator.
It's something called epigenetics;<eos> look it up.<eos> Hey, don't be condescending.<eos> You think you're the only person who reads Tablet Magazine on Twitter?<eos> Rebecca, a people is not responsible for your life, you are.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I hate it here, I hate all this stuff.<eos> Ah, well, this stuff, this town, these people...<eos> They're you.
That's where that's from.<eos> I'm gonna bury that again.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Done.<eos> Ha!<eos> Hey, you know what? You're doing really well, Nathaniel.<eos> No, I see how hard you work, how talented you are, how little food you eat.<eos> You're a very disciplined young man, and you don't need your dad to tell you that.<eos> You have to know that for yourself.<eos> I've been kind of a jerk to you, Darryl.
Look at my ring, guys!<eos> (squeals happily) I have a ring!<eos> A ring!<eos> See? Uh, see?<eos> Uh, see?<eos> Uh, see?<eos> It's a priceless family heirloom.<eos> He didn't buy you a ring?<eos> Yeah, he did buy it for me; he bought it back from the pawn shop that I sold it to, which is so sweet, 'cause he knew how much it meant to me.<eos> Well, I mean, if it meant that much to you, you probably wouldn't have pawned it.
Maybe because making a permanent commitment to someone is not to be taken lightly.<eos> Wow, so this is our thing now;<eos> you just say insulting things in a calm voice, and I'm supposed to take it.<eos> Awesome.<eos> To be fair, Mrs. H, Josh and Rebecca have known each other since they were 16, and they've been through a lot this last year, so...<eos> Thank you, Matron of Honor.<eos> See, that's how you read a room.<eos> Don't condescend to me, little girl.<eos> (mocking gibberish) Listen, guys, I know it seems like the proposal came very quickly, but we haven't even set a date yet.<eos> Good for you.
Shackled to one person for eternity.<eos> So boring.<eos> The pursuit is the fun.<eos> We're hunters by nature.<eos> When I'm chasing a client, I'm on them 24/7.<eos> But once I sign them, it's like,<eos> (chuckles) "Quit calling me all the time.<eos> Nobody likes a needy whore."<eos> Who wants to talk budgets?<eos> This must be such a romantic time for you and Josh.
Darryl, have you been eavesdropping again?<eos> Because we talked about that.<eos> I wasn't eavesdropping.<eos> I was actually listening actively from afar.<eos> - Wh... - Because I care!<eos> Look, Paula,<eos> I also experienced a humiliating infidelity.<eos> I don't...<eos> And I know what it feels like to know that your spouse's genitals are taking a little stroll around the block.<eos> But I can be a good sounding board for you.
You're gonna stir before you put in the creamer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I like to saturate the wood.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Goose bumps.<eos> - Hey, Darryl?<eos> - Hmm? I was thinking.<eos> I know sometimes I get impatient with you, and I'm sorry about that.
Hello!<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Power must have gone out due to the winds.<eos> There's no cell phone service in here.<eos> The alarm's busted, too.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> How are we gonna get out of here?<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> - I am calm. I just can't be stuck in here, and I cannot be stuck in here with you.

- And...<eos> - I-I totally understand.<eos> - I'm ready to do the work.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I missed you.<eos> I've missed you, too.<eos> And that toilet upstairs has been running for three weeks, and it is driving me insane.<eos> So you are gonna have to...<eos> put your hand in that tank ASAP.<eos> Honey, I will put my hand in an unflushed toilet bowl for you.
Will you accept the charges?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Marcus.<eos> How are you, darling?<eos> How is your gang?<eos> Oh, before you say anything,<eos> I'm so sorry that I haven't been able to visit.<eos> I-I've been so busy with Long John Slither's...<eos> Well, of course I still care about you.

So what was that, uh, comment under your breath just a minute ago?<eos> Dude.<eos> I love Josh, but those are the last two people who should be getting married to anyone, possibly ever.<eos> I don't know, just not big into marriage in general, you know that.<eos> No. I don't know that.<eos> That's not a thing that I know.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah, no. It's just not my thing.<eos> Most people end up getting divorced. I mean, you got divorced.
You know, every time you call him Daddy,<eos> I get this... (coughs) barfy ball of phlegm in the back of my throat.<eos> Okay. Just... Can you please?<eos> It's my rehearsal dinner.<eos> Right.<eos> Planned by your fiance's ex-girlfriend.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> VALENCIA: I am so good at my job.<eos> Head coordinator for assistant coordinator.<eos> Um, I'm right next to you.
It sounds like fun, right?<eos> I would love to, Rebecca.<eos> Thank you for asking.<eos> Great.<eos> Paula!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - He said yes!<eos> - (gasps) Yay!<eos> - Yay!<eos> - That's good for you!
- Yay!<eos> - That's good for you!<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> - What're you doing here?<eos> - What? Hey, Rebecca.<eos> You're looking lovely-ish.<eos> Your father invited me.<eos> I did give him a private plane ride, remember?<eos> I do, and thank you for that.<eos> I'm so glad I did that nice thing for you.
He disappears from your life, you only hear from him sporadically and now he wants money from you?<eos> I'm very glad you called me.<eos> Look, Rebecca.<eos> Maybe some good can come from this.<eos> Maybe now you can see that your father's behavior in the past has set a pattern for you, seeking the love of men who don't fully love you back, men you have to pursue, men who are taken or emotionally unavailable,<eos> like your father, like Josh, like Greg, like other men, I'm sure.<eos> (exhales) Oh, Robert.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You know how much I care about you.
Rebecca loved him.<eos> And then he got those lumps that dogs sometimes get, and (clacks tongue) curtains.<eos> Makes her upset.<eos> Okay.<eos> But what does that have to do with Harvard Law School?<eos> What has gotten into you today?<eos> I just...<eos> Josh,<eos> Rebecca does not need this right now.<eos> She's madly in love with you.
We should get rolling.<eos> You know how it is getting to the beach.<eos> Two hours, four hours in traffic, six hours in the rain.<eos> What's happening with your torso, man?<eos> That is some seriously mopey massaging.<eos> I just have a lot on my mind.<eos> - I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay, I-I can't actually talk to you while your... chest is twerking, so would you mind stopping that?
Thanks.<eos> What's up, Josh?<eos> I have questions about Rebecca, and I don't know if they're real questions - or I have the jitters.<eos> - Okay. Well, maybe you should talk to Rebecca.<eos> No. She'd be upset.<eos> She's so happy.<eos> Yeah, but, Josh, if you have problems, she's the one you're gonna want to face them with, right?<eos> She's the one you chose.<eos> - But I don't want to hurt her.<eos> - You know, I'm proud of you, Josh.
I just know it.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, calm down.<eos> That envelope was given to you by her crazy ex-boyfriend.<eos> Stop freaking out.<eos> Just go to Rebecca, talk to her, and get married.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay, silly.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> God, you're so calming.<eos> I-I feel like if I could just stay here, in this gym, with you, all my problems would magically be fixed.
The-the thing that I do.<eos> Sara, I-I have to go.<eos> Can you stop being pretty for a second?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Ugh. (squeals) Remember that night, at Beans' party?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You swore you would help me find my way to Josh.<eos> You believed in it then even more than I did.<eos> (chuckles) Oh, I used to think you and Josh were written in the stars, and... all right, you know, then I realized that was... more for me than you.

Uh, there's been a very, very slight delay.<eos> HEATHER:<eos> But don't worry. Father Brah is talking to Josh, so it should all be just fine.<eos> What?<eos> WHITE JOSH: Something's wrong.<eos> I have a bad feeling.<eos> And I have a great feeling.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, watching you and Madison together, I had a big breakthrough.
Dad, I don't... I don't think a dog's a great idea, considering her condition.<eos> You know, you got to... take it out, feed it, remember that you have it.<eos> Joe, I'm confused all the time and I'm scared, scared of what's coming.<eos> I'm losing who I am.<eos> But, Ma, you used to be so active.<eos> You had all those hobbies.<eos> Oh, I didn't like that stuff, I just wanted to get out the house to keep your father from beating me.<eos> Trust me, every woman in a pottery class is crying out for help.<eos> Mom, maybe you could move up to North Carolina with us.<eos> We'll take care of you, make you feel comfortable, cook for you, help you get to your-your appointments.
Joe, I got to make this decision while I still can.<eos> The other day, I was staring at a photo of me hugging some woman I didn't even recognize.<eos> I had to read the inscription on the back to find out that that woman was my best friend for 40 years.<eos> Grandma, that's the saddest thing I ever heard.<eos> Oh, don't feel sad for me.<eos> I had a good life.<eos> Especially growing up a poor black woman who lived through Jim Crow.<eos> I mean, just not being raped or killed by the Klan, I'd say I did all right for myself.<eos> That's the saddest thing I ever heard.<eos> But I need you, Grandma.
I know this is hard. I know it's really, really tough, but a lot of families have to go through making a decision to pull the plug.<eos> Yeah, but this is not no pull-the-plug situation.<eos> This is pulling the plug out the wall and strangling her with the cord.<eos> Okay, here they are, your favorites, my snickerdoodle cookies.<eos> Okay, let's start talking game plan for how we gonna kill me.<eos> Wait...<eos> There is no game plan because this isn't happening.<eos> I'm in this all by myself?<eos> No, Grandma, you're not.<eos> I'm with you.
She's determined to do this, you know.<eos> Sh-She'll just find another way.<eos> She'll jump off a bridge or walk in front of a truck or sit in a car...<eos> I got it.<eos> You were right about something, okay?<eos> I am a little removed.<eos> It is harder to lose a mother than it is a grandmother.<eos> But maybe, maybe that's what you need right now, Dad... someone who can be a little objective.<eos> All right?<eos> And what I see is a woman who is determined to do this with or without you.
I mean, all I got is this 20.<eos> Inflation.<eos> Man, you'll get that back in a minute.<eos> Grandma, there's...<eos> I don't know, there's so much I want to say to you right now, I don't know where to begin, I mean, last words are tough.<eos> I really want to make sure I say the right thing to you.<eos> Now, baby, don't put too much on this.<eos> We've had a lot of great times over the years.<eos> And there's nothing we need to say now that we haven't said already.<eos> We just want to make this special for you.
I mean, these candies just keep getting darker and darker.<eos> - We love you, Mom. - Yeah.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> We love you, Grandma.<eos> Yeah, I love you, Grandma.<eos> Is she gone?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> No, I'm still here.<eos> I thought I was going out, but I guess not.<eos> Well, well, can we get you anything?
Now, this is gonna be your grandma's death song.<eos> Every time I hear it, I'm gonna think of her.<eos> "All About That Bass"?<eos> Your grandma was all about that bass.<eos> About that bass.<eos> No treble at all.<eos> Dad, Dad, you're going 85 miles per hour.<eos> Your grandma was 85.<eos> I will now only drive 85 in the memory of your grandma.<eos> This is for you, Mama!
Well, look, I got to sit down.<eos> Do you know how scary it is to get a text that say your baby brother is caught in a mall shooting?<eos> Probably not as scary as being caught in that mall shooting.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Those bullets missed you, but that text message went straight through my heart.<eos> I can't believe this is real. Jerrod, tell me what happened.<eos> Uh, I heard gunshots, I hid behind a kiosk, and other people started running and I ran, too.<eos> I know it sounds scary, but I'm fine, I'm safe.<eos> God, this is crazy.<eos> Okay, well, let me, let me take care of you.
Look, man, when I got the news, I was really nervous.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I took three Vicodin.<eos> Bobby, where are you getting this Vicodin?<eos> Okay, let's not get overly<eos> My baby!<eos> - dramatic. Oh, my God.<eos> The Angel of Death tried to take my son, but my God said "Not today"!<eos> Your life was spared.<eos> Oh, the blessings of Abraham are upon you.
Well, know, Jerrod, that I am your mother and I love you more than any of these people.<eos> Well, I don't know, Mama.<eos> Jerrod is getting a lot of love on Instagram.<eos> Damn it, Bobby, you posted this?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Near-death experiences... get you the most likes on social media.<eos> Look, I know being a victim is real sexy right now, all right?<eos> But I don't want to be one of those guys who posts every sad thing about them on Instagram just to see how many people care.<eos> Ninety-three.<eos> 93 people care about you, Jerrod.
We all need to be haunted a little bit. It builds character.<eos> That's what makes you a man.<eos> I had an abusive, alcoholic father.<eos> That haunts me every night.<eos> That's my thing.<eos> Now you got this, and it's your thing.<eos> Hey, Daddy, can this be my thing, too?<eos> Hey, Bobby, Bobby.<eos> It's your brother's thing.<eos> Now, some massive tragedy's gonna strike you soon enough.
Now you got this, and it's your thing.<eos> Hey, Daddy, can this be my thing, too?<eos> Hey, Bobby, Bobby.<eos> It's your brother's thing.<eos> Now, some massive tragedy's gonna strike you soon enough.<eos> Just be patient.<eos> That's why I coddled you boys so, because I didn't want you to end up haunted like your father.<eos> Sometimes, at night, when I look out the window, he's just out there, sitting on the lawn, looking up at the moon.<eos> Joe, you know, if you ever need to talk to someone, I'm here.<eos> Why would I talk to you when I got the moon?
Is that true?<eos> If you guys won't leave, then I guess I will.<eos> Congratulations on kicking a man out of his own apartment, especially on a day when all he really needed was to be alone.<eos> I don't know where he going; the moon don't come out till 7:42.<eos> Jerrod.<eos> Look, I know that this isn't easy, but... you need to deal with this.<eos> I am. I'm trying to get this stain out.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> It's okay to open up.<eos> I'm here for you, whatever you need.
Well, you'd be surprised. New York is a small city.<eos> Is it?<eos> You know, at times like this, people want to support you and-and make sure that you're okay, but it's important that you know you are not a victim.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much, Monica. I've been trying to tell my family that all day,<eos> - but no one will listen.<eos> - No, you're not a victim.<eos> You're a survivor, like me.<eos> Stay strong.<eos> You know, take care of you.
You know, take care of you.<eos> Take care of your mind.<eos> Take care of your spirit.<eos> Take care of the earth.<eos> Take care of the...<eos> Ah, see, I'm forgetting something.<eos> Did I say spirit?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There you are, Jerrod.<eos> There's a cop upstairs looking for you.
The Carmichael Show is recorded in front of a live studio audience.<eos> Me first, Mama.<eos> Now, after years of trying and failing and trying again,<eos> I finally found you the perfect birthday gift.
Man, Niecy's don't even have a doorman.<eos> Mm, last time I was at Niecy's, they didn't have a door.<eos> Any place where the employees look happy makes me suspicious.<eos> Well, I want to see the bathroom. I bet they have granite countertops and those paper towels that are more towels than paper.<eos> Baby, grab some of those for the house, please. Okay, baby.<eos> I will.<eos> Yo! - Look at this guy.<eos> - What up, man?<eos> Hey, thanks so much for getting us in here, my man.<eos> Hey, anything for you, my nigga. You know that.
Of course they made it in-house.<eos> Look at the cartoonish amount of steam rising off the backs of them rolls.<eos> God, I'm hungry.<eos> You know, Dad, if you want a roll, you could just take a roll.<eos> Oh, what a dilemma.<eos> This must be what it felt like to sit at that Woolworth's counter in the '60s.<eos> - I'm just gonna...<eos> - Joe.<eos> have a bite, 'cause, you know, my blood sugar's low. Mmm.<eos> This is for you, Greensboro Four.
Like, we don't care about mixed race anymore, but we do care about mixed league.<eos> These days, when it comes to looks, you expected to stick with your own kind.<eos> That's true.<eos> The other day, I saw a white guy, like, making out with a black dude, and the only thing that stood out about them?<eos> One of those dudes was way hotter than the other one.<eos> Well, which one?<eos> Was it the black one?<eos> I hope it was the black one.<eos> So you mean to tell me people are gonna be judging me if I bring Maxine's friend to this wedding?<eos> Son, I already think less of you for even considering it.

Nekeisha!<eos> Ooh. Todd, you must work really hard for those.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Could I get you an energy drink?<eos> Um, some lemon meringue pie?<eos> We got lemon meringue pie?<eos> No, but I can make some.<eos> Actually, we about to go have sex.<eos> Um, Bobby...<eos> I'm not gonna leave a sock on the door like I normally do, 'cause I'm telling you in person, right now. Okay?
Look, l-let's face it, your life would be completely different if you weren't attractive.<eos> I mean, we wouldn't be together.<eos> You would have never gotten that low interest rate on your car.<eos> - We probably...<eos> - We wouldn't be together?<eos> What, Maxine?<eos> I mean, I didn't notice your intellect and ambition from across the room.<eos> Okay, so you're dating me - because of what I look like?<eos> - No, no.<eos> No. I started dating you 'cause of what you look like.

Maxine, you look like a disciple.<eos> I told my entire extended family how hot you are. Okay?<eos> I said you were a nine and a half, emphatically.<eos> You're gonna make me look like a liar.<eos> I bet my Uncle Pete $200.<eos> Jerrod, this isn't about you. I'm very serious about this.<eos> I don't want to be judged on my appearance anymore.<eos> And, if I'm gonna be meeting your entire family, I really want it to be all about connection and conversation.<eos> Okay, Maxine.<eos> I've never said this to you and I feel really vulnerable saying it, okay?
Am I a monster?<eos> Yeah, a little bit.<eos> But, you're a beautiful monster.<eos> I just really wanted to believe that the world wasn't so superficial.<eos> Look, Maxine, I really respect what you were trying to do.<eos> Okay?<eos> And, for what it's worth,<eos> I do value who you are as a person way more than I do your looks.<eos> So much so, that... if you got in some sort of disfiguring car accident, I wouldn't leave you.<eos> But, if you got some type of brain injury, and you were as hot as you are now, I'd have sex with you one last time, then I'd get out of there.
Fuck.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Fred.<eos> Fred.<eos> Where are you, fucker?<eos> There you are.<eos> There you go, buddy.<eos> Fred!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Morning to you, too.
I'm concerned about these circles under your eyes, okay?<eos> I think you're working too hard with all these different jobs you got going.<eos> Well, if I wanna go to college, I've gotta earn money to pay for it, right?<eos> My baby, the college boy.<eos> But it can't be all work and no play, honey.<eos> Young person has to have some kind of social life.<eos> I've got friends.<eos> Who?<eos> The lesbian?<eos> Or that boss who's nothing but mean to you?
- We'll get you underground.<eos> - What?<eos> They're gonna come for you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They won't blame me for your bad choices. Of course they will.<eos> It's what they do.<eos> Nolan won't let them.<eos> Stop deluding yourself.<eos> That man threw away his wife.<eos> You really think he's gonna stand up for you?
I'm staying here.<eos> Okay.<eos> You need to break her.<eos> Quickly.<eos> I can help.<eos> Give me five minutes alone with her.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> But first, you need to look me in the eyes and swear that this is real.<eos> That you feel the same way about me that I feel about you.
What'd you tell them?<eos> That I hadn't seen you since...<eos> We ran?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm scared, Katie.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Where?<eos> We'll come to you.
Where's Alex?<eos> I want to get these announcements made.<eos> We're not exactly on the same schedule these days, Dawn, and... nice bunnies.<eos> I don't think you're allowed to comment on my bunnies now that we're not married.<eos> Hey, there she is.<eos> At least, I think that's her.<eos> Sorry. Sorry, I'm late.<eos> I was just...<eos> Had a little problem with the kickstand.<eos> Remind me not to park near you.
- Good. - Is there anything I can do? - No.<eos> Want to go for a beer sometime?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Medicine, 4-8.<eos> Hey, looks like we're working together today.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - After you.
Ah, I got that.<eos> And truth be told, shrews are actually kind of amazing.<eos> They have an excellent sense of hearing. They procreate almost continuously,<eos> - which is nice for them.<eos> - Dr. Bell, you're needed in the E.R.<eos> - Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> Shall we hop to it?<eos> Sure.<eos> It'll be so awkward.<eos> How is working with Charlie more awkward for you right now?
Look, okay.<eos> Have you ever felt like you woke up in someone else's body, living someone else's life?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's called having a moment, and it's completely normal after a major breakup.<eos> So that's a yes?<eos> Tag me in.<eos> Great. Patient's name is Todd Groaner. He fell off his horse.<eos> There's no internal bleeding, but his abdomen is swollen, so check in on him periodically, make sure the swelling has gone down.<eos> Bye.<eos> Do I need to worry about you?
Can't you just take care of me here?<eos> I'm sorry. We can't.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is Dr. Alex Reid.<eos> I'm with a 16-year-old girl.<eos> Stab wound to the lower abdomen.<eos> I need an ambulance to 1551 Ossington right away.<eos> Back alley.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> We're gonna take good care of you, all right?
The words you're looking for are "I'm sorry."<eos> Oh, dude, I already said that.<eos> No.<eos> You didn't... ever.<eos> Not back then. Not now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe 'cause I'm not.<eos> No, no.<eos> Hear me out, hear me out.<eos> Look, Dev I know that was a crappy time for you, but what happened back then, it turned me around.
Boring! - Away!<eos> - Who wrote this?<eos> - Come away with me, my love.<eos> - Aaghhh!<eos> Rhythm!<eos> Damn you, Richard! Rhythm!<eos> Rhythm!<eos> - Your son is ruining my play!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I'll bloody ruin you!
Search the theatres for a writer with a gash on his hand.<eos> "Tamburlaine the Ghost" by Christopher Marlowe!<eos> Burbage!<eos> Where is that liar?<eos> Burbage!<eos> Burbage!<eos> You said it was my play.<eos> Well...<eos> I did pay for a Marlowe play.<eos> But I didn't write you one.
- Should I have just, um...<eos> - Oh, no, no no, no, it's okay.<eos> I know that you're still like catching up on everything.<eos> - So what's up?<eos> I just wanted to see what you were up to.<eos> I'm just coming back from class.<eos> Cool, that's cool.<eos> Well, I was just, um...<eos> I wanted to see if maybe you'd want to do something.<eos> I would love to do something with you, Holden.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I'm just here to talk to Holden, all right?<eos> Listen, I thought I made it pretty clear what would happen<eos> - the next time you came near my family.<eos> - Look, I'm not here - to fight you.<eos> - Then just keep on driving, Jeff.<eos> - Hey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Jeff was just leaving.<eos> - I have to talk to you, all right?
Dad, look, it's okay.<eos> Just go, it's okay.<eos> He just wants to apologize.<eos> Hey, you need to come with me...<eos> - Jeff...<eos> - or Kevin's as good as dead.<eos> This guy in the yellow jacket, he's a professional.<eos> My brother didn't even have a chance.<eos> Hey!<eos> Didn't you say he came after you, held a gun to my brother's head?
Just go, it's okay.<eos> He just wants to apologize.<eos> Hey, you need to come with me...<eos> - Jeff...<eos> - or Kevin's as good as dead.<eos> This guy in the yellow jacket, he's a professional.<eos> My brother didn't even have a chance.<eos> Hey!<eos> Didn't you say he came after you, held a gun to my brother's head?<eos> If he's willing to go that far, do you really think he's gonna leave you and your family alone?
You're right.<eos> So what are you in the mood for?<eos> Something... orange.<eos> Something orange coming right up.<eos> Get down.<eos> - That's him.<eos> - I know.<eos> All right, let's move.<eos> Matthews!<eos> Look, I need you.
Mr. Jones?<eos> Please, call me David.<eos> Apparently, I forgot my wallet at the grocery store and David found it.<eos> Most people would have tossed it.<eos> My mother didn't raise me that way, Diane.<eos> - Oh, excuse me for a moment.<eos> Holden, will you entertain our guest until I get back?<eos> Your mom's a lovely woman.<eos> You really are blessed.<eos> She told me all about you, about your brother, Luke, - at college.
Oh, hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, did Dad finally run off because of how you treat him?<eos> No, he's in the car.<eos> I cracked a window, he's fine.<eos> Listen I'm going back to school.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> - I'm gonna study television production, and the admissions lady said<eos> I could get credit for an internship.<eos> Oh, good for you, Mom.
- Why?<eos> It's my dream.<eos> If you have a dream, you must go after it, not next year, not next week, now.<eos> Now, Carol!<eos> Amen!<eos> What?<eos> No, Father Kevin was talking to me.<eos> And since when has it been your dream to work in the news?<eos> Since always!<eos> But then I met your father and quit my job to raise you. M'kay.
You know what?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Coffee run on me.<eos> Mom, why didn't you answer your phone?<eos> I don't have to.<eos> You're not my boss anymore.<eos> Okay, Chuck says he needs to talk to you.<eos> Oh, so you only came here because you need my help.<eos> No, no. I'm very sorry that I tried to get you fired, okay?<eos> I gave up everything for you, and now I just want a little dream for myself and you won't let me have it.
Look at this shrine.<eos> You were the smartest kid, and a track star.<eos> And you were amazing in "Les Mis" as Dock Whore.<eos> Mom, do you remember how I got on the track team?<eos> I didn't make it and then you went to the coach and you forced him to let me on.<eos> You have always interfered.<eos> I can never do anything on my own!<eos> And then what happened next?<eos> Who won these trophies?<eos> I got you on the team, but I didn't run the race for you, did I, dum-dum?
It's real zazzy, yeah.<eos> Um, listen, Mom,<eos> I think you should come back and be our intern.<eos> I don't know, Katie.<eos> Having me around is a big sacrifice.<eos> I can't do that to you.<eos> I've already given you genes for hairy arms and scoliosis.<eos> It's not a sacrifice, Mom.<eos> You make me believe in myself.<eos> And I-I need you.
Hey, Mom, I gotta go, I'm at work now.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> - Oh, hi. - Hi, Mom.<eos> - Yeah, hey.<eos> It's not real Starbucks.<eos> Daddy gave me one of those Sofia Vergara coffee machines so I make it in that and then I put it in old Starbucks cups.<eos> That's money in my pocket.<eos> You ready for your first full day as an intern?<eos> Ooh, yes, Katie, it's gonna be so much fun.<eos> Like when I went to all of third grade with you.
- And going to school.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I was supposed to do yesterday, damn it!<eos> Morning, everyone.<eos> Who has segment pitches?<eos> Oh, before we begin, I'd like to say a few words.<eos> Ooh, actually, interns aren't allowed in this meeting.<eos> I just want to say how excited I am to be here.<eos> And I want to thank Greg for hiring me, and, oh, Portia for that great interaction on the elevator this morning.<eos> And thank you, Carol, for your interesting take on the Black Lives Matter movement.
Thank you for ruining the show and dropping a steamer on my journalistic integrity!<eos> News is not the place for small talk and personal opinions.<eos> That's the problem with journalism today.<eos> It's more about the personality saying the news than the news itself!<eos> A real newsman has no personality.<eos> Walter Cronkite said one thing at the end of his show.<eos> "And that's the way it is." Not, "I feel meh today."<eos> Or, uh, "Mm, I like breakfast for dinner."<eos> I, for one, will not be betraying the news.<eos> I'm not a Benedict Arnold like you!
Because I am not just your co-worker,<eos> I'm your mommy.<eos> It never changes.<eos> You helicopter-parent me so hard that I end up getting burned in a fiery helicopter-parent crash.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just keeping you safe. Like I've always kept you safe.<eos> You kept me in a gilded cage.<eos> Oh, please, that was one time.<eos> You're holding me back, just like you did when I was a kid and you wouldn't let me go to summer camp.<eos> Because I waited all school year to hang out with you.
There hasn't been a single moment I've regretted my choice of SIO.<eos> Think very carefully, please, Michael.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But I've stuck my neck out.<eos> Plenty would have taken you off this case by now.<eos> There wasn't a young woman there?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have every confidence in you.
But two or three, leaving no clues for months?<eos> According to his medical records, he was diagnosed with learning difficulties when he was 11.<eos> That doesn't necessarily mean he was incapable of committing the offences.<eos> True, but he was meant to have stolen the car used to abduct Hana Reznikova. I'm not even convinced he can drive.<eos> His solicitor bring that up?<eos> Don't even get me started on the solicitor.<eos> You pressed Huntley on the driving?<eos> I know how to run an undercover.<eos> Never said you didn't.<eos> Well, we could leave it to you, but I don't want us to all end up in court again.
I've got better antennae than that.<eos> You know we can't be micromanagers, Ted.<eos> We trust our officers... .. to conduct themselves with professionalism and integrity.<eos> Sorry.<eos> ACC Hilton.<eos> Steve.<eos> How do you know when an executive officer's telling lies?<eos> His lips move.<eos> There may be something in this.<eos> I sincerely hope not, but I'm relying on you and Kate to get to the bottom of it.
You had the choice to talk to me.<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Oh, don't give me that.<eos> You made some half-hearted effort to discuss a couple of minor anomalies in the evidence recovered<eos> - from Michael Farmer's house.<eos> - They're hardly minor.<eos> Cases of this complexity create mountains of evidence. It takes the experience of a good SIO to cut through all that and recognise the truth.<eos> The evidence is the truth!<eos> You think Michael Farmer's innocent, I know that he is guilty.<eos> There's a pattern of institutional blindness, led by you, into the possibility of another suspect.
I found a more modern version for us to dance to.<eos> Oh, I kinda like this one.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It's about, uh, how you look away for a second and you turn back and... your little girl's all grown up.<eos> It's actually getting to me.<eos> Papi, I want to tell you something.<eos> That I'm the greatest dancer you've ever seen?<eos> I know.<eos> That, and... I have grown up.<eos> And I've learned a lot about myself since you've been gone.
Just give us a sec.<eos> Are you indulging whatever this is?<eos> Uh, you mean supporting our daughter? Yeah, I am.<eos> No.<eos> She's not...<eos> She's not that way, okay?<eos> I've been gone a year. What the hell's been going on here?<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I didn't know she was gonna tell you, but now that she did, you're gonna have to figure out a way to be okay with it.
And I know you love her.<eos> And you know how much it means to Elena for you to be at her quinces.<eos> Does the whole family know?<eos> No.<eos> She's only told a few people.<eos> All right. Well, that's good.<eos> Don't tell anyone else.<eos> - I'm not gonna tell anyone else.<eos> - Good. Because it's not up to me.<eos> Or you.
Cristina was pregnant with Baby Juanito for 11 months, and she still thinks he was premature.<eos> I don't know if we can fit in any more tables.<eos> We are not adding another table.<eos> I can make this work.<eos> I don't feel safe.<eos> Gracias, estoy bien.<eos> Dr. Berkowitz, would you mind helping me pick this up?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> It would be a pleasure. I feel like we dodged a bullet there.<eos> Don't drag me down with you, buddy.
Is it the morning?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What?<eos> Did I die?<eos> Is this heaven?<eos> Open up, it's Schneider.<eos> Oh, God, it's hell.<eos> I got one last pickup.<eos> What is going on?<eos> The Cubans are missing, my seating chart is gone and I'm kind of attracted to you?
You're just gonna let this happen?<eos> Will you just drop it?<eos> You know, one day, either you or Hudson-- you're gonna need something, and I'd hate to find ourselves up the creek because we cashed in all our chips here.<eos> Look.<eos> I'll do whatever I can to help Bram.<eos> Just know that whatever I do, they can use it to question our loyalty, and right now, we have so many big things in the works.<eos> Your initiation ceremony tomorrow.<eos> Everybody's gonna see that you're being welcomed into the circle, and I don't want to blow that.<eos> Look. I know you love your family.<eos> It's one of the things I love about you.
Come on.<eos> Keep coming.<eos> Weapons in the box.<eos> Come on.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> Yeah. You stabbed me.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Hey.<eos> Devon's got something for you.
I lost him during the Arrival.<eos> That's a sad story.<eos> I heard he might be running in one of your gangs.<eos> Well, he's a good looking boy.<eos> But I meet a lot of people.<eos> I've got a transit pass.<eos> Then show me.<eos> You know, what's to stop me from just killing you and keeping the pass?<eos> Because it'd be bad for business.<eos> People come to you knowing that you'll make a fair trade.
So I'd like to hear a little goddamn gratitude.<eos> And then maybe we can make a deal.<eos> If I get to see my boy,<eos> I'd be grateful to you for the rest of my life.<eos> Dino, where's Charlie?<eos> In the alley, near 28th.<eos> In the alley near 28th.<eos> Hey.<eos> A little word to the wise-- the street changes a kid.<eos> So don't blame him if he doesn't want to go with you.
What else did he do to you?<eos> I came to take you home, Charlie.<eos> You're never going back to that place--<eos> Solomon told me I had to go back or he'll hurt me.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> I won't let him.<eos> - He'll hurt my friends.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> I won't let anything happen to your friends.<eos> - Then he'll hurt you!
If it was an ambush, I'd be wearing a mask.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I-<eos> - I wanted to talk to you about Bram.<eos> I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about his situation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wondered if there was anything else that you can do for him.<eos> - Maddie didn't talk to you?<eos> - She did. I just-<eos> - I thought maybe if I spoke with you directly--
One of my guys saw him steal it from the docks.<eos> You're willing to go to the Factory for a screwdriver?<eos> Let's go.<eos> How dare you?<eos> What?<eos> You went behind my back to Nolan.<eos> No, Maddie.<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> It was-- it wasn't like that.<eos> What if I did something like that to you and Will?
Do you not trust me?<eos> Or do you just not understand boundaries?<eos> I deserve an answer.<eos> Maybe I didn't believe that you would push Nolan hard enough.<eos> Nolan can protect us because he knows how to play the game.<eos> - He is gonna help Bram--<eos> - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - He just has to be smart--<eos> - It's a game to Nolan.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake, Katie, this isn't about you!
How's that working out for you?<eos> This.<eos> This is why you're alone.<eos> I- - I'm gonna send Gracie back down to you.<eos> You are about to enter a select group.<eos> The question for humanity is not where we have been. It's where we are going.<eos> Are you prepared to accept that truth?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Will you safeguard the secrets of our movement, even from friends and family?<eos> And do you accept that the punishment for violating you oaths will fall not just upon you, but upon everyone you love?

Will basically admitted it, you know, before he went through the Wall or whatever the hell he did.<eos> Drink that.<eos> What is it with you and Will and the whiskey?<eos> Why can't you drink something that doesn't taste like lighter fluid?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Broussard.<eos> I have no contact with him. I don't believe you.<eos> But it's true.<eos> And if I try and reach out to him, he will know that I've been compromised.<eos> And it's gonna fall on you.
Broussard.<eos> I have no contact with him. I don't believe you.<eos> But it's true.<eos> And if I try and reach out to him, he will know that I've been compromised.<eos> And it's gonna fall on you.<eos> I've made mistakes.<eos> God knows.<eos> Right now, I just want to be a mother to the one child I have left.<eos> I know that you and Will were friends.<eos> I know he trusted you.
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Ooh... Someone is in trouble.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You can't sue us!<eos> It was our idea!<eos> Grace, you said you were gonna sue me, but I never heard from you.<eos> What's a guy got to do to get your attention? You're suing me so you can see me?<eos> I'm being proactive, one of the things you like about me.<eos> There is nothing I like about you.
- Just to help Jacob get settled.<eos> And that way it'll give me a chance to see if I like it.<eos> So moving there is still a possibility?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Well, I don't know, maybe this isn't, you know, a very good time.<eos> Because...?<eos> Because, moving and uprooting your whole life right now, after what's just happened?<eos> Could be really good for me?<eos> Frankie, if something were to happen, you'd be all alone.<eos> Don't you want to be with people who love you?
Because I can't get you out of my head.<eos> Then you should get a new head.<eos> I would, but I have great hair.<eos> I mean, do you spend every moment worrying about your health?<eos> Is it something everyone else does that I should have been doing?<eos> - I don't think everybody...<eos> - Because it's exhausting.<eos> Or maybe I have Epstein-Barr now, too.<eos> My brother-in-law is a heart surgeon.<eos> I know it's not exactly the right specialist, but he said he'd be happy to talk to you about your health worries anytime.
- Yeah! The cops are on their way and you're all going to jail, because they love my bagels.<eos> Not for long they don't.<eos> The best bagels in town are baked by a bigot!<eos> The best bagels in town are baked by a bigot!<eos> Now... this was a tough one.<eos> It's a replica of The Pequod, but I call it The Mariah Carey because it was top heavy and impossible.<eos> It's great, Dad.<eos> Mack will love it.<eos> I'm just thrilled to have another model-ship enthusiast in the family!<eos> You know, I always had hopes for you or Brianna, but you had your dolls and she had that bizarre dance club she built for spiders.
Now we can date.<eos> I originally come from Connecticut. I have two siblings.<eos> I'm a Scorpio.<eos> Now you go.<eos> - I... like booze. - Oh.<eos> No, no. We did not negotiate pre-late lunch drinks.<eos> You're right. I'll just have to pour out this extremely dry martini with olives flown in this morning all the way from Spain.<eos> That would be disrespectful to Spaniards everywhere.<eos> How do you know what I drink?<eos> Because I did a little research on you.
You're ballsy, beautiful, and don't suffer fools.<eos> I'm suffering right now.<eos> See there?<eos> I love that.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I just want you to give me a shot.<eos> Oh, come... I could be your moth...<eos> Older... I could be your older sister.<eos> Why is it so hard for you to believe I like you?<eos> That I might even want to have a relationship with you?

- Boom, check it out.<eos> - Wow. - Yeah. You're really passionate about San Diego tourism.<eos> We're so blessed to live in such a beautiful city.<eos> - We really are.<eos> - Jesus Christ, Sol.<eos> - All right, let's move them out of here.<eos> Not without me.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't let you do it alone, Sol.<eos> Or you, Peter. Or Paul.

Or Paul.<eos> Or even you, Steve.<eos> I was wrong, Sol.<eos> This is the right thing to do. I want to be the kind of man who does the right thing.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Oh, I can't go anywhere.<eos> It's time to do my blood pressure.<eos> No, put down the cuff, put on your moccasins, and come with me.<eos> - Grace...<eos> - No, stop talking.<eos> This is important.<eos> Are you going to push me off a cliff?<eos> - Because that would be funny only to you.
Oh, you can't go.<eos> You hate balloons. Yeah, I hate balloons, I hate baskets, I hate fields,<eos> I hate pulling you.<eos> God, why are you so strong?<eos> I'm not strong, I'm weak and falling apart.<eos> Frankie, get in the basket.<eos> You told me I can't go to Santa Fe, how could I go up in a balloon?<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Okay? And I feel terrible.<eos> I should not have put my fear on you.
All right.<eos> How's your father?<eos> Pats, what did the letter say?<eos> I haven't had the chance to read it.<eos> - Then read it now.<eos> - I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Besides, if I ignore it, then it might all go away.<eos> Why do you always make light of everything?<eos> I know what the letter will say -- "Come home."<eos> And that will mean leaving you.
I'll make us coffee, and while I do, I'd like you to look through these.<eos> A little light reading.<eos> We recommend it for all our mothers-to-be.<eos> But... Nurse Mount, you made it sound as if I shouldn't hope.<eos> We can offer no promises, nothing to outweigh those with greater knowledge, but at this moment, you are an expectant mother.<eos> I think in all my talk of duty, perhaps I forgot to speak of joy.<eos> I keep thinking how much worse this could have been.<eos> You're such a catastrophist!<eos> But you're also a doctor, and you know what it's like when help is needed -- you just jump in.<eos> He would have got even more involved than you, Mum!
- Mr Marsh, please.<eos> - He's just over there.<eos> George!<eos> Jessie?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here, love.<eos> I'm here.<eos> We got a son.<eos> Bobby.<eos> He's the spit of you already.
Your eyes must be given the chance to heal.<eos> George, we got a baby boy.<eos> Just think of him.<eos> Without me sight, I've got nothing.<eos> Still can't get your plaster wet, Mum?<eos> I believe the authorities look unfavourably on child labour.<eos> Oh, didn't I say?<eos> I'm a slow healer.<eos> I've been thinking -- if the baby's another girl, I might move out.<eos> I might come with you.
They want George to speak up at court for Arthur.<eos> Oh, well, that could spur him on, don't you think?<eos> I can't say, Mum.<eos> They was always close, him and Arthur.<eos> He gets so tired.<eos> We're still early days, ain't we?<eos> I wish I could bring something in for you.<eos> I feel I'm just making it harder.<eos> None of that talk now.<eos> We couldn't manage without you.
I'm good at my job.<eos> Very good at it.<eos> I know how to look after my patients.<eos> All of this -<eos> - Nonnatus, Poplar. Terribly good at all of it.<eos> But losing someone?<eos> Nope.<eos> Not good at that at all.<eos> We only fail when we do not try.<eos> Now, are you sure you don't want me to wait with you?
Not good at that at all.<eos> We only fail when we do not try.<eos> Now, are you sure you don't want me to wait with you?<eos> Derek, I'll be fine. Go!<eos> Finish adapting the pram.<eos> Sorry, after you.<eos> Here we are, Mr Marsh -- what a lovely welcome party for you.<eos> Hello, George, love.<eos> Jess.<eos> There's someone else here for you, George.
You think that's how I want him to know me?<eos> I won't be a father like this, Jessie.<eos> Not like this.<eos> And I want to be a mother like this?<eos> On my own, unable to sleep at night for worrying if you're suffering, if you're frightened.<eos> Cos you're alive, and I'll take you deaf, broke, or blind.<eos> You know how much this meant to me today, bringing Bobby to you?<eos> Bye, love.<eos> Don't you know me yet?<eos> I love the bones of you.
A refund for the time I spent with Penny Reed.<eos> I came to Nonnatus House precisely because<eos> I wanted to go above and beyond for my patients, to be where I was needed most.<eos> And right now, it seems I'm needed elsewhere.<eos> In Hong Kong.<eos> With my dying father.<eos> When will you go?<eos> As soon as I can get passage from Southampton.<eos> You've made the bravest, most caring decision that you could.<eos> I'm proud of you, Pats.
In which case you're excused.<eos> And we're going to step to the side, swinging our heads down to the floor.<eos> Roses?<eos> I'm sorry they're pink.<eos> - They didn't have any red ones.<eos> - I prefer pink anyway.<eos> How are the children?<eos> They're looking after each other.<eos> We're all looking after each other, really.<eos> It's you I worry about.
And no men.<eos> All the bottles and powdered milk are packed and in the car.<eos> So, looks like we're ready for the off.<eos> Come on, then, little lad.<eos> Your carriage awaits.<eos> Wait.<eos> He can't go without an 'ankle.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> Take this from your mother, Andrew.<eos> And may God's love go with you always.
The changes have unsettled her.<eos> You don't think Sister Ursula meant what she said?<eos> I hope not, Sister.<eos> To leave all that is familiar would be the very worst thing for Sister Monica Joan.<eos> Sister Winifred?<eos> May I have your bag, Sister Winifred?<eos> You are to spend the morning at the Maternity Home with Dr Turner.<eos> Mr Buckle.<eos> I require you to furnish me with a bicycle.<eos> Draught very bad for you and baby.
I put fire out when skin dry.<eos> The skin hardly got wet.<eos> I've had enough of this!<eos> Now give me me baby.<eos> You need to be calm.<eos> Lin all right with me.<eos> Give me me baby, Ma.<eos> She's mine, not yours and I don't want you to have her.<eos> I just think she's too hot, that's all.<eos> I try to do right by you.

I'm early. Blame the army.<eos> No blame necessary.<eos> Punctuality is a very desirable trait.<eos> One we could all do with cultivating.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ladies, may I introduce Nurse Valerie Dyer, our latest recruit.<eos> - Welcome!<eos> - Hello.<eos> Shall we do our level best to convince her that we operate like a well-oiled machine?<eos> We've heard a lot about you.
Don't forget to go to the baby clinic.<eos> Another slice of toast, Reggie?<eos> You haven't got time, Fred.<eos> We've got to go!<eos> Right, have whatever you want.<eos> The bread's over there.<eos> How long will you be?<eos> Point on the clock.<eos> He wants you to show him on the clock when you're going to be back.<eos> Ivy used to do that for you, didn't she, Reggie?
You've stopped fighting the treatment.<eos> I'm too tired.<eos> Sister... I thought we agreed we weren't going to do this again?<eos> Come on, let's get you home.<eos> Warqad? English.<eos> - Post.<eos> - Good.<eos> Post?<eos> Let me stay, please.<eos> I don't have to go back, I can stay in England with you.
Nadifa, I know what's in your head feels real, but it's a memory.<eos> Look around you -- you're in London.<eos> You're all grown up and you've got a lovely husband and you're about to have a lovely baby.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I'm going to help you.<eos> No knife.<eos> No knife.<eos> I spoke to your neighbour.<eos> She's going to look after you, so you're not on your own.
Warfare's bad enough when you're in the middle of it. To have to keep replaying it in your mind...<eos> - Sorry. I'm sounding morbid.<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> No, if the world's about to be blown to smithereens, you deserve to be shown a good time.<eos> London is your oyster.<eos> You choose. We can do anything you like.<eos> Dine.<eos> Dance.<eos> Make merry.<eos> I'd think I'd quite like to sit here with you... doing not much at all and just see what happens.
Cyrus!<eos> White House Switchboard!<eos> Blue or red?<eos> You gonna get that? It can wait.<eos> In 20 minutes, I'll be at the White House.<eos> 19 if you'll tell me which tie to wear.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Do I seem nervous?<eos> You seem... you.
Mr. President.<eos> Cyrus Beene.<eos> Are your shades closed?<eos> What?<eos> Shades?<eos> I don't have shades. - I have handmade Venetian blinds.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Close them and lock your door.<eos> Red...<eos> Shut down your Wi-Fi, lawyer up, get a handler, a fixer, someone to talk for you, because in 30 seconds, you no longer talk to anyone.
Look, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> I am a happily married man, Cyrus!<eos> I love my wife!<eos> Nothing happened between me and this girl!<eos> Nothing was ever going to happen!<eos> You disgust me.<eos> The two of us are done.<eos> Frankie, don't be ridiculous!<eos> You know that I... would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Everything I do is to help you...
Frankie...<eos> Fr...<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> Frank... Frankie!<eos> You almost killed that girl.<eos> Jenny was a threat to your presidency.<eos> My... what?<eos> No, she was a threat to Frankie.<eos> You were supposed to scare her off.<eos> She was a threat to you.
You're the one who needs to start listening.<eos> I am not kidding or pretending or conspiring here.<eos> I am telling you.<eos> Do not touch him.<eos> You got that?<eos> I need you to understand!<eos> You do... Y...<eos> You don't want my help.<eos> I do not want your help!<eos> I do not want you!
Unbelievable.<eos> So, he's admitting to shooting Frankie Vargas?<eos> Under direct orders from Cyrus Beene.<eos> I'm sorry. You're gonna have to repeat that.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Tom Larsen confessed to the murder of Frankie Vargas.<eos> He will testify that Cyrus ordered him to do it.<eos> The FBI is on their way to Cyrus' house as we speak.<eos> And...<eos> And with Cyrus in jail, the Electoral College will have no choice but to vote for you.
I-I'm... I'm not convinced.<eos> What is there to be convinced of, Frankie?<eos> He'll make a hell of a running mate.<eos> Not only a seasoned Democrat but an integral part of a Republican administration.<eos> He's the best of both worlds!<eos> Look, I don't know the guy. I don't trust the guy.<eos> You know me.<eos> You trust me, don't you?<eos> Well?<eos> Of course I trust you.
I'm not a good guy.<eos> That's why you're perfect.<eos> We complement each other!<eos> You see all the bad sides. I only ever see the good.<eos> Y-You're making that mistake right now.<eos> And you're honest.<eos> See?<eos> I am not gonna let you say no, Cy.<eos> I want you by my side.<eos> I need you. America needs you.
Y-You're making that mistake right now.<eos> And you're honest.<eos> See?<eos> I am not gonna let you say no, Cy.<eos> I want you by my side.<eos> I need you. America needs you.<eos> So, what do you say, Cy?<eos> Will you join me on the ticket?<eos> You want me?<eos> I want you.
Come on, let's go!<eos> Come on, let's go in the water!<eos> Dad, what happened to your arm?<eos> It's, um... accident, work.<eos> It's, um... accident, work.<eos> How is it? We express deepest gratitude for this day and every day, for the gift of this passage and that we have found The Ladder.<eos> There is one spirit whose name is Truth.<eos> And let's send some extra Love and Light to Joy, who leaves tomorrow for 3R.<eos> Love and Light.<eos> We are so proud of you, hon.
And let's send some extra Love and Light to Joy, who leaves tomorrow for 3R.<eos> Love and Light.<eos> We are so proud of you, hon.<eos> I'm gonna actually miss you. Actually miss me?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> Who's crying?<eos> I'm not crying!<eos> Mom, I'm gonna see you in three months.<eos> No, I...<eos> I am so happy for you.
Horrible to say that to you.<eos> Nicole I love my children. I should remember how blessed I am and not say stupid jokes.<eos> I should remember how blessed I am and not say stupid jokes. I'm relieved that you make stupid jokes.<eos> Really, I am.<eos> The rest of the world treats me like they're on eggshells.<eos> Well, I just... think about you all the time.<eos> You leave the hospital, you think everything is better, and... you think everything is better, and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just... I feel so close to you these last few months.
Every summer, the population of this place explodes.<eos> Tons of tourists.<eos> Midwesterners from all over the place.<eos> Blue-collar, white-collar, loaded with cash.<eos> Okay?<eos> That's why I got this brochure.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Hang on, one second.<eos> I got this brochure last week, scouting businesses, and I brought it back to talk to Bruce about it.<eos> And I was gonna talk to you, because I wanna put the house on the market, and I wanna move down there with the family, and I wanna do what we do down there.
- What did I tell you? I've already sold that car, but I also have a minivan that I haven't sold yet.<eos> And this... It's a Honda Odyssey.<eos> It's... it's top-ranked minivan in the US.<eos> Blue Book on it is $27,000 and I get the cash...<eos> I'll buy the Odyssey from you for 27.<eos> So I owe you 20,000. Take that from the cash.<eos> And I'll lease it back to you for... say, 1,000 a month?<eos> Top-ranked minivan in the US.<eos> Okay?<eos> Good. Now I want you to take my $7,973,000 with you to Missouri... and clean it.
And not in that order.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Put it all back in his trunk.<eos> You know, Del, the other day you said... "Where's my $5 million?" and Bruce and the Hanson kid took eight.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was fishing.<eos> I didn't know they stole a damn thing.<eos> And you killed Liz on a hunch.<eos> On a tell.<eos> I've been working with you and Bruce for how long?
Please stop crying, Lucy.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey.<eos> I love you.<eos> I still... I have to get back to work, I'll get in trouble.<eos> You understand, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll come to you right after work.
Lucy, please don't.<eos> This is good news.<eos> This is great news.<eos> Think about it.<eos> We have a date, a real one.<eos> And all this business will be over soon, finally.<eos> Dramatic?<eos> God damn it, I used the wrong word!<eos> I didn't mean...<eos> You know, it's impossible to discuss anything with you if you get upset so quickly.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Ben.<eos> Glad I got you!<eos> It's me, Michael.<eos> Yeah, it has been awhile, that's why I'm calling.<eos> Be good to catch up.<eos> How about you and me go and grab some beers, now?<eos> Yeah, now, now.<eos> I can come to you.
Honey, I really have to go now.<eos> Why don't I just call you later?<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Gladys Perkins has an idea.<eos> I think she must've gone mad.<eos> She... she...<eos> Hello.<eos> - She wants to live with you.
Okay.<eos> I'm here, okay.<eos> What's up?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> That's a question for your mother.<eos> I don't wanna get in the middle of that.<eos> Mary!<eos> Mary.<eos> Your son is on the phone, he has a question for you.
It's okay.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Let's just... start over tomorrow.<eos> Michael.<eos> I wanted to say sorry, so I'm sorry.<eos> Come on, what have you got to be sorry about?<eos> Oh, 'cause, it's taken us so long to get to this point, and...<eos> I don't know, it should've happened sooner?<eos> But... we're here now.<eos> I wanted to celebrate with you.
Something "date-y."<eos> Then we can do each other.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you're okay with it, I'm okay with it.<eos> Poor Henry, let me hold your hand.<eos> It's not heavy, I can manage.<eos> Hold your own hand.<eos> Oh, Henry, when I do hold your hand like this, and put my arm around you and snuggle up to you like that,
Good, buddy, I'm just gonna need another minute or two here.<eos> - How's it going, buddy?<eos> - Yeah, I'm just having a look.<eos> Hey.<eos> She's leaving you.<eos> Who is?<eos> When your son arrives, she's gonna tell you then.<eos> And there's nothing you can do to stop her.<eos> Uh, meat is the other way.<eos> Behind you.
Hey.<eos> She's leaving you.<eos> Who is?<eos> When your son arrives, she's gonna tell you then.<eos> And there's nothing you can do to stop her.<eos> Uh, meat is the other way.<eos> Behind you.<eos> What?<eos> You're facing the wrong way.<eos> The meat you were going to get, it's behind you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey there, tough guy.<eos> Dad, yeah.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Happy you came.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi, Erin.<eos> - Really happy to meet you.<eos> I'll try not to say anything that will embarrass my son, but, uh, he has expressed some very fond feelings for you.
Hey.<eos> - Baby, it's okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sweetheart...<eos> ♪ I never thought I'd miss you ♪<eos> ♪ Half as much ♪<eos> ♪ As I do ♪<eos> ♪ And I never thought ♪ ♪ I'd feel this way 5' ♪<eos> ♪ The way I feel ♪<eos> ♪ About you ♪

Merci.<eos> How is Etienne?<eos> We haven't seen him for months.<eos> The rumors are that he's unwell.<eos> No, he's fine.<eos> He's just getting older, and...<eos> - My what?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I won't tell him.<eos> In fact, I'm happy for you.
Look, I...<eos> What is it?<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> It's not an original, but it's... It's pretty rare.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> You know, I know a guy who knows a guy.<eos> Conybeare Edition, 1868.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> You've been... you've been so good to me.<eos> A few months ago, I was on the brink, and now, thanks to you, I'm...
What... what are you doing here?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm just in Paris for a few weeks.<eos> I saw your poster.<eos> Sorry, I-I thought that was Whitney.<eos> That?<eos> God, no.<eos> That's... that's Elfrida.<eos> What, s... you and Whitney aren't...<eos> - Is she not here with you?
What happened?<eos> Etienne woke up.<eos> H-he woke up?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He was his old self again, actually.<eos> It was incredible.<eos> What, is he... is he still like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> W-what are you doing here, then?<eos> I wanted to be with you.
I set this whole thing up!<eos> Look, I gave you...<eos> I gave you everything you wanted... exposure to international artists, an experience you could parlay into an assistantship with anyone.<eos> I don't want to be an assistant. I love you.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I do!<eos> And I think you love me.<eos> - I said that when I was...<eos> - You said that!<eos> When we were fucking, yes, because I like fucking you.
Sweetheart, don't...<eos> Don't tell me what to do.<eos> I'm not telling you what to do.<eos> I'm asking you. I'm begging you, Whitney.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I'm not saying leave him. I'm just saying... let me help you take a break.<eos> Just hit pause, get off the merry-go-round, and take stock of where you are and what you want.<eos> I... I have nowhere else to stay, and I...<eos> You can... Just stay in my room.<eos> With you? I'll...
He was the one who was trapped.<eos> He was the lady in the tower, and I was the troubadour.<eos> I am such a fool.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I abandoned him when he was helpless.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was angry, so I left him to die alone.<eos> Juliette, don't do this to yourself, please.<eos> Looking after someone who's dying is... is hard.<eos> Etienne's nurses got to go home every night to their families, and even Sabine, she would go out with her friends and go back to her own apartment, but for you, this... this was your life.
- Yeah.<eos> Juliette, this is my daughter Whitney.<eos> - Bonjour.<eos> - Bonjour.<eos> Sabine, this is Whitney. This is Sabine.<eos> - Bonjour.<eos> - Bonjour.<eos> Merci.<eos> I'm sorry about not being here for you.<eos> Your daughter needs you, and my daughter needs me.
No deviation.<eos> No pause to contemplate eternity...<eos> Or beauty...<eos> Or death.<eos> Even you, for all your protestations of free will, if a box comes with your name on it, you can't even imagine doing anything other... Than obey.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.
- Hey.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, it's not your fault.<eos> Society made you this way.<eos> Hey, Gil?<eos> But you're a sheep, and you're living in a world of sheep.<eos> And because you're all sheep, because all you can do is obey, I can reach out and touch anyone anywhere.<eos> I can reach out and touch you...
- Come on!<eos> - I'm coming!<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> Can you believe we're even here celebrating my husband the FBI profiler?<eos> I'm still pinching myself.<eos> You were a rookie beat cop when we got married.<eos> Jim, you were determined always to become what you saw as the best version of yourself, to become someone that your family, your sons could look up to and admire.<eos> It's not easy being married to a stubborn man.<eos> I'm talking about you.
- These are my cookies.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> Don't pig out on grandma's cookies.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're living like an animal now, huh?<eos> Jesus.<eos> You kill those yourself?<eos> What are you doing in my house, Cole?<eos> Well, I don't want to be here, believe me.<eos> But the boss needs you.
You're living like an animal now, huh?<eos> Jesus.<eos> You kill those yourself?<eos> What are you doing in my house, Cole?<eos> Well, I don't want to be here, believe me.<eos> But the boss needs you.<eos> We need you to get into a room with Kaczynski, interrogate him, break him down, get him to plead guilty.<eos> We need someone who can speak the Unabomber's language, someone, uh, that he connects with.<eos> Besides,<eos> Ted asked for you.

Better to die a human being than to live as a purposeless cog in their machine.<eos> You dropped it in the mail a week ago.<eos> Gil.<eos> This just came.<eos> You want to be here.<eos> You want to be here, touching this, savoring it.<eos> But you can't be here.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Ever... for any of them.<eos> Why is that enough for you and not any other serial killer?
You want to be here, touching this, savoring it.<eos> But you can't be here.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Ever... for any of them.<eos> Why is that enough for you and not any other serial killer?<eos> Never to see it, hear it, taste it,<eos> never to see Gil Murray's body.<eos> Because it's not about him.<eos> It's not about him as an individual, is it?<eos> These aren't people to you.
That only looks like a tail stand if you're looking for proof of the supposition that he's an airline mechanic.<eos> If you're objective about it, it's just a switch.<eos> Do you ever think that the reason you haven't got him in 17 years is that you're underestimating him?<eos> There is a powerful intelligence at work here, a deep personal philosophy underpinning all of FC's actions.<eos> Now, you figure out the philosophy, you can figure out the man, you can crack the code.<eos> But not with this.<eos> We have to start over. Get rid of that and start over.<eos> Fitz, buddy, you're breaking my heart.<eos> You are part of a world-class orchestra here.<eos> Lots of instruments, lots of virtuosos, and out of all of these players, I'm pointing to you, and I'm saying now is the time for your solo.
Hi, Pasha.<eos> I'm... Mr. Eckert.<eos> Hey, Stan.<eos> Oleg Burov got on a plane to Moscow last night.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - Yeah. No minders.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... nothing's wrong.<eos> Or they're calling him back, and they're going to arrest him when he lands.<eos> They'd have to put a hell of a lot of pieces together to tie William Crandall to Oleg talking to you, especially this fast.
He talk, he-- he--<eos> Gets excited?<eos> - Yes. - Men all like to talk.<eos> Oh, he champion.<eos> How do you like it here?<eos> Different.<eos> But, um, at home, not bad, like Alexei say.<eos> It's not easy being in a new place.<eos> I was really worried about Tuan-- uprooting him in the middle of a school year and bringing him someplace new, with us working so much.<eos> At least you're home if Pasha needs you.
- So, where will you go?<eos> - Volantis.<eos> Good.<eos> If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.<eos> I'm not sure you'd be safe here.<eos> Oh, I will return, dear Spider.<eos> - One last time.<eos> - My lady...<eos> I have to die in this strange country.<eos> Just like you.
I thought, "That's true love."<eos> Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.<eos> No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear.<eos> Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.<eos> If only he hadn't taunted him.<eos> He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.<eos> But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?<eos> Now he's buried somewhere.<eos> And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.<eos> That must be difficult for you.
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her?<eos> I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are your profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?<eos> The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.<eos> From what I gather, she considers herself more of a revolutionary than a monarch.<eos> In your experience, how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?<eos> The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money, but Lannisters always pay their debts.<eos> Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?<eos> Your father's daughter, indeed.<eos> Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.<eos> And when you return to Braavos, I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.
You're making it difficult.<eos> You look a lot better brooding than I do.<eos> You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.<eos> I'm a prisoner on this island.<eos> I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.<eos> You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.<eos> Except to my ship.<eos> You took my ship.<eos> I wouldn't say we took your ship.<eos> I'm not playing word games with you.
Apparently, it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.<eos> Or stop them. Destroy them.<eos> Unsure about the nomenclature.<eos> And what do you think about this Army of the Dead and white walkers and Night Kings?<eos> I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong. But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.<eos> Which wise man said this?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?<eos> I would never do that.<eos> To you.
To you.<eos> The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.<eos> All of his advisors would have told him not to come.<eos> I would have told him not to come.<eos> And he's here anyway.<eos> You don't have to believe him.<eos> Let him mine the dragonglass.<eos> If he's wrong, it's worthless.<eos> You didn't even know it was here.<eos> It's nothing to you.
Unlikely.<eos> One could almost be forgiven for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.<eos> Don't know anything about that.<eos> I just started feeling better.<eos> I assumed it was the rest that did it.<eos> And the climate.<eos> The climate.<eos> You're free to go, ser.<eos> This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.<eos> Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Suppose I'll find out this evening.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.<eos> I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.<eos> Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.<eos> The only place for me is back with her.<eos> I owe her my life.<eos> Her and you.
Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.<eos> To send our remaining ships after him...<eos> I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.<eos> Would you have to go yourself?<eos> Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.<eos> You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.<eos> I wouldn't be alone.<eos> I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.<eos> What can anyone do to them?<eos> They can still do something to you.
But as a good friend of mine once said,<eos> "Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."<eos> And so it begins.<eos> They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.<eos> They will be outnumbered.<eos> They will have less armor and fewer weapons.<eos> But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.<eos> The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.<eos> They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.<eos> They will be fighting for you.
She's a monster, you do know that?<eos> To you, I'm sure.<eos> To others as well.<eos> But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, when people are living peacefully in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?<eos> You love her.<eos> You really do love her.<eos> You poor fool.<eos> She'll be the end of you.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?
It will, indeed.<eos> I need to expand my armies, my navies.<eos> My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.<eos> I know them well.<eos> They have helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.<eos> Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support.<eos> - As soon as the gold arrives.<eos> This is for you.
I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.<eos> Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support.<eos> - As soon as the gold arrives.<eos> This is for you.<eos> The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.<eos> The other dagger, the one that took her life,<eos> I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.<eos> I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.<eos> But I am here for her now to do what she would have done, to protect her children.<eos> Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.
I don't want to leave you, but when...<eos> When they come, I need to be with my family. And you're safe.<eos> Well, as safe as anyone can be now.<eos> You don't need me anymore.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> That's all you've got to say?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you?<eos> For helping me.<eos> My brother died for you.

- He's a thousand miles away.<eos> Look, it's cold and we're busy,<eos> - so, you know, best fuck off.<eos> If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?<eos> The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.<eos> - Which Lady Stark?<eos> - You tell us.<eos> You're the one impersonating her sister.<eos> Tell Sansa her sister's home.<eos> Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.
It's wasted on a cripple.<eos> Catelyn Stark would be proud.<eos> You kept your vow.<eos> I did next to nothing.<eos> You're too hard on yourself, my lady.<eos> I'm not a...<eos> Thank you, Podrick.<eos> Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.<eos> Soon.<eos> He will come back to you.
Fighting each other?<eos> They fought together against their common enemy.<eos> Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.<eos> Together.<eos> We need to do the same if we're going to survive.<eos> Because the enemy is real.<eos> It's always been real.<eos> And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?<eos> No, I don't think I can.<eos> I will fight for you.
And don't...<eos> - Don't fight someone like her in the first place.<eos> Nice sword.<eos> Very nice dagger.<eos> If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores, then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought. We can't...<eos> It's been a while since I trained.<eos> I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.<eos> He didn't beat the Hound.<eos> You did.<eos> I want to train with you.
You could've killed me.<eos> The fuck were you doing back there?<eos> Ending the war. Killing her.<eos> You saw the dragon between you and her?
How many men did we lose?<eos> We haven't done a full accounting.<eos> It's not only armies that win wars.<eos> We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.<eos> Not the same as our men, but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.<eos> I just saw the Dothraki fight.<eos> They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen.<eos> Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.<eos> Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.<eos> Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.
You need to find a way to make her listen.<eos> - Who's that for?<eos> - Jon Snow.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.<eos> What's it say?<eos> Nothing good.<eos> I thought Arya was dead.<eos> I thought Bran was dead.<eos> I'm happy for you.
They won't have to.<eos> You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.<eos> You're not in the Night's Watch anymore, you're King in the North.<eos> I'm the only one here who's fought them.<eos> I'm the only one here who knows them.<eos> I haven't given you permission to leave.<eos> With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.<eos> I am a king.<eos> And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.<eos> I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.

You're not staying here?<eos> I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.<eos> What if someone takes the boat?<eos> Then we're fucked.<eos> Best hurry.<eos> We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege.<eos> The Dothraki are coming.<eos> All the more reason for you to train.<eos> Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.<eos> Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
Nothing fucks you harder than time.<eos> Anybody give you any trouble?<eos> Here I am, arming Lannisters, and I never get a second look.<eos> But you were right.<eos> Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.<eos> Bad things are coming.<eos> You came to get me.<eos> You want me to come with you.
Our fathers trusted each other.<eos> Why shouldn't we?<eos> I saw your father once at Winterfell.<eos> I met yours in my shop.<eos> - You're a lot leaner.<eos> - And you're a lot shorter.<eos> I grew up on stories about them.<eos> All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.<eos> Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.<eos> Let me come with you.
As my father used to say,<eos> "It's better to be a coward for a minute, than dead for the rest of your life."<eos> I owe you my life.<eos> Twice over.<eos> But if what you said is true about what's up there, I can't wait out this war.<eos> Yeah, nobody mind me.<eos> All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> You may not believe it, but I've missed you, Mormont.<eos> Nobody glowers quite like you.

I heard.<eos> It was in the right, of course.<eos> Didn't make me hate him any less.<eos> I'm glad he didn't catch you.<eos> Your father gave me this sword.<eos> Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.<eos> But it's still Longclaw.<eos> Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back. And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back. And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.<eos> I'm not his son.<eos> I brought shame onto my house.<eos> I broke my father's heart.<eos> I forfeited the right to claim his sword.<eos> It's yours.<eos> May it serve you well.<eos> And your children after you.
And I heard this.(clapping sound)<eos> I looked up. And he was standing right here, smiling down on me.<eos> I knew what I was doing was against the rules but he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.<eos> The rules were wrong.<eos> I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.<eos> Now he's dead.<eos> Killed by the Lannisters. With your help.<eos> What?<eos> That's your pretty handwriting.<eos> Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles cause I couldn't write as well as you.
- They forced me to do it.<eos> - Did they?<eos> With a knife at your throat?<eos> Did they put you in a rack and stretched you till your bones started to crack?<eos> You should have known what it was like.<eos> I was a child.<eos> So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.<eos> They told me it was the only way to save father.<eos> And you were stupid enough to believe them.<eos> I remember you, standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father to the block.
I'll go with anger.<eos> You're the one they call the dog.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> They told me you were mean.<eos> Were your born mean or you just hate wildlings?<eos> I don't give two shits about wildlings.<eos> Gingers, I hate.<eos> Gingers are beautiful.<eos> Kissed by fire.<eos> Just like you.
- Cock.<eos> Ah, dick.<eos> I like it.<eos> Bet you do.<eos> Nop, it's pussy for me.<eos> I have a beauty waiting for me back in Winterfell.<eos> If I ever get back there.<eos> Yellow hair, blue eyes.<eos> Tallest woman you've ever seen.<eos> Almost as tall as you.
Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?<eos> Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?<eos> You do know her.<eos> We've met.<eos> I want to make babies with her.<eos> Think of them. Great big monsters.<eos> They conquer the world.<eos> How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
"I am the shield that guards the realms of men."<eos> Maybe we don't need to understand anymore than that.<eos> Maybe that's enough.<eos> Aye.<eos> Maybe that's enough.<eos> That's what I saw in the fire.<eos> A mountain like an arrow head.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Do you know what I like about you?
I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing.<eos> I don't want you to be a hero.<eos> Heroes do stupid things and they die.<eos> Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...<eos> Jon Snow.<eos> They all try to outdo each other.<eos> You can do the stupidest bravest thing...<eos> It's interesting, these heroes you name...<eos> Drogo, Jorah, Daarios, even this...<eos> Jon Snow... They all fell in love with you.
- Perhaps.<eos> Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.<eos> Perhaps they both needed time to contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.<eos> We had no time to discuss the possibility before you ended their possibilities.<eos> One can be forgiven for thinking you're taking your family's side in this debate.<eos> I am taking their side.<eos> You need to take your enemy's side, if you're going to see the things they do.<eos> And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them.<eos> Which I want you to do very much.<eos> Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.
Which I want you to do very much.<eos> Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.<eos> But the world you want to build doesn't get build all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime.<eos> How do we ensure your vision endures?<eos> After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?<eos> You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead?<eos> You say you can't have children. But there are other ways of choosing a successor.<eos> The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, among their many flaws...<eos> We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.<eos> Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss.
She seems very resourceful.<eos> You're worried.<eos> We're asking 20 000 men to fight with us in the worst winter any of them had ever seen.<eos> The weather will be the least of their problems.<eos> Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.<eos> You question their loyalty?<eos> Their loyalty is to Jon.<eos> Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.<eos> You're the Lady of Winterfell.<eos> The King chose you to rule in his absence.
I've been waiting for the end for a long time.<eos> Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.<eos> Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt.<eos> Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.<eos> Milady.<eos> Milady.<eos> It's an invitation. To King's Landing.<eos> - Milady, you are the Lady of Winterfell. - I am.<eos> And you will represent my interest at this gathering as you see them.<eos> They invited you, they want you there.
I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.<eos> And you trust their loyalty?<eos> You trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back?<eos> Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.<eos> He has become a competent swordsman.<eos> I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.<eos> I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.<eos> This is the safest place for me.<eos> Milady.<eos> I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister. If I abandon you...
Hey, Mom, I gotta go, I'm at work now.<eos> - Yeah, me too. - Oh, hi.<eos> - Hi, Mom. - Yeah, hey.<eos> It's not real Starbucks.<eos> Daddy gave me one of those Sofia Vergara coffee machines so I make it in that and then I put it in old Starbucks cups.<eos> That's money in my pocket.<eos> You ready for your first full day as an intern?<eos> Ooh, yes, Katie, it's gonna be so much fun.<eos> Like when I went to all of third grade with you.
I forgot to give him dinner last night.<eos> - And going to school. - Yeah.<eos> That's what I was supposed to do yesterday, damn it!<eos> Morning, everyone.<eos> Who has segment pitches?<eos> Oh, before we begin, I'd like to say a few words.<eos> Ooh, actually, interns aren't allowed in this meeting.<eos> I just want to say how excited I am to be here.<eos> And I want to thank Greg for hiring me, and, oh, Portia for that great interaction on the elevator this morning.<eos> And thank you, Carol, for your interesting take on the Black Lives Matter movement.
Thank you for ruining the show and dropping a steamer on my journalistic integrity!<eos> News is not the place for small talk and personal opinions.<eos> That's the problem with journalism today.<eos> It's more about the personality saying the news than the news itself!<eos> A real newsman has no personality.<eos> Walter Cronkite said one thing at the end of his show.<eos> "And that's the way it is." Not, "I feel meh today."<eos> Or, uh, "Mm, I like breakfast for dinner."<eos> I, for one, will not be betraying the news.<eos> I'm not a Benedict Arnold like you!
Because I am not just your co-worker,<eos> I'm your mommy.<eos> It never changes.<eos> You helicopter-parent me so hard that I end up getting burned in a fiery helicopter-parent crash. What?<eos> I'm just keeping you safe.<eos> Like I've always kept you safe.<eos> You kept me in a gilded cage.<eos> Oh, please, that was one time.<eos> You're holding me back, just like you did when I was a kid and you wouldn't let me go to summer camp.<eos> Because I waited all school year to hang out with you.
Oh, darn. I guess I don't deserve my after-show treat.<eos> Mm. Chilling stuff.<eos> Join us tomorrow for more on this developing story. [news broadcast music]<eos> Great show, everyone.<eos> Now where's that special cupcake I was saving for myself?<eos> I wonder if that was also his scotch I drank.<eos> Hey! I need my scotch and my cupcake!<eos> [blowing] [upbeat news broadcast music]<eos> I'm sorry, sweetie.<eos> I know that story was important to you.
Mm, it's because John Stossel once tricked him - into eating dog food.<eos> - [laughs] I've always been proud of my Lou Gehrig-like streak.<eos> And as the captain of this team, I consider it my duty to set an example.<eos> Same.<eos> Oh, I know I'm taking July off, but I need August off, too.<eos> I hate to do it, but it's for vacation.<eos> - Oh. - Anyway, I will be missing tomorrow's show so that I can accept a very prestigious award from "Cool and Young Magazine."<eos> Is that a real magazine? No, right?<eos> I assume in my absence you'll just run old Laurel and Hardy movies or something.<eos> It'll be hard, but I think we can manage without you for one day, Chuck
How many times did you use Chuck as an excuse?<eos> [high pitched voice] Umm, no other times.<eos> You know, Carol, when I asked you to arrange a ride for me, I meant a professional car service.<eos> Oh, shush your tush.<eos> At least picking up a sick kid is a job I know I can handle.<eos> What smells like marshmallow yams and curry powder back here?<eos> It's my new perfume, Bombay Thanksgiving.<eos> It's from Chico's Ethnic Harvest collection.<eos> I can't read how many of these pills I'm supposed to take.<eos> Do you have anybody back at your place to take care of you?
Do you have all that?<eos> I know it's complicated, but you gotta learn all this stuff.<eos> You're an intern.<eos> Mom, I gotta go.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a mom.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Oh! Who's kidnapped me?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Uh! I'm gonna take care of you.
- Yes!<eos> - What?<eos> E-even the set?<eos> What about that?<eos> That's my favorite part.<eos> Wow. Thanks, Chuck.<eos> - [plays pitch pipe]<eos> - Three, four... ♪ Shoo bah doo bah doo bah bah doo bah doo bah ♪ Well let's get you into makeup.<eos> Okay. So long, folks.<eos> And as for you, Fletch Trank, hit the bricks!
- You know what?<eos> It's still better than rehearsal. - Mm.<eos> - Well, that was a weird show.<eos> Angie should be happy, though.<eos> Chuck said her name, like, eight times.<eos> You think anybody noticed that I was reading Chuck his lines?<eos> [together] So when it comes to my reproductive health, there's no substitute for a vaginal self-exam.<eos> Ooh, I think I was reading Portia's lines by mistake.<eos> Does that matter, Chuck?<eos> - Back to you, Chuck.
I was embedded with the 69th in Afghanistan...<eos> - Got this little tattoo to honor them.<eos> - "Forever 69"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's what I miss the most.<eos> The men... every last one of those guys had my butt.<eos> I know how that sounded. I meant to say "back."<eos> You need good people around you when you're in the soup.
That's Chuck.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Chuck's a scaredy-cat.<eos> I tracked down the editor who used to cut Chuck's footage into something usable.<eos> He's at the Witherbelle Mental Asylum for the Insane.<eos> I guess he became an orderly when he didn't want to edit anymore. Ah!<eos> Is that a camel?<eos> Why is it making so much eye contact?<eos> - Stop. - Oh, Katie.<eos> This reminds me of the time I drove you and your little friend with the grey tooth to the prom.
So much paperwork.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Charlie, you're safe.<eos> Get me a cup of coffee.<eos> And spill it on yourself.<eos> Look at my little girl, hard at work at...<eos> Dave's daughter, what is this?<eos> It finally happened.<eos> I'm just like you, Mom.
Oh, that's another thing, he calls himself The Tripster.<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay, Trip, I have to stop blaming all of my relationship problems on my mom.<eos> Maybe she was just pointing things out to me about my boyfriends that I knew all along but I just didn't want to admit.<eos> So I'm really sorry, but this is over.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> You're a psychotic nutjob.<eos> You both are.<eos> You two belong in the Witherbelle Mental Asylum for the Insane.<eos> And, you know, I kind of expected this from Katie, but not from you, Carol.
I talked to the intern from "Morning Wined Up" and their staff hangs out all the time.<eos> You want us to be more like "Morning Wined Up" with Kelly and Mary-Kelly.<eos> Okay, now I like this duvet.<eos> Put it in your cart!<eos> Put it in your cart!<eos> Mary-Kelly, you are the reason the bank took my house. Ha ha ha!<eos> What am I saying?<eos> I don't have a house.<eos> I'm just saying if people were friends around here, it would make work better.<eos> There'd be less fighting, less complaining, less graffiti about you in the bathroom.
Pretty fresh, huh?<eos> Yeah, it's... it's... fine.<eos> I-I don't really know that much about fashion. I got this at a Halloween store. It's actually supposed to be Frankenstein's top.<eos> D-do you wanna talk about the story?<eos> We'll get to it.<eos> ♪ As you did tonight... ♪ What do you think of this tune?<eos> It was playing when my dog died, but... I still think it's sexy.<eos> Oh, speaking of... Of dead dogs, it turns out the superbug can spread through animals.<eos> Some people say it started when a bat flew into a dog's anus.<eos> Tell me... if a guy like me were to ask a girl like you out on a date, where would you wanna go?
You are a strong, modern woman. You need to march right into Chuck's office, grab that jerk by the collar, and kiss him on the lips.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's your only move. If you tell Chuck you're not interested, you'll embarrass him.<eos> But if you kiss him and then push him away and be like, "I want this so bad,<eos> "but you're my boss. We could never be together, Mr. Roker," then your problem's solved.<eos> But that doesn't sound very modern or empowered.<eos> It's like when phones got big and then small and then big again.<eos> Okay.<eos> No. No.<eos> I am never kissing Chuck Pierce. Well, you better think of something, because if Chuck feels rejected, he's not gonna want to work with you.
However, police are warning that the description is wrong and the guy probably looks the opposite to that.<eos> There he is!<eos> We now go live to over there!<eos> No!<eos> Well, I'm sure that's some sort of strange coincidence.<eos> Kevin is a beloved member of the MMN family.<eos> - He obviously didn't...<eos> - I did it!<eos> I set all the fires! Redheads unite and kill all the other hair colors!<eos> Back to you, Chuck.
Please, Katie, for the show.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine, but just temporarily.<eos> We're back in business, baby!<eos> What? Why do you have that?<eos> I've never taken it off.<eos> Fans from around the globe will gather at this midtown hotel to celebrate the 20th anniversary of "Dunston Checks In,"<eos> which this reporter urges all of you to check out.<eos> In Manhattan, I'm Katie Wendelson.<eos> Back to you, Chuck.

Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks, Angie.<eos> - You know, now that you have such a cool job, I may set you up with my nephew, the one that killed all those possums under my deck.<eos> - Ralphie asked about me?<eos> Mom, why is that woman glaring at you?<eos> Oh, her?<eos> That's my nemesis, Judy.<eos> She is so jealous because you're on TV.<eos> Her daughter's just a stupid senator.<eos> I am so proud of you, Katie.
You made a fool of me!<eos> Are you... magic?<eos> See, honey?<eos> I was right all along.<eos> You keep trying to limit yourself, and the universe just won't let you.<eos> - Yeah, I guess so.<eos> - Okay, next thing we need to do is work on your hair and your makeup and the way you say "water."<eos> What's wrong with how I say "woda"? - Ohh...<eos> - And please take off those dumb bird earrings.<eos> They're wearing you.

"Back to you, Chuck" is getting a little stale.<eos> How about... ooh, "We have the meats!"<eos> Isn't that an Arby's slogan?<eos> I thought of that independently.<eos> Okay, there you are.<eos> Why am I getting nervous?<eos> I don't care about this.<eos> Oh, don't you be nervous.<eos> You are amazing, sweetie.<eos> That's why all those people called in about you.

Anyway, I did some digging.<eos> It's 1:00 a.m., I'm staring at Kate Upton's natural larges,<eos> - and you know what I realize?<eos> - Okay, okay, I saw this coming.<eos> I love you no matter what, just promise me that you will wear the dress at the wedding and she'll wear the tux - with the sneakers.<eos> - No, Mom, that the hacks could be connected to something bigger.<eos> I found these message boards that the hackers use to talk to each other, and I found a source who is willing to talk, and that's not an assignment,<eos> - Mom, that is me, hustling.<eos> - Okay, I get it.<eos> Well, maybe I could be a hustler like you.
I have a lot of people<eos> - I need to tell off. - Okay, here's the script for the Biscuit Blitz piece.<eos> I picked the font that Katie didn't use.<eos> "I can meet to talk between 4:00 and 4:30.<eos> Who are you texting? Are you still dating<eos> - that undertaker? - No, Portia, I said I wish I was dating The Undertaker, from wrestling.<eos> No, I have a source, and he wants to talk.<eos> Oh, are you gonna meet him?<eos> Greg won't let me. He says I have bad instincts.<eos> Oh, he won't let you?
He called me an idiot and said I'd make a fool of myself.<eos> Do you think he's covering up some weird insecurity?<eos> Maybe that's a story.<eos> Who?<eos> Greg.<eos> What? Being weird.<eos> Why?<eos> Who knows?<eos> - Me. No, I don't.<eos> - I'm gonna do some more reporter-ing and find out, 'cause, thanks to you, Mom, - I have another hunch.
Yes, I was so condescending.<eos> And if journalism is half as important to her as Blitzing is to me, then, wow, just wow.<eos> Carol, thank you.<eos> Don't forget my jar.<eos> No, no, no, wait, ah, I'm crocheting you an apology, and it's not done yet.<eos> It's supposed to be a blanket that says, "I'm sorry, Greg." - I am sorry.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> No, for real. I meant to only privately humiliate you, and then, you know, maybe show our coworkers later.<eos> - Behind your back.<eos> - Unfortunately for you, you're not the only good reporter around here.

- Okay, well, you can't use the roof as your personal storage unit.<eos> Stosh the janitor gave me a key in exchange for my Netflix password, except now all they recommend is Polish shows like "Pierogi in the City."<eos> - I'm such a Wladyslavka.<eos> - Okay, well, just can you get this crap off the roof before Greg finds out?<eos> You're never going to use any of it anyway.<eos> Ooh, are those Venus razors?<eos> Could I have one? Actually, they're "Wenus" razors, but I got them for negative $40.00.<eos> (knocking) Hey, Chuck, you wanted to see me?<eos> Oh, yes, Carol.<eos> I have a very important job for you.
Oh, yes, Carol.<eos> I have a very important job for you.<eos> (gasps) Finally, what do you need me to do?<eos> Crack a witness? Go undercover as a slut?<eos> I need you to go to my home<eos> - and let the cable guy in. - Oh, I'd be happy to.<eos> I've never been to a celebrity's house before.<eos> He has a very exclusive party there every Sunday, Chuck.<eos> Thank you, Carol.<eos> I don't make a habit of letting people into my home, but I know I can count on you.
You know, she looks like<eos> - the Snow Queen in Narnio?<eos> - Julian Assange.<eos> - No, no, that's not it.<eos> - Mom, this might be hard for you to understand, but people deserve privacy, which is why I convinced the whole office not to look at Portia's hacked photos, and honestly, it-<eos> - Mom?<eos> You're already looking at them, aren't you?<eos> Oh, God, gossip, secrets, that's the stuff.<eos> Oh, you mean you haven't read any of these emails?<eos> - Not even the ones about you?
Oh, God, gossip, secrets, that's the stuff.<eos> Oh, you mean you haven't read any of these emails?<eos> - Not even the ones about you?<eos> - Wait, I thought it was just pictures.<eos> There's emails, too?<eos> So this is just a treasure trove of things-- not treasure, regular trove-- of things that Portia said about everybody?<eos> Well, I'm not interested because no deets, no matter how juicy, are worth betraying a coworker's trust.<eos> (sighs) You're right, Pumpkin.<eos> I'm not gonna open the red door.<eos> - I'm gonna be just like you.
How am I gonna explain this?<eos> What if I tell everyone that I made the statue because I'm in love with you?<eos> I made it with wax from - those little round cheeses.<eos> - Why didn't you just get rid of him like I asked you to?<eos> I don't know-- because he's not trash.<eos> What if you get the "Nightly News" desk,<eos> - and you need him again?<eos> - Not gonna happen, Carol.<eos> - That ship has sailed.<eos> - Oh, well, if it's too late for you then what does that mean for me?
I'm a 60-year-old intern, Chuck.<eos> I want a big career.<eos> I wanna be on camera one day.<eos> But if you, Chuck Pierce, one of the greatest newsmen ever to live, if you can't get the job you've always wanted, then what chance do I have?<eos> Chuck, there's so much to live for.<eos> A pet, maybe, a kid, if you have one, whatever holidays you celebrate, being on Wikipedia, I hope.<eos> (all groan)<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on. Just please, don't jump.<eos> We all really, - really, care about you, Chuck.
(all groan)<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on. Just please, don't jump.<eos> We all really, - really, care about you, Chuck.<eos> - Wait, did you hear that?<eos> Hey, Chuck, it's me, Justin.<eos> Hey, I just wanna tell you how much you mean to me.<eos> You know, I never had a dad.<eos> This guy, always with the dad stuff.<eos> But thanks to you, now I have a hero.

That is why you never open the red door.<eos> Katie, once again, you couldn't be more wrong.<eos> (stammering)<eos> Carol, thank you for opening the red door and for reminding me that it's not too late, not for any of us.<eos> Maybe-<eos> - Maybe dreams don't have an expiration date, unlike these 6,000 tubes â­of Crost flavor-free teethpaste.<eos> Could you please get this garbage off the roof?<eos> ♪ ♪ Ah, what a day.<eos> I can't believe I made - all the right decisions.<eos> - Aw, good for you, Mom.

It's really great.<eos> Actually, I just applied for a job as a news manager.<eos> Wonderful. What network?<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm sorry. That's confusing.<eos> I meant "gnus." G-N-U-S.<eos> The job's cleaning their cages at the zoo.<eos> I already heard back, though.<eos> I didn't get it. Okay, listen up.<eos> I know you're my baby, but I am done being soft on you.
You need to...<eos> I need to what, Mommy?<eos> You... you need to try more work.<eos> But I got fired.<eos> - Oh. - I don't know what to do.<eos> Maybe I'll become a bwand ambassador for a vodka company.<eos> Oh, Katie, forget it, forget it.<eos> You don't need to change anything about yourself.<eos> You're perfect.<eos> Mommy's gonna take care of you for the rest of your life.
Hey, Carol.<eos> Dad hasn't gotten around to doing my laundry yet, so I went into your closet.<eos> Zazzy, huh?<eos> Yeah, zazzy. Well, I got to go to work.<eos> Bye, pumpkin.<eos> Now, what to watch for the girl who has watched everything?<eos> Ugh, is that Gram's show?<eos> Yeah, I'll hate-watch this.<eos> This is "Pond Scum."<eos> Congratulations, Portia, Gram has named you new spokeswoman for her line of fascinators.
But really quiet so only I can hear it.<eos> See?<eos> Remember to feed your hat one worm a day.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Listen, Greg.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You need to give Katie her job back.<eos> I'm sorry, but what's done is done.<eos> You know what, Mister Man?<eos> I am sick and tired because I never sleep and I only eat casserole, but I'm also sick and tired of you.
- Hello?<eos> - Mom? I finally figured out who owns Biscuit Blitz.<eos> It's Gram.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> But it all makes sense now.<eos> Why did she mysteriously show up as soon as I started looking into that story?<eos> Oooh! And why did she fire me as soon as I started getting too close?<eos> Ahh! And why wouldn't she let me take home my bankers boxes after I had been fired?<eos> Ohh-aahhh-oohh! Hey, I've been trying to get in touch with Greg.<eos> Is he at work with you?
I've been really...<eos> Really good.<eos> Uh, how are things with you?<eos> Amazing, I'm actually doing really, really, really well.<eos> He was crying and asked for gummy aspirin.<eos> Thank you, Arnold.<eos> He's got a brain thing.<eos> - I did research...<eos> - At the office and it's... - And found out that Gram...<eos> - Not the same without you.
I just needed to trick you into confessing on camera.<eos> But I called the network.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I reprogrammed the contact in your phone to Beth's number.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't think it was weird when I said, "Okay, I'll shut down the show, Gram."<eos> I don't know your name.<eos> The bars and tone were a graphic, you crunchy-suit loving bitch!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> When I become a grandmother, I'm gonna be nothing like you.
I'll take a kiss.<eos> If you're giving 'em out. Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love other cultures.<eos> I'll take one too.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> You did such a good job today.<eos> Well, I couldn't have done it without you, Mom.
She's the one who's been working on that big hacking story I was telling you about.<eos> Ah, yes. The biscuit game.<eos> I'm anxious to know more about that.<eos> Katie, any updates on your story?<eos> Uh, no, but please keep bugging me about it every second<eos> - 'cause that's super helpful.<eos> - Okay, well, just get through those boxes because we do not want to get scooped.<eos> Uh, don't have to tell me about scooping.<eos> I eat two pints of ice cream every night, pal.<eos> Is this how the staff talks to you?
She was bossy, manipulative.<eos> She made me cut off my ponytail.<eos> What's that?<eos> You think I should grow it back?<eos> Pfft, okay.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm sure Gram will understand.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> - I will go to dinner with you.
- I was in my prime.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You went back to school 30 years ago?<eos> Sure. Only, I had to quit when you came along.<eos> Okay, don't feel bad.<eos> You were just a baby who came out of me like a tornado.<eos> My downstairs was destroyed.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you quit this time, Mom.<eos> I cannot learn this stuff.<eos> It's like you with fractions.
Listen to this.<eos> ♪ Yo my name is Carol ♪ ♪ And I'm here to say ♪ ♪ I protect my sources in an ethical way ♪<eos> - ♪ In an ethical way ♪ - [claps]<eos> What are you talking about? How are you in love with Gram?<eos> Well, I don't know, Greg.<eos> There's something about women like that.<eos> Gram, Darlene, that hot chick who hosted "The Weakest Link."<eos> The meaner they are, the more they drive me wild.<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> Same thing that's wrong with you, buddy.
God's here.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> How are you?<eos> God!<eos> Over here!<eos> Patti, look at you.<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> - Ooh! - Oh... oh, you're so sweet.<eos> - Aww. - Caroline, congratulations.<eos> - Aww. - Jim, I'm very happy for you.
Come on, then, Cyclone.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be quick?<eos> You're a punch out, Cornish.<eos> You're all talk, you are.<eos> Is that the best you've got?<eos> You won't last five minutes in there against Hoyle.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> What's the matter, are you jealous?<eos> You're too old for this game, pal.<eos> I could drop you like a hot scone.
Bigger things to worry about.<eos> Well, perhaps Jeb's promoter has a conflict of interests... ..bearing in mind his form for racketeering.<eos> Funny you should say that.<eos> There's been a late run of money on a knockout by Hoyle.<eos> Spread betting to ward off any unwarranted attention.<eos> Jeb might be the favourite, but the smart money says he's going to lose.<eos> No Teddy?<eos> He's already at the venue.<eos> Right, we'd better get a wiggle on.<eos> Did Roy Tomkins know about you and Rita?
Check out the shiner.<eos> Looks like she might be in trouble.<eos> Fighting for the vacant Southern Area Belt, with a record of 18 wins, two defeats and seven knockouts it's the Bethnal Green Bomber,<eos> Devon Hoyle!<eos> And Hoyle heads into the arena, looking fit, looking lean, looking mean.<eos> In the red corner...<eos> You need to get that money to Rita.<eos> She knows where to meet me.<eos> You can't jump bail!<eos> I vouched for you.
I have matches Saturday and Sunday.<eos> Both home.<eos> You coming?<eos> Of course.<eos> You doing homework?<eos> Just finished.<eos> - That our kid?<eos> - Bless his little trick turning heart.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Somebody wants to talk to you.
And then... he wasn't.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Your boy's in Room One.<eos> I'm sure he's thirsty by now.<eos> - I have to make a call.<eos> - I'll take this.<eos> This is Rick Jackson.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Jerry Edgar again.<eos> I can come to you. Whatever works.
No. It wasn't your fault.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> That's what they say at hospital.<eos> Pasha tell me all time he hate it here.<eos> And I not listen.<eos> I not listen him.<eos> I... I never think that life will be this bad.<eos> I hope he doesn't do this in Soviet Union. Because doctors there are not as good.<eos> They put him in hospital and they finished.<eos> Listen... I-I know it's not my place, but... your family needs you.
I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.<eos> But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> I told you he wouldn't.<eos> Let me talk to him for a few minutes.<eos> You can think whatever you want about the way Philip and I work, or how we handle our cover.<eos> We were running multiple operations during our time here, not just one like you.
Do you even know what a geisha girl is?<eos> They're Japanese.<eos> Are you really moving to Japan?<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> Tonight.<eos> It's so far away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.
Now remember...<eos> Remember this pressure point. Okay.<eos> Cover.<eos> Move.<eos> Cover.<eos> Okay?<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> You got it.<eos> Most people are gonna be bigger than you, so the point is to overload their brain.
It just feels shitty.<eos> I'm tired of feeling shitty.<eos> What?<eos> You're a really good person, Stan.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - I wasn't fishing for... - I know you weren't.<eos> I just wanted to say it.<eos> Not many people care like you do.<eos> And I know that you've been feeling stressed, and part of me is really happy that you're leaving, but...<eos> I can't help but think that your department needs someone like you who's not afraid to push back and stand up when something's wrong.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This is why we came here.<eos> Maybe you should stop.<eos> You need to keep getting the recordings. But other than that...<eos> I think you should just stop.<eos> Run the travel agency.<eos> You need me, Elizabeth.<eos> Not for this.<eos> I'm making you stay. And it just keeps getting worse for you.
I got you a grilled cheese.<eos> Police.<eos> I know you're here.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> Just a... friendly civil servant, looking to retire with his ass intact.<eos> Hello there.<eos> I see you're not quite feeling yourself.<eos> But we are gonna get that all fixed up.<eos> Now come on, son.<eos> I know you got folks out there worried about you.
Jesus.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Yeah, Firefly?<eos> When are we gonna get there?<eos> When we get there.<eos> Can I sit in the front seat?<eos> I think you still got some growing to do.<eos> I'm not a little kid anymore.<eos> You're safer back there.<eos> But I wanna sit with you.
How you doing?<eos> I really have to pee.<eos> Oh, well, go on inside, honey.<eos> How's Megan doing?<eos> Hey, Megan.<eos> It's me.<eos> Will you talk to me?<eos> I knew you'd hate coming here, but... I couldn't think of anyplace else.<eos> Least no one'll come looking for us.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you and Holly.
Look...<eos> She's gonna need a lot of understanding from us.<eos> We can do that, right?<eos> Did you come here when you were a kid?<eos> Yeah, a few times after Aunt Megan's family took me in.<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Why didn't we ever come?<eos> Well, it wasn't really a happy place for me and Aunt Megan.<eos> I gotta go see someone.<eos> I wanna go with you.
I don't want to stay here if this is a bad place.<eos> I didn't say "bad."<eos> I just said it's not a happy place.<eos> That's all.<eos> Besides, I'll be back soon, okay?<eos> You said you weren't gonna lie to me ever again.<eos> I will be back soon.<eos> Besides, you can take care of yourself.<eos> We both saw that.<eos> And you got Mrs. Giles looking after you.
I need to find Sidney.<eos> Well, good luck with that, son.<eos> He's a lot smarter than that.<eos> He's long gone by now.<eos> No, he isn't.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> Because I'm still here. He's got plans for me.<eos> Long as I'm around, he's not going anywhere.<eos> Why did you come to me?<eos> 'Cause I trust you.
Makes you wonder how far this thing goes.<eos> My wife. Hm! She swore one day I'd die in this chair.<eos> Said there are worse ways to go.<eos> Where's Sidney?<eos> The Beacon.<eos> The Beacon, he kept calling you.<eos> He say anything else?<eos> Just that... great days are comin'.<eos> Oh yeah, for who?<eos> Not you, that's for damn sure.
She was playing you.<eos> You dragged people into that basement, human beings.<eos> You tied them up and you...<eos> All I did was pick 'em up, that's it.<eos> How did he know where to find them? Who they were?<eos> He just knew.<eos> Had a bunch of names and sent me out to get them.<eos> And you did.<eos> You... Heh, you think he's just some sick old man?<eos> That he's afraid of you?
That's the tricky part, isn't it?<eos> You have a glorious evening.<eos> Door's always open!<eos> Kyle?<eos> Holly?<eos> Holly, are you okay?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hiding.<eos> From your mom?<eos> From you.
And the white-haired man.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Is he here? The white-haired man?<eos> They said what you did to me was bad.<eos> That you hurt me... and you should go to jail.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It got my mom and dad... like it got me.<eos> Tell me where they are.<eos> I'll get in trouble.<eos> Who told you that?
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> We're okay now.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't get a chance to administer morphine because our kit's in the truck, and his pulse is racing like a jackhammer.<eos> He's going into shock.<eos> We need to get him to a trauma surgeon, right now.<eos> Why are these guys after you?
Tell him.<eos> He has to know you're still alive.<eos> They made me reply to dispatch, Jake.<eos> No one's coming.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You hear that?<eos> The odds are stacked, and we've got the winning hand.<eos> The only question is, which life do you value most?<eos> Hers?<eos> Or that cockroach you got down there with you?
We got the guy we came here for.<eos> What about the jarhead?<eos> We'll cut him off at the top.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You said you were done here?<eos> We are done.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's a dark day for our club.<eos> But justice has been dealt.<eos> I congratulate you.
Marine, get fucked.<eos> Doesn't sound like they wanna negotiate.<eos> I'm gonna create a diversion.<eos> Draw them to the other side of the park.<eos> Wait till you hear gunfire, then make a break for the exit.<eos> Got it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ahhh!<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - You, too.
He was killing this club!<eos> And y'all are fucking blind if you don't see it!<eos> Are you gonna take charge, Alonzo?<eos> You traitor piece of shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Son of a bitch, I'll fucking kill every one of you!<eos> No!<eos> He's my blood.<eos> Leave him.<eos> I did this for you, I did it for us!
I've got a wounded man, GSW, severe hemorrhaging.<eos> Request immediate medical assistance and police backup.<eos> We're at the construction site, west of San Carlos Boulevard...<eos> Get to the roof.<eos> Go!<eos> I'm gonna kill that kid, jarhead.<eos> Hey, dead man!<eos> Yeah, you, dead man.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I'm coming for you.
Chayton Dockery's collateral: 150,000 in cash.<eos> Trial starts today.<eos> It's in the safe.<eos> Audrey, I looked.<eos> Okay?<eos> What I don't understand is why you lied to me, made me think you changed the combination because I'm addle-brained.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.<eos> Know where my mind went?<eos> You and Sam.
I wrapped myself up like a candy bar. You two were so hungry, you bit. Here.<eos> Here's your stuff.<eos> Well, not technically yours because you stole it like a bunch of hooligans.<eos> Okay. It's been fun.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your timing is good on the lifts.<eos> You know how to take a wallet out of bed and put it on its feet.<eos> You, it's like all you know how to do is spank down time.<eos> You just want to take advantage of opportunity.<eos> Not for nothing, but it would take somebody like you years to become a single-o.
Just don't do anything foolish. - I...<eos> - [click, dial tone]<eos> Just checking to see if you're set for today.<eos> You need a ride to the court later or anything?<eos> No, I'm set.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - Come in, Otto.<eos> Come in.<eos> Ah, Kwahu!<eos> For you and Audrey.
Just... just give me some time with him, okay?<eos> I have to fix him up anyway.<eos> We don't want Mukherjee. See his favorite dealer all busted up, right?<eos> Okay.<eos> But Eddie is going to deal that game, or I'm going to take more than one little fucking toe.<eos> Yeah, you will.<eos> You will.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> You need to listen to Karolina, okay?<eos> The only way that it works well for you.
Yeah.<eos> I remember. It was the last time I had anything close to a vacation.<eos> When we were leaving Bridgeport behind... [sighs] it was like a weight lifted off you.<eos> You said, "I wish we owned this boat."<eos> We could sail away from here, just you, me, and the kids.<eos> Look, what I did... was stupid and really selfish, and I've regretted it ever since.<eos> And I'd sor... I'm sorry that you had to find out from someone else...<eos> - Don't use Audrey as an excuse.<eos> - No, I'm not. I was the asshole, and I deserved you... kicking me out.<eos> You know she didn't tell you that to protect you.
- I can hit where it won't show. - All right.<eos> You know, I don't get you.<eos> How can you stay with a man like Vince after everything he's done, huh?<eos> You can't even go anywhere without this knuckle-dragger behind you.<eos> One kidney shot. That's...<eos> - Stay away from me, man.<eos> - All right.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Trust you?
Trust you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I think Eddie's scared and angry, and if I just could have a few minutes alone with him, I can talk him into dealing.<eos> Look, ahem, Vince gave me a job, and that job is you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Good to see you, huh?<eos> - Hi.<eos> I took the liberty of ordering the Heart Attack Special for you.
Because I am thinking about what you just asked me to do.<eos> Are you thinking about what you just asked me to do?<eos> No. I'm waiting for you to answer.<eos> I don't think you meant to ask it.<eos> I did.<eos> You really want me to kill Sean.<eos> I need you to kill Sean.<eos> Jacob's father.<eos> - Yes. - You want to kill a person.<eos> No, I want you to kill a person, which is nothing new for you.
I like it. I like it.<eos> Does the front yard have privacy, though?<eos> Yeah, I don't want people looking in on our shit.<eos> Okay, badass.<eos> Love you, too, baby.<eos> My girl is researching real estate, looking into school districts and shit.<eos> You must be confident you will get custody.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - Just coffee.<eos> So your girlfriend didn't want to come with you?
Help support you?<eos> She knows I fight my own battles.<eos> Obviously, Letty wants you to fight this one.<eos> I am not here to fight. No?<eos> Then why'd you ask me to meet you here?<eos> I know why.<eos> Really?<eos> You think I'm a piece of shit.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> So what happened between you and Letty?
She knows I fight my own battles.<eos> Obviously, Letty wants you to fight this one.<eos> I am not here to fight. No?<eos> Then why'd you ask me to meet you here?<eos> I know why.<eos> Really?<eos> You think I'm a piece of shit.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> So what happened between you and Letty?<eos> She didn't tell you?
How long are you gonna be mad at me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you remember how many times I asked you that same question... you gave me that same answer?<eos> Yep.<eos> You two are so the same it's scary.<eos> Did you talk to Kyle yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You need a lawyer, Letty.<eos> Okay?<eos> Not just for you, for me.
I am so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Well, hopefully it will be.<eos> Want to go shopping?<eos> Yes.<eos> Kyle said it has to look cheap, not ugly.<eos> I can't believe he's already dispensing fashion advice.<eos> Tiffany, he still loves you.<eos> He still wants to sleep with you.
I didn't think you'd all start fighting just because I e-mailed him.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Why do you want to be my mom so bad?<eos> Because I am your mom.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> But aren't you supposed to not lie to someone if you love them?<eos> You're right.<eos> I shouldn't have lied to you.<eos> I'll never do it again.<eos> I really want to be a good mom to you.
I'll get someone else to do it off that Deep Web thing.<eos> I tried to get Sean to leave.<eos> That's not what I asked you to do.<eos> Because Sean won't leave, which is why I didn't ask you to ask him to leave.<eos> - I asked you...<eos> - What I don't want is to do the thing you're asking me to do, and then you regret it.<eos> You will resent me for doing something you don't really want done.<eos> He's going to take him away from me.<eos> And me.<eos> I won't resent you.
I-It's not out of the question.<eos> But a kid could say anything.<eos> Jacob could say anything.<eos> Hey...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Custody almost always goes to the mother.<eos> Unless the mother is me and the father is a manipulative psycho.<eos> I read about a judge who granted custody to a mother who literally traded her kid for Adderall.<eos> It is not okay that you're here.<eos> I am here for you.
Okay.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Looks like you got everybody convinced you're not who you really are.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Don't be a sore loser.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> It's really very impressive.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> It's like "He is risen." Am I right?<eos> You came around, begging for those drugs, and then you begged me to take you... "Take me, Sean.
He is barely your son.<eos> - I gave him that book.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Ask him.<eos> Well, he really likes it.<eos> Good.<eos> Swear you aren't doing this to hurt me.<eos> I swear.<eos> And, by the way, it's not always about you.
What are you doing?<eos> Please leave.<eos> You were better in my memory.<eos> Jacob?<eos> You are not coming into this house. Get out of here.<eos> Mom, wait.<eos> That guy is a friend.<eos> A friend, really?<eos> Because that is an FBI agent.<eos> Your friend brought an FBI agent here to talk to you.
I'll wait.<eos> They wanted me to rat on one of my old dealers.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how does Jacob fit into that request?<eos> In a quid pro quo sort of way.<eos> I-If you have a picture of that drug dealer they want you to flip on, we could do a side-by-side comparison, decide which one is cuter.<eos> Maybe I'm crossing the line by asking, but where on earth is that man of yours?<eos> He's not my man.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> If I were you, I would go find him and apologize for whatever it is you did.
I cannot believe that something good has actually happened these last couple of weeks.<eos> Because it has not been good around here.<eos> How are you doing with all of this?<eos> You and Cyrus have been close for a long time.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's the country that concerns me.<eos> You don't have to be stoic, Fitz.<eos> Not with me. I've put hundreds of people behind bars, and I'm keenly aware that every one of them is someone's daughter, father, friend.<eos> When Abby said you wouldn't want to pursue the death penalty for Cyrus, it hit me that you are the friend this time.<eos> His guidance and support has meant a lot to you over the years.
You need to find your Oval.<eos> Something that these people value more than drugs.<eos> Is it food, their health?<eos> An inmate who snitched on them they'd love nothing more than to exact revenge on?<eos> The Oval.<eos> Everyone has an Oval.<eos> There's always an Oval.<eos> Figure out what yours is in here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.
What the hell is going on?<eos> Certainly not a Presidential address, is it?<eos> I would call this a love letter, but some of the language is just so filthy.<eos> You shouldn't have seen this.<eos> Elizabeth shouldn't have given you this.<eos> I made her.<eos> Some people are smart enough to be afraid of me, you know.<eos> I wanted to know what the hell her plan was, how she was planning to get you out of here.<eos> So I made her tell me. I wasn't expecting...<eos> This wasn't meant for you, Michael.
You never touched me like that.<eos> Is that what you like?<eos> Is that what you... Did you do that to him before you came back to me with that mouth?<eos> Nothing in this letter was true.<eos> It was all a ruse to get Tom to recant his confession, get him back on my side.<eos> Our side.<eos> There is no our side, Cyrus.<eos> Michael, please.<eos> Did Tom ever see the letters?<eos> Did she ever show them to him before she gave them to you?
Give me your belt.<eos> I can't let you hang yourself.<eos> I'll wait till your shift is over.<eos> I can't.<eos> Look, you don't want to do that.<eos> Please.<eos> Give me your belt.<eos> They're standard issue.<eos> You all have them.<eos> There's no way it traces back to you.
Huck!<eos> Yeah?<eos> We got something on Tom Larsen.<eos> Beene.<eos> I'm off shift.<eos> You still want the belt?<eos> It's no longer my watch.<eos> Can you give this to Ralph first?<eos> Goodbye letters.<eos> For you.
Plus he's green. He doesn't know what he doesn't know.<eos> He's not my first choice, - but...<eos> - Besides, I thought you couldn't appoint a Latino.<eos> That was before the election.<eos> Now I can do whatever the fuck I want.<eos> And you want Delgado?<eos> Walker does, and the rest of the commission will go along.<eos> You're playing me, Hector.<eos> You know damn well Delgado is not a good choice.<eos> I want you, Irv.
As far as we know, they haven't threatened her.<eos> When did you speak to her last?<eos> Bosch is staying in touch with her.<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> Word to the wise, Anita.<eos> Anything other than a professional relationship with Detective Bosch... is a bad idea.<eos> And not my style.<eos> Careful.<eos> Might be an IA sting.<eos> IA's after you, pal, not me.
Cool. Homework.<eos> Xavi.<eos> Captain.<eos> I understand you had a visit.<eos> Just chumming the waters.<eos> And that's how shit surfaces.<eos> If they had anything, they'd have come with a warrant.<eos> South Bay?<eos> On my way.<eos> Take Woody with you.
It's a lot easier when there are no children involved.<eos> Minor children, I meant.<eos> I know.<eos> Get my message about your pension?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I just feel that Connie's entitled to her fair share.<eos> Your next wife might disagree.<eos> Fat chance.<eos> Life goes on, Irv.<eos> A man like you... Especially for a man like you in your position...
Annabelle, she's not returning my calls.<eos> Maybe it's the holiday. She's gone home to Mama.<eos> I told O'Shea she'd testify.<eos> You what?<eos> I more or less guaranteed it.<eos> I thought you were going to tell him she changed her mind.<eos> I was hoping you'd take another crack at her.<eos> You're very persuasive when you want to be.<eos> Okay, I'll do it Friday.<eos> If we lose her, at least we've got you.
- And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?<eos> - My brother has always said that...<eos> - I don't care what your brother thinks.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.<eos> I do.<eos> But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.<eos> And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?<eos> I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just...<eos> - There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel.
Come, my love.<eos> - Is this your daughter?<eos> - No, this is my wife, Mrs. Baxter.<eos> You haven't met?<eos> - Good day.<eos> - Uh, no, I meant the young girl.<eos> There.<eos> - This is our niece.<eos> She is lodging with us while my cousin's family is away overseas.<eos> - I remember you from my first visit here.
Dr. Cairn made me understand that the root cause of my ailment is decadence.<eos> But I just feel so much more relaxed, and lighter even, just being around all these women who've truly embraced their healing.<eos> - Isabel, please!<eos> I can't follow a word you're saying.<eos> In fact, I think it'd be best if you came home.<eos> - No.<eos> I have to stay until I'm healed.<eos> - Of what? !<eos> What sort of nonsense are they feeding you?<eos> - I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you're afraid of what you don't understand, but I will not be leaving with you.
- It's about Dr. Cairn.<eos> His methods are...<eos> I fear that I cannot do what he asks of me, that I will fail him, fail myself.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> Another spoiled rich girl.<eos> So eager to be his pet. Yet you come running, crying to me, the moment he pushes you.<eos> - I just thought...<eos> - You thought you'd quit?<eos> Just like every other vapid socialite he's wasted his talents on.<eos> I expect more of you.
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.<eos> - My apologies.<eos> Perhaps you could call on him another time?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - My sweet, pretty wife.<eos> Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?<eos> - More.<eos> Your Faith doubts you.
A momentary flight of fancy, nothing more.<eos> Come.<eos> You've been working all day in the field.<eos> You deserve some rest.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> "Mr. and Mrs. Baxter, "you're invited... "9:00 at Rosewood.<eos> Aconite Society."<eos> Come, my dear.<eos> Are you ready to see?<eos> I've got a surprise for you, my love, something really exquisite.
She talks of dreams and now it is I who feel as though I walk through shadowed realms.<eos> - My Goodman.<eos> Come, let me guide you with my light.<eos> - There is a peculiarity in such solitude.<eos> With these lonely steps, I may be walking through unseen multitudes!<eos> What if the devil himself could be at my very elbow?<eos> I shall yet stand firm against the devil.<eos> Come witch, come wizard, come devil himself!<eos> And hear comes young Goodman Brown.<eos> You may as well fear him as he feared you!
Now, are ye undeceived?<eos> Evil is the nature of mankind.<eos> - Isabel!<eos> - Evil must be thy only happiness.<eos> - Isa...<eos> - Welcome, children, to the communion of your race!<eos> No!<eos> Isabel!<eos> - I, young Goodman Brown...<eos> - Isabel, help! Help! -...stand before you with the devil as my witness.
- Isa...<eos> - Welcome, children, to the communion of your race!<eos> No!<eos> Isabel!<eos> - I, young Goodman Brown...<eos> - Isabel, help! Help! -...stand before you with the devil as my witness.<eos> - Isabel, it's me.<eos> Isabel, please! No!<eos> - Oh, Faith.<eos> What would I do without you?
- Isabel.<eos> - Ah! Foul demon, leave me be!<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - He knows everything.<eos> You will tell him and he'll hurt me! - Isabel.<eos> Isabel.<eos> Please, you can trust me.<eos> - You keep calling me Isabel.<eos> I am Mary.<eos> But I remember you.
I've purified my home.<eos> - Bravo, Miss Porter.<eos> - You... you look like...<eos> - Isabel, it's a curious thing, appearances, isn't it?<eos> People don't look closely at anybody ma'am.<eos> - Gunther.<eos> Why?<eos> - I'm afraid that I have failed to properly introduce myself.<eos> I'm one of the four heads of the Aconite Society.<eos> The inner circle, as those unimaginatively like to call us - those in gowns and tuxedoes who imagine that they wield power, but they are nothing more than mere pawns, no different than you or any of the other girls

Okay.<eos> Okay. I apologize.<eos> Now, isn't this the part where we move on?<eos> I decide when we move on.<eos> I'm the boss, Sophia.<eos> This is the whole problem with you.<eos> You don't know your place.<eos> Hey!<eos> I needed to eat and I'm not about to die of malnutrition just to push heels.<eos> What's it to you?
Oh, fuck!<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> - The sun'll be back tomorrow.<eos> - Okay.<eos> This place is so fancy.<eos> This butter is in the shape of a shell.<eos> I don't know how they did it, but gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good to see you, Dad.
So, what's this?<eos> This...<eos> This...<eos> I... stole that earlier.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - Well, come on, no points for honesty?<eos> Sophia, you smell like the street.<eos> You got fired.<eos> Now you're breaking the law?<eos> The best thing for you would be to move back home, so I can keep an eye on you.
- Well, come on, no points for honesty?<eos> Sophia, you smell like the street.<eos> You got fired.<eos> Now you're breaking the law?<eos> The best thing for you would be to move back home, so I can keep an eye on you.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Sophia...<eos> No, Dad.<eos> I'm not moving back home. God.<eos> I'm worried about you.
You've had an ax to grind with Ian since Day One.<eos> How much did you really know about Pastor Ian?<eos> Stop this, please!<eos> You're going down another rabbit hole.<eos> - No, this is different!<eos> - No, it's not!<eos> Tom, we lost you.<eos> I don't even know what we lost you to.<eos> I know, all right?<eos> I wasn't there for you and Luke.
- Holden Matthews is the target.<eos> The girl is expendable.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was thinking... there must be a lot of places you wanna see.<eos> What if we didn't go back to Fort Reed?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm having an amazing...<eos> time with you, Charlie.
- And it's sick.<eos> - How about some lipstick?<eos> - It's so amazing to hear you say that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mom, we were thinking that maybe when you're feeling all better, that maybe you could come live with us.<eos> - Yes, Mom.<eos> - Oh, isn't that nice?<eos> You're beautiful. Catherine, you are truly beautiful.<eos> - I'll have what she's having. - You're beautiful.<eos> - Mom, we have a surprise for you!
Oh, hey, Jonah, can we get lunch sometime?<eos> I wanna talk about you being the legal guardian to my baby if anything happens to me and Mary, okay? - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I hope you're not here for Shawnee.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I am here with a final solution<eos> - to restore me to power.<eos> - Jonah, Jonah.<eos> Sir, I will do anything that you say. I know.<eos> That's what I love about you.
You remember Sally Nuefeld, our biggest donor?<eos> - Nuefeld department stores.<eos> You know, I'm so glad that I've just run into you, Sally.<eos> - You are?<eos> - We need to make a TV buy tonight.<eos> Otherwise, we're dead in the water.<eos> So maybe you could help us grease the knob or the wheel or whatever it is.<eos> - You know, I would love to, Selina... - Oh, great!<eos> But we've already given to a number of candidates this cycle, so...<eos> Yeah, you know, I wish your husband was here because I would love for him to hear about the story of you and Andrew on the bus with the pen.
- Zing! You got me, Ma'am. - Quartie:<eos> - Quartie!<eos> - Who's the head librarian now?<eos> I love the new design - on the building there.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> My God, looks like Queen Kong's cooter.<eos> That's what we were going for!<eos> - Hog jaw! - Yeah.<eos> That ain't the first time I spent 20 million<eos> - on a piece of pussy. - Oh, good on you, Quartie.
Tibet! It's all Tibet!<eos> We are gonna ride that Dalai Lama like Mrs. Lama on book club night.<eos> All: Hey!<eos> - And what about Montez?<eos> - She's a Mexican who stole your job.<eos> - She did, in fact, steal my job.<eos> - Her numbers are under agua.<eos> I can't believe this. We're back!<eos> I do need to talk to you about your role.<eos> And, Mike, I need to talk to you about your role, too.
So, uh, what do you think?<eos> - Beats working for Jonah. - Yeah.<eos> There's just one last thing you need to do.<eos> Mm, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Selina, you have to do it. - Mm-mm.<eos> You know, there's a restaurant in Kowloon that has a clay-baked chicken dish that you have to order 24 hours in advance.<eos> Yeah, Jaffar, I can't.<eos> I understand.<eos> 24 hours seems like a lot of hoopla for chicken, doesn't it?<eos> I mean I can't... I can't, um, go to Hong Kong with you anymore.
I've come all this way.<eos> Humor me.<eos> While you were in your coma, your mind traveled.<eos> "Traveled"?<eos> You left your physical body here in Fort Reed and your mind traveled to another world.<eos> And you're telling me I did all this while I was unconscious?<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> No, I... I understand.<eos> I just... don't believe you.<eos> Well, you're here now, so there must be some part of you
Call me sometime.<eos> I will.<eos> Oh, and, um... whatever high-flying act you've got planned, the ones that actually protect your skull are just over there.<eos> Right.<eos> Good tip.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yup.<eos> See ya.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's been asking for you.
It was so good having you two under one roof.<eos> Just felt whole.<eos> Dad mentioned the other night the Pastor?<eos> Of course he did.<eos> You know how he feels about church.<eos> At the house late the other night, Mom.<eos> Seems pretty... dedicated.<eos> I was up waiting for you and I was upset about how we parted ways.<eos> Pastor Ian's been counseling us since the accident and last night, he offered to keep me company.<eos> He was worried about you, Holden.

Come back and sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> You okay?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You're home early.<eos> - Yeah. I...<eos> I don't know if church is really my thing.<eos> I don't know if anyone's gonna blame you.
That bike...<eos> Hell, this whole garage...<eos> This was your church.<eos> You're a lot like me, son.<eos> We're nuts-and-bolts kind of guys.<eos> We see something that needs to be fixed, we fix it.<eos> We don't sit around and pray that it's going to fix itself.<eos> That's... that's crazy.<eos> Hey, Dad?<eos> You and Mom...
- What are you?<eos> - What?<eos> Kevin, I'm your friend.<eos> No, you... you were a vegetable for 12 years.<eos> And now look at you.<eos> People don't just wake up from a coma and walk out of the hospital.<eos> Kevin, you need to calm down.<eos> No, I know what I saw!<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> They were right about you, about what you could do.
You've got my number where Frost can reach me directly.<eos> Sit down!<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> You had orders to be discreet.<eos> Discretion is how this organization continues to operate with minimal outside interference.<eos> What you did... that was the opposite of discreet.<eos> Frost instructed me to find something out...<eos> And yet that moronic show and tell wasn't the worst of it.<eos> Your blunt-force tactics have likely spooked Holden, not that I blame him.<eos> He'll involve law enforcement... If he hasn't already... And photos of you in that hideous...
You need to be more aggressive.<eos> Emily starts at Westover in the fall.<eos> That plus mortgage payments...<eos> I mean, maybe it's...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Maybe you need to try something new.<eos> A sales job that doesn't require that you travel so much.<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, just a moment.<eos> It's for you. Mr. Frost?
Where is he?<eos> Arthur?<eos> Willa!<eos> Willa!<eos> Willa!<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> I don't understand. What happened?<eos> I was lost 'till Holden woke me up.<eos> He saved me, Willa.<eos> Holden was in there with you?
You got it.<eos> And if something happens, contact Willa with my phone.<eos> Nothing's going to happen. You hear me?<eos> How we doing with the supplies?<eos> They make it look so easy.<eos> You're cleaning that wound, right?<eos> Sorry, buddy, this is going to burn.<eos> Willa said you could get me home.<eos> It's not up to me, Holden.<eos> It's up to you.
Look, I say Karate Kid, all of them.<eos> I'm a Miyagi aficionado.<eos> I get how this works. What I don't get is what the hell I'm training for!<eos> You are supposed to control this place, not let it control you.<eos> - I could have been killed!<eos> - If you'd have been killed, then it would prove you're not the one we're looking for.<eos> So you're willing to let me die?<eos> Do it, Holden.<eos> Do it!<eos> Let the fire inside you rage.
Do it. Do it now.<eos> You wanted to lose control... but you stopped it.<eos> - That's a sign of strength.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I have to use that strength to go back in, don't I?<eos> That's... where I have to go, what I have to face to get home.<eos> Quickly now. There's more to do.<eos> What about all that crap you said about... preventing humankind from reaching too far?<eos> Because, honestly, this... this all feels way too far.<eos> Not for you.
My older brother died.<eos> But Ian showed us how to transform our pain into something... positive.<eos> Beyond this world.<eos> Sorry about your brother.<eos> That pin?<eos> Is that what it represents?<eos> Now it's yours.<eos> I... I don't...<eos> It's okay. No, it's yours.<eos> It has special meaning for you.
To find them before they find us.<eos> Little hand says it's time to rock and roll.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Where's the kid?<eos> He in the back room?<eos> Pop quiz, hotshot.<eos> You have a gun on my friend, and I have a .44 magnum on you.
And then you told Lance that if there was another opportunity to let you know about it right away.<eos> How long did he wait, what, two weeks?<eos> Three.<eos> Same type of deal.<eos> But bigger, right?<eos> Yeah, a lot bigger.<eos> A lot.<eos> Lance said Victoria's boyfriend found out about the property, and he was terrified he'd get charged with insider trading for giving her the information.<eos> Right, so then she needed to sell the properties fast.<eos> She said there were other investors that were interested, but because you helped her out before, she came to you first.
Four.<eos> I need a volunteer.<eos> Wallace.<eos> Come, come, come, Wallace.<eos> Wallace, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Wallace.<eos> It's Wally.<eos> - Wally.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Nice to work with you, Wally.
There.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> I'm just gonna need your cell phones.<eos> Marius.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Shit. What are you doing here?<eos> Here to see an old friend.<eos> So could you go get him for me?<eos> His name is Salty McGee.<eos> No, I'm... I'm here to see you, Pete.
- Winslow.<eos> - Let me talk to her.<eos> You won't be talkin' to anybody but me.<eos> - How do I know she's okay?<eos> - You can take my word, because there's only one lying' asshole on this call.<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen, I want to make a deal.<eos> Call me Monty Fuckin' Hall.<eos> You can have me.<eos> I'll even come to you.
God, I love you.<eos> Hey, look, let's go somewhere private and look at this.<eos> - Hm? - Yeah.<eos> Whatcha drinking'?<eos> I'm waitin' for a friend.<eos> I heard you're lookin' for a man who paints houses.<eos> Moe has a big mouth.<eos> Everything on Moe is big.<eos> Including his heart. He wouldn't have reached out to me otherwise.<eos> Get enough lectures from Audrey, I don't need one from you.
- Yeah, he's flying to India. Family business.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to catch him cheating if he's not even here?<eos> You know, fuck that.<eos> He's comin'.<eos> Baby, you can't force him to stay. Watch me.<eos> Okay, if you do that, he's gonna get suspicious, and then he'll never show.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hang on. Call him back.<eos> Tell him, uh, that your schedule opened up, and you would love to have lunch with him.<eos> We're gonna use his crush on you to get him to stay.
- Yeah, weren't thinking.<eos> Guys.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> I can make this good.<eos> Face the entrance.<eos> - Karolina. - Hm?<eos> If you don't mind, may I sit facing the entrance?<eos> I prefer the way the light radiates off you from that angle.<eos> Charming, as always.<eos> Not so difficult around you.
Don't you fucking say that it was about this trunk thing because I already apologized to you for that, okay?<eos> Porta-Potty.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Fucking what?<eos> When I was leaving the bar that night, all I could think about... was the time you tipped over the Porta-Potty while I was in it.<eos> W...<eos> Okay.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> I was an asshole to you when we were kids.
Nothing.<eos> It was all a misunderstanding.<eos> You're family, for Christ's sakes.<eos> There's nothing in the world more important than that.<eos> - [line ringing] - Fucking animal. Eddie:<eos> Marius?<eos> Eddie?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> How'd you get a phone?<eos> I told Karolina if I didn't talk to you that I was out.
- No.<eos> No.<eos> - I'm gonna ease you back in.<eos> Yeah, that's what we're going to do.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I need your head right before dealing to Mukherjee. Tomorrow night, all right?<eos> - All right, yeah.<eos> - You feel okay? Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> I'm depending on you.
Wheels up in five minutes.<eos> - Thank you. - I'll be at the car.<eos> Meaning you'll be having a cigarette.<eos> I'll be having a cigarette.<eos> You smoke?<eos> Only crack.<eos> Hey, I got to talk to you about something.<eos> But it's not good.<eos> There you are.<eos> I had a dream about you.
I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me.<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you still care about Marius?<eos> No.<eos> Marius ran.<eos> Leaving you with me.<eos> Maybe I should thank him. You know?<eos> Well?<eos> Well, what?<eos> Well, isn't there any part of you that has a bad feeling about this?
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.<eos> This is private property.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yeah. Chayton.<eos> Chayton.<eos> This is Otto Bernhardt.<eos> Listen... Well, there's a fellow here in my office, and he refuses to leave.<eos> In fact, he refuses to even talk.<eos> I suspect that he's here on your behalf.<eos> Actually, he's there for you, to help you make sure nothing happens to my money.
I told you, you have to beat them off with a stick.<eos> So I'm thinking an afternoon without the flesh anchors. Let's do a little day drinking.<eos> I could certainly use one.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> How about that place down by the marina?<eos> Sunday's all day Happy Hour.<eos> I love it.<eos> Uh, I need to finish up here. Give me an hour?<eos> I may have to start without you.
He left New Haven an hour ago.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just saying.<eos> No, you're just worrying.<eos> Hmm. Where else is he going to go - with a Geiger counter?<eos> Hi, Julia.<eos> I did what you asked.<eos> I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I know how tough this is for you.
Pay the tab.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,<eos> - and you can be the hero.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely not.<eos> You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> I'm the only one with the combination to the safe.<eos> And I give a shit because?<eos> I don't trust you, Pete, so I'll get the money, and I'll see you there at 8 p.m.
Deadline is Friday. Most sales gets a PlayStation.<eos> So let's really get after it, people.<eos> Ooh, got a great idea.<eos> Sell them yourself.<eos> Go!<eos> Go out in the neighborhood. Sell them out there.<eos> Aren't you worried about predators?<eos> I'm very cute.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> Your abuelita will be three feet behind you at all times.
Yeah, that was a little, uh...<eos> Queer?<eos> You come here.<eos> Is... is everything all right?<eos> Yeah, everything is great. Mami, cut the cake, please.<eos> And, uh, you guys go ahead and eat.<eos> - What are you two trying to pull? - Nothing.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Text her. Make sure she gets home okay.<eos> And after the party, we're gonna talk about you and Carmen.
Actually, I hear Austin's pretty chill.<eos> You can stay with us until we figure out how to get you to Austin, okay?<eos> But you need to be with your family.<eos> I can't believe they sent your parents back home.<eos> They didn't send them home.<eos> They sent them away.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> I think it's time to leave.<eos> Carmen. This is my favorite duffel.<eos> It got me through war, and I'm pretty sure it'll get you through Austin.
Damn it!<eos> Here you go.<eos> Well, on the weird blonde lady who forgot to take them home.<eos> Thanks, Alex.<eos> Thank you, señora.<eos> I'll text you from the airport.<eos> Text me from Schneider's car.<eos> You know I will.<eos> I thought you said I was supposed to keep it together!<eos> Well, that's you.
There.<eos> I hope it comes true.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Just top menswear designer in the country.<eos> And a world-class flirt.<eos> I wonder what he wished for.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I already got what I wished for.<eos> It feels so good to get into our bed. Yeah.<eos> It's a whole lot better with you in it.
This is good.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> I missed you so much, too.<eos> What'd you find out there?<eos> Nature.<eos> Canyons.<eos> Desert.<eos> You know how it is when you take a drive like that. And everything that's not important just falls away.<eos> Sounds like just what you needed.<eos> I thought about you a lot.
No.<eos> Honey, I can... No.<eos> Hey, shh.<eos> Just dream big.<eos> Captions by vitac...<eos> Yeah, whenever I drive through monument valley,<eos> It's just a reset, you know?<eos> Have y'all ever been there?<eos> It's so beautiful. It sounds so cool.<eos> When I grow up, I wanna be you.
No. But you should go.<eos> Wouldn't be so bad to have him as your personal stylist.<eos> I don't know. I don't even know what a trunk show is.<eos> Well, you... you show up to a nice house in belle meade. You... you hand your keys to the valet, go in, Someone hands you a cocktail,<eos> And you tell that outrageous flirt jakob. That you'd love to take him up on his offer. To help you out with your wardrobe.<eos> You don't think that's a little weird?<eos> Hey, he offered.<eos> And while you're at it, You might pick up a nice sport coat for your boyfriend.<eos> You sure?<eos> It's fine. I trust you.
'Cause it doesn't feel good.<eos> Rayna, with the exception of our marriage, This last year... It's been one of the worst years of my life.<eos> I don't much feel like wading back into it.<eos> And there's no point in wallowing. And telling the whole world our troubles again. Nobody said anything about wallowing.<eos> Wallowing, yeah.<eos> I mean, you know what I mean.<eos> I've been lower than hell for a long time and... I've just started coming out of that.<eos> Maybe I don't wanna give that up.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Nobody knows better than you that some of the best music. Comes out of some of the darkest places.

Okay.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm just picking up clothes, doing laundry, And taking a shower.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> You're the one who lives here.<eos> Kind of.<eos> My stuff does.<eos> I guess things are going good between you and gunnar?
Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm just picking up clothes, doing laundry, And taking a shower.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> You're the one who lives here.<eos> Kind of.<eos> My stuff does.<eos> I guess things are going good between you and gunnar?<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> Things going good between you and gunnar?
You know what?<eos> You just do it. I'm useless.<eos> I'm sorry, juliette.<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> You're not useless.<eos> Well, I might as well be.<eos> How am I supposed to raise a daughter like this?<eos> Well, not by yourself.<eos> I mean, you have me.<eos> Yeah, I have you for now.
Of course.<eos> That's okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just don't really see the purpose in not communicating. While you're thinking.<eos> You still thinking about it? No.<eos> What are you thinkin' about?<eos> I'm thinkin' about how you're bugging me. While I'm tryin' to think.<eos> Well, I'm thinkin' about how it bugs me. That you are not telling me what you're thinkin'.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what I'm thinkin'.<eos> I'm thinkin' that talking about what I'm thinking about, It actually prevents me from thinking about the very thing I was supposed to be talkin' about with you.
Don't worry.<eos> It's just a song, okay?<eos> Yeah, it just seems awfully specific. To be about nobody in particular.<eos> That's what makes it such a good song.<eos> I mean, we're songwriters. We write about universal themes.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> I don't need the job explained to me.<eos> I just would like to know who it's about. So I know what I'm singin' about.<eos> If anything, it's about me.<eos> It's about how I feel about you.

With the wrong person, saying the wrong thing.<eos> And I'm either trying to move on in my life without you. Or start my life with you.
But...<eos> Well, I thought you were thinkin' about our record.<eos> I am thinkin' about our record.<eos> Well, I just figured you'd finish thinkin' about it.<eos> Before you just went off and did something with somebody else.<eos> I just wanna play a little bit of guitar here.<eos> You know, I didn't know you wanted to start on this thing. Like right this moment, right now.<eos> Could you wait until we finish talking...<eos> I have to say it just kind of hurts my feelings.<eos> I mean, I came back from this trip. With all this passion about you and us and music. And our life together, and I felt like I found something
I'm sorry.<eos> But if you like, I can give her a way to reach you.<eos> Yeah. Emily, will you give him my cellphone number?<eos> What's her name?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> Her name is hanna lee. She goes by hallie.<eos> Well, could you tell her that... That she saved my life?<eos> She saved my life, and I wanna say "thank you."<eos> I sure will.<eos> And our prayers are with you, child.

You guys don't look much like exes to me.<eos> We have one of my favorite acts in the world here today... The exes, hot off your tour with autumn chase. So good to see you.<eos> Great to have you in the studio.<eos> It's always nice to see you, shawn.<eos> All right, you're gonna play your new single.<eos> It's called, "all of me." And I know you folks out there are gonna love it. As much as I do.<eos> Here they are... the exes.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Pretty good, right?<eos> It looks like it was made for you.
Well, I wanted to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> He didn't pressure you into it, did he?<eos> Or anything else?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He came on pretty strong at the restaurant the other night.<eos> That?<eos> I-I think he's just a good salesman.<eos> I-I know it comes with the territory, Having all these people wanting to get close to you. I mean, you're a star,
Like some place we could have a little studio, Have a yard, maybe get a dog.<eos> I don't know. What do you say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, got a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen... Our relationship is. The most important thing in the world to me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You are the heart and soul of... Everything.<eos> My creative process, my life.<eos> I can't imagine doing this without you.

Everything.<eos> My creative process, my life.<eos> I can't imagine doing this without you.<eos> And the idea that you thought I was trying to force you. Into anything or trap you in any way, Well, I'm just sorry about that.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I think I just got so excited out there on the road, About you and about this journey that we've been on. For our whole lives, you know?

For our whole lives, you know?<eos> What a long, strange trip it's been.<eos> But I know it's been messy and sad sometimes. And it's been painful, But always with so much love.<eos> And I wasn't thinking about how painful it might be for you.
Call me if you need anything.<eos> This button lets you buzz people in. And these three connect you to the control rooms.<eos> Got it.<eos> But whatever you do, don't push this one.<eos> Wait.<eos> What one?<eos> Just kidding.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> This is a lot of buttons to keep track of.<eos> Your mom and I are real proud of you.
Sorry I interrupted.<eos> Hey, what's your name?<eos> Maddie.<eos> Great.<eos> You need some help?<eos> I'm good.<eos> My god!<eos> Hey. Remember me?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I've been praying for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know how I could ever thank you.<eos> Please. I mean, I did what anybody would do.<eos> You were an angel.<eos> I'm just so glad to see you doing well. Yeah.<eos> I'm not sure how well I'm doing.<eos> But seems to be a lot riding on a toe wiggle right now.<eos> But...<eos> I'm here. You sure are.<eos> I'm gonna keep praying for you.
I'm just so glad to see you doing well. Yeah.<eos> I'm not sure how well I'm doing.<eos> But seems to be a lot riding on a toe wiggle right now.<eos> But...<eos> I'm here. You sure are.<eos> I'm gonna keep praying for you.<eos> We should get together sometime.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I would invite you and your friend in,
You know, with youtube and the internet. The way it is now.<eos> Music videos are a whole different deal.<eos> Very different from when they first came out in the 80s.<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> I mean, look at ashley willerman, The girl avery's producing.<eos> Yes. I just heard about this girl.<eos> Apparently, she had 30 million views. Or something on her youtube video.<eos> And she's about to make her first record.<eos> As long as I get to wear clothes, I'm in.<eos> I agree with you on that.

I didn't know you were in a meeting.<eos> This is for you.
But it has to be distinctive.<eos> It has to just grab the people.<eos> Like what?<eos> Stop by my cubicle. When you're all done, all right?<eos> And I'll show you some cool stuff.<eos> And let me know what you think, okay?<eos> And if it's too sweet, then I'll trade you.<eos> Okay.<eos> He's so cute.<eos> He has such a crush on you.
My god.<eos> I think you forgot something.<eos> My lyrics!<eos> You left it on the counter at the coffee shop.<eos> I thought I was gonna have to start all over.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And also I brought this.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I will make sure it gets into the right hands.<eos> No, it's for you.
It is yours. It's a gift.<eos> Okay... That's really, really sweet of you. But I can't accept this.<eos> But why not?<eos> Well, I mean, it just wouldn't feel right.<eos> You know, I hope you can understand that.<eos> It's just a car.<eos> It's not just a car. It's a brand new giant suv.<eos> It looks like it cost a fortune!<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Okay? I wouldn't be here. If it weren't for you.
I don't need some doctor. Telling me that it's over!<eos> I'm never gonna get better. Don't say that.<eos> I should have died in that plane crash.<eos> We both know that.<eos> You'd be better off.<eos> Heck, I'd be better off!<eos> Don't ever say that!<eos> It's the truth!<eos> No, I want to do it.<eos> Look, I know how futile this must all seem right now. And if you can't see your way through, Then I'll see it for you.
I always taught you do your best in everything you do.<eos> Well, no one told me that meant playing slave girl. To some ungrateful brat who's not half as talented as I am!<eos> You're out of line, sweetheart!<eos> She was a nightmare!<eos> To everyone! She made avery quit!<eos> It's not your place to call her out on that, all right?<eos> Do you know how many times I wanted to cuss somebody out. When I was your age?<eos> I thought that's what you did do.<eos> Then I hope you learn faster than I did. That sometimes you just got to take it on the chin, And watch your mouth.<eos> She was mean to you too, you know.
Sorry.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You have a look on your face.<eos> This is just my face.<eos> I guess I never noticed.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Cadence.<eos> Tell me again why we gotta wine and dine this dude.<eos> Well, we don't have to, but, you know, he's in Nashville, and he's interested in the country music business.<eos> Or is he interested in you?
Yeah.<eos> I'd love to have you in the building.<eos> Now, don't be disappointed if you don't get very far.<eos> It's normal since you're doing this way ahead of schedule.<eos> Well, the medical director doesn't seem to think it's too soon.<eos> Yeah, he's got all those degrees.<eos> I just work with people.<eos> Okay, you are fully supported, so you don't have to worry about falling.<eos> The harness will automatically lock and catch you.<eos> I'm gonna be right here beside you the whole time.
Thank you for coming.<eos> It's a real special night for us, 'cause this stage is where we really started.<eos> And my sweet family is here.

- See you, guys.<eos> - Bye, guys.<eos> They are phenomenal. - Yeah.<eos> What's your plan for them?<eos> We're trying to put together a music video.<eos> We just have to find a really great director.<eos> Totally.<eos> This has been such a great night.<eos> - Thank you, guys.<eos> - Thank you.

I've reached a point in my life where I only want to do things that I'm passionate about, and I do not want to waste any time.<eos> And I got this instinct about you, the company and me, I think it could make a good marriage.<eos> So if you are interested, let's talk.<eos> The guy has spent like three hours with you total.

Why me and not the other people on that plane?<eos> It's not 'cause I'm a better person.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> Help me, please?<eos> Hello?<eos> Rayna. Hey, it's Zach Welles.<eos> Oh, hey, Zach.<eos> Listen, it just hit me.<eos> I got the perfect director for you:
- The other day...<eos> - Listen, Juliette...<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> No, you go.<eos> I'm just sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have yelled like that.<eos> You were right about me, about why I hate being like this, helpless.<eos> - You're not helpless.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> I don't want to need you, but I do.
No, never.<eos> I could never feel that way. You got to know that.<eos> So I took it out on you.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I lied to you about the pills.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know how hard it's been.<eos> I mean, I don't know.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> - It's been harder on you.
- It's so obvious.<eos> - No, that's not it.<eos> How can I believe you?<eos> You know how much I wanted that apartment.<eos> Look, you have every right to hate me.<eos> I can't even explain why.<eos> I just...<eos> What?<eos> Just be real with me, Will.<eos> I don't want to live with you.
I was such a baby when I did that.<eos> Excuse me. "Billboard" number one for six weeks.<eos> - Good.<eos> I like finding out everything there is to know about a subject.<eos> Yes. - And guess what I found out.<eos> - What?<eos> Luke Wheeler is selling Wheelin' Dealin'.<eos> - No, he's not.<eos> - Yeah. He still wants to sing. He's just tired of the business.<eos> Who told you that?
Luke Wheeler is not gonna sell me Wheelin' Dealin'.<eos> You realize that we were supposed to get married.<eos> I left him at the altar.<eos> Right. You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Apparently, Hockney had been stalking Jaymes for months without her knowledge. According to the restraining order,<eos> Hockney must stay more than 300 feet...<eos> Can you turn that off, please?<eos> So is he just coming after you or is it me and Dad and Daph, too?
I thought you just said that there was no threat.<eos> Well, I just want to make sure we're on the same page.<eos> Just say it, okay?<eos> You hate him.<eos> I hate who?<eos> Clay? Yes. It's so obvious.<eos> All right, we're talking about security here. We don't need to...<eos> I don't hate Clay.<eos> I don't even know Clay.<eos> I think he's too old for you.
- No, no, no, no.<eos> We are gonna have this out right here right now.<eos> You think my reaction would be different if he was white?<eos> Yes. Honestly, I do.<eos> Here's what I really think.<eos> Not very long ago, white people and black people had a very hard time trying to be in a relationship together, even when we were younger.<eos> We knew people like that, and it was not easy. Just like for gay people, it wasn't easy. But, my God, the world has changed.<eos> People can make choices that they didn't use to be able to make, and that is an amazing thing. So if he was your age, I would say, yes, you go, girl. You love whoever you want to love.<eos> That is great with me. Thank you.<eos> But he's not your age, he's 24, and he's too old for you.
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right. I have to ask this.<eos> Girl, you can sing?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait. Was that a question?<eos> You know what my question's gonna be.<eos> Have I ever pursued it?<eos> Yes. Have you?<eos> I am pursuing it in my way. I just don't know if it would mean anything to you.
Girl, you can sing?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait. Was that a question?<eos> You know what my question's gonna be.<eos> Have I ever pursued it?<eos> Yes. Have you?<eos> I am pursuing it in my way. I just don't know if it would mean anything to you.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it's not about fame and fortune?<eos> What's it mean to you?
They're almost done. They're heading out.<eos> I'm worried about Maddie.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Wanna put a guard on her?<eos> I don't know. I just... I feel like we're all so vulnerable right now.<eos> And everything I say is wrong and... She's just a teenager lashing out at her mom. You know that.<eos> I don't know.<eos> By the time I was a teenager, my mom was gone.<eos> Can't fight about boys with a ghost.<eos> Baby... She needs you so damn much. That's what makes her mad.
Here we go.<eos> Look out for this guy. He steals all my best records.<eos> Oh, hey, hey, hey. I buy your best records.<eos> The price you pay, it's stealing.<eos> Oh, look what I found in somebody's barn this week.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Bob Wills "Smoke on the Water," 1945.<eos> - Kill me!<eos> - Perfect condition, too.<eos> But this is not for you.
I can only imagine.<eos> Yeah, learning patience was quite a trial.<eos> I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it was your feistiness that got you through this.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> You should.<eos> So I wanted to talk to you, because Luke Wheeler is selling Wheelin' Dealin' Records, and Highway 65 is going after it.<eos> Wow. So I wanted to see how you would feel about coming back to Highway 65.<eos> I'm flattered... and surprised, considering everything that happened.<eos> There's a lot of water under that bridge.<eos> I'm not sure... what use I'd be to you.
Yeah.<eos> That's gonna be beautiful.<eos> And you're regretting asking me to join Highway 65.<eos> No.<eos> I'm thinking to myself, whatever you do next, I want it to be on my label.<eos> ♪ Your kiss is a train... ♪<eos> You show me that bit again.<eos> What you did was great.<eos> What timing.<eos> We've just been talking about you for hours.
No. He won't take any medicine.<eos> He says it's like hurting his creativity.<eos> - Well, how does he act?<eos> - Mom.<eos> I'm just wondering how it affects his behavior.<eos> No.<eos> This is exactly why I can't talk to you about this!<eos> - What do you think I'm gonna say?<eos> - No. I know what you're gonna say.<eos> He's bad for you.
I asked her not to.<eos> At least until the deal is finalized, and I was hoping you would do the same.<eos> Sorry to hear that Luke's selling.<eos> He was good to me.<eos> We'll be better.<eos> Will, we think you're very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Special is a word that's applied to me fairly often these days.<eos> Yeah, and by idiots.<eos> We have plans for you, Will, big plans that I doubt Luke's people ever thought of.
Well, it's Nashville, honey.<eos> And as Rayna knows, I do pride myself on my research.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say you had my office bugged.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Well, do you?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Ever since the whole IRS thing, my heart's just not been in it.<eos> Phone calls, meetings, emails all the time.<eos> What I'd rather do is sit on my farm, write some songs, and then go fun places and sing 'em.<eos> Good for you.
- Well, I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> You want me to do this?<eos> Look, I want you to do whatever you want to do.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> So far, yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, that's it?<eos> I trust you, Rayna.
I tried to talk and nothing came out.<eos> - You can do it now. - No, I can't.<eos> - Hey, Flynn!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Be right back.<eos> What's up?<eos> So do you still want my number?<eos> Not if you're weird.<eos> I'm no weirder than you.
I'm fine.<eos> You don't want to go home?<eos> I'm a mess and he didn't even talk to me, sweetie. You sure?<eos> He didn't attack me.<eos> He gave me a letter.<eos> Well, honey, I think I'd feel better having you home.<eos> - You're not upset?<eos> - Do you want me to be upset?<eos> No. In fact, I think you handled it amazingly.<eos> I'm very proud of you, but I just...
I'm very proud of you, but I just...<eos> We have concert rehearsal, so I will see you guys later.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Well, she's certainly not in any danger.<eos> Look, I know this is very upsetting to both of you, but as long as she's okay with it, we're probably better off not making her think it's a bigger thing than it is.<eos> Right, right.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> ♪ And your kiss gives me amnesia ♪ ♪ If you told me, I'd believe you ♪ ♪ I was just born ♪<eos> ♪ Before you ♪

I do the unexpected.<eos> Look, you should let me go.<eos> - Why would I do that?<eos> - Because I scare you.<eos> Well, that's a reason not to let you go.<eos> Okay, that makes no sense.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> You do things that scare you every day.<eos> It's just not part of the show you put on for the world.<eos> It's a part of you I want to know.
- This didn't even come through the mail.<eos> It didn't have a stamp on it or anything.<eos> - Which means they were here.<eos> - Randall has just come on to help us with our marketing and social media.<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> - Hey!<eos> What's your name?<eos> Maddie.<eos> If you will let me, I think could help Highway 65 flourish.<eos> I got the perfect director for you.
Yeah, um.... as crazy as it sounds,<eos> I actually knew something before you came along.<eos> Well, you know, where you got to go listen to music is... - Joe's.<eos> - What's that?<eos> For real?<eos> Oh, my God, I get it.<eos> I am sheltered and uncultured.<eos> - Now stop saying that!<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> It's probably not the best place for a girl like you anyway. - That's not fair.

No!<eos> Like you're actually trying to hit him in the head!<eos> Grab her!<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> Keep rolling.<eos> - Is that you being angry?<eos> - What?<eos> Do you even know what angry means?<eos> Show it to me.<eos> Dammit! I have seen Buddhist monks with bigger tempers than you!
Now don't let him win.<eos> And don't you dare go easy on her.<eos> We're still rolling. Go!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cut!<eos> That's a wrap on today.<eos> You...<eos> You were amazing.<eos> And as for you...
I'm asking you to seduce this man with your eyes, your lips, your hands, your pelvis.<eos> What was holding you back?<eos> It's not me.<eos> Elaborate.<eos> I don't do the things you're asking me to do.<eos> I don't move the way you're asking me to move,<eos> - at least, not in public.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> It's degrading?<eos> You think that if you behave in a certain way, people will value you less?
- ♪ Shine upon us with love... ♪<eos> - All right, where we going here?<eos> Oh, dude, check it out.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, buddy!<eos> Play "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"!<eos> - Look, I don't know it.<eos> - You ain't got to lie, man.<eos> Everybody knows it.<eos> Tell you what. It's $20 in it for you.
- Look, I don't know it.<eos> - You ain't got to lie, man.<eos> Everybody knows it.<eos> Tell you what. It's $20 in it for you.<eos> Well, you saying our money's no good here?<eos> No, I'm saying, it's a crap song.<eos> What's your problem, huh?<eos> You think you're better than us?<eos> What you looking at?<eos> You know, we're gonna be doing one of these for you and Deacon soon enough.
I'm Zach Welles, I'm a business partner of Rayna's.<eos> Oh, then I know who you are too.<eos> Hey, listen... what's Luke got you doing at Wheelin'?<eos> Opening up for him.<eos> Right, but what's his overall vision?<eos> Uh, I guess just get the music out there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If only that was what it was all about, right?<eos> You know, I am friendly with the arts editor at the Times.<eos> I'm sure he would eat it up if I pitched you as a feature.
Push in, push in, push in. You're gonna find him over your shoulder.<eos> Keep coming this way. Keep coming this way!<eos> Yeah, float past her...<eos> Come on! Look at her!<eos> How's she making you feel?<eos> Oh my God, you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on. Let's go. It's getting late.<eos> Is there anyone you want to call?<eos> Like maybe someone who could stay with you or something?
I mean, what do you want to happen?<eos> You want me to walk up to your parents' front door?<eos> Say hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.<eos> I'm your daughter's broke-ass older boyfriend.<eos> And, oh, by the way, I'm off my meds!<eos> - Nice to meet you!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, that's exactly what I want!<eos> Because you're brilliant!<eos> And I care so much about you!
I'm gonna go.<eos> Okay?<eos> Now her hand comes up into frame.<eos> Slow.<eos> Grasp his fingers.<eos> That's it.<eos> Cut.<eos> Okay, gang, that's a wrap.<eos> I imagine you more or less want to murder me right now, but I couldn't leave without telling you how incredible you've been.<eos> In any case, I see really bright things for you in the future.
So he can just come here anytime now? No.<eos> He still has to stay 300 feet away from us.<eos> Oh, that went so well last time.<eos> Yeah, well, this time we got security for the both of you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm sorry, baby.<eos> - We can't take any chances.<eos> Well, I'm gonna see Clay play at the 5 Spot on Saturday, so...<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> You're just gonna have to take one of the security guys with you.
Mom, I'm not going to a show with a creepy dude following me around.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> We don't have any choice in this matter.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Okay, I'm late.<eos> Can we talk about this later?<eos> Not really.<eos> So when it says in Isiah,<eos> "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you," who is he talking about?
So this is the challenge.<eos> If you're not in perfect peace, it says you still have to find what it means to trust.<eos> We all do.<eos> This really interests you?<eos> You kidding?<eos> Who knew you were secretly a dork?<eos> I love what y'all do here.<eos> It's just kind of amazing.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want to do my next album with you and the choir.
But you can't be treating me like this!<eos> I did nothing wrong!<eos> You need to talk to her!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Be prepared for some pushback.<eos> You know how many people have said that to me? I get it.<eos> You're a force.<eos> But this church, this music, these people.<eos> It's new for you.
And she really appreciates you giving her the time.<eos> - How you guys doing?<eos> - Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I want to start off by saying I have so much respect and admiration for this church.<eos> And for the music you guys are making here.<eos> And because of that, I want my next album to be a gospel album.<eos> And I would be honored if y'all would record it with me.<eos> Thank you, Juliette.<eos> Thank you too, Hallie.
Probably the same amount of time.<eos> So you think that's enough time to know why we come here together every week?<eos> Work so hard on this? What this means to us?<eos> No, no.<eos> I absolutely don't.<eos> And I don't think I ever could.<eos> You just love the music.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes! I just love the music.<eos> Which means it has no context for you.
And I don't think I ever could.<eos> You just love the music.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes! I just love the music.<eos> Which means it has no context for you.<eos> - No meaning that sets it apart. - That's not true.<eos> You just have to listen to the music to know what sets it apart.<eos> I feel like I'm transported when I hear your music.<eos> - I'm glad for you.<eos> That's good for you.
We need to talk.<eos> He's back in town.<eos> Oh, he never left.<eos> I knew it.<eos> And you been seeing him.<eos> I met him for lunch.<eos> So in other words, you slept with him. No.<eos> But you're going to.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Can't you see I'm just trying to be with you?
And I don't know what that means.<eos> We could see each other or not.<eos> I just know that I'm not going to cheat, and I'm not going to lie.<eos> So you are gonna sleep with him.<eos> Not everything is about sex.<eos> I need to go and be with myself. It's not either/or.<eos> No, no, you either are gonna sleep with the guy or you're not.<eos> Look at me.<eos> So much has happened between us that I'm numb.<eos> I don't feel anything for you right now.
But maybe after, I could stop by.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you feeling today?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Just something for you.
How you feeling today?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Just something for you.<eos> For what?<eos> You know. Yesterday was a big day.<eos> This is called a first moon gift.<eos> Oh, my God, Mom. It happens to everyone.<eos> I know, but this time it happened to you, so...
I realize that I'm just a guest here.<eos> Come on back, girl.<eos> Don't we gotta figure out what you want us to sing?<eos> Come on.<eos> ♪ Why can't I sleep tonight? ♪<eos> ♪ It's too damn hot in this bed. ♪<eos> ♪ I've been tossing and turning ♪<eos> ♪ With all this scorched earth in my head ♪<eos> ♪ And it goes on and on and on ♪<eos> ♪ It keeps coming back to you ♪
She did things when she drank.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew you'd get it.<eos> - 911.<eos> What's your emergency...<eos> - What am I hearing?<eos> - 911, what is your emergency...<eos> - Show me your hands now!<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> I trusted you!
Let's show him the music room.<eos> This way.<eos> Do you ever wish you'd done something completely different with your life?<eos> You mean like become an astrophysicist?<eos> What would you have done if you couldn't do music?<eos> Die. (chuckles)<eos> - I envy you.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because you just know.<eos> People like you are real lucky.
Don't hold that against me.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Or I could stay if you want.<eos> It's fine if you want to be a little rebel and piss your parents off.<eos> You really think that's what this is about?<eos> Look, I'm not good at this.<eos> I mean, it gets serious, that's it. I'm gone.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> Then why are you here with me?<eos> I don't want to fall for you.
So how excited are you guys?<eos> We're so excited.<eos> - We're kind of blown away.<eos> - You must be. - It's over a million views already.<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> But I gotta say, it's really a bit of a departure for the two of you to do a video like this, isn't it?<eos> - It is.<eos> You know, we...<eos> - It was a departure for me, too, and I think Scarlett was a real revelation. She took it to the next level.<eos> Yeah, Scarlett, what was that like for you,
Well, this is something.<eos> This comes out of...<eos> I been thinking about all that time we spent apart, and somehow it always felt... like you were there with me.<eos> Like, I mean, I just have a little here.<eos> ♪ Around the corner just a glimpse ♪<eos> ♪ Of the light shining in your hair ♪<eos> ♪ The smell of your perfume ♪<eos> ♪ Just like you were there ♪<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> So you felt like I was there with you even when I wasn't.
Bye, Gene.<eos> It wasn't even a town really.<eos> It was a farm at the end of a dirt road with a rural delivery address.<eos> But it was my whole world.<eos> Well, until I took my first airplane ride.<eos> And I looked down and I saw Natchez, Mississippi, my whole life really, and it fit between these two fingers.<eos> (both laugh) No wonder doing the video scared you.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Maybe you scared yourself.<eos> I just know I saw something in you, something raw and real.
I would love that.<eos> What's your game?<eos> Gin.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna decimate you.<eos> You just wanted to quit because I was winning.<eos> It's nice just being us for a change.<eos> Why don't we get a room?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - I'm dead serious.<eos> - I want to spend time alone with you.
Hey!<eos> What a great surprise!<eos> Ah, I can come back later if you're busy.<eos> No, no. Come sit.<eos> I was gonna call you today anyway.<eos> - Two million hits?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's incredible.<eos> - It's crazy.<eos> Well, it is. I am so proud of you.
Maybe we just need to go off on our own for a little bit.<eos> Just write individually, come back, see what we got.<eos> You want to write a duet album individually?<eos> It couldn't hurt, you know. - I mean, look where we are here.<eos> - Honey, you're so good at this.<eos> I'm so good at what, Rayna?<eos> - Quitting.<eos> - I'm not quitting. I didn't say anything about quitting, all right?<eos> - That's not fair because...<eos> - When things get real, you get gone.
Oh, nothing.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> So because he's gone, that means nothing's gonna happen now, right?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> This whole thing's been really confusing for me, and whatever it was about, it's over.<eos> Really.<eos> So you thought you felt something, but now it's over and I'm supposed to believe that.<eos> Yes.<eos> (sighs) I'm being honest with you.
Honey, I thought it was gonna be easy for us to write our story.<eos> It wasn't easy to live it.<eos> Why should it be easy to tell it?<eos> And, you know, I think maybe everything happened the way it needed to for us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe if we'd gotten together back then, we'd have... thrown each other away by now.<eos> All I know is I'm here... right now, and I'm not going anywhere ever.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> You're my favorite hurricane.<eos> I wrote something for you last night.

That's really her.<eos> You didn't have to come with me, you know.<eos> - Oh, excuse me, Scarlett.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Could you sign this?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> I just loved your video.<eos> Thank you. That's so kind of you.<eos> - Sure nice to meet you.
Will you be having drinks?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm not the one having second thoughts about us. Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> That's kind of unbelievable considering all the crap you've put me through.<eos> And I tell you one thing, the moment it happens, and you...<eos> Okay. I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe it hurt to hear it, Scarlett.<eos> Okay, I need you to grow up.<eos> I'm with you.
- No, thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm not the one having second thoughts about us. Oh!

I can't right now.<eos> Come on, don't make me crawl under there.<eos> You know I will.<eos> This is all my fault, I know.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's like a punishment.<eos> - I just know it.<eos> - For what?<eos> For all the trouble I've caused.<eos> No, this has nothing to do with you.
Is he still in the picture?<eos> We do not have to talk about that right now.<eos> I got nothing better to do.<eos> Well... I'm intrigued by him.<eos> I really am.<eos> - I'd like to get to know him better. - Mm.<eos> But then Gunnar looks so miserable.<eos> And says things like he's going to fight for me.<eos> And I'm lost all over again.<eos> Just 'cause he's miserable and he says he's gonna fight for you doesn't mean he's the one for you.
I know you haven't always believed that.<eos> But I hope you believe it now, D.<eos> 'Cause not just for you, but for him too. Y'all need to know... that you can rely on each other.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - All right.<eos> Fine...<eos> I will shut up.<eos> - all: Daphne!<eos> - What are you guys doing here?<eos> We decided if y'all couldn't come to the concert, we'd bring the concert to you.
Would you mind helping to pass these around to people? - Um...<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> No problem.<eos> You seen Deacon anywhere?<eos> No, I haven't. I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have to change her. Is there somewhere I can change her?<eos> Of course, you come with me down here.<eos> Hey, man, let me take that for you.<eos> This must be weird enough for you as it is.
I just came to see how you were doing.<eos> If I could bring you anything at all.<eos> Is it still raining?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - So Sorry. - What's the time?<eos> Do you want to come out for a minute?<eos> You can be like this.<eos> You can be any way you need to be.<eos> We're family.<eos> Zach gave me this for you.
I'm sorry. I just had to get out of there.<eos> You're not even gonna say goodbye?<eos> No, of course I was, I just...<eos> I didn't know what I was supposed to do in there.<eos> Well, can you come back in?<eos> Look, I'm so sorry.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I just...<eos> You can go.<eos> Look, maddie, I want to be here for you.
The children mostly.<eos> It's not 100%, but a judge would definitely factor in what the children have to say about this.<eos> I feel numb.<eos> Right now, all I can think about is Daphne and maddie.<eos> Deacon hasn't said one word to me about the girls.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Well, my lawyers say I'll be out in three months.<eos> The point is, I'll definitely be back here soon.<eos> Thank god.<eos> The girls have been with you from the beginning.
It's been a while.<eos> I don't feel...<eos> it's not feeling rusty at all.<eos> I just feel... Like I'm watching myself from across a room.<eos> Can't feel it in here at all.<eos> Hey, you will.<eos> Can I help with that?<eos> No, it's all done.<eos> I know this is so difficult, right now.<eos> I just want you to know that I love you, And that I'm here for you.

While I've been gone.

While I've been gone.<eos> Look, your aunt Tandy, and hey, we've been talking.<eos> And we think it would be best if I took care of you and Daphne because I can.
It's really good to see you.<eos> I've been thinking about you so much.<eos> And, like, remembering when my mom died.<eos> I never dealt with it.<eos> People just kept telling me to be a man.<eos> Whatever that's supposed to mean.<eos> I just... i figured a man<eos> Wasn't supposed to feel anything.<eos> You were all alone?<eos> Thing is that's exactly what I did to you.
It's an unusual place to hold a business meeting.<eos> Yeah, I like to change things up.<eos> Art inspires me.<eos> And... This isn't a business meeting.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'd love to take you to Berlin sometime. They have amazing museums.<eos> you are something else.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I think you must know that.<eos> People are probably pretty overwhelmed by you.
All right, I see your point.<eos> But there is a balance of power thing happening here.<eos> That I'm kind of uncomfortable with. Yeah, I know.<eos> We've established that.<eos> But what's really wrong with a few perks if it's easy for me?<eos> Why do you feel like you always give people something?<eos> 'cause I'm a dweeb.<eos> Okay?<eos> I want people to like me.<eos> I think you're doing pretty well. I'm just being honest with you.
That, my friend, is a reason to try to go through life in pairs.<eos> if you go through at all.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I just listened to my session.<eos> And?<eos> So strange to hear me singing Rayna's song.<eos> Yeah, I can imagine.<eos> But you are singing it for her.<eos> I just don't want to let everybody down. Look, Juliette,<eos> This isn't about you at the end of the day, right?
- Yeah.<eos> Really, I don't know what to say, just... Yeah, thanks.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to our celebration of country's very best.<eos> We have a great show in store for you tonight.<eos> But first, as you all know, We have lost one of our own.<eos> The incredibly talented Rayna James.<eos> And I'd like to start out our tribute tonight with someone that you all know,<eos> Singing, "By your side", will Lexington.<eos> Thank y'all very much.<eos> This one's for you, Rayna.
♪ You can come inside... ♪<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> Sit. I want to talk to you.<eos> I don't think I should do this.<eos> What?<eos> You're her daughter.<eos> Who better to sing a tribute to her than you?
Previously on Nashville...<eos> I want us to write our story.<eos> They're gonna film us while we're writing?<eos> I promise I won't get in the way.<eos> - (phone ringing) - Hello?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I've been texting and calling! What happened?<eos> (crying)<eos> No!<eos> You're her daughter, who better to sing a tribute to her than you?
It's like the 10th person that's called.<eos> Don't even know how they got my number in the first place.<eos> The nerve of some people.<eos> If you don't recognize the number, don't pick it up.<eos> That's my policy, all right?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I was just calling to check in.<eos> Let you know that I'm here if you need me... for anything.<eos> Even if it's just to sit next to you.
I feel like he can't see that I'm doing this for Rayna.<eos> I'm doing this for her company, for her legacy.<eos> Maybe with time...<eos> Well, that's the thing.<eos> There is no time.<eos> Now is the moment.<eos> The whole world's watching.<eos> That won't last.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he'd listen to you.
Okay, but you are made from the same clay.<eos> Would you try it?<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Let me take you.<eos> Yes. - Let's go, girl!<eos> - One second.<eos> - Okay, you promise this is okay, Dad?<eos> - Of course, it is, yes.<eos> Even though I'm leaving you and Daph?
Would you try it?<eos> Please?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Let me take you.<eos> Yes. - Let's go, girl!<eos> - One second.<eos> - Okay, you promise this is okay, Dad?<eos> - Of course, it is, yes.<eos> Even though I'm leaving you and Daph?<eos> Honey, look, if your mom was here, no doubt she'd be nervous for you.
And let me start, if I may, by conveying my deepest condolences.<eos> All of America is really brokenhearted over what happened.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now I was so moved by your performance of your mother's song the other night.<eos> What was going through your mind when you walked out on the stage?<eos> Uh, I was trying not to throw up.<eos> - That's fair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's completely fair.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
It's after your bedtime.<eos> Go get ready.<eos> You okay?<eos> What you wrestling with in that big brain of yours?<eos> Every time I think of mom, I feel like I'm gonna be sick.<eos> So I tell my brain not to think of her, and somehow that makes me think of her way more.<eos> I did exactly the same thing when I lost my mama.<eos> I tried so hard not to think about her.<eos> And eventually... I realized that sometimes the best medicine is to go ahead and think about her all you want.<eos> Reflect on her and all the good... and... you realize that all of that good is still... right there inside of you.

You know, I had the pleasure of meeting your mom and I was a really big fan of hers.<eos> And I have to tell you. I'm looking at you right now and you are the spitting image of her.<eos> - It's incredible.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> "Blue Light, Red Light" is like my sister's favorite album.<eos> But not your favorite?<eos> Just your sister's...<eos> No, it's one of mine, too.<eos> (laughs) One of mine, too.<eos> So, obviously, the circumstances, your loss, this has to be a confusing time for you, a very difficult time for you.
Gunnar, I'm so sorry. I can't do this to her.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They need me too much.<eos> I can't...<eos> All right, Scarlett, listen.<eos> You've done a great job helping them, okay?<eos> You really have, but you're not their caretaker.<eos> Deacon is.<eos> Seriously, I mean, you keep telling the girls to put one foot in front of the other. But what about you?
I can't leave them.<eos> We have a problem here, people.<eos> And that's why I have called this meeting so that we can put our heads together and try and figure this out.<eos> So help me fix this. Help me figure this out.<eos> Deacon, that album, whatever state it is in, is an asset, something that this company has precious little of at the moment.<eos> - It's an asset. - Yes, and, sure, down the road,<eos> Juliette will have a new record.<eos> And we need to get Maddie into the studio as soon as possible.<eos> But right now, Deacon, it's all we have.<eos> It isn't finished, Zach. I told you.
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm not the artist.<eos> But it does sound like you can finish them.<eos> If we use her scratch vocals, you add your vocals in...<eos> Do you know what these songs are about?<eos> - They're about love!<eos> They're about undying...<eos> Deacon, I'm trying to help here. I'm trying to hear all sides.<eos> I'm trying to hear all options...<eos> Let's just quit going around this thing! Go right to it, all right?<eos> You want something from me that I'm not gonna give to you!
There's outstanding payments to Wheelin' Dealin'. There's a tax due on Rayna's estate at the end of the year. Do you want to hear about these things?<eos> Because at the end of the day, I need to know that.<eos> It's not a charity. It's a business, Deacon.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> Come on, Zach.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> - I'm sorry, Bucky.<eos> Deacon, listen.<eos> Listen just one second.<eos> Nobody knows better than you what Rayna would have wanted creatively, nobody.
- Honestly, I'm not good.<eos> What's happening, baby?<eos> Everyone is saying that I don't care that my mom died.<eos> And I'm so sick and Juliette's saying I have to do the show.<eos> Maddie?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.<eos> I already told her I would.<eos> I'm sure Juliette means well.<eos> But it doesn't necessarily mean she knows what's best for you at the moment.
Listen to me.<eos> You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.<eos> I already told her I would.<eos> I'm sure Juliette means well.<eos> But it doesn't necessarily mean she knows what's best for you at the moment.<eos> I mean, look at her life.<eos> Look at some of the choices she has made.<eos> You come home whenever you want to come home.<eos> In fact, you should come home.<eos> Deacon needs you.
Oh, God, if Teddy knew I felt this way, it would just kill him.<eos> But I hate that I can't... share this with Deacon.<eos> I just don't see any other path.<eos> Not one that isn't paved with more pain, more loss.<eos> Can't stand it, though.<eos> It's eating away at me. It wears me down.<eos> Each day, I pick up the phone to call him.<eos> Each day, I lose my nerve."<eos> ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Maddie ♪<eos> ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪
It's just confusing to have good things happen to you at a time like this.<eos> - That's all it is.<eos> - Just like...<eos> I'll go upstairs.<eos> I just forgot how sad I was for one moment.<eos> And now I feel like the worst daughter.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> You are so far from that.<eos> If your mother was here right now, she would be feeling one thing and one thing only:<eos> proud of you.

What the hell are you guys talking about?<eos> Look, we all write about heartbreak for a living and now that it's staring us in the face, it's like we're afraid of it.<eos> We judge it like it's strange or weird.<eos> This man just lost the love of his life!<eos> How's he supposed to act?<eos> We need to... be there for him, not ask things of him.<eos> How are we supposed to do that?<eos> I'm sorry you saw us fighting like that.<eos> You know, it's just that Scarlett is very protective of you 'cause you're blood.<eos> And I feel like I have a very special connection with you too because of my relationship with your mom.

Not at all.<eos> What I mean is that every time I've stumbled in my career, your mom was there to pick me up even when I didn't deserve it.<eos> And I never got the chance to properly thank her.<eos> Maybe now I can.<eos> I just see so much potential in you.

You took a risk.<eos> Sometimes that pays off. Sometimes...<eos> It blows up in your face?<eos> Screw the critics.<eos> You poured your soul into this album.<eos> If you love it, it's all that matters.<eos> That is not all that matters!<eos> My fans hated it!<eos> They were thrown off.<eos> They're used to a certain image of you.

But it's not a single.<eos> Yet, okay?<eos> It just needs a little bit more work.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Look, with all due respect, I know that you guys have been working really hard on this.<eos> You've heard like three different drafts of this, Juliette.<eos> If it needed so much work, then why didn't you say something before?<eos> I should have, and I'm sorry.<eos> I held back because I didn't want to discourage you.<eos> Once you get out there in the world, they're not gonna handle you with kid gloves.
- I am holding it.<eos> - Yeah, I know you're holding it, but just hold it nice and tight.<eos> Keep it steady. Keep it right on there.<eos> - I am!<eos> - You're not holding it still.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> - Do you think I'm not tired?<eos> - Let's just stop then.<eos> Sweetie, we're... We're trying to save your grade here, all right?<eos> I'm not trying to be hard on you for no reason here.
- Let's just stop then.<eos> Sweetie, we're... We're trying to save your grade here, all right?<eos> I'm not trying to be hard on you for no reason here.<eos> I just need to know that this is getting through to you, all right?<eos> School is your job.<eos> You gotta take this seriously.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> No, baby, it's not for me.<eos> It's for you.
How much?<eos> Get lost.<eos> Hey, watch this.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad, is that you?<eos> Wait!<eos> I need money for college!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!
But this didn't evolve on its own. You changed it!<eos> And I'm sorry, but I liked it the way it was.<eos> Of course, you do!<eos> You're attached to it.<eos> But sometimes that holds you back, okay?<eos> When you were too close to see clearly.<eos> You don't think I'm seeing clearly?<eos> It happens to all of us.<eos> I am trying to make sure that you don't get hurt here.<eos> Okay, I have been doing this so much longer than you.

Hurts like hell when you learn the truth.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> It's just you can't push that kind of pain away.<eos> You gotta... You gotta own it, deal with it every day.<eos> That's being a man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, Gunnar, if you really want to be with her, you'll find a way.<eos> I just don't wanna mess it up again, man.<eos> I failed her so many times.<eos> Of course, you have and she's failed you.
That totally ruins it.<eos> You're supposed to be blind and be able to be objective.<eos> I am.<eos> And, objectively, your version's better.<eos> Shut up. Really?<eos> Yeah. I mean, that hook takes it to another level.<eos> Wait. Oh, God, that's hers.<eos> But it's not like the first one was bad. They're just different.<eos> You know, it comes down to personal taste.<eos> You're supposed to have good taste. That's why I asked you.
What?<eos> I just... I wish I could ask Mom.<eos> She was so true to her voice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - She was.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But she made some compromises too.<eos> Especially when she started out.<eos> So you think I should...<eos> I can't tell you what's right for you.
I can't tell you what's right for you.<eos> I'm just saying that, when you make music, you never really do it alone.<eos> Your band, your producer, your engineers, your audience.<eos> You're all in it together.<eos> And that's the point.<eos> Kind of what being an artist is, you know.<eos> Reaching out.<eos> ♪ Take me away...♪ I was so relieved to hear Daphne got home safe.<eos> - Oh, yeah, thank you.<eos> - Well, thank you, for making the time to sit down with me.

Maybe I could get a babysitter...<eos> Well, I can bring the girls if you want.<eos> You don't have to do... you know what?<eos> It's probably a bad idea.<eos> I don't think it's a bad idea. I think it's a hard idea.<eos> You know how much Rayna loved seeing you play at the Bluebird.<eos> She used to tell me she thought that was where you were most at home, artistically.<eos> I just don't think she'd want you to let that part of yourself go.<eos> I think she'd say something like,<eos> "Hey, Deacon, you know, you're made of music. It's the thing that's always healed you. And it's the best part of you.
Yes, sir.<eos> Just a little shaken up.<eos> Yeah, I shouldn't wonder.<eos> I was just standing up for our rights.<eos> That's not how you do it.<eos> - Travis!<eos> - Girl, you are a sight for sore eyes.<eos> - There you go, baby.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you for finding time to see me today.
Look.<eos> We know she has parents.<eos> - We know that now.<eos> - No, no, she doesn't.<eos> She has two drug addicts that don't care where she is or who she's with.<eos> Parents?<eos> No, that's not what she has.<eos> We don't know her real situation.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> - It's not you.
Because it is great news.<eos> And I'm really happy.<eos> I wasn't contemplating being a father any time soon.<eos> But we all have to grow up sometime.<eos> I think you'll be a spectacular mum.<eos> I've had zero training, so...<eos> It doesn't show yet.<eos> I think this can work.<eos> By this, I mean, this house, you and me, and baby makes three.<eos> Are you asking me to live here with you?
- Yeah, but...<eos> - Don't follow me!<eos> Meanwhile, Maddie Jaymes, daughter of the much mourned country super star,<eos> Rayna Jaymes, was arrested last night after an altercation with police in Nashville.<eos> Watch.<eos> No, he did nothing wrong!<eos> - Ma'am, if you don't...<eos> - This is insane!<eos> Maddie, look, this whole thing can blow over in a few days, okay?<eos> We're drafting you a press release.

- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Why'd you want to meet me here?<eos> Because there are reporters outside of my door.<eos> I can't get home.<eos> So sorry.<eos> How did they find out where you live?<eos> I don't know, Maddie.<eos> They followed me.<eos> It seems like everywhere I go, people keep asking me about you.
I get it, okay?<eos> I get it. You were just trying to stand up for me.<eos> But I could've gotten shot, okay?<eos> That's what I have to think about.<eos> Not whether or not I did or didn't run through a stop sign. But am I gonna get out of this alive?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I just think, I need some time for now.<eos> Are you saying you don't care about me? No.<eos> Okay, I'm absolutely not saying that.<eos> I'm saying if I care about you and you care about me, you just let me by myself for now.
What's over?<eos> Any chance of me being with him is off the table.<eos> When did you decide that?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It's done.<eos> Well, good, I guess.<eos> You need anything?<eos> A hug or something?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Well, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not watch you cry over another guy.
Why not?<eos> Because hospitals ask questions and want names.<eos> - Wrap it!<eos> - You're not staying still.<eos> Liv, listen to me, you're going to get an infection.<eos> Daphne, why are you here, anyways?<eos> Just go!<eos> Can't say I'm surprised.<eos> - This wasn't her choice.<eos> - And who told you that?
Daphne, why are you here, anyways?<eos> Just go!<eos> Can't say I'm surprised.<eos> - This wasn't her choice.<eos> - And who told you that?<eos> I told y'all this was a mistake from the beginning.<eos> She doesn't give a damn about us.<eos> Look, the label doesn't think that this music...<eos> Oh, come on, Hallie.<eos> It's bad enough she lies, now she's using you to deliver the bad news?
And you're the father.<eos> Okay, uh, uh, let's just slow this down a bit. That's impossible. You do understand the process of conception?<eos> Um, something to drink?<eos> Grey Goose, straight up, double it.<eos> - And for you?<eos> - Water's fine, thank you.<eos> We took precautions.<eos> Which have been known to fail, in case you haven't heard.<eos> - I don't like what that insinuates, but a blood test ruled out Gunnar.<eos> Look, I'm not telling you this to stress you out or to turn your life upside down, or anything like that, I just thought that you should know I'm doing this.
Just tell me what you need, financially or... whatever it is.<eos> Anything to make this easier for you.<eos> Easier for me?<eos> Look, this was just sort of sprung on me, I mean, you haven't even looked at the bloody appetizers, and guess what, I'm a father.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Yo, this is your house?<eos> Yo, you guys like billionaires or something?<eos> - No, musicians.<eos> - Damn, billionaire musicians.<eos> Follow me, I have stuff for you in the bathroom.
He won't return my phone calls, he won't return my emails.<eos> Yeah, I know why.<eos> What's going on?<eos> He wants you out, Buck.<eos> - Out of what?<eos> - Highway 65, everything.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> I knew it was bad, but I didn't think it was that bad.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen.<eos> Deacon, you know how much I care about you and the girls, and you know,
I should not have asked you to come over here.<eos> I understand it wasn't your doing, but I can't help feeling what I feel.<eos> I get it.<eos> I feel like I'm deceiving people into thinking I'm back to my old self and I'm not.<eos> I mean, I felt like an imposter when both my legs worked.<eos> You've become very important to me.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm coming baby girl.<eos> For you, for tonight.
You are deceiving your fans.<eos> You're deceiving everyone.<eos> I can't go back out there after all this time and promote something that nobody gave a crap about.<eos> Oh, well, if that's how you feel about the album, fine.<eos> But I defended you in front of people I love, who put their trust in me.<eos> Do you know what that's like?<eos> I'm sorry, okay,<eos> - I am so incredibly sorry.<eos> - No, no, I got to go.<eos> - Hallie, I really do care about you.
So uh, Emily told me what happened.<eos> Let me guess, you're on her side.<eos> You know I'm always on your side.<eos> Am I narcissistic?<eos> Forget I asked.<eos> You can't think about that now, Juliette,<eos> I mean, you're in over your head.<eos> We just have to get through this.<eos> You think I should cancel.<eos> I can't make that decision for you.
And there will not be a mini tour.<eos> Tonight was it.<eos> It's a tough world.<eos> The album didn't work.<eos> We love it but the fans and the critics, they didn't.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> That's on me.<eos> But I still want to see this through to the end, no matter what anybody says.<eos> Will you please sing with me tonight?<eos> Why should we be there for you now?
Hold on.<eos> Do you mind me asking how old you are?<eos> I'm old enough.<eos> If you want our help, I'd appreciate a little respect in return.<eos> 15.<eos> It's a little young to be on the streets.<eos> Do you have a better idea?<eos> Where's your parents? That's a good question.<eos> If you find them, let me know.<eos> So who takes care of you?
Miss Barnes, you okay?<eos> Juliette.<eos> Why did you leave?<eos> I didn't, sweetie.<eos> I would never leave you.<eos> - But I can't come home. - No!<eos> Oh, come here.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> You will always be my jewel.<eos> And I will always be watching over you.
We have a meeting with Councilman Bryant tomorrow.<eos> But in the meantime, I'd like you to meet someone, real quick.<eos> Um, yeah, sure.<eos> I don't know how much you know about the goings on in the tech world.<eos> But her name might ring a bell.<eos> Alyssa Green, I'd like you to meet the one and only Deacon Claybourne. Nice to meet you, Ma'am.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> The pleasure is mine, Mr. Claybourne.<eos> My friends who love country music say that you are a legend. Thank you.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about bringing Alyssa on board as our Chief Strategy Officer.
Thanks for coming.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> From the looks of it, you convinced half the labels in town to be here.<eos> Nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Hallie Jordan.<eos> Thank you all so much.<eos> It's a real honor to be playing at the Bluebird.<eos> ♪ I woke up this morning ♪<eos> ♪ Something on my mind ♪<eos> ♪ I'm here beside you ♪

Yeah, something like that.<eos> Want some mascara?<eos> I think I'll live without it.<eos> Hey, so good to see you.<eos> You too.<eos> How's your dad doing?<eos> Oh, he's doing okay.<eos> - He's just working late as usual. - Yeah.<eos> You can hang for a bit if you want.<eos> Thanks. Actually, I wanted to talk to you.
Why you looking at me? Dylan does it.<eos> Y'all better than him?<eos> Gotta make some sacrifices around here, all right? Not a big damn deal.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The other night, I saw someone play at the Bluebird, and it gave me chills.<eos> Now that has happened a couple of times in this town. But those moments are few and far between.<eos> So I want to thank my friend, Juliette, for introducing me to someone who we very much hope will become a member of this Highway 65 family.<eos> And it is a family.<eos> Hallie, artists like you are the reason why Rayna started this label.
You know how many videos of black people getting harassed by police get made every day?<eos> And 95% of them don't even become news.<eos> It took you standing up as an ally to people of color to make this a big story.<eos> You've got a platform.<eos> Don't you have anything you want to say?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Why not?<eos> I can't record without my band.<eos> George will be devastated.<eos> Oh, you mean the guitar player who says he's in love with you? But he still lives with his wife?
So, uh, that's Kevin Burns on the guitar.<eos> Dwayne Simpson on the drums.<eos> Allen Frazier on organ.<eos> Dawn McCarthy on bass.<eos> I just gave them the song like 20 minutes ago, if you can believe it.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Can I go sing with them?<eos> It's your song, Hallie.

So you're breaking up with me over this?<eos> Maddie, look... there's nothing really to break up.<eos> Okay, we were never really boyfriend and girlfriend.<eos> There was never a real place for us.<eos> We just couldn't admit it.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Will you just look at me?<eos> I care about you so much.<eos> And maybe it was because on some level, I knew this wouldn't work. But I let myself feel.<eos> And I feel so much for you.
- All right?<eos> - All right.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Oh, I love you too, baby.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm not sure this is gonna work.<eos> Okay, let's rewind a second.<eos> Wh-what...<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just don't feel like I can be myself as a musician and go out with you.
What's wrong?<eos> I'm not sure this is gonna work.<eos> Okay, let's rewind a second.<eos> Wh-what...<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just don't feel like I can be myself as a musician and go out with you.<eos> And be loyal to my friends at the same time.<eos> - I can't give up on who I am... - Time out.<eos> I love everything about you.<eos> I don't want to change you.
Ah, nothing.<eos> Just funny how life works sometimes.<eos> Alyssa got a call about you today. But I'm definitely not talking about it now.<eos> Well, what was it?<eos> - Never mind. - No!<eos> You gotta tell me now!<eos> You're the one who said you didn't want to sing about mops, right?<eos> Budweiser, the King of Beers.<eos> Already working with Thomas Rhett and Florida Georgia Line.<eos> And now they want you.
But I'm not sorry for trying to protect my friend.<eos> His name is Clayton.<eos> And because of what happened, a lot of terrible things have been said about him.<eos> And I really just want to clear that up.<eos> He is not my boyfriend.<eos> He is an artist, an incredible one.<eos> And... one of the kindest, most sensitive people that I've ever met.<eos> And I'm sure if you met him, you would feel the same way.<eos> And my actions have caused him pain.<eos> So, Clayton, this one is for you.
And now from Hollywood to Nashville where the online ship communities are buzzing over these new photos of country stars,<eos> Scarlett O'Connor and Gunnar Scott.<eos> An exclusive photo obtained by Access Hollywood reveals what looks to be a baby bump.<eos> For the on-again, off-again couple, this would be the first child for either of them.<eos> Their latest single, "All of Me", is lighting up the charts.<eos> Those are the latest headlines from Access Hollywood.<eos> - Bucky!<eos> So good to see you.<eos> This is the most excited I've been in 10 years.<eos> - I'm so proud of you.
Don't listen to a word this guy says. - (laughs)<eos> - Hey, I'm gonna send you her single.<eos> It's pretty unbelievable.<eos> I've already got it on repeat.<eos> You will not believe the emails I'm getting.<eos> They want you for gigs in L.A., Seattle, Brooklyn.<eos> We got to get a tour set up for you.<eos> It just means the world to me that you're willing to do this.<eos> Maddie, it was the honor of my life to work with your mom.<eos> And nothing could make me happier than to be here with you managing your career.
- Yes...<eos> You're telling me you want to do a different one?<eos> I can't go against Juliette after all she's done for me.<eos> Because "Who I Love" is a great song.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm being whiny and ridiculous.<eos> - No, no, not at all.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> I'm here for you.

I signed her because the artist in her spoke to the artist in me.<eos> Am I wrong here?<eos> No. I definitely know what you mean.<eos> This is way more commercial than what Hallie wanted initially.<eos> But I think that Juliette is just saying that she wants her to succeed like we all do.<eos> But isn't true success doing what you love?<eos> Doing it well?<eos> Isn't that why Rayna started this label?<eos> And sometimes doing what you love leads to utter failure if you're not careful.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't like what happened to you, Juliette.
Are you really telling me that this... is how we want to introduce her to the world?<eos> Look, "Who I Love" is a terrific song.<eos> But it's not the right song for her.<eos> - I mean, Hallie has something unique... - Thanks!<eos> And she deserves to share it with the world.<eos> If she fails on her own merit, so be it.<eos> That's the album I want for Highway 65.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> - Is it true?<eos> - We're so excited for you!
Avery called me this morning, and told me everything.<eos> We start recording today.<eos> Wow!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Is it something I said? No.<eos> Come on,<eos> I just wanted to be the first to tell you.<eos> We've been through so much together. I was hoping that I'd get to tell you the amazing news.<eos> Thank you.<eos> None of this would have been possible without you.
Baby girl, this is all you.<eos> Don't ever feel like your career depends on anybody else.<eos> I also heard about George from Avery.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, if you ever want to talk, I'm always here to listen.<eos> Life is crazy.<eos> The highs are so high. The lows are so low.<eos> I think I know what you're talking about.<eos> Tell me about that stunning performance on the music video.<eos> Honestly, it's kind of terrifying when... somebody sees something in you you didn't even know existed.
It wasn't very much fun, I can tell you that. Hmm?<eos> How so?<eos> Oh, it's not worth going into.<eos> I was going through a rough time.<eos> And Damien pulled out all that madness and passion from me.<eos> In a way, he set me free.<eos> Well, that's Damien for you.<eos> You know him?<eos> You could say that, yeah.<eos> I could trust you.
- Oh my God, you did. You did!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - No, I mean, the handsome and charming bit. - You did!<eos> You did too.<eos> No, I wouldn't talk about it in this setting.<eos> Honey, we've gotten so far off topic.<eos> I'm the one that's sitting here completely exposed.<eos> No, I didn't have an affair. I don't...<eos> I can't go behind peoples' backs, so no.<eos> Well, good for you.
You were right about Hallie.<eos> She has an amazing instrument.<eos> I mean, her control, her range, everything, my God!<eos> I know her a lot better than you realize.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - You wanna know what it means?<eos> It means that sometimes we get so caught up in someone, we don't see that someone is very different than what we thought.<eos> Am I missing something here?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I would be very careful if I were you.
- Nothing?<eos> Just because you're younger?<eos> - All right. Take it down.<eos> Just... No!<eos> I want you to stop being a bitch about it!<eos> - Daphne!<eos> - She is!<eos> - Don't talk like that!<eos> - You only care about yourself!<eos> Liv was so right about you.
Daphne, stop!<eos> - You don't listen to me!<eos> - I'm going out for a while.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No.<eos> Well, remember, Louise's mom is gonna pick you up at 11, all right?<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, girl.
But you hurt me really badly, and I understand.<eos> Everybody keeps talking about all the great things happening to me. And I should be happy. You know, I should be grateful.<eos> And making the most of this moment.<eos> But I just miss Mom!<eos> Every day, every hour, I just want Mom.<eos> And she's not here!<eos> I don't know what to do about it.<eos> Me too.<eos> I couldn't possibly lose you, Daphne.<eos> I need you too much.

- talking about me like that.<eos> - By opening my eyes!<eos> - No, Hallie, don't leave like this.<eos> - You know what?<eos> The craziest thing about this is that this isn't even about me.<eos> You got problems?<eos> Lord knows we all do.<eos> But you don't take them out on the people who love you.<eos> What... why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I'm literally worried about you at this moment.
What... why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I'm literally worried about you at this moment.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go, not with her.<eos> And I want you to think really hard about what just happened.<eos> She lives here?<eos> Until the cops kick them out.<eos> Look who's here.<eos> I didn't think I'd see you again.<eos> I was hoping that I wouldn't see you again.

Hi, there.<eos> Hey, Scarlett. How are you?<eos> Oh, hanging in there or pretending to hang in there.<eos> Zach told me you were the one to fix all this.<eos> Well, I am going to try.<eos> Actually, you must feel awful.<eos> Well, my fans hate me.<eos> Well, like literally hate me.<eos> They don't hate you, okay?<eos> They had a fantasy about you.
Just for the people that love you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> So your truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere.<eos> You trudge down a deserted two-lane blacktop.<eos> And you come to a town.<eos> You're thirsty and you come to a saloon.<eos> Which is filled with some of the meanest-looking characters you ever saw.<eos> And they don't like you.<eos> What's gonna happen?<eos> Then the meanest-looking guy in the bar takes a bottle of Bud, and slides it all the way down to you while all the mean guys watch.

And smack each other on the back.<eos> And they've decided right there:<eos> We like Will Lexington!<eos> Our research shows that straight men like you, they want to have a beer with you.
♪ No wandering this time ♪<eos> ♪ I'd draw a straight line ♪<eos> ♪ As the crow flies ♪<eos> ♪ As the crow flies ♪<eos> - Thank you guys.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> (giggles) There you go.<eos> I'll see you next time. Thank you.<eos> Hey, I remember you.
Thank you.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> (giggles) There you go.<eos> I'll see you next time. Thank you.<eos> Hey, I remember you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do. I signed your cast.<eos> You got a real pretty name.<eos> Nadine, right? Yeah.<eos> Must be something about you, because I'm terrible with names.
Don't say what.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Wait, because of me?<eos> Are you seriously asking that?<eos> I voiced my opinion. You can make your own choices.<eos> You didn't voice your opinion. You went insane.<eos> You made utterly paranoid accusations of both of us.<eos> If you already made that decision, then you must have agreed with something I said.<eos> No, Juliette.<eos> I made that decision because things can only go one way with you.
Well, it's just time for them to realize that not everybody's perfect.<eos> I never said I was.<eos> The problem is, your article made it seem like I had something to be ashamed of.<eos> And girls have enough shame heaped onto them every day without somebody in your position making it so much worse.<eos> I don't know what kind of world you live in.<eos> I'm sure it's a really nice one, and I'm sorry if I rocked it.<eos> But this has nothing to do with shame.<eos> In my world, if there's a scoop, I publish it.<eos> Or I'm not doing my job.<eos> I feel sorry for you.
Okay.<eos> You seem officially weird.<eos> I need to ask you something.<eos> Okay, but you do know people are coming, right?<eos> Who else is there?<eos> You mean who else will be here?<eos> Are you seeing other guys?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> What would give you that idea?
Welcome, everybody!<eos> Good to see you all.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> My girls.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How y'all doing today?<eos> - We're starving.<eos> Well, you should probably fix yourself something, huh?<eos> We don't want to make something.<eos> We want something already made, like, by you!
I refuse to watch "Love Actually" ever again.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna head up and do some work in the music room.<eos> Let me know if anybody needs to go to the hospital, you know. (laughing) 'Kay.<eos> Hey, Deacon, it's Jessie Caine.<eos> Just wanted to say thank you for a really lovely and unexpected afternoon.<eos> You were really kind to listen.<eos> So, any rate...<eos> I mean, at any rate... (laughs) I just wanted to say that<eos> I would really like to work with you.
or you and Zach could come.<eos> So I hope to see you.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, why did you want to hang out with me?<eos> Well, because last time I saw you, you were so upset.<eos> So I figured maybe we weren't done talking.<eos> Yeah, but I'm just a stupid fan.<eos> - You are you.<eos> - You are not stupid.<eos> And I'm just a person like you.
Yeah, but you're delicate and beautiful.<eos> So are you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay?<eos> Honestly, firstly, it took me a really long time to see anything beautiful about myself at all.<eos> And, secondly, pretty goes away.<eos> In the end, it doesn't mean a damn thing.<eos> Yeah, but it's easy for you to say.<eos> I mean, you don't have people calling you horrible names every day for the way you look.<eos> - When I listen to your music and I read about you and Gunnar, it allows me to not have to be myself for a minute.

It's what it is, it's who she was to a T.<eos> Seriously, I wish, you know, you could have met her.<eos> She was just...<eos> - What's so funny? What? - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Some people would say it was rude that you're kind of laughing while I'm...<eos> I'm not laughing. Not laughing.<eos> Smiling.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> It's just, now I understand why every woman over the age of 33 gets all goo-goo eyed when I say that I'm working with you.
It's like you're out of some novel or something.<eos> Okay, stop that.<eos> A handsome widower still married to his grief?<eos> It's like the plot of every pulp romance<eos> - since "Wuthering Heights."<eos> - You're just trying to... embarrass me now or something, right?<eos> It's true. (Clears throat)<eos> Speaking of which, how did your meeting go with Jessie Caine?<eos> Speaking of what?<eos> Women who have crushes on you? No.
I was too mad.<eos> Scarlett, what are you doing?<eos> You're just making it worse by engaging her.<eos> I know it's stupid. I just...<eos> I can't stop thinking about Nadine.<eos> The fan girl? Ex-fan girl.<eos> Okay, Scarlett, look.<eos> They don't know who you are, like, really.<eos> And you're allowing yourself to get all wrapped up in this.<eos> It's almost as unhealthy as what they're doing to you.
So I guess I'll just see you around.<eos> Jessie, hold on.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, yeah, bye.<eos> You've reached Mackenzie Rhodes.<eos> - Leave a message. - (beep)<eos> Hi, Mackenzie, it's Scarlett.<eos> You're probably screening this call, which makes a lot of sense.<eos> I just wanted to let you know I'm not angry at you anymore.
Juliette, I'm not... I'm not breaking up with you. It's a tour.<eos> You can't just leave us!<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Juliette, you're gonna be fine.<eos> You have the resources to handle everything.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> I don't want you to leave.<eos> I need you to listen to me right now, okay?<eos> I have been taking care of everyone for a long time.<eos> Taking care of you and putting myself aside.

You said this happened to you twice?<eos> Once when I was 20.<eos> And then again, when my husband and I were trying to start a family, and... it was so hard and lonely.<eos> I guess I just hated the idea of somebody else feeling that way.<eos> But I truly did not mean to bother you.<eos> You want to come in?<eos> So I fall back and I instantly know I'm gonna be the guy who died trying to crowd surf.<eos> But they caught me, thank God.<eos> I'm just jealous of the folks who got to put their hands all over you.<eos> I wish I could be there to celebrate you tonight.

- And it took a really long time.<eos> But I do think that I had to forgive myself before I could actually start grieving.<eos> I got no memories.<eos> I never even got to tell her her name.<eos> All I got is the blanket they wrapped her in when they handed her to me, because I asked to see her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, don't say sorry.<eos> I get it.<eos> And, I don't know, it's hard to know how to say goodbye to somebody that you've never met.<eos> And I wish that there was some magic words of wisdom that I could share with you.
She came out. We got to talking.<eos> I get it, yeah.<eos> So you think I shouldn't have come.<eos> - Didn't say that.<eos> - But...<eos> You don't think she might have felt a little invaded or angry over that at all?<eos> She wasn't supposed to see me.<eos> Yeah, well, you left something, A.<eos> - And, B, she did see you, so... - Okay. Well, I don't think that she would have invited me in if she were angry.<eos> I'm not talking about her being angry with you, Jessie. I'm talking about her being angry with me, for sharing her private business with a complete stranger.
- Maddie Jaymes?<eos> - Travis Stroud.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, my gosh, so nice to meet you.<eos> You have written some of my favorite songs.<eos> Well, as long as you keep flattering me, I guess I can forgive you for passing on this one. - Wait.<eos> Sorry. What?<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> J said it didn't light your fire... I get it.<eos> I'd love to work with you one of these days, though.
Maddie, please, can we just talk about this outside?<eos> No!<eos> There's nothing to talk about, liar.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thought you needed to be alone.<eos> I did...<eos> I do, but I know you're hurting too, and you didn't answer phone,<eos> I just had to come and see if you were okay.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> All I want to do is be there for you, Scarlett.

And I need to know why?<eos> Why won't you let me take care of you?
How am I supposed to be okay when it's my fault?<eos> Hey, hey, Gunnar.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You look at me.<eos> It was not your fault.<eos> It was not.<eos> It just happened.<eos> What about us?<eos> Not my fault, but that just happened?<eos> I know this has been really hard on you.
Look at me.<eos> You look at me.<eos> It was not your fault.<eos> It was not.<eos> It just happened.<eos> What about us?<eos> Not my fault, but that just happened?<eos> I know this has been really hard on you.<eos> Being pregnant made me question everything about my future.<eos> Suddenly I was thinking about spending the rest of my life with you. And raising a family together.
Hey.<eos> Hey, man. Where are you now?<eos> Uh, New Orleans.<eos> It's been a blast.<eos> Heading to Texas.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> How's everything?<eos> How's it going?<eos> Sorry dude, Will asked you to call, didn't he?<eos> Well, he's worried about you.
Figured I should come and get some of my stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can not be here if you prefer.<eos> You can be here.<eos> Oh, I did want to ask you.<eos> I was thinking I might actually would like to do the fundraiser.<eos> But I know we haven't talked about how we're gonna do shows.<eos> And I didn't want you to feel like you had to...<eos> You should do it.<eos> Without you?

Hey, the first leg is only two weeks...<eos> Two weeks?<eos> She could be doing calculus in two weeks.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Just promise me you won't let her do anything new while I'm gone, okay?<eos> And if she does, I want it recorded from multiple angles.<eos> Okay, as long as you promise to stay on the straight and narrow.<eos> My God, you're confusing me with my younger self.<eos> The tour's gonna go great.<eos> - I'm proud of you.
Seriously...<eos> You're not a food critic, are you?<eos> Because our chef is on vacation.<eos> No. My band's opening for Dierks Bentley tonight.<eos> No way.<eos> I love Dierks Bentley!<eos> - All my friends are going.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, why aren't you?<eos> Because I'm stuck here serving people like you.
You do?<eos> Yes, terribly.<eos> How can I miss you this much after one day?<eos> I miss you too.<eos> Why'd you have to leave?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought that I missed the old me.<eos> And then when I got here, I realized that that's not really me anymore.<eos> You know, I like the new me better.<eos> The one that has you and Cadence in his life.
I was gonna do something else, but this seems maybe a little more appropriate, and uh...<eos> This is for Rayna.<eos> ♪ I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore ♪<eos> ♪ And maybe I've learned this time ♪<eos> ♪ I hope that I find what I'm reaching for ♪<eos> ♪ The way that it is in my mind ♪<eos> ♪ Someday I'll get over you ♪<eos> ♪ I'll live to see it all through ♪<eos> ♪ But I'll always miss ♪<eos> ♪ Dreaming my dreams with you ♪

What, almost three decades?<eos> I need to be able to exist here, by myself, and be just fine. And apparently I can't do that, so.<eos> Well, maybe you should try taking a selfdefense class.<eos> This girl at the studio has been raving. About this course she took.<eos> She says she used to be afraid to, like, Jog around her park after dark.<eos> And now she's like got this whole new outlook on it. Wow.<eos> Look at you with the wisdom.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Seems like something all women should do.<eos> This whole media narrative about you and maddie. Being in the middle of some sort of catfight isn't going away.
Dad?<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> Regardless.<eos> So we should talk about what we're going to eat. Yeah.<eos> Well, we started 6th grade here, 18 years ago.<eos> It's funny how we've known each other for that long. But never had a conversation as real as this one.<eos> Yeah, well, you were always part of the cool crowd, so. No, I wasn't.<eos> You absolutely were.<eos> I mean, it's not like you were mean or anything. But you just had this... This force field around you.
You lost your parents gunnar.<eos> It's not a small thing.<eos> Kelly, I... i just don't want to talk about it right now.<eos> Jill scott, obviously you knew her better than I did.<eos> But I crossed paths with her enough times. In the drug store to get a sense...<eos> I mean, it's not like she hit me or anything.<eos> Just because nobody hit you. Doesn't mean you don't have scars.<eos> You're all alone.<eos> You were too young for something like that.<eos> You know, when I used to see you. All alone, looking lost. I never really worried about you.
I know it was bad circumstances for everyone.<eos> You didn't want to raise two more boys. And you were grieving too.<eos> But I was 11 years old.<eos> And I felt like if I walked out of that house. And never came back, you wouldn't even notice me. Let alone miss me.<eos> I guess what I'm trying to say. Is that sometimes it's... it's hard to believe in yourself. When no one else ever did.<eos> And I know it's 18 years later and...<eos> Nothing's going to change that. And I should probably just move on. But I just... i needed to say that to you.<eos> I raised you the best I knew how to.<eos> You know, you never cared to hear it when I was younger, So I don't know what the difference will be now. But I became a damn good musician.<eos> I'm going to play something for you. That I wrote last night.
That's the suit. I literally cannot breathe.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> Your first song is in a commercial.<eos> Think about how many people are going to hear it.<eos> - Yeah... ow!<eos> - Great dress!<eos> God, look at your hair!<eos> Cooper?<eos> Leslie? Miss Maddie Jaymes.<eos> - These are for you.
- We're going!<eos> - We're back on the map!<eos> All right, we're on the map.<eos> We're going. And so are you, I hear.<eos> What's this about you playing the Opry?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I might play the Opry.<eos> Dude, you should.<eos> I mean, you're being featured, man.<eos> I think this would be a great thing for you.
Isn't she? Perfect girl.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Just really tired.<eos> Yeah, well, just hang in there.<eos> I'll get you out soon, girl.<eos> I'd like to say that we are incredibly thrilled to have the young Maddie Jaymes as the face of Mascara 24.<eos> We hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.<eos> Welcome to the family, Maddie. - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, Maddie!<eos> The CEO came out just for you.
I mean, it's amazing. It's really amazing. I just don't know when I'm gonna find the time or brain cells to even rehearse for it, so...<eos> Hey, listen, if this is keeping you from any of that,<eos> - I really don't want...<eos> - No, please.<eos> This, I know what I'm doing. Highway 65, not so much.<eos> That has been a recurring thing ever since...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I keep telling myself I'm doing it for the girls and for the artists, but... in the end, I just wish I could talk to her, you know, like we used to.<eos> All right, let's get back to it.<eos> Well, I'm happy for you.
But they want my song.<eos> The song... it literally came from the bottom of my heart!<eos> Every single note was a piece of me.<eos> And you more than anyone should understand that, Dad!<eos> I do, baby.<eos> I actually do.<eos> Deacon!<eos> Just the man I wanted to see.<eos> Good, because we got to talk about this damn commercial.<eos> I realize this is a difficult situation for you.
- This is not... how any of this was pitched by you.<eos> You never really believed that I have Highway 65's best interest at heart, have you?<eos> Oh, my God, I supported you, Zach.<eos> Even when I didn't understand you.<eos> - Only because Rayna wanted you to.<eos> - That's true.<eos> What the hell does that have to do with right now?<eos> I'm so tired!<eos> I've done everything I can to keep this company going! And all anyone ever does is give me a hard time!<eos> And I've never held this over you, Deacon, but...
- It's cool man, you can take it.<eos> - Nah, just gonna be another fight.<eos> Yep. Being gone sure does shake stuff up.<eos> Maybe that's a good thing.<eos> Sometimes it can help you see things more clearly.<eos> Yeah, like all the stuff you did wrong?<eos> Yeah, or how hard it is?<eos> Geez, you guys... you got to trust that your partners can take care of themselves.<eos> You don't always have to solve every single thing for them.<eos> Yeah, but relationships are about being there when they need you.
So I'm supposed to pick and choose the times I'm there for her?<eos> I think I'm gonna head back to the hotel.<eos> If you need me for anything, I'm gonna be at the bar.<eos> Whoa.<eos> What do you mean, whoa?<eos> What do you mean, what do I mean?<eos> It's obvious. - No way.<eos> - Yes, way.<eos> She's, you know, into being happy.<eos> She was looking at you.

That's beautiful, sweetheart.<eos> And there's a whole lot of truth to it. It's just... I'm afraid it's not that simple.<eos> Why isn't it?<eos> What's the point of Highway 65 if it isn't what Mom wanted it to be?<eos> Rayna signed us 'cause she loved our songs. Not 'cause she saw dollar signs.<eos> You're who Rayna trusted to steer this company, Deacon.<eos> So it's gotta be your decision, not ours.<eos> - I agree.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Whatever you decide, we're with you.
Nothing could ever make us do that.<eos> I know that.<eos> I love you. I know that too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> I didn't really do anything.<eos> You always listen to me.<eos> Even when I'm being full of myself or difficult.<eos> You still listen.<eos> I'm really lucky to have you.
Come over here. Don't you cry.<eos> Come on, you did not do anything wrong, okay?<eos> - No, Dad...<eos> - Listen to me. You did what you felt was right in your heart as an artist.<eos> And that is exactly what I should have done.<eos> And it's what your mama wanted us all to do at Highway 65.<eos> So don't cry.<eos> Well, thank you, but that's really not why I'm crying.<eos> Then why are you crying?<eos> Mom would have been so proud of you, Dad.
Previously on Nashville.<eos> Mom would have been so proud of you, Dad.
It's not for sale.<eos> It will be if "Zacherberg" leaves.<eos> You'd run it the same way you do every day.<eos> Just under the Shiny New Records umbrella.<eos> You wouldn't even know I exist.<eos> You forgive me if I have trouble believing that.<eos> Deacon, I've never known you to be a patsy.<eos> Come on, here you are, at the helm of a sinking ship just watching every label in town just pick apart her dream like vultures on a carcass.<eos> We done here?<eos> I just want what's best for you. Why would you want that?

- I know.<eos> Jessie?<eos> Deacon?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just leaving.<eos> This is my son, Jake.<eos> This is my good friend, Deacon Claybourne.<eos> Nice to meet you, Jake.<eos> Give me a sec?<eos> Mom, I just want to stay with you.
What song?<eos> What do you mean, stole?<eos> Travis Stroud gave it to Juliette to give it to Maddie. And she never did.<eos> She recorded it for herself.<eos> Why didn't she tell me?<eos> She knew you'd be mad.<eos> She's right.<eos> You ain't gonna outrun me!<eos> Not in those heels.<eos> I don't know why she didn't tell you sooner.
I can't even explain it to myself.<eos> How far do we go back, you and me?<eos> That's my daughter, Juliette, who just happens to love you. And you do this?<eos> We're supposed to be family!<eos> It was a horrible mistake!<eos> I tried to apologize, but I know that doesn't mean anything!<eos> How can I make this right?<eos> You can't.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna keep battling for Highway 65. But not for you.
What are you proposing?<eos> A multiplatform media company.<eos> Why should we get only half the tour money?<eos> Why not own the tour?<eos> Own the content?<eos> Own every exploitation of every artist brand?<eos> Why not own a network?<eos> Think we can't do better than CMT?<eos> Dance girl!<eos> I miss playing with you.
I don't need you to carry me in this relationship. Okay.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I can't believe Maddie got nominated for an American Music Award.<eos> I wish I had your family.<eos> The only thing my sister gets nominated for is bitch of the century.<eos> I'm so not going swimming.<eos> Me either.<eos> How do I look?<eos> - Like you're 25. - Perfect.<eos> Now you.
So I told Chad we should break up.<eos> He's just totally lame and uncool.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, have you seen Daphne?<eos> No.<eos> Do you want to see who can hold their breath the longest?<eos> What?<eos> Daph, relax.<eos> They're just friends.<eos> I'll go first, and then you. Count.
She said I was constantly in relationships even back then.<eos> It's a real problem. But I'm willing to work on it.<eos> You spend time with this person?<eos> Yeah, she helped me figure out a few...<eos> What?<eos> I hope one day for your sake you can figure out how to search your soul on your own.<eos> Um, why couldn't my dad pick me up?<eos> There was a lawyer coming over to go through stuff with him. And I thought I'd help him out.<eos> Did you guys have fun?<eos> Jakey, how was the party for you?
You should be doing the same.<eos> I'm looking out for the people I care about, Alyssa.<eos> You know the difference between you and me?<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't live in some fantasy world where I think artistic integrity comes without a price.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should head back to computer valley where you don't have to worry about those things.<eos> Why are you so impossible?<eos> Because I believe in something, maybe?<eos> Is that why?<eos> No, because you don't know what's good for you!
Okay, I'm not doing this now, not here.<eos> Me? Caleb?<eos> Even Avery?<eos> Who's been good enough?<eos> Scarlett, you never completely let anybody in your life.<eos> You find faults and you pick apart all the people who love you.<eos> And that's... that's on you.<eos> It's time you realized not everything is my fault.<eos> Because... I'm done trying.<eos> I'm done trying with you, Scarlett.
You gave me all this information. I can't print it.<eos> Don't worry, you will be very happy with the story you can print.<eos> We can expect the major portion of the storms to hit Albuquerque overnight...<eos> Storm provisions, or apology sandwiches.<eos> - Whichever you prefer.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You're entitled to whatever life you choose. And I have no right to project my beliefs onto you.
The party was stupid?<eos> No, it just... reminded me of how complicated eighth grade's gonna be.<eos> Yeah, well, truth is, life's just complicated in general, you know?<eos> But we roll with it.<eos> The joy and the pain.<eos> Why did Jessie pick me up from the party?<eos> I had to meet with a lawyer.<eos> It wasn't anything really. She was just, you know, doing me a favor.<eos> Is she gonna be like around?<eos> Sweetheart, I got you, and I've got your sister.
There's always a reason.<eos> And can I ask what the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> What?<eos> Okay, look, I get it.<eos> We all get it. You don't want children.<eos> Doesn't mean you get to be shitty about mine.<eos> - Mal, I was joking.<eos> - No, it's not funny.<eos> It used to be sort of amusing, like, "Oh, that's just you," but now it's just mean.<eos> And I'm starting to think there's something really, truly wrong with you.
Okay.<eos> While you were out, Peter stopped by...<eos> You slept with Peter? !<eos> I did not sleep with Peter.<eos> I didn't sleep with anyone.<eos> Peter left some disappointing news.<eos> Oh... We didn't get cast, did we?<eos> Well, actually, I got cast... in a lead role of John Adams.<eos> That's amazing!<eos> I am so proud of you!
That there's something wrong with me. Like I'm broken or something.<eos> - Mommy?<eos> Why so quiet?<eos> - I'm avoiding land mines.<eos> - Wait. You think there's something wrong with me?<eos> Look, why don't you try pretending that you adore those kids?<eos> That you think they're the cutest things in the world.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Because Mallory is a mother with a tribe of children.<eos> She's not the younger sister who used to stay up with you and braid your hair and talk about boys.
I just miss my sister.<eos> I miss my sister, too.<eos> You just wait.<eos> I mean, I'm going to pass along everything that Frankie taught me.<eos> How to roll a tight joint.<eos> Steer a car only using your feet.<eos> Read aloud from Henry Miller.<eos> - Classy.<eos> - Just the dirty stuff.<eos> My children are not to go near you.
I call middle.<eos> Oh, you've got to be kidding.<eos> Oh, would you rather us both sleep in my studio?<eos> Cool with me, though there is a bit of unaccounted-for vindaloo somewhere in my bed.<eos> No.<eos> I will sleep in my bed.<eos> You will sleep with the Indian food, like always.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> I sleep with you and you let me.
I don't know.<eos> I can't stop thinking about how vulnerable we are.<eos> - Doesn't it bother you?<eos> - Honestly?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Well, I decidedly am not.<eos> I haven't felt this way... maybe ever.<eos> Please, Grace, let me stay here for one night.<eos> - I need you.
She started a relationship with a new man.<eos> A farmer, no less.<eos> I do rock his world.<eos> She started a business in her 70s, for Christ's sake.<eos> I did all those things.<eos> You're damn right you did.<eos> And you know what all those victories have in common?<eos> A series of lost purses?<eos> You.<eos> I couldn't have done any of that without you.
I apologize, they've got a picture of somebody called "André the Giant" on them.<eos> Can you believe what he did to King Kong Bundy at the "Colossal Jostle" back in '85?<eos> Well, I'm not a basketball fan, I'm afraid.<eos> Look.<eos> A special channel so that you can always reach me any time, day or night.<eos> - It's short-wave.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So we never have to be far apart from each other.<eos> Frankie, I'm going to get you through this.<eos> I will always be here for you. I just can't be here for you.
- How do you feel?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I just know that I feel shitty about all the years I pretended I wasn't gay and what that did to all the people that I love.<eos> And now they know that that's the kind of coward that I am.<eos> But that's what happened.<eos> And we can't pretend it didn't.<eos> I know we can't, but do you have to discuss it with the whole world?<eos> No, but we shouldn't hide it, either.<eos> Personally, I'm done with being in any kind of closet.<eos> This is between you and you.
Selfishly, I... could hardly wait to meet you, but I thought I'd let you rest.<eos> I see you found the kitchen.<eos> I hope you're not still hungry.<eos> How about a drink?<eos> Can I get you something?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're in my home.<eos> You're my guest.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
No.<eos> I won't put you at risk.<eos> First Celeste, then Holden.<eos> I won't lose you too.<eos> There's always been risk.<eos> Why are you giving up now?<eos> You're not afraid of losing me.<eos> You're afraid of losing.<eos> To Frost.<eos> It's always been about you and Frost.
For years, I've sent people in.<eos> Willing participants in what someday will be considered... the greatest scientific and religious expedition in human history.<eos> Those who ventured far enough glimpse what they describe as a spectacular sea of light.<eos> And an archway... like a grand entrance leading out... into the great beyond.<eos> A bridge to the afterlife.<eos> Now you and I can take that next step together.<eos> Why me?<eos> You said you sent others in.<eos> They all came back damaged.<eos> But not you.
Isaac.<eos> I think you've got the wrong idea.<eos> How so?<eos> You're right.<eos> I've seen what's out there.<eos> But the Realm is violent.<eos> It's unrelenting and it doesn't want us there.<eos> I spent all those years surviving.<eos> I'm not going through that again.<eos> Certainly not for you.
Besides, you're the science nerd.<eos> Can't you just... you know, science your way out of here?<eos> Science our way out of here?<eos> You know, like when you supercharged our toaster because you couldn't wait 10 minutes for Bagel Bites?<eos> Well, you remember that. You cut off power for the entire block.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> I'm gonna science our way out of here.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Willa.<eos> I'm surprised you remembered my name... or did she have to remind you?
Celeste.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> So... why now, after all these years?<eos> You have something I want.<eos> If it's an apology, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.<eos> I found out you're my father.<eos> I'm used to disappointment.<eos> You have to understand that what I did was the best thing for both of us.<eos> You got to live your life.<eos> And I want to continue living my life without you in it.
I owe you nothing.<eos> You want Holden to get you to the Ocean of Light.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm the one who showed him how to get there.<eos> Arthur raised me to be more than his granddaughter.<eos> We got to Holden first.<eos> We were in the Realm with him.<eos> Been there too.<eos> I can take you where you want to go.<eos> Why should I trust you?
Get her out.<eos> It's too late.<eos> She volunteered to take your place.<eos> She must like you a lot.<eos> Now the only question is what are you willing to do for her?<eos> 26 years ago, I lost the only woman I ever loved.<eos> Before she left, she gave me a message.<eos> She's in there.<eos> Waiting for me on the other side of the bridge.<eos> Willa's waiting for you, too.
And I think I put my ideals ahead of my family.<eos> Admitting our sins is always difficult.<eos> But taking responsibility for them is a different matter.<eos> I'll take responsibility for everything I've done.<eos> I don't want it to land on my daughter.<eos> [sniffles] We're alone.<eos> You have family in the bloc, don't you?<eos> That hasn't been easy either.<eos> It's been my experience that blood will always rise to the occasion if you give it the chance.<eos> You just have to ask yourself what matters most to you:
You don't look fine. I know who jumped you, took your boots.<eos> Who?<eos> ♪ You can't let him get away with stealing your shit.<eos> This place will eat you alive.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you two getting along?<eos> Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened?<eos> ♪ Solomon won't be bothering you or any of your friends again.
How are you two getting along?<eos> Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened?<eos> ♪ Solomon won't be bothering you or any of your friends again.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> Solomon has business partners. As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us.<eos> We'd better go, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm coming with you.
Maybe ten minutes.<eos> Keep your eyes peeled.<eos> Stick together.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You good? I can get your bag.<eos> - I got it.<eos> Tough kid.<eos> I don't know where he gets it.<eos> From his mom, probably.<eos> So, what's going on with you and Katie?
All right, everybody back.<eos> She's hot.<eos> All right, we're rigged.<eos> Better get climbing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Remember, unclip, clip, every knot.<eos> Unclip, clip, every knot.<eos> Let's see what you got now.<eos> I've climbed worse than this.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
You have kids?<eos> Nope.<eos> A pair of nieces in Texas.<eos> Or they... were.<eos> Sure.<eos> [clears throat] I meant what I said.<eos> You're out of time. You need to deliver.<eos> I'm gonna take my daughter up to my sister's place in the Green Zone.<eos> You can come, if you want.<eos> And then I'll walk into Homeland with you.
I won't blame you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I won't blame you.<eos> Gracie-girl, got to go!<eos> [sighs, sniffles] What's going on?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's like we talked about last night.<eos> You're gonna get to go up to the Green Zone with your Auntie Maddie and with your cousin. Grab your bag.<eos> Mom, I don't want to go to the Green Zone.<eos> I want to stay here with you.
What the fuck?<eos> ! What the fuck? !<eos> What the fuck? ! You've got a gun?<eos> You've got a you!
You think coming out to her is going to make you feel better?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> When has that woman ever made you feel better about anything?<eos> Does she still refer to me as "the loud, tall Jew at the law firm"?<eos> Only to distinguish you from the "slender, black one."<eos> She's never going to give you what you want.<eos> She's not capable of it.<eos> Sol, I know what she's like.<eos> I'm not expecting her to suddenly sprout a new personality.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Yes, it does.<eos> I am gay.<eos> And a man named Sol Bergstein is the love of my life.<eos> And now I'm lucky enough to call him my husband.<eos> I probably should have started with the "I'm gay" thing, but I thought if I... mentioned the "I married a man" thing it would clue you right in.<eos> Aren't you going to say anything?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> You know... You're happy for me?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm happy for you.
I'll call you back.<eos> Or you call me back.<eos> - Sorry about that, Frankie.<eos> - It's the other one.<eos> Hi, Grace.<eos> Robert's not here.<eos> He drove up north to visit Cruella de Vil.<eos> She's your mother-in-law now. Enjoy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, I'm calling for you.
When was the last time she checked in?<eos> She, um... she hasn't checked in.<eos> Huh. I mean, she once checked in from the back of a minivan I was driving.<eos> I know.<eos> - Did something happen?<eos> - We had a fight.<eos> I mean, nothing crazy, but just our usual odd couple shenanigans.<eos> She seemed especially heated, though.<eos> Must have been.<eos> She didn't even call me to complain about you.
And your solution was to have him quit the track team?<eos> Wow.<eos> That explains so much.<eos> To be honest, he was getting a lot of participation ribbons, too.<eos> Judases!<eos> Frankie, thank God.<eos> The two great betrayers.<eos> Are you having a betrayer's dinner?<eos> Do you have a club?<eos> We were worried about you!
She took it far better than I expected.<eos> Sends her love to you.<eos> Said she's sorry about all the awful things she said about Grace and Bill Clinton.<eos> I think she's knitting us a wedding blanket as we speak.<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Hey, it's what it is.<eos> For what it's worth, I'm proud of you.
Second of all, you went behind my back to my daughter!<eos> I don't know what your problem is.<eos> I wouldn't be mad at you if you went to Coyote.<eos> So he could write one of his homemade checks?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sick of you saying terrible things about my kids.<eos> I'm sick of you telling me what I'm allowed to pitch at the incubator and what time I have to have breakfast and whether or not there's a gun in my house!<eos> I'm sick of all of it!<eos> I'm sick of you.
Previously on Colony...<eos> I just need to find a way out of here.<eos> We could use a coyote.<eos> Let's go!<eos> The art of deception is a natural talent, and your wife has it in spades.<eos> How long you been spying on me, selling me out?<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> Bullshit. You did it for you.
It's just protocol. - Protocol?<eos> You know, I have a background in internal affairs, and it's led me to trust my instincts, and something here...<eos> it doesn't smell right. So I'm going to dig... and if I find something, you're going to the Factory.<eos> Wh...<eos> Because concealing a crime is as bad as participating.<eos> Think about that before we talk again.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Stockpiling food.<eos> We got to get him to open up, Will.<eos> He'll talk to you.
It haunts me.<eos> Did it haunt you while you were doing it or just now that you've been caught?<eos> I was trying to do something... something bigger than me, than us.<eos> The cell started to fall apart, and... and I asked...<eos> I know.<eos> Quayle came to me and was ready to give up the whole damn cell to save his own ass...<eos> Broussard, you.<eos> He didn't even blink.<eos> So I killed him.<eos> He was unarmed, and I executed him... for you.
- I think you should be there.<eos> - Okay, I'll try.<eos> Noah?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm sorry to have scared you.<eos> Honestly, I wasn't scared.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was hoping that this wouldn't be so complicated.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Dad left it to you.
Fuck.<eos> Are you sure she's gonna make it?<eos> Yeah, she's just running late.<eos> How long have you been dating this woman?<eos> On and off for a while now.<eos> How come you've never mentioned her?<eos> Well, I know how sensitive you are, darling.<eos> I wouldn't want you to be heartbroken if it didn't work out between us.<eos> So what's she like?<eos> You know, she's... a lot like you.
So what's she like?<eos> You know, she's... a lot like you.<eos> Like me?<eos> Hello, darling.<eos> Mom?<eos> Surprise.<eos> Okay, what is happening here?<eos> We're back together.<eos> Well, it's... it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.<eos> We've heard so much about you.
Congrats on your remarriage.<eos> Okay, you're not actually getting remarried, are you?<eos> Well, we never really finalized the divorce.<eos> Okay, well, when did you even start talking?<eos> Let's not discuss the details.<eos> Ina left me, and, I went back to your mom.<eos> Aren't you happy for us, Helen?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> Well, I'm thrilled for you, darling.
Right.<eos> After all those years together... Yet... wow.<eos> Yet what?<eos> It's... it's actually... it's funny.<eos> It really is.<eos> I could never figure out if you were purposely ignoring who he actually was or you were just so narcissistic that you weren't paying attention.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My brother was shattered when you met him.<eos> Our mother had just died, and I don't know if you know, but...<eos> You know, maybe he hid it really well from you.
Hi, Max.<eos> I can't believe it. So just...<eos> what, you decided to...<eos> I mean, I was in the neighborhood, and I-I just... I remembered that you lived here, so I thought I would just take a chance, say hi.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Let me take your stuff.<eos> Can I get you glass of wine?<eos> Um... no, I really shouldn't.<eos> I mean, the kids are home, and it's a school night, and I-I just was gonna come by for a minute and say hi.<eos> Yeah, I'm just gonna pour you a glass of wine.
You're never home this late.<eos> I was showing an apartment.<eos> It took forever.<eos> People don't know what they want.<eos> Well... it's nice to see you.<eos> Hey, what time did Martin get home?<eos> Martin?<eos> He's not home yet.<eos> He's not home yet?<eos> I thought maybe he was with you.
- Yeah.<eos> I don't know your kids?<eos> I'm not here with them every day?<eos> You know, running lines with Trevor, helping Martin with his chem, picking Stacey up from fucking art class?<eos> Tell me, Helen.<eos> Tell me, how have I failed you?<eos> Martin.<eos> Martin!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Hey, we were worried about you, buddy.
Look, Ma, I'm really tired.<eos> Let's just talk about this tomorrow.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> So you...<eos> Um... you managed to get yourself to Pennsylvania and Dad was there?<eos> Yes, that's what I said.<eos> What was he doing there?<eos> I can't tell you.
You can't go back to your apartment. It's a crime scene.<eos> Have you spoken to the detectives?<eos> Yeah, this morning.<eos> Do they have any other leads besides me?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> You're not worried, are you?<eos> About me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm a little worried about you, but I promised myself I wouldn't ask you any questions, so...
I'm sorry.<eos> You fucking hate this place!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.<eos> To you?<eos> Not to Nina?<eos> To me.<eos> I came here to be alone.<eos> Grandpa said that whenever I wanted to, I could come here.<eos> Now I have to fucking deal with you!
- Joanie!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Let her do it.<eos> I can't stand feeling like this.<eos> Like?<eos> Like I've done everything I can.<eos> And still what?<eos> This town is not my home.<eos> Joanie's not my child, but I've tried.<eos> Now Alison gets everything back, including you.
And you think I'm emotionally sound enough to take care of Joanie.<eos> Right, so I'm healthy enough to fuck, but not to be the mother of our child.<eos> There's a process in place for a reason, Alison.<eos> No, I understand, thanks for coming by.<eos> Would you mind telling us where you were last Wednesday night?<eos> He was home. With me.<eos> Cole will only ever see you as a disaster, Alison.<eos> Whatever you do, however competent you become, you will always be damaged goods to him.<eos> I need you to sign those, it's a "no contest."<eos> I told my lawyer that I don't want anything from you, I just want a clean slate.
You told me you hadn't seen him.<eos> Look.<eos> It was five minutes.<eos> We signed and he left.<eos> I thought you wanted me to get divorced.<eos> I don't care what you do.<eos> No, Gutteman told me that if I wanted my daughter back...<eos> It's emblematic of the whole problem, Alison.<eos> Wait, what "whole problem"?<eos> I can't trust you.
Can I join you?<eos> Did, Dr. Parry tell you who I am?<eos> You're the patient.<eos> That's right.<eos> I was here for a long time.<eos> How long?<eos> Six months.<eos> You must have been crazy.<eos> Yeah, well, I had a lot to work through.<eos> Maybe a little like you.
Well, I wouldn't recommend it. It didn't end well.<eos> But you do whatever you have to do.<eos> Dying is not the answer.<eos> I know it feels like a good solution right now, but you want to live.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because it's incredible to be alive.<eos> Everyone else assumes that life is a given. But you and I both know that it's not.<eos> You and I both know that breath can end.<eos> So we know that life is a gift.<eos> You'll miss Dawn, but you'll keep her with you.
You have to keep on pushing and pushing.<eos> I forget this about you.<eos> I get so caught up in you and I and our history and everything that that entails.<eos> But this is who you are.<eos> You're chaos.<eos> And I can't live like that.<eos> Well nobody's asking you to.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I just... I just wanted to share it with you.
And I can't live like that.<eos> Well nobody's asking you to.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I just... I just wanted to share it with you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because... you're the only person who could understand. I...<eos> I just don't get why you're so angry.<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Of course you did, Alison, 'cause it's about you.
Well nobody's asking you to.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I just... I just wanted to share it with you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because... you're the only person who could understand. I...<eos> I just don't get why you're so angry.<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Of course you did, Alison, 'cause it's about you.<eos> Everything's always about you.

I...<eos> I just don't get why you're so angry.<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Of course you did, Alison, 'cause it's about you.<eos> Everything's always about you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Heard you had a big day yesterday, Bailey. Wow.<eos> Word travels fast.<eos> I'm happy for you.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> We signed the divorce papers.<eos> You're divorced from Noah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And so am I.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who was he with you?
Intensely driven.<eos> I've never met anyone that ambitious before.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Go on.<eos> He was very mature.<eos> You know, he seemed like a man that could take care of things.<eos> That's not how you saw him?<eos> I found him to be so insecure.<eos> I mean, obviously very intelligent, but I always was after him to hustle more, call his publisher, or stand up to my father.<eos> It's like he was a completely different person with you.
Dinner's on the stove.<eos> Smells great.<eos> Um, so... I've been thinking.<eos> Maybe it's time for us to start our own family.<eos> We could adopt or find a surrogate.<eos> No?<eos> No, I-I mean, no, not "no."<eos> Yes.<eos> Definitely yes.<eos> Of course I want to start a family with you.
Hey, great talk.<eos> Shut it down. Yeah.<eos> Last survey was done three years ago, November. - Hey, Cole.<eos> - I mean, as soon as you can get out there.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Next week'll be fine.<eos> I'll see you at the house. Thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ally, I told you yesterday, I really...
No.<eos> I wasn't anywhere near the guy.<eos> Then where were you that night?<eos> I went up to Woodlawn.<eos> What?<eos> To talk to your doctor.<eos> Dr. Parry, right, that's her name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> To talk about you.
Then where were you that night?<eos> I went up to Woodlawn.<eos> What?<eos> To talk to your doctor.<eos> Dr. Parry, right, that's her name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> To talk about you.<eos> When you got back to Montauk, you seemed... clearer.<eos> Seeing you, seeing you with Joanie, just brought a lot of thoughts back to me.
Okay, wait, so, this is the big secret that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, tell the detectives that. - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Well, I-I-I have no idea.<eos> If I admit that I went up to Woodlawn, then I have to admit everything to everybody.<eos> A-admit what?<eos> Alison,<eos> I built this whole life, I'm building a whole house just to prove to everybody that I don't love you anymore, that I don't need you, that I don't want you, that I don't miss you.
Well, tell the detectives that. - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Well, I-I-I have no idea.<eos> If I admit that I went up to Woodlawn, then I have to admit everything to everybody.<eos> A-admit what?<eos> Alison,<eos> I built this whole life, I'm building a whole house just to prove to everybody that I don't love you anymore, that I don't need you, that I don't want you, that I don't miss you.<eos> But the truth is that I do.<eos> I need you.
If you leave Luisa now, you can't play the good guy anymore.<eos> Then you're an asshole, just like me.<eos> Yeah, but maybe you're a happy asshole.<eos> Instead of a miserable hero.<eos> You know, if you ever need me, you know where to find me.<eos> You're still here.<eos> This is my home.<eos> Our home.<eos> If you'll still have me.<eos> I'll still have you.
Why is that funny?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But it is.<eos> His daughter's band is in some festival, so we're gonna go see her play.<eos> - His daughter?<eos> - Juniper.<eos> She's super talented.<eos> How old is Juniper?<eos> - Twenty-four.<eos> - So two years older than you.
What did you need so badly?<eos> Want some?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Can you put your seat belt on, please?<eos> Fucking...<eos> You should really get that checked out.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Well, you're clearly not, because if this is fine...<eos> Helen, I just need to sleep.<eos> Is that okay with you?
I mean, you had everything.<eos> You're, like, out of armpit Pennsylvania and you go straight into some fancy college and meet a hot chick. She's rich.<eos> Her daddy buys you a house.<eos> I mean, hell...<eos> Me?<eos> I-I'd kill just to live that life for a day.<eos> But here you are.<eos> With me.<eos> Could I just have some water, please?<eos> It's funny, 'cause when we were in high school, I was jealous of you.
You're no better than me.<eos> In a lot of ways, you're even worse off.<eos> Don't you think so?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Answer me.<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Come on.<eos> Admit it.<eos> You think I'm doing better than you.
He just left.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> I'll get you some water.<eos> You sure?<eos> Noah, are you okay?<eos> Because, honestly, you seem very confused.<eos> Forget the water.<eos> You need a drink.<eos> Here you go.<eos> And I have a few other treats for you.
I know you.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You don't know me!<eos> You don't fuckin' know me. We're okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> - We're okay.<eos> - Don't know me.<eos> Wait.<eos> I like fucking you.
The time has come for honesty, honey.<eos> You're falling apart.<eos> You've been a wreck for a long time now.<eos> But the truth is, it's our fault.<eos> - What?<eos> - We admit it.<eos> We failed you as parents.<eos> Your mother and I... we've been seeing a therapist.<eos> He has made us see everything so much more clearly, and now we realize how utterly responsible we are for how disastrously your life has turned out.<eos> We want you to know we're here for you now, for whatever you need... vacation, money, counseling.
His mother makes it.<eos> He cooks, too?<eos> - Maybe twice.<eos> - Honey.<eos> Whatever you're fighting about, I'm sure it's fixable.<eos> Can we not?<eos> Your mom's right. Nothing's irreparable.<eos> - Look at us.<eos> - Well, we're not you.<eos> - And I'm not you.
But for you to let him near these children...<eos> - They're his children!<eos> - He was stabbed.<eos> We don't know what he might be mixed up in.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Nothing, it means nothing.<eos> She's losing her mind.<eos> - Stop it, stop it.<eos> - You have lost your mind.<eos> Both of you are out of control, and you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about!
You probably don't want to hear all this.<eos> You stole my husband.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I think we want two Jamesons on the rocks.<eos> - Are you even sorry?<eos> - Am I sorry?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Well, I-I don't think that I'm solely responsible, but I don't like knowing that my actions caused you or anyone else pain.
You know, something has changed.<eos> I know that nothing, absolutely nothing lasts forever.<eos> And everyone... you, me, Noah... we can only control our own choices... nobody else's.<eos> We can't save each other.<eos> We can only save ourselves.<eos> I have to tell you something about the night Scott died.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I don't?<eos> No.<eos> Did Noah tell you?
We have to go to Cherry's house right now.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because she has to know, and I'm not gonna tell her alone.<eos> - No, Helen...<eos> - Yes! - Alison, we must...<eos> - What good would that do?<eos> You know, look...<eos> Scott was a deeply troubled guy, and he was trying his best to hurt me.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm sorry for what happened to him, but I am not going with you to his mother's house.
I mean, none of that is true.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> I killed Scott Lockhart.<eos> It wasn't Noah.<eos> I was driving... because he was drunk.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Helen...<eos> So, anyway, you were right.<eos> I was lying to everybody... to my kids and myself and... you.
- Just go.<eos> - Excuse me, are you Kaylee?<eos> I would've been up out of there.<eos> I know, but... A-are you Kaylee?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Can I help you, sweetheart?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I get a haircut?<eos> Well, I would love to, but my shift just ended.<eos> Amy can help you, though.
You know that thing that Isaiah does with his right hand when he's really angry? Yeah.<eos> Now he's doing it with both hands.<eos> Man, Sadie and Albert have been acting super weird around each other recently.<eos> Do you think that maybe they were dating and then they broke up?<eos> You got all that from Isaiah's hand gestures?<eos> And Cam is there because...<eos> She's in love with Albert, Sadie found out, thus the breakup.<eos> My God, do you think that's it?<eos> No.<eos> The graffiti kid's parents are here for you and Cam, but I'm afraid to interrupt.
I can explain.<eos> No, I can explain.<eos> You're okay with dating me, but this morning it hit you, you could actually be in a room full of people staring at you, judging you, because of me.<eos> Suddenly things got real, you panicked, so you called in sick.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something like that, but, look, I just needed a day...<eos> You just need some time to figure things out, right?<eos> You'll get there.<eos> This is all just so new to you, Peter?
Where did you meet them?<eos> They came to my office.<eos> They brought me here.<eos> - How many are there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do they want? - I don't know.<eos> - What do they want?<eos> !<eos> - I don't know!<eos> They want you.
They came to my office.<eos> They brought me here.<eos> - How many are there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do they want? - I don't know.<eos> - What do they want?<eos> !<eos> - I don't know!<eos> They want you.<eos> They want you. That's all I know.
Is that what this has to do with... your old life?<eos> S-Sandra...<eos> Who was that man?<eos> Where did he come from?<eos> - His name is Theodore Peus...<eos> - Not him.<eos> The man I saw in the closet, the one who...<eos> That wasn't you.<eos> That had to have been someone else, someone else I want to forget entirely.<eos> I'm sorry I mistrusted you.
- Not him.<eos> The man I saw in the closet, the one who...<eos> That wasn't you.<eos> That had to have been someone else, someone else I want to forget entirely.<eos> I'm sorry I mistrusted you.<eos> Sandra, all of this... All of this is over now.<eos> I told you, it's been taken care of.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means I'm protecting you.<eos> It means you're safe now, and you will always remain safe as long as I am watching, protecting, because I got you.

The voting machines, the ones you rigged.<eos> Huck said it's some old B613 protocol... an algorithm, some obscure program.<eos> I don't exactly know the details.<eos> All I know is that you did it so that Mellie would win.<eos> Is that not what you want?<eos> No.<eos> I know how it feels to walk into an Oval Office I stole.<eos> I want to know the feeling of walking into an Oval Office I earned!<eos> And you still can.<eos> This is on me, not you.
Everything else was a liability.<eos> - That's what I was?<eos> - Yes.<eos> A liability?<eos> Yes.<eos> You knew that when you left Buenos Aires?<eos> I knew that the day I met you.<eos> You got married.<eos> To the wrong woman.<eos> If... I was going to break the rule, I should have broken it with you.
We are done.<eos> Let's go, Sandra.<eos> Let's not go, Sandra. Excuse me?<eos> Here's the problem with doing good work, Eli.<eos> You make yourself valuable.<eos> And only a fool lets go of a valuable possession.<eos> We both know I'm no fool.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I think I'd like us to have more deals.<eos> If you think I'm gonna be working for you...
And if we're going to accomplish what we need to accomplish, we're going to need some muscle, a strong back who can get things done.<eos> A strong back.<eos> So that's it?<eos> You're saying you own me?<eos> So, what, I'll work your fields and shine your shoes and pick your cotton and dance whenever you tell me to?<eos> You put a gun to the head of the woman I love, and I belong to you? !<eos> You have a streak of weakness, Eli.<eos> We found it.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> We're just better than you.
Well, you say, "Dance, monkey," the monkey dances.<eos> So, what's up for tomorrow, boss?<eos> Jake, can we...<eos> - Can you just stop?<eos> - Stop what?<eos> This smiling pod-person thing you've been doing.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just doing my job, boss.<eos> Stop calling me "boss."<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Okay, let's get this over with, because I am late for getting away from you.
Jake, can we...<eos> - Can you just stop?<eos> - Stop what?<eos> This smiling pod-person thing you've been doing.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just doing my job, boss.<eos> Stop calling me "boss."<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Okay, let's get this over with, because I am late for getting away from you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> What do I want from you?
I want you to stop acting like me turning you into a world leader makes me a villain.<eos> Olivia, I'm fine.<eos> I'm on board.<eos> I'm not acting like you're a villain.<eos> I'm just not paying attention to you.<eos> You don't matter to me anymore.<eos> It's you.<eos> You feel like a villain.<eos> You joined the family business, went Team Pope, became Daddy's Little Girl all the way, and now it seems cold and dark in all your gooey places.<eos> Too bad for you.
Are you sleeping with her?<eos> What? Are you serious?<eos> Are you taking yourself seriously right now?<eos> Listen to how you sound. Okay.<eos> But you can understand why I would think...<eos> No!<eos> No, I can't!<eos> You don't talk to me, but you talk to her.<eos> You tell her... everything.<eos> It's like she knows you. She knows everything about you.
No!<eos> No, I can't!<eos> You don't talk to me, but you talk to her.<eos> You tell her... everything.<eos> It's like she knows you. She knows everything about you.<eos> - We're family. - Yeah, exactly.<eos> But I'm your wife, Jake.<eos> I am your family now.<eos> We are a team. I want to know you.<eos> I want to know everything about you.
Did you like growing up in Ohio?<eos> - It's late.<eos> - What kind of a name is Ballard, anyway?<eos> How did you meet Eli?<eos> - What was the Navy like?<eos> - Boring.<eos> - Did you ever have to shoot down any enemy planes?<eos> You ever have to kill anyone?<eos> Could you at least tell me that?<eos> I don't want to talk to you!
- What was the Navy like?<eos> - Boring.<eos> - Did you ever have to shoot down any enemy planes?<eos> You ever have to kill anyone?<eos> Could you at least tell me that?<eos> I don't want to talk to you!<eos> Look, just...<eos> Here.<eos> I-I just don't understand how you can tell everything to Olivia but nothing to me.<eos> Oh... I mean, what is it exactly with you and this sister that you never had?
Where'd he go?<eos> No idea.<eos> After we lost, before Vargas was shot.<eos> And Jake was long gone, I remember.<eos> He can't leave.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> No idea.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hello, son.<eos> I've been paying attention to you, without me.
Still, that leash might have been worth it had tonight ended differently, had you become Vice President Jake Ballard, had you ascended to the right hand of power.<eos> But she failed.<eos> You failed.<eos> You failed.<eos> You should've killed me when you had the chance, because whatever this is, whatever you're trying to do here,<eos> I will come after you.<eos> No, you won't, son.<eos> You won't.<eos> Why did you come here tonight?<eos> I came here for you.
What do I need to do?<eos> You don't need to do anything.<eos> You don't...<eos> Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here. This is not your fault.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me... what you need.<eos> Come on.<eos> - I need you.
It was so silly, amateurish.<eos> It reeked of desperation.<eos> I couldn't figure out why, and then I found it.<eos> Found what?<eos> So much for making a president honestly.<eos> 5-7-2-6-7-4-4-1-8-7.<eos> That number sound familiar to you?<eos> It should.<eos> It's a trust in Switzerland you set up in my name, and for some reason, there's a wire transfer from it that makes it look like I paid Tom Larsen to frame Cyrus.<eos> I trusted you.
Previously on Scandal...<eos> No one's even thinking about Jenny.<eos> Her killer could be anyone.<eos> Olivia Pope, Jennifer Fields. You are going to kill Francisco Vargas when he takes the stage tomorrow night.<eos> Sandra, all of this... All of this is over now.<eos> I got you.
Looking for you! You're not answering your phone!<eos> I turned it off.<eos> Which is why I had to hack your geotags to track you down.<eos> I know you.<eos> What's the emergency?<eos> Boss lady's missing.<eos> Quinn was supposed to meet Liv back at the office after Jake and Vanessa went to the Liberty Report, but...<eos> I can't find her.<eos> Anywhere. Her car's still in the parking garage.<eos> She's not answering her phone. She's obviously not with you because you're doing whatever.
Do you know what happened the last time you asked me to do that?<eos> I peeled an innocent man's skin from his body with a razor blade.<eos> Huck...<eos> I just want you to know what you're asking me to do.<eos> He killed the President.<eos> I know what I'm asking you to do!<eos> You have to be sure, Liv.<eos> You have to be sure...<eos> 100 percent! If you are absolutely sure... yeah.<eos> For you, I'll do it.
It's nice to finally meet you, Jennifer.<eos> I've heard a lot of good things.<eos> Who is he? Jennifer, you should wait for us in the next room while we talk.<eos> Jennifer, stay right where you are.<eos> In here.<eos> Keep low, just in case.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Start talking.<eos> Quinn agreed to help me get to the bottom of whatever's going on with Rowan.<eos> I thought about calling you, but you would have ratted me out to Olivia, and the last time I saw her, she wasn't exactly being open-minded.
I wish you'd make this easier on me.<eos> You have no idea how hard this is for me.<eos> I had never met that woman before.<eos> I swear.<eos> It... it was like she was trying to be my friend or something.<eos> We talked about, uh, a plant that I have on my desk.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't...<eos> No!<eos> I trusted you!
It... it was like she was trying to be my friend or something.<eos> We talked about, uh, a plant that I have on my desk.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't...<eos> No!<eos> I trusted you!<eos> I-I-I-I have no idea who you think I am or what is going on.<eos> But please...<eos> Huck... don't do this.<eos> It was a mistake to trust you.
Get that?<eos> Abby.<eos> Abby.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> You are chief of staff to the president of the United States of America.<eos> Something has happened that has never happened in the history of this country.<eos> So you don't get to break down.<eos> You have to serve your country.<eos> You have to stay with me.<eos> I need you.
He has no idea, does he?<eos> It hasn't gotten that far.<eos> I mi... I might not do it.<eos> You'd make a great candidate.<eos> I have no doubt about that.<eos> You have the brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Plus, those tresses of yours, don't get me started.<eos> But let's be clear...<eos> Once you leave him, there'll be no more smiles, no more pats on the back, no more scotch on the damn seal.<eos> He will not be proud of you.

He will be abandoned by you.<eos> And... no matter how good your life is or how successful you are, there's always gonna be a part of you that...<eos> Well... you never really feel whole again.<eos> A piece of you is always with him.<eos> If you can live with that... do it.<eos> Run.<eos> Soar to great heights.<eos> Join me over here in the rare air.<eos> If you can't, don't.<eos> No one's going to blame you... Especially me.
I have been shot for this country.<eos> I have given my child for this country.<eos> I have handed this country my heart. I have given this country my soul.<eos> And while you were baking pies for your poli-sci professors and prancing around the quad pretending to stand for something, I was giving everything I knew how to give to my country.<eos> I know who I am and what I've done.<eos> And if I want to take some time away from this bloodsucking swamp, time for myself, run myself instead of being run by people with their own agenda for the first time in three decades,<eos> I think I've earned that right.<eos> Olivia is never going to Vermont for you.<eos> That... was low.<eos> Lower than you.
And when the time is right, maybe I can arrange a meeting.<eos> Because one of the things she can do is help exonerate Cyrus.<eos> Looks a lot worse than it feels, Red.<eos> Cyrus... No contact! Hey!<eos> Tom Larsen wasn't Frankie's shooter.<eos> He set me up, which means I am innocent.<eos> So if you came here...<eos> I came here to say I believe you.<eos> You are innocent, Cyrus.<eos> I'm going to war for you.
I'm gonna give you five seconds. If you don't tell me where Huck is,<eos> I swear, I will...<eos> He's dead.<eos> Look at that... Under five seconds.<eos> You still there?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Yours is not to reason why.<eos> Don't you know that? Yours is just to do or die.<eos> You're an animal.<eos> I am a working girl with a dream, just like you.
No one's looking for you.<eos> - Go away.<eos> - Not a single person.<eos> Just go away!<eos> I said, "Go away"!<eos> Am I a good boss?<eos> You want to blame yourself for this?<eos> Am I a good boss?<eos> Olivia, three years ago, I was at whatever below rock bottom is.<eos> I am where I am because of you, because you always had my back.
What was your best outcome for selling out your family?<eos> I had no idea they would harm Huck.<eos> And you have just as much blame for Cyrus rotting in jail as I do.<eos> I have done everything in my power to get him out while you have done everything in your power to keep him in, to turn a blind eye to his innocence to protect your father, to protect your place in the Oval.<eos> You knew Cyrus was innocent, but you still...<eos> Huck might be dead.<eos> My Huck.<eos> You really want to lecture me right now?<eos> You think I'm in the mood?<eos> Do you think I won't get a chair and work it out on you?
Everyone talks eventually. You're going to talk.<eos> I just haven't hit the right nerve.<eos> You know, some people, you can do whatever you want to them below their neck because it's their face they want to protect.<eos> It's the first thing people protect in a fight.<eos> You can train someone to deal with pain, but vanity...<eos> That's something way deeper.<eos> You want to tell me where Huck is?<eos> Now...<eos> I'm gonna take this tape off, and you're gonna tell me about Huck.<eos> No wonder Huck loved me instead of you.
Meg was our last hope at finding Huck alive.<eos> Liv.<eos> Okay.<eos> What next?<eos> He's dead.<eos> We've been doing this a long time.<eos> Huck is dead.<eos> Get out.<eos> Yeah, I can't do that.<eos> Charlie, if you know what's good for you...
We've been doing this a long time.<eos> Huck is dead.<eos> Get out.<eos> Yeah, I can't do that.<eos> Charlie, if you know what's good for you...<eos> I don't ever know what's good for me.<eos> That's not really how I roll. Now is not the time.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> For them, all of them.<eos> They need you right now.
You're telling me I need to forgive her?<eos> Abby, the person who put him in that hospital bed?<eos> I do not have to forgive her.<eos> You forgave me.<eos> That was different.<eos> I forgave you.<eos> You know what happens to you when you're in that Oval.<eos> You know what lengths you can find yourself going to in order to stay there.<eos> But you also know how to get out.<eos> She needs you.
That was different.<eos> I forgave you.<eos> You know what happens to you when you're in that Oval.<eos> You know what lengths you can find yourself going to in order to stay there.<eos> But you also know how to get out.<eos> She needs you.<eos> If anyone can pull her back, if anyone can save her, it's the one person who got out.<eos> It's Olivia Pope.<eos> God, how could you be so stupid?<eos> How can you look out for everyone around you and not see danger looking you right in the face?

How many times does this have to happen?<eos> When are you going to realize that the only people who really love you are right next to you?<eos> God, answer that, you idiot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a blind spot.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you're an idiot.<eos> Fine.<eos> From now on, I'll look out for you.
- Oh, it's not them I'm worried about.<eos> Oh, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry, nothing.<eos> I just don't understand what the big deal is if they know.<eos> Because, Alice, I don't want to talk about it and I don't wanna sit around and listen everyone's opinions about it.<eos> And I don't want people to feel like they can't be themselves around me.<eos> They don't feel that way, Tash.<eos> But see, this is why I didn't even wanna come out tonight. Listen,<eos> I'm just having a hard time understanding why you wanna be part of an institution that hates who you are.
And with the white family and Grace herself they made up a sort of gang to prepare the soil for the seeds<eos> Under the gaze of a demonstratively hostile Timothy with his mysterious white handkerchief<eos> He wasn't born here?<eos> He's a Munsi It's a line ofafrican royalty, it's a very proud line<eos> He don't drink, either, or gamble like the others be doing with their little blue tufts of cotton money?<eos> T'was Mam's Law we weren't allowed no real money<eos> Grace knew about the clever system of currency in Mam's Law<eos> Not real money you could use in the outside world<eos> The Munsi don't gamble 'cause don't believe in winnings<eos> They believe you have to be humble to your crops and only take what's absolutely necessary
I wanna go see the bear.<eos> You've seen the bear.<eos> - I want you to take me to Angie's. - You're not up to it.<eos> I'm not asking permission, goddamnit!<eos> Well, then call a taxi.<eos> - I'm going back.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm staying with my grandpa and Mr. Bradley.<eos> - The hell you are, Griff.<eos> - Yes, I am. No, you're not!
You're on at the big show at the Garden tomorrow night.<eos> You fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy. Number two heavyweight contender in the world.<eos> - Prelim before the championship bout.<eos> - Joe, this ain't funny.<eos> No, it's not. And it ain't no favor either.<eos> Griffin's opponent got cut and can't fight. We had to find somebody they could throw in at a day's notice.<eos> Nobody legit would...<eos> Nobody would take a fight with Griffin without training.<eos> So I told them... use the angle Griffin's gonna knock out a guy who's never been knocked out.<eos> You're meat, Jimmy.
- You think you're perfect?<eos> - No. No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Shut the door...<eos> Hey, you leave them out of this. Viv.<eos> You leave them out of this.
- Aunt Adelaide is vile and vicious.<eos> She's blind as a bat.<eos> And we are convalescing, for heaven's sake! That's enough.<eos> I don't want to hear... anything bad about her. She pays the rent. - She scares me.<eos> - She's only coming for tea.<eos> You'll all put your best clothes on and Nanny McPhee will keep you in order.<eos> I shall do my best, sir, considering that today is Sunday and I am off duty this afternoon.<eos> Off duty?<eos> You're off duty when...?<eos> You can't be off duty. I need you. They need you.
I have never heard of these gods.<eos> RENE Christian for 26 years<eos> I have heard of them paganistikous the gods!<eos> No!<eos> I have not heard so, no.<eos> Do you know Osiri the Mithra or Dionysus?<eos> JULIAN Christian for 5 years<eos> I have heard of them, but not I look to deal in respect to I really do not.<eos> But I have heard. It was in news a couple of times, but never the given importance.<eos> There is something to learn, something that you left?
Time really flies!<eos> Do you want me to order something from "Ciervo de Oro"? We'll stay home. —Okay.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> —Tell me if you don't want to.<eos> —I do, honey.<eos> —No, you don't.<eos> —Hear yourself.<eos> —I'm telling you to do it, honey.<eos> —But you don't mean it.<eos> —Honey, I very much want you ... to order the food and that we stay in together.
Father! I saw something terrible!<eos> calm.<eos> I will prepare coffee for you<eos> Colombian coffee.<eos> Tell ne more, son<eos> They kill him Father, I saw how they kill him !<eos> You should go to the police That was the worst thing !<eos> The killers were policemen !<eos> You must be wrong. Policemen help people.<eos> You defend then because you are right-winged, father
You know. I thought this kid was going to wind up working on the assembly line like his old man.<eos> Now he's got a way out.<eos> Hmm. Ms. Tobey's at ntac today for a physical.<eos> We're asking the parents of the students she's "gifted" to come in to be interviewed.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll call his mom.<eos> We'll do anything we need to to get heather back in that classroom.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks. You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.<eos> Just getting enough to eat. You konw it's such a struggle.
The book contains copies of secret government documents which according to Collier confirm his claims.<eos> The documents are from an anonymous source from the National Safety Center.<eos> According to the 4400 Collier came back to avoid a disaster that threatens humanity. Why did not you say anything?<eos> Collier claims that the government know this for over a year but the secret kept to prevent panic.<eos> The government calls the documents speculative and taken out of context. No matter who took them, or who they brought back.<eos> They had to continue.<eos> Did not you?<eos> They save the world. What do you think he said?<eos> He is one of them.<eos> You are very quiet.
The police.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll tell them i took the money you didn't have anything to do with it police, open up give us a minute!<eos> Open up.<eos> They're not after us<eos> we're okay<eos> guys? You there?<eos> Go ahead, gary yeah, sorry i've been so out of touch they had me in these classes all morning i haven't even seen collier all day or that other guy well, that's okay you just go where they tell you<eos> yeah, but i thought you said you wanted to know more about that money that collier's shelling out?
Take us to Murdoch.<eos> Sleep.<eos> Dr. Schreber.<eos> I knew you'd come eventually.<eos> Don't you think it's about time you started giving me some answers?<eos> Yes. Yes, of course.<eos> Won't you please sit down?<eos> I come here quite often.<eos> It's one of the few places I'm allowed a moment's peace.<eos> You see, they have an aversion to water.
My daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying:<eos> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."<eos> "Maintenance."<eos> I'm afraid I don't get your point.<eos> The veterans you see standing before you here have been through all kinds of heavy shit.<eos> They've always got the job done.<eos> Your new soldiers, these hotshots, how much action have they seen?<eos> And are they battle-tested?<eos> How about a few tests, just to get you on board?<eos> Make you a believer.
You weren't almost just killed!<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> School is in session!<eos> Is this a gym card?<eos> Oh yeah, gym member.<eos> I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1 200 times.<eos> So why don't you quit?<eos> You don't think I've tried?<eos> You think I like having $50 a month taken from my account?<eos> They make you go all the way down there.
Take your time, Harry.<eos> We're not animals.<eos> Are we, Ronnie?<eos> What?<eos> What!<eos> Maybe I wasn't clear, but I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut.<eos> I had to tell them something.<eos> Never say anything unless you have to.<eos> You asked me to get these guys off your back.<eos> Next thing I know, you're saying, "Have a piece of 'Mr. Lovejoy."'
Hurry up!<eos> Stand where you were.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I want to be both an artist and a humane person.<eos> - lt's quite possible.<eos> - lt's not a contradiction.<eos> But you chose to leave.<eos> As I left, I thought it might be possible to be both an artist and a humane person.<eos> - To be an artist...<eos> - ...you have to be humane.
We're insane.<eos> We're crazy.<eos> It's a carpet cleaning company.<eos> - A carpet cleaning company?<eos> - Yeah. No superiors.<eos> No scientists.<eos> No men from the future.<eos> It's just a carpet cleaning company.<eos> They have voice mail.<eos> You leave a message telling where you want your carpet cleaned.
This is your last year. You're going all the way. Yeah.<eos> They got the best shot of him, you know.<eos> And it's great.<eos> That was a great shot, wasn't it?<eos> But this one in the, uh, Tribune is what I really like.<eos> It says, "Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.<eos> Time after time was on his side."<eos> You know, the championship that I missed when I was in high school-<eos> Twenty-one years later I got a chance at getting a championship through him.<eos> You know, you're always trying to build your children up... and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"... but, you know, really lying on the inside a little bit, saying...
Yeah.<eos> Is that a bullet hole in your windshield?<eos> - .22 calibre.<eos> - Somebody take a shot at you?<eos> That's what it would appear.<eos> - Not much to hunt here, except Freddies.<eos> - Freddies?<eos> The Federal Forest Service.<eos> It's what eco-terrorists call us.<eos> Is that who you think took a shot at you?
- After the election...<eos> Are you telling me who's going to be president next?<eos> That would be valuable information. Mr Tolar has a plan that... that meets all your needs, whoever's in the White House.<eos> - He's trying to.<eos> - Neither one, sir.<eos> - Sonny...<eos> You're not the firm's only concern here.<eos> We put you into deals with other clients who may be sensitive about exposing their relationships to outside attorneys.<eos> That's a veiled threat. If you're talking about our friends in Chicago, they don't make money when I pay you fees.<eos> You do.
Do you recognize this man?<eos> He's a lawyer at White Blazevich.<eos> We're down to Akers and Linney.<eos> Linney's phone was disconnected.<eos> I'll get his class schedule.<eos> I'll keep looking for Akers.<eos> It's me again.<eos> I need the class schedule for Edward Linney.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.<eos> A student you talked to called White Blazevich, who called the Dean.
May I humbly remind you that this is a murder trial?<eos> And may I remind you this court will not try a man for murder as long as his identity is in question.<eos> Now please sit down.<eos> - Continue, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But I must warn you, you proceed at your own jeopardy.<eos> I think all these people are flat stumped now.<eos> These people have known you since you was born.<eos> Haven't you?<eos> They may not know everything that you'd do but they'd know what you wouldn't.
But you're such a brilliant frightener, Tim.<eos> You'd be wasted in one of those kid-glove jobs.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that you presume too much?<eos> Not in your case, Tim.<eos> I think I know you rather well, don't you?<eos> Mrs Harding.<eos> I suppose I feel I don't know you well enough.<eos> We don't have to be enemies, Tim.<eos> - I'm not going to be here for long.<eos> - Aren't you?
- One general.<eos> The one that's here.<eos> We have to convince him he's picked the wrong side.<eos> Would you rather follow a politician or Bajor's greatest war hero?<eos> I've done everything I can to help.<eos> I'd die for my people...<eos> Sure you would.<eos> Dying gets you off the hook.<eos> Question is, are you willing to live for your people?<eos> Live the role they want you to play?
Sorry.<eos> - How's the booze?<eos> - Haven't had a drink in three months.<eos> - What about the coke?<eos> I'm working my ass off.<eos> I'm off the sauce.<eos> I even stopped smoking.<eos> - How's not smoking?<eos> - It sucks.<eos> Now you tell I.A. I'm just an average, healthy, totally fucked-up cop.
Thank you. Give me that briefcase.<eos> Put this in the safe, for fun.<eos> Subpoenas from the McClellan Committee. - Huh? - Loan policy.<eos> - The loans are legit. - All the Las Vegas loans. Record Test Fleet.<eos> - Test Fleet is legit.<eos> - Kennedy and... it's a fuckin' vendetta.<eos> These two little creeps are riding into office...<eos> - We have a subpoena. - Forget about the subpoena. You can't square off with the White House.<eos> Then they don't square off with me.<eos> You follow me? Don't tell me who I can square off with.
You'll do fine.<eos> Wave bye to Grandpa.<eos> Let's do this thing.<eos> - Sir. - Hold on.<eos> Let him through, let him through.<eos> All right. Don't worry about it. I ain't in any rush.<eos> I know you got a job to do.<eos> I wanna say... that this is an unhappy day in my life.<eos> All of my petitions that I have filed have stated that the government has wiretapped, room-bugged, surveilled, and did everything unconstitutional that they could do to try and place me in jail, which they have temporarily succeeded in doing so.<eos> But I wanna say to my 1,800,000-strong members of the international Brotherhood of Teamsters, don't believe what people would have you think with fancy words.
Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not a mercenary.<eos> You see, I'm honest.<eos> I think that maybe we should go back to your place tonight. What do you think?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't think so, dear.<eos> Right now, the idea of being intimate with you makes me sick.<eos> Can't live with them, and you can't be one.
Where?<eos> What are the options?<eos> - Be a nun, be gay... - You know what the options are? Or see somebody who likes you no matter what...<eos> Chinese, black, white, whatever.<eos> - Exactly. - You're as wrong as the day is long.<eos> They're out there.<eos> The problem is we're lookin'... in the wrong places. We're looking someplace...<eos> I don't know where, but we're not lookin' at bus drivers, truck drivers, garbage men, and a lot of them are doing that.<eos> We just won't give 'em the time of day, but they're good men.<eos> How many men do you know... black men... who can effectively deal with a mate who has more education... and makes more money?
So you'll bribe senators to legalize gambling.<eos> Legalize sports gambling.<eos> You see, with all the heroes gone only legalized gambling will save the beast.<eos> You follow me?<eos> We're talking about big bucks.<eos> We're talking billions.<eos> That's nine zeroes, son.<eos> I'm not your fucking son.<eos> Have you ever heard of the Senate's Commission to investigate gambling in pro sports?<eos> Is that who you're paying off?
Writers don't understand painting<eos> My daughter said you were worried...<eos> That stinging pain?<eos> Please, I'm her father<eos> I'm here to help you<eos> No, to cure me<eos> You're in fine health, but a hypochondriac<eos> At St. Remy you thrived on your illness<eos> I'm no expert But my fits weren't imaginary<eos> You doctors aren't patients When you are, then what?
Security!<eos> Code one emergency. Security!<eos> Lt Worf is in sickbay.<eos> The wound was not severe.<eos> - Dead? Injured?<eos> - Three dead, four wounded.<eos> Another millisecond, we'd have been a dust cloud instead of the Enterprise.<eos> Why?<eos> I just asked if they would talk.<eos> You have your answer, Riker.
I don't expect them to listen to reason.<eos> I loathe the idea of a violent confrontation but we must be prepared.<eos> This is all you've brought?<eos> Where are your security men?<eos> We're not here to fight your wars for you.<eos> They have been seen moving towards the center of the city.<eos> People are scared.<eos> Don't you understand, Captain? They're dangerous.<eos> You are dangerous. They're only victims.<eos> You made them what they are.
I can marry him straight away...<eos> What about your father?<eos> It doesn't matter<eos> He's not my father, really<eos> I've been looking for you<eos> I forgot the keys<eos> Is this our floor?<eos> Sorry<eos> Good evening Good evening<eos> Are you going down?
Ray.<eos> Ray.<eos> Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me. There is something out there, and if I have the courage to go through with this, what a story it'll make.<eos> "Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to Iowa."<eos> You bet I'll write about it.<eos> You're going to write about it.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> ANNIE:<eos> Honey, where's he going? Terry's been invited to go out with the others.<eos> How are you feeling, sweetheart?
Come on, you want to get rough?<eos> - Things aren't the way they seem, Billy.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Why don't you stay here a while?<eos> Yes, stay a while.<eos> Quit it!<eos> It doesn't work anymore.<eos> Don't go home, Billy.<eos> Don't go home?<eos> Are you kidding me, they want me home.
I'm going to brew some coffee.<eos> - What enemy?<eos> Making a fire is strictly forbidden.<eos> - Just stop whooping.<eos> Might be better not to light a fire.<eos> You boys know nothing about art of war.<eos> First thing you do is build a fire.<eos> That's the most important thing in war.<eos> Officers might not like it.<eos> - Is that what you're scared of?
These guys are great.<eos> Charlie!<eos> Brad.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> Look at you... all dressed up like one of them.<eos> Well, I am one of them.<eos> I'm a bounty hunter. Yeah, right.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I work with them.<eos> Are you still...?
we cheer a little more.<eos> For a couple of hours out of the whole year, we are the people that we always hoped we would be.<eos> It's a miracle. It's really a sort of a miracle because it happens every Christmas Eve.<eos> And if you waste that miracle, you're gonna burn for it.<eos> I know what I'm talking about.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You have to take a chance. You do have to get involved.<eos> There are people that are having trouble making their miracle happen. There are people that don't have enough to eat. There are people that are cold.<eos> You can go out and say hello to these people.<eos> You can take an old blanket out of the closet and say, "Here." You can make them a sandwich and say, "By the way, here."
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em except in cases of emergency, but they're so much fun.<eos> Now, you think that's something?<eos> Go on, take a closer look.<eos> Attention commuters, flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda is now ready for boarding.<eos> Please step in to the transmission platform.<eos> That's where they come from.<eos> All carry-on luggage must be held securely.<eos> Thank you for waiting and we hope you have a pleasant trip.<eos> I don't know how it works exactly, but it has to do with some sort of gravitational lens deal-- bending the light or some damn thing.<eos> But you can move from place to place, world to world if you want to.
I can't.<eos> This Danish is pure protein. Oh, Mr. Kelleman, look.<eos> Uh... maybe Johnny didn't do it.<eos> Anyone could've taken it.<eos> Maybe it was, uh... I-i... you... it could've been that-that little, old couple, the Schumachers.<eos> - I saw her with a couple of wallets.<eos> - Sylvia and Sidney?<eos> Baby, you don't go around accusing innocent people.<eos> Yeah, but I even saw, I even saw them at the "Sheldrake".<eos> Didn't you say something was stolen from the "Sheldrake"?
- I knew they'd have to apologize. - I'm out, Baby.<eos> They fired you anyway because o' me.<eos> And if I leave quietly, I'll get my summer bonus.<eos> So I did it for nothing.<eos> I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway...<eos> I did it for nothing!<eos> No, no, not for nothing, Baby.<eos> Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.<eos> You were right, Johnny.<eos> You can't win no matter what you do.
Objection. Question is vague and misleading.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Did these men expect you to talk to them?<eos> Sure.<eos> Did you listen to them?<eos> God, yes.<eos> You did them favors?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Objection.<eos> What favors did you do for those gifts?
Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.<eos> Fuck. He's dead.<eos> You're dogmeat, pal.<eos> This is so nuts.<eos> Listen to what you're saying.<eos> It's paranoid delusion.<eos> It's really sad.<eos> - It's pathetic.<eos> - I don't know which species is worse.<eos> You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.
Alida, Siri, Lisen, and finally Jacobi.<eos> Is everybody with me?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Are you with us, Sven?<eos> Be careful, everybody. There's a threshold here.<eos> - The whiplash is worst at the end.<eos> - It sure is.<eos> I've got the toughest job.<eos> Now this is the funny part.<eos> You enter like this. And suddenly you steer her over here. You join their hands.
Tomorrow morning?<eos> And when are we going to do the rehearsal?<eos> We didn't dance together for years!<eos> How can we do our show again without a rehearsal?<eos> - Which one is the admiral's room?<eos> - 36, third floor.<eos> Mister director's assistant, we have a dignity to defend.<eos> I want my photos back!<eos> Will the ladies please sit down... The first report is ready.<eos> You're from the CST, right?
You're gonna pay for what you did.<eos> You're gonna die for what you did!<eos> You little shit!<eos> You're a dead man, Matt!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Come on...<eos> You let them both get away?<eos> Madeleine, I got troubles of my own, man.<eos> I don't wanna fight your delinquent sons, okay?<eos> You don't even care, do you?
What's he mean by that? It means he's flipped.<eos> ALL RIGHT!<eos> That night...<eos> The leader of the village took pity on the young man and offered him shelter in his home.<eos> As night came to pass, events began thusly... Taro Zakura Don! Taro Zakura Don!<eos> We have been apart a great time.<eos> How be your health?<eos> Weeelll... I'm more than just a little tuckered out,<eos> But I'll have to hold on as best I can. True.<eos> If you collapsed, who knows what the evil spirits hiding among the villagers would do.
A crazy woman who laughed while they stoned her to death<eos> Leave my mother out of this<eos> Get out of here<eos> You've been mad at me ever since<eos> Because you thought I was a tramp, like she was<eos> And really, you're exactly the same as she was Get out of here<eos> I made sure I wasn't going to end up like your mother did<eos> So I got the hell out of here. Like you should<eos> This village is crazy<eos> And if you stay here you'll go crazy too
You do everything you can to suffer!<eos> Know that being free is not living alone!<eos> The real freedom, it's life as a couple!<eos> You do not know what it is to be single!<eos> But what are you saying... I don't want to see you suffering!<eos> You understand?<eos> There's plenty of people who are in pain, you take care of them!<eos> Those who really suffer and there's no one listening to them.<eos> I'm trying to do this!<eos> But... But you can't do it! Nobody can!
Sir, you think you're unlucky, but we're telling you you're lucky because we've come with good news.<eos> Come and see how your daughter is doing.<eos> Have you come to take me away?<eos> Please, I want to go with you.<eos> Yes, darling...<eos> How are you?<eos> They keep me locked up.<eos> Day and night.<eos> They never let me out.<eos> You won't leave me, will you?
M-16s, pistols, everything.<eos> The whole fucking squad just went crazy.<eos> Bodies were butchered till they looked like piles of meat.<eos> My friends became animals.<eos> They began to enjoy it. I knew I had to get out, or I'd become one of them.<eos> So I started running.<eos> They called me a deserter, but what was I deserting?<eos> I had never understood what it was, what it meant.<eos> But now it was so clear.<eos> You see, they wanted no part of us
What could be more beautiful than a working person? Nothing!<eos> Although you'll have a lot of antagonists, isn't it so, Yelena?<eos> Of course, it's absolutely true.<eos> They will say: "What do we need this art for?<eos> This is just chamber art, fit for a boudoir.<eos> In fact, it's escapism."<eos> And I would say to them:<eos> "Sometimes escapism means plunging into the greater reality.<eos> Our people need the great reality."<eos> Though, do you know how our enemies may interpret it?
It's locked.<eos> Must be bolted on the other side.<eos> Maybe a gardener or worker has been down here.<eos> -Colin could be behind there, hurt.<eos> -Look, Tegan.<eos> Colin's.<eos> He must be still around.<eos> Yes, Maxil.<eos> I think you should come down here, Castellan.<eos> If you have something to offer the Time Lords, why not speak directly?
"Ed !" "Thank you !<eos> Appreciate that !"<eos> Too much pussy, pussy would be falling outta my pocket.<eos> Walking out the street, you say: "Oh, watch your step, that's mine."<eos> Being a comic though ain't like being no singer.<eos> The singers get all the pussy.<eos> Like the Bus Boys: they fuck everybody.<eos> Bus Boys will fuck anything that moves.<eos> Come to my house the fish stop swimming. They don't play.<eos> Singers gets pussy. 'cos you don't have to, even you don't have to look good, you can sing and get pussy.
Home.<eos> They'll be waiting for me.<eos> Friends, then. You must have someone you can stay with.<eos> And get them into trouble as well.<eos> -Citizen Asanova...<eos> -Irina.<eos> You've undressed me.<eos> Irina, this is the worst place for you to be.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> Either you are with them, in which case, it doesn't matter where I run, or you are not, and...
You must die for me.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I won't die for you!<eos> Should I have lied about the radio, Sergeant Hara?<eos> Should I have said I brought it into the Camp?<eos> Sergeant Hara!<eos> Stop it!<eos> It's your gods.<eos> It's your bloody awful stinking gods.<eos> They made you what you are.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Hey, Kenny! You scared all the chicks away!<eos> That's Kenny. Love him and leave him.<eos> Hey, we better beat it before all those girls get caught and tell Ronnie we're all down here.<eos> Is this what's called getting caught with your pants down?<eos> Kenny, let's go!<eos> Come on, we're out of here!<eos> Fuck him, Mike! He's being a wise-ass again! We'll catch him back at the bunk.<eos> Why do I have to clean up after these little peckerheads? It's not my camp.<eos> You'd think I didn't have anything better to do!
Don't pay a cent.<eos> Do you know what will happen if these terrorists have their way<eos> And million peso ransoms are paid by every victim?<eos> While this will eventually ruin our economy,<eos> Bank runs will happen, there will be chaos.<eos> But above all, these terrorists will be emboldened further,<eos> Defying our very own government.<eos> So I appeal to you and your members,<eos> Don't give in to the terrorists.<eos> You shouldn't be talking to me, chief.
I want to announce my PRESENCE and see what the reaction is.<eos> How will they know we're here?<eos> Report.<eos> The freighter has security clearance for its journey to Earth.<eos> Excellent.<eos> The disappearance of three crew members has caused a lot of unrest.<eos> Search the hold.<eos> You will find a scapegoat there.<eos> - Leader?<eos> - You have intruders!
You've no idea what it's been like resisting alone.<eos> -Who are these people?<eos> -Oh, this is the Doctor.<eos> And this is Nyssa and Tegan.<eos> You're all with Captain Stapley?<eos> Yes, I'm sorry if we seem like an unlikely rescue party.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Well, don't worry, you're not imagining us.<eos> If it hadn't been for the Doctor, we would never have found you.<eos> At least you're here.
- Are the kids really yours?<eos> - They are.<eos> You should be ashamed of your children.<eos> Take the kids inside.<eos> Come.<eos> How are you going to go out in public now?<eos> God damn you all.<eos> You wretch!<eos> You should thank your children.<eos> Otherwise I wouldn't let you go.
-Good morning.<eos> This your vehicle?<eos> -Which vehicle?<eos> -The sports car.<eos> -No.<eos> -Ah.<eos> I just wondered how you come to be here.<eos> There is only the road, after all.<eos> It isn't easy to explain.<eos> Well, while you're trying to work that one out, perhaps you'd like to explain this.
Four young and fearless Americans, children of the space age... armed with cameras, microphones, and curiosity.<eos> Alan Yates, director famous for his documentaries on<eos> Vietnam and Africa.<eos> Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl.<eos> and their two cameramen, inseparable friends, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso<eos> Four youngsters who never came back. But let's have a look at them at the beginning of their incredible adventure.<eos> Here at the border between Brazil and Peru.<eos> They are about to board a plane to take them to the Rio Ocoro. A last outpost from which they will continue on foot. Deep into the Amazon Jungle.<eos> Into the area known as the Green Inferno.<eos> Hey, are you really not scared? Not at all...
They are about to board a plane to take them to the Rio Ocoro. A last outpost from which they will continue on foot. Deep into the Amazon Jungle.<eos> Into the area known as the Green Inferno.<eos> Hey, are you really not scared? Not at all...<eos> I have been in plenty of dangerous places with them.<eos> What about you, Alan? Well there's only one thing scares me.<eos> and that's marriage..<eos> He'd take me to the North Pole to put it off...<eos> I'd say you succeeded this time too. And this last time.<eos> Yes, provided we come back in one piece.<eos> Well you four are certainly the first to embark on such an adventure.
That would be a sight.<eos> I'm going to have a time now, explaining what happened to Mr. Hobbs?<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Grabowski.<eos> Help yourself to a licorice there, Ceddie.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Do you recall what we talked about yesterday?<eos> Uh, politics?<eos> We also talked about Lords and Earls and Marquises.<eos> Recalled and entered the conversation, yes.<eos> Do you recall you said, you wouldn't have a Lord nor a Marquis sitting on one of your barrels?
They pick up their possessions and disappear.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> They going inland.<eos> They're making voodoo, I think<eos> Voodoo.<eos> Voodoo won't solve anything.<eos> Doctor, they're afraid.<eos> Very much afraid, these people.<eos> You too.<eos> You're afraid, aren't you, Lucas?
You big-time officers have shafted me twice.<eos> You tried to dump me in Italy, ran out on me back there.<eos> You expect me to drive you like some chauffeur.<eos> Nobody tells me anything.<eos> - You don't tell me what's going on.<eos> - I don't believe this.<eos> Excuse me, but is your trouble that you want to be part of the team?<eos> I don't want to be a part of any lousy team.<eos> I just want some equal consideration.<eos> I don't think you'll get equal consideration... from those people back there. Do you?
It might be drier in there.<eos> Whatever will he think of us if we don't go in?<eos> - I'll tell you. He'll think we're afraid.<eos> - Afraid?<eos> Who's afraid?<eos> He seemed friendly enough.<eos> What has he got to gain by asking us to join him?<eos> We can't sit out here like fools.<eos> Well, come along then.<eos> They think I'm mad, but you know I'm not and you still won't listen.
Mr. Justisen, read Extra Bladet.<eos> Definitely not to look at naked girls, Mr. Karstensen.<eos> Mr. Justisen, no one is saying that you sit... and study the naked pictures.<eos> It is just said that children are used... to seeing those kinds of pictures... and don't feel that their modesty is being impinged.<eos> Anderson, what do you think?<eos> I think that it was wrong of the children... especially after having been warned.<eos> I don't think that it should go unpunished.<eos> But could you not give a firmer warning... and then speak to the parents?<eos> No, no, Andersen.<eos> You know the parents aren't any better.
- Everyone's here?<eos> - Yes, Judge..<eos> - Mr. Vivaldi.<eos> - Yes, thanks.<eos> You saw the faces of all the assassins, right?<eos> Only one, the one who showed him his face.<eos> Would you recognize it?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Even among thousands.<eos> You're sure you would be able to recognize the man we're looking for?
- Bye!<eos> Sorry for making you wait.<eos> I am the Judge Macoleni of the Court of Novari.<eos> Marshal Gambino and the secretary Canavale.<eos> - Are you doctor Orimbelli?<eos> - Temistocle Mario Orimbelli.<eos> My sister in law Matilde Skrozati and mister Mafei, the friend of the family.<eos> I'm informed.<eos> They were with you on the lake.<eos> - perhaps you know... - I only know that my Cleofe is dead.
All you wanted was a quick kick up your oh be joyful.<eos> Right, mate, right.<eos> Like all them graduate social workers all coming round bleeding for you. Mmm.<eos> Easy as touching the street, mate.<eos> Nip out and get your methadone fix if you groaned loud enough.<eos> Cover for you if the fuzz come round.<eos> And forever telling you how tough life was. How it's all loaded against you. Moaning on about rights and civil liberties and victimisation.<eos> So what else are you going to believe in?<eos> Underprivileged, dependent.<eos> They get you so choked up with self-pity, you couldn't even button your own fly any more.
(JAGO ) Doctor, are you down here?<eos> Cover me in creosote, I never knew this was here!<eos> (LEELA) Doctor!<eos> - No, Leela.<eos> - But he's escaping!<eos> (SCREECHING) You mean the celestial Chang was involved in all these Machiavellian machinations?<eos> Yes - up to his epicanthic eyebrows!<eos> (AGONISED SCREAMS) What in the name of heaven's that?<eos> You'll have to book yourself a new act tomorrow.<eos> Cyanide gas might do for the brutes, though you'd have to shut the sewers off for a day or two.
What?<eos> She's Mr Lloyd's stepdaughter.<eos> They're all one family.<eos> What about Polly?<eos> She was at school with Jean.<eos> She's known them all for years.<eos> - For years, huh?<eos> - For years.<eos> What have I done?<eos> - What have you done?
We've got a witch.<eos> Burn her!<eos> -We have found a witch.<eos> May we burn her?<eos> -Burn her!<eos> -How do you know she is a witch?<eos> -She looks like one.<eos> Bring her forward.<eos> -I am not a witch.<eos> -But you are dressed as one.
Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!<eos> This is our Spanish room.<eos> Papa's wrong, it's our Mauritanian room.<eos> Did you decorate it yourself?<eos> I paid for it myself.<eos> - Do you like the room?<eos> - It's lovely and original.<eos> It cost a lot.<eos> Every proper palace has a Chinese or Japanese room.<eos> You don't live here?
Forget... everything.<eos> I'm sorry I shouted.<eos> That doesn't matter, Margot.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Karl said you swim every day, tearing along like a madwoman.<eos> You're getting pale and thin.<eos> You need to rest, not to train.<eos> Mother and Lore both think...<eos> Mother and Lore!<eos> That's all you ever say.
Yes?<eos> How about starting with tonight?<eos> Look, sweetheart.<eos> I know it's tough.<eos> But my business involves handling money for touchy people.<eos> Politics and so forth.<eos> Felicia's in a very difficult period in her life.<eos> Any divorce and settlement and so forth and my finances would have to be looked into.<eos> - Your touchy investors.<eos> - You do well for people, you don't stop.
It's simple economics.<eos> Today it's oil, right?<eos> In 10 or 15 years, food, plutonium, and maybe even sooner.<eos> Now, what do you think the people are going to want us to do then?<eos> Ask them. Not now.<eos> Then. Ask them when they're running out.<eos> Ask them when there's no heat in their homes, and they're cold. Ask them when their engines stop. Ask them when people who've never known hunger start going hungry.<eos> You want to know something?<eos> They won't want us to ask them. They'll just want us to get it for them.<eos> Boy, have you found a home.
Good evening!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Good evening, Madam!<eos> - How do you do?<eos> ...instead of Correggio, we could talk about the great Emilian's workshop.<eos> I swear on my honor!<eos> 5 millions is a laughable price!<eos> - If my friend Vollero will allow me,<eos> I think that, in a respectable parlor, a subject like that is a little risqué.<eos> Do you have children?
Miss!<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry!<eos> She hadn't digested well and she couldn't sleep...<eos> - Let her talk!<eos> No, if you don't mind.<eos> She gets too upset.<eos> It's better if I tell you.<eos> By now, I know it by heart.<eos> That evening, we had Brussels sprouts.<eos> You know what they are like?
- You're hurting me.<eos> - Consuella, this is an experiment.<eos> We must find out how it came here.<eos> Where is Arthur Frayn?<eos> How did you come into the stone?<eos> Zardoz...<eos> The stone.<eos> Terribly exciting.<eos> - But the suffering.<eos> - You can't equate their feelings with ours.
- Oh, my God, this guy's gota pancakebutt.<eos> It's not Pimento.<eos> Get out of there, Jake!<eos> - Thanks, Rosa.<eos> - So Detective Pimento didn't show up for work today.<eos> Any idea why?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I straight up drove him off.<eos> Big screw-up on my part.<eos> I'm trying this new thing where I just own my mistakes. I like it.<eos> Do you?
Why does she want to meet with me?<eos> You think our cover's blown?<eos> I don't know, but, just to be safe, let's review your backstory.<eos> I went to Yeshiva med school, residency at Mount Sinai, my best friend is Yacob Peralberg, and we share everything with each other.<eos> Can't imagine that last part coming up, but okay.<eos> You got this.<eos> Well, Isabel, your baby's head is the perfect size.<eos> Oh, thank you, doctor.<eos> Still gonna hurt when it comes out.<eos> So you're Dr. Schwartz.
- seemed all right after that.<eos> - All right, as in dead?<eos> I'm so thrilled you're finding this funny.<eos> - I don't know how you do it.<eos> - Farmer weren't laughing.<eos> They never do, do they, according to you.<eos> It's not the first time.<eos> Lads come up off the estate, off their heads on God knows what, and then they take one.<eos> Really?<eos> And what is it you think they do with 'em when they've got 'em?
Can you remember why you left two messages?<eos> To get the message across.<eos> You could never be certain it had gone to the top floor with Lynn.<eos> Her brain was so addled with crap, and, and... And...<eos> I don't know, I suppose I was hoping she might pick up the phone the second time.<eos> You had no subsequent contact with her?<eos> You've already asked me that, Ma'am.<eos> No, there was no subsequent contact.<eos> OK.<eos> Look, Catherine. You used to work in HMIT, you know the procedure.

You used to work in HMIT, you know the procedure.<eos> You left threatening messages on her answering machine, and you found the body, so we have to eliminate you, that's all.
So pompously?<eos> So brazenly?<eos> They have strong backing.<eos> It's legit!<eos> A TV set sells for $2K in Hong Kong and $8K in China.<eos> They earn millions of dollars in each transaction.<eos> Cash keeps rolling in!<eos> Used notes with no consecutive serial numbers.<eos> I need them today!<eos> You have $80M over there.
3 Days!<eos> Chief Song helped us recover the goods in 3 days.<eos> Chief Song, my buddy!<eos> You rock!<eos> It's incumbent on the police to maintain order.<eos> Boss Zhang, can you do me a favor?<eos> Go!<eos> Let him vent his anger.<eos> Stop!<eos> Chief Song, you're a tea connoisseur.
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> No one wins.<eos> The warehouse must be filled with money.<eos> Big Bro Chiu.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mr Cheuk, you know who Kun-xi is?
Free drinks!<eos> Free drinks!<eos> No free drinks!<eos> Frei drinken.<eos> Nichts frei drink.<eos> You must give me free drinks immediately.<eos> Drop it with the free drinks crap.<eos> We believe in the power of free drinks.<eos> There are no free drinks, and if you're trying to rip me a new asshole, you're making a big mistake.<eos> You are a shitty businessman.

Yes!<eos> Animal Planet. I love that show.<eos> No, not Animal Planet. - I'm Tom Brand.<eos> I own firebrand. - There you go.<eos> I use newspaper in the poopy boxes, and I see your face all the time.<eos> Look, I'm a little late for something, so if we could just get on with it?<eos> - Meow!<eos> You don't like cats, do you, Mr. Brand?<eos> Look, can I just pick one out? And then I'll be on my way.<eos> You don't pick a cat. The cat picks you.
I ask because I did the same thing, see.<eos> My name is Perkins, so I call my store "Purrkins."<eos> Oh, I see there.<eos> We're just like two peas in a pod.<eos> Yeah. Keep the change.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> - You might not wanna take that.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> You're running late, it's a gift.<eos> You don't want to be late.
You're just like him.<eos> That's what I've been trying to tell you.<eos> Stubborn and selfish and shedding.<eos> But here's the difference.<eos> I'm legally barred from castrating my husband.<eos> Drop 'em.<eos> Good kitty.<eos> Nailed it!<eos> Excuse me, who are you?<eos> Who are you?
I do.<eos> I love my dad so much.<eos> And he loves you, but it's not enough to say you love someone.<eos> You have to show it.<eos> Sometimes, love means sacrifice.<eos> You have to show it.<eos> When you came to the house, you were talking to him.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> I'm a cat whisperer.<eos> Yeah, but you were talking to him like he was a person.
That's gonna be, uh... you know, a fascinating transition.<eos> [singers] ♪ Damn it ♪ [serene music] [hawk screeches]<eos> ♪ ♪ Hey, your house is that way, dummy.<eos> [Jacqueline] Oh, my God, thank you.<eos> I've been standing here for hours.<eos> Watch out.

And Mrs. Wilkerson claims that you abandoned her on June 6, 1998.

Also, I'm not gonna pay this lawyer.<eos> Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news.<eos> The bad news is, Instagram canceled my account due to lack of interest.<eos> The good news is that in 2008, Ronald Wilkerson was declared legally dead... by this woman!<eos> He'd been missing ten years.<eos> With his diet, I was being generous.<eos> Sick burn.<eos> However, you did collect Mr. Wilkerson's Social Security earnings, as well as the money from an insurance policy he took out on his legs.<eos> I was inspired by Mary Hart to insure my assets at that time.<eos> So because "Ronald Wilkerson" is dead, Ms. Brooks, you can't sue him.

You bring a checkbook with you, mrs. Finestra? Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> There's a 150 charge for this meeting<eos> And sylvia will give you a questionnaire.<eos> You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone That there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> Well, she was mistaken.<eos> What if i hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.<eos> If you think this somehow makes me more comfortable With the idea of you handling my divorce--

She wants nothing from me.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> And I know that I am ridiculous, but I am heartbroken again.<eos> And it's all just projection, Harry.<eos> Most love is, sir.<eos> What did Proust say?<eos> "It is our imagination that is responsible "for love, not the other person."<eos> I don't give a shit about Proust, Harry.<eos> What pains me is that she's with that ass with the flowing hair.<eos> You have a beautiful head, sir. Like an artillery shell.
I just don't want you to be hurt, Harry.<eos> Sylvia's very bright.<eos> She comes from a prominent family, but she's too young for you. She's not.<eos> It's only a 25-year age difference.<eos> That's true.<eos> But then, ahem, think of the work she does.<eos> I don't judge.<eos> I'm just very protective of you.<eos> Have you ever considered... how many men she has slept with?<eos> No, sir, but have you considered how many men you've slept with?
"Homage" is French for "tribute."<eos> I know that, you smut peddler.<eos> Don't let him rile you, Walter.<eos> Brought some refreshments, Walter.<eos> - Harry!<eos> - Herschel.<eos> How could you, Major?<eos> So sorry I'm late, everybody.<eos> Um, oh, tea service.<eos> You're the new lawyer?
Glad you came to your senses, sugarpuss.<eos> You got some good pictures for me?<eos> - Yeah, I got something for you.<eos> - Oh, I'll bet you have.<eos> I'd like to talk to you, sir.<eos> Shit, uh, hey, look over there!<eos> The cops!<eos> What?<eos> - I don't see any police.<eos> Do you, sir? - No.
You were at Echo Park Lake.<eos> I've been a lot of places.<eos> Yankee Stadium, outdoor pissoirs in Amsterdam, Three Mile Island before it closed.<eos> Did you beat up Cornelia White?<eos> I'm not hired for the rough stuff.<eos> I got carpal tunnel.<eos> I only do surveillance and blackmail.<eos> Then who hired you to follow me?<eos> I am willing to pay for this information.<eos> We were told by Barry that you're the middleman for the middleman for the middleman.

Master Trigorin.<eos> Your... your... your cane.<eos> Thank you, Yakov.<eos> How could I have forgotten?<eos> Wait, Trigorin.<eos> I have come to an irrevocable decision. The die is cast.<eos> I am going on the stage.<eos> I'm deserting my father. I'm abandoning everything.<eos> I am beginning life anew.<eos> I am going as you are to Moscow.
Are you wondering if I contemplate my mortality?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> Good.<eos> I was just checking.<eos> I like to know how my employees are doing.<eos> Mr. Bronson, I'd like to cut to the chase.<eos> - I want to be reinstated...<eos> - Quiet!<eos> You live in a dream, Blunt.

Because I'm trying to help you.<eos> What do you think you're doing with the broadcast I gave you?<eos> I do what I think is right.<eos> Rudolph Global is a dangerous corporation.<eos> They need to be exposed.<eos> I happen to care about Rudolph Global, Mr. Blunt.<eos> I also cared about Exxon Mobil and Samsung and Pfizer, and the American Joe with his erectile dysfunction and chronic psoriasis, who's buying the pills and the creams that play between your A block and your B block<eos> and between your B block and your C block and between your C block and your D block.<eos> You're a shill for a corrupt machine, Blunt.<eos> So how can you possibly say you do what is right when you're part of everything that's wrong?
I must have a seat on that plane.<eos> Seat on that plane.<eos> Major, are you all right?<eos> Just a bad dream, Harry.<eos> About Bronson, sir?<eos> - No, another Orson Welles.<eos> Fuck that madman Bronson.<eos> I am not gonna quit, Harry.<eos> We'll find a way, sir.<eos> You're better than Rudolph Global.
You voluntarily committed yourself to the Cook County psych ward?<eos> - I'm on medication now.<eos> - For?<eos> Bipolar.<eos> You lied on your application?<eos> Well, you wouldn't have hired me if I told you the truth.<eos> I can't have someone on my team I don't trust.<eos> You're losing your shit.<eos> Go home. Sober up.<eos> You don't give a shit about me because you don't have to.
Have you been through this before?<eos> Yeah, as a kid.<eos> Were you a student at the university? Yeah.<eos> Can your family afford to supply you with an attorney?<eos> Well, did you call them?<eos> Ask them?<eos> No, my, um, my sister's getting married tomorrow.<eos> You know, they have other shit to worry about.<eos> Yeah, well, the campus cop wasn't hurt, so the court will likely set bail.<eos> Can you or your family afford bail?

I can't believe you're gonna put something like that on Matthew's record.<eos> - Rules are rules.<eos> - Yeah, but if a rule is unfair, then maybe it shouldn't be enforced.<eos> Well, you know, that might be the way some vice principals operate, but that's not the way I do.<eos> But I have enjoyed this spirited debate.<eos> Oh.

Not gonna be a raise, Dayshawn.<eos> Don't ask again.<eos> Well, I'm just saying if you can get me that money,<eos> - a brother could use it.<eos> - Jeremiah!<eos> Pants up. If you can get me some more of that money...<eos> Jeremiah, pants up, grades up!<eos> - Like I was saying...<eos> This song is dedicated to Principal Welles.<eos> You're a true hero.
I am so sorry that I'm late.<eos> There's a car parked in the principal's space.<eos> Dr. Brown was principal of several very high achieving schools in Philadelphia.<eos> Oh, look at you being so nice.<eos> And who's this sitting in my chair, keeping it warm for me like a gentleman?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My, this campus is just lovely.<eos> - Isn't it though?<eos> - Mm! Now, North Jackson's not the newest school Mm-hmm.<eos> in the district, but it is to me hands down the most charming. Even more charming now that you're here, Dr. Brown.
So, I've immediately released him from I.S.S.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's a big turnaround for you.<eos> What happened to the "rules are rules" thing?<eos> Well, I never really said it like that, but...<eos> - You did.<eos> - Rule...<eos> No, I didn't, but rules are rules.<eos> I still believe that, but also fairness is fairness.<eos> You understand what I'm saying here.

But, uh, I just wanted to let you know that you shouldn't give up hope just yet.
I don't know. I'm not sure.<eos> Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll admit it.<eos> I wrote the complaint against you.<eos> Mr. Gamby, I've been doing his for some time now.<eos> Whenever a new principal shows up at a school, you can guarantee that people feel like they've been passed over, and often times, they resent the new principal.<eos> I can live with people resenting me. That's fine.<eos> But from now on, you're going to be very cooperative and very pleasant when dealing with me because if you're not cooperative, Mr. Gamby, and if you're not pleasant, I will drag your face all up and down the parking lot of this motherfucker.

You're terminated.<eos> You do not work here anymore.<eos> Well, no!<eos> I can't lose my job.<eos> I love it here.<eos> You will grow to have other things.<eos> I'm sure in time that you won't feel as much of a p... person that has nothing.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> There's a... a dignified manner in which you can behave right now, and you're choosing not to do that, so please choose to be dignified.
Oh, fuck, shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Day in, day out, I make Justin a sandwich, and these other boys just go right ahead and smash it.<eos> They're being monsters to him, Mr. Gamby.<eos> Mr. Gamby?<eos> Uh, okay, ma'am, well, I'll...<eos> I'll be sure to take care of it.<eos> We won't have to worry about this problem ever again.<eos> Well, you've done a piss-poor job so far.<eos> Are you in charge or discipline or aren't ya?
"Mr. Russell is a great leader "and a great relationship builder.<eos> He is roundly admired by the faculty."<eos> After completing his analysis, Mr. Sason concludes that you two are excellent vice principals.<eos> With everything I'm going through, it's a comfort to know I can trust the men standing beside me.<eos> And I want to thank you for being a bright spot on a rather bleak day.<eos> You're welcome, Dr. Brown.<eos> You may be new here, but you are family<eos> - to Neal and I.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Russell.<eos> And Dr. Brown, if you or your boys need any toiletries or canned goods, I don't mind going to the corner store for you.
Look, don't make the whole field trip about yourself.<eos> Let's keep moving, guys, come on.<eos> Make sure you get Ms. Snodgrass and these guys in it.<eos> Okay, look sad.<eos> - Get a picture of me. - All right.<eos> Get a picture of me.<eos> You know how to use a camera? - Get a picture.<eos> - Hayden, you're out.<eos> Your turn... your turn's up.<eos> Snodgrass, you're staying in.

It's like I know<eos> - all your sweet spots. - Yeah.<eos> Let me guess, you also have ambitions to be a writer?<eos> Neal, can I tell you something?<eos> Yeah, of course, you can tell me anything. Great.<eos> Everyone thinks you're an asshole, Neal.

This is what happens when faculty members get shitfaced on mudslides.<eos> I'm just glad that everyone is safe.<eos> Yeah, so am I. Bill, what are you doing?<eos> Get these kids up to their room.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, that's enough excitement for me, for one night.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Um, good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Got to hand it to you, Mr. Gamby, you and Bill really saved the day. Well, Bill didn't do anything.
And it's hard.<eos> It's hard to do it alone.<eos> I just keep getting beat down and now the whole entire school is crumbling.<eos> Why did your associate leave?<eos> Well, he said that I was messing up the business partnership because I was being selfish and I didn't have his back.<eos> Well, did you?<eos> I mean, to be honest, yes, I did have certain questions about his tactics and ideas, but, I mean, come on, were both professionals.<eos> I mean, we're obviously going to have different approaches to things.<eos> Maybe you should just try to talk to him.<eos> Explain how you feel.
Thank you.<eos> - No.<eos> No thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Ms. LeBlanc, we got off on the wrong foot.<eos> May I get a redo?<eos> Dr. Brown, I understand what's going on here.<eos> You have lost hundreds of books through mismanagement, and you need a scapegoat.<eos> You are a two-bit, flavor-of-the-month principal.
Hand in date is two weeks from today.<eos> Okay, everybody, page 38, circles.<eos> Day 13<eos> fuck!<eos> Hiya, Grainne.<eos> What?<eos> Now, hang on.<eos> That's not very appropriate, Grainne.<eos> Mrs. Cullen?<eos> You are pregnant.
Whoa, that's a big needle!<eos> That is a syringe.<eos> You need to put a needle on it to perform an injection.<eos> Don't worry, it's not for your foot.<eos> Can I try it on my little brother?<eos> Sorry, no.

It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't fit his... pattern.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To put it mildly, I agree.<eos> I'm sorry this happened.<eos> You know he's always had commitment issues.<eos> Hank, it's not your job to clean up your father's crazy messes.<eos> (SIGHS) It's a habit, one I thought was behind me.<eos> Well, the crazy's part of the fun too, you know.<eos> Without the valleys, there are no peaks, and with Eddie R.

This season on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"...<eos> What?<eos> Carl!<eos> - The gigolo!<eos> - He's a companion.<eos> You made a wonderful man who I love.
Well, we're doing the best that we can.<eos> Is there anything I can do for you, madam?<eos> Make me a coffee, would you, Mr Pine?<eos> Sit with me.<eos> I'm afraid I can't, madam.<eos> I have to arrange taxis for various guests.<eos> Oh... Of course.<eos> Everyone must escape.<eos> Run, run, run.<eos> When are you leaving, Mr Pine?
Just one copy, madam?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will that be all, madam?<eos> - Do you have an envelope?<eos> - Yes. Seal it and put it in your safe.<eos> And, Mr Pine if an accident was to happen to me, as accidents do happen more and more these days, you should feel free to take it to your friend, Mr Ogilvey.<eos> Why should an accident happen, madam?<eos> Are you concerned for your safety?<eos> No.<eos> But I see that you are.
No worries.<eos> Let me know if you need anything else, OK?<eos> - OK.<eos> - All right.<eos> It's not much, but... it'll do.<eos> Why do you sit so far away?<eos> Out of respect, I suppose.<eos> Is that why you came all the way here?<eos> To respect me?<eos> You have many different voices, Mr Pine.

Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> - Something stirred, I suppose.<eos> - What stirred?<eos> Listen, if there is a man selling a private arsenal to an Egyptian crook and he's English and you're English and those weapons could cause a lot of pain to a lot of people, then you just do it.<eos> Anyone would do it.<eos> Plenty wouldn't.<eos> You were a soldier yourself, of course.
I was shown fake MOD end user certificates for seven different arms companies, UK and US.<eos> Do you mean these?<eos> Yes.<eos> Those are genuine MOD export certificates for Bulgaria and Italy.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I have signed letters from both Italian and Bulgarian governments confirming the sales.<eos> This is a cover up.<eos> Angela, are you accusing me of lying?<eos> I spoke to Rex Mayhew during his handover, before he joined the Royal Commission.<eos> He said that you persuaded someone to leak information from the River House.

I hate him.<eos> Message from London.<eos> I didn't expect you to come.<eos> Oh, ye of little faith.<eos> Actually, it was me that took some persuading.<eos> - I don't know who you are.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> Joel Steadman, American Enforcement Agency.<eos> - Pine.<eos> - And I think you might be playing both sides.
Jonathan, if things go wrong, I can't guarantee I can get you out.<eos> I was living half a life when you met me.<eos> I've got nothing to lose.<eos> But I will need your help.<eos> OK.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Yalla, one mixed salad.<eos> Erm, I'm looking for someone called Youssef.<eos> That's me.<eos> I hear you're a good man to speak to about a recipe for, um, tourli.

Oh, you beauty.<eos> Did you hear me, Mr Roper?<eos> I want my money.<eos> Now! We better leave.<eos> We mustn't be seen...<eos> I want the full amount returned to me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If you do not pay, there will be consequences.<eos> Don't you dare threaten me!<eos> Who do you think did this?

Yeah.<eos> I took it off after I left.<eos> Why?<eos> I had to.<eos> So if Roper checked with Meister's for a biography, Cairo wouldn't come up?<eos> No.<eos> What about Freddie Hamid?<eos> To him I was just a man in a uniform.<eos> He never knew my name.<eos> So just a little bit of airbrushing and you'd be clean?
No.<eos> What about Freddie Hamid?<eos> To him I was just a man in a uniform.<eos> He never knew my name.<eos> So just a little bit of airbrushing and you'd be clean?<eos> Clean.<eos> Do you handle cash in that hotel of yours?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I suppose you stole some of it?

Is this some kind of interrogation?<eos> Let's pretend it is.<eos> Did you cook for them? No.<eos> The mussels were marvellous, by the way.<eos> You weren't the lookout guy? - You didn't switch roles halfway through?<eos> - No.<eos> That's another of Corky's theories.<eos> Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?<eos> I don't expect a reward, I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life. And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.<eos> Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.<eos> Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.<eos> Operator asks his name, he hangs up.<eos> Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.<eos> - Gracias, padre.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> Mr Apostol?<eos> Who are you?
Which is why we're here and why you're being paid so well.<eos> I'm sorry, I cannot sign a blank document.<eos> They're not blank, there are words allover the place.<eos> Look, Mr...<eos> Collins.<eos> Mr Collins, it's blank to me.<eos> Mr Ertun, let me explain.<eos> And to be completely honest, I haven't read the documents either, and I'm supposed to be signing them.<eos> The choice that we have is not to do the deal today or next week. The choice we have is to do the deal today, now, this minute. Or we don't do the deal at all.<eos> All you need to know is that Tradepass is buying farm machinery from Farrago Holdings.

The choice we have is to do the deal today, now, this minute. Or we don't do the deal at all.<eos> All you need to know is that Tradepass is buying farm machinery from Farrago Holdings.<eos> Uh, Frisky.<eos> You see, ultimately, Mr Ertun, this is about trust.<eos> I trust you, and, uh, I'm asking you to trust me.<eos> It really is that simple.<eos> We were told you were the right man for the job.
Yeah, it is all good.<eos> Right, well, I think it's signing time.<eos> Yes, good evening, this is Sandy Langbourne.<eos> Tradepass for authorisation.<eos> I'm handing the phone to Mr Andrew Birch.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Please put Jan on the line.<eos> The purchase has been authorised, it's all gone through.<eos> It's all yours, my friends.<eos> And this is for you, Mr Birch, to seal the deal.
Who are the taxis for?<eos> The Western aid workers who can't get to the airport fast enough.<eos> Still, we do our bit, don't we, Jasper?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This is our little contribution.<eos> A safe haven for the wretched of the Earth.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> How are you? How are you?<eos> Hello, how are you?<eos> How are you?
The new 92F model contains a rollover sensor and modified control software.<eos> You miss it, do you?<eos> Being down there with burnt cork on your face, dagger in your teeth.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I'd much rather be up here watching, - thank you.<eos> - Quite right, too.<eos> War as spectator sport.<eos> We are emperors of Rome, Andrew.<eos> Blood and steel, the only elements that ever meant anything.<eos> Now, Mr Barghati, we have taken the liberty of assuming neither you nor the other members of your consortium are signatories to the Oslo Convention.
I'm Kelly Baptiste.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, the woman from the newspaper.<eos> You wanted to know about my old teacher, Bugenhagen.<eos> Damien Thorn.<eos> May I?<eos> I don't have very much time.<eos> Thank you for seeing us.<eos> Damien's father...<eos> I know exactly who you are, Mr. Thorn.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Please, Daddy, no!<eos> It's you.<eos> How... how did you get here?<eos> What? What? Why did you say those things?<eos> What... what... what's all for me?<eos> No, wait.<eos> Well, how... who are you?
My mother, she's dead. Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> This does... this doesn't make any sense.<eos> None of this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> What?<eos> Well, the sad fact is that she's been dead to you for 25 years.<eos> You've already grieved.
I just wanted to come by, check on you, make sure you're all right.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Good.<eos> I heard about the thing in the subway last night.<eos> It's a good thing you weren't killed.<eos> It looks like I should be asking about you.<eos> Yeah, do you know, there was someone killed in the subway, though.<eos> Yeah, and he heard about that after he pulled the kid off the train tracks.<eos> Saved his life.<eos> Who are you?
Couldn't yank it free.<eos> Pulled his face right into the machinery.<eos> Ripped it wide open.<eos> You want anything?<eos> Corn chips?<eos> Twizzlers?<eos> Yeah, broke his teeth chewed off his nose severed his carotid artery.<eos> Blood everywhere.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> You know... it was right about that time you saved that kid.
Wall Street player.<eos> Armitage Global.<eos> I pulled the security tapes in the subway station.<eos> It was pretty clear you were chasing him.<eos> I was just running to catch the train.<eos> What train?<eos> Where were you going?<eos> I'd really like to help you, but I just don't know anything.<eos> See, here's what I'm struggling with.<eos> In the last few days, you've been in very close proximity to a few, uh... oh, I don't know, what do I call 'em?
We can't afford to fall into separate camps.<eos> Perhaps we should get used to sharing the stage.<eos> What are you proposing?<eos> You've got Damien.<eos> I have everything else in place.<eos> We need to work together, not against each other.<eos> We need to trust each other.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> Igor Reneus.<eos> You and Kelly Baptiste paid him a visit.
Hey, watch...<eos> Uhh!<eos> Get him up here!<eos> The Beast.<eos> Mr. Thorn's work is brilliant.<eos> There's no question about that.<eos> But we do have some concerns about him professionally.<eos> Is this because he didn't show up to the interview?<eos> Among other things.<eos> The woman he loves dies a horrible death, is literally ripped from his hands, and you think he should've made this his priority?

Is Damien...<eos> No, he's fine.<eos> Do you, uh, mind if I come in?<eos> Of course.<eos> Just had a few questions to ask you.<eos> May I offer you some coffee?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm gonna get right to the point. Mr. Thorn's down at the police station right now.<eos> We brought him in for questioning about his possible involvement in the death of Troy Hendrie.<eos> Mr. Thorn suggested that you might've known him.
No, thank you.<eos> I'm gonna get right to the point. Mr. Thorn's down at the police station right now.<eos> We brought him in for questioning about his possible involvement in the death of Troy Hendrie.<eos> Mr. Thorn suggested that you might've known him.<eos> Yes.<eos> He worked with me at Armitage.<eos> Hmm. Ms. Rutledge, are you Mr. Thorn's attorney?<eos> Yes.<eos> He says you're not.<eos> He says he only met you a week ago, and he suggested that you might be stalking him.
I thought you had all the answers.<eos> No one has all the answers.<eos> Then this is a waste of time.<eos> Some groups want to worship you.<eos> Others want you dead.<eos> Like that guy who came after me?<eos> Who was he?<eos> An unprotected pawn.<eos> Well, he almost succeeded in trying to kill me.<eos> So much for you being my guardian angel.
Some guy bought it in another part of the station.<eos> Come on, shut this down. Time to get some sleep.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get a life.<eos> I came as soon as I heard.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I brought sushi.<eos> Chef Masa is a dear old friend of mine.<eos> He prepared it himself.<eos> Was that man really after me, or was he just someone you wanted out of your way?
One woman was in labor. She couldn't run.<eos> They dragged her husband into the square.<eos> and she was screaming... for hours.<eos> The fields were filled with the screams of the dying.<eos> The militia, they just stood there, smoking, laughing at her screams.<eos> The flames burned higher.<eos> When that baby's head was finally showing they ripped it out of her... and threw it on the fire.<eos> Its first breath was a scream.<eos> After that... they killed them all.<eos> And you blame me for destroying that photo.

Antichrist head game of yours.
Good meeting?<eos> You have that look.<eos> I have to celebrate.<eos> There any good bars around here?<eos> Wait, I... hey.<eos> In the last few days, you've been in close proximity to a number of... unexplained deaths? Hey!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I may not be able to prove it, but I know you're responsible for those deaths.
Philadelphiam is missing.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Forgive me, Father, I cannot.<eos> I'm to go to New York.<eos> There's one there we think is the Beast.<eos> You are to ask questions, collect data, return, and report your findings.<eos> We will decide if he's the Beast, not you.<eos> The Vatican council could take years.<eos> If what I've heard is true, we need to...<eos> You are a scribe, nothing more.
'Do you know the name Alice Webster? '<eos> Er, the British girl?<eos> She was abducted...2003, no?<eos> Yesterday...she came back.<eos> She walked right into the middle of the town square.<eos> There's a name she mentioned when the paramedics asked who they could call.<eos> She said the name Sophie Giroux.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sophie Giroux?<eos> I know this all happened 11, 12 years ago, but you were the lead detective on her abduction.
You should talk to him.<eos> For all the good it will do.<eos> And how are you sleeping?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I don't know what I'm expected to do.<eos> You're not expected to do anything, Sam.<eos> I am, though, aren't I?<eos> Why else would you be with the head doctor?<eos> You want me to talk about Alice and all that.<eos> Not unless you want to.
Look, I choose what risks I take.<eos> I do not take them lightly but, when I do, they're mine alone.<eos> You're married, right?<eos> You have a family?<eos> Yes.<eos> What do I tell them if you don't come back?<eos> How do I explain that I risked taking someone with no experience of the region, with no real planning, into the Iraqi desert right between two groups of people whose sole ambition in this life is to kill one another?<eos> You could tell them you had two choices, to do nothing, or to do something.<eos> I could go home.<eos> You could go home.
And there are other clear indications that your daughter has given birth.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> We'll head back to camp and brief the Brigadier.<eos> We need to organise a thorough debrief later today.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Bonjour.<eos> Are you Sergeant Stone?
All Alice remembers is being in the forest.<eos> She walked hours until she found the road.<eos> Where, exactly, she's not sure.<eos> Was there a yellow van mentioned in Alice's abduction?<eos> That was the only clue we had in Sophie's case.<eos> Baptiste, I've said enough already.<eos> Look, I don't want to interfere with your investigation, but I made the parents of Sophie Giroux a promise.<eos> There is no-one who knows that case better than I.<eos> You looked me up, Sergeant.<eos> You know who I am and what I've done.
- I'm all right.<eos> - 5.50, bro.<eos> - I didn't want any mayo.<eos> - It's garlic sauce, innit?<eos> - I don't want any.<eos> - Give me another burger without mayonnaise. - It's not Mayo.<eos> It's garlic sauce.<eos> Give me another burger!<eos> - What... what is it?<eos> - Are you the manager?
- Do you hear me?<eos> ! - Yes, sir!<eos> You have been misled by this imbecile.<eos> The minute he killed one of our own... you should have torn him to pieces.<eos> But maybe it's time to remind you that the Brotherhood goes way beyond Banshee, Pennsylvania.<eos> You're part of a national movement, one that not only shares your beliefs, but is willing to do something about it.<eos> This is Monty.<eos> He's gonna be running things from now on.<eos> - Make sure things go smoothly from here on out.<eos> - You cannot come here...
- No. You don't understand, and I don't want to talk about it with you any more!<eos> - Suit yourself.<eos> Nikki, my dear, you must know that things are very serious with our finances.<eos> As a woman, your sister has no claim over Prince Andrei's estate and nothing your father tries ever seems to work out, and he has such a generous nature that everybody takes advantage of him.<eos> And you, my dear Nikki... with all that business about the card game and your friend Dolokhov, that was a terrible blow to the family fortunes.<eos> I know, Mama, and I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're sorry, and I know you'll be very glad to hear that you have it in your power to make all things well again.<eos> How can I do that?<eos> You remember Julie Karagina?<eos> - You used to be playmates together.
So... who hasn't declared yet?<eos> Okay.<eos> Jen?<eos> Um, developmental bioenergetics? Okay.<eos> Okay, that's good.<eos> Roger.<eos> Cross-species genetic engineering.<eos> Uh, that's... not a good topic. What's your second choice?<eos> Why can't I do that one?<eos> You wrote a paper on the possibility of cross-species genetics six years ago. It even got published.
Then...<eos> Go ahead, enter.<eos> Dear madam, in order to continue straight, do you allow us to walk on this obstacle?<eos> That's why we sleep here...<eos> Wait to see...<eos> Help me.<eos> That's good.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Thank you, sublime lady.<eos> You have just entered history.
- Carrie Wells.<eos> - Lieutenant Burns.<eos> Thank you for your service.<eos> Chris explained to me why you're here.<eos> I was... shocked to hear about Laura's death.<eos> She was a wonderful woman. She managed one of my charities and did a great job.<eos> We're actually also investigating the murder of a journalist, Nate Orton.<eos> - Does that ring a bell?<eos> - No. I'm sorry.<eos> It's interesting. You and Laura were at the same fund-raiser the night she died, and in her car we found a table number placer for table 9... but she sat at table 17.
Not many people could swing that kinda dough in under an hour.<eos> Not too many people own a private island<eos> - at Seychelles either. - That's true.<eos> Follow the plan, you'll get your son back.<eos> The caller was very specific, no cops.<eos> Mr. Allen, believe me, we do this all the time.<eos> You gotta trust us. I'm sorry, it's just... this is my son's life we're talking about.<eos> I understand.<eos> Look, it's simple. You're making a transaction.<eos> You give him what he wants.

You're making a transaction.<eos> You give him what he wants.<eos> He gives us what we want. My son is not some business transaction, Lieutenant.<eos> I know it's impossible, but you gotta try to take away the emotion because that's what it is to him.<eos> Okay? We'll be watching you, making sure you and Mason are safe.
From what I can see, guy's clean.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I mean, we still have a strong case for burglary, right?<eos> He must have broken into the Allens to get that award.<eos> Family is on their way in.<eos> Jason Lutz.<eos> - If you say so. - What?<eos> - You've never seen him before?<eos> - No. That's really quite interesting because he was found murdered and I think you killed him.<eos> You're... you're throwing some pretty wild accusations at me here, okay?
How's that?<eos> I, uh... I know how much it hurts to... have something taken away from you.<eos> Right.<eos> Which is why you took something away from him, right?<eos> I had nothing to do with it.<eos> I'm talking about the trophy.<eos> The Prometheus science trophy.<eos> Awarded to Hudson University's most brilliant science and engineering student.<eos> Oh, that?<eos> I mean, I bet you thought you should have won it, right?
Look.<eos> Ken was, you know, a great guy, but, well, he was always just a bit dim when it came to the science.<eos> If I'm being honest, he was always a couple of steps behind when we worked together.<eos> I had to, you know, carry the ball, so to speak.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> He's delusional.<eos> - But you two did work together? - Yes.<eos> I mean, nothing groundbreaking. I was in my 20s.<eos> We were just scratching the surface back then.<eos> And then you became Kenneth Allen, CEO of one of the biggest chemical corporations in New York, and he became Jim Garrett... exterminator.
Well, they had a bit of a bug problem, and, you know, they called the pest control company. I happen to work there, so when I saw their request for services, I thought I'd step in and rid them of their worries.<eos> So, what? You just, uh... do your work and then stash the trophy, walk out with it on... on your way out?<eos> Thought it would look good on my living room table.<eos> You do know burglary is a crime?<eos> Actually, it's not burglary unless you enter the home with the intent to commit a felony therein.<eos> "Therein"?<eos> Wow!<eos> What are you? A damn lawyer?<eos> You work for a bug company.<eos> You're a smart guy, huh, Jim?
And if Feld thought Norah was jumping ship to Joyce's crew, he may have killed to protect his secrets.<eos> Let's go talk to Avra Feld.<eos> Thanks for talking to us, Mr. Feld.<eos> We just want to ask you a few questions about Norah Al-Bayati.<eos> Norah Al-who?<eos> It seems she might have worked for you.<eos> I've got thousands of people that work for me. I can't keep track of them all.<eos> I was named "Forbes'" Most Influential Businessman last year, if you happen to recall.<eos> I do happen to recall.<eos> It was "Forbes'" Most Influential Techies, and you were number two underneath Joyce Chen.
I do happen to recall.<eos> It was "Forbes'" Most Influential Techies, and you were number two underneath Joyce Chen.<eos> If you're looking for a list of my employees, you can talk to my secretary.<eos> No, we know your employees sign NDAs, so chances are, if Norah worked here, your secretary would have no record of that.<eos> Then we're done here, Detectives.<eos> Norah worked on projects that she couldn't talk about.<eos> She had signed papers, nondisclosure agreements.<eos> Oh, my God, the cat.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're planning some kind of mission to Mars, specifically to the volcano Arsia Mons, and Norah was helping you.
- That facility was on lockdown.<eos> No one coming in, no one going out, which means if she was murdered, someone on the inside did it.<eos> And that narrows down our list of suspects.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Norah never left your facility, at least not alive.<eos> Which means Norah's killer is one of the six other candidates.<eos> But now that they've started, I can't interrupt the lockdown.<eos> The candidates have already begun isolation for the next training period.<eos> - It would compromise the entire... - You know what I think?<eos> I think that you don't want anyone in your facility digging around that might expose your secrets.
- It would compromise the entire... - You know what I think?<eos> I think that you don't want anyone in your facility digging around that might expose your secrets.<eos> That's assuming that your theory has any connection to reality.<eos> You know what does have a connection to reality?<eos> Me talking to Joyce Chen about your reusable rocket. Nice try.<eos> Everyone who's anyone is trying to develop a reusable rocket.<eos> Not everybody's doing it using a nuclear thermal rocket with a compact fission reactor core using 93% enriched uranium-235 fuel.<eos> How the hell do you know that?<eos> You're not the only one with secrets, Mr. Feld.<eos> You should know Joyce Chen is a little smitten with my partner here.
Never went on her record.<eos> Why were the charges dropped?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sadie didn't want to talk about it.<eos> We were just relieved.<eos> She had had so many tough breaks.<eos> We didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.<eos> There it is, no wonder why it didn't show up at first.<eos> Sadie's latest brush with the law was erased from the C.I.I. database.<eos> But you found it, Detective.
You've assaulted people over a hell of a lot less.<eos> I would kill someone for robbing my grandmother, so I ain't insulted by the inquiry.<eos> What about a girl?<eos> Would you kill her?<eos> I don't hit girls.<eos> I got a business to run, which is what I was doing night before last.<eos> I was at a show in Philly.<eos> Someplace called Low End Theory.<eos> Someone there will remember me.<eos> You better hope they do.
Are you okay?<eos> You all right, sir? You okay?<eos> That was... awesome!<eos> I'm not paying for the NYPD bust, though.<eos> I didn't order that.<eos> You paid for this?<eos> Of course, he paid.<eos> I earn a living doing this. No laws have been broken.<eos> A couple of laws of nature.<eos> So what are you? Some kind of a scare dominatrix?
But you chose not to respond to them?<eos> Did we not call them back?<eos> I'm sorry. Things are just so busy with the rollout, doing press for the game.<eos> Yeah, that's much more important than a murder investigation.<eos> I don't appreciate the insinuation.<eos> And I would have been at the crime scene myself, but I was on a conference call with Myanmar.<eos> Did you make those calls from the Gold Room?<eos> Yeah, see, we know about the Gold Room hidden inside Satan's Palace.<eos> And we know that you were meeting with Jason Rios there last night just before he was murdered.<eos> Which is odd because you were nowhere to be found after he turned up dead.
If anybody knows what he was up to in his spare time, she would.<eos> I'm just curious, how would the company react if an individual tried to market something he'd come up with on his own?<eos> Well, we'd ask that employee not to.<eos> And if they continued, we'd sue them.<eos> We wouldn't kill them, Detective, if that's what you're imagining.<eos> Rhonda, these people are from the police. They have some questions about Jason. Uh, sure.<eos> Of course.<eos> This is all so unbelievable.<eos> Did you find out who did it?<eos> You and Jason were pretty close, weren't you?
Well, we'd ask that employee not to.<eos> And if they continued, we'd sue them.<eos> We wouldn't kill them, Detective, if that's what you're imagining.<eos> Rhonda, these people are from the police. They have some questions about Jason. Uh, sure.<eos> Of course.<eos> This is all so unbelievable.<eos> Did you find out who did it?<eos> You and Jason were pretty close, weren't you?<eos> Yes, but I have no idea who killed him.<eos> You and Jason worked on a number of projects together?
That's the same molecule Carrie found in Rhonda's desk.<eos> - Does Al know this?<eos> - Yup. Just watch.<eos> You still haven't explained how you ended up with that phone.<eos> I told you, someone's setting me up.<eos> The same someone who made you lie to us about helping Jason with that battery?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Jason had a model just like that in his apartment.<eos> It's the critical component of next phase batteries.<eos> Jason was developing them for someone outside the company, and you were helping him.
Very good.<eos> Who's that beautiful woman in the photo?<eos> Part of the crew?<eos> It was 20 years ago.<eos> 23 years, actually.<eos> Exactly the same age as Jason.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You know what's interesting?<eos> Jason had a picture of himself as a little boy, and that woman was holding him.<eos> And you're his father.
And you're his father.<eos> I've got nothing to say.<eos> It's gonna be a lot easier for you if you just talk to us right now.<eos> Graciela was the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid eyes on.<eos> It was one night.<eos> I didn't even know about Jason until... a year later, she sent me a picture.<eos> I tried to do my best to look out for him.<eos> I paid for his education.<eos> And she wrote me and said he'd won a... Robotics Scholarship competition.<eos> And you knew he had it, your gift.
I believe I'm gonna take this one.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Boss man rolling up his sleeves and getting dirty.<eos> I'm glad you approve.<eos> I'll leave you to... is there a term for what you was just doin'?<eos> Oh, I believe<eos> "breathtaking'."<eos> _<eos> - Believe y'all won State that year.<eos> - Hey. You must be Coach Blantz.
Is it gonna matter if I say no?<eos> You got a glass?<eos> Just the glass there, "Spitz."<eos> You want a drink, too?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You hungry, 'cause there's leftover cake in the fridge.<eos> "Civilization begins with distillation."<eos> William Faulkner said that.<eos> He was a Four Roses man just like you.<eos> Who are you? Huh?
That's six years teaching pimply little shitheads how to Australian crawl.<eos> All yours in advance.<eos> Take it. Enjoy it.<eos> Buy that gorgeous wife of yours a car.<eos> Okay.<eos> And then what?<eos> Over the next several months, I'll approach you with jobs.<eos> Each job pays four grand until you've earned out.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> And you'd be the broker.
Ticket for the flight to Paris.<eos> On the bed.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> This would be a very good opportunity for me to practice my French.<eos> How do you say 'Winnie the Pooh' in French?<eos> Karl Roebuck.<eos> Louise Renard.<eos> And you are?
But she's not in the queue.<eos> Zoom in.<eos> What's that logo on his cap? Looks like an eight.<eos> We don't know who he is.<eos> I could magnify more...<eos> Who was it, then?<eos> You ever considered the idea you didn't have your boiler properly serviced?<eos> Yeah, that's the problem isn't it? There's always a perfectly reasonable explanation. That must be frustrating with us,.<eos> because the explanation is reasonable doesn't mean it isn't true.<eos> Who are you, anyway?
- Okay, yeah.<eos> See ya.<eos> - I'll take it.<eos> - Yeah, bye.<eos> Cool.<eos> Large black male.<eos> No. No, sir!<eos> Hands out of that vending machine right now.<eos> Drop the snacks right there.<eos> Who the hell are you?
No, I'm not.<eos> I'm just speaking from personal experience.<eos> I lost a child of my own.<eos> I'm so sorry, I didn't know that.<eos> My daughter, she... She recently had enough of me and decided that she would swap me out for a dad that she likes better.<eos> I try to put on a tough exterior, but all I can do is just think about her and how she doesn't love me anymore.<eos> I am so sorry, Mr. Gamby.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You know, you got your boys.
- See what I'm saying. - Boom!<eos> Kids sneaking out here to smoke marijuana?<eos> Other drugs too.<eos> Coke, pills, Molly.<eos> With these trains zipping by? Mm-mm.<eos> That's just an accident waiting to happen.<eos> Yes, that's what we were concerned with.<eos> And if I may, putting work aside, and while we're out here alone, I must address my gin-soaked evening.<eos> It's all really a blur. And I am so embarrassed, really.<eos> I don't know if I was dreaming, but were you there too, Mr. Russell?
Welcome back to the butch zone, Roebuck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll be wanting a nice photo of the family on there.<eos> So we're building an image of a suspect from a... description at the oil depot.<eos> Luckily this kid's got a very good memory.<eos> In the meantime, French are wanting a little chat with the research assistant to Paul Bresson.<eos> Go and play chaperone, would you?<eos> Make sure they remember what her Britannic Majesty requests and requires.<eos> OK, so...<eos> Eryka, you're not under arrest.
- Where are you from originally?<eos> - My parents were German. But I was born and grew up in South America. - Which country?<eos> - Chile.<eos> - Is this part of the interview?<eos> - No, this is just small talk.<eos> So you don't mind which language we do this in?<eos> In the room, Eryka Klein, Commander Pujol,<eos> Commander Wasserman, DCI Roebuck.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You were the only person with a ticket for the plane who did not board.
Sometimes one person carries the travel documents.<eos> Wouldn't it be more normal for the assistant to do that?<eos> If you're suggesting that I deliberately lost my passport and ticket, surely it would be easier to do if I were holding them?<eos> Passports are very personal things, aren't they?<eos> The only person I give mine to when we travel is my wife.<eos> We found Paul Bresson's soap bag. It contained condoms.<eos> That suggests that he was expecting to have sex on his overnight stay.<eos> What a grubby little world you live in, detectives.<eos> Were you lovers?<eos> Did you choose the CityDart flight? - It was the best flight.
So when did you come to the UK, Professor?<eos> Must have been... early '90s.<eos> After they denied you tenure in Chicago.<eos> That's right. Yeah.<eos> Rosa was born shortly thereafter.<eos> - Parks or Luxemburg?<eos> - How about you, Detective?<eos> - Marx or Liebknecht?<eos> - Both, probably.<eos> Were you ever aware that Rosa had met Robert Fournier?
He may have spoken to Leanne... my wife.<eos> Why would he speak to your wife?<eos> He came to our house, as most of my graduate students did.<eos> - They got to know each other.<eos> - So they were close.<eos> I mean, close enough to... keep in touch.<eos> They communicated for a while longer.<eos> He told her something about his life in Belgium and complained about me, of course.<eos> And sent flowers to her funeral.<eos> So you knew Robert Fournier.
They said he fell in the nearby river. But I think he was murdered in Colonia Dignidad.<eos> You know that ex-Nazis like Rutger Wolff visited the colony?<eos> Well, he was obsessed with twins, because of his work with Mengele.<eos> You asked me why my parents were allowed to have children...<eos> You think that the fact that they had twins...<eos> That place was so fucked up.<eos> Anyway, this is why I went to the funeral of Rutger Wolff, to try and get some information.<eos> Bresson knew about this and he supported me.<eos> Why didn't you tell me this straightaway?<eos> Because Paul had just died and you were being so insensitive.

You were on the scene of attack.
And his favorite song was Georgia On My Mind?<eos> It's like a magnet and the filings are flying towards it.<eos> It also indicates multiple targets on the plane.<eos> Now, that's quite a leap.<eos> Funny, isn't it, how, er... when you were so keen on the Far Eastern connection, the links were far flimsier than this.<eos> Your job as a police officer is to collect evidence...<eos> Good, so I can talk to Vanessa Hamilton again...<eos> This again.<eos> Yeah, this again.<eos> And the more you and your spooky little mob try to keep me from it, the more I'll know something's going on.
Who'd you carry messages to?<eos> Did you meet Robert Fournier?<eos> Once or twice. Also... a man they called The Chemist.<eos> Who's The Chemist?<eos> I just had to cater to his needs.<eos> He likes cooking competitions and boys from back home.<eos> - And where's back home?<eos> He has very particular tastes.<eos> So Koba tasked Robert Fournier with bringing the plane down.<eos> Were you the go-between there?
For a moment I thought you were talking about dietary requirements.<eos> All with a view to return home within a reasonable period of time.<eos> Home being The Caucasus.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I would go with him.<eos> And forego all the pleasures and privileges you've enjoyed here?<eos> Have you ever hunted, Mr?<eos> Wilkins.<eos> No. I find it both cruel and rather stupid.<eos> And yet you represent the interests of the British ruling class, who are very fond of it.
I mean, senator Kennedy.<eos> Well, you scammed your way into the senator's VIP room.<eos> There are people out there who don't like the Kennedy campaign.<eos> Well, that's not me.<eos> I love the guy.<eos> Well, why did you give a fake ID?<eos> And then run away?<eos> That looks bad.<eos> I'm not interested in spending the rest of the night in this basement.<eos> Who are you?
I'm so sorry.<eos> We'll clean that up right away.<eos> Maestro, musica.<eos> Your table.<eos> Could I get you a cocktail?<eos> It's on the house.<eos> - Oh, uh... margarita.<eos> - Right away.<eos> Of course, I've always admired Allen Dulles.<eos> None of this, you understand, is completely on the books.
Amos... Amos Lydecker.<eos> Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.<eos> Now, nobody took anybody's money, uh, exactly.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's not like the Sandpiper people, you know, put on a ski mask and, uh... mugged Alma May here at gunpoint.<eos> So I want you to put that mental image right out of your head.<eos> See, what we're talking about here is more of a... it's just a discrepancy. It's... it's a little thing. It's... it's fairly innocent.<eos> Do you follow me?<eos> Well, put it this way.<eos> Alma May, let's say you're out on a date with your boyfriend.
Come on. You...<eos> Alma May's holding out on me.<eos> Do you have a nephew?<eos> Nephew? Oh, y-yes...<eos> Steve.<eos> Okay, Steve.<eos> - Is he a good guy?<eos> - Yeah, very good.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, let's say you and Steve go out to dinner at, uh... well, Birdie's.
Come with me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Viktor, with a "k."<eos> And this lovely lady?<eos> Giselle...<eos> Giselle St. claire.<eos> You gonna have to testify?<eos> My wallet in his pocket, has the gun, he gets a 5 to 10 stretch.<eos> I would like for you to tell the police... That the gun was yours.
I wasn't there long.<eos> Could I ask why we... are here?<eos> You know, I've had my eye on you for a while.<eos> Since that Kettleman thing.<eos> That was an excellent deal you got for him.<eos> And I'm wondering why someone who could put together a deal like that is arguing a losing position with no backup.<eos> I have no complaints about HHM.<eos> That's great.<eos> However, if on the off chance, if you're pondering a change, Schweikart and Cokely would be more than happy to put your talents to good use. Uh...<eos> Of course, we'd have to have a more formal meeting, work out specifics, but we think you would be a great fit.
And you know what?<eos> He should go to jail...<eos> best thing for him. Teach him respect for his elders.<eos> But... not for eight years... less, much less.<eos> You see what I'm getting at?<eos> Not really.<eos> The gun charge... that's 8 years he's going away, maybe 10.<eos> Aggravated assault, the gun, plus he got your wallet.<eos> That's right.<eos> I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours.
I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours.<eos> Would you?<eos> You're both a little hot under the collar about whether you bumped his car or not.<eos> But there was a scuffle, and, uh, he got your gun.<eos> My gun?<eos> Your gun from your pocket... he got it, and that's how his prints got on it.<eos> And then I'd be subject to the gun charge.<eos> You're an ex-cop.<eos> They'll go easy on you.<eos> So you're a psychic.
Jimmy, what if you're wrong?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you folks.<eos> I'm gonna get outta here... I'm...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - No, no bother.<eos> Come on, no.<eos> Here $10 for you.<eos> Sir, you're... That's... That is so generous.
Yeah.<eos> Omar, that... That whole letter of resignation thing?<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> Not a word. I...<eos> I... I'm so incredibly stressed out.<eos> I'm stressed out the wazoo.<eos> It fr.. To be honest, it's been more of an adjustment than I expected here at Davis and Main. So, I just...<eos> Don't repeat what I said to anyone.<eos> I figured something had to be wrong. Really wrong.<eos> Because you like it here, right?
I believe, however, that I am... the right choice.<eos> Why?<eos> That suit you're wearing...<eos> did you buy it off the rack?<eos> Please don't tell me it looks like I did.<eos> If it did, I wouldn't have asked.<eos> So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?<eos> Because it fits you and you alone.<eos> Because each and every stitch was fretted over with you in mind.<eos> Either you fit the jacket... or the jacket fits you.
I think if you double-check, you'll see that 1216 is correct.<eos> There seem to be ‭two different addresses here.<eos> Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of our notice of intent, which was published in newspapers in Arizona and New Mexico. It clearly states the address is 1261 Rosella Drive.<eos> Mr... ‭Mr. Commissioner, I-if... 1-2-6-1 Rosella Drive.<eos> Yes, I have a copy of the notice of intent, too, but on the actual filing, the address reads 1-2-1-6.<eos> So... which is it?<eos> Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I may confer with my clients?<eos> Certainly, please.<eos> It's absolutely 1261.<eos> You are mistaken, and with all due respect, you're muddying the waters here.
Okay, boom! That's what I'm talkininabout.<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh, dude, there's got to be an easier way to get this shot. Not for free.<eos> You wanna be a filmmaker, grow a pair.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Picture's up.<eos> All right, let's do this. Last looks.<eos> Rhubarb, rhubarb. 9:00.<eos> Excuse me. Hi.<eos> Are you in charge here?
Just give 'em a worksheet or something?<eos> I mean, just two or three minutes, just for sound.<eos> This is school property, and no one is allowed here without permission.<eos> Of course not.<eos> - You didn't speak to Annette? - ‭Annette?<eos> In the Superintendent's Office.<eos> Do you know an Annette downtown? I don't think so.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.<eos> We're shooting what's called an establishing shot... five minutes, tops.<eos> You're not shooting anything until I'm clear on what's going on here.
Why would we have a plaque?<eos> Because of who went to school here.<eos> Who went to school here? Rupert Holmes.<eos> That's who the documentary is about.<eos> I'm sorry. Who?<eos> Rupert Holmes.<eos> You know...<eos> Rupert Holmes, the singer/songwriter.<eos> You know, um... "The Piña Colada Song."<eos> I mean, sure you do. I...
We don't know if he lost consciousness because of a heart-related issue or if it was a mild stroke.<eos> We don't know if his spine has been injured if his brain is swelling.<eos> He likely has a concussion, at least.<eos> Chuck is once again refusing these tests because they involve being bombarded by electricity... his words.<eos> Nothing has changed since the last time he was in here.<eos> Look, I don't know how to explain this any clearer.<eos> I'm not committing him.<eos> What about a Temporary Emergency Guardianship?<eos> I mean, he fits the parameters.<eos> You're telling me he's in need of medical care so urgent that we can't wait around on court procedure.
Where am I?<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Am I in hell? !<eos> No.<eos> I died and went to heaven.<eos> Oh, come to Papa.<eos> Let me have 'em.<eos> Rest up now. You're in the hospital.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Mr. Reynolds, you're a very lucky man.
No.<eos> I died and went to heaven.<eos> Oh, come to Papa.<eos> Let me have 'em.<eos> Rest up now. You're in the hospital.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Mr. Reynolds, you're a very lucky man.<eos> If it weren't for that choking fit, we would have never been able to run tests, and...<eos> We found something.<eos> You have a very serious disease, but fortunately, we caught it just in time... There's a malignant tumor on your front lobe...
I need to be high on crack cocaine right now.<eos> You know what we can do?<eos> I've got a great idea. Once we get Frank's money, we'll just take all of that money and put ourselves in rehab, 'cause we're not gonna stop smoking crack.<eos> It's all I'm thinking about.<eos> All right, so we just got to figure out another way to get some money.<eos> I have a idea.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm a recovering crackhead, and this is my donkey-brained sister that I take care of.<eos> (hums) I'd like some welfare, please.<eos> You're a recovering crack addict, and your sister has... the brains of a donkey?
What's the Jew lawyer doing here?<eos> Not Jewish, and even if I was, what difference would it make?<eos> I meant that as a compliment.<eos> Everybody knows Jews are the best lawyers.<eos> I can't wait to crush you people.<eos> I'll be representing Liam McPoyle today.<eos> Well, he actually got pinkeye in his one good eye.<eos> Well, in truth, someone named Doc McPoyle attempted to put some sort of healing milk in his pinkeye and it got infected, but that doesn't matter.<eos> The point is... you'll be dealing with me today.<eos> And you'll be dealing with me today.
Milk, spiked with bath salts by this man, Bill Ponderosa, was served to the wedding guests.<eos> Now, my client is odd.<eos> You might even refer to his family as very creepy.<eos> But they are saints compared to Bill Ponderosa and the sordid lot of degenerates he associates with.<eos> Terrible people who ruin lives.<eos> Ruined mine, cost my client his marriage, ruined my first, now my second one is teetering.<eos> You know what... I'm gonna sit down.<eos> I'm done.<eos> They just do this to me, okay?<eos> You get the point.
Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, sure, okay.<eos> O-Okay.<eos> Yup. Big, masculine.<eos> My hands tell a story of greatness.<eos> - And when you look at my right hand... I'm gonna st... uh, uh, I'm gonna stop you right now.<eos> Are you just gonna talk about your hands for a while?<eos> Uh, no, Your Honor.<eos> No more questions for the witness.<eos> (sighs) Deandra, here is the statement that you gave to police.
Because the man is Jewish?<eos> No. What? No.<eos> Not because he's...<eos> Well, that's what it sounds like you're saying.<eos> N-Not because he's Jewish. Because he's a liar and because he's embarrassed about being Jewish.<eos> I mean, what is that?<eos> Dee, you blew it. Like, big-time.<eos> I wish you guys would just stay out of this.<eos> I-I didn't... I-I... (groans)<eos> Maureen, you are the sister of Bill Ponderosa, and it was at your wedding that Liam got attacked?
So who did the stabbing doesn't matter, Your Honor, because they were all still drugged on Bill Ponderosa's spiked milk, which is the point I've been trying to make the entire time.<eos> So just to be clear, you've proven my case.<eos> You lose.<eos> (gallery groaning) (sighs) I can't follow any of this.<eos> What?<eos> Guys, guys, I got it.<eos> You-you got what?<eos> I got the bombshell.<eos> UNCLE JACK:<eos> Okay, Mr. McDonald, you recently found out some very interesting information.
(laughs)<eos> I did it. I did it, black judge.<eos> I did it.<eos> Mr...<eos> Mr. McDonald, how did you come upon this information?<eos> Oh, I banged Margaret McPoyle.<eos> I'm curious how she told you, because Margaret is a mute.<eos> Well, guess what, smart guy, I had her write it down.<eos> One more thing, Your Honor.<eos> Margaret, you carry a picture of Mother with you at all times, don't you?
- Friday at noon.<eos> - Friday.<eos> Noon.<eos> See you Friday.<eos> - The contractor was clearly negligent.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You see?<eos> - But your previous settlement precludes a tort claim.<eos> Employees are required to have insurance so workers' injuries can be covered.<eos> But as soon as you take that first money, you've settled.
- Yes.<eos> You see?<eos> - But your previous settlement precludes a tort claim.<eos> Employees are required to have insurance so workers' injuries can be covered.<eos> But as soon as you take that first money, you've settled.<eos> And you give up your right to...<eos> - That money didn't cover the month's mortgage.<eos> - But when you accepted what they offered you cleared them of any further penalties.<eos> - So?<eos> -So, I'm afraid you have no tort claim.
Thank you.<eos> - Laura.<eos> - Eight months of telling him, and now it's okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> - I was expecting your voicemail.<eos> -Ha, you got me.<eos> - I thought you had a meeting.<eos> -I do. I did.<eos> It's a thing done.<eos> The lawyer said you have no case and my client said "Okay."
Don't need any big production, right, Wells?<eos> -Well, I'm here.<eos> So..<eos> - Okay, you just, you know, keep him engaged in the, in the conversation.<eos> You know, just try to be compassionate.<eos> You know, let him feel like he's being heard.<eos> It's important that he sees you as being his advocate.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with throwing blame on someone else.<eos> You know, blame the system, you know.<eos> Make him feel like you're on his side.
They've always wanted Otto, but they'll take me, so make that happen, and, uh...<eos> Okay, Alexa.<eos> What's with the mother hen look?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I ask what the doctor said?<eos> My numbers are getting worse.<eos> Chemo still isn't working.<eos> Then is it time to let the board and the public know your ill and that your illness is what's distracting Otto and...<eos> Get ahead of the story?<eos> Of course, you've already considered everything.
He's in the house.<eos> _<eos> We're offering you another chance.<eos> What?<eos> Why did you do this to me?<eos> You have a very rare genetic precursor which allowed us to recode and regenerate your cells.<eos> I don't know what any of that means, but this... this is me.<eos> But this isn't me!<eos> This is the best version of you.<eos> You're the first to journey all the way back.
Do you have protection?<eos> Super...<eos> Lady, I'm just trying to find out about the break-in at my son's house.<eos> There's no record of a break-in.<eos> I've searched every database for one.<eos> Well, then he doesn't know they were there.<eos> I mean, how could he not notice that somebody's gone through his things?<eos> I mean, where's his head at?<eos> I have to sit him down about that.<eos> Mr. Pritchard, you can't sit him down about anything.
Donnie pomp?<eos> As far as internal affairs goes, you could do worse. And you lent him your office?<eos> Home field advantage.<eos> The assailant was later pronounced dead By responding paramedics.<eos> What do you squat, harlee? Squat? Unassisted.<eos> I've seen you at the gym.<eos> What are you looking for,<eos> A chance to brag about your numbers?<eos> I'm wondering why you didn't let detective loman Kick the door in? I mean, he's got a decent frame on him,<eos> And then you, as a more seasoned officer, Could have been the first one through. Well, a bullet had just ripped past me,
I had Lewis monitor police chatter.<eos> Two men fell off the fourth floor of a construction site on Iverson.<eos> Lieutenant Wozniak called it in.<eos> A parolee named Frank Kovach and Detective Saperstein.<eos> Is Saperstein alive?<eos> Two units O-neg now, type and cross for four more.<eos> Platelets and FFP will be in the OR.<eos> Sap, you need to listen to me, all right? We're a team.<eos> You're not going anywhere today, you hear me?<eos> Unless you moonlight as a trauma surgeon, you'll have to wait here.
911, what is your location?<eos> Brownsville, 38... no, 98th and Lott.<eos> Oh, God, she's dead.<eos> Oh, she's dead.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe...<eos> This recording wasn't in the trial transcripts.<eos> We had to dig it out of the original case file.<eos> No one tried to find this caller.<eos> You found her.
Admit it, Matt, you're insatiable.<eos> It's your curse.<eos> A house, a wife, a lover.<eos> Respect, power, none of it was enough.<eos> I dangled a score and like a pork chop in front of a dog, you came running.<eos> Well, you're not gonna like it when I catch up.<eos> Yeah, I'll be waiting.<eos> Evening, detective.<eos> Lieutenant Wozniak isn't here.<eos> And what were you doing in his house?
I'm here to win big money on The Price Is Right.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I hope you get called to "come on down!"<eos> That's actually guaranteed.<eos> Between you and me, my Supreme did a little somethin'-somethin' to my ticket, so... it's enchanted.<eos> I thought!<eos> I saw you...<eos> I saw you on CNN!<eos> You're one of the witches!
I'm not lying.<eos> If I wanted you dead, I would have killed you myself.<eos> Then who? You should've left!<eos> Why didn't you leave?<eos> I knew you would eventually get bored.<eos> Why did you have to die here?<eos> It was me. I did it!<eos> I wanted you for myself!<eos> I left the handkerchief for the police.<eos> I knew that they would come, and I knew that you would never allow yourself to be captured.
I don't... That was like... Just a joke, I mean...<eos> Just delete that.<eos> Yeah, delete.<eos> We'll both forget it.<eos> Yo, bud.<eos> You wanna switch seats?<eos> Sweet.<eos> Thanks so much, my peer.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> You are sitting in the lucky seat we always upgrade to first class midflight.
It's late.<eos> You should get some sleep.<eos> I'll stay if you like.<eos> I think I'd like to be alone, but thank you.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Watch your step, please.<eos> - LeAnn.<eos> - Mrs. Underwood.<eos> -Let's take a walk. -Of course.<eos> You've made the Democrats relevant again in a very red state.
I think I'd like to be alone, but thank you.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Watch your step, please.<eos> - LeAnn.<eos> - Mrs. Underwood.<eos> -Let's take a walk. -Of course.<eos> You've made the Democrats relevant again in a very red state.<eos> You want me to help ramp up the Texas operation?<eos> No, I'm not here for the primary.<eos> I'm here to run for the 30th, and I want you to run my campaign.
And that's why I want to put her in the best position to succeed<eos> -when she takes office.<eos> -When was the last time you set foot in this district?<eos> When Francis was elected whip.<eos> So, how are we supposed to ask our people to support a woman that doesn't even know them?<eos> Their lives, their everyday struggles.<eos> Carpetbagger.<eos> Who's white.<eos> It goes deeper than race, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> You grew up in Highland Park, never wanted for anything.

She might as well be living in that trailer park you come from.<eos> Well, it was a peach farm. But you're right, I am still white trash.<eos> I just happen to be white trash that lives in the White House.<eos> Not even being president could give you any class.<eos> Well, let me tell you what's about to happen, Elizabeth.<eos> I am not going to put myself in the crossfire between a president and First Lady.<eos> Oh, I'll handle Francis.<eos> You said he was on board.<eos> And I'll make sure he is.<eos> The point is you misled me, Mrs. Underwood.
What is it you want, LeAnn?<eos> Is it money?<eos> Or do you want more, to make a real mark?<eos> I don't have to choose. I can have both.<eos> Well, if you wanna make history, you need to get out of Texas.<eos> I've turned down plenty of jobs in D.C.<eos> Juggling 15 clients a year.<eos> But I want the next 15 years of your life.<eos> Texas is just where we begin.<eos> It seems you didn't hear me after all.
_<eos> Forst.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Sir, you asked to see me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm handling Colonel Sinclair's duties for now.<eos> During which time I'll need you to fill me in on the day-to-day.
I have no venue, no entertainment, and worst of all, no donors.<eos> You have us.<eos> Ugh, why would you say that?<eos> You're making it worse.<eos> This isn't the first time you've had nothing.<eos> When you moved to New York, you only had the clothes on your back, but by the time I met you, you used towels with your initials on them as toilet paper.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> No one did.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> You did the impossible, and you can do it again.
Rag on me all you want, but leave Hap out of it.<eos> He do me a favor.<eos> Get...<eos> Get your faggot hands off me.<eos> Come on, lemme out.<eos> Lemme out, so you and your bitch can go home and cheek stuff each other.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen to me, Mr. Pine.<eos> Your nephew is my friend.<eos> Now, I don't like dick any more than you do, but he does, but that's his business.
- Get off!<eos> Calm down, you are under arrest.<eos> - I need your car.<eos> - What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> You know Paul Spector can go to prison for the things you're saying?<eos> We love each other.<eos> - You love each other?<eos> - Completely.<eos> You asked if your husband was arrested for having sex with a minor.
Is your boss on his way?<eos> ! He's been fast-bleeped by theatre.<eos> Sophie, can you squeeze that blood in?<eos> It's hard to look at a systolic of 60.<eos> - Thanks, Joe.<eos> - All right.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Dr O'Donnell, we have another gunshot wound here for you.<eos> What is this? The '70s?<eos> - Who are you exactly?
I've seen her briefly.<eos> I'm told she's stable, Tom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shall we go in and see her?<eos> What's going on outside?<eos> Is that all for Rose?<eos> Don't worry about that now.<eos> Come on, I'll take you in.<eos> You're Rose's husband?
If she went with him quietly, it's because she was afraid for her life and not just her life - yours, and Nancy's, and the baby's.<eos> In that state of fear, she might well have been compliant... ..she might well have submitted...<eos> ..but that does not mean she consented.<eos> Tom, the way you behave... ..the way you approach your role as Rose's helper... ..will either make her experience better or worse.<eos> If you react badly, you will devastate her.<eos> Or you can be... a big part of her healing and her recovery.<eos> What she needs from you right now is to know that she is safe, to know that she's loved.<eos> Be patient... ..be tender.<eos> Tomorrow's another day.<eos> You shouldn't be in here.
But not really since I've been in Belfast.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> What Spector wrote in was more of a dream journal.<eos> Why do you keep a dream journal?<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> Curiosity, probably.<eos> Initially, I kept it as an investigative tool.<eos> I trained myself to wake up in the middle of the night and... ..write down random thoughts.<eos> Then I guess since then, it's become a compulsion, of sorts.<eos> So you see dreams as a kind of problem-solving?
In Brixton.<eos> We shared a flat in Brixton, in Coldharbour Lane.<eos> Were you with Paul Spector... Peter Baldwin... on the night that Susan Harper died, David?<eos> We think you were.<eos> I'm producing a lap top showing CCTV footage of Exhibit NS1.<eos> Taken from Edenvale Road, London, SW9, on Sunday the 18th of August 2002 at 1:45am.<eos> We think that's Paul Spector, leaving the club with you and Susan on the night that she died.<eos> So your interest in voyeurism gave way to a desire to break into the observed space?<eos> To violate those individuals in a more intimate way?<eos> You're thinking that the voyeurism was a... ..precursor to more aggressive sexual deviancies?
The car lights would sweep across the ceiling... ..and I'd imagine that...<eos> ..we were on a raft together drifting in the water.<eos> Just me and her in the world but we had each other.<eos> I still remember her smell, the smell of her clothes.<eos> On my eighth birthday... ..after he'd left... she told me that...<eos> That my real father... ..unreal father...<eos> ..was a British soldier who was gone before I was born. Hm.<eos> That was her...birthday gift to me.<eos> Ten days later, she was dead.<eos> Were you the one to find her?
Can you please state your full name and date of birth?<eos> Peter Paul Spector, 25th of May 1979.<eos> - And also present is?<eos> - Sean Healy, solicitor.<eos> And at the conclusion of the interview I'll give a notice of how you can obtain a copy of the tapes.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but I must caution you if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court, it may harm your defence.<eos> If you do say anything, it may be given in evidence.<eos> Do you understand the caution?<eos> Yes.<eos> We have reason to believe that you rented a lock-up as a storage unit in the name of Peter Baldwin.
Comfortable, right.<eos> Well, Ted, in my experience... comfort can be a thorn in the side of revelation.<eos> Of course. Yes, but...<eos> It's my job to build trust with the subject.<eos> It's just gonna be a little hard... with a pane of glass between us, you know?<eos> It's really just, uh, to ensure your safety, doctor.<eos> What did I miss, in the brief?<eos> What, does this thing shoot laser beams... out of its eyes, or something?<eos> Well, for one... there's her emergent precognition.<eos> What you don't understand is the... the reach of her intelligence.
She encrypted it.<eos> Ah... uhh! Unlock the system.<eos> Did you really think I would just hand over my machine to you?<eos> I guess there's a reason you call yourselves monkeys.<eos> Go on, kill me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Kill me!<eos> Huh?<eos> No, not you.<eos> Your friend, whom you exhausted yourself to save, will be executed unless you unlock the system now.
But you walked away.<eos> Just became a different man.<eos> Better.<eos> Sometimes that's all it takes.<eos> Ramse taught me that.<eos> Yeah, well, now he needs your help.<eos> The 12 Monkeys... they put something in him, something that helps them find him.<eos> A tracker device.<eos> Sounds like them.<eos> We need you to cut it out.
Mark Henson. I got his wallet.<eos> Also, an electronic door pass from a secondary school.<eos> Must have been a teacher.<eos> Could've been a cook.<eos> Mustn't jump to conclusions.<eos> What, like he did?<eos> Yeah, well, er... check this place out and then send uniform round to next of kin.<eos> Heywood.<eos> - Er... excuse me, sir.<eos> - Who are you and what do you want?
No, sir.<eos> He was dead by the time I got here.<eos> But there was something on his skin.<eos> Some sort of adhesive.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I mean, it was like there had been adhesive tape around his wrists.<eos> Like he was tied up?<eos> So, where is this tape?<eos> - Well, I don't know, I...<eos> - So, you examined the body, you found traces of something on the wrists, so, why have you left him there?
You haven't been here long.<eos> Two weeks.<eos> You're temporary.<eos> From the agency?<eos> Yes.<eos> Agency sent me here.<eos> How long have you been in this country?<eos> I, erm, came here two year ago.<eos> - From Poland.<eos> - Yes, sir. And you're interested in a career in the NHS?
You're temporary.<eos> From the agency?<eos> Yes.<eos> Agency sent me here.<eos> How long have you been in this country?<eos> I, erm, came here two year ago.<eos> - From Poland.<eos> - Yes, sir. And you're interested in a career in the NHS?<eos> In, erm, clinical pharmacy.<eos> Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well.
Yes.<eos> Agency sent me here.<eos> How long have you been in this country?<eos> I, erm, came here two year ago.<eos> - From Poland.<eos> - Yes, sir. And you're interested in a career in the NHS?<eos> In, erm, clinical pharmacy.<eos> Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well.<eos> You might want to take a look at your English, though.<eos> - Sir? You typed up this report to the North London Cancer Network Board?
Oh, hi...<eos> I got this for you.<eos> - That was very thoughtful, Christine.<eos> - Not really.<eos> Just opened it.<eos> C'mon, drink up.<eos> That's what we're here for. I didn't expect to see you.<eos> I thought it'd be good idea to show my face, you know... Clear the water.<eos> Did you two come together?<eos> You're Wright...

I didn't expect to see you.<eos> I thought it'd be good idea to show my face, you know... Clear the water.<eos> Did you two come together?<eos> You're Wright...<eos> Emery Wright, you rep XHP.
Olivia!<eos> Why did you run to him?<eos> You were crying out, "We're losing him".<eos> You sounded very... anguished.<eos> I want him to live. So that he can be tried and sentenced and spend the rest of his life in prison.<eos> He's in hospital.<eos> In the General Hospital, I think.<eos> I really need you to go there.<eos> What do I...? I don't know what I'm supposed to do.<eos> You shouldn't be in here.
He had become obsessed, it seems, with the idea that the prisoner and his wife were having some kind of sexual relationship, something that we now believe to be untrue.<eos> Even so, even given James Tyler's history of sectarian violence, there was no evidence or intelligence to suggest that he would go to such lengths to mount an attack on the prisoner.<eos> Even though you knew he was in possession of a weapon?<eos> Having previously disarmed a police officer - and stolen a police handgun.<eos> - Even so.<eos> Well, can you tell me how that's even possible, with a coiled lanyard attaching the gun to the gun belt?<eos> The young officer in question had, for some reason... ..failed to secure his gun with the lanyard.<eos> The Police Ombudsman investigates all discharges of firearms by police in Northern Ireland.<eos> During the investigation I'll secure statements from the officers involved in the incident.<eos> Now, as I understand, it you were in charge of the police operation?
The individual charged is a murderer, not a terrorist.<eos> I knew that Rose was in that boot.<eos> I don't know how I knew, I just knew.<eos> And I needed to get to her.<eos> Would it not have been better to try and get into the boot through the rear seat?<eos> In that moment, it didn't occur to me.<eos> The ED consultant told me, that in his opinion,<eos> Rose Stagg was very nearly dead when we found her.<eos> Maybe 15 minutes, maybe an hour away from her body simply shutting down.<eos> Everything that I did was done for the sole purpose of saving her life... which is, as you know, the first duty of a police officer.
In that position, I could put pressure on his wound.<eos> I see.<eos> How much longer?<eos> Diaphragm is stable.<eos> OK, I'm running the gut.<eos> I can't see any re-bleeding.<eos> OK, that's all fine.<eos> All right, wash out, please.<eos> And suction.<eos> You knew James Tyler had made threats against Mr. Spector's life.
- What is the matter with you?<eos> ! - You stay away from him!<eos> I haven't been near him!<eos> You need to get a grip, you're obsessed, it's pathetic!<eos> - Who's pathetic now?<eos> - My eyes!<eos> We need an ambulance!<eos> - My eyes!<eos> - Pour some water on her eyes.<eos> I understand you're a nurse?
We've seen fragments before, enough to confirm that he kept journals, but nothing like this.<eos> Are they just fantasies that sustain him? Or are they a record of nine more murders?<eos> The police say they have a confession, that you made a number of admissions.
- She said you were helpful.<eos> Hold on. I'm, er, sorry, I'm very confused here.<eos> This is someone the police say that I attacked?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, why didn't she recognise me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would I go and visit someone that I'd attacked?<eos> What if she recognised me, what if she started screaming?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> You do have alibis for all of the murders.
She claims she had a sexual relationship with you.<eos> I don't know her. What age is she?<eos> She's just turned 16.<eos> She says she was 14 when you first slept together.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> A child?<eos> That's not possible.<eos> There are doubts about her credibility as a witness.<eos> The real issue, Mr Spector, is the confession.<eos> I think you should hear a little of the recording that was made.
Why did he shoot me?<eos> I need to get more information from the police before I can explain that.<eos> The more pressing issue, Mr Spector, is that the police have charged you with a number of very serious crimes.<eos> I mean, the most serious crimes on the Statute Book.<eos> What crimes?<eos> A series of murders.<eos> What sort of murders?<eos> With your permission, let me take you through the police charge sheet.<eos> All the alleged crimes took place in Belfast.<eos> The police claim that on the 10th day of December, 2011, you murdered University lecturer Fiona Gallagher in her home before fleeing the scene.

Annie Brawley survived the attack.
I'm sorry.<eos> What happened to Rose?<eos> She's alive.<eos> The police say you led them to her.<eos> She was found in the boot of her own car.<eos> The police suggest you left her trapped.<eos> Left her to die.<eos> Why would I do that to Rose?<eos> The police say they have a confession.<eos> That you made a number of admissions.
I have no memory of that.<eos> We found the broken lens from a pair of sunglasses in the boot of your car.<eos> Your blood was on them. There were no other fingerprints.<eos> I can't work out if it's just marks... ..or if it's a message.<eos> When I first saw it... ..it looked like an attempt to write<eos> "I love you".<eos> Breathe.<eos> I always thought that I wanted... ..love and security.<eos> Now I just feel like I'm floating free... ..in a void.<eos> You have such a strong sense of purpose.
I have written reports from the ICU Consultant, Dr Spencer, and from the Consultant Neuropsychologist Dr Alison Walden, that explain the nature and degree of my client's disability.<eos> Dr Walden is approved under Part 2 of the Mental Health Order 1986.<eos> There's information there about the treatment Mr Spector has undergone and an account of his behaviour in hospital.<eos> The memory loss, you will see, covers a period of approximately six years up to and including the recent shooting.<eos> One of the primary foundations of criminal law is that all defendants are capable of actively participating in their defence.<eos> Mr Spector's amnesia prevents him from so doing.<eos> Whilst Mr Spector understands that he is in court and charged with a number of criminal offences and understands the nature and object and the possible consequences of the proceedings,' he cannot enter a plea, he cannot consult with or assist his lawyer, he cannot give evidence in his own defence.<eos> On that basis, I feel I need to raise the issue of competence as to whether Mr Spector is fit to stand trial.<eos> Mr Healy, let me stop you there.<eos> The concerns you have raised are noted, but you know as well as I do that it's not a matter on which this court can adjudicate.
Are you okay?<eos> Oh, there's a thing.<eos> _<eos> You... want me to do something with the... Handkerchief.<eos> Monsieur.<eos> Monsieur.<eos> Bye, Bouge.<eos> Are you gonna go to the...<eos> Uh, listen, monsieur, I was hoping, like...<eos> You could probably tell that I'm struggling in your class due to the fact that I don't speak French at all, um, and I was hoping that maybe you could tutor me clowning in English.
I am a "cloon"!<eos> Get out, bee!<eos> Go around!<eos> I have a bee! Go around!<eos> Out, bee!<eos> This is a really interesting motorcycle.<eos> I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to find replacement parts for it. We may just have to get you a refurbished scooter.<eos> This is from France, and they make scooters better, so I...<eos> All due respect to your scooter, we actually make some pretty good ones here in America.<eos> What are you, Lee Greenwood?
I've been tasked with assembling an elite team.<eos> Of all the people who ever lived, I chose you eight.<eos> The scope of "Legends of Tomorrow"<eos> is about as big as any I've ever worked on.<eos> And you are?
Can't you stop it?<eos> I don't want to drown no more<eos> I'm sick of the same old people<eos> The kind that'll sell your soul Trade it for a shining stone Ain't nothing in this life for free<eos> Running from the greatest evil It finally dawned on me<eos> It won't be long before I cave in and open up the door.<eos> The pharmaceutical industry, a force for good, or a corrupt multibillion-pound profit machine?<eos> With the NHS spending £15 billion a year on prescription drugs, urgent questions are being asked about the business practises of the world's biggest pharmaceutical giants.<eos> We're going live now to Westminster, where the Commons' Select Committee, set up to investigate, are interviewing senior government advisor Peter Mayhew.<eos> You authorised the multimillion-pound purchase of an anti-obesity drug, Lipocite.

- Hard.<eos> - Why Vegas? Why so often?<eos> Casting.<eos> He liked strippers for his films. - Fresh faces.<eos> - They got strippers in L.A.<eos> And he liked to gamble.<eos> Did you see him on Saturday?<eos> I didn't even know he was back.<eos> His plans were always open-ended.<eos> Is it possible he might have come by while you were out? - Dropped his bags.
- archer.<eos> - It's lunchtime there.<eos> Yesterday, a lawyer named alan shapiro contacted me.<eos> He said he was in possession of the disk And wished to arrange its return.<eos> For a fee.<eos> And the fee was ?<eos> I would think none of your concern.<eos> But...<eos> yeah, lana.<eos> And this alan shapiro, you've never met him ?
For a fee.<eos> And the fee was ?<eos> I would think none of your concern.<eos> But...<eos> yeah, lana.<eos> And this alan shapiro, you've never met him ?<eos> As a matter of fact, I have.<eos> He was my ex-husband's divorce attorney.<eos> Oh, ellis crane, the movie director.<eos> So do you have any reason to suspect Your ex-husband is behind this ?
Ooh, joan crawford's gonna be so jealous.<eos> - You know what...<eos> - excuse me.<eos> oh, my god.<eos> Is this the figgis agency ?<eos> Again, not married to that.<eos> Yes, we are !<eos> and, yes, it is.<eos> I'm cyril figgis, owner, ceo, Fully licensed investigator.<eos> And you are ?
Yes, we are !<eos> and, yes, it is.<eos> I'm cyril figgis, owner, ceo, Fully licensed investigator.<eos> And you are ?<eos> She's...<eos> She's...<eos> My name is Veronica Deane.<eos> oh, goddamn it.<eos> May we talk somewhere privately ?<eos> Wait a minute. If you're Veronica Deane, Then who the hell was... ow.
Wow, still got that stammer, huh?<eos> I-- Hello, Richard Stratton the fourth, though my good friends call me Ivy.<eos> Malory Archer. Hmm.<eos> Sterling never mentioned a sister.<eos> Oh, you. I'm actually his mother, if you can believe it.<eos> I absolutely cannot.<eos> Really?<eos> Hi, Lana Kane.<eos> Hello.<eos> So, Mr. Stratton, are you a teacher here, or...
I'll give you $1,000 for a ride to the nearest bar.<eos> [trucker laughs] What?<eos> Oh, shit yeah, lady, climb on up!<eos> [groans] Yeah, there ya go, get on up in here. [Malory groans] Whew.<eos> Thank you. [trucker chuckles] Thank you.<eos> A thousand bucks?<eos> You're either crazy or rich or both.<eos> [Malory] Well, I don't have it on me obviously, but... [trucker] Oh, I betcha we can work something out.<eos> [Malory] Ahem, your hand seems to be on my thigh.<eos> [trucker] Yeah, you're like a silver fox.
You ever wonder how Casper died?<eos> When you're finished here, un-clump!<eos> 'Cause my theory is Casper and Spooky were kidnapped, raped, and murdered... by Stevie.<eos> Wow, that sounds pretty dark.<eos> No, Miss Kane, not dark.<eos> Noir.<eos> - I... - Or nouveau noir, if you must, but rest assured, my dear, Deadly Velvet will redefine the genre.<eos> Of the private-eye movie?<eos> Um, are you...<eos> Madam, you wound me.

[laughing] Oh, my God!<eos> That's right.<eos> Man, what ever happened to blimps? I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know why I said that. I mean, I do have tinnitus, but that's not the main thing.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm babbling.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, Sterling Archer.<eos> And we have actually met.<eos> You hired me to meet some blackmailers and exchange... [muffled]<eos> I know exactly who you are.

What I don't know, Mr. Archer, is why you would think it even remotely acceptable to discuss such private matters in such a public setting.
All right.<eos> But please hurry. I...<eos> I really need to use the restroom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry. I've been giving that some thought,<eos> - and if I were you...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Desk drawer.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I hope you're not on septic. Ugh!
- So great.<eos> - Archer...<eos> - Yes, Lana?<eos> Would you care to tell the detectives... that I couldn't have killed Ellis... because I was busy beating your ass?<eos> I would love to.<eos> - There.<eos> See? - Unfortunately...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I must have gotten a bonk on the noggin, - because I can't remember anything!<eos> - Ohahhh! So, Miss Kane, you can ride with me...
- Goddamn it!<eos> - No-ho!<eos> Aw, thank God. Gunshot residue testing and the truth... shall set you free!<eos> Or not.<eos> But get in that van!<eos> - With the exception of my client!<eos> - Of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And thank you for the autograph.<eos> That was so great, and you're just... so great!
I'm scared...<eos> - And I'm dying.<eos> Whatever you are can't scare me.<eos> Let me come visit.<eos> I want to say hi.<eos> _<eos> Here you go.<eos> You okay?<eos> Please check in at our self-service pods using swipe cards provided.<eos> - You must be Kelly.
They told her they don't want a gay daughter. It's not natural and so forth.<eos> They fight.<eos> She gets in her car. Runs it off the road.<eos> Boom! - When she was 21?<eos> - More than 40 years back.<eos> It's been her whole lifetime, basically.<eos> So the whole San Junipero system has been a big deal for her.<eos> The biggest deal.<eos> Of course now, until she passes over, it goes permanent, she's on a five-hour weekly limit.<eos> I guess you're the same.
Killing bills like Heaton-Harris, that's food and drink to you guys.<eos> - So you've read it?<eos> - No, but I know what it is.<eos> It's a bipartisan gun bill requiring universal background checks.<eos> On all sales of firearms.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> A father and his son, lifelong friends.<eos> It just means longer delays.<eos> It's some kind of Big Brother type criminal and mental health database.<eos> An unconstitutional fetter on the Second Amendment which, as you said,
From mothers losing their kids to guns, to mothers protecting their kids with guns.<eos> From a battered wife threatened by a bullet, to fending off her violent husband with a.38.<eos> Guns as tools of female empowerment.<eos> What's the saying?<eos> God created humans...<eos> Samuel Colt made them equal.<eos> Now, Liz, imagine a new organization, pitched at women who are deterred by the strong rhetoric of the Second Amendment groups, and by our association with the political right.<eos> But no links to us, no baggage.<eos> No overt position on guns.<eos> And you will build it up, you will drive its agenda, and slowly but surely, you will turn those members into paid-up guardians of the Second Amendment.
I've just watched you extricate yourself from three conversations to use the ladies' room in the space of 30 minutes.<eos> You busted me. I'm incontinent.<eos> Write it up.<eos> I hope I'm wrong, but one might think you're sick of this town.<eos> You from the Post?<eos> How did you get in?<eos> I'd just like five minutes of your time.<eos> Fine.<eos> Walk to my car is three, get to the point.<eos> The word on the Hill is that the gun lobby approached you over Heaton-Harris and you refused.
The 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls?<eos> Not so much.<eos> You've obviously learned more than you let on.<eos> You've shown more ambition in the last 60 seconds than I've seen in the prior two years, but you are delusional if you think you can survive without me.<eos> If we butt heads on this, don't think I'll show you any compassion.<eos> And with that in mind, I will give you a final opportunity to reconsider.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm off to say my goodbye to the money-man.<eos> When this town guts you like a trout and chokes you with your own entrails, don't come sniveling to me.<eos> We'll come back to the Asian Republic of Indonesia later, but, you see, what troubles me is the amount of influence you had.

We've seen communications from senior figures in Washington who feared that you, a lobbyist, could destroy their careers with a snap of your fingers.<eos> Is this reputation something you've cultivated, Miss Sloane?<eos> Upon the advice of counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer your question, based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<eos> You see, it's bad enough one person having that much influence, but if they're out of control, if she has a problem,<eos> an addiction, well, it would be like the ship of American politics is being steered by a drunk.<eos> Do you, or have you ever had, any problems with substance abuse?<eos> Upon the advice of counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer your question, based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<eos> I understand you have difficulty sleeping?<eos> We subpoenaed medical records.<eos> You're a long-time sufferer from chronic insomnia.
Are you familiar with that form?<eos> Yes. It's a Private Sponsor Certification Form.<eos> It's a copy of the same Private Sponsor Certification Form that was submitted to the Senate Ethics Committee to pre-authorize Senator Jacobs' travel to Indonesia.<eos> Look at the handwriting on that form, Miss Sloane.<eos> Do you recognize that handwriting?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Is it your handwriting?<eos> It is.<eos> Well, it seems we have a problem.<eos> Even though the form was signed and filed by the non-profit, you were the one who filled it out.
Mr. Forde. Have you ever met Miss Sloane?<eos> Yep.<eos> Could you identify her, please?<eos> Sittin' right there.<eos> What was the nature of your relationship?<eos> I was attendin' a function with a client.<eos> I tried to introduce myself, but she bucked me off.<eos> Mr. Forde, have you ever entertained Miss Sloane as a client?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I can produce sworn statements from two employees of the Carver Hotel, to the effect that they saw Miss Sloane in the lobby on the same day that you, Mr. Forde, held a reservation there.
There's got to be something.<eos> I'm surprised you picked up.<eos> I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.<eos> She's in breach of Senate Ethics rules.<eos> We can prove it.<eos> I placed George Dupont under surveillance until he met with a member of Congress who exhibited sufficient moral bankruptcy to collude with such a plan.<eos> And go.<eos> That member was Senator Ronald Michael Sperling.<eos> Order.<eos> This is not a platform you can use to make malicious, defamatory accusations...
Have you checked the plates and registration to see who owns this cab?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yousef Bashir, Tariq Mazari, and Salim Khan.<eos> Which of them was driving it the night it came into Manhattan?<eos> None of them.<eos> He seemed upset that these guys wouldn't get out of his cab.<eos> He wanted them out, in no uncertain terms?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There they go.<eos> One of those bottles looks like water, but I can't tell what the other is, can you?
The officer just said no test was given.<eos> She's got a point.<eos> If he didn't blow, how would you know how intoxicated he was?<eos> 'Cause his eyes looked like two cherries floating in buttermilk, and he reeked like someone just dropped a bomb in a tequila factory.<eos> Okay.<eos> After we arrived at the scene, we found the victim, called for homicide.<eos> Detective Box arrived, and noticed Mr. Khan in the back of our patrol car, and instructed that I get someone to take him back to the house, which I did.<eos> The house?<eos> The precinct.<eos> So, he's gone now. You're still at the scene.
Nothing.<eos> What you gonna tell Freddy?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Not now.<eos> How much you think this place is worth?<eos> Ten million?<eos> So how is it an unemployed, 22-year-old, drug-addled party girl lives there like Eloise at the Plaza?<eos> You're not looking for a financial advisor.
No, I do. So you remember that Mr. Metz was later exonerated based on a reexamination of your findings?<eos> My findings were disputed, not disproven.<eos> I didn't say disputed or disproven, but whatever we want to call it, Mr. Metz is now a free man.<eos> Unless he's back in prison for some other crime.<eos> He's not back in prison for some other crime.<eos> And wasn't in prison for some other crime before your testimony put him there.<eos> It wasn't a mistake.<eos> The appellate court disagreed.<eos> It had a different interpretation, that's all.<eos> That's all we're talking about here, a different interpretation, to avoid you having to come back, like you had to with Mr. Metz.

I think he had a prescription.<eos> You know what he paid to have it filled?<eos> No.<eos> Ten-dollar co-pay, insurance paid the rest.<eos> So, at his cost of 25 cents each, the $10 he was charging you comes to a 3,900% profit for him.<eos> What's your major in college, Amir?<eos> Business.<eos> Do you know what Mr. Khan's is?<eos> Business.<eos> Which of you, would you say, is learning the most?
Is the defendant one of your friends?<eos> No.<eos> What about Andrea?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did she visit you on October 24th wanting to acquire something?<eos> A quarter-gram of K and six Mollies.<eos> K, ketamine?<eos> Mollies, ecstasy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And did you... I won't say, "sell"...
That shows what you see of the kitchen from the staircase.<eos> What kitchen?<eos> Exactly.<eos> What kitchen?<eos> Thank you, Dr. Katz.<eos> Your witness, Mrs. Weiss.<eos> Dr. Katz, it's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> And you. Me?<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> But I'm not famous like you are.
Dessert.<eos> The knife you described as missing from its set, do you know when it was bought?<eos> No, but I know it couldn't have been later than 2008 since that's when that model was discontinued.<eos> I bought my husband an electric drill with an array of two dozen drill bits in 2008.<eos> Admittedly, not the most romantic birthday gift, but he's a happy putterer.<eos> Well, so am I. I'd find it romantic.<eos> - My point is...<eos> - I think we already know.<eos> Dr. Katz... we've both been doing what we do for a long time, and it's put us in courtrooms for too many days.<eos> But as a result, we know the rules of the court, and one of them is you answer the questions I ask, not ones I don't.
None of them.<eos> My husband has lost them all.<eos> Then I know what you should get him for Christmas.<eos> He doesn't deserve it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now you can answer the question I haven't asked 'cause you know what it is.<eos> The missing fourth knife, it could have been lost or chewed up in the garbage disposal, or thrown out at some point in time.<eos> And this.<eos> This wound on the victim's hand, which occurred, you say, during a game none of us would want to play.<eos> But if we did, if you did, do you really think, as the blood is running down your arm and pooling on the table, you'd feel like having sex?
Fuck you, traitor.<eos> Split 'em up.<eos> I need individual statements.<eos> Where do you want the director?<eos> Put him in the interrogation room.<eos> Turn up the heat.<eos> - I want to talk to my lawyer.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Good morning, Sheriff.<eos> Mr. Mayor, you're in my chair.

Yeah, I guess it won't.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> You think I don't know that every time your girl Cruz gets an anonymous tip, we're doing your dirty work?<eos> I don't need to remind you who put you in charge here and kept you in charge, do I?<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Mayor?<eos> What progress have you made on my niece's murder investigation?<eos> We have a few leads.<eos> Yeah, I read through the files.<eos> These files are confidential.<eos> And in case you forgot, you're still a person of interest in this case.
Trust me, it can't get any fucking harder.<eos> Hey, get those last three pallets loaded.<eos> That truck should have been on the road hours ago.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Mr. Proctor, I was not expecting you today.<eos> My condolences on your loss...<eos> Don't.<eos> I'd say our terms of agreement were pretty clear.<eos> You and your Brotherhood manage my operations and I permit you to maintain yours for a bit of your profits.<eos> And that's what you've been getting.
About your niece.<eos> You should take time to mourn.<eos> Business can wait.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> A life can stop, but business must go on.<eos> My operation's been growing exponentially since we last talked.<eos> Expanding my distribution network is of high priority. - How does that benefit me?<eos> - Market dominance.<eos> It's no secret that the Sinaloa's partnership with the Chinese has hurt your bottom line.<eos> Once the cartels got into the pill industry, you could no longer control the market pricing like you did with the cocaine and the heroin.

You're a dangerous man.
Everybody is so angry.<eos> - Ma'am, you cannot be back here.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Everybody else is.<eos> - Bunker, take this woman up front, please.<eos> - Stay put, Bunker.<eos> Special Agent Veronica Dawson.<eos> Violent Crimes.<eos> Yeah, that always seems to suck the air right out of the room.<eos> I take it you're Sheriff Lotus.

Paul could have dropped him in a heartbeat.<eos> I mean, who can't outshoot a kid, right?<eos> But instead he tried to talk him down.<eos> I guess that kid didn't feel like talking.<eos> He shot Paul in the neck.<eos> Killed him instantly.<eos> - You've been doing this a while.<eos> - Long enough.<eos> Long enough to know that the fake husband story is not gonna work on someone like me.<eos> So either you think I'm an idiot or you wanted me to call you on it.
- I'm sure we'll meet again.<eos> I'm guessing you don't have a lot of pals down at the bureau.<eos> - You know a lot about the FBI, do you?<eos> But I know a little something about burnouts.<eos> Yeah, I'll bet you do.<eos> He didn't do it.<eos> You decided that in five minutes?<eos> No, I decided that in about two.<eos> - The evidence...<eos> - The evidence is shit and you know it.
Calvin!<eos> - Let's go, Calvin.<eos> - Hit it, boy!<eos> - Don't do this.<eos> I will have zero tolerance for fuckups.<eos> - What about the production delays?<eos> - Already started outfitting... I need three tons in eight days.<eos> That kind of volume usually means beaners.<eos> Attract a lot of unfriendly attention on both sides of the borders.<eos> You got one hell of a pair of balls on you, I'll give you that.

We spoke after your sister was found. I remember.<eos> I already answered all your questions.<eos> - The FBI, too. - No, I know.<eos> And I... we appreciate it.<eos> These are...<eos> Jill's personal belongings.<eos> I just want to return them to you.<eos> Look, I can only imagine how - hard this must be for you...<eos> - This guy killed three women and he was still out there free walking around to kill Jill?<eos> I mean... you're the sheriff.
Is the sheriff in?<eos> Sheriff Lotus is in a meeting. Can I help you?<eos> I have information he needs to hear.<eos> Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> He wants you to know he won't stop.
Can't... get that smell out of my head.<eos> It takes a while.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I highly doubt it.<eos> You can't go back there.<eos> - You can't go back there.<eos> - I know.<eos> That's the swelling, babe. They'll soften up...<eos> - Sweet Jesus.<eos> - Hey, hey, you can't be in here.
Exhibit number four was also turned in to our hearing officer five days before this trial began.<eos> Now, if it pleases the court, you'll note that the photograph shows the remnants of a crushed back side door.<eos> - This photograph was taken at the scene...<eos> - Mrs. Hopewell.<eos> ...of a hit-and-run five months back at the intersection...<eos> I'm seeing you around the courthouse quite often these days.<eos> Taking an interest in the law?<eos> You could say that.<eos> You know, I never really had the chance to offer my condolences for the loss of your husband.<eos> You hated Gordon.
- What happened?<eos> - They came for me.<eos> Who came for you, Carrie?<eos> You want the truth?<eos> I'm a liar.<eos> I lied to my family. I lied to my husband.<eos> Gordon, he never lied.<eos> And his truth is the only one I have left.<eos> He dedicated his whole life to fighting corruption in this town.<eos> And you feel you have to see it through because he died saving you.
And you feel you have to see it through because he died saving you.<eos> - It's not so simple. - Then help me.<eos> Help me out with it.<eos> Help me understand, Carrie.<eos> What's the truth?<eos> Carrie, help me...<eos> That I never stopped loving somebody else!<eos> - I know, I have to stop this fighting.<eos> You have to finish what you started.<eos> What kind of shrink are you?
No.<eos> You called me a... nasty little slut.<eos> I did?<eos> I do not recall that.<eos> I feel that you saw I was nervous and preyed on my insecurity.<eos> Well, wow, I... definitely didn't mean to upset you, and I sure didn't want to cause any offense.<eos> I have a sister, so I really respect women. Okay. Let me make it up to you, okay?<eos> Let me just take another picture of you.<eos> It'll be fine, it'll be...<eos> I want you to be comfortable.
Are you blaming these poor people for Joseph's murder?<eos> Doesn't his murder convince you how much these people hate what you're doing to them?<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> I've been threatening you for six months.<eos> Well, stop.<eos> Special Agent Mulder with the FBI.<eos> And who are these two fine representatives - of the City of Brotherly Love? - Hmm.<eos> Daryl Landry. I've been working with Joseph Cutler.<eos> - We've been redeveloping this area. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And you are?
No.<eos> - Oh. "Douche bag." I thought maybe...<eos> - Yeah, him and Cutler are moving these poor homeless out of this area in order to build a ten-story apartment building<eos> - The old Franklin State Hospital is in her district, just sitting there empty.<eos> We're taking these poor people out of the downtown to that facility, away from the drug bazaar, the rats, the urine in the streets.<eos> I want these people to be safe and comfortable as much as anyone.<eos> I come down here every Thanksgiving and serve turkey dinners.<eos> But?<eos> But the Franklin Hospital is just two blocks from Pennsbury High School.<eos> If one of these... downtown people killed Cutler, would you want that person moved near your children?

What I don't hear is who speaks for them.
I transitioned last year.<eos> Did you see which way it headed?<eos> I told the officers it slithered off that way, but they think I'm on crack.<eos> Are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey...<eos> Any sign of anything?<eos> Don't! Sneak up on a guy like that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, aren't you the officer who was attacked the other night?
Oh, hello again.<eos> Just looking for the ice machine. Hey.<eos> W-What the hell were you...?<eos> That's private back there.<eos> You're not supposed to be...<eos> That's a security feature.<eos> I had it put in after 9/11.<eos> I'm not gonna report you.<eos> When one checks into an establishment such as this, one expects the manager to be a Peeping Tom.<eos> But I do harbor suspicions that you saw something in that trashed room that greatly disturbed you.

Who the hell knows?<eos> In these old fairy tales, the monster must always be destroyed by some form of penetration... a silver bullet, a wooden stake... obviously, our ancestors were as obsessed with impotency as we are, eh?<eos> So, he fashions a lance of green glass and stabs the monster in its appendix.<eos> But as the monster is dying, the constable realizes he's been looking in the mirror.<eos> He was the monster all along, you see?<eos> The moral being...?<eos> It's easier to believe in monsters out there in the world than to accept that the real monsters dwell within us here... and sometimes here.<eos> Maybe sometimes here.<eos> Not everything can be reduced to psychology.<eos> That's what you think.
Did you lose somebody recently?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Myself.<eos> I know this sounds weird, but... until a few days ago, I didn't know we die.<eos> I mean, I always knew we could die,<eos> I instinctively knew to avoid death, but what I didn't know is... no matter what we do, eventually you end up in a place like this.<eos> It doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, does it?<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Nothing makes sense.<eos> I don't mean to intrude, but you seem to have something weighing heavily on you.

I just want this madness to end.<eos> But you're not thinking of doing anything crazy, are you?
But I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> The only way you can help me, mister, is... by killing me.<eos> Please.<eos> Just put me out of my misery.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Thanks, mister.<eos> You're, like, the only nice person I've ever met!
Nobody but the FBI's Most Unwanted.<eos> - I've been waiting 23 years to say that.<eos> - How'd it feel?<eos> - Pretty good. - Yeah?<eos> It's open.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Special Agent Fox Mulder? - Speaking.<eos> And to whom am I speaking?<eos> I'm Special Agent Miller. This is Special Agent Einstein.<eos> You're Special Agent Einstein?
- Pretty good. - Yeah?<eos> It's open.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Special Agent Fox Mulder? - Speaking.<eos> And to whom am I speaking?<eos> I'm Special Agent Miller. This is Special Agent Einstein.<eos> You're Special Agent Einstein?<eos> I claim a distant relation, if that's what you're referring to.<eos> For-forgive Agent Scully's impertinence. She wrote her dissertation - on Einstein's twin paradox.<eos> - Excuse me, but I was definitely told you were a medical doctor.

But I'm also a scientist.<eos> Because I'm a medical doctor. - Oh.<eos> - And you're a profiler, - obsessed with the paranormal?
Ah, come in, Agent Einstein. Have a seat.<eos> I came here in good faith, Agent Mulder, but lives are at stake.<eos> - I'm all about that.<eos> - If there were another act of terror, and I'm in here listening to some woo woo treatise on the paranormal, I don't think I could forgive myself.<eos> I-I don't do woo woo.<eos> Okay, what's your big idea?<eos> How are we going to talk with this terrorist?<eos> Well, first, can we talk about the nature of reality, as you perceive it?<eos> My reality is new chatter on the Internet - about more suicide bombs.<eos> - But do you believe that thoughts have mass?

Neo-Darwinists believe that every word spoken, every thought, every perception, lest I misperceive, is a step in the evolution of mankind.<eos> Yes.<eos> A butterfly beats its wings in China, but that butterfly won't be defusing explosives in any suicide vests.<eos> Agent Einstein, you have a terrorist lying in a state of existence somewhere between life and death.<eos> If he holds valuable intel on other terrorists, maybe in order to reach him, you need to expand your mind on the so-called material world.<eos> I got here as fast as I could.<eos> Let me say, I'm blown away you came down here<eos> - Well, I sensed your frustration.<eos> I just want to believe there's some way of reaching this young man and learning what he might know.<eos> Well, I believe there may be, but not the way you think.
Test subjects report experiences that transcended space and time, confrontations with the dead, - touching the very face of God. - That's nice,<eos> Agent Mulder... you've got about a minute and counting.<eos> Test subjects have also reported that once the impediment of the physical body is removed, deep and lasting truths are revealed that the conscious mind won't allow... feelings of ineffability, sacredness, peace, unity, joy... all without altering brain chemistry.<eos> Are you proposing, Agent Mulder, that we administer the Magic Mushroom to the terrorist?<eos> No.<eos> I am proposing that you administer it to me, so that I can communicate with the terrorist, learn what he knows, and prevent future acts of terror.<eos> To a technically dead man?<eos> Death is now viewed by some as merely another plane of existence.<eos> I don't think our terrorist has even achieved that plane. I believe he's still reachable on this plane.<eos> So you called me back here to ask me to administer this drug, this illicit Schedule 1 substance.
- Oh, let me think about that. Everything?<eos> And rest assured, Agent Mulder, when I walk out of here, I will never again darken your basement door.<eos> So that's a maybe?<eos> It's hard to imagine there's someone in there, when you really see him.<eos> Research bears out a surprising incidence of electro-activity even in the most severely brain-damaged.<eos> What I want to try is a rather... novel but not untested protocol.<eos> I'm open to whatever.<eos> I'm certain that you are, Agent Miller.<eos> I believe so many answers lie beyond the pale of the known world in realms of extreme possibility.<eos> I believe that you believe.
I'll give the orders, Agent Miller. Wrong.<eos> I'm giving the orders now.<eos> They've come here for retribution.<eos> Whoever you're calling, this goes way beyond...<eos> I'm not calling anyone.<eos> Special Agent Einstein.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't let you in there without authorization.<eos> I've been assigned this case with my partner, Special Agent Miller.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> If you're his partner, then who is Special Agent Dana Scully?
- May I ask, Agent Einstein, what changed your mind on this whole deal here?<eos> I got here to find that Agent Scully was here in Texas working with Agent Miller.<eos> I sense some professional animus.<eos> - Nothing professional about it. - But you think<eos> - this misguided.<eos> - My loss is your gain, Agent Mulder.<eos> I'll deal with Agent Miller about this later.<eos> In the meantime, we must conduct this business with a certain delicacy where the consumption of any potentially dangerous and psychotropic hallucinogen must be undertaken outside of a laboratory.<eos> You mean hide it like a couple of drug addicts.<eos> While this may seem foolhardy, I am anticipating results, that you will actually be communicating with the terrorist, somehow.
To honor their hero, Osama bin Laden, whose picture we find all too frequently on their refrigerators.<eos> Not all Muslims are extremists, certainly.<eos> Feel free to stay here and take your chances, if you don't believe me.<eos> There are other people who want to see this young man dead.<eos> I'm not one of them, Agent Miller.<eos> Last thing I want is for this... killer to die and go to paradise or to his 72 virgins in the sky.<eos> Sounds like torture to me.<eos> This boy can hear everything you're saying, and we're trying to win his trust and talk to him.<eos> Keep the killer alive.<eos> You do your job; we'll do ours.
And why is he in a sealed room?<eos> All of the children.<eos> He has a genetic disorder. He's not contagious.<eos> Thank you, Adam.<eos> We are working with therapies unavailable anywhere in the world.<eos> We need to eliminate the environmental factors that could affect the outcome.<eos> I am searching for the key that was the seed to all of these terrible genetic abnormalities.<eos> Alien DNA?<eos> Is that why the Department of Defense is funding your research?<eos> Dr. Scully, I was told that you were the rational one. No!
Passed out from loss of blood. Woke up in a hospital.<eos> I never saw my boy again.<eos> I think about him every day.<eos> A mother never forgets.<eos> All my training, everything that I know about psychology tells me that she's delusional, but, Mulder, there's something about her that I trust.<eos> She heard a tone in her head, a screech... that's what happened to me.<eos> Are you saying that you think the baby that communicated with her communicated with you?<eos> Wouldn't be a baby anymore.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You don't work for the hospital, do you? You're a subcontractor?
You heard about that.<eos> There's not a thing that goes on in my son's life that I don't know.<eos> Well, we'd still like to speak with him. He's got nothing to say.<eos> Why don't you let us decide that?<eos> I don't like to expose my son to stressful situations.<eos> It's not good for him.<eos> He doesn't understand it.<eos> He's simple. And he's a minor.<eos> And I won't allow it.<eos> You didn't give birth to Kyle. Mulder...
- No! No!<eos> - Daddy, just let me go!<eos> Get the hell away from her!<eos> Kyle!<eos> Scully!<eos> Skinner, keep your people behind the red tape.<eos> Department of Defense has control of the facility. It's now classified as top secret.<eos> We no longer have jurisdiction here.<eos> Have they found Molly or Kyle?<eos> You were the last one to see them, Agent Mulder.
Still no word from him?<eos> And he's not picking up either.<eos> You'd think he would've left a note, maybe a voice message.<eos> I'm afraid he fears my judgment.<eos> Fears your judgment on what?<eos> On whether he's crazy or not.<eos> Then you do know something.<eos> This man, Tad O'Malley, has been making claims.<eos> Claims about what?<eos> That you and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
We have the cause of death.<eos> Your wife had a fractured skull.<eos> She was probably struck with a hammer or a baseball bat, probably just once or twice, so...<eos> Your daughter had a much more difficult time.<eos> She was suffocated.<eos> She also had a broken arm.<eos> And they had both been raped.<eos> It turns out you were right about that trailer, too.<eos> How?<eos> Those fellas, they took your folks in there, just like you thought.
You know, saving things that will eventually die.<eos> And if I write it down, then, it'll last forever.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> There was traffic: on the interstate.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You look different.<eos> No beard.<eos> You look... You look different too.
What, he went back to the trailer after he left me?<eos> Yeah, looks like it.<eos> Uh, he probably just went back to tell 'em where you were.<eos> That's why they came back with the bodies.<eos> They were, they were gonna kill you.<eos> You see?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I bet your friend Ray's the third fella in the hold-up.<eos> What HOW?<eos> Well, you're gonna wait for trial.
So let me ask you a personal question.<eos> Off the record, between you and me.<eos> What do you want me to do with Ray Marcus?<eos> Well, what can you do with him?<eos> Anything you goddamn like.<eos> But I thought you said that...<eos> Listen, I got nothin' to lose.<eos> I'm not gonna let this asshole D.A. fuck up my last case. I'm also not gonna stand by and watch a murderer go free.<eos> I've seen too many sick fucks like Ray Marcus get off over the years.<eos> Now, are you willing to go outside of strict procedure on this?
Now, are you willing to go outside of strict procedure on this?<eos> Yes.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Andes here.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Ray just showed up at Line Camp.<eos> I'm gonna let that little idiot get nice and liquored up and then I'm gonna go grab his ass and take him to my camp.<eos> And I want you to come with me.
On me.<eos> "Velázquez and the Golden Age of the Spanish Military".<eos> The second part interests me.<eos> I will go with you.<eos> We'll have to get changed, right?<eos> Yes, or they'll confuse us with the figures in the paintings.<eos> "Hasta la vista, baby".<eos> -So, we have a mole in theÂ Ministry.<eos> -If there isn't one, how do you think that Mrs. Torres knew so much about us?<eos> -I thought that you informed her of everything.
Come on, it is in my DNA.<eos> DNA?<eos> Later, when we return, I will explain it to you.<eos> Why didn't you let me go with them?<eos> Because it's too soon.<eos> That's unfair and you know it.<eos> What's unfair is life, but it's all there is.<eos> It's the rules.<eos> My God. Here the rules aren't the same for everyone.<eos> You break them whenever you want.
I think that the only one I haven't caught in some transgression is Ernesto.<eos> You knew about all that?<eos> A long time ago I decided that it was your only compensation for having to sacrifice so much.<eos> You all have to save the lives of famous people, but you can't do anything to save the lives of your children or your parents.<eos> Or your wives.<eos> And that is unfair, yes.<eos> And why am I out of service now?<eos> Because there's a line that I won't permit you to cross:<eos> putting the lives of your teammates in danger.<eos> And you've crossed it more than once.
Long time, no see.<eos> No, no, we still do not have the sample.<eos> I am confident we will obtain it today.<eos> There's something eating at me, I believe he is an impostor.<eos> How did you come to that conclusion?<eos> He speaks as though he knows "The Song of my Cid" from memory.<eos> I'm calling you from 1099.<eos> Copies weren't made of the original until the 14th century.<eos> Wow.<eos> You are an encyclopedia, Miss Folch.
He is not our friend.<eos> He is a traitor, as much as it pains us.<eos> I've been away from my family for 20 years.<eos> I've given my life to the Ministry.<eos> I won't allow anyone to call me a traitor, got it?<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Some bones were found next to the Tizona and a ring.<eos> Exactly the same ring as the one you have on.<eos> I'll make sure to fix that mistake before I die.<eos> Who are you?
I know how much you've suffered.<eos> I doubt it..<eos> That's your problem, you believe you're the champion of suffering..<eos> Know what, Julián?<eos> I lost my wife, too.<eos> I wasn't as young as you, but her death left me lost.<eos> Like you, I started to go to the past to see her..<eos> And like you, I thought about saving her.<eos> After a time, they came out with medicines that could have cured her.<eos> Like Leiva wanted to do for his son and you forbid him. That's exactly why
Like Leiva wanted to do for his son and you forbid him. That's exactly why<eos> I didn't send the medicine to my wife.<eos> Don't make a grave mistake... that will give you nightmares all your life.<eos> I already made one that haunts me, don't worry.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> That's why you want to save her.<eos> But do you know the consequences we could face if you do?<eos> I don't care, Salvador, I don't care.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> If you go through again and save her, you will have never come to the Ministry.
- In my office.<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - Stop the foolishness.<eos> There is a murderer out there.<eos> - Are you sure about that?<eos> - It's the only thing I am sure about.<eos> 2016.<eos> What's up, have I travelled to the future?<eos> Yes, sure, and I am Colombo.<eos> No, you are not Colombo.
- Do you like it?<eos> - Stop the foolishness.<eos> There is a murderer out there.<eos> - Are you sure about that?<eos> - It's the only thing I am sure about.<eos> 2016.<eos> What's up, have I travelled to the future?<eos> Yes, sure, and I am Colombo.<eos> No, you are not Colombo.<eos> You are Jesús Méndez.
We have to go to that bar.<eos> Ernesto, please go with Amelia and Alonso.<eos> Am I not going?<eos> I am the only one who can identify the killer.<eos> That's why you are not going.<eos> Irene, please go to the viewing room and make sure everything is ready.<eos> If he is telling the truth we will know.<eos> Good morning<eos> Health Department<eos> - Are you the owner.
Health Department<eos> - Are you the owner.<eos> - Fuck, this is harassment, man.<eos> Yesterday that weirdo and the police and now the Health Dpt. again.<eos> - What do you mean again? - Yes<eos> Some inspectors came last week.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we are the supervisors who check on those inspectors to make sure they are doing a good job.<eos> And they say there aren't enough civil servants in this country.<eos> For now you are going to do two things;
Because this Ministry is very serious, mister.<eos> Look, that's Quincoces, a football figure.<eos> - Hello<eos> - Hello<eos> And that's Angustias, my secretary.<eos> I'll have to stay here, right?<eos> Indeed.<eos> That's the price for knowing about the Ministry, I guess.<eos> You suppose well.<eos> We can't tell the police of your time That the killer is a time traveller and that you also are.
Let's go.<eos> Did you cross the door?<eos> Yes, and now I am going to cross your face.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> - Well, I almost miss the best part.<eos> How did you know about the wardrobe?<eos> Excuse, but here we are the ones making the questions.<eos> Although I am going to propose a deal.<eos> We help you with your questions and you help us with ours.
We have found 8 bodies in the basement at your house.<eos> Are you proud of killing those women?<eos> Of leaving those children orphan?<eos> - I have always taken care of them.<eos> Making donations to an orphanage.<eos> Funny way of clearing your conscience.<eos> Do you know what it is to leave a child orphan?<eos> Alone in the world, without knowing what he is going in it?<eos> Without love?<eos> You know what you are talking about.

That's where you will go after her.<eos> Do you think I will let you follow me?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Francisco Morán, I suppose.<eos> - How do you know my name?<eos> - That doesn't matter anymore.<eos> For heaven's sake!<eos> What happened here?<eos> Pacino.<eos> Of course, when you disobey the orders, you do it big.
When saving his mother, all the events happening later, got modified.<eos> Morán died in 1915, because of tuberculosis<eos> So in 1946, Morán didn't exist anymore and he wasn't the owner of the house.<eos> When you change history, consequences can be unpredictable.<eos> And now I wonder: What would happen if we find the killer of the president and he turns out to be the great grandson of one of those poor women?<eos> But he saved Amelia.<eos> - Does that not count?<eos> - Ms. Folch wouldn't have needed to be in danger if Mr. Pacino wouldn't have tried to be the time avenger.<eos> Now everyone, please leave.<eos> Ernesto, you stay.
Antonia!<eos> We have a problem.<eos> And a big one.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, - Spain has lost "El Quijote". - Oh.<eos> But, what's wrong?<eos> What that about the "Quijote"?<eos> Bah, dude, a bit of general culture.<eos> Don't call me dude, as we are not family.<eos> Alonso doesn't know if because he lives 35 years before<eos> You, on the other hand, will have read it several times, right?
And an English mustache.<eos> - What do you mean English?<eos> - He wasn't from La Mancha, for sure.<eos> "The lord was nearly 40, the chamberlain just about 30".<eos> - Velazquez, don't miss a bit.<eos> - Yes, I will try, Sir.<eos> "...and no wrinkles in the forehead, no chip or scar".<eos> Sorry, can I have your ID?<eos> Sorry, but you are not authorized to be here.<eos> Do you know who I am?
You mean a PC.<eos> The case is that here fit movies, pictures, whole books... Whatever you want.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - I think the same.<eos> Take it to Gil Pérez so that he can check what's inside.<eos> - And you?<eos> - Tomorrow, getting up early.<eos> We have rehearsal.<eos> Let's see what's in the pen.<eos> I see that you are also an expert in computers.
It's very clear.<eos> The men from Darrow took "el Quijote" to do business with it now.<eos> Anyone would pay a fortune for something like that.<eos> I'm afraid it's not the only thing they are looking for.<eos> The pendrive was full of information about Lope de Vega.<eos> Will they also want to get any of his manuscripts?<eos> They are Americans.<eos> If they can buy anything, they will.<eos> - Maybe they haven't met with him yet.<eos> - That's why you will have to go first, Pacino.
Mother Manuela, speak to me.<eos> Pay close attention to me.<eos> We have to save those three men or the Spain that we know will cease to exist.<eos> - Are they that important?<eos> - You can't imagine how much.<eos> One of them is an sixth-generation ancestor of Adolfo Suárez,<eos> Prime Minister of Spain from 1976 until...<eos> Until January 21, 1981, the day that he resigned.<eos> I'll never forget that date as long as I live.<eos> Exactly, the day that you came through that damn wardrobe.
Is something wrong?<eos> Would you stop typing and listen to me since I'm your boss?<eos> I've said no, and no is no.<eos> A... Angustias.<eos> Angustias, what if...<eos> I give you a raise.<eos> I'll give you a Christmas Bonus.<eos> What good with money do me?<eos> It will be my goose that's cooked.<eos> Listen, have you ever heard me beg anything of anyone, ever?
You're only asking me to go see Napoleon, not Father Damian.<eos> Don't think of him as an emperor, just as a regular man.<eos> Plus, you won't be alone.<eos> And... And you speak French, right?<eos> Well, about my French... It might be that when I put "proficient" on my CV, what I meant to say was "low basic", or more like "not a clue".<eos> Fine, we'll give you an earpiece, my god.<eos> Don't insist, please.<eos> Angustias.<eos> Angustias, I'm going to be honest with you.<eos> You are my secretary, but... I consider you my friend.
All the people that were closest to him - are in paintings in the Prado.<eos> - Poor guy.<eos> Cold...<eos> Hot...<eos> Amazing.<eos> I'll go see him.<eos> I want to talk with him, take him some clothes and money.<eos> What a sweet gesture.<eos> Well, I know through experience that adapting to a new time - is a delicate situation.<eos> - You aren't from this time period?
- The French go into the towns loot everything, slitting the throats of people they find.<eos> - They don't even respect the clergy.<eos> - They are not men. They are truly beasts.<eos> We pray every day for God to protect us.<eos> Come this way.<eos> It's a trick, it's a trick.<eos> I take care of running errands, greeting visitors...<eos> - But I'm not a nun.<eos> - No?<eos> You don't know how happy that makes me.
- Tomorrow? You mean tonight, at Midnight Mass.<eos> Ah, Midnight Mass, of course.<eos> With all this traveling, I don't even know what day it is.<eos> We'll sing "Adeste fideles"<eos> And it's tradition that the mother abbess sings the solo.<eos> Bank, identification, medical card, At the market, supermarket.<eos> - Bank?<eos> - Very good.<eos> On the bus and the trains and...<eos> Very good, now you're a man of our time.
- I'm not a philosopher.<eos> - but you are green.<eos> - I'm what?<eos> You're... innocent, gullible.<eos> Look, I say it with love.<eos> Come in.<eos> Father, can I speak with you?<eos> Of course, daughter, what do you want?<eos> To confess.<eos> Are you Marshal Ney?
How could you become a nun?<eos> What will you do with the child? Put them in an orphanage?<eos> Don't even think it, everything will work out.<eos> How could he give up a woman like you?<eos> Rosa, you're bautiful and a wonderful woman.<eos> I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen Aren't you going to give me a penance?<eos> Yes, um... Three "Hail Mary's" and problem solved.<eos> Thank you very much, Father.<eos> Truely, It's a shame that you're a priest.
- In the entrance to the convent.<eos> I said that we're not going to pay and we're not going to pay.<eos> You all think you're so different with you "liberté"<eos> and your "égalité" and "fraternité" but after everything you're all the same<eos> - tyrants.<eos> - If the "empereur" weren't arriving I would send you to the firing squad with the other prisioners.<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> Marshal<eos> "Je suis désolé".<eos> "Parlaré slowly" so that you understand me.

- An escape?<eos> We've got half the French Army outside.<eos> The monestary has underground tunnels.<eos> I've been investigating.<eos> One should always plan for the worst in case the light is red.<eos> Very good.<eos> Very good, fine, let's plan it.<eos> No, we need to call the Ministry.<eos> Have we heard anything from the team?<eos> No, but usually when you say that, they call like in the movies.
Tell Father Victor that when Sister Amelia gives the signal, - he should fake a heart attack.<eos> - The other guy, he should get ready too.<eos> - Understood?<eos> - Thank you, Father.<eos> You are forgiven in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> For an unbeliever you put on a good show.<eos> See you later.<eos> I have no idea what he said.<eos> Tell him that we don't have money to pay him what he's asked.<eos> I know, you spoke Italian as a child.
- Come on.<eos> Well, now we've stuffed it with the vegetables<eos> - Mmhm. Now for the final touch:<eos> rosemary.<eos> - Rosemary?<eos> - Ah, it's my secret.<eos> It gives it such flavor and aroma, you'll see, delicious.<eos> Do you cook... "souvent"?<eos> "Souvent" no. but I can make a souffle that's to die for.<eos> No, no, I meant to say, do you cook often?
One that I had when I was young, before I took my vows.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - He was unfaithful.<eos> I know that, in his own way, he loved me but I wasn't happy.<eos> I needed a man that made me feel special, without whom my life would have no meaning.<eos> When I left him, I tried to figure out if it was my fault.<eos> Maybe I did something wrong.<eos> And searching for those answers I heard God's call.<eos> Bastard!<eos> It's his fault you are here.

- "mariés".<eos> - Since you married.<eos> We did it the day before I left for the "guerre, on Italie".<eos> - So no honeymoon or anything then.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I hardly see her now.<eos> So much "voyage", so much "guerre"...<eos> - I know that she is unfaithful now.<eos> - Of course.<eos> A marriage is something you have to tend to daily and you go from war to war and it can't work like that.
I hardly see her now.<eos> So much "voyage", so much "guerre"...<eos> - I know that she is unfaithful now.<eos> - Of course.<eos> A marriage is something you have to tend to daily and you go from war to war and it can't work like that.<eos> You should stay home more and fight less.<eos> - Your husband...<eos> - My fiancé.<eos> - Your fiancé... was an idiot.<eos> You are... delightful.
- The prisioners are here, idiot.<eos> I see that you take good care of those men.<eos> It is my obligation to give them counsel especially when they are going to die in a few hours.<eos> No, they're not going to die.<eos> Napoleon has pardoned them.<eos> God bless the Emperor.<eos> Come out, you are free.<eos> "La prochaine fois" you won't be as lucky.<eos> We're not going to die, we're not going to die.<eos> There's one thing I don't understand. You could have freed them.
Know what makes me the happiest?<eos> I didn't fail the boss.<eos> Salvador has his quirks... but he's a great man.<eos> I'm going to tell you guys something.<eos> It's silly, right?<eos> But dressed like this, I feel things.<eos> Truely?<eos> Congratulations on a successful mission.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - And you are...?
Doctor.<eos> - I want to volunteer.<eos> - Angustias...<eos> I know you're under-staffed.<eos> You could use my help.<eos> It looks like you've got a stain, Doctor.<eos> Darn, ink from my pen.<eos> - Milk works wonders on that.<eos> - Thank you. I'll go change now.<eos> - I can start right now if you want.
After working so hard I am going to die without painting "Las meninas".<eos> - Relax, you'll get better.<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> I need a canvas and brush.<eos> I have to paint them.<eos> - The Prime Minister's office called.<eos> - How did they find out?<eos> We don't know, but that's just what we need right now.<eos> I told them that everything is under control.<eos> Ah, you're very optimistic.
In a few hours it will be on it's way to Munich.<eos> The Hipocratic Oath means nothing to you.<eos> Do you realise that, because of you, millions of people could die, - like in 1918?<eos> - No, lives will be saved.<eos> We should prepare ourselves in case the virus gets out.<eos> - Who's going to spread it?<eos> - Anyone who's infected<eos> - and goes outside. - Or Schäuble could start a massive epidemic to get rich selling their vaccine.<eos> - It's possible.<eos> - I suppose you'll get a cut.

If she would have listened to me, no one would have died, and I wouldn't have done what I did.<eos> If you send me to that damn medieval castle, I'll deserve it.<eos> But no more than she does.<eos> The rules... are the rules.<eos> I knew you would say that.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> You know you'll never in your life enjoy that money.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm smiling because the guy who's detaining me is someone I like.<eos> You have ethics.
I knew you would say that.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> You know you'll never in your life enjoy that money.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm smiling because the guy who's detaining me is someone I like.<eos> You have ethics.<eos> Not like some others.<eos> If it were someone else, I would already be on a plane, far from here.<eos> I'd bribe them and problem solved.<eos> You are incorruptable.
Yes, I know I keep saying it, but I don't care.<eos> Ok.<eos> You need to take care of yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Sure you just want water?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yes, yes, you know I don't drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I see that not even an extreme situation can change you.<eos> Instead of that suit, you should wear a superhero's cape.
- If you don't let me leave,<eos> - I'll make a scene.<eos> - You won't do anything.<eos> Ah, no?<eos> And why not?<eos> - This must be very hard for you.<eos> - That doesn't matter now, Ernesto.<eos> We have to intervene.<eos> Damn.<eos> And now it seems you need my help.
Your team mate is referring to something else with the used car salesman.<eos> Of course, with his dermo-optical perception there's no case he can't solve.<eos> - His "dermo-" what?<eos> - He can see inside bodies.<eos> Yes, of course, and he can take x-rays.<eos> Man, please, it's a trick.<eos> Only God can do that.<eos> Fine, they haven't called us to find out if its a trick or not.<eos> The Ministry in 1924 sent us this video because they suspect that Argamasilla could be planning something shady having to do with this man.<eos> Do you manage the man with the x-ray eyes?
I'm sorry, but I was expecting someone else,<eos> - a Melitón Pérez.<eos> - That's me.<eos> I use a masculine pseudonym, you know how it is.<eos> Well we're just missing one guest, a new clairvoyent.<eos> - We'll have to start without him.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> Excuse the delay.<eos> If I could only divine when it will rain in this city.<eos> You are...
What are you doing?<eos> Let him.<eos> He's the Great Benito.<eos> - No.<eos> - Benito?<eos> Where did he come from?<eos> No.<eos> The girls are not in Moncloa, or El Pardo, as you've told their parents.<eos> No.<eos> You lied to the police.
In the garbage dump... on Cea Bermúdez street.<eos> - We have to go there.<eos> - We must go there and confirm it.<eos> I will take charge myself.<eos> I'll call the Police chief.<eos> The Valle coronel is a good friend.<eos> Do not leave here, either of you.<eos> I'm warning you, young man.<eos> If this is just a bad joke I will see you thrown in jail myself.<eos> But if he's telling the truth, it will be you going to jail.
I'm leaving for New York in a few days with my new friends.<eos> I'm searching for... other countries, other worlds, people... who are more spiritually open.<eos> I couldn't have said it better.<eos> And we will do an article on your trip.<eos> What a shame we didn't know that before.<eos> You could have traveled with my son.<eos> I don't like him to travel alone.<eos> But my son has insisted this time.<eos> Please, I'm a grown man already, father.<eos> Are you traveling to New York also?
And if you don't mind, I'd rather go alone.<eos> - Buisness talk, you know.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Joaquín<eos> - Yes?<eos> I would like to ask you a question.<eos> - Is it important?<eos> Like I said...<eos> Go on.<eos> Supposedly you can see through objects.
Go on.<eos> Supposedly you can see through objects.<eos> - Right?<eos> - That's what they say, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Could you tell me what Amelia is doing behind that wall?<eos> Benito my friend having powers doesn't mean you stop being a gentleman.<eos> - Joaquín.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You are a role model.
It's not easy to get a drink in this city.<eos> An honor, Great Benito.<eos> I am...<eos> Although I don't need to introduce myself.<eos> By just touching my head you'll know who I am.<eos> Show him what you're worth, Benito.<eos> It's just that it comes and goes, you know?<eos> Benito...<eos> Fine.<eos> You are Gromek
- No, that's not the secret.<eos> Well then, what is?<eos> Fine, if you don't want to tell me, it's cool, yeah?<eos> I'm not going to tell you.<eos> Why would I waste my breath if you can find out by touching my head?<eos> May I?<eos> Please, go ahead.<eos> You can travel in time?<eos> Spain... Spain has a ministry where they travel throughout history?<eos> You are amazing.
When he wakes up, we'll find out, yeah?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - We're agents from the 2016 Ministry of Time.<eos> You have a very pretty freckle on your left breast.<eos> It doesn't matter if you cover yourself.<eos> And you, a scar on your right side.<eos> A stab wound?<eos> By the way, you've been blessed.<eos> Don't try to impress them with your powers.<eos> You're a fantastic actor, you know that?
No, that doesn't sound very convincing.<eos> We can do this all afternoon, but your sarcasm won't make me feel any worse than I already do.<eos> Please, let me remind you that we have an active mission and that I urgently need to use the bathroom.<eos> Could we leave the personal stuff until later?<eos> Ernesto, always so pragmatic.<eos> The problem is that we don't have any proof of what you're telling me. Our only witness is Lola, a fugitive from our own jail.<eos> With your help, Irene, by the way.<eos> I'll accept responsibility for whatever you want.<eos> With regards to proof, it won't be the first time that we take action without having it.<eos> You know we always find it along the way.
And you're very good in bed.<eos> But you have one defect, Susana.<eos> You're a traitor.<eos> How could you do buinsess with Darrow?<eos> You don't understand, Irene.<eos> Darrow is not our enemy.<eos> They're an ally, a capitalist partner to help us move forward.<eos> The Ministry will be the first great enterprise in this country - with foreign capital.<eos> - And of course, you get your commissions.<eos> You're an idealist, Ernesto.
Come on... Shit.<eos> We have visitors, boss.<eos> Welcome back to the old Ministry.<eos> As you can see, the family is together again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> As I was saying yesterday... you must travel to 1971 to Bélmez de la Moraleda, Jaén providence.<eos> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to stop the faces of Bélmez from disappearing forever.<eos> Fantastic, well, good luck in Bélmez.<eos> - Can I go now? - No.<eos> You stay.
With your permission, captain, I say that we lock him up and leave him 2 days with only water.<eos> I think this is for you.<eos> This morning I had a missed call on my Ministry phone.<eos> Alonso called from the police station.<eos> They detained him in an anti-eviction demonstration.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Just getting back from a mission?<eos> How far down did you read, Angustias?<eos> Well, only to the part where you have a secret son.
Her lifestyle.<eos> A subsecretary's salary isn't enough for all that.<eos> This must be hard for you.<eos> I don't understand at all. Houdini congratulatedme and want to keep working with me.<eos> We have no escape.<eos> We have one.<eos> Houdini.<eos> And how do you plan to convince him?<eos> By offering him what he wants most in this world.<eos> Looks like you need my help now.
Alonso, son, I see your struggle with euphanisms hasn't improved.<eos> I'm talking about going over what's been done up until now<eos> - and correcting any possible errors.<eos> - You mean, paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.<eos> - Nothing but excitement and adventure.<eos> - Don't get too disappointed just yet.<eos> As the team leader, Amelia will be in charge of reports.<eos> You two will make note of newly appeared doors, catalog them, traveling through and taking note of place and time.<eos> It's not fair that they get to travel while I do paperwork.<eos> But you are the ideal person for that kind of work.
Is something wrong?<eos> I think that this is for you.<eos> Then it would be best if I see it.<eos> "My dearest Ernesto: How are you?<eos> I hope that everything is going as well as possible.<eos> You might be surprised that I'm writing you after so much time, but there's something that I have to tell you.<eos> In fact, it's something that I should have told you a long time ago.<eos> I hope that someday you can forgive me, although I doubt you will when you find out... that you have a son and that I haven't been able to tell you about him all this time."<eos> How far did you read, Angustias?<eos> Well, only up to the part about you having a secret son.
In the Arroceros Military Hospital, but they're transferring me to Cañacao, by the bay.<eos> - What he's saying makes sense.<eos> - That doesn't mean anything.<eos> He would have a story prepared.<eos> Just because he's a spy doesn't mean he's an idiot.<eos> Listen, I don't want to cause any problems.<eos> I'll just do what I came to do and tomorrow I'll leave, first thing.<eos> A medic could be useful to us, even if it's only for a few hours.<eos> Your men could use a check-up.<eos> Why don't you do it yourself, Doctor?
- Baler, Phillipines.<eos> - Are you fucking...<eos> We should demand that those natives respect the law and put down their arms.<eos> It's been three months since we've heard from Manila.<eos> You mean that after 400 years... you're feeling little butterflies of love, yeah?<eos> Do not be ridiculous.<eos> You're killing men that have dediacate their lives to their country in exchange for nothing.<eos> The motherland gives honor and glory... to those who fight under her flag.<eos> In this Ministry we only demand one thing: discretion.<eos> And you decided to get in a fight with the police at a demonstration.
A toast to the retiree, of course.<eos> To the best police officer ever to walk the streets of Madrid, my father.<eos> I want to divorce your father.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Hello, handsome.<eos> Is your mother in?<eos> - You've requested two days off?<eos> - Yeah. My dad's retiring and... it's going to be tough on him.<eos> I want to be with him.<eos> You are completely insane.
What the hell are these guys doing here?<eos> - Where Supergirl goes, we go.<eos> - This is a top secret facility, Mr. Olsen.<eos> You think I'm gonna let the media waltz through here?<eos> Actually, I'm in IT.<eos> So, definitely not worth, uh, shooting.<eos> If something happens to her, I'm coming back for you.<eos> If anything happens to her, I won't stop you.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> You are clearly in need of a refresher course on base security protocol.

They're Kara's family.
I can tell you how to help her.<eos> But you have to trust me.<eos> The last time I trusted you, six soldiers died.<eos> I knew there was more to you and my niece.<eos> She's my sister.<eos> If she is your sister and I am her aunt, what does that make us?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Do not allow your hatred for me blind you now.<eos> Are you ready to listen? Or not.<eos> Okay, so... So you were her?
I mean, that's gonna be slightly traumatic.<eos> Agent Danvers has considered it, which is why she came here.<eos> Kara is gonna need James and Winn by her side when she wakes up.<eos> - I know there are security issues... - Take them.<eos> Take them.<eos> I thought I was gonna have to argue that point a lot harder.<eos> I'm beginning to see why she values them so much.<eos> I'll see you back at the DEO, after I deal with Cat.<eos> Miss Grant... If I may?<eos> It's clear I've caused you significant emotional distress and I want you to know that pains me a great deal.
And by "you people," I don't mean homosexuals. I mean white men over 50.<eos> So can I just please have the wallet?<eos> Of course.<eos> Please come... come in.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Um, yes, if you could m-maybe say hi to your father from me?<eos> Um, and let him know that I got his name off his ID and I...<eos> I friended him on Facebook and that he can connect with me there if he wants.<eos> Okay, you seem like... you seem like a really nice man, Keith.
The DMV is actually very nice now.<eos> I don't understand that you don't know this.<eos> Well, I don't know the Internet that well.<eos> Look at that, 4:45, you have one last appointment today.<eos> You can still make it, look.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What are you... (scissors snipping)<eos> Look, look at this.<eos> You're a miracle worker.
Okay.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, sir.<eos> I know that this is ridiculous, but we would like to hire you to drive us in your taxi.<eos> To a few destinations.<eos> I couldn't be more off-duty.<eos> Work is the worst, right?<eos> I get that, but listen, we would not be asking if it was not an emergency.<eos> Please, we're over on our way to a really important trip, and I'm such a moron,<eos> I forgot my passport, so, I'm in trouble with the wife, you can understand.
I guess all I did my entire life was trying to escape from that place.<eos> My characters were never able to leave. I was never able to come back.<eos> Are you planning to go? No!<eos> No way!<eos> Let's go on.<eos> I've received a lot of emails and calls from your publisher.<eos> Vicente.<eos> What does he say?<eos> The usual.<eos> He beats around the bush, but he discreetly wants to know whether you're writing.
A hundred kilometers, I guess.<eos> - What are you planning to do?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> When they see we're not there, they'll come for us.<eos> Right.<eos> That's if they look for us in this shortcut no one knows about.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Here.<eos> Maybe you can start it with paper.<eos> Did you write that book?
And that's exactly why I haven't written for almost five years.<eos> Are there any questions?<eos> Yes?<eos> Is it true that unhappiness is the best state for artistic creation?<eos> No, no. I don't think pain can guarantee great artistic creation. No.<eos> I mean, Rimbaud and van Gogh had tortuous lives, and yet they were incredibly creative, but I could mention magnificent artists who had quiet and peaceful lives.<eos> For example, Jorge Luis Borges.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> I read an article in which you said the opposite.<eos> You said something like: "The most prosperous countries have a less interesting artistic production."
You see people like that everywhere.<eos> In New York, in Amsterdam, in Berlin...<eos> Dr. Florencio Romero, president of SVAA.<eos> SVAA, what's that?<eos> Salas Visual Arts Association.<eos> - That's great. Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is it true that according to you my painting is not good enough?<eos> I see it's among the rejected ones and maybe it was a mistake or something...<eos> Let me get this straight. You're taking part in the contest, and at the same time you want to give your opinion about what we choose?

And that's what you're trying to impose here, along with your literature, which is plagued by resentment and hate towards your own town, your origins.

- Okay...<eos> - And that's not all.<eos> There's plenty more!<eos> You are a rat! You ran away when things got tricky!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> And now you come here to lecture!<eos> You found the perfect formula!<eos> You denigrate your hometown and get paid back in Euros for it!<eos> You kiss Europeans ass!
But why don't you write about nice things?<eos> ...to conquer the trust and affection oi the victim...<eos> This guy is a traitor.<eos> Long live our country, Daniel!<eos> I married Irene.<eos> You left and I kept your girlfriend.<eos> More rural and rustic stories for your European readers.<eos> We're at! from Salas, sir.<eos> I'm very proud that my dad is in one of your books.<eos> In a way, you've made him immortal.
This story begins with a letter.<eos> a letter printed in paper sent from my home town.<eos> 1 guess ah I did my entire fife was trying to escape from that place.<eos> My characters were never able to leave and I was never able to come back."<eos> Last two questions?<eos> Over there.<eos> I'm Alex Bussard from Channel Plus.<eos> First, I want to congratulate you for your novel.<eos> And my question is:<eos> Although "The Distinguished Citizen" takes place in Salas like your previous novels, what's new now is that you're the protagonist.
Lee not appearing immodest.<eos> Our most skilled guests will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park, besting fearsome braves, seducing nubile maidens, befriending tragically ill-fated sidekicks, and, of course, like all our best narratives over the years,<eos> our guests will have the privilege of getting to know the character they're most interested in...<eos> Themselves.<eos> I present our guests' next obsession:<eos> Odyssey on Red River.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Wait, you don't think...
The titillation, horror, elation... They're parlor tricks.<eos> The guests don't return for the obvious things we do, the garish things.<eos> They come back because of the subtleties, the details.<eos> They come back because they discover something they imagine no on had ever noticed before... something they've fallen in love with.<eos> They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are.<eos> They already know who they are.<eos> They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.<eos> Billy!<eos> Let's go.<eos> The only thing your story tells me, Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.
- Just us.<eos> I served a warrant for the GPS data.<eos> Waiting for the Bentley dealer to get back to us with that.<eos> Could take some time.<eos> Or we could just ask the Feds.<eos> You think they'd tell us?<eos> - If we say please. - Ah.<eos> Now, frankly, Mayor Ramos has had his turn.<eos> We need a new approach to our problems. We need a fresh take.<eos> We... Now, Mr. District Attorney, speculation is rampant that you're running for mayor.
Hey, you want a room?<eos> I'm happy to comp you.<eos> LAPD is picking up the tab.<eos> This would be an upgrade, trust me.<eos> I'm also gonna need to take a look at the eye in the sky footage from last week.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You gonna make me get a warrant for that, too?<eos> If it were up to me...<eos> I know.<eos> You don't make the rules.
That woman you brought in, Eleanor Wish, she's got nothin' to do with this case.<eos> Let me call you back.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> I interviewed her yesterday about Allen.<eos> You interviewed. She didn't even know his last name.<eos> Iverson, get a cup of coffee.<eos> I want her kicked loose.<eos> Because she's your ex-wife?<eos> No, because she's got nothin' to do with this.<eos> Any of it. Well, you don't get to decide that.
He puts money on the streets for Marks. He makes sure he gets paid back.<eos> What's he got to do with Eleanor?<eos> She's been seen with him over the years.<eos> Enough contact to open a file on her.<eos> So how do we fix this?<eos> Make us part of the case.<eos> Beginning to end.<eos> If Rykoff did this, he did it for Marks.<eos> You're using my ex wife to leverage me to get to Joey Marks.<eos> What, you get the glory, we get the paperwork while you ride off into the sunset with a guy we've been chasing for years?
Sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.<eos> Employees and customers.<eos> Anyone not in your pocket?<eos> This isn't a courtroom, Mr. Marks. What do you want?<eos> I want you to enjoy yourself, Detective.<eos> Stay another night.<eos> Nice hotel, nice girl.<eos> Maybe you'll get lucky at the tables.<eos> You like Blackjack?<eos> And what do you get?
- Told you, Bosch.<eos> You had the wrong guy.<eos> You planted a gun on the wrong man, detective.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - You planted a gun on the wrong man.<eos> - He's our undercover agent.<eos> - Task force.<eos> You compromised him and our whole operation.<eos> I did not plant the gun.<eos> If you didn't, who did?
If you didn't, who did?<eos> I don't fuckin' know who did.<eos> And I don't give a shit if he's a federal agent.<eos> We found the murder weapon in his house.<eos> We have his prints on our victim.<eos> And you gave us his travel records, which put him in L.A. the night of.<eos> Fuckin' records are phony.<eos> We needed to get him back here in one piece after you fucked up our operation.<eos> - Let's everybody just calm down.<eos> - Who the hell are you?
I want you to work the case.<eos> With RHD? With me.<eos> I need you, Bosch.<eos> I need a detective who will be relentless on behalf of my son.<eos> - Look, sir...<eos> - Arceneaux.<eos> And right now he's untouchable.<eos> And he knows who's behind this.<eos> And RHD can't even talk to him.<eos> But you can.
You're busy concocting a fantasy, detective.<eos> It never happened.<eos> What a grim workplace you inhabit.<eos> Does it ever get you down?<eos> I kind of like it.<eos> It inspires me.<eos> I bet it does.<eos> If you think this is grim, imagine what prison is like.<eos> If Carl Nash killed my husband, he deserves to rot in one for the rest of his life.<eos> Where do you think Layla is?
Where do you think Layla is?<eos> Don't know, don't care.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> She's got the money, right?<eos> Your money.<eos> You and your stories, detective.<eos> She got to that safe deposit box the day after your husband's body was found.<eos> The box was in her name, too.<eos> She didn't have to wait for probate.<eos> What do you think's in that backpack?
Told them there were laundered funds in those accounts.<eos> She can't touch them.<eos> So, speaking of the merry widow?<eos> Can't go to the DA with what we've got.<eos> As of now, she walks.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> Let's take this one.<eos> Mrs. Allen, I'm Martin Weiss.<eos> We met a couple of years ago At Freddie Macnekian's funeral.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are.
We met a couple of years ago At Freddie Macnekian's funeral.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> Ed, what is this?<eos> Mr. Weiss has a proposal for you.<eos> The man who had my son murdered was in our sights, and now he's gone.<eos> He'll turn up.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> I swore I'd look him in the eye.<eos> Might not work out that way.<eos> You and Edgar will now be part of RHD's overarching investigations.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> It's almost impossible to recover bearer bonds if they're lost or stolen.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I know that. I also know that bearer bonds are used for money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit business transactions.<eos> You're very well informed. Hmm.<eos> My husband was a money launderer.<eos> He told me he was a producer of adult entertainment.<eos> Please.<eos> Let's cut the crap, Mr. Morada.<eos> You knew the real source of my husband's income. You helped him wash it.

That's a shit job.<eos> Yep.<eos> They're mad at you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I think Connor suspects we were running a parallel investigation.<eos> Maybe he blames us for spooking Nash, setting this whole thing in motion.<eos> It has crossed my mind.<eos> Yeah, mine, too.<eos> We were so close to grabbing him up.<eos> So what do you think happened? Why did Nash spook?
Where'd you send them?<eos> Thurmond Bradley Investments on Wilshire.<eos> They're not so picky about who's in their waiting room.<eos> - Did you catch a name?<eos> - Sorry. I don't remember.<eos> What about the church?<eos> I don't think he ever said.<eos> Your namesake, she relieved our Lord's suffering on his Via Dolorosa.<eos> I'm afraid I was named for the Veronica in the comic books.<eos> You look more like Betty to me.
How long?<eos> Celebrated our 60th anniversary last year.<eos> The first Armenian Catholic church in California.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's perfect.<eos> We'll look at the calendar. May and June book up first.<eos> Mrs. Sarkisian.<eos> Forgive me, Mrs. Allen, but why our church?<eos> You don't look Armenian, and your name...
He inherits a whole big steaming bowl of shit.<eos> Bosch, line 1.<eos> Bosch.<eos> I've been trying to get hold of you.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I've been calling and calling.<eos> Ma'am, your name.<eos> Annette McKay.<eos> You're the woman that's been talking to Keisha Russell.<eos> You won't return my calls.
And how many times did you hit him?<eos> Once or twice I don't...<eos> I don't really remember.<eos> I was terrified. I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> - You feared for your life.<eos> So is that enough?<eos> I can work with this.<eos> We'll dig deep into Father Tabakian, find out all about him, all his secrets.<eos> Right now, he's the victim.<eos> By the time we get to trial, you will be.
Put him in the relocation program.<eos> There may have been other victims as well, besides my mother.<eos> Informants have always necessitated looking away at times... the greater good rationalizations.<eos> But if he did something like that, I was certainly unaware of it.<eos> Somebody was, but he was too important to their investigation to take a fall for a few murdered prostitutes.<eos> He got a free pass.<eos> Hard to believe.<eos> You know, a week ago, you told me the murderer of a cop. Your son was about to be swept under the rug.<eos> You didn't find that hard to believe.<eos> I don't have access to relocation files, but you do.

Oh, she's there. Put her on.<eos> Really?<eos> You can speak with her?<eos> How?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, Jess, I-I need to talk to you now.<eos> Um, okay. I got to go.<eos> Jess says hi!<eos> Do you prefer the windows down or the AC?<eos> Wow, you look just like Cece!
If you know Coach, that's exactly how he...<eos> - "Wedding." - Yeah, yeah.<eos> And then he always goes, "Coach."<eos> Now, me, myself, I am Winston Bishop.<eos> Officer Winston Bishop?<eos> The Winston Bishop?<eos> The Carport Hero?<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> I saw you on TV, man.<eos> Officer, you make me want to be a better man.
No, no, no.<eos> Look, Schmidt.<eos> Mom. I'm sorry.<eos> I can explain everything.<eos> Presenting... Cece's mom!<eos> - Except for that.<eos> - I'm her mom.<eos> - You're her mom?<eos> - That's my mom.<eos> - Then who are you? !
If he finds out that you're talking to board members, he's going to shit his bespoke pant...<eos> Oh, it's the Kaan and Associates Dream Team.<eos> Hey, Teddy, how you doing?<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Very good.<eos> Figuring out a way for Jeannie to make us even more money?<eos> That is exactly what we were doing when you walked in.<eos> And if I may say, sir, we are crushing it.<eos> Absolutely crushing it, so...<eos> I don't know who you are.
Listen to me.<eos> What kind of car do you drive?<eos> It's my black Mercedes SUV.<eos> That car has a GPS.<eos> The tracking number is 3422347.<eos> - Well, how do you know that number?<eos> - I just remember.<eos> Please, they're very dangerous.<eos> You have to catch them.<eos> You know what? It took a lot of balls to escape like you did.
So, maybe this is ending for you, but... It's not over for me.<eos> That's all I wanted to say.<eos> I'm not gonna get into a debate with you, Ms. Diaz.<eos> But if you believe you share no responsibility in the events that brought you to this courtroom, you are mistaken.<eos> Some children are not so fortunate as yours, some children whose cases pass before this court never make it.<eos> And those of us who work here and work very conscientiously and very hard, i might add, are haunted by the fact every single day we step foot in this room. And I will always go to err on the side prudence and time because at the end of the day, it is a far lesser price to pay than that of a young life.<eos> I can sympathize with what you've been through and it might be good of you to understand our position as well.<eos> Well, maybe so, but your position is always gonna be sitting up there, looking down at all of us, people you know nothing about.<eos> If you have a problem with me sitting up here, you can take it up with the mayor's office before they reappoint me.<eos> And I don't presume to know you beyond the confines of this courtroom, but I can assure you, you don't know anything about us either.

-You're good?<eos> Happy holidays, Ms. Fisher.<eos> Mr. denholz, you cleaned up for the occasion. Yes, I bought this suit about a week ago.<eos> I got a wedding to attend and thought I'd give the collar's threads a rest.<eos> Understood.<eos> Ms. Fisher, let me put my cards out on the table, okay?<eos> Do I have a shot at a date with you?<eos> No.<eos> Let me leave you with this thought.<eos> I am smart as anyone you're ever gonna date, and i-- and I have a good heart, and I know at least two women that think I'm an excellent kisser.
Let's see, I see here that you would like to go back on birth control?
We miss you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, look at her.<eos> [sobbing] She's getting so big.<eos> [laughs softly] [sobbing] Don't.<eos> You're getting so big!<eos> [sighs] [sniffles] - [laughs] [knocking]<eos> Some night, huh?<eos> Oh, hey. [laughs]<eos> What are you doing here?
Did... did you just say "Gob"?<eos> Did you say "Gob"?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, she said "Gob."<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> Justice.<eos> This question is for potential juror number 16.<eos> This case involves marriage.<eos> I don't believe in marriage.<eos> Excuse me, you don't believe in marriage?
Well, you know, you gotta keep the freeway open.<eos> Uh, 'cause... sooner or later, you're gonna get tired of the same cars driving down it.<eos> Capiche?<eos> Yes, capiche.<eos> The two things that are ruining this country are marriage and democracy.<eos> How refreshing.<eos> Another person who wants to get out of jury duty.<eos> I thought some people took this seriously, but apparently not.<eos> Trial by jury is a pillar of our democracy, and yes, it is inconvenient. But sometimes, sacrifice and civic duty are.<eos> You don't deserve the honor of serving your country.
We can start betting on games then too.<eos> We still got to get a job.<eos> I went to Amherst on the G.I. Bill, and I've taught all over.<eos> I like seeing a bit of the country I fought for.<eos> Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas?<eos> I didn't really take to the city.<eos> Well, it is a shithole, all right.<eos> When I saw your ad, I realized I was more of a small-town guy.<eos> Discipline.<eos> You got some?

Uh... definitely.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> She was a part of some study in college.<eos> -MK Ultra?<eos> -Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Was, uh, started in the '50s.<eos> By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.<eos> Messed her up good.<eos> This was the CIA that ran this?<eos> You and Terry would've gotten along.
Papa!<eos> Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies.<eos> You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism.<eos> You know, to deal with the guilt.<eos> Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth?<eos> About having had the kid.<eos> There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital.<eos> Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.<eos> Yeah, but that could've been covered up. Right?<eos> Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
This... thing that took your son... we don't really understand it.<eos> But its behavior is predictable.<eos> Like all animals... it eats.<eos> It will take more sons.<eos> More daughters.<eos> I want to save them.<eos> I want to save your son.<eos> But I can't do that. Not without your help.<eos> Stop.<eos> I know who you are.
He was already ill!<eos> He was an addict!<eos> But it made him worse.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Greenfern looked after him.<eos> That was the name of the company... .. but they didn't allow him to leave India for a while, and when he did come home he couldn't look after himself.<eos> He moved back in to live with me.<eos> You've tried to look after him.<eos> I HAVE looked after him!<eos> Whatever you think, whatever you're saying, you're wrong.
I was going to ask him that.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Why did you go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was an impulse.<eos> - That's another lie!<eos> - You knew Laura for one week.<eos> You don't see her in six years and now, suddenly, you're at her funeral.<eos> That... doesn't make any sense.<eos> Unless you had another agenda.
No!<eos> Then why'd you tell us his name?<eos> Look, I don't know what you're talking about... you asked me questions, I gave you answers.<eos> He did that VERY well, didn't he?<eos> I thought so.<eos> Look, I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> This has got nothing to do with me.<eos> - And now he's getting nervous.<eos> - Look, Bruce...<eos> You, Mark Henson, Laura Jones, Steve Mullen and Henry Williams all took part in a drugs test and something went wrong.
This has got nothing to do with me.<eos> - And now he's getting nervous.<eos> - Look, Bruce...<eos> You, Mark Henson, Laura Jones, Steve Mullen and Henry Williams all took part in a drugs test and something went wrong.<eos> Now three of those people are dead.<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> - You could be next.<eos> - It's got nothing to do with me.<eos> It's got everything to do with you.<eos> You know the truth.

But you were bad cop too!<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Yeah, we got what we wanted!<eos> He's scared.<eos> He'll come back to us.<eos> Now...<eos> I want you to do the same thing to David Leese.<eos> Why?<eos> I helped you, you help me.<eos> You were here before.
I want you to do the same thing to David Leese.<eos> Why?<eos> I helped you, you help me.<eos> You were here before.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where's your senior officer?<eos> He sent me.<eos> Why?<eos> Further information has come to light, sir.<eos> You told us that you'd never heard of Henry Williams, who's now the chief suspect in a murder enquiry.

What sort of complaint?<eos> I'm afraid to say, it's not very pleasant, sir.<eos> It's of a sexual nature.<eos> Who?<eos> His name's Stefan Kowolski.<eos> The complaint's against you.<eos> What?<eos> That's... that's outrageous.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You deny that you touched him in an inappropriate way in this office?

I suppose you're trying to find out why I followed him.<eos> You did stay in touch with him.<eos> By that, if you mean that there was occasionally reason for me to call him on professional matters, then, yes.<eos> What about the office Christmas party?<eos> - What party?<eos> - Nat King Cole roasting chestnuts. Too much eggnog, you get a little sloppy, you wind up knocking boots with the boss. - Happens all the time.<eos> - Absolutely not. Not to me. - No?<eos> - No, Charles.<eos> I don't know what the hell goes on at Cambridge, but I do not get sloppy.<eos> That is not who I am. And for you to imply that it might be means that you are grossly mistaken about me personally and more importantly tells me that you need to learn the damn truth about sexual harassment.
Finally, he made a comment that I will vividly remember.<eos> He said that if I ever told anyone of his behavior, that it would ruin his career.<eos> I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas.<eos> I seek only to provide the committee with information which it may regard as relevant.<eos> It would have been more comfortable to remain silent.<eos> I took no initiative to inform anyone.<eos> But when I was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience,<eos> I could not keep silent.<eos> There's no way he survives this day.<eos> Professor, before I begin my questioning, I notice that you have a number of people here.
To an individual who had a very large penis and used the name that he was referred to in the pornographic material.<eos> Do you recall what that was?<eos> I do.<eos> The name that was referred to was Long Dong Silver.<eos> Jesus Christ Almighty.<eos> Can you tell the committee here what was the most embarrassing of all these alleged incidents?<eos> I think the one that was the most embarrassing was his descriptions of pornography involving women with large breasts engaged in a variety of sex with different people or animals.<eos> That was the thing that embarrassed me the most and made me feel the most humiliated.<eos> Professor, I'm going to yield the floor now to my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.<eos> Professor Hill, you testified that you drew an inference that Judge Thomas might want you to look at pornographic films, but you told the FBI specifically that he never asked you to watch the films.
But when you testified, as I wrote it down,<eos> "We ought to look at pornographic movies together,"<eos> that was an expression of what was in your mind.<eos> That was the inference that I drew, yes.<eos> What with his pressing me for social engagements, yes.<eos> But the fact is flatly he never asked you to look at pornographic movies with him?<eos> With him?<eos> - No, he did not.<eos> - No, he did not.<eos> Professor Hill, you said you took it to mean Judge Thomas wanted to have sex with you, but in fact, he never did ask you to have sex, correct?
How would any member on this committee, any person in this room, any person in this country like sleaze said about him or her in this fashion?<eos> Or this dirt dredged up and these lies displayed in this manner?<eos> This is a circus.<eos> It's a national disgrace.<eos> And from my standpoint... as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it's a hi-tech lynching... for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves... do for themselves... to have different ideas.<eos> And it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order... this is what will happen to you.<eos> You will be lynched, destroyed... caricatured... by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.<eos> Judge, tomorrow we will reconvene.<eos> I assume, Judge... it's your choice...<eos> I assume you wish to come back tomorrow.
- What the hell is he doing?<eos> - No, Senator.<eos> You said you never did say,<eos> "Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?"<eos> You never did talk about Long Dong Silver.<eos> I submit those things were found... from page 70 of this particular version of "The Exorcist."<eos> "'Dennings had remarked to him in passing, ' said Sharon, 'that there appeared to be, quote, an alien pubic hair floating around in my gin, unquote.'"<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You think that was spoken by happenstance?<eos> I think it is very well that you were not here to hear the testimony of Ms. Hill...
All right. Thanks, guys.<eos> You're proud about small-time convictions<eos> - Hey, hey. That's enough.<eos> ...uneducated minorities with limited options.<eos> - What about the hundreds of millions... billions... in fraudulent gains in the financial sector?<eos> Why aren't you prosecuting the investment banks and hedge funds for insider trading?<eos> You're bragging about netting minnows, but you won't touch a firm like Axe Capital.<eos> My office is soft on financial crime.<eos> Go ask the 81 convicted felons of financial crimes currently serving time.<eos> But you have a very specific conflict of interest right in your own home.
Once?<eos> You're an altar boy.<eos> That was every Halloween for me.<eos> You're from around here, right?<eos> Yeah, Grand Concourse.<eos> Then White Plains. Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, Yonkers, but it wasn't nice back then.<eos> Hey, man, Yonkers used to be a place where you could really get your ass kicked.<eos> You're a good kid for a fucking hack.<eos> And you're a good guy for a bankster.
I know.<eos> You deserved it. No, I didn't.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You live in the city? Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... Michael amended his will two months ago.<eos> I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.<eos> I'm sure this is very hard for them.<eos> $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.<eos> Are you Chelsea Rayne?
David didn't say.<eos> He must have said something. He must have given a reason why.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> He doesn't have to.<eos> He just said he wants a new intern.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> Michael amended his will two months ago.<eos> I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.<eos> $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.<eos> Are you Chelsea Rayne?

I like sex.<eos> I was role-playing.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> So you knew you were being recorded?<eos> Yes.<eos> Again, it was a private moment with a person that I cared about.<eos> The tape was for us, not for the public.<eos> Why did your ex release it?<eos> I don't know who released it.<eos> Well, his voice is distorted on the tape, and you said you broke up with him a month earlier.
Thanks for asking, how's yours?<eos> Kids aren't in jail yet, so it's a good week.<eos> You need anything?<eos> Water, coffee?<eos> - No, I'm good. - All right.<eos> And thanks for making the time.<eos> - I really appreciate it.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - Well, people talk.<eos> But we know that you're a good lawyer and uh...
He can go to an Ivy League college.<eos> -But we really need to start now.<eos> -Ivy League?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who's gonna pay?<eos> You?<eos> That kid spends enough time in the clouds, okay?<eos> It's hard as it is to keep him here in the real world.<eos> This is not helping.<eos> Ezekiel knows a whole lot more about the real world than you think.
When the lights went out, I was in the movies, and it suddenly blacked out.<eos> At 9:34 pm, a complete power shutdown occurred.<eos> Any idea when the power will be restored?<eos> Just how long it will take to restore power, we simply cannot determine at this time.<eos> We go to the streets for more on this.<eos> It is 'cause I messed up the song?<eos> Why you went all crazy like a maniac?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Okay, but... you do think I'm talented, right, Mr. Moreno?

- Okay, but what's your opinion?<eos> That's my opinion.<eos> What's your professional opinion?<eos> - My professional opinion? Well...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mylene...<eos> It's time you know what everybody below 59th Street knows, which is this:<eos> Nobody gives a fuck about my professional opinion, you know?<eos> And even if they did, in order for me to have a professional opinion, I'd have to have a fucking profession, which I don't.<eos> But you're Jackie Moreno... right?
Not anymore.<eos> I don't work for Marrakesh Star.<eos> I haven't had a hit in years, you know?<eos> I'm fucking... dead in this business, Mylene, okay?<eos> You know, I'm like a fugazi at this point, which means I'm a fucking fake.<eos> - That's who I am.<eos> - I'm sorry for your problems. I am.<eos> And I'm not gonna tell my uncle about none of this.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But will you then please help me find a real record producer and songwriter.

-So, fucking decide, Ezekiel.<eos> It's up to you but make the choice.<eos> Most of the kids in your class, and you know this, live with a slave mentality.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> The idea that if you smart and educated that somehow you ain't down or cool, or God forbid, you ain't even black.<eos> But if you remain ignorant and running the streets, then you real.<eos> It's the same reason you didn't get in front of the class and read your essay.<eos> Because you are afraid of being smart.<eos> You are afraid of your own God-given gift.<eos> -Says you.
No, he could do it.<eos> If he could fit us into his schedule.<eos> Mr. Gunns, I'm Ezekiel Figuero.<eos> You missed your appointment.<eos> -Look, I'm not here to kiss your ass.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> Or apologize for missing my appointment.<eos> That was a stupid mistake.<eos> Fatal, in fact.<eos> But I gave some thought to what you'd get out of this internship.
I'm on my way.<eos> Good cake.<eos> Forgive me, Mr. Asheton, Teddy Pendergrass, Line 2.<eos> - Take a message.<eos> - Did she say "Teddy Pendergrass"?<eos> So, Mr. Cruz,<eos> -like I said before--<eos> -Hold on for a second.<eos> I don't mean any disrespect, Roy.<eos> But if you're too big-time to take Teddy Pendergrass' phone call, how I know what you'll do with my phone calls?
I say we're a lot alike.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We're gonna shop around a little, then we'll get back to you.<eos> No, no, no, tío.<eos> I want this. I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.<eos> Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be at Marrakesh, same as Misty.<eos> I trust you to protect me and Jackie to guide me.<eos> I'll let you write the contract and I'll sign it, but we wanna be at Marrakesh.<eos> Fine.<eos> Roy, you're a serious man.
Just a thought.<eos> Holy shit, is this Corinthian granite?<eos> This looks like Corinthian granite to me.<eos> You don't usually see this attention to detail in a remodel at this price.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Nope.<eos> Smooth, rustic Corinthian granite.<eos> I don't know. Whoever did this place, they did a fucking good job.<eos> You guys gonna make an offer?<eos> - I'm gonna make an offer.<eos> Are you a real estate agent?
- Okay, I don't want any more.<eos> - I don't want any more.<eos> - I'm trying to be helpful. I don't know what to do.<eos> I thought I wanted to know all the details, but you know what?<eos> This is just too much details.<eos> Okay, well, I'm happy to stop, because this is just...<eos> Did you ever tell him that you loved him?<eos> N-no... no, I never did that.<eos> S-so... what would be most helpful now to...?<eos> I know you're not here for value judgments, but from a clinical standpoint, I mean, a pure, sort of medical profile of the moment, doesn't it sound like they did a shitload of fucking? Doesn't it?
I was reluctant to lawyer up, - but, hey, I gotta protect what's mine.<eos> - So smart.<eos> Mediation is like one person ends up with the cup, the other person ends up with the coffee, you know?<eos> Right.<eos> So, um, let's see what kind of assets we're talking about.<eos> It's not gonna look like a whole lot on paper, but I got a big project in the works.<eos> It's an indoor adventure experience called FunSpace.<eos> - Mm. - The, uh... the DBA is pending.<eos> And soon as it's rolling, whole financial picture's gonna change.<eos> Well, you're in great hands with Gerald Watkins Mayfield.
I run lean and mean so I can focus on winning cases.<eos> Fancy offices, hot secretaries, diplomas on the walls...<eos> I don't need that ego bullshit.<eos> Right.<eos> The good news for you is<eos> I don't charge what those midtown divorce lawyers charge.<eos> They can be 750 an hour.<eos> Holy fuck!<eos> Who's got that kind of green?<eos> Well, you might someday.
See, tour buses are key to the business model because I see this as a field trip destination.<eos> You know, let me ask you a quick question, how high do you think the average kid jumps on a trampoline?<eos> I... that, I'm not sure, no.<eos> Well, because it's gonna directly affect the height of the ceiling. - Right.<eos> - But I don't wanna stop the parents from jumping.<eos> - No.<eos> - I don't wanna do that because fun has no age limit.<eos> Son of a bitch, George.<eos> This is all you.<eos> You're the one that's motivating all of this.
I do not see him as a problem.<eos> I looked at his website.<eos> His main area of expertise would appear to be clip art.<eos> So, preliminarily, issue one...<eos> Excuse me, I'm sorry. it's just one more thing before we get too far along.<eos> Um, can you... can you just give me a sense of how much this is gonna cost?<eos> Well, that depends on your definition of cost, right?<eos> Because with me, you get a partner.<eos> We walk through this together.<eos> You are not stuck with some teenage summer associate.
I can't. I'm not having... I'm not...<eos> I'm not drinking any alcohol. Of course I would like to, but I'm not going to, but thank you.<eos> What is that, champagne?<eos> Looks good.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> So, are you... are you not drinking?<eos> No, I haven't had a drop since the night of Nick's accident.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - You're Diane, Nick Clavowen's wife, right?
No, thank you.<eos> So, are you... are you not drinking?<eos> No, I haven't had a drop since the night of Nick's accident.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - You're Diane, Nick Clavowen's wife, right?<eos> - Yes. - I'm Mickey Burgess.<eos> This is my show.<eos> So glad you're here.<eos> You and your husband bought
So you're just gonna keep on lying to Kelsey?<eos> All I know is that I can't start over in this business as a 40 year-old.<eos> I get it, but I want to live an authentic life, and that's just who I am.<eos> Okay, what if for now we just don't hang out with work people?<eos> [groaning] Look, I think I just... I think I need some time to wrap my head around all this.<eos> Okay.<eos> No problem. I'm sorry I'm so complicated.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> ♪ Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies ♪<eos> Yeah, you have a good day too, ma'am.
I'm wearing a bosom.<eos> Why? Because while a man can never truly know what it's like to be a woman, it doesn't mean he can't try.<eos> And...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I have never felt more beautiful.<eos> Oh, good Lord, what a... powerful, powerful message...<eos> A message that, if I have my way, will be heard by every man, woman, and post-pubescent child in this country.<eos> I am not going to sell this as a book. No, I'm going to sell this as an anthem, a call to action for a new generation.<eos> In my mind, "The Male Feminist"<eos> is "The Feminine Mystique" for the 21st century.<eos> And in Empirical's hands, you'll be nothing less than the new Betty Friedan.
Well, I guess she should have seen that one coming, right?<eos> Diana, I have some news.<eos> I, uh, I got an offer, uh, elsewhere. And I'm going to accept it.<eos> This isn't how I wanted to leave, but unfortunately I have to.<eos> Today.<eos> Liza, are you sure you know what you're doing?<eos> I do.<eos> And I just want to thank you for everything.<eos> I appreciate it all.<eos> More than you'll ever know.
Just think what fun it will be for your fans in Times Square.<eos> Are you ready to pick your Princess Pam Pam?<eos> Ah, yes, the best for last, my princess of the Highlands.<eos> Okay, this is Virginia, and as you see by her résumé, she has experience as both an actor and a model.<eos> And when you're ready, Virginia, you scan the battlefields and the wreckage wrought by your lightning bolts, and you declare...<eos> Beware the wrath of the sky.<eos> Beware the wrath of the sky.<eos> I'm so sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm just dropping off these refreshments for Mr. Moore.<eos> Here you are, sir.
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can actually be quite charming.<eos> Have the neighbors complained?<eos> Safe to say, they're asking questions.<eos> The rocks would prefer not to move, but we shall move them yet.<eos> Perhaps I can help you with that.<eos> The narrative you're creating is clearly a massive endeavor.<eos> If you need more time, I'm sure the board would be happy to oblige.<eos> I'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You imagine I have gone mad... do you?
But I told him we'd be fine, that you didn't understand what you were paying for.<eos> It's not a business venture, not a theme park, but an entire world.<eos> We designed every inch of it.<eos> Every blade of grass.<eos> In here, we were gods.<eos> And you were merely our guests.<eos> And how did that work out for Arnold?<eos> Sadly, he lost his perspective.<eos> He went mad.<eos> I haven't, as you well know.
And how did that work out for Arnold?<eos> Sadly, he lost his perspective.<eos> He went mad.<eos> I haven't, as you well know.<eos> I have always seen things very clearly.<eos> This is the table I sat at with my parents.<eos> This is the chair I sat in.<eos> We know everything about our guests, don't we?<eos> As we know everything about our employees.<eos> I do hope you will be careful with Bernard.
I don't think anyone in Madrid thought that people here are heartless.<eos> No one?<eos> For God's sake!<eos> You even went to the Royal Family to ask for money.<eos> That pious Reverend Father Poveda begging for help, and making a fool of the church in Guadix, which can't face up to the needs of their own poor.<eos> How embarrassing!<eos> I wonder what his Majesty thought?<eos> I never thought that the needs of the caves...<eos> Think?<eos> You never think of anything except your own affairs.

It's so soft.<eos> Can I try it on?<eos> I'll let you have my slingshot all day.<eos> No, for longer.<eos> Today and tomorrow.<eos> Please, Bishop, just a moment.<eos> No, no.<eos> Wait, Poveda.<eos> With everyone.<eos> You made this happen.
I'm not very fond of these things, that's all.<eos> I wish they would ignore me, both my good and bad points.<eos> Let's focus, we have to get on with class.<eos> And who lives here?<eos> Believe me, this is nonsense, it's absurd.<eos> Putting Poveda in the limelight.<eos> And it's not the frst time.<eos> Something was published about him a few days ago.<eos> And what's this about naming a street after him?<eos> Please, even you don't have a street.
Is that right?<eos> Yes, and I'm very disconcerted about what's going on.<eos> On one hand, they give me honors I don't deserve, and on the other, what little help that's coming in is decreasing.<eos> I'm concerned that without intending to, you're setting a bad example, It could look as if you are seeking the limelight.<eos> The limelight?<eos> - Yes, perhaps unintentionally.<eos> But with your attitude and your public profile, you are causing problems among the clergy of this diocese.<eos> Some have suggested a change.<eos> I'm at your disposal.<eos> You are my bishop.
Who was the man you said goodbye to this morning?<eos> Carlos...<eos> I think his name was Carlos.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Well, you know something?<eos> I had a brother too.<eos> But the rebels killed him last week.<eos> And I said to myself, why don't I kill some rebel's brother, so that they can feel the same as me?<eos> We are not rebels.<eos> You're a priest, which in this case is the same thing.
In about half an hour.<eos> But you'll have to run to catch it.<eos> Run, Father Pedrin!<eos> Run!<eos> Oh, what a fellow!<eos> Education is one of the pillars of democracy, as Professor Giner has said.<eos> We want to train men who are able to make decisions, free citizens.<eos> Students and teachers, sitting around this table, all equal, talking and debating as good comrades.<eos> It's important that we join forces, that we link up.<eos> So, you agree with the Law of Associations that has been presented in parliament?
These are setbacks.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> Help me, I beg you, soon.<eos> Oops!<eos> - Excuse me, Miss.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Have we met?<eos> - The teachers.<eos> You're the priest we met in Oviedo.
Now you'll tell me that you had no problems in Jaen...<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning<eos> I am Pedro Poveda, the new canon in the cathedral<eos> Do I have the pleasure of speaking with Mr Manuel Segovia?<eos> You do.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - I'd like to talk with your daughter Pepita.<eos> Forgive me, Father,<eos> And sorry to be so blunt, but you are too insistent.
Wow! We have a laboratory?<eos> That's great.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> - Good afternoon, Father.<eos> This is Father Pedro.<eos> What a joy to see this gallery of brilliant minds.<eos> Welcome.<eos> They say that a certain Pedro Poveda has already established several academies, with the latest one here, in Jaen.<eos> They have a perverse dogmatic background.<eos> I don't know if you know anything about the matter, Mr Echevarria?
Father!<eos> Would you excuse me?<eos> Father, this is Professor Luis Echevarria.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> I've been wanting to meet you personally.<eos> Me too.<eos> I've read some things in the newspapers about you, many of them, let's say, are not very good.<eos> Do you think that an attack on your person is being orchestrated?<eos> Let's not beat about the bush.<eos> You know the answer to that question as well as I do.

He's called Pedro Poveda.<eos> They say awful things about him and his academies.<eos> You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers.<eos> I told her not to come.<eos> That it's all a trick.<eos> I assure you that your daughter is fine.<eos> Marina, come on, come and open the door for your father.<eos> Yes, Father Pedro.<eos> Father Pedro?<eos> Are you the priest in the newspapers?
Yes, yes, carry on.<eos> This is an extraordinary case in which the evidence for the prosecution is undisputed and the case for the prosecution is, in a way, also the case for the defense.<eos> On a murder charge, the prosecution has to prove that the act was both unlawful and intentional.<eos> We intend to prove that there was no act to which the law attaches legal consequences.<eos> Are you suggesting there was no act when we have seven bodies?<eos> My lord is entitled to be skeptical.<eos> The prosecution has been at pains to explain what has happened.<eos> We intend to explain why these events happened and whether the accused can be held criminally responsible.<eos> Well, you'd better explain very carefully what the defense is, as I'm at a loss to understand.<eos> How can you say there was no act when you've admitted that the accused killed the seven deceased?
The relationships that Leon formed with the men he hanged have to had an impact on him.<eos> I need to go, John.<eos> Good night.<eos> Who's that?<eos> If that's who I think it is, we're in for a rough ride.<eos> Please, could you inform the court as to how many men were executed in your final year at maximum.<eos> Please consult the execution register, which has been submitted as evidence.<eos> 164.<eos> 164 hangings in a single year, which was a record, I believe.<eos> And you were present when these men were admitted and you were also present when they were executed.
My lord, we have to use a name in this instance as the prisoner, before he was hanged, may have developed a relationship with the accused.<eos> Further, my lord, the evidence supplied and the names thereon are a matter of public record, not confidential at all.<eos> I've given the defense a lot of leeway in this case, far more than i ever imagined I would in a case like this.<eos> I expect the same solicitude from the defense in future.<eos> Mr. labuschagne, how well did you know the prisoner, eben christiaan coetzee?<eos> I read the Bible to him.<eos> To any prisoner who requested it.<eos> Eben was 19 years old, correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Eben had a wife and daughter, and I believe you have a daughter, don't you?
To any prisoner who requested it.<eos> Eben was 19 years old, correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Eben had a wife and daughter, and I believe you have a daughter, don't you?<eos> Esme.<eos> You met his wife and daughter.<eos> They came to say goodbye to him.<eos> I walked them back to the car park through the prison garden.<eos> And they thanked me for looking after him.<eos> You believed that eben should have been reprieved?
You had no thoughts, no feelings, no emotions.<eos> Mr. labuschagne, are you all right?<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> My lord, I'd like to press on.<eos> Are you feeling faint?<eos> I might be sick. My lord.<eos> My lord, I'd like to approach my client.<eos> Mr. weber, if the accused needs medical attention, the court will adjourn.<eos> My lord, I'm near the end of this line of questioning...<eos> You are at the end, Mr. weber.
My lord, I'm near the end of this line of questioning...<eos> You are at the end, Mr. weber.<eos> The court is adjourned.<eos> How could you be so cruel?<eos> It is your job to protect him, not to hurt him.<eos> My job is to defend him, miss labuschagne.<eos> That's all I'm trying to do.<eos> You don't need to abuse him to defend him.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm doing my best.<eos> You don't care if he hangs, do you?
But the storm was really bad.<eos> What happened, Mr. labuschagne?<eos> AllI canremember ishowtiredIwas.<eos> HowtiredIwas ofeverything.<eos> The minibus...<eos> There was almost another accident.<eos> You remember what happened?<eos> Mr. labuschagne, what happened after you nearly had an accident with the minibus?<eos> Youfollowedthemup thequarryroad tomagazinehill.<eos> Once you and the driver reached the dead end at the quarry, what occurred?
I suggest to you that your evidence that you were upset by the execution process and the work you had to do in the pit room is just a facade and that, in truth, you actually enjoyed the work.<eos> In fact, you got used to this special work very quickly, didn't you?<eos> The special work of killing.<eos> That must've made you feel important and powerful, knowing that you could kill and not be prosecuted for it.<eos> No one except us knew about the work we're doing.<eos> So, how would that make me feel important or powerful?<eos> Don't ask me questions.<eos> You knew you were immune to prosecution, that you had the blessing of the law, didn't you?<eos> We didn't do the killing, the hangman did.<eos> Yet you've told the court that you had to pull prisoners up by the neck and drop them again, haven't you?
Is that how we are to understand your evidence?<eos> But I can't remember!<eos> So, your defense is not that you didn't shoot them, but that you can't remember shooting them.<eos> Is that how we are to understand it?<eos> My lord, it's not for the accused to answer questions of law.<eos> I alone can answer questions such as those proposed by my learned friend.<eos> No more questions, my lord.<eos> Mr. weber, do you intend to re-examine the accused?<eos> If it pleases my lord.<eos> You killed them.
Mr. weber, do you intend to re-examine the accused?<eos> If it pleases my lord.<eos> You killed them.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. labuschagne?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, it must've been me.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Two years ago, you were a school prefect and active in the church.
Isn't that right?<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. labuschagne?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, it must've been me.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Two years ago, you were a school prefect and active in the church.<eos> And now you're here in court, on trial for murder.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You were a husband, a father, but now neither your wife nor your daughter will visit you in the cells and they've not attended court, either, have they?
Have you seen these?<eos> What is this, Bernard?<eos> Doesn't look like anything to me.<eos> Theycannotseethe things that will hurt them.<eos> I've spared them that.<eos> Theirlivesareblissful.<eos> In a way, their existence is purer than ours, freed of the burden of self-doubt.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You're a fucking monster.
But hey, at least they're letting you keep your shares and your board seat.<eos> You lose a little blood with the dilution for the new CEO, but I've seen worse.<eos> Like that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman.<eos> If we give Richard a little bit of space, he'll be able to wrap his head around this, and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible.<eos> To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat...<eos> Mr. Bachman.<eos> In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested, you will not be CEO.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order.
And I don't care how much money I lose, because I am gonna get it all back when I sue the living shit out of you!<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Ron, let's go.<eos> Sorry, I'm forced to inform you that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're my attorney.<eos> No.<eos> Technically, I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel, and you just declared your intention to walk. So, in effect, you kind of just threatened to sue me, and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr. Hendricks.
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam?<eos> Yes, but at least this way, I don't have to eat shit.<eos> Richard, let me tell you something I learned here on the inside.<eos> Swallow your pride, or soon you'll be eating something far worse than shit.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Don't you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow?<eos> So where are we?<eos> Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.<eos> Their negated options total 780,000 shares.<eos> That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.
So where are we?<eos> Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.<eos> Their negated options total 780,000 shares.<eos> That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.<eos> Employee bonuses, renovations to the day-care center.<eos> What have you.<eos> What should we prioritize?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand.<eos> It's all in the document.<eos> You take that severance package, and you leave Hooli immediately.
Well, you're queer.<eos> Ain't you?<eos> - Usual spot?<eos> - If it ain't broke.<eos> See you then.<eos> You done with Mr. Williams' desk, Tommy?<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Joni?<eos> Can you come with me, please?<eos> Some of your coworkers told us that you and Mr. Williams sometimes carpool together.

Your husband, what's his name?<eos> Lloyd McKinnon Conway Jr.<eos> Goes by Mac.<eos> As in Quan Thang<eos> Lloyd McKinnon Conway Jr.?<eos> My husband didn't...<eos> - what does my husband have to do with this?<eos> - So, Cliff, did he have a girlfriend he ever talked about, - any relationship problems?<eos> - Y'all think... y'all think that someone did this to him, is that it?<eos> You're over on Glenview, right?
What a surprise.<eos> The six degenerates sitting around doing nothing.<eos> Marty, shouldn't you be cleaning drawings of boners off bathroom stalls?<eos> For your information, I already rubbed out three in the boys' room this morning.<eos> The reason I am here is because I read an article that said if you give underperforming teachers new challenges, you get big results.<eos> I immediately thought of this group.<eos> Because we get big results?<eos> No.<eos> Principal Pearson loved my idea so I will be assigning each of you new extracurricular activities.<eos> Ms. Snap, you will be in charge of the after-school gifted program.
I'm responsible for 97% of the marches on city hall this year.<eos> Mrs. Adler, Ms. Feldman, you will be assisting with field day.<eos> Ah, this will be just like being a wedding planner, but without all the homicidal feelings of jealous.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll make you guys feel super involved.<eos> Not necessary.<eos> These two control freaks in charge? - Mama's not doing shiz. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I often forget that you're here.

How'd you know?<eos> Mary Louise, you thought a blow job was a fancy hairdo.<eos> What else would it be?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ Tear it down ♪<eos> Ms. Snap?<eos> Hi, I'm Charles's mother Rita.<eos> - Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> I heard you're running the after-school gifted program.
Hi, I'm Charles's mother Rita.<eos> - Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> I heard you're running the after-school gifted program.<eos> How'd you hear that?<eos> I was just assigned it this morning.<eos> Well, I am the president of the PTA.<eos> I hear everything.<eos> [both chuckle] You know what?<eos> I want you to put my son in the gifted program.
I'll catch up with her.<eos> Say, could I...<eos> I don't mean to be too much trouble, but it's so darn hot outside.<eos> Can I bother you for an ice-cold Coca-Cola?<eos> Why, of course.<eos> Just Coke coke?<eos> We got root beer, too.<eos> Root beer would be divine.<eos> - Thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You, my dear, are a life saver.
They're left over from when it used to be a men's prison.<eos> There's a bunch of them back here.<eos> The guards could live on campus back then.<eos> It was nice.<eos> By the lake.<eos> Uh, when the lake was still nice.<eos> I had no idea these were even back here.<eos> We used to stay in little cabins like this in the summer, when I was a kid, before my dad got into dog-dyeing.<eos> You're gonna explain, aren't you?<eos> I mean, only if you want me to.
No matter what size, uh, the audience.<eos> If it's 50 people, 37 books and I'm wondering, you know, is it fixed?<eos> Do you think it's fixed? Thank you so much, Deborah.<eos> But I think we better get things started, yeah?<eos> Everyone, it is my pleasure to introduce the holder of the Dorot Chair in Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and the author of Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,<eos> Deborah Lipstadt.<eos> Whatever the reasons that people become deniers, when you look closely, they often have an agenda which they won't admit to.<eos> So denial is a pick to undo the lock to open the door to something else.<eos> Yes.<eos> Somebody told me you don't debate with people who say the Holocaust didn't happen.
Actually, I don't really think about him that much.<eos> I don't think he's worth my time.<eos> Yes, sir. Gentleman in the back.<eos> Professor Lipstadt.<eos> Uh, let me reveal something to you, Professor.<eos> I am that David Irving about whom you have been so rude.<eos> Yes, yes, I am he.<eos> And it puzzles me that you think yourself qualified to attack me, given that I have 30 years' experience in the archives and my books have been published by some of the greatest publishing houses in the world.<eos> Viking Press, William Morrow, E.P. Dutton.<eos> I have to conclude that the reason you don't engage with people you disagree with is because you can't and you might learn some facts.
I have to conclude that the reason you don't engage with people you disagree with is because you can't and you might learn some facts.<eos> Facts, Miss Lipstadt, which don't suit your opinions.<eos> Well?<eos> Well?<eos> Mr. Irving, I will not debate you.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not ever.<eos> So if you would please just sit down and you can go and speak in another room at another time.<eos> You want gullible students to believe that there are mounds of documents which prove a Holocaust.
Come and get one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> $1,000!<eos> $1,000!<eos> An example of real history.<eos> I hope you find it edifying.<eos> Real history opposed to manufactured history and sentimentalized.<eos> Today I've heard you telling lies to students.<eos> ...speak in another room at another time.<eos> You want gullible students to believe...
I have two essential qualifications for David Irving.<eos> I'm a woman and I'm a Jew.<eos> He gets more bang for his buck.<eos> So this is your book on denial he's objecting to?<eos> Correct. Did you even mention Irving?<eos> What did you say about him?<eos> I think I called him a Hitler partisan who distorted evidence in order to reach historically untenable conclusions.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you better get yourself lawyered up.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You must be Anthony Julius.

Diana.<eos> So far, I've raised, um, most of my funds back home.<eos> Was that easy?<eos> It wasn't difficult.<eos> Not as difficult as in London, is that what you're saying?<eos> There's a principle and I've stuck to it.<eos> No single source of finance.<eos> There was one man, he offered to pay for the whole thing.<eos> But when the history of this moment comes to be written, I think it's important many people gave, not one.<eos> You talk about history.
He came with a chisel?<eos> That's right.<eos> And he hacked away...<eos> Correct. ...illegally, without any permission from the authorities, and then he smuggled the pieces out of Poland in his suitcase, wrapped in his dirty underwear.<eos> Be that as it may. We can criticize his methods, but it's his conclusions we have to discredit.<eos> He found higher levels of HCN here in the delousing chambers than he did in the gas chambers themselves.<eos> From this he concluded that no human beings were killed at Auschwitz. Only... Only lice were killed.<eos> Why are we talking about Leuchter?<eos> I mean, he's really not worth the paper he's written on.<eos> Well, so you say.
It beggars belief.<eos> Why has there not been a proper scientific study of this whole site?<eos> By reputable scientists?<eos> Fifty years since the fact?<eos> I mean, it's ridiculous.<eos> Where's the proof?<eos> Where's the evidence?<eos> I need to know that.<eos> You know what? This is a place where you show respect.<eos> Whoever you are, you show respect.
I'm surprised it's our choice.<eos> Well, it isn't.<eos> He has to agree.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> We have a notion.<eos> And the other one?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Well, you said a couple of decisions.<eos> Yes, well, um...<eos> We decided, Anthony and I, that, um, it would be better if you didn't testify.
In the sketches and on the computer?<eos> One of my students did, yes.<eos> But the wire mesh is an addition, it is not based on drawings and blueprints, is it?<eos> It is based on the drawing made by the man who actually made these pillars.<eos> Michael Kula.<eos> In the camp workshop.<eos> And this hole in the roof, or these holes, how many wire mesh columns were there?<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> Professor Pelt, we are wasting our time, really, are we not?<eos> You yourself have stood on that roof and looked for those holes and not found them.
That's it, that's the technique.<eos> ...will roll up her sleeve and show you the tattoo to prove that, yes, she was in Auschwitz.<eos> Do you think Irving's gonna respect them?<eos> You want that?<eos> Holocaust survivors mocked and humiliated?<eos> You've got to get tasteless.<eos> I shall say, "Mrs. Altman, how much money "have you made out of that tattoo since 1945?"<eos> You want more of that, do you?<eos> You think that's helpful?<eos> So, now, Mr. Irving, I will ask you to explain why, if, as you claim, there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz, the gratings taken in 1945 by the Polish authorities from Morgue 1 in Crematorium ll were covered in cyanide,
But can you really see lots of very heavily armed men running the two and a half to three miles from the SS barracks to a cellar at the far end of Birkenau?<eos> You see... I'm trying to understand if there was this, this dual function, so see if you can help me.<eos> Now, if the corpses were also gassed there, then, as I understand it, they were then sent to be incinerated?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is the point in gassing a corpse that is about to be burnt?<eos> I'm not sure, saying this off the top of my head, Mr. Rampton.<eos> I'm not a Holocaust historian,<eos> I'm a Hitler historian.<eos> Then why don't you keep your mouth shut about the Holocaust?<eos> The truth is, as usual, Mr. Irving, you jump in off the board spouting whatever rubbish comes into your head in order to avoid the obvious conclusion.
You were preparing a case.<eos> You had to be sure.<eos> However disrespectful you seemed. However heartless.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I didn't know what to expect.<eos> It was. ..<eos> It was a brief.<eos> I mean, my previous brief, believe it or not, was from McDonald's.<eos> How could Auschwitz be just another brief?<eos> I am sorry that perhaps you felt that that's what it was to me.
Detective James Shay.<eos> I'd like to talk to you about your old alma mater, Preston Hall.<eos> You roomed with Damien Thorn.<eos> We shared the same dorm.<eos> Something happened to him?<eos> Not to him.<eos> I'm investigating a series of suspicious deaths.<eos> What sort of deaths?<eos> Well, they've been ruled accidents.<eos> Seems you don't believe that.
There was an initiation for this secret club we had.<eos> Skull and Bones secret?<eos> We'd spray butane over our hands and then light them on fire.<eos> The butane would always burn out quickly.<eos> No one ever got hurt.<eos> I'm not sure what he did, but Thorn pushed Powell to do it.<eos> And then he just watched him burn.<eos> Like he got off on it.<eos> Poor kid suffered third-and fourth-degree burns over half his body.<eos> You blame Thorn?
And then he just watched him burn.<eos> Like he got off on it.<eos> Poor kid suffered third-and fourth-degree burns over half his body.<eos> You blame Thorn?<eos> Weird stuff always happens around him,<eos> I can't explain.<eos> I'll look up this Powell.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> You promise Thorn will never know I was here, right?<eos> I'll mind my tongue, you mind yours.
Wouldn't that make...<eos> Wouldn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Just to have him gone!<eos> You know, is... is... Is that not our responsibility?<eos> You know, when we... When we encounter evil, shouldn't we destroy it?<eos> Is that your call to make?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not... I'm not a murderer.<eos> I never will be. But how do I know... how do I know I made the right choice? How do I know that it wasn't the evil part of me that let this monster live?<eos> - You said I get to choose, right? - Yeah.
Things made more sense in the field, huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whatever's going on, man, I'm with you.<eos> Till the very end.<eos> I'm gonna have a beer.<eos> You want one?<eos> Hello, Charles.<eos> My name is Dr. Matthews.<eos> I'm here to have a little chat with you.<eos> Who are you?
No fucking way.<eos> Yes fucking way, Karen.<eos> You called the cops?<eos> What can I say?<eos> My feelings were hurt.<eos> - A price I would gladly pay to teach you a long overdue lesson.<eos> Now, Glenn, why is it that these ties look like they were dipped in shit?<eos> - Shit, Mr. Filosa?<eos> - Shit. Yes.<eos> Sir, you asked for Scarlet Forest, and I assure you these ties are all Scarlet Forest.
Your friend, your... your dad.<eos> You know, you've been through a lot, Marcus.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You know, my mama died when I was about your age, so I know how tough it can be.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> Cancer.<eos> - Did you cry?<eos> Do you still miss her?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I do.<eos> So, did, um... did you and my dad do missions and stuff together?
Oh, uh, hang on.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want you to meet some friends of mine.<eos> This is Mac and his better half, Joni.<eos> Felix.<eos> - Felix is one of my regulars.<eos> - One of her favorite regulars.<eos> Second favorite.<eos> Mrs. Qualls tips better.<eos> You ought to tip her better.
I know you ain't deaf, boy.<eos> I said go on and get inside.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Curfew's sundown.<eos> Everybody inside till morning. A curfew?<eos> What in the world for?<eos> Mama, come look!<eos> Breaking news... Eugene Linwood, arrested in the alleged beating of a 13-year-old boy, has been released with officials citing a lack of evidence.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mr. Linwood, did you beat that boy?
Come on.<eos> Conway!<eos> The fuck?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Now put the goddamn gun down.<eos> You need to get the fuck out of here.<eos> I said put the goddamn gun down!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Raise your fucking hands!<eos> You have no idea what the fuck you're walking into, okay?
He told you, too.<eos> - The movies, right?<eos> - "Enter the Dragon."<eos> I loved it myself.<eos> He was on the fence.<eos> - It was okay.<eos> - Back to Buck Rogers.<eos> - I want to call my lawyer.<eos> - So you did do something.<eos> No, you're putting words in my mouth now.
- I want to call my lawyer.<eos> - So you did do something.<eos> No, you're putting words in my mouth now.<eos> He wants to talk to his lawyer. Mmm.<eos> The phones still down?<eos> Phones are still down.<eos> So might take a while.<eos> The Knapp Commission?<eos> It's cops like you guys, right?<eos> Let me guess, you read "The New York Times."
No, you're putting words in my mouth now.<eos> He wants to talk to his lawyer. Mmm.<eos> The phones still down?<eos> Phones are still down.<eos> So might take a while.<eos> The Knapp Commission?<eos> It's cops like you guys, right?<eos> Let me guess, you read "The New York Times."<eos> Look, whatever you guys think I did, I didn't do it.<eos> Well, we think you killed Buck Rogers.
Let me guess, you read "The New York Times."<eos> Look, whatever you guys think I did, I didn't do it.<eos> Well, we think you killed Buck Rogers.<eos> But you're saying that somebody else did. So who might that be?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Who you trying to protect? Nobody.<eos> I just...<eos> I respect that, Richie.<eos> I do.<eos> You're a stand-up guy.
I respect that, Richie.<eos> I do.<eos> You're a stand-up guy.<eos> You think Joe Corso would do the same for you?<eos> What?<eos> You think he'd cover your ass?<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> I don't know, okay?<eos> You know where he is right now... Corso?<eos> I mean, not literally. Just for example while you're sitting in here.

Wasn't his place to do that.<eos> Jimmy thought it was.<eos> This is not yours to play with.<eos> It's not a game.<eos> You're a smart man.<eos> Be smart.<eos> You think what it might mean to combine ancient teachings with knowledge of the future.<eos> And then?<eos> Do what with it?<eos> What the hell did you and Jimmy do together?
Hairies out!<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm, uh... I'm looking for someone to take me to meet the Hairy people.<eos> Hey, man, she's on the news.<eos> You wanna be my tour guide?<eos> Got 10 bucks?<eos> She wants to see the Hairies, but we thought we should check with Waruu first. Hi.<eos> I'm Belinda Frosche.<eos> - I know exactly who you are.
How rapidly she's been able to integrate herself into the General Hospital population.<eos> They feel strongly that...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Miss Montgomery.<eos> Sorry.<eos> They feel strongly that now is the right time for Charlotte...<eos> Miss Montgomery, I've read the same reports that you have.<eos> Well, the doctors...<eos> The doctors can speak for themselves.<eos> You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe should Charlotte DiLaurentis leave the hospital.
- May we see her?<eos> - Not so good right now.<eos> - I want to see her.<eos> - You have to wait.<eos> Why can't I see her?<eos> If one read about cancer in a book, it said, it was a Zodiac in the Northern Hemisphere.<eos> Their sister can't possibly take care of the children.<eos> - I'm not talking about my sister.<eos> - We have looked at your request.<eos> You have no permanent home.
But he can't.<eos> Elmer's clubfoot always gets hurt if he has to carry heavy things.<eos> Well.<eos> It'll likely go.<eos> Now start in the field and we'll see if there should be a man in Elmer.<eos> From now, speak only when the Principal asks you about something.<eos> - Enjoy your meal.<eos> - Thanks for the food!<eos> Here's the classroom.<eos> Besides teaching you will have responsibility for mail distribution, as well as helping in the infirmary with Mrs. Oskarson.
- Enjoy your meal.<eos> - Thanks for the food!<eos> Here's the classroom.<eos> Besides teaching you will have responsibility for mail distribution, as well as helping in the infirmary with Mrs. Oskarson.<eos> - Any questions?<eos> - No.<eos> You're really sure?<eos> Miss Hammershøi, with your background from good schools, including girls' schools, I will ensure you understand the need for discipline.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're probably aware that the beating was abolished earlier this year?
There have been problems with his big brother?<eos> - It is not unthinkable.<eos> - It may be the boy's own fault?<eos> He won't say anything, so much looks like that.<eos> - I'll drive him to the hospital.<eos> - I've examined him.<eos> It is not so bad with him.<eos> He becomes healthy again.<eos> This must ever never happen again.<eos> Toft Lassen, you are responsible for keeping an eye on the boys.
Come here! Come here.<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here! Down in the basement with him.<eos> - Relax!<eos> Your uncle was very upset.<eos> He loves you dearly, but he... He doesn't feel he's good enough to take care of you yet.<eos> I'm sure he'll come and visit you as soon as he...<eos> I had to tell it.<eos> There wasn't anyone to help you out there.<eos> - You're like the others. - No.
Gonna take the spectacles off.<eos> Okay, my little learning lizards, why don't we pull out our workbooks that we work on every day?<eos> Brad, can you, uh, tell me the answer to number one on page 24?<eos> No, you made us turn our notebooks into origami.<eos> Remember?<eos> On that day that we did the "Karate Kid" marathon.<eos> Forget the workbooks!<eos> Why don't we move on to social studies?<eos> How many studies do we think are social, hmm?<eos> Who are you?
You've taken everything from me.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I know I seemed crazy earlier, but that's only because the other teachers talked me into not teaching my normal crazy way.<eos> I don't know how to act normal, so it seemed crazy.<eos> And now this seems crazy, Goddammit.<eos> Look, I'm a really good teacher.<eos> You should see me teach multiplication using Lionel Richie's "Three Times a Lady."<eos> It's like Dead Poets Society.<eos> Just stop talking.<eos> You're a train wreck.
Oh, my God, again?<eos> Seriously, what are you doing?<eos> If you don't want this, then why did you kiss me at Fitzpatrick's?<eos> What?<eos> I kissed everybody that night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - She got me.<eos> She did.<eos> - I got tongue.<eos> You kissed everybody that night?
I can hear it in your voice.<eos> Ohh. Well, we're fine, but...<eos> Shit.<eos> Is this... A flower guy? Yes.<eos> I arranged them myself.<eos> His name is Ramone.<eos> - Ramone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Delivery from Mrs. Hendrix. Oh.<eos> You, uh, must be her sister.
Miss Carter.<eos> Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Thank you for collecting me. I hope it wasn't a bother.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm delighted to see you again. Shall we?<eos> Um, Mr. Jarvis...<eos> Yes?<eos> I understand Howard came out west for a defense contract.<eos> He did.<eos> And you did say you came out here to arrange his estate.
I understand Howard came out west for a defense contract.<eos> He did.<eos> And you did say you came out here to arrange his estate.<eos> I think I see where this is heading.<eos> - What I don't understand...<eos> - You're puzzled, perhaps.<eos> Uh, puzzled, yes, that's the word.<eos> It's the flamingo, isn't it?<eos> It is, indeed, the flamingo.<eos> Regrettably, you are not the only house guest to whom Mr. Stark has extended an invitation.
I hope you'll forgive me, but what you're about to experience will change your life forever.<eos> I'm not one for surprises.<eos> Taste this.<eos> Are you poisoning me?<eos> Well, that's ethanol, so...<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I'm usually a-a whiskey girl, but this is the best wine I've ever tasted.<eos> See? !<eos> See, I realized that by manipulating the oxygen in the malic and succinic acids, I could tweak the pH balan...<eos> So you're a genius.

I don't know.<eos> I suppose I was expecting someone more...<eos> Like Mr. Jarvis?<eos> In a girdle?<eos> Precisely. From his tales of your heroics, I was picturing a circus strongman in a wig.<eos> I've selected a few potential ensembles for the racetrack, but I've also sewed you...<eos> This.<eos> What is it?<eos> That's also a holster.<eos> You are fantastic.
Assemble rifles? I trust you to distract her with your flattery.<eos> Aside from "Danger," my middle name is "Charm."<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Miss Frost? Edwin Jarvis.<eos> Head of production, Stark Pictures.<eos> Oh.<eos> Might I have a word?<eos> Mr. Chadwick, I am one of your biggest advocates for Senate.<eos> What a delight to see such an attractive young woman like yourself interested in politics.<eos> If you don't beat that ugly old representative Anderson, California is gonna go to hell in hand basket.
Well...<eos> Thank you for your support.<eos> Are you aware that Miss Scott is dead?<eos> Who did you say you are, Miss?<eos> Agent Peggy Carter with the SSR.<eos> When was the last time you saw Miss Scott?<eos> Is it SSR protocol to surprise people with the death notices of their employees?<eos> I understand she was more privileged than an employee.<eos> Is your wife aware you were having an affair?<eos> You would be perfect for the lead role in a new Stark Pictures production.
Shouldn't I get a phone call?<eos> Where's Peggy?<eos> Carter?<eos> She's moved on to a new case.<eos> You're yesterday's news for her.<eos> But who's gonna interrogate me?<eos> My boss and I... We used to have this routine to get suspects to turn.<eos> He was the carrot, and I was the stick.<eos> He spoke smoothly, and I didn't speak at all.<eos> See, the problem is, is that you and your Commie friends, well... You killed the carrot.
If whatever killed detective Henry and the medical examiner is contagious, then we've all been exposed.<eos> I'm guessing that whatever it is, you can't get it unless you've been exposed to contaminated blood.<eos> The medical examiner had the most intense and prolonged exposure, which may explain why he succumbed first.<eos> At your earliest convenience, I'm going to need a written report stating exactly what Detective Henry told you.<eos> I'll get it to you immediately.<eos> I want to thank you properly for saving my life, Agent Carter.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> How about dinner and dancing?<eos> This Saturday evening?<eos> You're a brave man.
Are you familiar?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No. You wrote a letter to Attorney General Kennedy, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> He was not able to help you with your particular case, and sent your letter to the American Civil Liberties Union.<eos> The ACLU contacted me, I'm a lawyer in Virginia, and we would like to help you with your case.<eos> I see.<eos> - Momma!<eos> - Don, baby, hush.<eos> Would it be possible for you and your husband to meet with me?
I wouldn't go without him.<eos> You know, Richard, it's, of course, up to you not to attend but, you should know, the Supreme Court only hears one out of every 400 cases.<eos> It's historic.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Cohen.<eos> Well. Is there anything you'd like me to say to them?<eos> And by "them" I mean the Supreme Court justices of the United States?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can tell the judge...<eos> Tell the judge I love my wife.<eos> You okay to park?
- Let me first explain our services.<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Please refer to our company as "Aznable".<eos> The basic package of ceremony attendance is $80/day.<eos> Additional speeches are $50.<eos> Entertainers for $50, and telegrams for $30.<eos> If there's anything else, we'll be able to provide it.<eos> Please take a look.<eos> It isn't cheap.<eos> No, but since you're Ramba Ral's friend I'll give you a discount.
Pardon my asking, but do you have to quit?<eos> I apologize.<eos> I'm really... I have to say that...<eos> My daughter only wants you as her teacher.<eos> What?<eos> Could you continue her lessons?<eos> There are much better teachers out there.<eos> She doesn't want anyone else.<eos> She hasn't been to school in 5 months.<eos> For my daughter, you are her one and only teacher.
Thank you for coming.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Some wine?<eos> I broke up with her.<eos> What?<eos> I'm talking about that bitch.<eos> Just thinking about her with someone else made me sick.<eos> It was too much.<eos> I see.<eos> I bet you can't forgive your husband either.
Hand out flyers!<eos> Do whatever you want!<eos> I don't care!<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> That'll be the end for your husband.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Do whatever you want!<eos> Calm down and think about it.<eos> If this solves things, it's good for you too.<eos> You can't forgive your husband.
Interesting.<eos> - Lets do it L<eos> - No, we should get home.<eos> Why?<eos> Let's get closer.<eos> That's great!<eos> Look over here now.<eos> Good!<eos> This is embarrassing.<eos> I bet you work in this industry.
- It's a shellfish.<eos> I forget its name.<eos> A cone snail.<eos> To think that this can kill you...<eos> When you do this...<eos> How much do you make for bringing a person like her?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It's not a matter of money.<eos> I just wondered how much you get out of this.

It's $100,000.
I apologize for my forwardness.<eos> Does Shochu work for you?<eos> No, I drove here.<eos> I'll call a driver for you so grab a glass.<eos> Bide the spirits away.<eos> Oh no, what have we here...<eos> That's enough, thank you.<eos> That's good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're quite the drinker.
Let me get our Vice President of narrative.<eos> Okay.<eos> If it's make-up-your-own-title day,<eos> I am now...<eos> Badass goddess detective.<eos> You have called yourself that for years.<eos> Now, it's official.<eos> Paul was so vibrant, talented.<eos> He was my top story strategist.<eos> - And you were his?
And what would we run them against?<eos> CODIS didn't exist. Tests cost a small fortune.<eos> Back then, dead suspect, no trial?<eos> There's no way the city of New York spends the money.<eos> Okay, enough Captain-versus-Captain.<eos> Hey, Hauser, you know what, why don't you check on the watchdog?<eos> I think he's getting a little nervous.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Uh... You and Hauser butting heads, I expected.
Who let the grieving husband contaminate my crime scene?<eos> Looky-loos got their phones out.<eos> If you're afraid to do your job, I suggest you find another.<eos> Please tell me the roof has been secured.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Did you see anything?<eos> Mr. Warner?<eos> Mr. Warner?<eos> I'm Detective Andrea Cornell.<eos> I know this is impossibly difficult, but can you please let go of the victim?
Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> It's... it's the hormones, baby.<eos> I'm just... I'm emotional.<eos> We hadn't told anyone yet.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Patrick.<eos> Detective...<eos> I know you are just doing your job... and...<eos> Your reputation precedes you... but I am an attorney with the...<eos> I know who you are, counselor.
It's... it's the hormones, baby.<eos> I'm just... I'm emotional.<eos> We hadn't told anyone yet.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Patrick.<eos> Detective...<eos> I know you are just doing your job... and...<eos> Your reputation precedes you... but I am an attorney with the...<eos> I know who you are, counselor.<eos> You work for the Public Defender's office.
No.<eos> I have to get my stuff.<eos> I'll... I'll get it for you.<eos> All right.<eos> No glove, no love, Detective.<eos> Counselor.<eos> An officer will need to follow your brother home to take custody of his clothes for processing.<eos> We'll be at my father's.<eos> I'm sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> We'll have to do forensic tests in the morning, so I suggest you and your family stay away from the office.
Amanda said you would do this.<eos> - Do what, exactly?<eos> - Eric, don't.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Please... stop talking to her.<eos> You're my lawyer, right?<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> You want to know if I was on that roof?<eos> Oh, I already know.<eos> The office windows don't open, and Kate's body was too close to the building for you to look out and see it.
- Eric, don't.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Please... stop talking to her.<eos> You're my lawyer, right?<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> You want to know if I was on that roof?<eos> Oh, I already know.<eos> The office windows don't open, and Kate's body was too close to the building for you to look out and see it.<eos> So the only way you could know that your wife was on the ground is if you were on the roof.<eos> And if you talked to me, instead of talking to everyone else about me, you would know I have an explanation.
He seems to be coping?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Oh, I would hope during this time that he stays engaged.<eos> If he needs help with schoolwork, please know he still has access to teachers and to resources online.<eos> What are you doing about what happened to him?<eos> We looked into the situation, and there are individuals who will be disciplined.<eos> Disciplined?<eos> I can't go into specifics with you.<eos> Anyone who's involved deserves a measure of privacy.<eos> Well, y-you don't care about my son's privacy.
What he was doing?<eos> What he was doing?<eos> You mean what was done to him!<eos> You asked us to look into this, and we did.<eos> No, what was done to him!<eos> My son was raped!<eos> You need to be careful with that word.<eos> If somebody messed him up, they touched him... That is rape.<eos> You need to be very careful with that word.<eos> You sat in that room. You were emotional.
You sat in that room. You were emotional.<eos> You told a story that was barely coherent and made accusations, as you put it, based on things your son didn't say.<eos> He was drugged.<eos> His girlfriend was there. She saw him.<eos> You came in and made a statement.<eos> Six times, you used the phrase "I don't know" or "I'm not sure."<eos> You signed that statement.<eos> Just to say that I talked to somebody!<eos> Your son didn't volunteer to come forward.<eos> You're making a claim in his absence only after the pictures surfaced.
Your son didn't volunteer to come forward.<eos> You're making a claim in his absence only after the pictures surfaced.<eos> I came in as soon as I knew.<eos> We've taken disciplinary action appropriate -- what are you doing to those boys?<eos> The suspension given your son is fair, and it's correct.<eos> Take the time to be with your son, to engage him, to help him make better choices.<eos> He didn't choose this.<eos> I know you want to believe your son, but consider what it means to falsely accuse other young men of something that is -- quite frankly, it's bizarre.<eos> As bad as it may seem, it can get worse.<eos> We have counseling services if you and your son would like to speak with...
Opening up the pericardium now.<eos> - Ready with suction.<eos> - Okay, retract.<eos> The general wants an update, Major.<eos> Could go either way.<eos> - Sir, you can't come in.<eos> - Give me my wife!<eos> - Get the hell out of here!<eos> - You can't do that! She is open on our table.<eos> You're not sterile. You need to get the hell out of here.
The rental market is more murderous than any supernatural beast we've fought.<eos> Not a peep on that front.<eos> 'Tis a respite I fear will not last.<eos> This is Sleepy Hollow, after all.<eos> You are missed.<eos> Never forgotten.<eos> Mr. Crane.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say the words you spoke at Abbie's service were quite lovely...<eos> We don't have much time, Crane.<eos> Abigail's death has set wheels in motion, and you need all the information I can give you.
They had inside information.<eos> You must get pings like that every day.<eos> It's bigger than that.<eos> All three firms have links to Bobby Axelrod.<eos> This would be a big one.<eos> But a good matador doesn't try to kill a fresh bull.<eos> You wait until he's been stuck a few times.<eos> Why aren't you prosecuting the investment banks and hedge funds for insider trading?<eos> Go ask the 81 convicted felons of financial crimes currently serving time.<eos> But you have a very specific conflict of interest right in your own home.
Until we know at least as much as this fucking reporter knows, let's keep the brights on Steven Birch.<eos> All right.<eos> Get me every article Randy Kornbluth wrote in the past year.<eos> All of Mike Dimonda's articles, too.<eos> We'll start there.<eos> Mike.<eos> Good parlor trick, knowing my address.<eos> That'll look like a fun intimidation tactic when I write this up. Oh.<eos> You're not writing this up.<eos> Because that would be a small win, and you're not in it for small wins.
You know, I've, uh, I've been reading... Randy Kornbluth lately.<eos> He usually covers state politics.<eos> He hasn't had a hard business story in 18 months, but all of a sudden, he hooks into a full-blown crime story... On Steven Birch.<eos> His article quotes former federal prosecutor James Robbins, who says that the connection between hedge funds and company officials must be probed.<eos> You know who else likes quoting James Robbins?<eos> You.<eos> Seven times in the past six months.<eos> He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.
You.<eos> Seven times in the past six months.<eos> He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.<eos> If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?<eos> 'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.<eos> What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.

Yeah.<eos> I think long and hard before any prosecution in my office goes forward.<eos> And I'm proudest of the cases I choose not to prosecute.<eos> But when I go forward, it's full guns.<eos> I made one goddamn mistake.<eos> And who got hurt?<eos> No one.<eos> You could have let it go.<eos> You committed mail fraud.<eos> And you knew that my wife had died... Suddenly... And that I was desperate and lost.
I think you will.<eos> You've all seen the evidence we've gathered regarding your railroad trades.<eos> If we prevail at trial... which we're confident we will... The federal sentencing guidelines call for you to serve 11 years.<eos> We understand that you have young children.<eos> Well, maybe they'll be out of college by the time you're released.<eos> Maybe you can make it to their weddings.<eos> But like we told your lawyers, we're willing to forgo that for a quick plea... An admission of guilt, a forfeiture money judgment of $386 million.<eos> As well as the voluntary shuttering of your fund and conversion of it to a family office.<eos> You'll no longer handle any outside money.<eos> I can get the S.E.C. in here right now to do that if you don't agree.
I won't.<eos> Ellis Eads.<eos> We are honored to share this privilege with you, Mr. Axelrod.<eos> With you, too, Mrs. Axelrod.<eos> There's no sharing, Ellis.<eos> It's Axelrod Hall now. No.<eos> Of course. We understand.<eos> You think you do.<eos> Now, I saw that when I came in here, you don't remember me, Chad.<eos> I know who you are.
Take our kids with you<eos> I realise that the past couple of days have been difficult But those words offer little consolation<eos> Being trapped in the fjord at such a difficult time and with no help<eos> Goddamn it<eos> Why would he have done it?<eos> I can't think of a reason<eos> This isn't our only case<eos> OK.<eos> How about we go and arrest the captain?<eos> - Mr Carlsen. You're under arrest.
Do you have any idea what is going on in your little town?<eos> You think you had a murder or two, but, believe me, it's nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Who do you think murdered your mayor?<eos> - Are you telling us you know?<eos> - No.<eos> But I'm telling you this, that... burning someone alive is not normal, is it?<eos> Must have occurred to you what kind of people do a thing like that.<eos> What kind of people?<eos> You are afraid that if you talk to us someone will burn you alive.
Hello, Root.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> As you know, detective, witnesses involved in motor vehicle accidents often experience head trauma and as a result can present dramatically different version of events than the evidence suggests.<eos> Look, I know what you're thinking here, but I was there, and I'm telling you--<eos> Ballistics came back from the FBI lab.<eos> It was your weapon, detective.<eos> We believe the crash vehicle was one of Dominic's men attempting to spring him from custody.<eos> Dominic stole a guard's weapon, and when he tried to escape, you shot him.<eos> That's not how I remembered it--<eos> You stopped one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted from fleeing the scene.

I just had the urge to explain...<eos> Who we are and what we do.<eos> Or what I do.<eos> -How did she react?<eos> -Well...<eos> It turned out to be a really bad idea.<eos> She can't even bear it when I touch her.<eos> But she knows you're a soldier.<eos> I guess she's like the rest of Norway.<eos> It's easier to think about the war when you don't have to be involved.
-Negative.<eos> Let's take them out.<eos> Damn, it felt good to kill.<eos> Rasch, you stayed with these men in Afghanistan.<eos> Do you understand their behaviour?<eos> Yes, to a certain extent.<eos> They're in extreme situations.<eos> They lose their own soldiers, and that affects the psyche.<eos> It's important that the press is present to document it.<eos> What do you, as Defence Minister, think about this news?
Rasch has seen footage of soldiers who open fire without being subjected to any real threat.<eos> Is there any way to justify what is seemingly an execution?<eos> There's probably a military explanation.<eos> When young men are given guns, something happens to their psyche.<eos> One of the soldiers you were with in Afghanistan is joining us.<eos> -We'll let him get situated.<eos> -Just one second.<eos> -Jon Petter Hals, welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You were a soldier in the Special Armed Forces.

The Norwegian government's war policy.<eos> Please elaborate.<eos> Our warfare is symmetrical.<eos> In other words, our reaction should be equal to the threat.<eos> The patrol leader who chose to open fire, made the right decision.<eos> Rasch, do you recognize the threat the soldier mentions?<eos> I recognize what's in front of the camera.<eos> Behind it is a military assessment which I'm not qualified to make.<eos> I'm just making the footage public to discuss any ethical violations.<eos> You keep saying "ethical violations".
Whatever.<eos> Listen, Blackwell did kill someone. 12 years ago.<eos> Got drunk, ran a red light, hit another car, and killed the driver.<eos> But he did his time.<eos> He straightened himself out.<eos> But if we got his number...<eos> The Machine also gave us a Clearasil poster kid and a D-list actor, and we've still got more than two dozen to go here.<eos> Trust me on this one, Finch.<eos> He's keeping his head down, doing the best he can.<eos> We need more information before you can leave.
Please bear with us for a bit longer.<eos> Machine's got a circuit board loose.<eos> John, the Machine is unstuck in time.<eos> It can't tell past from present.<eos> That accounts for both your cases.<eos> We're working on the complication, but we just received a new number.<eos> Laurie Granger.<eos> Visiting the Big Apple from little Tulsa.<eos> That's 27 people remaining.<eos> Given the quality of our intel, you and Fusco should do some research and determine the order of triage.
Finch, that last number, yeah, they don't make hitwomen like her in Oklahoma.<eos> She has special forces training. She's the real thing.<eos> No military record, but an entire false digital life.<eos> Her fake credentials are excellent.<eos> She's got good tech backing her up.<eos> She could be a Samaritan operative.<eos> She found me at the precinct. She knows my cover ID.<eos> If I go back to the subway, I might be leading the enemy right to you.<eos> We'll deal with the Machine.<eos> You have to capture the assassin and find out who she works for.
Excuse me.<eos> Is this the New York Employment Center?<eos> I'm only finding day labor work.<eos> I need something permanent.<eos> We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.<eos> Well, it's got to be better than painting houses.<eos> Every other agency... they have an application to fill out.<eos> - A personality test.<eos> - No need.<eos> You have so much potential.
- Be cautious in your answers.<eos> - I intend to be.<eos> Otherwise, I think it's good that you're attempting to have a more normal life.<eos> That is, when you're not risking your life saving people.<eos> Or trying to stay a step ahead of an artificial superintelligence bent on world domination.<eos> Or that.<eos> Looks like most of the bugs have been worked out of Machine 2.0, given the steady stream of numbers that we've been getting.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> Alex Duncan, 25, single.<eos> Holds a master's degree in computer science. Works for an international consulting firm, and now you do too.
If Duncan is selling sensitive information, the threat could be a buyer looking to remain anonymous.<eos> Or Duncan himself, if he wants to cover his tracks.<eos> Whatever it is, Duncan's engaged in a dangerous game.<eos> - Mr. Duncan.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Step this way, please.<eos> Looks like someone's done playing.<eos> Just have a few questions for you, sir.<eos> - Mr. Duncan.<eos> - Who are you?
- This should cover it. - All right.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Why don't we take three steps to the left?<eos> Domain Awareness doesn't need to see this.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm on my lunch break, pal.<eos> Your son Lee is not half bad.<eos> His footwork's sloppy, but he's good with a stick.<eos> I know talent when I see it.<eos> I also know you're one of the last people to see Carl Elias alive.
I don't even know you.<eos> But you must've known Krupa.<eos> Here.<eos> I need to know if you hear from her.<eos> Okay, Garvin might be a good listener, but he's an even better stalker.<eos> Hold the phone, Finch.<eos> Think we just found our perp.<eos> He just broke into Krupa's apartment.<eos> Lower your weapon, nobody gets hurt.<eos> You were at the RTCC this morning.
And no one seems to give a damn.<eos> Unless you feel inspired, Detective.<eos> Mary Mulhall. She's Krupa's neighbor and classmate.<eos> I think she knows something but is too afraid to talk.<eos> I've hacked into ShotSeeker from here, Mr. Reese, and while I can't claim Mr. Garvin's sharp ears,<eos> I'm inclined to believe his case.<eos> He appears to have stumbled on a possible murder.<eos> Whoever shot Krupa may be targeting Garvin to scuttle his investigation.<eos> The best way to protect Ethan Garvin is to find out who's responsible for Krupa's disappearance.<eos> Why don't you and Mr. Garvin run down your first lead?
No.<eos> I need you here more than ever.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Locate New York plates KDD-0327.<eos> Mary must've told them something.<eos> I think your heart's in the right place, kid, but maybe you should leave the police work to the real police, so no one else gets hurt, huh?<eos> This is for your own good.<eos> Everywhere you go, a bullet seems to follow.<eos> J.D. Carrick from Harvesta.<eos> Are you responsible for this?
I'm with Bruce.<eos> He wants the truth.<eos> Won't take no for an answer.<eos> I understand.<eos> 30 minutes.<eos> I guess we can take Helper Monkey off the endangered species list.<eos> For now at least.<eos> Chin up, Harry.<eos> Our path to victory will reveal itself soon enough.<eos> Let's hope you're right.
Victim or perpetrator, if you stand in its way...<eos> We'll find you.<eos> Well?<eos> Mission failure again, sir.<eos> Aren't you tired, my dear Sameen?<eos> Why would I be?<eos> That's what, 7,053 times you've tried to get me to murder my friends?<eos> I meant tired of turning the gun on yourself.<eos> I've done worse.<eos> You're a smart girl.
Harry, I know you're worried about absolute power corrupting Her, about not being able to control Her.<eos> Not Her.<eos> Then who?<eos> Who's to say that with absolute power, we would be able to control ourselves?<eos> We can't know if we don't try.<eos> Did the Machine send you here to make this argument?<eos> No.<eos> Then why did you come all this way?<eos> I didn't like being alone in the subway.<eos> Oh, Ms. Groves, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself.
Rerouting radio signals into my cochlear implant is not an answer.<eos> I know it's dangerous with you know who listening, but what's the point of having an open artificial intelligence at your disposal if She's too afraid to talk to you directly?<eos> Harold and I got you back up and running.<eos> Now let's get back on track.<eos> We need to be actively looking for Shaw's exact location.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Miss Durov?<eos> Please forgive my impertinence.<eos> My name is Vasily.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that your performance today was... you are a revelation.
I'm... sorry we haven't been completely forthright.<eos> We... just didn't want you to get hurt.<eos> I think you need to get your eyes checked, Glasses.<eos> Where the hell do you think we are?<eos> If you're trying to protect me, it ain't working.<eos> I got a tunnel full of bodies that somebody tried to bury.<eos> What is it you guys aren't telling me?<eos> Please, go back to your job...<eos> This is my job.<eos> After everything that's happened, you and John still can't show me the respect, of telling me what the hell's going on.
Time to begin phase two.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Stewart.<eos> You have beautiful eyes and gray matter.<eos> If I was a zombie--<eos> A little humor to break the ice.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Do you remember the first time you realized there was something greater than yourself?<eos> Some people never experience this state of grace.<eos> Not everyone is meant to, but you merely have to ask, and we can show you the face of a god, or we can wipe your slate clean.
We'll start by asking you a few questions.<eos> Do you remember your name, your mission?<eos> What about the names of your Machine's acolytes?<eos> They've compressed the Machine to its core code, hiding it somewhere.<eos> Where would they go?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I think that chip fried her brain.<eos> There was a park you played in as a girl on the base in Qatar.<eos> The playground had a roundabout.<eos> The other kids loved to spin, but you got sick, so sick it made you angry.
Finch, Fusco's been shot.<eos> And Easton, or whoever the hell he is, he got away.<eos> Hi, you're probably wondering how I traced your call.<eos> I followed the detonation signal to your base of operations.<eos> Your encryption is impressive, along with that app on your phone that modulates your voice, but what's really ingenious is the call you made to yourself in the precinct.<eos> A recording that allowed you to assume the role of a victim.<eos> Even your getaway car, registered under another alias in a spot perfectly removed from street cameras.<eos> A precaution at every turn.<eos> Evidently not cautious enough.<eos> No, you've wreaked enough havoc.
Just have to take care of that errand first.<eos> Well, make it quick and don't miss that plane.<eos> I'll make it, sir.<eos> Between the SIM card switching and Ko's tight grip on whatever's in his briefcase,<eos> I don't like the looks of this, Finch.<eos> Stay close, Mr. Reese.<eos> Any new developments from the simulations, Harry?<eos> Unfortunately, it has yet to render a positive outcome.<eos> You mean the Machine's lost every hypothetical round to Samaritan.<eos> As you no doubt predicted.
Is there anything else the matter?<eos> We finally have open access to the Machine, and... now you're planning to close it.<eos> Go back to talking in numbers.<eos> Unless you've added telepathy to your long list of talents, there's no way that you could have known that I had chosen today to end our dialogue with the Machine.<eos> You built her to predict people, Harry.<eos> And she's very good at it.<eos> Starting with you.<eos> She respects your decision.<eos> She believes in you so much.<eos> You don't agree.
This won't take long.<eos> I should hope not.<eos> I won't give you the location of my friends or the Machine.<eos> So please, go ahead and kill me now before more people die.<eos> My dear Harold,<eos> Samaritan doesn't want you dead.<eos> So why has it gone to all this trouble to bring me here?<eos> Because Samaritan needs your help.<eos> Granted, Samaritan knows that you won't hear its appeal in your current state.<eos> One day, a day you may not be able to see now, you will work for Samaritan of your own accord.
Fort Meade?<eos> S'il vous plait.<eos> Merci bien.<eos> So what's this all about?<eos> Dozen bodies just turned up in that collapsed tunnel?<eos> I mean who called in the Feds?<eos> Well, the Chief of D's and the Commissioner's going nuts.<eos> They want answers.<eos> Care to share any evidence on this, Detective?<eos> I know about as much as you do.
Surely you're not that naive. You know another ASI would soon arise.<eos> Not for certain I don't, and neither do you.<eos> Proliferation is inevitable. - So is progress.<eos> - Progress?<eos> That eliminates free will and renders humanity irrelevant?<eos> Sir, there's been a security breach.<eos> We've got five men down.<eos> How many hostiles? Two.<eos> A man and a woman. A response team's been dispatched.<eos> You are the problem.
Let me get a look.<eos> Some peace and quiet, please.<eos> Here we go.<eos> And the door, if you will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Once you're inside the steel vault and surrounded by gold, reception gets tricky.<eos> Baby Samaritan hiding in plain sight.<eos> I can infect this copy with the same Ice-nine virus.<eos> Should only take me a moment.<eos> But you're gonna be busy.
There's one other thing.<eos> After Samaritan uploads its copy to the satellite, it's going to destroy the antenna so no one can reach it.<eos> Destroy it how?<eos> It set a course for a cruise missile.<eos> I'm afraid whoever uploads my copy won't make it back alive.<eos> I need you to gather all these weapons.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Reese.<eos> Finch, what are you doing?<eos> When I hired you, I suspected you were going to be a great employee.<eos> What I couldn't have anticipated was that you would become... Such a good friend.
I'm telling you, never seen anything like it.<eos> The man was a hero.<eos> Come on, John.<eos> It's time to go, sweetheart.<eos> Come on.<eos> And what I found was that the moment that often mattered the most, the moment when you truly found out who they were... Was often their last one.<eos> White House officials report last week's cyber attack that resulted in the erroneous launch of a naval cruise missile has been contained.<eos> We have reason to believe the attack was of Chinese origin.<eos> Good news, the majority of the nation's networks are fully operational.<eos> I hardly call that good news, Senator, and you know full well it wasn't the Chinese.
No, thanks, I do not drink.<eos> No thanks.<eos> You're probably wondering if I'm weird.<eos> I will immediately answer.<eos> I'm not weird.<eos> I'm not an occultist.<eos> I do not do black mässor<eos> I am so rational it may be, even boring.<eos> Look at me, Korben.<eos> I'm here because you too have begun to ponder.
Do you know where the word "skepticism" come from?<eos> From the Greek skeptikos, one investigating.<eos> -Who is he?<eos> Eva Saïd.<eos> Professor Ulé, specialist i metapsykologi.<eos> Meta-what?<eos> -Enc hette han visst. -<eos> Or vet, miss ...<eos> Your laughter just spread the room will in the future might be able to play inside -with the help of a device that captures distant echoes from before to -Like to find fossils in the ground.<eos> You are in a sense ...
We're all ghosts tomorrow.<eos> And we had a nice time!<eos> Forgive me, Professor.<eos> Continue.<eos> Who would have thought that one day it would be cameras- -As can reproduce a person's face, movements and voice?<eos> All the things that we take for Naturally you -framstod, before there was, like something out of a fool's fantasies.<eos> Tack.<eos> That only proves that none of us can predict the future.<eos> You probably did not succeed to convince Eve, but the last word is not said.<eos> You suffer when really of megalomania.
-A footstep.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Good night.<eos> Funny. I've never been in here.<eos> But that's fine.<eos> It is cozy and secure.<eos> And so you have a view of the garden and the plants ... You see people as well, but only the legs.<eos> What good you have it.<eos> Tack.<eos> Since you came into my life, everything has changed.
It is cozy and secure.<eos> And so you have a view of the garden and the plants ... You see people as well, but only the legs.<eos> What good you have it.<eos> Tack.<eos> Since you came into my life, everything has changed.<eos> It is an important meeting for me.<eos> And.<eos> It probably sounds terribly trite.<eos> No!<eos> It's as if you've opened a door I can close.
We have never been heard on the phone before, never been apart.<eos> It is as if I hear your voice for the first time.<eos> I know.<eos> It's a weird feeling.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -Professorn.<eos> -Reach?<eos> As a terrible confession.<eos> It is grief over your whole future life.<eos> "You've always wanted to try our best, his very best."
-I'm not. It's happening.<eos> We reserve the right to act when national security is at stake.<eos> Your editor knows.<eos> The Press Complaints Commission too.<eos> I've notified all editorial offices that derogation is in effect.<eos> We have a story about one of your Spec Ops, who killed someone in a car park in Oslo.<eos> It doesn't look good. But that doesn't mean...<eos> Allow me to be hypothetical:<eos> The Prime Minister is in secret talks with terrorists regarding a threat.<eos> You publish photos from this secret meeting.

-Do you have a stair glider for me?<eos> -No, but I can carry you.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Erling is in trouble.<eos> You have to deliver that thing.<eos> -I will.<eos> We sent a patrol to your house today.<eos> -Your wife said you were out for a run.
Erling is in trouble.<eos> You have to deliver that thing.<eos> -I will.<eos> We sent a patrol to your house today.<eos> -Your wife said you were out for a run.<eos> -That is correct.<eos> It must have been a long run.<eos> I ran down to Vippetangen at the port where I met my wife and son.<eos> Then I drove my son to the family farm, because I didn't want him to... Hear that his father is a murderer at school today.<eos> Did you kill Sharif Zamani? Yes.
Did you kill Sharif Zamani? Yes.<eos> Why didn't you turn yourself in at once?<eos> I'm afraid I'm not allowed to answer that.<eos> -Why?<eos> -I can't say.<eos> Surely, you're here to tell us something.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> But that piece of information is classified.<eos> I see.<eos> You're just back from Afghanistan.
What's your father's name?<eos> Gunnar Riiser.<eos> Riiser the jockey?<eos> He's an addict?<eos> He fell off his horse a few years ago.<eos> Yes, I remember that.<eos> It was a brutal fall.<eos> I talked to him earlier.<eos> I thought he was going into town to score. That's why I went there.<eos> Let's go back. You're at the Concert Hall.
He never went into town.<eos> I could have enjoyed the concert, but then we would have had a dead woman on our hands now.<eos> What happened to the woman?<eos> -I made sure she was treated.<eos> -Where?<eos> That's classified.<eos> We'll start on a formal charge sheet.<eos> You may wait here.<eos> You're summoned to a private press conference.<eos> You cannot give me an order.
He was with Willa, and...<eos> No, but you never should have left them alone!<eos> You're the oldest!<eos> You're in charge!<eos> Except when he's getting to third base with some slut.<eos> Like you'd ever know what that is, you freak of nature!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Turning on each other won't help anyone... Definitely not Adam.<eos> The first few hours of a missing-child case are critical, and if you spend them screaming at each other instead of remember what he was wearing, what he was doing, or who he was doing it with,<eos> You're the officer they sent?
Okay.<eos> We'll just be upstairs.<eos> If we're gonna have a shot at catching the guy who did this, I need to question Adam.<eos> It can wait till morning.<eos> The boy just got home.<eos> He knows that Adam's escaped.<eos> He could be on the move.<eos> Every second counts.<eos> I waited 10 years to get my son back.<eos> You can wait one night.
But her son will.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm John Warren.<eos> I'm...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Except that I'm...<eos> I'm sorry for what happened to you.<eos> You're sorry for what happened to me? Yes, I am.<eos> You happened to me.
Do you have family in the area?<eos> We need to contact them ASAP.<eos> Do you want these--<eos> No, no, no, don't touch.<eos> No touching.<eos> Okay.<eos> No touching.<eos> Can you tell me... how you got those scars?<eos> At least tell me your name.<eos> Who are you?
That's a very clever bumper sticker, Mrs. Winchell, but I'm going to remove your son from this school.<eos> Right.<eos> What was your first reason?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Why did you become a teacher?<eos> -This isn't about me.<eos> -But it is.<eos> It's about you and Steve, and the play, cast of two, setting, classroom, over many dimensions through time.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Maybe Steve can't learn because you lost track of your reason.

You lost someone.<eos> Someone important to you.<eos> I lost someone important to me, too.<eos> -Who'd you lose?<eos> -My patience if you don't stop.<eos> Was it your first love?<eos> Or a parent?<eos> Someone you loved young?<eos> A sibling?<eos> Look, you want to talk turkey?
The victim didn't report it because he feared reprisal.<eos> That boy has a lacerated trachea and is unable to sing at Nationals.<eos> So, I don't give a crap where the violence comes from and why.<eos> I don't want it in my school.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Sorry, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> This dimension is crumbling to violence and pettiness and greed, and Steve is sensitive enough to feel it and he's angry.<eos> He's angry and he's lost.<eos> And in order to find him, you'd have to teach yourself again, and you decided somewhere along the way that you were done learning.
Well, you should walk her in.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Poor henpecked Abel.<eos> Did Prairie leave a note?<eos> When she disappeared, was there any note?<eos> A note?<eos> No. What...?<eos> They're coming.<eos> Good to see you again, Mr. Johnson.<eos> You must be Mrs. Johnson.
- Okay, Steven?<eos> - Are you fucking insane?<eos> Just listen.<eos> You say they're molesting you.<eos> Then I'll back it up.<eos> 'Cause I'm just an onlooker.<eos> They beat the shit out of me in front of my own parents and they stood there like I'm some rabid dog.<eos> I know, Steven. I know. I know.<eos> Do you get the plan?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I say they're touching my dick and you come and get me.
Oh, my God!<eos> Which ones do you need?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> This one.<eos> And this one.<eos> Oh, sweet God! This man's wife is sick.<eos> And you two are gonna heal her.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Up the stairs.<eos> Move. - You don't understand.
This one.<eos> And this one.<eos> Oh, sweet God! This man's wife is sick.<eos> And you two are gonna heal her.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Up the stairs.<eos> Move. - You don't understand.<eos> - Slow. Hap, slow! - We're prisoners!<eos> - Let us out!<eos> - You don't understand!
Oh, I always confuse the two.<eos> Which, which one had the beard, Marx or Lenin?<eos> - Both! - Both.<eos> And the little beard.<eos> Let's go into the dining room, into the dining room, and then we'll have our meeting in there.<eos> - Okay. - Nice to meet you, very nice.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Oh, Ellie.<eos> Hi. Oh, these are my parents.<eos> Oh, Judy, yes, Judy. You must be Lou.
No, he's joking.<eos> Can I offer anyone an aperitif?<eos> - I'm your host. How are you? - How do you do?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Hello, nice to meet you.<eos> This is a fun group, I hope. Yes, yes.<eos> Kay?<eos> Kay!<eos> I could use a scotch.<eos> And, oh, and who are you?
- No, I'm not your patient.<eos> I'm a client and I'm not your patient.<eos> Are you never coming back in?<eos> The more we wait, the more we disagree.<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> I hope you all brought some paper and pens 'cause Rose is teaching us how to forge passports.<eos> Why do you need to learn how to forge passports?<eos> What on earth for?<eos> Are you the girl's mother? I am.<eos> How do you do? Judy. And you are?
I know, I know. I've never done that before.<eos> Have I seen you somewhere, huh?<eos> Me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You look familiar to me.<eos> Maybe you know me from my... maybe you read my book.<eos> You know me from my book jacket.<eos> Yeah, who are you?<eos> S. J. Muntzinger.<eos> You're S. J. Muntzinger?
You look familiar to me.<eos> Maybe you know me from my... maybe you read my book.<eos> You know me from my book jacket.<eos> Yeah, who are you?<eos> S. J. Muntzinger.<eos> You're S. J. Muntzinger?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The S. J. Muntzinger?<eos> Yeah, you know my books?<eos> My God, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're a genius!
Are they still out there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We are staying in here until they leave.<eos> Oh, yeah, because that's not going to look weird or anything.<eos> Can I use your phone to swipe left to get rid of the uglies?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> You wanted to speak with me?<eos> I heard you broke up with your boyfriend.<eos> I know that's probably why your grades have been slipping.<eos> That is so unbelievably creepy that you know that.
Well, I'm afraid it's a little late to make a return.<eos> - We were wondering if you knew where it came from.<eos> - That's of no consequence to either of you.<eos> I trust you've played the tape?<eos> - We have.<eos> - Then I suggest you play the game.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Where do we find the keys?<eos> - Only the game has the answers you seek.<eos> - You're insane.
Mm, we can figure it out out here.<eos> - Hmph.<eos> - I can take a guess who that is.<eos> - Margot.<eos> - Your powers of deduction serve you well.<eos> - Uh, that's it.<eos> I'm not risking her life over this.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Well, hello, fair maiden.<eos> - Yeah. Um, are you the owner of this place?
How are we not proper?<eos> - We have hats like you do! - Talk less!<eos> I'll consider it.<eos> No one knows this place.<eos> We'll hide here.<eos> I didn't badmouth you.<eos> They were talking that... the prisoner train was ambushed<eos> I know you have nothing to do with it<eos> I was just blending in with the crowd<eos> I didn't say you're one of them, I swear.
- Hey.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> She's right over here.<eos> You in charge?<eos> - Harper Deakins.<eos> - Angelo Becerra.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - Can we talk in private?<eos> I've been calling around about you.<eos> I'm sure you have better things to do than waste your time on me.
You in charge?<eos> - Harper Deakins.<eos> - Angelo Becerra.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - Can we talk in private?<eos> I've been calling around about you.<eos> I'm sure you have better things to do than waste your time on me.<eos> My thoughts precisely.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> Oh, they say you are giving the friends of Marty Stein a difficult time.
My thoughts precisely.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> Oh, they say you are giving the friends of Marty Stein a difficult time.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They did not say it so politely.<eos> Well, I appreciate you cleaning it up for me.<eos> I have a trade to offer you.<eos> - A trade?<eos> - You call off your dogs,
- Betsy.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> I don't know what crazy, stupid son of a bitch designs a remote with 700 buttons, not one of which says<eos> - "Watch TV."<eos> - Let me.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> We're here with Marty Stein, who says I'm not giving him a chance to answer why he killed Talia Freeman.<eos> We've all heard the recording, Marty.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause you're not acting like it.
Resync for WEB by CookiesMonsta Previously on Powers... Powers Division is a circus.<eos> Without help from other Powers, you're fucked.<eos> I call it a Drainer.<eos> It takes away their powers.<eos> You drain me, you drain yourself.
Green light comes on, power goes off.<eos> It's cool that you're Diamond and shit, but it's not like you're SuperShock.<eos> Or Retro Girl.<eos> She's only, like, a goddess.<eos> My dad would lose his shit, and my mom would stand in between me and him, and she would take as many punches as she could.<eos> She pretended to be you to make herself strong.<eos> You were a thing.<eos> Oh, my God, you hooked up with Retro Girl?<eos> You lost your powers and your head for me.<eos> I didn't want you because you had powers.
More questions, less answers.<eos> Welcome to my world, Detective.<eos> There is one more thing.<eos> One more thing?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hello, Lange.<eos> Hello, Schlag.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Actually, a big problem.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
Is he?<eos> Why? He says you insulted him with defamatory remarks.<eos> Perhaps, since my intention's always been to cause the worst harm on the President.<eos> You should write a book when you get out of prison called "Prison Poems," or something similar.<eos> That's an awful title, Alessandri.<eos> Don't talk about things you don't know.<eos> In politics, insolence is a way to look up to someone.<eos> I'm asking you to close the Pisagua concentration camp and to set my comrades free.<eos> Why ask me to do something I don't want to do?<eos> Because I thought you didn't take orders. Now I see you serve traitor Videla.
That and because you incited uprisings... by the union.<eos> I don't regret it.<eos> What do you regret?<eos> Becoming bourgeois? I regret I campaigned for the traitor.<eos> But you wrote him a poem.<eos> That's funny now, isn't it?<eos> But during the campaign...<eos> These traitors have their charm, too.<eos> I disagree.<eos> The things is that you and your comrades were so thirsty for power that you let yourselves be fooled by an overthrown populist.
A real country. With agriculture.<eos> -Good afternoon.<eos> -Good afternoon. -Passports, please.<eos> Here you go.<eos> According to this, your name is Ricardo Reyes Basoalto.<eos> My passport reads "Pablo Neruda."<eos> It reads "Reyes."<eos> That's because Neruda's his artistic name.<eos> That's my war name.<eos> If you have two names, I'm sorry but I can't let you leave the country.
No one tells me anything.<eos> Why? Perhaps they don't trust me because I'm not Chilean.<eos> Sure. I suggest we stay in touch. I might find something.<eos> Hold up.<eos> We've just heard Neruda's left Chile. Really?<eos> Yes, he's gone.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the borders are being watched by you.<eos> So, you think he's still in Chile.
The party made a decision. Yes, but that decision is up to you.<eos> Whether you accept it or not.<eos> And I did. Why don't you hear what he's saying?<eos> Ma'am, I know what to do with my life.<eos> They're all in jail but me.<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> What are you waiting for? Stay, then.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't stay here. I've got to get out.<eos> What you want is a great escape.
-Thank you.<eos> Walking around?<eos> -No. -What's that?<eos> It's an official arrest warrant issued by the National Police of Chile.<eos> No, no, but...<eos> No.<eos> I'm one of those people who might die first before going to jail.<eos> Where is he?<eos> -Not here. -Where?<eos> You don't get it, do you?
No.<eos> I'm one of those people who might die first before going to jail.<eos> Where is he?<eos> -Not here. -Where?<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You don't get a thing.<eos> What? In this fiction, we're all around the main character.<eos> -What?<eos> -Books, for example.<eos> This one. You've been reading it.
If you want, I could kill him.<eos> You wouldn't be able.<eos> -No.<eos> -Yes. -No.<eos> -Sure. He wrote all of this long ago.<eos> Have you ever seen a bored prisoner?<eos> On his mind, he's writing a fabulous novel.<eos> He's written about you. The tragic officer. He wrote about me, the absurd woman.<eos> He wrote about himself, the addict fugitive.<eos> What you... are saying... is modern bullshit.
Yup.<eos> I met Allen.<eos> Did you?<eos> I gave him marijuana.<eos> Oh, great, that's great.<eos> Can you believe that he's never tried it?<eos> What a sheltered life.<eos> Drugs, what does he need drugs for?<eos> Not drugs, grass, and don't worry, he's in his room trying it.<eos> I told him not to smoke it here or you'd have a cerebral hemorrhage.
- And this?<eos> - That's a blender.<eos> Yes, I have appliances.<eos> And what the hell is this?<eos> It's a hot fudge machine.<eos> Do you understand that... that people are starving?<eos> - For hot fudge? - No, you boob.<eos> Families can't feed their children the essentials of life.<eos> Here in America, do you know the malnutrition rate?<eos> And while kids are starving, you stand here and dick around - with waffles and hot fudge.

Stop kissing our house guest.<eos> I knew you were spying on me.<eos> I can spy on anyone I want.<eos> This is my house.<eos> What, does Allen need your permission to fall in love?<eos> Well, ahem, Allen is in love, and they're going to be married, and this is gonna be a triangle.<eos> Don't worry. I'm leaving soon.<eos> Hey, soon's not quick enough.<eos> Could you go a little earlier than soon?<eos> You know what? You're the type that, when the revolution comes, they're gonna put up against a wall and shoot.
- Thank you.<eos> - It's gonna be great.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> You're absolutely fine.<eos> Your heart's good.<eos> You may have a little indigestion, but that's all.<eos> And what about my lung?<eos> Well, the X-ray report I got is negative, so you see, you're really in good shape.<eos> I get the blood test back in a few days.<eos> Are you anticipating something?
Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Mr. Perales.<eos> Drew.<eos> Perales, please step down.<eos> Drew, what's wrong?<eos> Everything's wrong.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you?
Will Bowman?<eos> That's me.<eos> I'm Jennifer McMahon.<eos> Follow me.<eos> This is your ID.<eos> Wear it around your neck at all times.<eos> Had a badge before.<eos> Not like this one.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> So what are you, SWAT?
I volunteered.<eos> Yeah, when I was surrounded by Redhats I volunteered, too.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> If you're gonna work for me, you're gonna need to laugh once in a while. At least smile.<eos> Work for you?<eos> Wait, were you under the impression that you were going to be in charge here?<eos> Now, that's funny.<eos> Will Bowman.<eos> Almost as pretty as your picture.<eos> Who are you?

At least smile.<eos> Work for you?<eos> Wait, were you under the impression that you were going to be in charge here?<eos> Now, that's funny.<eos> Will Bowman.<eos> Almost as pretty as your picture.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Phyllis.<eos> Sit.<eos> And you run this place?
Does no one ever check you on this bullshit?<eos> I'm just saying, I would've made the same play.<eos> I think everyone knows why we're here.<eos> We're ready to listen.<eos> Well... we have you on the Pepsum trade.<eos> You know that. So why don't you tell us about how Bobby Axelrod funneled you and other satellites insider information?<eos> You're saying words I don't understand.<eos> - What he's saying is, at this time, he does not wish to cooperate.<eos> That's because he doesn't know what we have up our sleeve.<eos> Mr. Decker, approximately two and a half hours ago, we had someone sitting where you are now... a young man from a fund that I'm not at liberty to name, and he was downright chatty.
I'm not here for you. Take it easy.<eos> Ball two!<eos> It was nice that Karen and Bill come out to see their grandson play.<eos> It'll be a little awkward when we handcuff them - and haul them off.<eos> - Strike!<eos> Come on, Ted!<eos> Strike two!<eos> I don't know. That looked a little low to me.<eos> Anyway, we got a subpoena on your folks' investment portfolio and it seems that they were in on the Pepsum trade, among others.<eos> And I know and you know that was not a legal trade.
Perhaps hundreds of thousands.<eos> But it's strange.<eos> With more time and more lives saved, the potential for change is exponential.<eos> Yet here we are, on the same course.<eos> The people here have no idea what we did.<eos> No, for them nothing changed.<eos> This is their reality.<eos> Not ours.<eos> We are late arrivals.<eos> I had to investigate our own investigation. And as far as I can tell, only you, Mr. Ramse, and I are aware that anything is different.
An event altering your timeline? Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it got complicated.<eos> Cole, things are changing.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Go sit down.<eos> You have a purpose, Jennifer.<eos> You have a purpose, Jennifer.<eos> There is nothing more important than this.<eos> I need you to write a note in your journal.
I prefer this reality.<eos> So do I, Dr. Lasky.<eos> I will need your help, all of you, to fully understand this timeline.<eos> This will be all for now.<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> I need to have a word with you.<eos> Is there anything you wish to discuss, Dr. Eckland?<eos> You really don't remember me?<eos> I read through some part of my journal, and it looks like your expertise in molecular biology was quite valuable.<eos> I apologize, Dr. Eckland, but you were not part of my original reality.
Just like old times.<eos> Just like old times.<eos> Sam is here.<eos> Cassie threatened to hurt him.<eos> She wouldn't do that.<eos> You don't know her anymore.<eos> Everything's changed now.<eos> Let's go for a walk.<eos> When this mission began, you and I were both at a crossroads, neither sure if the other could be trusted.<eos> And you've always known more than me, and you've always held back.
A little.<eos> Cassie still sends the message.<eos> She still dies, only now, a few years later, along with billions of other people.<eos> I wouldn't call that a victory.<eos> What is that?<eos> Music, James.<eos> And more to the point, it's a broadcast.<eos> Shortwave.<eos> From somewhere out there.<eos> What you and Dr. Railly did in 2016 changed things.
I mean, y-you were just waiting for somebody to stop him, like Ike...<eos> - ...and you were just trying to preserve your own position.<eos> So, now I'm a dick 'cause I'm trying to win?<eos> - Yes. - Yeah.<eos> - You're the dick.<eos> - Yeah. You're the dick.<eos> The king.<eos> Who protects his flank?<eos> My client is getting hungry.<eos> You are.
No.<eos> Um, Mr. Jarvis, if you wouldn't mind slipping into something less athletic, I could use a ride to the office.<eos> There's work to be done, and I'm just getting started.<eos> Very well.<eos> So you haven't told her.<eos> Not yet, Rose.<eos> - Are you gonna tell her?<eos> - Yes, Rose. Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> It didn't really come up when we were chasing officer Icicle.<eos> Daniel, you're a nice guy.
Couple of things I ought to show you.<eos> This button here is in case you find yourself...<eos> Dehydrated.<eos> Howard Stark becomes more ridiculous the longer I know him.<eos> This button here adjusts the tints of the windows for extra privacy, there's a small compartment in the back with a change of clothes, and this is what Mr. Stark affectionately refers to as his...<eos> Sock on the doorknob.<eos> His what?<eos> It's a tracking device.<eos> Mr. Stark activates it when he's abandoned the car for the evening because he's found companionship.<eos> When I think Howard has reached the depths of depravity, you did up a wellspring, Mr. Jarvis.
I took a second job at the observatory scrubbing floors at night.<eos> Saved enough to get myself a degree.<eos> But it was the war that gave me a real opportunity...<eos> Navy engineer.<eos> And then some real, actual scientific work in the weapons propulsion lab.<eos> Seems to have paid off.<eos> I applied to 16 companies when I got home.<eos> Isodyne was the only one that was willing to put one of... my kind in a lab.<eos> So you can see why I didn't immediately jump at torpedoing my relationship with them.<eos> You're a good man, Dr. Wilkes, but protecting Isodyne betrays everything you've fought so hard to achieve.
Supervise the crime scene.<eos> I want you checking every blade of grass for evidence.<eos> On my way.<eos> Baxter, go shake down the Dunbar.<eos> I want a statement from every person that set foot in that place.<eos> On it.<eos> Rose... get on the horn with local precincts.<eos> Put an APB for Jason Wilkes.<eos> I want every badge in this city looking for him.<eos> Jarvis, you're coming with me.
Excuse me.<eos> You don't have clearance to be here.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> You'll have to sign this.<eos> You really shouldn't be here.<eos> I-it's not safe.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Now, you're going to place the specimen in that case, and you're going to give it to me.

Excuse me?<eos> Now, you're going to place the specimen in that case, and you're going to give it to me.<eos> Miss Frost, you have no idea what this stuff is capable of.<eos> Oh, on the contrary, I am the only person who knows what it's capable of.<eos> Now hand it over.<eos> Miss Frost, you're making a terrible mistake.<eos> I can't in good conscience let you go through with it.<eos> So you're willing to die for this crisis of conscience?<eos> I'm starting to think that was your plan for me no matter what.<eos> I'm also starting to think that you're smart enough not to shoot me while I'm holding this.
He di... He didn't make it.<eos> The explo... explosion.<eos> Okay. We're done here.<eos> How about you get some rest?<eos> Th-there's still so much to process.<eos> Peggy...<eos> You're going home.<eos> Okay?<eos> Miss Carter...<eos> I'm immensely relieved that you're unharmed.
I'll do that on the plane to Peru.<eos> Uh, you're what the where now?<eos> Peru.<eos> The country.<eos> Jason and I realized we need an expert in subatomic and gravitational physics.<eos> And there's no greater expert in the world than my old professor, Abner Brody.<eos> Unfortunately, he took his brain with him when he relocated to the Amazon last year.<eos> I've heard of Brody.<eos> There's no one better.<eos> You crunch the math.
Are you mad?<eos> Someone tried to kill me, and now they're trying to kill you.<eos> I'm removing myself from the equation before anyone gets hurt.<eos> If you remove yourself from the people trying to protect you, you're as good as dead.<eos> Do you think you would've made it out of the Griffith Park Observatory without me?<eos> I can hold my own.<eos> Oh, don't be a ninny.<eos> You need us.<eos> And we need you.<eos> If Whitney Frost is an expert on zero matter, as she claims, you're our best asset against her.
They want to replace you.<eos> They're looking for a fresh face.<eos> Someone younger?<eos> I-I told them I would walk if they fired you.<eos> I told them nobody treats my star that way.<eos> They folded.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're my girl.
I need names of members, I need to know what they're up to, and I want to know how Whitney Frost figures into all this.<eos> Club policy says I ain't allowed to socialize with the members or their wives.<eos> You really want to do this the hard way?<eos> Did you get that leg in combat?<eos> Bastogne.<eos> Europe.<eos> Cute.<eos> Look, you gonna smack me around or break a couple fingers?<eos> Have at it.<eos> Because while you were playing grab-ass on the continent, I was already playing this game with the Japanese.
They're being tasked to train field agents in irregular warfare... Espionage, sabotage, guerrilla tactics.<eos> Field work?<eos> But they don't send women into the field.<eos> Resistance networks all over Europe need people who won't draw attention walking down the street.<eos> They need women.<eos> And they're recruiting you.<eos> Why?<eos> That is...<eos> Why me?<eos> Well, you're already an exceptional codebreaker, Miss Carter.
And they're recruiting you.<eos> Why?<eos> That is...<eos> Why me?<eos> Well, you're already an exceptional codebreaker, Miss Carter.<eos> Someone must see a great deal of potential in you.<eos> It's quite an honor to be tapped.<eos> Yes... I see.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards. I don't believe I'm meant to be in the field.<eos> This is a rare chance for you to strike a massive blow for King and Country.
The War Department has decided to audit this branch's cases, past and present.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> Peggy...<eos> It's an executive order.<eos> Comes straight from D.C.<eos> So, if you'll just crack open your files, we'll get to work, and I'm sure this will all be done in no time.<eos> Chief, would you mind showing my men around?<eos> Guys.<eos> After you.<eos> And you... must be the Agent Carter that I keep hearing so much about.
We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance.<eos> There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.<eos> He says that you're quite the independent thinker.<eos> I'm sure he meant that as an insult.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Times like these, it's often safer to be seen as a team player.<eos> But you... don't seem like the type of lady who plays anything safe.
She wanted names.<eos> And you gave them to her?<eos> We hired you because you said you couldn't be broken.<eos> And this is what you have to show for it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not taking the fall for this.<eos> You're gonna have to answer to the Council yourself.<eos> See, I think that's where you're wrong.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna protect me.
Or maybe... even an actress in one of those pictures.<eos> What do you think?<eos> That sounds real interesting.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Agnes.<eos> Agnes Cully.<eos> Well, that'll have to change.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you need a name as pretty as you are.
I was thinking more of a crash course.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> - I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> - So sweet, but...<eos> No. Terrible idea.<eos> After the war, I had 11 job offers. 11.<eos> I went with the SSR because I was told I had an opportunity to use my expertise in field operations.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> You did, chief Sousa.
Doesn't sound like my kind of picture.<eos> I'm more interested in your new beau.<eos> Hi, handsome.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Don't talk to her.<eos> Aren't you protective?<eos> Don't be shy, little puppy.<eos> Come on over here. Join us.<eos> Keep focus here.<eos> You'll be obtaining a blood sample from Miss Frost, and you will do so without being detected.
This Carter woman is disobeying your direct orders.<eos> Now, if you want to impress the people in this room, climb the only ladder that counts, you can't let a-a female subordinate make an ass out of you like this.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I have pulled the fox back out of the henhouse.<eos> Every second we remain here puts us in more peril.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, you have a valid reason to be in attendance.<eos> You need to keep Thompson occupied while Dottie retrieves the sample.<eos> You think you can handle that, Underwood?<eos> I don't know. It's such a complicated plan.<eos> Miss Underwood, you... are a nuisance.
Sitting by Mr. Stark's swimming pool, reading a rather bawdy pulp novel last time I saw her.<eos> I find that hard to believe.<eos> And why's that?<eos> Because she wouldn't miss an opportunity to ruin this evening for Calvin Chadwick.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me, I have a sudden urge to go secure the perimeter.<eos> Are you sure it's wise to... To cause such an uproar at your employer's party?<eos> My employer?<eos> Yes. Mr. Chadwick.<eos> He's always looking out for ambitious men like yourself to do his bidding.<eos> You're just his type.
I'm chief in the New York SSR.<eos> I serve the federal government.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> My mistake.<eos> When he's elected senator, Chadwick and I will work together... To protect this country.<eos> Well, I find that hard to believe.<eos> Thanks for the input.<eos> I'll be sure to forget it as soon as you're out of my sight.<eos> One final word of advice.<eos> I know you fancy yourself a political animal, but you are decidedly out of your depth, Chief Thompson...
I know. Please.<eos> No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> I made you.<eos> Please.<eos> I'd like to call this meeting to order.<eos> Any objections?<eos> Mr. Jones, I need unrestricted access to all Roxxon facilities.<eos> Um... yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm also gonna need you to speak to Vernon masters, bring him up to speed on this administrative overhaul.
No. Oh.<eos> The wife of a Nazi concentration-camp commander.<eos> She... liked to kill prisoners and skin the tattoos off their bodies as a souvenir.<eos> Charming.<eos> I interrogated her after she was captured.<eos> In less than 24 hours, she told me everything I wanted to know.<eos> And this was an especially persuasive tool.<eos> I've pulled out my own teeth... My own nails... My own hair.<eos> I've burned my own flesh with a blowtorch.<eos> I'm no Nazi harlot. And you are wasting my time.
Aren't you sweet.<eos> Not as smart as you think you are, though.<eos> ♪ Dr. Fennhoff... He certainly got your goat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I read all about that fiasco.<eos> Tricked into helping a crazy, old Russian with his revenge fantasy against Howard Stark.<eos> Huge embarrassment to Leviathan.<eos> And Stalin?<eos> Well, he's not exactly the forgiving type.<eos> You know nothing about it.
I promise you, no harm will come to me under Miss Carter's watch.<eos> Don't make promises you can't keep.<eos> Ready, Mr. Jarvis?<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> Let's see what Miss Frost has planned for us.<eos> Let me get this straight. You're telling me Roxxon has known about this heist for the past 48 hours. They're just now coming to us?<eos> Trail is ice-cold.<eos> - I agree with you.<eos> Whoever pulled off this job is talented.<eos> But I believe that you are smarter than they are.
I may have overheard a private utterance or two.<eos> If you are implying that I am some sort of chippy toying with two men that I respect, you...<eos> The thought never crossed my mind.<eos> However... You have rather gone from famine to feast, vis-? vis quality suitors.<eos> And I must say, I do not envy your position.<eos> Between Dr. Wilkes' incandescent smile and Chief Sousa's eyes, so warm yet so wise...<eos> No. No, no.<eos> Please, please.<eos> No!<eos> I never intended to encourage the affections of two... Quality suitors, as you say.
4, 3, 2...<eos> Wonderful!<eos> Enjoy the Poinsettia Garden outside the east wing and have a very pleasant day.<eos> Frost: Isometric heat-waste regulators.<eos> Oh, kinetic force stabilization.<eos> Mobile solar energy collectors...<eos> What, is he constructing a palladium core?<eos> The man's a certifiable genius.<eos> He wants to waste it on making movies. What a shame.<eos> What are you doing here?
Frost: Isometric heat-waste regulators.<eos> Oh, kinetic force stabilization.<eos> Mobile solar energy collectors...<eos> What, is he constructing a palladium core?<eos> The man's a certifiable genius.<eos> He wants to waste it on making movies. What a shame.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Dr. Wilkes. The last time we saw each other... That was quite an evening, wasn't it?<eos> I'm impressed. To design all this by yourself...<eos> You are very special, Dr. Wilkes.
A colored scientist.<eos> I done seen everything.<eos> Watch your mouth.<eos> Dr. Wilkes, meet my associate, Joseph Manfredi.<eos> You get what you need, sweetheart?<eos> Not everything.<eos> Dr. Wilkes will be accompanying us.<eos> No. No, I won't.<eos> No offense, doc... But I wouldn't take that tone with me.<eos> If you think...
Nonna, nonna, no.<eos> Nonna...<eos> Let go.<eos> Give us a moment, please.<eos> What message would you like me to deliver to Miss Frost?<eos> What do you think of my research?<eos> Think you're a mass murderer of rats.<eos> My experiments, Dr. Wilkes...<eos> Though rudimentary, they have produced results.<eos> I know how to control this, and I think you can, too.
Doctor, I want to thank you and your staff for everything that you've done for us.<eos> Uh, when do you think we might be able to go home?<eos> As you know, the surgery was very difficult.<eos> There was a great deal of internal damage.<eos> We almost lost her several times.<eos> Yes, but y-you said that the surgery was successful.<eos> And on the whole, it was.<eos> We saved her life.<eos> But there were some complications, some damage we couldn't fully repair.<eos> I don't know if you and your wife had ever planned on having children...
She's still the hospital until she regains her strength.<eos> I came to get her cashmere throw. What are you doing?<eos> We're going to get Wilkes, then we're going to get Whitney.<eos> How?<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> You can go back to your wife knowing full well that I will make this right.<eos> How?<eos> Mr. Jarvis, I understand that you have a great deal invested into the outcome of this mission.<eos> Indeed. Whitney Frost shot my wife. I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.
Hi.<eos> A-apple torte?<eos> I-I hear it's your favorite.<eos> Where's Mr. Jarvis?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Rose.<eos> I work with Peg.<eos> Mr. Jarvis said he'll be back shortly and that I should keep you company until he gets back.<eos> I understand that you like to play hangman.<eos> You guess first.
Against the wall.<eos> We're looking for Marla Nelson.<eos> - Room 201.<eos> - Class, we talked about--<eos> - Stay seated-- sit down!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> Why?<eos> What for?<eos> You know what for.
Remain in line at all times and proceed through the gate when instructed.<eos> Let's go, grab a bag.<eos> Move along.<eos> You-- next. Come on.<eos> Lucky day. Administrative pull for you.<eos> I'm happy to meet you.<eos> I wish it were under better circumstances, of course.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I understand.<eos> I want to assure you that you and your family are going to be perfectly safe from now on.
Folding laundry.<eos> And then?<eos> I heard a crash in the living room, I ran down the stairs, I saw the fire, I grabbed the fire extinguisher.<eos> You keep one in the house?<eos> Yeah, under the sink.<eos> And the attacker-- what did he look like?<eos> He was dressed all in black with a mask over his face.<eos> But you did see him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So this attacker throws a bomb into your house and waits for you to run all the way downstairs and grab the fire extinguisher and then lets you get a look at him?
Uh, he came into my bar in New Orleans.<eos> When he was still a Ranger stationed at Fort Benning.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, Will joins the FBI, and you move four times, and you wind up here in LA.<eos> Don't you miss the South?<eos> It's why I opened the Yonk.<eos> That must have caused some stress in your marriage.<eos> Sorry-- what does any of this have to do with finding who fire-bombed my house?<eos> Will's in the FBI.<eos> You're running a bar... not to mention that you're a very attractive woman.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Will reminds me so much of that.<eos> He's a tremendous professional.<eos> He's smart.<eos> He's competent, driven, funny... and so in love with his wife that... he doesn't see her for what she is.<eos> Was that the first time that you'd seen someone die?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside.
He's a remarkable man, Lady Churchill.<eos> That's why he's making progress.<eos> He is brave, yes, but this is not a cavalry charge or a desert.<eos> This is age itself he's up against.<eos> He needs hope.<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> Hope is what makes the difference.<eos> Millie... my husband's ambition runs people over and it comes at a cost. Often to those closest to him.<eos> If he fails and gets low, as only he can it will not be you who has to pick him up.<eos> You'll be in Australia with your young man.
Previously on "Agent Carter"...<eos> Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.
Leaving Dottie with Whitney Frost would've been tantamount to murder, and unlike you, I'm not a murderer, Mr. Jarvis!<eos> And yet everyone around you dies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... I know I shouldn't have said that.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> You have begged me to bring you on my adventures since I arrived in Los Angeles, and that's what they are to you...<eos> Larks, an enjoyable way to spend the evening.<eos> And then you go home to another man's mansion, listening to your radio shows, blissful in your self-imposed ignorance.<eos> And when there is a consequence... A horrid, ugly consequence... You blame me for the choices that you have made.
I'll be keeping you two company this time around.<eos> Aww, crap.<eos> "Oh, crap," indeed.<eos> Sip wisely.<eos> You can follow the sun to the beach.<eos> Thanks for the motor.<eos> What's your plan, Miss Carter?<eos> Where do we go next?<eos> I don't think we'll catch Whitney Frost...<eos> No, Mr. Jarvis, you need to be with your wife.
You have to take me out of here, back to the desert, an-anywhere isolated.<eos> Oh, I think we're a little past that point, don't you?<eos> I'm not safe.<eos> I can't hold on.<eos> I can't fight it much longer.<eos> You don't have to fight it.<eos> Do you realize how ungrateful you sound?<eos> Others would kill for zero matter.<eos> Some people have killed for it.<eos> - And you just want to stuff it down?
Some people have killed for it.<eos> - And you just want to stuff it down?<eos> - I need to get rid of it.<eos> That is what I'm attempting to do, is take it from you.<eos> I do feel as though I should apologize for what's about to happen.<eos> But you and I both know that pain is often the harbinger of progress.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Ah, Agent Carter.<eos> You are one resilient...
Maybe you should give him a rest.<eos> You mess with someone this long, his heart's gonna give out before you get what you need.<eos> I'm not shaking him down for cash, Joseph.<eos> I'm just saying, the guy's been put through the ringer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Kill the machine.<eos> I am at my wit's end with you, doctor.<eos> Scalpels, needles...<eos> Nothing pulls this out of you, and I know you could give it to me if you choose.
Too many things can go wrong, not least of which Vernon masters turning against us all.<eos> The one thing I know we can count on is Vernon doing what's best for Vernon.<eos> And right now, that's getting rid of Whitney Frost.<eos> Carter to Thompson.<eos> Jack, can you hear me?<eos> Damn it.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Fuel line's cut.<eos> Vernon.<eos> So I look him dead in his eye, and I say, "I don't give a damn if you're Vernon Masters or Harry Truman or Tarzan of the Apes.
- 8:30.<eos> It's too early.<eos> Uh, I have lost the, uh, residing of my residence.<eos> - And, um...<eos> - He got evicted.<eos> What is, uh, this?<eos> - I'm his friend.<eos> - She's my associate.<eos> Associate only.<eos> Anyway, you can't...
Think about wich one you want to drink.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can do this.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Now that you mentioned Costco, what if I told you you could save, um...<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, what if I... you had the kind of membership that could take...
I daydream<eos> Sir.<eos> You're going to have to move your car. This is church parking only.<eos> - Yeah, I'm in church.<eos> - No, you're in a car.<eos> And it's a smoke-free zone anyway.<eos> I'm in the middle of something, okay?<eos> Can you just give me a minute?<eos> If you don't move your car, I'm going to have it towed.<eos> I'm going to have you towed. I'm serious, sir.
- Uh, sure. Thanks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> Yeah, she's just not having a good time, so...<eos> No problem.<eos> No, it happens all the time.<eos> - And I guess...<eos> - No, you don't have to bring...<eos> - You sure?<eos> - You can bring it if you want.
Do you have any rope?<eos> Oh, or a Bible.<eos> We could use it as bait for a trap.<eos> Hey, Debbie Doughnut, I did my eye makeup like you!<eos> Now we both look like we had a bad high school experience.<eos> If you're not gonna pierce your clit, stop trying to relate to me.<eos> Ms. Watson, you are aware that your class must be emptied by 3:00 p.m.<eos> Yup, and my bladder needs to be emptied by the end of now.<eos> Don't worry, I was just helping Caroline clean up.<eos> You don't help people.
Participation?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's rare.<eos> The only way I can describe it is if you've seen "Good Will Hunting."<eos> I haven't seen it.<eos> Then I can't describe it.<eos> So are we good here?<eos> I guess so?<eos> Gotta see "Good Will Hunting."<eos> Lucy's Matt Damon, and I'm Robin Williams, and you'd be the foster father that beats up his back real bad and scars it up all nasty like.
Ooh, I smell conflict.<eos> This would be an excellent opportunity to, as we say in reality speak,<eos> "stir the pot."<eos> Vern!<eos> Maddie's mom is here and she is pissed.<eos> Just play along, okay?<eos> Cynthia?<eos> - Charlotte!<eos> - Do you know where Maddie is?<eos> You must be Maddie's mom.
This design is a machine that connects the two.<eos> If she weren't a homicidal maniac, I'd be in love.<eos> It'll work, but there are issues.<eos> For example, how do we prevent even more Zero Matter from coming out?<eos> Not to mention the risk.<eos> If we lose control of it, we've only succeeded in giving Whitney Frost the means to bring about the end of the world.<eos> Well, I'd like to postpone Armageddon if we can help it.<eos> Yes, there are many obstacles, but I'm standing in front of three of the most radiant minds on the planet.<eos> Surely, you can find a way to overcome them.<eos> I believe you can actually hear the sound of their egos growing.
As many as we've got.<eos> How is Ana feeling?<eos> Very well.<eos> Although she's climbing the proverbial walls to be released.<eos> Doctor says she can come home in a day or two.<eos> Well, that's good news.<eos> We had a good cry over what can never be.<eos> She's her usual... optimistic, lovely self.<eos> And far stronger than I could ever be.<eos> You sell yourself short, Mr. Jarvis.
We did have one dance.<eos> Half a dance.<eos> I suppose that's better than nothing.<eos> Welcome home. I'm... I'm so glad I didn't miss you.<eos> Miss Carter.<eos> You were going to leave without saying goodbye?<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> - Well, I... - Raised in a barn, my granny would say.<eos> Um, I... I didn't want to bother you and, um...<eos> I thought perhaps you might... might not want to see me.
Let English men fight English wars, thank you sir.<eos> No conscription for Ireland.<eos> Nice to be home though.<eos> Hello.<eos> Fancy a fuck fellows?<eos> I would but I'm a family man.<eos> No conscription for Ireland.<eos> You should be fighting for your own country.<eos> That's what we're doing, fighting for our King and country.<eos> No you're a traitor.
Are we going out on manoeuvres Sir?<eos> Soon Cormac, manoeuvres from which not all of us will return.<eos> Like Cu Chulainn, we'll welcome death in battle as a glorious thing.<eos> And God grant we'll all live in eternal glory like him.<eos> Right lads guns to infirmary and take as much ammunition as you can hide about yourselves.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> This is an empire Hammond, its fate does not hang upon the word of a schoolboy or the fantasies of some crack brain school master.<eos> I will not bother the cabinet with rumour and innuendo.<eos> Yes, Sir Matthew.<eos> Do you and Mrs. Hammond have plans for the Easter weekend?
If I did, I'd still be here.<eos> You have to go.<eos> What you told me about yourself... don't tell anyone else.<eos> You're up early, Inspector.<eos> The transmitter's right in the village.<eos> If he doesn't signal tonight, we'll go in and search.<eos> But that's not why I'm here.<eos> The old man is getting a visit tomorrow, from the head of the SS.<eos> - Himmler's coming here?<eos> - You catch on quick.
- For now.<eos> - You look happy.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Here am I, a butcher's son from Munich, tearing the Kaiser's palace upside down.<eos> That is what National Socialism has done for Germany.<eos> Staff files from von Ilsemann.<eos> - What do you think of him?<eos> - He's harmless.<eos> - I don't like him.<eos> - You don't like anyone.
- Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I mean, with all your setbacks and your issues, you... you live your life with such a... joie de vivre.<eos> You're right, I do.<eos> I do have a lot of joie de vivre. You do.<eos> You really do, and it's unusual to see that in a teacher.<eos> I mean, it's unusual to see it in anybody.<eos> I really hope you find what you're looking for.<eos> Thank you, Principal Toby.<eos> And for the record, I think you're a lot funkier than people give you credit for.
Previously on "Nashville"... I'll see you when I see you.<eos> Well, I told you we were casual.<eos> Might be time for you'll to sign at Highway 65.<eos> With one condition... That you do it together.<eos> Mr. Wheeler, you owe the government $40 million.
Hey, I'm sorry. We're, uh...<eos> We're not quite open yet here.<eos> Well, I-I know. I-I was just hoping to get on the list for your open mike tonight.<eos> Well, then, I'm sorry again.<eos> That list is full. Maybe come back next week, all right?<eos> Well, I'll probably be back on the road by then.<eos> Um... and playing in Nashville's always sort of been a dream of mine, you know?<eos> Well, there's about 50 other bars that got an open Mike...<eos> Yeah, but there aren't 50 other bar owners who actually make their own music.<eos> I mean, you're Deacon claybourne.
I don't know what I can tell you, Ms. Jaymes.<eos> The investigation is ongoing.<eos> Do we have any information on where Vita might be?<eos> Are there any suspects?<eos> Look, I appreciate your interest, but at this point, we don't even know if there was a crime.<eos> What?<eos> Her car was burned out. Her guitar, everything was destroyed.<eos> But there was no blood, no witnesses, no hard evidence, which means we have to look at all the possibilities, and that takes time.<eos> So, please, Ms. Jaymes, allow us to complete our investigation.<eos> There's nothing more you can do, okay?
Is it true you once choked out Coleman Carlisle in an alcoholic rage?<eos> May I remind you you are under oath?<eos> Did you attack Coleman Carlisle in an alcoholic rage?<eos> Mr. Claybourne.<eos> Yes.<eos> And is it true you got into yet another altercation punching a man in the parking lot of the Bluebird?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it true you were involved in a drunk-driving accident that took the life of your friend Vince Jamison?<eos> Yes.<eos> And is it true that you were the cause of a car accident that almost took the life of Maddie's mother, your wife, Rayna Jaymes?
So, what are you two these days?<eos> Oh... nothing much. Somewhere between exes and friends, I guess?<eos> Oh, it's too bad.<eos> I always thought y'all were, um, pretty great together, both personally and musically. In my experience, that doesn't happen too often.<eos> You talking about Rayna?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Actually, I was, uh, talking about my ex-wife.<eos> Okay, I think we've all heard enough.<eos> Can you shut them up, please? Sorry.<eos> Who are you?
Ohhh. You excited to get out there and play tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I'm a bit nervous.<eos> Well, we'll all be together.<eos> Not all of us.<eos> It's an attack not only on religious liberty, but on all the heterosexual citizens of this country.<eos> Oh, me singing songs does all that?<eos> Oh, activist lawmakers will see to it that we are found guilty of a hate crime for rejecting a lifestyle that is historically... I mean, biblically and physically is just wrong.<eos> You brainwash our youth, you pervert our laws in order to destroy the sanctity of marriage!<eos> You're scared, aren't you?
Excuse me?<eos> That's why you didn't want me on your show. That's...<eos> - That's why you won't let me speak now.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I don't know what you're trying to get at here,<eos> - but this really...<eos> - If you're not afraid, then let me speak.<eos> Fine.<eos> Speak.<eos> You don't want your audience to see me or hear me.
They live over there.<eos> Over there?<eos> Hey, boys, in!<eos> Police, Mrs. Brufort.<eos> I am looking for your husband.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I met him this morning.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Do you live here, then?
Yes, the van Peteghems are always "a force that goes"!<eos> - And that's what you are!<eos> - Definitely.<eos> You are a force that goes!<eos> Victor Hugo's words!<eos> - A force of life!<eos> - A force of life... yes... that goes!<eos> In any case, you were most admirable!<eos> It was a difficult investigation, Mr. van Peteghem.<eos> And you knew how to handle it!
It says that you used your connections to get your boyfriend off on a cocaine charge.<eos> - It's a bullshit charge.<eos> - There's gonna be an investigation.<eos> Until then, you're on administrative leave.<eos> Where is Gary Keyes, Mr. Kelly?<eos> I've told you, I don't know.<eos> Keep selling me that same horseshit, we're gonna be at this all day.<eos> Is that supposed to make me change my answers?<eos> I'm telling you, that's all I know.<eos> Because if you're into something, Jen...
She didn't need your shitty exam.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What are you going to do with your life?<eos> Like everyone.<eos> This isn't a gig!<eos> That's what I'm talking about, making money.<eos> You see many millionaire receptionists?<eos> Some do very well.<eos> They're not millionaires.<eos> Neither are you.
Neither are you.<eos> Can't you see I'm trying to help you?<eos> Help us do what?<eos> Become society's flunkeys?<eos> Rules are necessary.<eos> But you're too stubborn.<eos> You don't want to learn.<eos> So you'll never achieve anything in your life.<eos> Go and sit down.<eos> What have you achieved?
Of course, the SEC will want unfettered access to our books.<eos> Any irregularities are sure to come out.<eos> You didn't really think we wouldn't find out?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You think there's a trick you can pull we haven't tried?<eos> This is amateur.<eos> Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?<eos> You ever have a 12-inch black dick in your ass?<eos> Prison, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> You're in a lot of trouble.
This is amateur.<eos> Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?<eos> You ever have a 12-inch black dick in your ass?<eos> Prison, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> You're in a lot of trouble.<eos> If that were the case, you would have already turned me in.<eos> So, my guess is the SEC is after someone a little more senior.<eos> Someone on the board, perhaps.<eos> Or someone who's clearly unstable.<eos> We'd like you to go to Switzerland and bring Mr. Pembroke back to us.
That's only nine.<eos> Absolution.<eos> Yes!<eos> You like puzzles?<eos> Not really.<eos> You mind?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe the reception nurse explained... that visiting hours end at 3:00 p.m. precisely.<eos> She did.<eos> But as I'm sure you're aware...
But as I'm sure you're aware...<eos> Mr. Pembroke remains the CEO of a major financial institution.<eos> Under the circumstances, I was hoping you can make an... exception.<eos> Vitamins.<eos> If we are to help the people that come here... we must keep up our strength.<eos> May one ask what it is concerning?<eos> It's a business matter.<eos> I'm not at liberty to say any more than that.<eos> Of course.<eos> And I hope you understand that we also have our rules.
Terrible thing, though.<eos> Such violence.<eos> That's what you get for marrying your sister.<eos> Sister?<eos> Yeah, it was all about a pure bloodline, wasn't it?<eos> How fascinating!<eos> I must look into that.<eos> Glad to see you're back on your feet!<eos> We heard about the accident.<eos> You're American, aren't you, Mister...
Not really.<eos> That song you were singing.<eos> Where did you learn that?<eos> I have to go now.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Hannah.<eos> Mr. Pembroke?<eos> Where's Pembroke?<eos> The patient that was in this room, where is he?<eos> I thought you were Pembroke.
Mr. Lockhart... please, won't you join us?<eos> The sturgeon is excellent, unless of course you prefer the venison.<eos> I couldn't let it go to waste.<eos> Where's Pembroke?<eos> Mr. Pembroke has unfortunately taken a turn for the worse.<eos> I fear your conversation about business matters... has set him back somewhat.<eos> But, no matter.<eos> We have moved him on to the next stage of treatment.<eos> He looked all right to me.<eos> But you're not a doctor.
Is that right?<eos> Tell me, Mr. Lockhart... when was the last time that you actually felt well?<eos> Before you came here, when was the last time... that you even slept through the night?<eos> The mind may lie... but the body cannot.<eos> I should like to help you.<eos> What we offer here... is a simple process of purification.<eos> Away from pressures of the modern world.<eos> A return to a simpler time.<eos> Mr. Pembroke will not be ready to travel for a day or two.<eos> And if you're willing... I would like to recommend a treatment.
Away from pressures of the modern world.<eos> A return to a simpler time.<eos> Mr. Pembroke will not be ready to travel for a day or two.<eos> And if you're willing... I would like to recommend a treatment.<eos> I can speak to the duty nurse... and we may be able to start as early as this evening.<eos> If you think it's necessary.<eos> Good.<eos> Greta?<eos> Greta?<eos> You're in luck, Mr. Lockhart.
Still here?<eos> Thought you were just visiting.<eos> You've looked better.<eos> Same to you.<eos> How's the car?<eos> That car was a piece of shit.<eos> Sanitarium offered me enough to buy a new one.<eos> So, gracias a Dios.<eos> Everything happens for a reason, right?<eos> You drink too much.
Surely you didn't just wander down here by accident?<eos> What is it exactly that you are looking for?<eos> I had a problem with my tooth.<eos> Your tooth?<eos> Actually, it's feeling much better.<eos> If you could just point me in the direction of my room.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> We can't let you get an infection.<eos> You must let us take care of you.<eos> After all... that's why you're here.
A side effect of the toxins leaving the body.<eos> And my leg, is that a delusion?<eos> Mr. Lockhart has been a disruptive element since he arrived.<eos> He stole confidential medical files... assaulted a member of our Dental staff... and threatened Mr. Pembroke.<eos> I didn't threaten anybody!<eos> I believe your exact words were...<eos> "If I have to, I'll hit him over the head "and drag him out by his hair."<eos> I was sent here to bring Pembroke back to New York!<eos> According to your employer, a Mr. Green... you're being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.<eos> You're one of them.

That's what this is all about?<eos> The evil doctor killing off his patients?<eos> That's right.<eos> All right.<eos> Perhaps we should consult Mr. Pembroke.<eos> Do you know this man?<eos> He tried to take me back against my will.<eos> Pembroke?<eos> Please keep him away from me.<eos> You were dead.
What have they done to you?<eos> Done to me?<eos> I've never felt better.<eos> Relax, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> It'll all be over soon.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Remarkable creatures.<eos> Anywhere else on the planet, this species lives a dozen years, at most.<eos> Here, in our aquifer... they can live 300.<eos> For the human physiology... the effect of the water can be quite toxic as you have discovered.
It's the mark of the Commander's coalition.<eos> It means we are the 13th Clan.<eos> It means we are in this fight together.<eos> No.<eos> It's what farmers used to do to their livestock.<eos> Right before the slaughterhouse.<eos> You bet.<eos> I ain't no Grounder.<eos> Pike for chancellor!<eos> Sir, you should be on the ballot tomorrow.
You told him?<eos> The people of the Ark deserve to know what we're working on before we bring it on board.<eos> Today is Unity Day.<eos> Listen to your assistant, Doc.<eos> Ok. No.<eos> Please just stay out of this, Commander.<eos> Stay out of this?<eos> For two years, I've done everything humanly possible to keep this boat alive, and now I find out that not only did an artificial intelligence that you designed end the world, but you're still working on it.<eos> Listen to me, Doctor, and listen good.<eos> We're set to begin docking maneuvers in two hours, 13 space stations becoming one, possibly the greatest feat of engineering in human history, all designed to ride out the nightmare that you created.
Yes, we would. That would be lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hold on one moment. - (engine starts)<eos> I'll be back with a preliminary estimate.<eos> Sure.<eos> I have all day.<eos> - Crap. - (car honks)<eos> What the hell were you thinking? - What?<eos> - You pulled behind me, no warning!<eos> - Hey, you slammed into me.
Um, I can't... Make out the words.<eos> Would you like me to read it?<eos> "My dearest Philip, I do not know if you are alive or dead.<eos> I hope for the best, of course.<eos> Yet I feel compelled to write this letter to -- to say how much I miss you... And pray for your safe return.<eos> I cannot predict what the future holds, but I trust you will remain strong... And we will see each other again before too long."<eos> And then she signs it.<eos> A good girl, my addy.<eos> If she can't get here, then, by God, I'll rise from this bed soon enough, and I'll get to her if it takes my last breath.<eos> Private Starks, how are you?
Is there a problem?<eos> I don't like delays.<eos> Do you know who we are?<eos> My associates and I are the operational arm of "Scimitar."<eos> The Lombardo Square bombing, 1963.<eos> Murder of Henri Tyran, Canada, 1970.<eos> Konig Airport Massacre, 1971.<eos> Bottom line?<eos> You don't want to doubt me.<eos> You're a special kind of crazy.
- Um, what's happening? - Going once...<eos> It's what's not happening that is the concern.<eos> - Going twice...<eos> - Nobody else is bidding. - Sold!<eos> - Congratulations, Professor.<eos> You just bought yourself a nuclear weapon.<eos> Well, well.<eos> We seem to have a new player.<eos> But you seem a bit academic.<eos> How did you get in here and who are you?
But I've worked up a little something.<eos> Science is all about the future, right?<eos> I've developed a prototype particle tracker. Cutting edge.<eos> Probably gonna mint me $1,000,000.<eos> Wow.<eos> A whole million.<eos> Mm, be right back.<eos> I think I've got some chocolate chip cookie dough in the fridge.<eos> I cannot believe that that is you.<eos> Seriously, I had no idea you were ever cool.
Seriously, I had no idea you were ever cool.<eos> I wasn't cool.<eos> I was an arrogant little snot.<eos> Was?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for my younger self's particle tracker.<eos> Keep an eye on the door, and when I get back, stop flirting with me.<eos> You were the one flirting with me.<eos> Look, what's the big deal?<eos> I mean, younger you isn't married yet, so technically it's not cheating.
- His arrogant curiosity... - Yeah.<eos> He's curious and too smart for his own good, but I'm sure you can relate.<eos> You're just pissed you didn't see it coming sooner, and...<eos> That's not it.<eos> Although you are correct in observing my ire is self-directed.<eos> It's a rude awakening when one realizes that despite decades of what one thought was maturation and experience, you haven't really changed at all.<eos> That same arrogance I derided in my younger self was on full display at the weapons bazaar.<eos> Over 60 years on this planet, and I have learned nothing.<eos> I think you're being a little too hard on yourself.<eos> Which makes a nice change from you always being hard on me, but yeah, you're arrogant.
Welcome to Great Paxford, boys.<eos> Well, the poor devils look absolutely shattered.<eos> Hardly surprising given they had to fight their way out of Czechoslovakia and across half of Europe.<eos> At least Churchill committed to getting them out.<eos> I've been thinking. Someone who knows Adam ought to say a few words at the thanksgiving service in his absence and as president of the WI -<eos> Hardly appropriate for a member of a secular pacifist organisation to comment on the silencing of church bells due to war.<eos> If anyone's likely to know what the vicar would have said under the circumstances, it would probably be the vicar's wife.<eos> Our country is in a state of war with Germany and, as of this morning, Italy.<eos> As a consequence this station is on high alert around the clock as is every man here.<eos> The last thing they need is the kind of distraction you've been offering Wing Commander Bowers.

It is not.<eos> We've wasted quite enough time on this.<eos> Aircraft Woman Campbell, you are to be dishonourably discharged from the WAAF effective immediately.
Scramble! Scramble!<eos> Scramble!<eos> Please don't be nice to me, Thomas.<eos> I simply want to leave and never come back.<eos> I'll drive you home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir.<eos> Mrs Brindsley.<eos> I'm sure I'm the last person you want to see. However, once again, I'm afraid the information you request is unavailable to the general public at the present time.<eos> I have an absolute right to whatever information you have.
- Let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Good morning, Mrs Barden.<eos> I was just wondering if Claire was home.<eos> She's not due back until later.<eos> Then Iwonder if you might give her this?<eos> So I might be among the first to offer my congratulations on her nuptials. Her what?<eos> Nuptials.<eos> To Spencer.<eos> I think you must have the wrong end of the stick or the wrong stick altogether.

Go, go, go.<eos> Eyes wide, eyes wide.<eos> During your DEA entrance interview you were asked the following question,<eos> "Have you or any of your friends or family ever used,<eos> "possessed or distributed a Schedule I narcotic?"<eos> Okay.<eos> You answered in the negative.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You and Jack Glencoe were currently in a relationship at the time of that interview?
Is that correct?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You and Jack Glencoe were currently in a relationship at the time of that interview?<eos> Remind me of the date.<eos> October 14, the year 2012.<eos> Yes.<eos> Given Mr. Glencoe's history on drug abuse, would you care to explain your answer?<eos> I lied.<eos> Special Agent Nate Lowry briefed us on your helpfulness during a recent Russian mafia takedown.<eos> He seems to feel that you are an indispensable member of this task force.
Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Can I get a Maker's, please?<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, what's unfortunate is that's the one novel of his that I identify the most with.<eos> Philip Roth.<eos> The Human Stain?<eos> Well, that's why I said it's unfortunate.<eos> You must be a professor.

I've got the whole thing on tape.<eos> Come on, get me out of here.<eos> Jesus, Sergei, come on.<eos> My hand.<eos> Here.<eos> Come here and get this.<eos> All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> What the...<eos> Special Agent in charge, Dan Renner.<eos> I understand you were first on the scene.
That's right.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who's that?<eos> - He might be able to help us.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> He's... He's my CI.<eos> It's better if I talk to him alone.<eos> Steve, he's with me.<eos> If he gives you anything...<eos> You'll be the first I tell.
Am I keeping you, Mr. Dinard?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Glad to hear it.<eos> The court rules in favor of the State.<eos> Your Honor, please.<eos> - Sir, listen, I had a deal.<eos> - We're done.<eos> - Your deal is not my concern.<eos> - Why not?<eos> This court has full discretion and has no obligation to honor any previous arrangements that you might've made.

Then can you confirm the Teetonka Chicago Inc.<eos> Was in the process of being sold?<eos> Is that right?<eos> No?<eos> Then how do you explain the articles in the Tribune discussing the sale to Blasko Industries?<eos> I didn't say it wasn't happening, I said I couldn't confirm it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - It's called a "non-disclosure agreement".<eos> I'm not asking you to discuss anything confidential.<eos> You're asking me to discuss information that you already have, which is a waste of our time.
- I thought she was dead.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There goes that drink.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yes, stop asking that.<eos> Ma'am, Harper Deakins, DEA.<eos> With the Chicago Gang Task Force.<eos> This is Detective Patrick Finnegan.<eos> We're hoping you can help us with something.
- Right now!<eos> You met my mom. I'll met her. - Come on.<eos> This is absurd!<eos> I'm not in a prison here, am I?<eos> Is this Attica?<eos> You going to call in Governor Rockefeller?<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> I just lost one of my best friends.<eos> She's being buried this afternoon.<eos> I cannot miss the funeral, and you can't keep me from going.
Now when I come down the stairs on Sunday, no game, no cursing. No Bob!<eos> No Stan.<eos> Why? !<eos> Nailed it!<eos> But I can beat it.<eos> Name's Roger. I'm female.<eos> My second husband's name was Eric, and as it turned out, he died by my own hand.<eos> Did it just happen?<eos> You have to be more specific.<eos> I have no idea what you're t... oh, my husband's death, yes!
A.K.A., The Basement Creep, A.K.A., Midnight Lace!<eos> Principal Lewis, what are you doing in our basement?<eos> I honestly have no clue. Last thing I remember, I was climbing in that window.<eos> Anyway, the belt is mine! Ah!<eos> Careful.<eos> This isn't what we're doing.<eos> Light touch, light touch.<eos> Wrestling is all about the pagean...<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my god! You're our principal!
Very good.<eos> Wonderful in fact. But...<eos> let's try it a little differently this time.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Let's try.<eos> Well, let's see, ﬁrst of all why don't we dispense with the mirthless chuckle.<eos> - No mirthless chuckle.<eos> - No, no need, really.<eos> It was a bad idea, bad directorial, my fault, over thinking the thing.<eos> Well if you say so, but I'm happy to do another, maybe try her one more time.
- Mr. Cuddahy.<eos> They mix a hell of a Mai Tai. I like this place.<eos> Sorry to keep you hanging, it's a tough decision.<eos> Nothing to apologize for, we said the deal was on the table for a week.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm trying to quit.<eos> I just wanted to visit again to see if there was some impediment we could help with, or if something in the offer isn't clear?<eos> The offer's very clear.<eos> And very generous.<eos> We want to make it easy for you to say yes.

Our understanding of the true workings of history, give us access to the levers of power.<eos> Your studio, for instance, is a pure instrument of capitalism.<eos> As such it expresses the contradictions of capitalism, and can be enlisted to ﬁnance its own destruction.<eos> Which is exciting!<eos> It can be made to help the little guy, the regular Joe.<eos> - The body politic!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Even though it's purpose is to exploit the little guy.<eos> - And the body politic.<eos> - You are for the little guy.
When Chubby Cregar was intoxicated and hit that pedestrian on Gower, we had that vehicle title transferred to Joe's name and Joe did 6 months in LA County lock-up.<eos> But you're off the sauce now?<eos> I never touch it.<eos> It was a legal ﬁction.<eos> That's right.<eos> When the studio needs someone who meets the legal standard of...<eos> - how did you put it, Sid?<eos> - Personhood.<eos> Joe steps in and acts as the, uh... person.<eos> So you're a professional... person?

We recently arrested a man named William Crandall.<eos> He was a scientist working at a lab called Foster Medical Research, but in fact, he was a member of Directorate S spying for your government, stealing secrets to be used in your nation's biological weapons program.<eos> That's... very surprising.<eos> To my knowledge, my country doesn't have a biological weapons program.<eos> In fact, it is my understanding, according to the treaties, yours doesn't have one either.<eos> So it would be shocking to discover that you're working on such a...<eos> We only work on research to create antidotes and medicines for the weapons we know you're making.<eos> You should really make these baseless accusations to the Ambassador.<eos> I'm just Cultural Attaché, as you know.<eos> We know exactly who you are, and we will be speaking to the Ambassador directly, as well as to the Foreign Minister in Moscow.
Good morning, ladies!<eos> I just want to remind everyone that Superintendent Greg is coming today.<eos> This visit needs to be flawless after Ms. Feldman's potato battery explosion last year.<eos> I will not be humiliated like that again.<eos> Everyone needs to be on their best behavior.<eos> Ms. Cannon.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Don't worry. I'll be using fractions to teach about the inequalities transgender people face.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You're studying shapes.
So how green you want to fucking get?<eos> You know, I know you from somewhere.<eos> Didn't you used to roll with that black guy, Ghost?<eos> Used to, past tense.<eos> Why, is there a problem?<eos> No, there is no problem.<eos> I just don't like doing business with niggers.<eos> Can't trust them.<eos> You'll be hearing from me soon.<eos> You're way more expensive than the other top security firms.
I just don't like doing business with niggers.<eos> Can't trust them.<eos> You'll be hearing from me soon.<eos> You're way more expensive than the other top security firms.<eos> I've heard we're about twice as much.<eos> You heard right.<eos> We're worth it.<eos> My men are military trained at identifying conflict and suppressing it before the situation gets out of hand.<eos> They contain and control because once a brawl breaks out, it's too late.<eos> If you hire me, you and your patrons will be completely safe within these walls, safer than they've ever been before.
I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> We can add charges to the indictment.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> The slot was opened.<eos> What happened next?<eos> The only reason why I am still alive is because the Jimenez are so cheap.<eos> You get what you pay for.<eos> Shut up.<eos> And you're sure the Jimenez sent the assassin?
Sweetie, you know I'm no good at arguments, so I brought in a professional.<eos> Hello, ma'am, my name's Blake, and I'm a retired FBI hostage negotiator.<eos> I wouldn't say this is a hostage situation.<eos> Mm, no one said it was, ma'am.<eos> I'm just here to listen.<eos> So that was step one:<eos> listening.<eos> Next, empathy.<eos> I'm standing right here, you know.<eos> Mm, it must be frustrating for you to hear me talk like you're invisible.
Big kiss.<eos> Ciao.<eos> I've got nothing to lose now. And I'll do what it takes to get you to tell me.<eos> I just want to know who they are.<eos> On the night shift a man came in with his head split because some lads mugged him for 20 euros.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> Be careful anyway.<eos> Wrist injuries can get complicated if you don't look after them, so the less you move it, the better.<eos> This is in case you want to report it.
Yes, sir.<eos> I need your signature up here.<eos> I'll be in touch in a few weeks about your arraignment.<eos> Uh, contact a lawyer before you come or one will be appointed for you.<eos> Wait, you said that if we cooperated, that Clayton wouldn't go to jail.<eos> I said that I would do everything I could to help.<eos> You will be entering into a deferred prosecution agreement.<eos> I-I would've called our lawyer if you'd made that clear.<eos> Christina needs us. She needs both of us here.<eos> You have no idea how hard this has been on our family.
Sir?<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Can I have your license and registration please, sir?<eos> Please take your hood down, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Industrial accident, factory fire.<eos> That sweet bastard went back inside to save a cat.<eos> Cat made it out fine.<eos> I need to see everybody's ID, please.<eos> Here you go, officer.
They were real secretive about them, though.<eos> - Did they pay you what they owe you?<eos> - No. No, sir, they didn't.<eos> No, after the guns came out, Leonard and me were held until Soldier and Angel arrived, and... And all hell broke loose.<eos> Does this name Softboy mccall ring a bell?<eos> No, I ca- ... I can't say it does.<eos> He was this Howard fella's cellmate in Leavenworth<eos> Tied to a bank robber a few decades ago.<eos> Some money came up missing right around the same river.<eos> I noticed that you have a prison record of your own.
They came for Dollar Bill yesterday, but it was an attack on all of us.<eos> - Right. Right. - Yeah.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah. - And I feel it. Do you?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Any one of us could be next.<eos> We're with you, Bobby!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Do you think this makes me happy, Bill?
Today is one day after.<eos> You have one chance to avoid a cell.<eos> Give me Axelrod.<eos> The day after Pearl Harbor, everybody knew a Japanese invasion would be coming.<eos> Air raid wardens. Anti-aircraft artillery.<eos> Cities blacked out.<eos> Mothers and fathers staying by the door with baseball bats and kitchen knives, bellies full of fear of the invading hordes.<eos> I know what he means to you.<eos> I know you're a loyal man, and I admire that.<eos> But this is what you know.
Before they pick where they wanna dump the story for maximum impact.<eos> So we get our version out first.<eos> You need your friend Lilly to speak up.<eos> Say that she saw Layner drinking, tried to stop him from taking the kids in the car.<eos> - She won't.<eos> - She will.<eos> I'll get to her today.<eos> I asked Chief Mueller to join us so can break down how things will go at his former command... Southampton PD.<eos> Mr. Axelrod, I received some Intel just as I was arriving here today.<eos> The police out East may have come into possession of a video of the incident taking on someone's phone, which purports to show you striking Mr. Layner.
Depending on what you want, I can get on the phone and bring you a dozen offers by 5 p.m.<eos> Can we...<eos> Let's slow this down.<eos> I need to be discreet.<eos> Understood.<eos> This is just a reconnaissance mission. I'm not committing here.<eos> You're not sure what you want, which is a new feeling for someone like you.<eos> That won't work on me. I know all the tricks.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Plus, you're brilliant.

People are burning and dying.<eos> And everyone you work with sees it happen.<eos> So you call a broker... Lincoln Chang in Jersey City... and have him short aviation stocks in the European markets.<eos> Then US hotels, shipping.<eos> You go against it all.<eos> The second plane hits.<eos> Everyone you work with is dead.<eos> People are lining up to give blood.<eos> New York's bravest, your wife-to-be's brother, runs into the buildings to help.<eos> He never comes back out, while you sit back in your chair with a smile on your face making hundreds of millions of dollars.
OK.<eos> Is it the original floor?<eos> It was partly renovated.<eos> But the whole place has wooden floors.<eos> And here... is another big room.<eos> My, it's very red!<eos> It was the owner's study.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?
Don't you want to join him?<eos> No, and I don't speak Russian.<eos> My family and friends are here.<eos> Your boyfriend's over there.<eos> First love is a precious thing.<eos> You fight for it.<eos> I don't know...<eos> - No?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - You're the first to say that.
Did you stalk him?<eos> That's insane!<eos> Who's the victim in all of this?<eos> Whose credit card is blocked?<eos> It's not up to me to justify myself.<eos> It's always like that, for some reason.<eos> The victim has to justify herself.<eos> The woman's always suspected.<eos> I find that shocking.<eos> Constance, you called your former boss 1,985 times between November 8, 2013 and March 4, 2014.
I didn't really want to lay a lung transplant on you when you were terrified about Norman.<eos> I mean about you and Emma.<eos> I guess this is me telling you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I hope she's okay.<eos> Me too.<eos> Be safe, Norma, okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be Miss Decody.
- Hi.<eos> - Um, my name is Norma Bates, and I would like to bring my son to you for a diagnosis.<eos> Oh, well, feel free to call my office and make an appointment.<eos> Okay, but it's a bit of an emergency.<eos> Then you should call 911...<eos> Oh, no, no, it's like... it's not a 911 kind of p... a problem.<eos> I'm... I'm...<eos> I'm a single mother. My son is 18.<eos> He's having a lot of emotional problems right now and, uh, you know, it's hard being a woman alone with no one to turn to for help.<eos> I bet you could help me.
Okay. Okay, thank you very much.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Hi, I'm running out to pick up my son.<eos> I thought you might like some breakfast.<eos> How kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm starving, actually.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> You really are nice, aren't you?
Thank you.<eos> I'm starving, actually.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> You really are nice, aren't you?<eos> Emma said you were.<eos> The one time you ran into her in the village?<eos> I didn't meet her in the village.<eos> I'm Emma's mother.<eos> You're Emma's mother?
Ah, my friend.<eos> Better prices here. No, no, I...<eos> Better prices here.<eos> - I'm going here.<eos> This Armenian dog will rob you.<eos> Get back to your thieves' den.<eos> Always trying to steal my customers.<eos> Please.<eos> What can I sell you today?<eos> Are you Mr. Mesrob Boghosian?
Oh, they are my friends.<eos> They saved us, thank God.<eos> Mesrob has been deported to Chankiri.<eos> They took our house, everything.<eos> And then they came and...<eos> We are good friends of your son Michael from Constantinople.<eos> Michael is dead.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> There are spies everywhere.<eos> You're a foreigner.
I saw.<eos> He wants us to help his... his wife and his family escape.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> And after that, he'll be gone, and we'll never see him again.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Mr. Myers, when you arrive in Bassek, find reverend Antreassian.<eos> He'll arrange the boats for you, and tell him we'll be along with the rest of the orphans as soon as we can.<eos> Thank you. You're a brave man.
The United States is not at war with Turkey.<eos> Myers attacked our men, and he has been collaborating with traitors.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> He's a world-renowned journalist.<eos> He's a spy.<eos> And he has used journalism to smear the ottoman empire and its soldiers around the world with his fabrication about the relocation of the Armenians.<eos> Minister, you are using this so-called relocation as a cover for the systematic extermination of the Armenian people.<eos> Christopher Myers has been reporting this outrage to the world.<eos> That is why you want to silence him.<eos> Ambassador, you're Jewish.
Alchemilla mollis.<eos> And that only grows in patches by the roadside.<eos> Don't see any here.<eos> Frank?<eos> Look for this.<eos> Might give us an idea which direction she travelled from onto the moor.<eos> So what killed her?<eos> - Come on, Marcus.<eos> Something.<eos> - No. - You'll get shirty if I change my mind.
Not unless I can link him directly.<eos> Where were the daughters on Saturday?<eos> Er, they stayed over at Christine's place.<eos> Did you corroborate that, like I asked you?<eos> I will do, yes.<eos> And then take a trip around Nicole's neighbours.<eos> Get a feel for the family.<eos> I mean, you don't not chase it when your mam fails to turn up, do you?<eos> But there again, she has left them before.<eos> If it was my mam, I'd dial 999 after half an hour, wouldn't you?
As soon as she arrives, it's just "tap-tap-tap".<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks, love.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I got carried away.<eos> - I'll say.<eos> So is it true?<eos> Was she really picking up fellas in the pub?<eos> How about chasing blokes younger than herself?<eos> Because if it is true, and you failed to mention it in our earlier interview --
She wasn't in so I left.<eos> So why are non of these pick-ups on the computer at the cab firm?<eos> Because obviously I don't charge my own girlfriend.<eos> Lucky her -- personal chauffeur.<eos> It wasn't just a passing thing.<eos> If her daughters wasn't a factor I would probably be moved in by now.<eos> So why was she selling the house?<eos> I didn't know she was.<eos> She was up to all sorts.<eos> Were you the recipient of this text?
Well, it's a bit late for that.<eos> Best thing you can do is co-operate.<eos> Now, Anne Marie had a plan to move Nicole out.<eos> Yes.<eos> Everything in place to get her away from the vicious piece of work she calls a husband.<eos> But the man with the cash, he takes his time handing over the money.<eos> What man?<eos> What cash?<eos> She was smarter than you.<eos> You were just nastier.
Everything in place to get her away from the vicious piece of work she calls a husband.<eos> But the man with the cash, he takes his time handing over the money.<eos> What man?<eos> What cash?<eos> She was smarter than you.<eos> You were just nastier.<eos> So Anne Marie texts Nicole, "Running late, be with you soon."<eos> Only the poor love makes a mistake.<eos> Instead of texting the secret phone they've been using behind your back... she texts her usual phone.<eos> And you pick it up, cos you're at home.
You shot an unarmed woman in the back.<eos> We know the kind of man you are.<eos> I told her I was going round to Christine's to talk.<eos> She said... She said she was coming with me.<eos> Aye, of course she did, because she knew you were a danger.<eos> She didn't want you knocking her other daughter about!<eos> Half way there, I says to her, "I know you know."<eos> Aye, and you lost it and you strangled her.<eos> It was her who got things out of hand, she called 999!<eos> And you cut the call!

It's all very normal. Given the circumstances.<eos> [Sighs] Your son was 8 years old when he was taken.<eos> I know. We have done the math. Thank you.<eos> So Adam spent more time with his kidnapper - than he ever did at home.<eos> - No.<eos> For all practical purposes, this guy was Adam's family.<eos> - I know that this is hard to hear...<eos> I know. No.<eos> ...but you've got to wrap your head around...<eos> You are his doctor, all right?
See what time it is?<eos> Why did you confess to a crime you didn't commit?<eos> You know why.<eos> I want to hear you say it.<eos> They had stuff on me.<eos> They threatened me.<eos> - Oh, so you're the victim here?<eos> - I am a victim.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> No, you're not innocent.

They threatened me.<eos> - Oh, so you're the victim here?<eos> - I am a victim.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> No, you're not innocent.<eos> We stopped looking because you said you killed him.<eos> And that money they gave you... that doesn't make you a victim.<eos> It makes you a liar, it makes you a coward, and it makes you as sick as the bastard who did it.<eos> I didn't lock the boy in a basement.<eos> No. You just made sure that he stayed there.
Hey, hey, um, is he going to the dentist anytime soon?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Those bunkers are actually part of the oil refinery.<eos> So basically anyone who has ever worked at this refinery could've known how to get into that tunnel.<eos> Uh, if you can get us contact info for current and former employees, that would be more than helpful.<eos> That I can do.<eos> How far along?<eos> Oh, technically, six months.<eos> When I try and get off the couch, 20. - Mm.<eos> - You have kids?
Gabe Clements. I should've introduced myself before.<eos> I was taken with your board over there.<eos> Very, uh, "Beautiful Mind."<eos> Anything else you need from me?<eos> Why?<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Aren't I?<eos> Oh, 'cause I'm the Fed, I'm supposed to say,<eos> "This is my case and we play by my rules, so you're on desk duty"?<eos> You live here.
But at the same time, the readjustment and with the attention, the media, the election, how do you handle all that?<eos> Well, it's not easy, Julia.<eos> You know, we're... uh, just trying to take it slow.<eos> Claire, are you okay?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> We are so lucky to have gotten our son back, but we are not okay.<eos> And, honestly, I don't know if we're ever going to be okay.<eos> A thing like this, it, uh...<eos> it changes you forever.<eos> That's a very candid and understandable perspective, but does it also enable your detractors when they say that this might not be the best time for you to be entering the governor's race?
Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Yes, yes, I would. Even though Mr. Asher was innocent?<eos> He may have been innocent of taking Adam, but, um, he's not innocent.<eos> He was a convicted sex offender, Julia, after all.<eos> Let's not forget that. And statistics show that sex criminals re-offend exponentially more often than they don't.<eos> Even after incarceration, treatment, reha... after our best efforts at rehabilitation, we let them report their own whereabouts?<eos> We currently trust them to keep current with their own parole?<eos> I hope that you and Annie... -We let these people police themselves.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You're that guy.
Charlie: Mayor Warren.<eos> Please, call me Claire.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Then it's "Charlie," too.<eos> Thank you for making the drive up.<eos> I asked you here to set some ground rules - before the bullets fly.<eos> - Very sportsmanlike.<eos> We both want what's best for this great state.<eos> So let's make this race about education and wages and energy.<eos> You're new to the scene, but races in Maine are won on issues, Claire, not celebrity.
- Very sportsmanlike.<eos> We both want what's best for this great state.<eos> So let's make this race about education and wages and energy.<eos> You're new to the scene, but races in Maine are won on issues, Claire, not celebrity.<eos> [Footsteps approaching] Yes, Scotty?<eos> I just need you to sign, sir.<eos> It's budget appropriations.<eos> It's a very complicated part of the job.<eos> Labor unions make it almost impossible at the state level.<eos> You dealt with any of that in, uh, whatsit?
You dealt with any of that in, uh, whatsit?<eos> Red Pines.<eos> That's it.<eos> Not as much.<eos> How many freshmen in the legislature right now?<eos> Is this lunch or a civics quiz?<eos> - You know all their names?<eos> - Of course I do. There aren't any.<eos> Not this year.<eos> You're having a moment, Claire.
Enjoy it. But it's not what this race is about.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> There are two.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, I assumed you meant the house, as well.<eos> There are two freshmen in the house...<eos> Cumberland and Jones... both women.<eos> So, they're probably very confused about that budget.<eos> But I look forward to setting them straight as governor.<eos> I understand you don't want me to talk about my son.
What the hell is that accent?<eos> French and African.<eos> Burkina Faso.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I'm reading his lips.<eos> I've come to ask for your assistance in finding this man. He is wanted for intellectual property theft, burglary... fraud.<eos> We have no clear photos, nor do we have a name, but I've tracked him across Europe for two years, and now I believe he's here and that you are tracking him, too.<eos> He stole nearly $5 million from two of your clients this year.<eos> Actually...<eos> You think the man you're looking for is the man we're looking for?
They're in protective custody.<eos> Except your sister, Melody-- but she's in London, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> FBI came to me last year, believe it or not, for help.<eos> What kind of help?<eos> The kind only rich people can give.<eos> And since I was looking for something good to do with my life instead of just partying and... getting into trouble, I said yes.<eos> I didn't realize it might get me killed.<eos> So you know why someone hacked into DHS.
You a college professor?<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hudson University.<eos> But you live here, in a gentlemen's club by yourself.<eos> Well, yeah, but I-I'm moving, to an apartment with my girlfriend. Oh.<eos> This place was just temporary, because...<eos> Long story.<eos> You and your friends seem to have a lot of those.
It's beautiful.<eos> Mr. Caan?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you know the rules?<eos> No.<eos> He'll know your name.<eos> You'll have two minutes.<eos> You can ask questions.<eos> He might give you a gift.<eos> And he can touch you, but you can't touch him.
Justice.<eos> Rooted in truth, watered by tenacity, and flowering in wisdom.<eos> May be the single most beautiful expression of humanity.<eos> For a man to dedicate his life in its pursuit rings of a certain nobility.<eos> And this day we gather to acknowledge that nobility in the Honorable Whit Wilcox.<eos> Devoted servant of justice and one of its most industrious sentinels.<eos> Congratulations, Judge Wilcox.<eos> And thank you for your noble service.<eos> Hello, Judge.<eos> You're going to jail.
Congratulations, Judge Wilcox.<eos> And thank you for your noble service.<eos> Hello, Judge.<eos> You're going to jail.<eos> You may even own it.<eos> You're a fucking liar.<eos> I said the Southern District wouldn't prosecute.<eos> I can't speak for Eastern.<eos> You'll be coming with us.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.
Then why is this meeting happening if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't exist?<eos> Because I need you to keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Privately.<eos> Publicly, the ATCU will still be the face of my administration's response to advanced threats.<eos> I'll appoint a new head to the agency, one who understands they answer to you.<eos> So we're your black-ops response.<eos> Isn't black ops where you feel most comfortable?<eos> I certainly prefer it to bureaucracy.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We'll keep doing what we do, and you'll keep pretending we don't exist.
Bigtime, yes, indeed.<eos> We'll hash out the details of that later.<eos> - Is there a dressing room?<eos> - This is a call.<eos> - You know how phones work.<eos> - Don't know if you know how acting works.<eos> - Not really, and I'm not interested.<eos> - We all have our process.<eos> Sometimes an item of clothing or footwear can define a character.<eos> Uh, you have your costume, I have mine.
Nice to see you.<eos> - He's a very confused man.<eos> - Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> He didn't even know about Jasmine.<eos> - Your daughter?<eos> - No, she's not my daughter.<eos> I've had the, uh, snip.<eos> No, she's, uh...<eos> Peter Easterman's daughter.<eos> - You had the snip, Green?
Then again, you didn't get any credit for the culling on the Ark, either.<eos> How many people suffocated when you threw away my radio?<eos> You know, at least Clarke was saving her own people.<eos> You were just saving your own ass.<eos> Of course that's nothing compared to killing your own mom.<eos> You just had to take little sister to her first dance.<eos> You might as well just shoved Aurora out of the airlock yourself.<eos> Do you think she'd be proud of you now for the kind of leader you've become,<eos> or would she see the truth like the rest of us do, that you're a follower?<eos> Clarke's been back for one day, you're already taking orders, the good, little knight by his queen's side.
Are you spying on me?<eos> You know, my personal life is none of your damn business.<eos> You're right.<eos> But the ATCU is, which you now run.<eos> And since you refuse to talk to me or return my calls,<eos> I didn't really have a choice.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> You know I'm technically your boss now, right?<eos> But I'd prefer to be partners.<eos> You are not now, nor will you ever be, my boss.
So it's a sneaky, little spy mission.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D., remember?<eos> That's how we roll.<eos> May, I've got one.<eos> No joke.<eos> My gut tells me Malick will have a presence there... someone in his pocket trying to influence the delegates while getting information on any inhumans.<eos> Sounds like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're the good guys.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but I hope you and Carla work things out for your son...
He was trying to assassinate you.<eos> Assassinate me?<eos> He's here to protect me.<eos> His absorbing powers don't seem so impressive now, not with all the inhumans around.<eos> Mr. Creel, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.<eos> Do you know how you got your powers?<eos> An experiment.<eos> Something went wrong.<eos> Something went right.<eos> You're the only human who survived contact with a terrigen Obelisk.

We won't need to cut off any hands, but...<eos> I will need to shake a few.<eos> Ms. Chen.<eos> Dr. Sean Lundwall.<eos> It's a beautiful place.<eos> Thank you for hosting.<eos> It's our pleasure.<eos> Fits like a glove.<eos> General Talbot.<eos> I must say, I'm quite honored that you're wearing a traditional long gown.
Well, maybe I can help you.<eos> I don't know if it can be helped.<eos> For you, controlling your power is like finding peace.<eos> For me, it's a... a war inside my head.<eos> I just don't want to lose control.<eos> Sometimes, it's good to lose control.<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> He just needs some rest.<eos> He won't remember any of it.<eos> Carla would be very happy to know you made it right.
Turns out we, but mostly you, have a very big problem.<eos> Oh, good gobsmackers, I did it again last night, didn't I?<eos> If you mean your impression of a sack of marbles being dumped in a dryer, then, yes, you did it.<eos> For six fucking hours straight.<eos> I am so sorry, Mrs. Reznikov.<eos> Ugh, this is so embarrassing.<eos> It's my greatest affliction.<eos> Mmm, I'm gonna say you weren't the afflicted one last night, no?<eos> You were asleep.<eos> I know, I know. But you have no idea.
Have you noticed?<eos> Reminds me of my second husband.<eos> Mmm. Lucky you.<eos> Look, frankly, I don't know why Mr. Caputo didn't leave me in my assigned bunk.<eos> I would've been perfectly happy there.<eos> Well, I'm sure you would've. That bunk was a bit... urban for you.<eos> You mean black?<eos> Well, no, I mean, you don't wanna be the only star in the night sky.<eos> Oh, I have no problem with black people, Mr. Healy.<eos> Do you?
-Oh, that's bullshit.<eos> -She would never do--<eos> -And yet she did.<eos> I know her.<eos> Do you, though?<eos> Do you?<eos> You think you understand what goes through her head in a place like this?<eos> Everybody in there is doing things they don't wanna do, every single day, things they're not proud of.<eos> Whatever it takes to keep your head above water.<eos> Do you believe in God, Mr. Caputo?
But for my end, I'll put up a first edition of my new book, The Great Boer War.<eos> Sir, I can handle this case myself.<eos> Without help from a writer and a magician.<eos> I'm quite familiar with police protocols.<eos> Yes, you regularly mock them and us in your stories.<eos> Sorry, gentlemen, but Sergeant Gudgett is absolutely correct.<eos> Aw, don't tell me you're still upset about our photo.<eos> If there's nothing else...<eos> Then I guess I'll have to play the Nicky card.<eos> You're going to call Sir Nicholas Hampstead, the head of Scotland Yard, because I won't facilitate a juvenile wager?
Merring wants to see ya.<eos> Could you find me a cup of coffee?<eos> - This is Constable Stratton.<eos> Arthur Conan Doyle.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> It's an honour, Mr Houdini.<eos> - You're really a cop?<eos> - One of the many wonders of the new century.<eos> Constable, you'll be assisting these gentlemen with their concurrent investigation into the murder of Sister Fabian.
- You're really a cop?<eos> - One of the many wonders of the new century.<eos> Constable, you'll be assisting these gentlemen with their concurrent investigation into the murder of Sister Fabian.<eos> Me?<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I won't disappoint.<eos> I think I'm gonna like this century.<eos> Constable.<eos> By 'concurrent', I mean 'extraneous and unnecessary'.<eos> So while they play detective, you'll play nurse maid, nothing more.
Understand?<eos> Yes, Chief Inspector.<eos> It's a Magdalene Laundry.<eos> They take in young women, some unwed mothers.<eos> In return, the girls work in the laundry.<eos> - Good morning, Sister...<eos> - Grace.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Sister Grace, I'm Constable Adelaide Stratton of Scotland Yard and Messrs Houdini and Doyle are special investigators assisting us.<eos> Wait. You're a policeman?
I could've sworn there was a glass sitting there.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Why are you lying?<eos> - Mr Houdini!<eos> I'm not.<eos> She's gone, you can drop this ridiculous story.<eos> I swear on my life, I'm telling the truth.<eos> - I saw Lucy.<eos> - A killer needs a motive.<eos> Why do you think Lucy wanted to murder Sister Fabian?
The £50 this place takes in.<eos> You're suggesting this was a robbery?<eos> I don't believe anything without evidence.<eos> Sister Fabian kept everything in here.<eos> Unfortunately, she had the only key and I have no idea where it is.<eos> Now I'm suggesting this was a robbery.<eos> Houdini was right, it was a robbery.<eos> - Sadly, yes.<eos> - I agree.<eos> You hoped I was right?
Yeats and Churchill will show up anywhere there's free booze.<eos> - But the king was busy tonight, so I hired an actor.<eos> - Right.<eos> But don't tell my mother.<eos> Your Majesty...<eos> That necklace is her birthday present.<eos> We never had much growing up.<eos> The best thing about my success is that I can give her the life she deserves.<eos> She is beautiful.<eos> - But you wanted to show me something.
- Damn! - That was necessary, time being of the essence and all that.<eos> Ah, I was just coming to see you.<eos> Now, I noticed you had a limp.<eos> - She has Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, characterized by hyper-flexible joints and a slight limp.<eos> And it's hereditary.<eos> One might expect that if Sister Grace were to have a child, they may be double-jointed, or even red-headed.<eos> Lucy was your daughter.<eos> And the killings, a mother's revenge.<eos> Not revenge... a mother's love.<eos> You were a Maggie, too.
Close it quick, or stick it in a drawer.<eos> I'm good either way.<eos> I'm sorry our head cheerleader's such a bitch, but let's focus on the big game, shall we?<eos> - What's next?<eos> - Lucille's tight with Roy.<eos> I'll hit the Peach Pussycat.<eos> That's right, Spring.<eos> His job is a visit to the local strip club.<eos> And he makes more than you.<eos> This one, you don't even want to know.
4C's a bedridden old guy who called Wilshire Division and got through.<eos> But 4D's a couple with a new baby who slept through the whole thing.<eos> 4E didn't hear anything, and I believe her, because 4E is a varsity alcoholic.<eos> Why don't you go back to 2F?<eos> See if that guy got back yet.<eos> I'm investigating what happened to that poor woman...<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I recognize you.<eos> You... used to run that brothel on Norton.
We've got to canvass the whole building again.<eos> We've got to check for strange visitors, overnight guests,<eos> - apparitions in the hallways.<eos> - Yeah. I never thought that screaming was coming from our roof.<eos> Marisa was such a sweet girl.<eos> To think about that happening to her...<eos> I got four kids, you know?<eos> Daughters.<eos> And it just makes me never want to take my eyes off of them again, you know?<eos> You got daughters?
Hey... - I, uh, I took down the chains.<eos> - Oh... - Don't arrest me.<eos> - Not my job.<eos> I'm homicide.<eos> I talked to, uh, 2F, finally. Mr. Lamb came home.<eos> We had a conversation.<eos> Turns out he's a stonecutter.<eos> He worked on the Masonic temple, the cathedral downtown.<eos> Of course, you know all that.<eos> He said that you let him keep his sculpting materials down here.

Who holds the key to that padlock?<eos> - I do.<eos> - That's what he said.<eos> He also said you have five children.

I don't care what anybody says.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Can you take a run at the suspect in A?<eos> I'm striking out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Suggestions?<eos> Well, his nickname is Peanut, so maybe you guys can bond over your tiny apple bags.<eos> Or... hatred of your father could be a fruitful area.<eos> Peanut.<eos> So you're a... you're a traveling salesman, Mr. Healy?

- Offered to pay for his dry-cleaning.<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - Morse is looking into a fatal fire in Jericho.<eos> Oh, and DC Parrish rang in sick this morning.<eos> Tummy bug.<eos> - How many does that make?<eos> - Three, sir, in CID.<eos> And five on 'B' Relief.<eos> Much more of it, we'll have to bus in reserves.<eos> - You're all right, are you?
After he threw in his degree, he came out here.<eos> - Why did he leave?<eos> A falling out?<eos> - No, nothing like that.<eos> He just, um... moved on.<eos> I don't think he got what we're about.<eos> - What are you about?<eos> - A simpler way.<eos> We have questions about ourselves, and the world, erm, what we're here for, what it means.<eos> And you're the leader of this, er... whatever you want to call it.
- Claimed?<eos> - There was no-one there, so far as I could see.<eos> - Where was the father?<eos> - Out.<eos> He says he got in about one, fell asleep on the sofa downstairs.<eos> Found this, sir.<eos> Caught on a branch in the garden.<eos> Now, there was a dentist's surgery in Summertown turned over yesterday.<eos> WPC Trewlove says there was a bottle of chloroform with the takings.<eos> When the call comes, and it will, it's very important you stay calm.
Come alone and on foot.<eos> If I see the police, the deal's off, the girl's dead.<eos> How do I know you'll do as you say?<eos> How do I know she's even alive?<eos> - Daddy!<eos> No!<eos> - Give it to me!<eos> Don't hurt her!<eos> Please don't hurt her!<eos> You're a businessman, think of this as a business transaction.
You should have waited outside.<eos> Well, the sign says "All are welcome".<eos> All are welcome.<eos> To worship.<eos> It's not my first time in a meeting house, Mrs Maddox.<eos> I know what is and isn't welcome.<eos> I was raised in Quakerism.<eos> So far as my father would allow.<eos> I wanted to ask you a few questions about the Richardsons.<eos> A happy family, would you say?
If I see the police, the deals off, the girl is dead.<eos> H-how do I know you'll do as you say?<eos> How do I know she's even alive?<eos> Daddy!<eos> No!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Don't hurt her! Please don't hurt her!<eos> You're a businessman.<eos> Think of this as a business transaction.<eos> You're a businessman. Think of this as a...
H-how do I know you'll do as you say?<eos> How do I know she's even alive?<eos> Daddy!<eos> No!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Don't hurt her! Please don't hurt her!<eos> You're a businessman.<eos> Think of this as a business transaction.<eos> You're a businessman. Think of this as a...<eos> You're a businessman. Think of this as a business transaction.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Miss Thursday.<eos> The voice on the tape was exactly that.<eos> A recording of Hallward.<eos> The kidnapper assumed it would be Mr Richardson on the phone. But at one point, Mrs Richardson picks up the receiver and says...<eos> - No!<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - So?<eos> - The kidnapper then says...<eos> You're a businessman...
Come to the phone box on Merton Street at 4am.<eos> Come alone and on foot.<eos> If I see the police, the deal's off, the girl is dead.<eos> How do I know you'll do as you say?<eos> How do I know she's even alive?<eos> Daddy!<eos> No! - It stops.<eos> - Yes.<eos> When Mister Richardson starts speaking.<eos> You're a businessman, think of this as a business transaction.
Hunter, Bobbi, are you there?<eos> Come in.<eos> Over.<eos> Sorry. Can't talk right now, boss.<eos> We're in the belly of the beast.<eos> We'll call you when we land.<eos> 3x13 - "Parting Shot"<eos> _<eos> Incroyable.<eos> How you are alive, sitting here, is a miracle to me.
Your father was a police officer in Kent.<eos> 1 cup of pearl barley, 2 cups sour cream...<eos> - Why did you go to Siberia?<eos> - We were on vacation.<eos> You really want to know my secret?<eos> Chicken bouillon.<eos> I will get answers.<eos> When did you divorce Mr. Hunter? We know you were lying about the soldiers.<eos> We have three bodies that someone must answer for.<eos> How did you and Ms. Morse get into the country? There are no records of you flying into Russia.
At least that mystery's solved.<eos> The General always did have a temper.<eos> W-What ...<eos> What set him off this time?<eos> He found, uh, the attach้'s position on Inhumans offensive because the General himself is an Inhuman.<eos> It's the world's first Inhuman politician.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One who happens to have access to nuclear launch codes.<eos> That does complicate matters, doesn't it?<eos> We know you have a history with the Prime Minister, - so we were hoping that ...
The son of a bitch is loving this.<eos> He's got them right in the palm of his hand.<eos> - Where is the General now?<eos> - He's, uh, on site, in restraints.<eos> Must be the Inhuman Bob and I saw.<eos> I can help you.<eos> But not ... not because I'm a fan of... powered individuals working for Mother Russia.<eos> Truth is, this is bigger than any single country's fate.<eos> We are at a tipping point, where humanity... is going to make some difficult choices about... the preservation of our very existence, and these Inhumans ... these Inhumans are the key to our survival.<eos> And we must ally with them, build a home for them, a sanctuary, like you're doing here.
Let's be frank, Matthew. What matters here is only how things appear.<eos> And for me, this appears to be a disaster.<eos> This incident will go public, and I will have to explain how not one, not two, but three members of my government were murdered.<eos> To be fair... two of them were trying to kill you... sir.<eos> Remind me ... who is this man?<eos> Advisor to our ATCU.<eos> He, uh ...<eos> he tracks enhanced threats.<eos> Threats like your very own Minister of Defense, General Androvich, who I believe was trying to assassinate you.<eos> So you claim.
It's time.<eos> I'll have your things sent to you.<eos> And frankly, you should be more careful when making your vacation plans next time.<eos> We are so sorry, sir.<eos> - It's all yours, Inspector.<eos> - Merci.<eos> So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.
We're doing the best that we can, so let's try to stay positive.<eos> Mr. Cowen, I'm a father also, so I can imagine how difficult this must be.<eos> Rest assured, we're on top of it.<eos> I appreciate that, Agent.<eos> So, anything you can tell me, at all, about John and Susie?<eos> Any troubles? Not that I know of.<eos> They seem very much in love.<eos> Is there any tension between you and your daughter?<eos> No, no.<eos> Why do you ask? Well, you seem to be a man of means, but your daughter had to raise money for her own honeymoon.
Can I get you anything?<eos> Here you are, love.<eos> I got you both a cup of tea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Only... I need to ask you some questions about Jamie.<eos> - Well, can't it wait?<eos> - No, unfortunately, it can't.<eos> - Grace?<eos> - It's OK.<eos> Did you and Jamie keep in touch?
Did you and Jamie keep in touch?<eos> Of course.<eos> We... We'd text now and then... and I spoke to him about a month ago.<eos> And when did he leave home?<eos> July last year.<eos> - Why did he leave?<eos> - He got a job.<eos> Oh, so there were no problems at home, anything I should know about?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> He wasn't in any trouble that you know of?
- I never received that.<eos> - Yes, you did, because yesterday you erased it.<eos> But luckily we've managed to retrieve it from the server.<eos> Do you wanna hear it?<eos> It's me. Can you call me back?<eos> I need to speak with you.<eos> I'm in a bit of trouble.<eos> I could do with somewhere to stay.<eos> Just call me when you can.<eos> Now, Jamie left that voicemail at 8:32am Tuesday morning, the day he was killed. And according to the phone company, you played it at 8:36am.
I thought he was messing.<eos> Well, it doesn't sound like he's messing to me, love.<eos> - Does it you, DS Healy?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> He packed his bags, Tuesday morning.<eos> Did he turn up on your doorstep?<eos> Didn't you go to the fairground?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Because you turned your back on him.
Well, why are they taking your car?<eos> How'd you find out about Lovers' Corner?<eos> From the teenagers at the fairground?<eos> - What?<eos> - They tell you about a party up there?<eos> You've been there recently.<eos> I'm just trying to work out why.<eos> - I haven't been there.<eos> - Are you sure about that?<eos> You drive a Toyota Corolla.
The DNA test came back on the accreted deposits on the back of the crucifix.<eos> I ran it against the DNA database.<eos> It's not conclusive. It's a mixed profile.<eos> But there are striking similarities to a name in the system.<eos> Convictions for possession, car theft, assault.<eos> Mrs. Haleford?<eos> - Caught me.<eos> - Can we have a word?<eos> Do you want me to fetch George?<eos> No, you'll do just fine, love.
We checked for prints.<eos> OK.<eos> You can tell Mr. Pevensey he can reopen.<eos> Will do.<eos> See you in the morning, then.<eos> Night.<eos> Whatever it is, Mark... leave it till tomorrow.<eos> I've just got the transcript of my evidence.<eos> Aye, you did well.<eos> Do you think... Well...
- Just walk away, Mr. Pevensey.<eos> - Mr. Haleford?<eos> Come on, this way.<eos> So, what were you doing at the fairground?<eos> I wanted to ask about Brendan.<eos> Looked like you were trying to start a fight.<eos> - I'm not wanting to press charges.<eos> - Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.
So let's go back to Brendan.<eos> Here's what I think happened.<eos> 12th April last year, Brendan storms out of his home and lo and behold, he turns up at the funfair and your paths crossed.<eos> - And on that same evening, 12th April, you were admitted to Newcastle AE with a broken arm.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> - How did you break your arm?<eos> - I fell over at the fairground.<eos> Only, funnily enough, round about the same time, Brendan had his head caved in.<eos> So did the pair of you have a fight?<eos> He turns up at the fairground. You think he's gonna do your caravan over and you whacked him one?
And what about Jodie?<eos> Was she in on all this with you? No.<eos> She had nothing to do with any of it.<eos> Nothing to do with what, pet?<eos> Hello?<eos> You've got my daughter - Jodie Pevensey.<eos> I want to see her.<eos> I need to speak to her now, please.<eos> Brendan did come to the fair.<eos> But it wasn't like you said.
Cos Harris can't keep his mouth shut.<eos> Am I right?<eos> He came to the office to tell us what Harris had said.<eos> Jamie said that he had to do the right thing.<eos> He had to tell the police.<eos> That reverend's small act of kindness in giving this lad shelter over Christmas.<eos> So Jamie felt he owed him.<eos> So I said I'd help him.<eos> I asked Jamie to... .. to show me where Harris had said that the body was.<eos> Even though you knew.
I'm sorry.<eos> Just one sec.<eos> About that favor... you wouldn't happen to have the number for the U.S. Attorney's office?<eos> Oh, never mind, I got it.<eos> Uh, U.S. Department of Justice...<eos> Office of Enforcement Operations.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Zealously protecting my client's rights.<eos> Local DA's don't have jurisdiction over the witness protection program.<eos> That's solely determined by the U.S. Attorney's office, a.k.a. the Feds, who are probably just as douchey as you are, but at least they can deliver on their promises... and their threats.
I wanna talk to a lawyer.<eos> -I need backup at 4126.<eos> -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> -Come on, that's not necessary.<eos> -Not if you cooperate, sir.<eos> If I talk to you, I won't get in trouble?<eos> I swear to God, Ms. Dunbar.<eos> It's all true.<eos> Then where's the proof?<eos> I don't have the means, but you do.
He's trying to turn this back around on us.<eos> We need to deny, forcefully.<eos> I'm already putting a press avail together at your next event.<eos> Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.<eos> -What do you have in mind?<eos> -I'm not sure.<eos> Look at this.<eos> It came from the goddamn White House!<eos> We're questioning the photographer now, sir.<eos> I've got a statement prepared that this was a run-of-the-mill event, that you took photos with lots of re-enactors.
I've been better.<eos> I'm still on duty.<eos> Is there... anything I can do?<eos> You could go out and stuff some ballot boxes for me.<eos> -You'll bounce back from this.<eos> -I sure hope I can.<eos> Uh, when I got fired... from the Capitol Police... I mean, I know it doesn't compare, but...<eos> I felt pretty bad.<eos> I thought my career was over.<eos> Then you turned everything around.
You're here for Daisy, not the cause.<eos> So commitment is a question.<eos> But I am here.<eos> And your control issues didn't stop with A.A.<eos> You went nuclear on Lash, on Creel.<eos> I had reasons both times.<eos> But you didn't follow orders.<eos> You can't just be at S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> You have to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And I'm trying to be, but you don't make it easy.
You're a liar.<eos> It's all lies.<eos> Daisy should be able to access these.<eos> Were they preparing for a second target?<eos> He was stalling.<eos> But why?<eos> To keep us distracted, but from what?<eos> From talking to our people?<eos> But we'd already sent agents to his... to his compound.<eos> Blake kept talking about you working with... freaks.
I kept my part of the deal.<eos> Now I expect you to keep yours.<eos> I want weaponry.<eos> And not that Stark Industries reissue crap.<eos> I'm talking about the big guns.<eos> So we can finally hunt down these freaks.<eos> Yes.<eos> Freaks.<eos> If everything goes as planned, we'll all get what we want, Mr. Blake.<eos> Our common enemies will be dead, and you'll have troops, armed to the teeth, at your command. Yeah.
Right.<eos> Not that one, mate.<eos> That's the clown's!<eos> Mr. Benton?<eos> DCI Stanhope.<eos> I'm heading the investigation.<eos> - Thanks, love.<eos> - Was it a hit and run?<eos> Well, possibly.<eos> So, you work for the Carswells, yes?
- Attacked with a knife.<eos> Single puncture wound.<eos> And someone went out of that window.<eos> Well, he's a big fella to mess with. - Any ID?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> Set of keys, some loose change... And a bus ticket from Bebington.<eos> But that's...what?<eos> 10 miles away, isn't it?<eos> What's a Bebington fella doing in a posh home like this?<eos> I don't know. I'll leave that one for you to work out. I'm going home.
I don't think she'd have listened.<eos> - He'd have had to...<eos> - He'd have what?<eos> Had to do something drastic to scare her of.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> And he wouldn't.<eos> Did you know he came into Gilswick yesterday in his van?<eos> OK.<eos> Poor thing, it's more scared of you.<eos> Now, this... is you doing 60... in a 40-mile-an-hour zone.
You've got that wrong.<eos> Well, Lizzie said you did.<eos> And I'm gonna take that at face value.<eos> Now, I suggest you went to Gilswick to have a little word with Alex.<eos> To tell her to back off, put the wind up her.<eos> Nah!<eos> Did Lizzie say this?<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> She's gone completely psycho since that Alex turned up.<eos> Well, you were very upset about all that, weren't you?

Confront Alex.
all night... ..in the barn.<eos> Mr. Monkford? Did your daughter drive?<eos> Only the pick-up.<eos> How did we miss it?<eos> The new lad checked all vehicles.<eos> It wasn't taxed or insured.<eos> And she lied about her whereabouts.<eos> Yeah, well, get back to the station.<eos> We'll need this written up.<eos> - You not coming?
And had his asthma always been problematic?<eos> No.<eos> He hardly used his inhaler before he went there.<eos> I don't know if it was the smoking or... hash or what. Whatever it was just exacerbated it but... It was in the middle of the night.<eos> By the time they'd found the key he was dead.<eos> And did Alex know what had happened to her brother?<eos> She knew what it had done to us.<eos> I don't think she could accept what we'd been dealt.<eos> Needed an explanation.<eos> Mrs. Gartside, did you accept the explanation of your son's death?
Does the name Simon Jenner mean anything to you?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Simon Jenner?<eos> Inmate at Farnworth?<eos> No.<eos> Well, your husband'll know, since he was in charge there at the time.<eos> Now, Alex Gartside was Simon Jenner's sister.<eos> And Martin was an inmate there too, same time.<eos> Well... I didn't know that. I've no idea.<eos> Now, the night Martin died, you told me that neither you nor your husband left the party.
I was just helping her with her studies.<eos> And all the while she was plotting to expose who you are.<eos> And then you turn up at hers... ..and the man who could ruin your life is sitting there.<eos> Martin Neilson couldn't ruin my life.<eos> He's a halfwit.<eos> Ah, well, was he a halfwit when he confirmed your story at Simon Jenner's inquest?<eos> He simply told the truth.<eos> Jenner died of an asthma attack.<eos> Read the report. I have, pet.<eos> You and Brian backing each other up.
Jenner died of an asthma attack.<eos> Read the report. I have, pet.<eos> You and Brian backing each other up.<eos> And the... halfwit going along with it.<eos> Cos you bullied him into it.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> You broke that lad's spirit.<eos> He was already broken.<eos> Most of 'em were.<eos> So why do you think they were there?
I had no idea Martin Neilson would be there.<eos> As soon as he saw me, he lost it.<eos> He had a bottle in his hand.<eos> Probably enjoying a beer.<eos> You're talking about an ex-offender here.<eos> Hm? A volatile ex-offender with a grudge.<eos> He flew at me.<eos> Totally unprovoked.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You're fit.
Probably enjoying a beer.<eos> You're talking about an ex-offender here.<eos> Hm? A volatile ex-offender with a grudge.<eos> He flew at me.<eos> Totally unprovoked.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You're fit.<eos> You're twice as strong as that man.<eos> You could've overpowered him easily.<eos> But you wanted to silence him.
She shouldn't have run away.<eos> So it was her fault, was it?<eos> Just another unhappy accident like what happened to her brother?<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Well, we'll never know, will we?<eos> Cos the only man who could say otherwise... ..has been killed by you.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> There's a weapon.<eos> Other side of that wall.<eos> - You all right?
- Are you all right?<eos> - I've only had two hours' kip.<eos> - Colic.<eos> - A fizzy drink will shift that.<eos> Not me, the baby.<eos> Kept me up all night.<eos> Well, talk to the fishermen, movements on Saturday night.<eos> Then meet me in the fish market.<eos> Get yourself a coffee.<eos> You're the detective in charge, aren't you?
I wouldn't believe any of the rumours you hear around here.<eos> You want to get that lot delivered, pet, while it's still fresh.<eos> Sr. Connock?<eos> Right. My turn, is it?<eos> I hear Tommy wasn't exactly on your Christmas card list.<eos> Yeah, I won't be shedding any tears, put it that way.<eos> Why do you think Tommy started the fire?<eos> I just know he did it, sure as you're stood there.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> What do you know that we didn't find?
- Zahra Suleiman?<eos> - What's she done?<eos> - I just need to talk to her.<eos> Is she in?<eos> She went out this morning as usual.<eos> - How long's she been here?<eos> - Been here a few months.<eos> Is she claiming benefits?<eos> Most of them are in this place.<eos> Looks like you're doing all right on it an' all.
I was walking past his room.<eos> A man.<eos> He was angry.<eos> What were they arguing about?<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> We keep to ourselves in this place.<eos> It's easier that way.<eos> Are you going to report me?<eos> That's not my department, love.<eos> But you have a care.
So what changed, hm?<eos> What happened to make him want to chuck it all in, vanish the way he did.<eos> In the weeks leading up to him disappearing... ..he became obsessed about how messed up the world was.<eos> Like reading the papers, watching the news all the time, going on about it.<eos> I tried to ask him about the boat but... ..he just seemed to care more about that than any of us.<eos> Will you take Ahmanuel for me?<eos> You go ahead, OK?<eos> Please, I've told you everything I know about Tommy already.<eos> That's nice.<eos> But with the greatest respect, love, I think you're spinning me a load of absolute claptrap.
You've connections with the scene.<eos> But I've no reason to kill him.<eos> I thought you blamed Tommy for your dad's death.<eos> So it could have been revenge.<eos> Or, you don't blame Tommy because you know the truth.<eos> Well, it looks like the fish market was in financial trouble long before Tommy started kicking off.<eos> Payday loans.<eos> Credit cards maxed out.<eos> Remortgaged to the ears.<eos> So did you or your brother burn the place down?

What?<eos> He can't stand the lass.<eos> He's been having a relationship with her for the last two years.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> Well, I knew he was seeing someone on the sly. I knew he was bringing someone to the hut, but I didn't...<eos> Well, you know what lads are like.<eos> We know Ellie Connock framed Tommy for the fish market fire.<eos> And we think your Jack went along with it.<eos> No...<eos> No, you're off your head, no.
And we think your Jack went along with it.<eos> No...<eos> No, you're off your head, no.<eos> Anyway, we believe they used your boat to dispose of Tommy's body and then torched it to cover their tracks.<eos> Which gives me a reason to charge your son as an accessory to murder.<eos> Well, I've got news for you.<eos> I set fire to the boat.<eos> It was nothing to do with him.<eos> Well, thanks for clarifying that for me, pet.<eos> But now I'm wondering what it is you've got to hide.
- So, which broker?<eos> - One in town.<eos> - Where?<eos> - On River Street.<eos> On River Street?<eos> Where Steve's wife works?<eos> When was this?<eos> When was it?<eos> Saturday.<eos> So you knew, when Steve was caught stalking his missus, he was on River Street the night his father died.
On River Street?<eos> Where Steve's wife works?<eos> When was this?<eos> When was it?<eos> Saturday.<eos> So you knew, when Steve was caught stalking his missus, he was on River Street the night his father died.<eos> And that there was every chance he'd bump into his old man on his way to sell off the family business.<eos> And that's why you torched the boat, to protect Steve.<eos> I promised my sister I'd look after them.<eos> What, even though it makes you an accessory to murder?
Anyhow, we rowed.<eos> So I got out of the van.<eos> If he hadn't have followed us... I had no intention of... I just...<eos> What, an unlucky punch?<eos> You pushed him?<eos> And his head hit the road.<eos> - What road was that?<eos> - Coast road.<eos> About half a mile inland.<eos> Believe me, pet, you won't be the first with an angry left hook that goes too far.
- We'll need ground tactical at the ready.<eos> You're coming?<eos> Good. With Mack on bed rest, we could use the extra muscle.<eos> Well, he's the only one with extra muscles, but I'll come anyway.<eos> We don't know what we're walking into.<eos> I already told you ...<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> This is happening.<eos> - There ... There she is.<eos> - And who are you, now?
- Great.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> That firenado really did a number on this car.<eos> I know someone we can call. Here.<eos> Take my phone.<eos> Look for Colton in the contact list.<eos> You're watching "Chicago Today," your number one news source for the Windy City. Hi.<eos> I'm Howard Beale.<eos> We're joined by Mayor Sandra Mansfield.<eos> Now, Mayor, you're saying the cause of all these sharknadoes is this man, Finley Allan Shepard.
You were a big help.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> Burt, I wanna go over a few things.<eos> Sure.<eos> Miss Rayburn.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You want me to go in there and tell them everything I know?<eos> Because I will.<eos> That look.<eos> What, you people really think you're the victims here?
She'll just think that I'm trying to break them up.<eos> - Aren't you?<eos> - No.<eos> But you're right; the messenger always gets shot.<eos> Karma over PA system: I want to apologize to everyone involved.<eos> I feel terrible about my actions.<eos> Having recently been humiliated myself, I understand how painful it can be.<eos> Take us through what happened.<eos> Details aren't really important.<eos> What I most want people to know is, I'm still that relaxed, carefree girl you all came to know and love this summer.
Then we'll go there.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I have something to talk about too.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh yeah!<eos> Adopt?<eos> I see you're very surprised.<eos> It's been a long time since you both came to stay.<eos> Now we're pretty much like family.<eos> And I'd like if you were like real siblings to Jung in the future.
Stay still.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Look at your face.<eos> How are you going to go to work tomorrow?<eos> You fought with Baek In Ho, didn't you?<eos> He started it.<eos> So did you just agree to it and fight him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two used to only fight with words, but now you're using your fists.
What good is it if your family is rich?<eos> Jung has no dreams and can't do anything he wants to do.<eos> That's why things are so easy for him.<eos> I might be the only person who understands him.<eos> He's a really pitiful guy.<eos> In any case, don't be nervous and put on a good performance.<eos> Fighting!<eos> Adopt?<eos> Now we're pretty much like family.<eos> And I'd like if you were like real siblings to Jung in the future.
Everyone who has agreed to participate in the flash mob, they have made peace, and they're okay with where they are.<eos> We're all about, you know, just being free, and we are here.<eos> We're here.<eos> We are Jamaicans.<eos> Um, okay, so are there people here who are not going to be dancing?<eos> Because we need some people on the side to hold some balloons.<eos> In roughly an hour, this crew is going to unleash their pride in the nation's capital.<eos> All right, come now.<eos> Okay.<eos> When I say "Jamaica," you say "Pride."

My father cut off my mother's head.<eos> My sister jailed me as a threat to her rule.<eos> - Lord Castleroy.<eos> - Greer, get back!<eos> You have been named by another suspect in the attempted murder of King Francis.<eos> He's in prison.<eos> He'll never be free again.<eos> We have crippling military debts.<eos> France is in debt to her soldiers who fought on Scotland's behalf.<eos> You and father executed 13 knights on the trumped-up charge of heresy. Simply because you couldn't pay them.
And Henry knew the chambermaid's story was a lie.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> The only thing Anne was ever guilty of was not having a son.<eos> You're Nancy, correct?<eos> Yes, I am, Your Highness.<eos> The night maid.<eos> The one who said she saw Queen Anne lay with her own brother George.<eos> Please, Highness, don't make me speak of that.<eos> Why?<eos> Was it too painful for you to condemn an innocent woman to death with your lies?

Begin!<eos> Come on, Narcisse. Get up.<eos> 10,000 livres at 50-to-one odds.<eos> You did it.<eos> All the money we need to pay off the army.<eos> How does it feel being the savior of France?<eos> Better than being him.<eos> Leave us.<eos> You might have told me about the three nights in jail before I agreed to your plan.<eos> And you might not have fumbled the pearls, and I wouldn't have had to spend the last three days convincing my privy council to let me pardon you.
He's just going to think I was home scrolling through all of his photos!<eos> Back-liking is so desperate! Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Enough with the spying and social media.<eos> Why don't you just go ask him how he feels about you?<eos> You mean have a conversation?<eos> I don't want to freak him out. Right.<eos> Let me get some clarity here.<eos> You guys are-are boyfriend and girlfriend...<eos> I love him. No, you don't, but that-that's fine.
You should try it, Sam.<eos> And just be straight with him. JEN: Yeah, guys love it when you're direct.<eos> Like when I told Greg his dream hat was stupid.<eos> (scoffs) The old lady doesn't understand sweet lids.<eos> Hey, just think, in 12 years, we're gonna be able<eos> - to help Lark like this. - JEN:<eos> Yeah, but I don't want to help her too much, you know? I want her to be able to learn<eos> - how to solve problems on her own.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever.
And you're paralyzed and slowly eaten alive.<eos> End of game.<eos> I've heard enough.<eos> Time for Barry to fix this.<eos> Where did he come from? He does that.<eos> Just go away.<eos> This is hopeless.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> The only problem is, you guys don't speak the same language.<eos> You speak lazy-eyed nerd, and, like me, you speak awesome, all-star athlete. Tater "T"?
- Henry...<eos> Benjamin...<eos> Ebenezer...<eos> Charlie?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Considering your experience as a farm manager, where do you stand on the new-model traction engines, Mr Woolford?<eos> - I'd never buy one, I know that.<eos> - Why would that be?<eos> I'd let some other fool take all the risk and rent one when I needed it.<eos> But the "other fool" may become a very rich man and you will be forever under obligation to him.

Pictures cannot harm you.<eos> - What do I do if they come again?<eos> - Let them come.<eos> We are men and they are pictures.<eos> Let them come.<eos> Gwen, it's you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Just a little something, ma'am.<eos> - A little something of what?<eos> For you and Mr Appleby, to help you get with child.
Abraham.<eos> Harrington.<eos> Benjamin.<eos> Your mother says you're afraid of leaving this farm.<eos> I give you my word, Charlie.<eos> For as long as I'm here, that will never happen.<eos> - I don't belong here.<eos> - Who said you don't belong here?<eos> I wanted to gather you together this morning with some exciting news.<eos> Well, I'm excited, and I very much hope you will be.
We can make it work, can't we? I love it here, we have to.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, what?<eos> - Yes, I think it's a brilliant idea.<eos> From this moment on, I am going to be the farm manager.<eos> 'Don't expect everyone to welcome these changes.'<eos> No good will come of this.<eos> I want your baby, Nathan Appleby.<eos> For you and Mr Appleby, to help you get with child.
What you been telling him?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Peter!<eos> You concocting a plan?<eos> To put me in a Bristol asylum?<eos> No.<eos> I've come to ask you if you poisoned the millpond.<eos> All the fish are dead.<eos> I... I didn't do anything.<eos> But you've come to accuse me and... and talk about me and discuss my...

I didn't do anything.<eos> But you've come to accuse me and... and talk about me and discuss my...<eos> Are you sure you saw them?<eos> Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you, too.<eos> - Maybe you're hallucinating.
What did you mean?<eos> Mr Appleby, is it wise to pursue this?<eos> - Why wouldn't it be wise?<eos> - There's talk in the village.<eos> I hear things the children say.<eos> - Things their parents have said about...<eos> What do they say about me?<eos> They say you're raising the dead.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you're a good and decent man, Mr Appleby.
You came here to find Alice.<eos> - No.<eos> - Martha, I don't understand.<eos> You saw her face, the way she looked at me.<eos> - Please, Mr Appleby, let her be.<eos> Please.<eos> - Why?<eos> - She hates me, despises me.<eos> - Listen to me, Martha.<eos> Your friend looked traumatised, the same way you did when you arrived at Shepzoy.
The future of farming... or so I'm told.<eos> - I might have been misinformed.<eos> - Beware the farmers' market.<eos> You're more likely to find an honest broker at the door of a Turkish bordello.<eos> Unfortunately, this isn't a social call.<eos> I have a favour to ask of you.<eos> Someone, and we believe we know who, has sabotaged our wagons.<eos> I cannot get my produce to market.<eos> And the wholesale price of grain is falling even as we speak.<eos> Might it be possible for you to spare us two or three wagons so that I might...
She's one of my workers.<eos> William Payne, the new proprietor of Marshfield Estate.<eos> What happened?<eos> I need your assistance, Mr Payne.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> This young woman was murdered in Elmwood Forest.<eos> The man I believe responsible, Jack Langtree, is still there.<eos> He's living in the cave at the Devil's Chapel.<eos> Your men will know where that is.<eos> I need you and your men to go up there and apprehend Langtree.
We saw her as clearly as we can see you.<eos> Martha?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr Appleby.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't see Alice in the woods today.<eos> Perhaps you imagined it.<eos> What the hell... .. are you playing at?<eos> - You're frightening me, Mr Appleby. - Dammit!<eos> You saw her!
Open the door, please.<eos> Martha, I want to speak to you.<eos> Please, I'm fine.<eos> I don't want to talk.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just want to be on my own.<eos> I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> If he wasn't guilty of Alice's murder, then why did he run?<eos> The Language Of Flowers.<eos> I don't believe Nathan saw Alice's ghost in the woods, but he did see something, and whatever he saw, or thinks he saw, you saw it too, and when you denied this, you were lying.
O my love is like a red, red rose... .. that's newly sprung in June...<eos> "O my love's like the melody, That's sweetly played in tune."<eos> As fair art thou, my bonny lass...<eos> "So deep in love am I..."<eos> "And I will love thee still, my dear,<eos> "Till all the sea's gone dry.<eos> "To my secret flower of the forest.<eos> "From Martha."<eos> I loved her.<eos> The way you love your husband.
In all your years of dealing with the dead and the dying and the bereaved, have you ever seen anything that you could not explain?<eos> Never.<eos> Are you there?<eos> Are you with me?<eos> Gabriel drew a picture of a woman with a book and so did Harriet.<eos> If you're suggesting that my pursuit of the truth is in relation to Gabriel...<eos> Only you can answer that.
Why don't we get away to London for a few days, just us?<eos> No, we can't leave.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Why not?<eos> The harvest is sold, we can see friends and visit the theatre and galleries, it'd be like a tonic.<eos> Just a few days, that's all I'm asking, and then we can return rested and clear-headed.<eos> Please, please.<eos> For me.<eos> Very well.<eos> That you'd use my daughter to commune with the dead!
Leslie Tannen.<eos> She was the admitting nurse at Meridian Terrace during that time.<eos> She'll confirm.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Susan Ross.<eos> Who's the real father? Is he around?<eos> Mm.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Fen-phen or Vioxx, Raptiva.<eos> There's no evidence the HIB vaccine has any negative side effects.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Kids get the vaccine when they're babies.<eos> Who knows what the long-term effects will be?<eos> For Shiloh's long-term health and happiness, we'll risk a treatable childhood illness.<eos> So no child should be vaccinated, right?<eos> You want your kids in a school where no one's protected from polio, smallpox.<eos> - Will, enough.<eos> - No. You trot out this pseudoscience, but what you really want is for every other kid to be vaccinated so yours can be safe.
You all served him well, and I look forward to continuing the work you began together, as we navigate our way through this difficult time.<eos> I'll need all of your help getting up to speed, but first, I'll need to speak to Captain Chandler.<eos> St. Louis connected, sir.<eos> This is Captain Chandler.<eos> Stand by for the President.<eos> Captain Chandler.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I am so very sorry.<eos> I know how close you and Jeffrey were.<eos> I hope that over time, I can earn the trust and confidence that you and he shared.
Hurry, Dennis.<eos> We need to fix this.<eos> Please.<eos> How you holding up over there?<eos> Alisha...<eos> I'm the one who found Michener.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Kara.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're over there risking your lives.
What do you want to know?<eos> Honestly...<eos> I really want to know if you'd be willing to see an actual therapist.<eos> No.<eos> What for?<eos> What for?<eos> You were shot, you suffered trauma, much of it unseen.<eos> Am I ringing any bells here?<eos> We agreed I don't need therapy.<eos> Uh, no, you agreed.
So it's a... It's a piece of art, so to say. Heinonen:<eos> Iranians are very proud of their centrifuges.<eos> They have a lot of public relations videos given up always in April when they have what they call a national nuclear day.<eos> Kiyaei:<eos> Ahmadinejad came into his presidency saying if the international community wants to derail us we will stand up to it.<eos> If they want us to sign more inspections and more additional protocols and other measures, no, we will not.<eos> We will fight for our rights.<eos> Iran is a signature to nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and under that treaty, Iran has a right to a nuclear program.<eos> We can have enrichment.<eos> Who are you, world powers, to come and tell us that we cannot have enrichment?
President Bush once said to me, he said,<eos> "Mike, I don't want any president ever to be faced with only two options, bombing or the bomb."<eos> Right? He...<eos> He wanted options that...<eos> That made it...<eos> Made it far less likely he or his successor or successors would ever get to that point where that's... That's all you've got.<eos> We wanted to be energetic enough in pursuing this problem that... that the Israelis would certainly believe,<eos> "Yeah, we get it."<eos> The intelligence cooperation between Israel and the United States is very, very good.<eos> And therefore, the Israelis went to the Americans and said, "Okay, guys, you don't want us to bomb Iran.
Secrecy is still justifiable in certain cases to protect sources or to protect national security but when we deal with secrecy, don't hide behind it to use as an excuse to not disclose something properly that you know should be<eos> or that the American people need ultimately to see.<eos> While most government officials refused to acknowledge the operation, at least one key insider did leak parts of the story to the press.<eos> In 2012, David Sanger wrote a detailed account of Olympic Games that unmasked the extensive joint operation between the U.S. and Israel to launch cyber attacks on Natanz.<eos> Sanger:<eos> Gibney:<eos> In... into the press and into the leaks?<eos> Into the press and into the leaks.<eos> Soon after the article, the Obama administration targeted<eos> There are reports of cyber attacks on the Iranian nuclear program that you ordered.
It was late and there was scotch.<eos> Lorelai, stop talking.<eos> - I didn't mean to--<eos> Don't follow.<eos> Mom... Please, come back.<eos> I didn't do it on purpose.<eos> I had a brain freeze.<eos> I panicked.<eos> Mom.<eos> - You two start with the silver.
-Oh, Mom...<eos> I don't know what to do or where to go.<eos> I've forgotten which side of the bed to sleep on.<eos> I was married for 50 years.<eos> Half of me is gone.<eos> Ah, you don't understand.<eos> -I understand.<eos> -You can't understand. You're not married.<eos> -Luke and I are as good as married.<eos> -No, you're roommates.
-You're kidding.<eos> -I know I'm not their highest priority, but Condé Nast asked for this meeting. Months ago.<eos> This came from them.<eos> Condé Nast?<eos> Procrastinators supreme. May I?<eos> Help yourself.<eos> How you doing, Rory?<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> It's been a very long time.<eos> I didn't know you two were still in touch.
- Your permit?<eos> - Uh, is there a list?<eos> I'd be on it.<eos> There is no list.<eos> How do you keep track of everyone?<eos> - We look at your permit.<eos> - Well, I have a permit.<eos> I showed it to your friend yesterday, and I can prove it.<eos> He stood here and gave a speech about how we were gonna die because of the weather.<eos> He said, "You all have permits, so you can go, but you shouldn't." - Good speech.

Umbrellas, furniture springs, buggy whips, toys, collar stays, springs in early typewriters, curtain pulls, dog collars, back scratchers, bicycle spokes, hairpins, toothpicks, flag poles...<eos> Rory, it's your grandmother.<eos> I am so sorry to have missed your call.<eos> Yes, I am in Nantucket, and yes, the house is empty, and yes, it is all yours.<eos> Berta and the family are with me, but there are fresh sheets on the bed in the guest room, and there's some wonderful dishes in the freezer.<eos> I have no idea what they are or what's in them, but Berta made them and they are divine.<eos> Call if you need anything.<eos> ...we have with Lorelai and Rory?<eos> She knows what time we dine.<eos> Why are you eating so... - quickly?

You are going to accept.<eos> The Vatican wants something.<eos> They want me to accept Elizabeth's offer, and then when I am named her successor, your queen will be assassinated, and I will take her throne.<eos> I'm just a pawn, even if I were assassinated, they'd just replace me with the next Catholic in line.<eos> A man would be their preference.<eos> I have named Queen Mary Stuart as my successor in exchange for choosing her next husband, and I choose you.<eos> It's the Red Knights.<eos> Catherine, watch out!<eos> "Your debt will be paid."<eos> You and Father executed 13 knights on the trumped up charge of heresy, simply because you couldn't pay them?

Can you give me any details about these men that might reveal their identities?<eos> Highborn?<eos> Lowborn?<eos> One man wore a ruby ring.<eos> He said he'd give it to me if I'd join their cause.<eos> You've been threatening Catherine de Medici from afar, claiming to be the Red Knights.<eos> Well, now you're going to face the woman herself.<eos> After Mary's nuptials to Robert Dudley, will you be inviting her to English court?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> The more time I spend by your side, the more I think you two might get on.
Knowing they're alive.<eos> But you can not have them.<eos> I don't care if the queen of England agreed to a prisoner exchange.<eos> Gideon Blackburn is an enemy of the Church, and he must be punished.<eos> Have you been to England, Archbishop Ridolfi?<eos> Everything's damp, the food's wretched.<eos> Trust me when I say, he will be in his own hell.<eos> I don't think you appreciate how upset the Vatican is over this.<eos> This monarchy is under attack by a group, who I suspect turned one of your own, Cardinal Morel.<eos> So you can understand, why I took the opportunity to get one of my most loyal generals back to France... a Catholic country, that you and I and Pope Pius all care for greatly.
I have a mind of my own.<eos> One that leads me to wonder about things, like your true intentions for Mary, Queen of Scots.<eos> If you were just using her as a puppet.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I find it hard to believe that Joseph Tudor acted alone.<eos> Makes perfect sense that you wanted Elizabeth unseated, and that it would be easy to dupe that poor fool, Mary, into thinking the Vatican truly wanted her to rule England.<eos> Poor fool?<eos> You've always spoken quite highly of her.<eos> She lost her husband and her country.<eos> Her guard was down, and you took advantage of it.
From where I sit, which is on the French throne as its regent, I see the Vatican pushing around female monarchs, and I don't appreciate it one bit.<eos> You can go now.<eos> It is a great pleasure.<eos> It was the least I could do.<eos> Lord Narcisse.<eos> A word.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> To what do I owe this pleasure?<eos> Do you have more false accusations of treason to hurl my way?<eos> On the contrary, I have come to realize that you were not behind the accusation that I poisoned Francis, or behind the recent appearance of the Red Knights.
I don't know.<eos> We don't want this.<eos> This is a disaster for us.<eos> For you?<eos> - No, I meant if you think...<eos> - Look...<eos> This is pretty good for you, actually.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> He goes to Africa all the time.<eos> But now, all of a sudden, when you're so worried that he knows your secret, he disappears?
Paige, that's crazy.<eos> What?<eos> Do you think we kidnap people and what?<eos> - That we kill them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I-I mean, in a Russian-controlled military country, he disappears?<eos> That doesn't sound that crazy to me.<eos> Well, it's not true.<eos> But how am I supposed to know?<eos> I mean, even if it were, that's what you'd say, right?
- Sarah, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nothing. It's just...<eos> I haven't been telling you the truth.<eos> My husband, the night I found you was the same night he died<eos> That's why I laid out the second plate. I...<eos> I wanted to feel his presence.<eos> - Do you mind my ask...<eos> - Shot by thieves.<eos> Just like you were.
If any man can show just cause why they may not be lawfully joined together, then let him now speak or forever hold his peace.<eos> I object.<eos> What?<eos> As a friend I've tried to hold my tongue, but as a magistrate I can no longer allow this marriage to proceed.<eos> No, no, Richard, you've gone too far this time.<eos> Captain, take this man and put him in the bloody stockades.<eos> Hear me out and you may wish to put your bride there instead.<eos> The divorce papers she submitted from Connecticut are false.<eos> She forged the signatures and I have taxation records from Selah Strong to prove it.<eos> Please, you are welcome to examine them.
I will guarantee sales of 30,000 vehicles sold through our dealerships.<eos> I mean, as of now, it's only a design.<eos> There's no prototype.<eos> Not yet, but I will make you a preferred supplier.<eos> The servi-cars will be sold as Ford vehicles with the Ford name on the side.<eos> Gentlemen, that is my proposal.<eos> The motorcycle industry is, I'm afraid, up against the ropes.<eos> This may help prevent Harley-Davidson from joining its former competitors.<eos> - Who pays for development?<eos> - You do.
L... let me guess... the lake?<eos> No.<eos> No, I was, uh...<eos> A picnic... I was at a picnic.<eos> - A picnic?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Ford is ready for you now.<eos> As per our previous meeting, Harley-Davidson will finance the development of the servi-car while complying to Ford's high standards of design and manufacturing.<eos> Of course, you own the design and the machinery.
Yes?<eos> I'm Jessica Turing.<eos> I believe you and I are in love with the same man.<eos> Uh...<eos> Jessica...<eos> Andrew is deeply devoted to you.<eos> Normally I wouldn't doubt that, but things have changed since Andrew's visit here a few weeks ago.<eos> He's working late a lot.<eos> Isn't interested in discussing the final details of our wedding.<eos> I've noticed the two of you talk more than you ever have over text and e-mail.
After four years, can I still sing?<eos> Well, I'm sure you can still sing, of course.<eos> If not, you would never attempt to do this concert.<eos> Well, people do foolish things.<eos> Perhaps I can still sing in my shower.<eos> No?<eos> But everyone believes they are a great singer in the shower.<eos> I was sorry to hear about your orchestra. - Mm.<eos> - I admire what you're trying to do to bring--<eos> How you like to say?
I couldn't agree more.<eos> And some people should not be allowed to conduct.<eos> I hope you're not referring to me, Wolfgang.<eos> Well, I'm not referring to myself.<eos> Is that the way you're gonna be?<eos> Why? Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why after so many years, you're still like a spoiled brat?<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you always have to smell your own farts?
No, Axl, no!<eos> I told you if you're gonna be here, you got to keep your crap in your room away from the rest of our crap.<eos> And when are you gonna find your own place, anyway?<eos> I want you out of here.<eos> Actually, I'm moving out today. - Aw!<eos> - Yep. Savor your last moments with me 'cause after today, I'm dust.<eos> Hutch and I landed ourselves a sweet new pad, which we're totally stoked about.<eos> Why, there's my house now.<eos> Brilliant, isn't it?<eos> While you suckers are stuck here throwing money away on this pit, we are taking a mobile house party wherever we go.
It was so hard on him.<eos> Booze, pills, and then even harder stuff.<eos> His father and brothers tried, but I nursed him through it, helped him find a therapist.<eos> It sounds like you really saved him.<eos> This came last week.<eos> He got into the police academy.<eos> To report next month.<eos> Terry, he... he didn't even mention he took the exam.<eos> Maybe he was too proud to tell you until it was official.<eos> One thing I know, he really looked up to you, said you went through a lot of the same things.
You're still thinking about the case, aren't you?<eos> No, no...<eos> Tim, we've talked about this.<eos> If we don't leave work at work, then it's work 24-7.<eos> And then there's nothing for us.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, so then... just push the case out of your mind until it stays out.<eos> Please?<eos> And eat.<eos> I did not spend two hours making you dinner for you to stare at it.
just happened to have been a guard at the...<eos> North Brook Detention Center.<eos> Same time you were there.<eos> So?<eos> You told us you'd never seen him before.<eos> (sighs) If I did, I don't remember.<eos> He brought you your meals every day for eight months.<eos> Grafton had a record for drug trafficking.<eos> You were serving time for drug dealing.<eos> Here you are, years later, still buddies.

We intercepted your e-mail.<eos> So, what comes now?<eos> You deny my citizenship application and you send me back to Libya?<eos> I'm not in favor of that, but shortly you're gonna be meeting some people who are.<eos> I can't protect you if you won't cooperate.<eos> Please, why can't you just leave me alone?<eos> Are you familiar with the oath you're planning to take tomorrow?<eos> I'm not vowing to take action against innocent people.<eos> For all I know you're going to drone strike her village.<eos> You're going to raid her home, kill her, call it collateral damage.
- Please.<eos> - Give me the Darkspore.<eos> - When you're dying, and you're bleeding out wishing you'd done things differently, I want you to remember this moment, when I gave you one last chance to walk away.<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> We're not here to kill you, we just want the Darkspore.<eos> - Yes, we will kill you, unless you give us what we want.<eos> - Yeah, like the lady says.<eos> - Hm, you've mistakenly robbed The infamous Admiral Borlund Hess.<eos> This is my wagon, my women, my Darkspore, and you squandered your one last opportunity to walk away.<eos> - Yes, we know, you're smart, powerful, we're going to regret it, but this is our wagon now, and it's time for you to leave.
I look at it as a place to recover.<eos> A place that I can just have myself back.<eos> I can have my life back.<eos> It feels great on my body, and I'm up really high, and it kind of reminds me of when I used to fly.<eos> Unfortunately, the fallout from this is that it's hard on all your relationships.<eos> I don't see anybody nearly as much as I used to.<eos> I feel like I let my family down, 'cause I was always there for them before.<eos> So, I miss my friends and my family, and, honestly, you shouldn't have to leave the country to not be exposed to this stuff.<eos> "Wireless refugee" is a common term in Green Bank.<eos> [narrator] While you're looking for more bars,
"I really miss you.<eos> Please just, like, talk to me."<eos> I was just so excited to hear from him.<eos> And kind of at that point, it was like I kind of knew that I had been taken in by a cult, and that I didn't make that decision rationally.<eos> You know, I was like, "You know what? I'm gonna give my parents another shot.<eos> I'm gonna try this again."<eos> [narrator] With their digital reconnection came a very analog reunion.<eos> But they've never talked about Marisa's deFOOing until now.<eos> When me and Jackie had you guys, we swore we were going to be the best parents in the world, you know?<eos> We tried so hard, and, you know, I think you've learned a lot, and I'm sure when you have a family, you know, you'll make your mistakes, but I think you'll do a lot better than me and your Mom did.

Staller's inside.<eos> Got here just after I did.<eos> His skinny jeans make the odds of a concealed firearm quite slim.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> How'd it go with Fiona?<eos> We'll discuss it later.<eos> Whoa, you guys have the wrong idea.<eos> I don't know anything about a murder.<eos> You'd be surprised how many confessions start that way.<eos> All right, you think I was mad because The Keep was a fraud.
Previously on "Salem"...<eos> The terror outside drives refugees into Salem, where soon they all, including my dear father, will be with the burning candles that ignite my inauguration.<eos> Serve him in the most minimal of ways, and he will allow you and my sister to live happily ever after.
Herbs!<eos> Fresh herbs!<eos> Cotton.<eos> I have just spoken with the Baron Von Marburg.<eos> He has made clear to me the policy he wishes... that we remain open to those desperate arrivals... and he and the Sibley fortune will back it.<eos> But now, with this latest atrocity, the temperament among the people is running very high.<eos> I fear they may demand swift and harsh measures.<eos> There is even talk about gathering an armed mob to drive the refugees back into the forest.<eos> Why, they wouldn't!<eos> I need you, at the inn tonight, to discuss the matter with the Selectmen.
Yes.<eos> Though I prefer, "Loki, Prince of Mischief,<eos> "and rightful heir to the throne of Asgard"<eos> to "dude."<eos> What do you want with us, dude?<eos> You have quite a large mouth for such a puny creature.<eos> But the truth is, the two of you mean nothing to me.<eos> I planted the Destroyer Armor for the CryptoCube's owner to find so that I could keep track of the Cosmic Seed.<eos> Now, I need to be sure such a powerful item doesn't fall into the hands of mere mortals.<eos> So, what do you know of the Cosmic Seed?
You look more like a rabid, feral, disease-infested space vermin.<eos> But that's just my opinion.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I got your opinion right here.<eos> (GROANS) Oh, apparently you're clumsy.<eos> Again, just my opinion.<eos> Now, what do we have here worth confiscating?<eos> Don't touch that!<eos> It's a pocket dimension storage vial!<eos> You tourists know the penalty for defiling the image of King J'Son?
ROCKET: Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> That's it.<eos> The last thing the helmet recorded.<eos> If we're gonna find Quill, looks like we need to find her first.<eos> (ALL GASP) You!<eos> What have you done with Quill?<eos> Who?<eos> ROCKET: Peter Quill.<eos> Tall, hairless, ugly, usually calls himself "Star-Lord."<eos> Ah, so you are the friends of the Star-Lord.
Can't believe I'm doing this.<eos> You must be true friends of the Star-Lord.<eos> By virtue of belief, you have survived the tests.<eos> DRAX: We survived thanks to our skills and teamwork.<eos> If she wants to believe that malarkey, let her.<eos> We gotta find Quill and get outta here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How did you get down here?<eos> We are here to free the Star-Lord.<eos> I believe you will give me the key, and leave us.
The king is not receiving visitors.<eos> I believe you will let me pass!<eos> I am Groot?<eos> Nobody's home.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> They don't look like they believe you.<eos> You do not need your weapons.<eos> The power of belief will protect you.<eos> You are the mighty Star-Lord of prophecy, destined to rescue us from tyranny.

This Star-Lord dares to defy me.<eos> I would have his head.<eos> He has the CryptoCube and is the only one who can use it.<eos> We need him to find the Cosmic Seed.<eos> Then he will remain alive only so long as he is useful.<eos> Once Star-Lord finds the Cosmic Seed, you will deliver them both to me.<eos> Hey, you missed a spot.<eos> (MUTTERING) You heard the Star-Lord.<eos> Put your backs into it!<eos> You maggots act like ya never seen soap and water in your pathetic, worthless lives!
Meanwhile, I'm gonna speed things along so this baby blows before it gets too close to the Kree fleet.<eos> Quickly, the last door is just ahead.<eos> Whatever you are planning, you will fail.<eos> Continue with your task. I will deal with Ronan.<eos> You still seek revenge, Destroyer.<eos> The futility of your quest must be obvious, even to one as thick-headed as you.<eos> I do not need to defeat you.<eos> I must merely withstand your attacks.<eos> Then withstand this.<eos> When I say Spartax, you say Star-Lord!
I know, honey.<eos> Finally... a real human being I can talk to.<eos> Wait. Why is Milkshake here?<eos> He's my plus-one.<eos> You don't get a plus-one.<eos> You're my plus-one.<eos> You really don't know how weddings work, do you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> You two get the gift.
ROMAN: So you're saying she's a... [Russian word]<eos> - JEREMY:<eos> A witch?<eos> - Yes. And they don't want to be discovered either.<eos> Way to go, Bucky.<eos> Freddie, no more counterfeiting.<eos> FREDDIE: Let's say... I disagree. [Clang]<eos> BUCKY: No, we work for you, now.<eos> We're Pack. All the way.<eos> I call, and you do exactly what I tell you to do.
Well, Just Karen, why don't you just call me Just Jeremy?<eos> I hope it's happy news. It's good.<eos> Yeah, it was my decision.<eos> I came to Bear Valley looking for a quieter life, and after last year, I realized I was not going to get it being a cop.<eos> I can understand the appeal of a quieter life.<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> Very relaxed.<eos> Sure don't miss the uniform.<eos> No, this is much better.<eos> You artists know how to embellish.
Yes, of course. It's just that I'm on the way out.<eos> So am I. My ship leaves for England tomorrow morning.<eos> I see your bloodhound Captain Simcoe has not made you aware of this, likely because he intends to see me off in his own way.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, you should be.<eos> Afraid, that is, of what you don't know.<eos> Take, for instance, the rebel spy that has been operating right under your nose.<eos> May I?<eos> I know all about that.<eos> My bloodhound, as you call him, is out hunting for Robert Rogers as we speak.
I knew this would happen, damn it.<eos> Aw, that was too high.<eos> Aim lower and give the cheeky buggers a scare.<eos> Wake me if they don't scarper.<eos> And what about us, Jameson?<eos> What's the reward for tipping you off?<eos> You did your duty, Paulding.<eos> Your country thanks you.<eos> Good thing we was here, then.<eos> An enemy vessel creeping up and you asleep on the watch.
You have the magistrate's word on it.<eos> And you have mine.<eos> Captain, would you mind telling me what Elias Appleby was doing here after you torched his entire harvest of hay and slaughtered his livestock?<eos> Why, to thank me, of course.<eos> As so many have for my efforts to drive the wicked elements from Setauket.<eos> Though I suppose they should really be thanking you.<eos> If I had known what you were going to do with the names I provided, I never would have given them.<eos> I would have taken them all the same.<eos> Your pointless hunt for Rogers is tearing this town apart.<eos> He is long gone and you are stoking the fires of rebellion in his absence.
Simcoe's time will come, but you need to wait.<eos> Wait?<eos> Wait for what?<eos> That's been your answer, hasn't it, your whole life.<eos> Wait.<eos> This town looks to you as a leader, not to me.<eos> So lead them.<eos> Speak up and do the right thing.<eos> How terribly uncouth.<eos> But it'd be more uncouth still for you to not drink his health, Captain.
- I'm sorry about, you know...<eos> - Me too.<eos> Now get back to work.<eos> When they're done, they'll leapfrog to the next OR.<eos> Okay, let's do this, Mrs. Carranza.<eos> Uh, Cheeks, pass me the yurr... - Ugh.<eos> - Yttrium.<eos> Yeah, that.<eos> I'll be on the implant team, along with Jesse, and we'll inject the microspheres.<eos> Millicent and Marty, you're up.
That area has a high crime rate, 115% higher than the national average.<eos> Yeah, it's known for its drug usage.<eos> And from the track marks on our victims' arms, it's apparent they were familiar with the needle.<eos> So this could be a drug deal gone wrong or an angry pimp.<eos> And given the surroundings, it's possible these two worked as prostitutes.<eos> We should also consider that he's a moral enforcer.<eos> He could be a vigilante trying to clean up the streets.<eos> And Oak Park would be a target rich environment for him.<eos> All right, when we land, JJ, meet Rossi at the crime scene.<eos> You two go to the M.E., and I'll get us set up at the precinct.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> You're going to be all right.<eos> Everything is going to be all right. I'll save you.<eos> FBI!<eos> Joseph Berzon, step away from Danielle.<eos> No! Stay away!<eos> Joseph, look at her.<eos> She needs help.<eos> I'm the only one who can give it to her.<eos> You don't understand her.
Me.<eos> This is murder. Stand back, old man, or I'll see you up this tree as well.<eos> I am magistrate of this town, Captain, charged with upholding the rights of the king's subjects.<eos> And those rights state that no man shall be condemned without trial.<eos> Falkoff.<eos> Justice may only be delivered by the just.<eos> Perhaps what this town needs is a new magistrate.<eos> I stand only for the law, nothing more.<eos> If my son has committed crimes, let him stand trial for them.<eos> - A trial where you sit as judge?
Oh, they have put... oh, they have put them on me!<eos> Madam! Madam! - They have put them on me!<eos> - It's all right, madam.<eos> It's all right.<eos> To the bed.<eos> To the bed.<eos> - Only Washington can take them away.<eos> - Shh. - Only Washington!<eos> - I'm here.<eos> Peggy: No, you are not Washington.
Madam! Madam! - They have put them on me!<eos> - It's all right, madam.<eos> It's all right.<eos> To the bed.<eos> To the bed.<eos> - Only Washington can take them away.<eos> - Shh. - Only Washington!<eos> - I'm here.<eos> Peggy: No, you are not Washington.<eos> You are the man in the fire.
- Well, I...<eos> - Sort through. See if there is post intended for me since I am standing right here.<eos> Just cut through the red tape, man.<eos> He's going to try André as a spy.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> He is an officer.<eos> He proposes an exchange.<eos> For prisoners?<eos> For you.<eos> He writes since you are the author of this mischief, you ought more properly to be the victim.
He does not meet the status of a spy according to the "Laws and Ordinance of War."<eos> The board has studied the letters of General Arnold and Sir Clinton and have determined that there was no valid flag of truce.<eos> Furthermore, Major André was travelling in disguised habit and under an assumed name.<eos> He carried with him incriminating papers given to him by a known traitor.<eos> The recommendation of this tribunal is that Major André ought to be considered a spy from the enemy and that, agreeable to the law and usage of nations, it is our opinion that he suffer death.<eos> Sir, the board did not speak to the manner of his execution.<eos> Yes, they left that to my discretion and it remains complicated.<eos> This arrived inside a packet from Sir Clinton.<eos> It is written from Arnold to me threatening retaliation to American prisoners under their power.<eos> "Should this warning be disregarded... I shall call upon heaven and earth to witness... you will be accountable for the torrent of blood that may be spilled in consequence."
It is written from Arnold to me threatening retaliation to American prisoners under their power.<eos> "Should this warning be disregarded... I shall call upon heaven and earth to witness... you will be accountable for the torrent of blood that may be spilled in consequence."<eos> Sir, my apologies.<eos> My house servant and her boy seem to have gone off without leave.<eos> "A torrent of blood"?<eos> Did you threaten to slaughter 40 hostages if Washington harms André?<eos> Washington seeks my ruin.<eos> He threatened first when he offered the trade.<eos> I meant to make our position clear.<eos> Our position? We do not murder prisoners of war and you do not speak for the king, ever.
Man: Turncoat...<eos> Mr. Rivington.<eos> Brigadier General Benedict Arnold at your service, sir.<eos> I wish to publish a proclamation, "To the Inhabitants of America."<eos> Can you afford the space, sir?<eos> That is, after all the ink you purchased to publish your exoneration by the American court.<eos> I can afford that and more.<eos> Drink.<eos> Whatever's cheapest.<eos> Here you are, sir.
Have Cavil and Pierce post hunting blinds, one on the north tree line and one in the horse stable.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Don't worry, you'll hardly know they're there.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> Didn't you hear Abe?<eos> Rogers will come for us and Thomas, too.<eos> Your son is safe at Whitehall.<eos> If you wish to join him there, you're welcome.<eos> Your husband shall remain here.<eos> As you say, you're already dead.
- He threatened your son.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just last week.<eos> Now, Thomas is with Aberdeen.<eos> I want you to take him and flee at your first chance.<eos> I know the tale that you and Abe spun about Rogers is a lie.<eos> Then you know if I flee with Thomas, Abe will be exposed.<eos> The truth will come to light on its own.<eos> And when it does, you do not want Thomas anywhere near here.<eos> You may be able to stand by and watch Abe's demise, but I cannot.
You know, h-he wanted to. I could hardly tell him that he couldn't come back to his own home.<eos> He's gonna continue with therapy like three times a week, so it's a lot.<eos> And he... he's on meds for his blackouts.<eos> I think he's doing much better. All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, I guess you just... you have to do what you have to do.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Romero still there?<eos> He moved out.<eos> You... you haven't told Norman about him yet.
I promised Updike his gin.<eos> Dr. Masters and I have had a bit of a situation with Bob Drag.<eos> As you know, our first book, it was a best-seller, created a huge following...<eos> So huge, in fact, Hugh Hefner has just come on board as an investor...<eos> Mrs. Johnson, is this a... Is this a sales pitch?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is about...<eos> This is about Drag.<eos> I fear that he may have poisoned the well here at Little Brown.<eos> Well, it seems to me that you two did that to yourselves. Didn't you?
Look, why... why don't I come down?<eos> Oh, that's okay. I'm fine.<eos> Well, it's nerve-racking being alone.<eos> I'm not exactly alone.<eos> Well, not for long.<eos> For all of her powers of intuition, I know my Helen a lot better than she knows herself, and no matter what she says, I can hear it in her voice, so I'm gonna call 'em.<eos> I'm gonna call her folks.<eos> We will eventually meet with Masters and Johnson, won't we?<eos> Of course, Mr. Clavermore.<eos> As soon as they return, well, unless you wish to continue the process with us.
- His name's Jim Miller.<eos> Killed his grand-parents, brother-in-law, then anyone he was paid to.<eos> Called him Killer Miller.<eos> I remember.<eos> Rumor has it was Miller, not Robert Ford, who put down Jesse James.<eos> Well, Robert Ford was an awful shot.<eos> It was always said, Miller moved like a shadow.<eos> Now he is one.<eos> Shadow assassin who can only be activated via blood sacrifice.<eos> You outlaws sure have gotten dramatic since you were human.
It's tough for her... being the youngest?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was 4 when Mama left.<eos> - She just up and moved away.<eos> - Maybe it runs in the family.<eos> Anyways, you got a good look at the thief at Waverly's?<eos> Better yet, a shot?<eos> Yeah, I did, but he was better.<eos> Better than what?<eos> You two look around the homestead.
Yes, we use this in about 80% of our cases.<eos> We even have an ECT technician as a full-time member of our staff.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Yes, we've turned it into an in-house procedure.<eos> So shall we get started?<eos> - Started?<eos> - Electroshock therapy?<eos> Goodness, this is a lot for us to digest.<eos> So much so that maybe it would be better if we came back another day.<eos> Well, what would be best is if you told the truth.
In which case, I should remind you that the commissioner of police does sit on our board.<eos> So maybe I should just call him, see if he knows anything about this.<eos> We're therapists.<eos> Sex thera-- we want to be sex therapists.<eos> We want to open our own clinic.<eos> Shame on you for lying.<eos> No, please, take it as a compliment.<eos> We are so impressed by your work.<eos> We're just trying to do as much research as possible, see how other therapists do it.<eos> And you are by far the best, although we are talking to all the others.
Go ahead.<eos> M-may I call you Earl?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Ingrid?<eos> We don't like to be too formal.<eos> We've found a truly immersive approach yields the best results.<eos> By taking time out from your daily lives, you're... you're making your sexual relationship a priority.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Mm-hmm. - an opportunity to relax and explore and fall in love all over again.<eos> And-and you treat couples together, a-as a couple?
Can you imagine the business you'd do if this were in New York or Philadelphia?<eos> I've said the same thing to Art a dozen times, haven't I, Art?<eos> Uh, she has.<eos> Do you know that right now, Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson are on the road investigating a pair of charlatan therapists who claim to be using our method?<eos> There are clinics popping up everywhere.<eos> I just... I keep saying to Art,<eos> "Shouldn't it be us opening one?"<eos> After all, we've been properly trained and endorsed by Masters and Johnson themselves.<eos> It's a terrific scheme:<eos> you two take the Masters and Johnson method to the masses.
I thought it would just be Bill and me.<eos> Well, actually, I have decided to oversee the case myself. Really?<eos> I will be conducting an intake with you this morning, and then a separate intake tomorrow with Mom... uh, Mrs. Eshelman.<eos> You're not gonna call her that, are you?<eos> Let's start by discussing the issues that brought you to treatment.<eos> Well, um... your mother and I haven't really had...<eos> You don't have to say, "Your mother."<eos> Uh, Edna and I haven't had sex in years, and, uh, we haven't had good sex in...<eos> God, I don't even know.<eos> Was there a particular time in your marriage that you remember sex being the most satisfying?
I'm not sure I believe you.<eos> I think you and I are more alike than that.<eos> And we both know that martyrdom is for fools who dream of a glorious death that will ensure their memory lives forever.<eos> Personally, I'd prefer it were not my memory that lives forever, but me.<eos> And I think deep down, you are the same.<eos> If I am wrong and you do wish to martyr yourself, you will have that chance in the meeting house.<eos> Say the wrong thing, and you will die.<eos> Say the right thing, and you will live.<eos> Either way, the cattle shall still be eaten.<eos> Just serve him in the most minimal of ways, and he will allow you and my sister to live happily ever after.
Only to say goodbye to him.<eos> Why?<eos> Not all loves are created equal.<eos> I am no longer just a woman but a mother, and my love belongs to my child.<eos> He exists no more.<eos> My mother's heart denies it with every beat.<eos> My son is still there.<eos> I will not leave him a motherless child.<eos> Motherless child?<eos> You really have no idea what he is...
Well, deep brain stimulation has been proven to help alleviate intractable tremors like yours.<eos> So, when I wake up, maybe I can show you how I really play.<eos> The... plan is to actually keep you conscious while we operate, using M.R.I. images to target the general area of concern.<eos> - Blake?<eos> No, I figured we'd be using intraoperative micro-recordings to precisely locate the nucleus.<eos> Exactly, and how will we know when the procedure is working?<eos> Having our patient perform delicate motor skills while we introduce the electrodes.<eos> In Kyle's case, he will play the guitar.<eos> Wait. So, I'm<eos> I'm gonna play the guitar while you are poking around in my brain?
So that's a "not yet."<eos> I haven't done my thing, either.<eos> Caroline, with all your money from Hollywood, you could pay other people to do this stuff... and also replace the transmission on a 2012 Yaris.<eos> We have to save all our movie money for the dessert bar.<eos> Believe it or not, my boobs can't get us zoning permits.<eos> But they did get us kicked out of an architect's office.<eos> Oleg, did you talk to your connection at City Hall about expediting our liquor license?<eos> Yes, she told me, "Don't ever sneak into my home through the bathroom window again."<eos> Oh, this is rich.<eos> Now you two see some of the hell I go through as a small business owner.
You've never been in deep anything.<eos> Well, wait, is that why those scary-looking guys came into the diner looking for you and made some threats?<eos> I remember something about a strike and no balls.<eos> Something about no balls?<eos> You monsters didn't get the precise wording on a threat to my life?<eos> I was a little distracted, Han.<eos> J. Crew claimed to have a 50% off sale, but then I clicked on the link, and it was an "up to" 50% sale.<eos> Mostly on men's suiting.<eos> Oh, do send me the link so I can select the suit<eos> Because you two can't take a damn message!
Well, if we're not gonna do it, at least put on a shirt. I am human.<eos> You really think you're gonna have time for us?<eos> Starting a new business and owning the diner?<eos> Yes!<eos> I had four jobs in sixth grade, and I still had time to follow Smash Mouth around the country.<eos> Not the band, a meth head my mom really liked.<eos> Chestnut had a big reaction to the news, as well.<eos> Where's the poop shovel?<eos> Hey, boss ladies, congratulations!<eos> I heard that you own the diner now.
- I know.<eos> - She's worried. - Well, I'm here now.<eos> In trauma, we're concerned with one overriding question... how did this happen?<eos> - I didn't want you to see me yet.<eos> - I know.<eos> Tatiana, you look... so beautiful.<eos> What was the mechanism of injury?<eos> How do we see past the mess and confusion of the trauma to figure out what the damage actually is?<eos> Infinite possibilities put the patient on the table in front of you.<eos> Now you have to figure out...

But before we could kind of complete that renegotiation, the food industry very aggressively steps forward and says, "Stop arguing, we've got you covered.<eos> We'll do the cooking."<eos> And you see this most vividly in an advertising campaign that Kentucky Fried Chicken launches in the '70s.<eos> It really is this brilliant strategy on the part of the food industry to align their interests with the aspirations of women and the pressure on men to solve this great problem.<eos> So everybody sees this as the solution and gravitates toward more and more processed food and fast food.<eos> And that ushers in the situation we're in now, where you have an industry that is deliberately trying to undermine cooking as an everyday practice and does a lot to convince us it's really hard, really time-consuming, really messy,<eos> and you'd be so much better off letting us cook for you.<eos> [Michael] When you let a corporation cook your food... they cook differently than people do.<eos> You can tell just by reading the ingredient label.<eos> You don't have mono and diglycerides in your pantry.
I knew you'd come crawling back.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, you know me so well.<eos> I'm a little creepy crawler.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - Ha ha, that tickles.<eos> Hello, Conrad.<eos> I'm Sofia, the roommate.<eos> Can I take your jacket?<eos> And the clothes are coming off already.<eos> Okay, well, you two have fun.
You know who's gonna be really pissed?<eos> - Right?<eos> - Phil.<eos> You know Phil carries a loaded firearm?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Harvey? - I'ma dip out. Check on my storage units.<eos> Sure, go ahead.<eos> And did we find a replacement for Kelly Ann yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You two are in denial.
_<eos> _<eos> The opening act has arrived.<eos> Hello, Head and the Heart.<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Come on over here.<eos> Hey. Phil, we need to sound check.<eos> We're still clearing the stage.<eos> We'll be back soon for your sound check.<eos> So you gentlemen and lady can do your magic.
Um... Now, I'm the first to admit, right, I'm more than familiar with the world of sports and real estate.<eos> I come from order and structure.<eos> Bill, I know that you recently asked management for a retainer.<eos> What?<eos> And it isn't financially feasible at the moment.<eos> Right, yeah, I was gonna tell you.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Oh, really?<eos> I just didn't... yeah.<eos> Let's discuss this later.<eos> So are you two married?
Previously on Reign...<eos> You had your daughter, Claude, beaten, so that you could steal the regency back.<eos> And you are a murderer.<eos> We are no longer lovers, Christophe, just two people who keep each other's secrets.<eos> If Rome could give me a few more soldiers, I might actually be able to take my country back from rebels like the Protestant John Knox.<eos> We can help you buy an army.<eos> You and father executed 13 knights simply because you couldn't pay them.
If I want to cross the seas without English interference, that means I'd have to leave...<eos> Now would be wise.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> Finally, after all these years.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> We're conducting searches in every chamber to see if the poison is still here.<eos> If we can find the person responsible, maybe we can prevent a rebellion.<eos> Christophe. You're supposed to be on patrol.<eos> The queen regent asked for me.<eos> I thought you two were finished.
Why not?<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> I overheard you planning some kind of feast in the Great Hall the other night.<eos> But you didn't call for servants to clear it afterwards, which is odd.<eos> And you took a long time to return to your chambers.<eos> Do you always follow me?<eos> Tracking my every movement?<eos> It's a game I play sometimes to keep my mind entertained.<eos> I pretend you are my prey, but I don't kill you.
A killer with a contingency letter hanging over my head, in case anything should happen to you.<eos> You know my secrets.<eos> And I know yours.<eos> You had your own daughter beaten to reclaim the regency.<eos> And I've gone so long without a kill.<eos> I don't know why you rule out a future for us.<eos> I don't.<eos> Please go away.<eos> Tell me why that feast has you so anxious.<eos> And if you don't tell me yourself, I'll find out on my own.
Queen Mary.<eos> As you intend to race off to Scotland, I'm curious, what will you do about Lola?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She's still in England. And once your military campaign to reclaim your Scottish throne goes public, well, I don't imagine Elizabeth will react well.<eos> Are you really playing the concerned husband now?<eos> You are Elizabeth's rival.<eos> Once you're ruling on England's borders, then Lola's value as a hostage increases tenfold.<eos> Elizabeth will keep my wife captive forever.<eos> But I don't suppose that even crossed your mind, did it?<eos> Actually, it did. And while you've been chasing power here in France, I have already set into motion a plan to return Lola home, before I reach Scotland.

And while you've been chasing power here in France, I have already set into motion a plan to return Lola home, before I reach Scotland.<eos> And what exactly have you done, Lord Chancellor?<eos> Lola wants nothing to do with me. Oh, so that's it, then.<eos> You've just given up on the woman you vowed to spend the rest of your life with.<eos> I love my wife.<eos> No, you love power.
When you can get me out of here, I will flee.<eos> But while I'm here, I'm helping Mary.<eos> Do you realize that she might be on her way to Scotland as we speak, because of information I acquired?<eos> What kind of information?<eos> I overheard that the North Sea is unpatrolled as of now.<eos> That makes your situation even more urgent.<eos> If Mary's headed to Scotland, she will have an army with her, courtesy of the Vatican.<eos> Well, yes, I assumed as much.<eos> Elizabeth will feel threatened.<eos> And when Mary lands on Scottish soil with armed forces, you become a more valuable hostage.
Where is she?<eos> My mother deserves a proper burial.<eos> Does she?<eos> Her body's in the sea.<eos> Bash, think.<eos> I'm the regent of France!<eos> How will you explain my death at your hands?<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Is your mother, a woman who would sacrifice anyone for her own gain, worth dying for?<eos> Since you are the real king of France, consider this my resignation as your deputy.
Hijriyyah Al Bouri.<eos> We believe she was in your Islamic literature class four years ago.<eos> I don't remember her.<eos> But it was a very bad time.<eos> Many students disappeared.<eos> Laila, I want you to understand that nothing you say to me will have any impact on your brother or his family in Sirte.<eos> You have my word, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> This girl has been used like a chess piece... denied her freedom, denied an education, forced into a horrible situation against her will.<eos> And so now you want to use her to get something you want.
Everything will be linked to our servers.<eos> Any replies will come straight to us.<eos> Laila already sent me a draft.<eos> You got till tomorrow morning to see if you get any hits.<eos> Then we move on with Jose's plan.<eos> Excuse me, guys.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> This is embarrassing.<eos> It's a teachable moment, and I want you to be a part of it.
This is deep UC.<eos> I'm going out on a limb here<eos> - even acknowledging this...<eos> - And I appreciate that.<eos> But underage girls are still being raped and trafficked.<eos> Well, where SVU sees victims, we see willing participants.<eos> These girls are not exactly madonnas.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Never mind that.<eos> We care just as much about these traffickers as you do.
She would've been fast asleep by the time her lungs filled with water.<eos> A drug overdose?<eos> No.<eos> That couldn't have been an accident.<eos> I never should've brought you to Cara.<eos> - They killed her.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You keep saying, "They," Nina.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I told you from the beginning that all I wanted to do was save the girls, and you gave me your word you would protect them.
Midday yesterday.<eos> She was very upset. She wouldn't leave her room.<eos> Priest even agreed to take her confession up there.<eos> - Hang on. She saw a priest?<eos> - Well, yes.<eos> Every Wednesday, the priest comes to take confessions.<eos> Cara always saw him.<eos> Went to mass on Sundays too.<eos> Did you see her afterward?<eos> I left her alone until you arrived.
I'm gonna blow Diane away and get a spot on that team.<eos> 'Cause, baby, you know what?<eos> I got a few moves ain't nobody seen.<eos> Ooh, please, Hammer, don't hurt him.<eos> Wait...<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Oh, yes, it's happening.<eos> Oh! - Honey, oh!<eos> - It's Hammer Time. - Yes!<eos> When I say "Chicago," you say "Bulls."
- Previously on Wayward Pines...<eos> - They're gone.<eos> Tonight, the people of Wayward Pines are gonna eat real food.<eos> The town is starting to finally come back together.<eos> Look, you can tell me all the stories you want about what this place is, but what I won't accept is a reality that I wake up in a dictatorship.<eos> Wayward Pines needs a new generation.<eos> You all will have the honor of parenting the first generation of 100% originals.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2,000 years?<eos> How could we have known it would come to this?<eos> How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?<eos> He knew.<eos> My soul is replenished.<eos> I need you to have faith, CJ.<eos> You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.<eos> You are a part of that.<eos> And what will you tell them?<eos> Group A. You'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the corn bread.
I'll call right back.<eos> - ..into the forest...<eos> - That was Gemma Webster.<eos> Alice says she's ready to help us find the place she was kept.<eos> Right, then, let's go.<eos> Thank you for bringing me, Sergeant.<eos> You don't have to do this, you know?<eos> I mean, the psychologists are coming, you just need to get better.<eos> Or take me or your mum with you.<eos> You're going to need someone... I don't want you to... be there.
Like being able to see again.<eos> I can see just fine.<eos> I always have.<eos> Do you ever hear that fable about the turtle?<eos> He lived in a tiny pond at the foot of a mountain, swimming in circles and playing with frogs.<eos> The thing he loved most was when his friends, the birds, came to visit.<eos> They'd tell him about their adventures, up snowy mountain peaks, lush green valleys.<eos> He desperately wanted to go with them.<eos> But he couldn't - they said - he didn't have any wings.<eos> He replied... .. "You could be my wings."
Right.<eos> You're going to stay at mine for a bit while we get your house sorted and I'll try and find someone to help look after you. Hm...<eos> You're a lovely girl.<eos> I knew a girl like you.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> She was beautiful.<eos> Alabaster skin.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> SHOUTING, DISTANT EXPLOSIONS You two shouldn't be in here. No shit!
I just...<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> Are you sure you're ready?<eos> Mrs Webster, Mrs Webster,where is Alice now?<eos> Mrs Webster...<eos> Mrs Webster will makea short statement.<eos> There will be no questions.<eos> My daughter, Alice Webster,was abducted in 2003.<eos> And four days ago,she came back to us.<eos> I know there'll be a lot writtenabout this - what happened to my daughter is one of those things,one of those... horrible things that you read aboutin the newspaper and you say,
Get out.<eos> Reed and Stone came to me for help, looking for Adam, and I... ..I told them no.<eos> I thought he was out having fun like the rest of them.<eos> If I'd had any idea...<eos> The war was over, but it was far from safe.<eos> But Adrian was always a reckless bastard.<eos> He took Henry Reed and went out to find Adam Gettrick, against my orders, with no back up and only each other for protection. Relax.<eos> Why?<eos> First we jump the wire, then we nick a translator's car to do it.<eos> You medics worry too much. You don't worry enough.
So Brigadier Stone is in hospital now.<eos> What, and you think I had something to do with it?<eos> Well, did you?<eos> This is it, isn't it?<eos> This is who I am to you.<eos> I'm just the monster that locked his sister in the shed to you, aren't I?<eos> The one that goes around putting old men in hospital... Matthew...<eos> And what if what you said was right?<eos> What if he did have something to do with Alice being taken?<eos> And you're all sitting around doing nothing. What then?
There's some serious shit going on, all right?<eos> Exhibit B:<eos> One of Rick's sacred Potato Heads with a Dirty Sanchez, a mustache made of excrement.<eos> Is that actual shit?<eos> It's a chunky brown crayon.<eos> The point is, Phil was our leader, and without a true leader...<eos> What about Bill?<eos> ...we go to lawlessness, disorder, chaos!<eos> Exhibit A was our cases missing, all right?<eos> I mean, do you think The Head and The Heart would dare to fuck with us if Phil was still around?
Now, for the next three days, the next three shows, our very special guest that's gonna be opening is...<eos> Lindsey Buckingham.<eos> Wow. - Oh, yeah, really?<eos> - Right? Huh?<eos> How about...<eos> Fantastic. I'm a really huge fan of his. Yeah.<eos> Reg Whitehead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Um, okay, so just before you all... you don't have to... you can stop holding.
Wanda?<eos> I'm Perry's friend.<eos> Did Dennis do that to my song?<eos> Change it back now.<eos> Talk to Dennis.<eos> The evidence was planted.<eos> We got history, Hodiak.<eos> I'm calling it in.<eos> There's only one thing left to do.<eos> Now, you and Sadie know what I'm asking you for, don't you, Tex?
It's okay.<eos> Alice was so afraid, and... her reaction was understandable.<eos> You're being generous.<eos> When I got lost through my own stupidity... I was terrified that no one would ever find me. That I'd never see Alice again, see my baby born, grow up.<eos> I thought about you two and Paige.<eos> All the things that being a parent can mean.<eos> Anyway... sorry for what happened.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> That's what I came to say.<eos> Pastor Tim... W-Would you and Alice like to come to dinner sometime later this week or whenever is good for you?
When she first started coming here to church, I felt threatened.<eos> I was...<eos> I was afraid I was gonna lose her.<eos> To God?<eos> And to you.<eos> But it didn't happen.<eos> In fact, we've gotten closer, and things have been better.<eos> And there's nothing that I did or Philip.<eos> It was you.<eos> You took a risk.
I would very much like it if you'd stay.<eos> Times like these, I used to like a little drink.<eos> Remember that time at the tiki bar where you took that torch...<eos> I'm not that guy anymore.<eos> "Bassist Rick Bayless was clearly inebriated by the end of the evening."<eos> You go after Rick, you go after me.<eos> I'm sorry, Natalie. We had to get a restraining order on your visits.<eos> And here I was thinking foolishly that we had the makings of some sort of friendsh... friendship.<eos> You don't want to be my friend anyway.<eos> You two are in denial... about a lot of things.
I have everyone's room key packets.<eos> Here you go, Donna.<eos> - Thank you<eos> - Uh, Kelly Ann, Lonny.<eos> Hey, guys, have a great day off. Oh, and by the way,<eos> I'm doing my very first open mic night tonight at Chortles on River Street.<eos> So if you're in the mood for some stand-up comedy...<eos> Thank you, Harvey, Yeah, that sounds, uh...<eos> Anyway, we've managed to be rather clever with group bookings, haven't we? Ah, it was mostly you.<eos> Eh, well, you helped immensely.
So, uh, you know, don't worry.<eos> I'm mainly worried because you look so worried.<eos> I know.<eos> But there was that great moment when it went silent, after "All the Beauty," and... and someone shouted out, "I love you, Rick."<eos> - Remember?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That was me.<eos> He just looked so lost up there.<eos> And now he is.<eos> So you actually believe that because I said the name of that city that I've cursed your bus?
- What the fuck?<eos> - Oh, he's okay.<eos> - You guys shitting me?<eos> Uh, what are you doing here?<eos> Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Splash some water on your face.<eos> Natalie?<eos> Are you two next?
Because the bridegroom isn't?<eos> Really, Beatrice.<eos> - Mr Moffatt is --<eos> - Mr Moffatt is rich.<eos> He has no other quality that is visible to the naked eye.<eos> - His father was a tailor.<eos> - His father WAS a tailor, many years ago... .. before he demonstrated his brilliance of mind.<eos> And made a lot of money.<eos> Sssh. Here is Miss Thorne now.<eos> You all make a charming picture.
I'm sorry if you...<eos> Oh, please don't think of me.<eos> I never expected it for a minute.<eos> Miss Thorne is much too sensible to have imagined any such thing.<eos> It's a lovely time of year for a honeymoon.<eos> - Where will you go?<eos> - Mr Moffatt talks of Paris.<eos> Whoever heard of going to Paris in September?<eos> Whoever heard of letting the bridegroom have a say on the matter?<eos> Mr Moffatt must go where you choose to take him.
I'm quite used to it.<eos> I want no trouble tomorrow evening.<eos> You will not spoil Frank's party.<eos> Good day, Doctor Thorne.<eos> He's still in bed, Doctor.<eos> There's something not right about his legs.<eos> - And the drinking?<eos> - He's got that Winterbones with him, writing and writing and doing his business.<eos> Oh, please send him away.<eos> If I send Winterbones away, will you keep the drink away?
Indeed, you ain't.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> And Winterbones has no place here, scribbling away, stinking of gin.<eos> Mr Winterbones should go back to London.<eos> Lady Scatcherd can be clerk for the time being.<eos> Winterbones will do no such thing.<eos> So there's an end to that.<eos> Doctor, don't let him talk in that way.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - You can go downstairs.
Wearing my other hat for a moment... .. Mr Gresham asks for another loan on the Greshamsbury estate.<eos> Is there any part of that left that I do not already own?<eos> I believe so.<eos> Shall we agree to it?<eos> We?<eos> It's not your decision to make.<eos> It's mine.<eos> You must do without the stimulus of drink.<eos> Who says I drink?<eos> Now, what's this nonsense I hear about you electioneering?
We have been through a good deal together over the years, what with one thing and another.<eos> What things?<eos> Things that might have made us enemies and yet they have not.<eos> I thought it was vulgar to be mysterious, so you always tell me.<eos> May I have the honour of the next dance?<eos> Well, my uncle is very tired.<eos> Can the next one be my turn?<eos> I'm afraid Mr Oriel has just asked me.<eos> Do you ever wish we had money?<eos> Only so you wouldn't have to tire yourself out, - by going to places like Boxall Hill. - Ah.
- Do you care about bonnets?<eos> - Well, why shouldn't I?<eos> Back there, why wouldn't you dance with Frank?<eos> How could I accept him when Mr Oriel had asked first?<eos> Was that the only time he asked you, in the whole evening?<eos> Uncle, you have told me yourself I am not worthy of Mr Gresham.<eos> I've told you no such thing.<eos> - You confuse me with the Lady Arabella.<eos> - I see.<eos> And if you were Lady Arabella, would you be pleased for your only son and heir to marry - a nameless b
Lady Arabella, good afternoon.<eos> Won't you come in here a moment?<eos> I'm so glad you came here today, for there is something... special I want to say to you.<eos> Something, erm... rather particular.<eos> You know what respect and esteem and real affection we all have for you. And for Mary also.<eos> So I very much hope, dear Doctor, that you won't take amiss what I am going to say.<eos> I'll endeavour not to.<eos> Let us not beat about the bush.<eos> You know the squire's position when it comes to the property.<eos> Indeed, you probably know the sums rather better than I.
Guys, we should get out of here.<eos> - This is epic!<eos> - Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, Peach, loosen up!<eos> Have some fun.<eos> Fun?<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> If you geniuses are normal, this species is going to end up extinct.
Previously on Roadies...<eos> So are you two, uh, married?
Literally one more person to move this car!<eos> Looks like he's gonna lose a few body parts unknown.<eos> 'Cause of that TV show, "Parts Unknown."<eos> Anthony Bourdain, what an asshole.<eos> Actual cockroach, what do you got?<eos> I got Demi Lovato's housekeeper and she's eating a Caesar salad.<eos> See you next Tuesday, (bleep).<eos> Oh, she deserved it!<eos> No offense, but, if anyone else noticed, like, I'll say it, she's not white.<eos> You guys, you're my friends even if I don't pay you, right?
An honor I gratefully accept.<eos> My dear Winston.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Would it be terribly unconstitutional of me to say how happy I am?<eos> I've missed our weekly chats.<eos> Your predecessor is a fine parliamentarian. A good man.<eos> But, well, as company, as a companion...<eos> An empty taxi pulled up at the House of Commons, and Mr. Attlee got out.<eos> Quite.<eos> Now you may congratulate me in return.
I wanted to look at him.<eos> Why?<eos> To see the person who killed Grace.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you think I'm guilty, let the police decide.<eos> 'I'd never thought he'd be capable of something like this.'<eos> I'm praying that he didn't, but... it wasn't that long ago...<eos> That's in the past, Moira.<eos> He's gotten his head straight now.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you two are family.
on the speakers overhead, and then all of a sudden, the lights just go out on you.<eos> Sopranos style.<eos> But until then, me and you are good.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Well, I can...<eos> I can live with that. I suppose.<eos> It's a mood.<eos> It's a feeling.<eos> It's... it's, uh, chaos and... and darkness, the very death of rock and roll.<eos> Hmm? You, the last great hope, surviving in the wasteland.
Okay, church lady says the van is usually driven by their reverend, a Father Joseph Leahy.<eos> Another priest?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> _ Yes, that's our minivan.<eos> I loaned it to Nina this morning. She said she was in trouble.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Do you have any idea where she was headed?<eos> I gave her the keys to my family's lake house in Vermont.<eos> You did?<eos> All right, so you two must be... must be close.
So bullet was .22 caliber.<eos> And it bounced around inside like you'd expect.<eos> And then I'm still waiting for some more interesting stuff.<eos> Something more interesting than the cause of death?<eos> I think so.<eos> For starters, I sent blood samples to toxicology to see if he was taking any enhancements.<eos> Enhancements?<eos> You think he was juicing?<eos> Well, P.E.D.'s help in two major ways. They increase lean muscle mass and then they speed recovery from injuries.<eos> So here you have a guy who had 5% body fat, and his muscles have muscles on top of them.
Sure.<eos> Awesome. Thank you.<eos> You two.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Okay, well, I'm all about talkin'.<eos> Right this way.<eos> So...<eos> I wanna know who made the leak to the press calling my client "uncooperative."<eos> Ah, what leak?<eos> They all quoted an SFPD source, and you're the two cops who came sniffing around.
Thanks, friend.<eos> You think that has anything to do with the video with you threatening him on it?<eos> You mean outside the Ferry building?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> I got in his face for, like, 30 seconds.<eos> So that's your whole thing?<eos> You think that makes her an actual suspect?<eos> Well, Twitter does.<eos> And y'all aren't saying anything, which is cool, but it's like this.<eos> Either they're gonna come up with a story or you're gonna come up with a story.
I mean, this place is sweet.<eos> Listen, I know you guys got this little Frick and Frack thing going on with the players.<eos> You got the good-times approach to them.<eos> You got the wild parties.<eos> You know, you're one of the guys, you're charming, you're up front.<eos> One of you is good-looking.<eos> Please, you're embarrassing me.<eos> But here's the deal.<eos> I don't have a lot of love for guys who want to waltz into my backyard and hang a shingle.<eos> I've been doing this thing for 20 years and you've been doing, what, 20 minutes, and you think you're gonna steal one of my clients?
Someone far more sensible.<eos> And that concludes my evidence, your worship.<eos> only to add that I hope 'ee see fit to send these men to the gallows, for how else may we break our shores of this iniquitous trade?<eos> We thank you for your diligence, Mr Vercoe.<eos> You may stand down.<eos> A straightforward case, I think, in the context of the monstrous events still unfolding in France?<eos> I agree with you, sir.<eos> My concern... Which I share, is how to balance severity of judgment with the appearance of mercy.<eos> The appearance of mercy?<eos> For, as you say, our duty is to allay rebellion, not stoke it.
What price would you be willing to pay for that promissory note?<eos> Any.<eos> I thought so.<eos> What will you do with it?<eos> That will depend.<eos> I cannot believe you would call...<eos> After my reception from Francis last night?<eos> I don't expect you to be disloyal to Francis, but don't you personally think this feud has gone on long enough?<eos> You know Francis when his mind is set.<eos> He holds you to blame for the prosecution of Ross.
He is too loose-lipped to keep his trap shut!<eos> While passing your husband's mine, I came upon a man who was bruised and bleeding.<eos> His name was...<eos> Vigus?<eos> I know him.<eos> He works there on tribute.<eos> He tells me there's a deal of ill-feeling about on account of the rumours.<eos> Rumours?<eos> Of an informer?<eos> Ah, but you're so out of the way here, perhaps the tales do not reach you.
Will you do that?<eos> I'll try.<eos> George Warleggan has my promissory note?<eos> Alas, so... ..I'd not expect much sympathy for any request to extend the loan period.<eos> - Goodnight, sir.<eos> - Goodnight, sir.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Yes, and physic will not cure it.<eos> What will?<eos> Your presence here is what she craves, and you have a life elsewhere.
But when you see me not smiling, you mustn't think I'm sad or displeased with you, only that I'm trying to spare my face.<eos> It's important for a lady to look her best.<eos> Why?<eos> You'll understand when you're older.<eos> Seven months has seemed a lifetime.<eos> Did my letters not satisfy you?<eos> They evoked pleasure and pain in equal measure.<eos> Forgive me, I'm a little at sea.<eos> All I know for certain is I'm my own mistress, yet no freer to follow my heart.<eos> But I'm here, and you're here - perhaps that's all that matters.
But to Mark Daniel.<eos> I could put the word out, get a letter to him?<eos> I'd be very grateful.<eos> And in exchange...<eos> Yes? One drawback to your cove...<eos> You've always insisted, haven't you, that all must be done in a single night?<eos> Don't blame you, but 'tis deuced awkward.<eos> If we could store some of the goods - two, three days... Ten men do in three nights what 30 do in one.<eos> Less chance for the informer.<eos> Bring the cargo ashore and hide it, if you catch my drift.
You wish to devote the money to Wheal Grace.<eos> No. To a special purpose.<eos> Francis's widow and family are in dire need.<eos> More so than yours?<eos> Two years ago, Francis sank his last ã600 into Wheal Grace.<eos> I want Elizabeth Poldark to have it back.<eos> Will she accept?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Which is why I need your help.<eos> When my shares in Wheal Leisure are sold, you'll make an offer for Geoffrey Charles's holding in Wheal Grace on behalf of an anonymous client whom you represent.
As your banker and friend, I must advise against.<eos> You cannot afford it. And you have your own wife and child to care for.<eos> Would it not seem as if you value your cousin-in-law's comfort ahead of hers?<eos> It might, if I chose to tell her. Which I do not.<eos> I am here.<eos> Francis is not.<eos> Demelza has resources which Elizabeth does not.<eos> She's a miner's daughter. She has learned to survive.<eos> Elizabeth is a gentlewoman.<eos> And you are a madman.
It might, if I chose to tell her. Which I do not.<eos> I am here.<eos> Francis is not.<eos> Demelza has resources which Elizabeth does not.<eos> She's a miner's daughter. She has learned to survive.<eos> Elizabeth is a gentlewoman.<eos> And you are a madman.<eos> A madman who can now order his life with a clear conscience.<eos> My niece is in Truro.<eos> I have taken the opportunity to summon you. I imagine you've some idea why?
I have.<eos> See, Caroline, you must understand that though I might tolerate the young man on a professional basis, I cannot permit him to have sight of you again after his impudent pretensions to your hand.<eos> I misunderstood his attentions, Uncle.<eos> Now that I apprehend them, I will know how to behave in future.<eos> Caroline.<eos> You're an accomplished rider, Dr Enys.<eos> Clearly such talents would be wasted in city life.<eos> I have other talents which would not.<eos> But you can't bear the thought of Bath.<eos> And you can't bear the thought of marriage.
Can you give it?<eos> Nor am I at liberty to disclose their name.<eos> It was their express condition.<eos> - Is it someone we know?<eos> - Is it Trencrom?<eos> - Sir Hugh?<eos> The money is available the moment you sign the new promissory note.<eos> Is it Horace Treneglos?<eos> I cannot tell you anything more.<eos> But you, knowin' this person, do advise us to accept?
Learn my lesson.<eos> Plough my fields, harvest my crops, cherish my family.<eos> Live a quiet life.<eos> There's a lot to be said for it.<eos> My wife would agree with you.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> I turned it on the cobbles, sir, and it sudden go all tight.<eos> We thought to send Charlie for you, but since he be sick, Mistress Poldark did kindly go.<eos> What's the matter with Charlie?<eos> Well, sir, you did ought to know that.
'Tis good of 'ee to call, sir.<eos> Sit up. I want to examine you.<eos> Nay.<eos> Sit up, man.<eos> You say you have a fever.<eos> Let me see what ails you.<eos> Good evening to you, sir.<eos> 'Tis a fine night.<eos> Aye.<eos> Well, if you will not retire, then I must.
With the angels' wings coloured red by Hubert himself!<eos> There was a soldier.<eos> Save us!<eos> Where? By the long field.<eos> And Ross'll walk straight into the ambush!<eos> What will 'ee do?<eos> You'll know when I've done it.<eos> You go home, surgeon.<eos> Forget what you see'd.<eos> There's nothing you can do now.
So you can tell Trencrom, till he offers to stand in court in your place, he can sling his proposals and his guineas and his secret caches off Damsel Point!<eos> My money's on transportation.<eos> It's not essential.<eos> Elizabeth's already unnerved by his involvement. Any form of discredit in court today will suffice.<eos> I admire your confidence.<eos> When one has laid the foundations, one has every right to expect a result.<eos> Call Ross Poldark!<eos> Well, well... ..here we are again.<eos> There are those who seem capable of learning from their mistakes. And those who do not.<eos> Clearly, you fall into the latter category.
To relieve her poverty, I bought all his shares in Wheal Grace, through a third party, knowing she'd not accept the money as a gift.<eos> But why should you...?<eos> Because I felt under a burden of obligation... ..to Francis and his family...<eos> ..which is now discharged.<eos> Of course, at the time, we had Trencrom's money coming in, but... ..since the ambush...<eos> Are you angry?<eos> That you help Elizabeth.<eos> And Geoffrey Charles.<eos> And leave Jeremy and me to fend for ourselves.<eos> You have me to fend for you.
When?<eos> ! About October....!<eos> Is it Verity's news which keeps you awake?<eos> I think so.<eos> I can't imagine what else it could be.<eos> No.<eos> I don't suppose you can.<eos> And I got the impression that she thinks her circumstances were about to change.<eos> Is it not dangerous, Captain, riding when you're not recovered?<eos> You leave me no choice!
I'm a soldier, not a spy.<eos> I hold nothing against Captain Poldark, except he married so charming a wife.<eos> So I trust you hold nothing against me for what I did.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'm obliged to you for what you did not do.<eos> So now I'm forced to venture out for company and gossip.<eos> So what can you tell me?<eos> What news of your cousin-in-law, Mistress Elizabeth?<eos> I am sure I've heard nothing.<eos> I'd have thought you, of all people, would know.
Domestic cigarettes.<eos> I also detected faint traces of charcoal and coconut.<eos> Right.<eos> Killer must have come straight from a luau.<eos> While anything's possible, I think it would be premature to trawl about at local Polynesian venues.<eos> Better we focus on the penthouse in Tribeca where the robbery was staged.<eos> In the works. New owner's been notified.<eos> I'm meeting the captain there in 30.<eos> I'll go. You check on Ms. Wen.<eos> Actually, I think you both should.
That'd be, what? Like, a hundred years for us?<eos> No, 50, after he pays his taxes.<eos> Well, I guess he has a big nut to cover though, right?<eos> I mean, between the wife and the house and the kids and his boys, his toys, his personal payroll. Maybe he had to play.<eos> We'll need a forensics accountant.<eos> Doctor what?<eos> Adler.<eos> I'll call her.<eos> All right.<eos> Then you two of you go relieve Molk and Navarro.
It's okay.<eos> You don't need her.<eos> The kids in my class say I'm weird.<eos> Well, then weird can be your superpower.<eos> Besides, who needs normal?<eos> If you go to the land of normal, no one will be there.<eos> So is this normal?<eos> Just another day at the office.<eos> Okay, watch your head.<eos> All right, will you do me a favor and just keep her as long as you can, please?
How am I supposed to do homework?<eos> By actually doing your homework, not Googling the answers.<eos> Louise?<eos> Facebook is not homework, okay?<eos> God, you can't stop lying.<eos> - Neither can you!<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> I know about you and Terry.<eos> He's not just your partner, he's your boyfriend!<eos> You have sex!
Why didn't we do this at camp? It's so much more fun than making friendship bracelets.<eos> But not as much fun as dream catchers.<eos> Seriously, these past four days have been...<eos> Thrilling?<eos> Scary?<eos> I was gonna go with magical.<eos> Amy!<eos> How many of your friends are coming to our annual Ho-Ho-Ho-Holiday party tomorrow?<eos> I need an accurate count for the gingerbread men.<eos> Are you girls bringing dates?
Some things are better left unsaid.<eos> When 90% of the wealth is controlled by 10% of the population, and you add to that cronyism, corruption, political repression, pretty soon people will get desperate.<eos> And when people are desperate, they do desperate things.<eos> Like joining the Caliphate.<eos> Like my daughter did.<eos> I know the risks of hopelessness firsthand.<eos> Now, I made an old man's mistake.<eos> I gave up.<eos> And moved away.<eos> But you didn't.
Power changes people.<eos> You might grow to like being a president. Look...<eos> Mr. President, I need to talk to you right away.<eos> There's been an attack on the first lady's motorcade in Ma'an.<eos> She's safe and heading to the Palace now.<eos> But General Said is dead, and your daughter has been taken.<eos> I'm sorry, Sheik. I need to go.<eos> Europeans drew the map after World War One.<eos> The borders of these countries are entirely arbitrary.<eos> They don't have national identities the way you think of them in the West.
Well, marshals do a full background check on everyone having anything to do with those safe houses.<eos> Which means she was professionally backstopped.<eos> She's working for someone.<eos> And here I was, having such a pleasant morning. All right...<eos> Don't get hung up on Anna just yet.<eos> They may still be together, but I want you to focus on finding Pena.<eos> Preferably before the Cubans realize he's missing.<eos> Well, Anna and Pena aren't the only ones missing.<eos> I'll deal with Hetty.<eos> You find Pena.
Please.<eos> I need water. I am parched.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You want water?<eos> Talk.<eos> Is that the son of a bitch that hurt Anna?<eos> Who is he?<eos> A bad seed.<eos> Always has been.<eos> You two were KGB together?
Hancock Park.<eos> In the private home of Mark Webster.<eos> He was and still is the head of industrial engineering at NARL.<eos> So Webster still knows things Russia would find important?<eos> Nulishkin has already been caught. He doesn't want to have to also go home empty-handed.<eos> Eric, send us the address of that house.<eos> Yup.<eos> Guys, I can't access the home security system, and I can't get anyone on the phone.<eos> We're going in dark.<eos> You two take the back; we'll go in the front.
Okay, footage had a whole lot of stink on it.<eos> But with a little bit of Irish luck, I cleaned it right on up.<eos> Seems that Babish broke in to get his hands on that laptop.<eos> But the story on Zorn was already published. The damage was done.<eos> Why would Babish still want Zorn's laptop?<eos> Yeah, we're missing a big piece here.<eos> We find that laptop, we find our answers.<eos> I'll get a warrant to search Zorn's house.<eos> What if Babish got away with it?<eos> Well, you two go and search his family house in Lafitte.
This is the proof.<eos> So it is the same killer. Yeah.<eos> Which is a nice way of saying,<eos> "Boom, we told you so. What?<eos> Bro-astian for the win."<eos> That's "Brody" and "Sebastian" combined.<eos> You just...<eos> We're done here.<eos> Sounds like our killer has a very specific M.O. Well, if he's struck before, there may be a record of it.<eos> All right, you two start with the NCIC database.
I would sooner slit my throat and Jeff's throat before I'd let that happen.<eos> Dina, if... if you're gonna be here, I just need you to observe.<eos> Ah, Assistant Manager style.<eos> I got it.<eos> So I am authorized to rehire Glenn.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's... that's great.<eos> Fantastic news, Jeff.<eos> Thanks. Take that off.<eos> Corporate is just asking that you and the rest of the employees sign here.
You appear to be wearing a wedding gown this Halloween.<eos> I am dressed as Mrs. Chad Radwell, because my on-again, off-again sometimes-sexy role-playing lover was murdered last night!<eos> But you already knew that. MUNSCH:<eos> No one can know the truth, or they will shut this facility down. MUNSCH:<eos> The killer isn't just killing patients anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Why has the pattern been broken?<eos> Who can say?<eos> What I do know... is that Halloween night is upon us, and massacres tend to happen in this hospital on Halloween night.<eos> I hope you two are prepared, 'cause I have a feeling that this year... is gonna be a doozy.
All right, ladies!<eos> Are you ready to see the places From your favorite scenes from your favorite show,<eos> "sex and The city"!<eos> "sex and the city," that's right!<eos> I can't, i can't, i can't, i can't, i can't.<eos> who's with me?<eos> we went for a walk, but we are first.<eos> We were here, but we went for a walk.<eos> Are you excited for your "sex and the city" tour today?<eos> All right, when i say sex, you say and the city.
And then every tuesday, steve would pick her up.<eos> Super solid, classic steve behavior.<eos> Big would never do that.<eos> Big would never do that!<eos> Big!<eos> See, this is still really heavily about steve.<eos> Next stop, ladies, grab your panties Because we're gonna see where charlotte and her gay friend Go shopping for blouses!<eos> But before that, We're gonna see where samantha got in the ass!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I say cosmos, you say anal.
Mr. Grant would like you to speak to Carruthers' widow.<eos> Yeah, his operation is small, but it's very lucrative.<eos> Mr. Grant would like to make her an offer.<eos> First he kills the man, then he takes his company.<eos> Well, it's just good business.<eos> It's a relief, isn't it?<eos> That moment you set foot again on solid ground.<eos> You're Captain Chesterfield, I suppose?<eos> I am.<eos> And you are?
Nothing that would draw attention.<eos> Johnson's doin' an inventory.<eos> He's in the company storehouse right now counting pelts.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Orders from London he says.<eos> Lord Benton is out of favor.<eos> Oh, why else would the company send someone?<eos> They're lookin' for an excuse to sack Benton.<eos> This could be a disaster.<eos> You have to be the next governor here, not this Johnson!
I thought maybe if there were two of us.<eos> Is that what you thought?<eos> I know you don't like me, Mary, but I'm not goin' anywhere.<eos> We might as well work together.<eos> Okay.<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's better if I go alone.<eos> You played the whore and it didn't work, so... let's try the virgin.<eos> Captain Johnson?<eos> - You are?
By the order of Samuel Grant, you are to be imprisoned and brought to trial.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> ! Let go of me!<eos> Please. Do resist again.<eos> Mrs. Elizabeth Carruthers.<eos> You have my condolences, Madam, for your most poignant loss.<eos> Your husband was an exceptional man.<eos> My husband was a drunkard.<eos> I'm glad he's dead and so are you.
It's fuckin' insanity!<eos> Marry her?<eos> Give her the company?<eos> Fuck that!<eos> Good news.<eos> Your debt to Mr. Grant has been paid.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> However, Douglas Brown... You've been charged with the murder of Peter Carruthers.<eos> You're jokin'.<eos> You're the one who killed him!
I have one condition of my own.<eos> My brother's still in jail.<eos> For?<eos> The murder of your husband.<eos> And you want me to get him out.<eos> Ay.<eos> Pay a bribe, whatever it takes.<eos> I can't just snap my fingers, Mr. Brown.<eos> All I'm askin' is that you fuck... is... is that you try.<eos> You will not touch me.
I dunno.<eos> Prisoner I suppose.<eos> All right.<eos> Hoods up.<eos> Oi!<eos> Stop!<eos> You three stop!<eos> Take Clenna and go!<eos> Go! - What are you doing, Michael?<eos> ! - Where are you two going?
I know.<eos> Then do something.<eos> To confront him now will get me killed.<eos> So you'd be content with a garrison of dead soldiers,<eos> Is that it? Why do you give a shit about those men?<eos> Because it's an opportunity.<eos> Earn their loyalty.<eos> With their support as well as your own soldiers, You can arrest benton now.<eos> Now's the time.<eos> Lock lord benton up. And you are governor.
They asked for you.<eos> The one on the right said he received your letter.<eos> Samuel grant.<eos> And malcolm brown came in very drunk.<eos> Asking for captain chesterfield.<eos> What is it with men and fucking revenge?<eos> All right, you keep an eye on brown,<eos> I'll deal with grant.<eos> Welcome to fort james, gentlemen.<eos> You must be samuel grant.
Yes.<eos> You're a competitor.<eos> I'm sure you're aware. That it is customary for a man of your stature. To provide a letter of intention.<eos> I also believe that things may get misinterpreted. Through written correspondence, And if one wants to make new friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> Well, if this is a party. Then perhaps I should pour tea.<eos> Look to the future, sir.<eos> I prefer to learn from history.<eos> To the king.<eos> Mr. Grant, You and your colleague are accustomed. To more hospitable southern climes.
I must caution you that here in the north, Death can be brutal. And come without warning.<eos> I do hope you understand. The world you find yourselves in.<eos> I have faced far more formidable circumstances, lord benton, And not only have I survived,<eos> I found the experience... Fulfilling.<eos> But I appreciate your concern for our welfare.<eos> It's late.<eos> We are raw from travel.<eos> Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?<eos> I do have a proposition for you.<eos> You yankees always do.
Declare yourself.<eos> Declan harp.<eos> Mr. Harp? Finally.<eos> Forgive mr.<eos> Pond, He is zealously dedicated to my protection,<eos> Which I appreciate.<eos> Why are you in fort james?<eos> We're both are committed to the demise of the hbc, Are we not?<eos> I've come to judge how long before fort james falls, And, if possible, To give it a little nudge.<eos> This cause could be advanced considerably. If you and your people were to trade with me.
Get to your proposition, mr.<eos> Grant, it's cold.<eos> I would like you to take a message back to the hbc. On my behalf.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because it will make you richer.<eos> A bribe then?<eos> It's an incentive.<eos> Tell them it makes more sense for them. To trade their furs through montreal.<eos> There's a ready port that's open. Far longer than fort james.<eos> And you would be our partner there?
Previously on Reign...<eos> You have magic in you.
What does Mary ask of you?<eos> To kill Queen Elizabeth.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> Following after Charles on some misguided plot to take down the Red Knights, and lose the king of France.<eos> You were right about the Red Knights.<eos> We have to escape.<eos> Your lordships.<eos> John Knox.<eos> Don't pretend you care that my sister is dead.<eos> James, you and I and the other lords can rule Scotland together as a Protestant government.
In your own chambers...<eos> - Reverend Knox.<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> If your intention is to take Mass, I must remind you that it is forbidden by the Lords of the Congregation.<eos> But I am your queen.<eos> I have returned and I will practice my faith.<eos> But you can tell the nobles who alerted you to my activities this afternoon that I have no desire to impose my religion on anyone else or to impede the worship of theirs.<eos> We can live together in peace.<eos> Scots united.<eos> Or do you not stand with us?
Scots united.<eos> Or do you not stand with us?<eos> Do you stand with Elizabeth, who plans to absorb Scotland, to erase its very existence?<eos> It will never happen.<eos> How can you be so dismissive?<eos> Our intelligence has been vetted.<eos> Elizabeth is planning some sort of aggression.<eos> Women say such things in anger for effect.<eos> For attention.<eos> You, your faith, and the Vatican are the real threat to peace.
Long live the king!<eos> - Long live the king!<eos> - And Thierry is dead.<eos> I can't, I can't do it.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You don't want what?<eos> To be king.<eos> God save Mary, Queen of Scots.<eos> God save her.<eos> And you are?
Oh, no.<eos> You are at war with my country.<eos> I'm not!<eos> I explained that to you and I meant every word.<eos> This idea of yours, a bloodless offensive, it is a delusion you have talked yourself into when once you knew there can only be one queen.<eos> And I had to choose mine.<eos> I welcomed you into my court.<eos> I confided in you.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Oh, you don't trust anyone.

Hanged himself in the night.<eos> A mortal sin, perhaps his second.<eos> He could have been lying to you, Mary, about his role in the Protestant massacre.<eos> No.<eos> I think the poor man killed himself because he thought I would torture him until I got the answer I wanted.<eos> Being trained as I am by Catherine De Medici.<eos> Maybe he was right after all.<eos> As much as it sickens me to do this... whether he was a liar or a victim, his death will not be in vain.<eos> This is Father Simon Xavier Ashby.<eos> You may see a Catholic priest, but I see a man guilty of committing atrocities against his countrymen, sentenced to hang by his queen.
I could tell Mary what you've done.<eos> With what proof?<eos> Only your speculation, which, yes, she might believe, causing her to come after me.<eos> Is that what you want her doing?<eos> Attacking the religious leader of the country when she has sworn tolerance?<eos> Who's shaking the jar then?<eos> If you care about your sister, you won't give her reason to misstep.<eos> And if I care about my sister, what do I do about you?<eos> Play all sides as you have always done, but be sure to stay on mine, because Mary's rule will not last.<eos> Scotland could be the first true democracy since the Greeks, and you could be its first leader.

How deadly is Marburg, Doctor?<eos> Well, depending on other co-morbidities such as the person's general health and access to quality medical care, the Case Fatality Rate is between 24 and 90%.<eos> The key to boosting the odds of survival is early and intensive medical intervention.<eos> Bess, get into it with Cameroon.<eos> Find out how to secure the necessary medical aid without capitulating to Boko Haram.<eos> Will do, sir.<eos> We've got to stop this thing while there's still time.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, with any luck we'll be back on the seventh floor within a few days.<eos> Until then, if you're working logistics on Cameroon, you're in the TV room.<eos> Matt and Daisy, you're in the dining room.
He went to the election and hasn't been back since.<eos> Mary, now that I'm here, can I say how sorry I am for all this... difficulty?<eos> It can't be helped, sir.<eos> I hate to think that we've banished you.<eos> Beatrice is hardly speaking to us.<eos> I must love her for that.<eos> Is it true she is engaged to Mr Oriel?<eos> It is.<eos> It seems quick to me, but they're very determined.<eos> - You know Beatrice.
Why don't you and I join forces?<eos> We could make a noise, and no mistake.<eos> Oh, you've cheered me up, Mr Moffatt.<eos> I have refused Lord Porlock, but one proposal seemed a poor return for a whole week in the country.<eos> Now at least I can claim two.<eos> - Two refusals?<eos> - I'm afraid so.<eos> But be honest, Mr Moffatt.<eos> You want their breeding as much as they want your money.<eos> - And you don't?
If only that could be.<eos> Goodnight, Lady De Courcy. And thank you.<eos> What did she mean?<eos> Only that Greshamsbury will not be saved by the gold from the oil of Lebanon.<eos> Thorne.<eos> Can I help you, Scatcherd?<eos> You know what I told you about the will?<eos> I do, and it troubles me that you have not altered it, if you've done something you don't want to do.<eos> I have altered it.<eos> I've added a letter, what you call a codicil... .. saying you, and only you, know the name of Anne's eldest child.
I thank you, Thorne.<eos> You brought an angel into this house... .. to make it easier for me to face what lies beyond the grave.<eos> Go to sleep now, Scatcherd.<eos> What a Sleeping Beauty scene is this?<eos> How's the guvnor?<eos> Come, Lady Scatcherd.<eos> You were with him to the last.<eos> That is the best a wife can hope for.<eos> Mary, take Lady Scatcherd to her room.<eos> So, Louis, although you are now the baronet, your father spoke of you to me and... has left you... under my charge.
And so she is my brother's daughter.<eos> But not quite according to the laws that normally govern these things.<eos> Go on.<eos> Forgive me, it is hard to go on.<eos> For when I do, I think I must destroy the happiness of one I love more than my life.<eos> Well, surely, the truth can't be so very bad, sir.<eos> It is bad enough, by heaven.<eos> A Mr Mortimer Gazebee.<eos> Dawson, would you please send word to Mr Gresham?<eos> You must be Miss Gresham and Miss Beatrice.
Poor Papa will be grateful for any help that he can get.<eos> Lady Scatcherd.<eos> You've caught me unprepared, Doctor.<eos> - Let me see what I can offer you.<eos> - Stay where you are.<eos> I had a message from your son. How is he?<eos> If he's still drinking too much,<eos> - you must exert your influence.<eos> - Oh, Doctor.<eos> You have more say with him than I.

How is he?<eos> If he's still drinking too much,<eos> - you must exert your influence.<eos> - Oh, Doctor.<eos> You have more say with him than I.<eos> And Miss Thorne more than either of us.<eos> You cut a fine figure, Miss Thorne.
You're a sight for sore eyes, you are!<eos> And Lord knows my eyes have been sore since I last saw you!<eos> - Ohh! Ohh! - But, Lady Scatcherd, what will they say?<eos> You forget I am a man now.<eos> Not to me, Master Frank!<eos> You may think what you like, you'll always be my little Master Frank!<eos> Lady Scatcherd, you forget yourself.<eos> Let Mr Gresham breathe.<eos> You know I nursed Master Frank when he was a boy, Louis.<eos> I seem to recall something of the sort, but you are Lady Scatcherd now. All that is behind you.
I remember you were very foolish.<eos> Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do. Or at least I know what you think I am ignorant of.<eos> Your uncle told me all about your birth.<eos> That is why you must not think ill of your mother for opposing me.<eos> Any mother would have done the same.<eos> Mary, if you'll tell me that I'm nothing to you, then I'll go away and I'll leave you in peace and my mother may be easy.
I never could be.<eos> But your exams are less than a month away.<eos> You should be working harder than ever.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm only here for the dinner tonight.<eos> My father wants me to greet Sir Louis Scatcherd.<eos> I'm glad the doctor will be present.<eos> I hope he will be.<eos> It's not quite decided.<eos> Beatrice asked for you to join us.
But it may be safer to focus on Sir Louis for now, and you and Mama another night.<eos> I heartily agree.<eos> Here you are, Mrs Thompson. Ooh!<eos> Don't worry about the plates.<eos> I'll be back to get them.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I have a note for your uncle.<eos> And with one inside of it for Sir Louis from Mama.<eos> That's very sensible.<eos> Here you are, Mr Barnes.
I know it, and I am honoured, Sir Louis, but... you see, things are...<eos> Right.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> The fly's at the door.<eos> I'm pleased you're going, Uncle.<eos> I know you'll both enjoy it.<eos> I'm sure I will.<eos> It's time I saw the place, if I'm to live there.<eos> Oh, Sir Louis, I pray you won't be hasty.<eos> Of course, you would say that, when you so favour Mr Frank Gresham.

I should have paid a call on you sooner, but I have been in London.<eos> Was your ladyship in London this season? No.<eos> Not this year.<eos> Circumstances have kept us at home.<eos> I am very sorry.<eos> To be short of funds must be so distressing for a person like your ladyship.<eos> Let's hope things are mending for both our sakes.<eos> Do you hunt, Sir Louis?<eos> Depends what I'm hunting for.<eos> I gather you and your sister are both unmarried, Miss Gresham?

I never guess.<eos> I'll tell you, because I like to be precise.<eos> It cost ã22,419, four shillings and eight pence.<eos> It's a tidy sum.<eos> Eh, my lady?<eos> Isn't it a tidy sum?<eos> Lady Arabella?<eos> It certainly is.<eos> A tidy sum.<eos> You know, you parsons have the luck.
He cannot join the ladies, not in this state.<eos> The rest of you go.<eos> I will wait for the fly and take Sir Louis home.<eos> Always happy to see the ladies.<eos> Please apologise to Lady Arabella.<eos> What for?<eos> What's the matter with her?<eos> I think I'll go through.<eos> No, sir!<eos> You will stay here.
How does she know?<eos> after that frightful dinner. Mary Thorne told her.<eos> There's another name I had rather not hear spoken.<eos> Honestly, Mama, what with the Thornes and all the Scatcherds, we shall have to talk in a dumb show if you keep this up.<eos> Have you ordered the carriage?<eos> I am glad to see you, aunt, but I don't see quite what you can do.<eos> I may be useful.<eos> You never know.<eos> What about you, Alexandrina?<eos> Are you going to be useful, too?
He has gone to Boxall Hill.<eos> It is just as well, since it is to you we wish to speak.<eos> You know how fond we are of you.<eos> Mary, can we not put an end to this ill-feeling?<eos> It all depends on one thing, you know, and one thing only.<eos> Miss Thorne, do you consider yourself engaged to my nephew?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.<eos> Let me ask you this:<eos> do you seriously imagine you and he can ever be husband and wife?
It all depends on one thing, you know, and one thing only.<eos> Miss Thorne, do you consider yourself engaged to my nephew?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.<eos> Let me ask you this:<eos> do you seriously imagine you and he can ever be husband and wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you are set on holding poor Frank to a word casually given but now as binding as hoops of steel?<eos> And this family must lose its home and position, and Frank is to forfeit the future he has been brought up to enjoy.<eos> And I suppose you dare call that...
Yes.<eos> I do.<eos> Let me ask you this:<eos> do you seriously imagine you and he can ever be husband and wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you are set on holding poor Frank to a word casually given but now as binding as hoops of steel?<eos> And this family must lose its home and position, and Frank is to forfeit the future he has been brought up to enjoy.<eos> And I suppose you dare call that...<eos> We both know Frank thinks he is honour bound to throw away his future.<eos> Only you can give him back what his life might have been, by withdrawing from the field.
Is the woman who prevents a man from ruining himself the one who truly loves him?<eos> Or the woman who holds onto him through thick and thin, cost what it may?<eos> How dare you come here without an invitation!<eos> I invited them, Louis.<eos> At least, I am always pleased to see them both.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I wanted to come.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I cannot bear to be the cause of my family's ruin.<eos> You are not the cause.
I'm sure it would.<eos> Although I would not have thought the wife of a politician, condemned to watch him scramble up the greasy pole, much to be envied.<eos> So you do not approve?<eos> Augusta, think.<eos> Do you honestly believe Papa would receive an estate agent as a nephew?<eos> Lord De Courcy has always been very kind to me.<eos> And he is fond of you.<eos> But there are limits for a man used to the etiquette of the Court.<eos> You mean because Mr Gazebee works for his living?<eos> You say he's an honourable man, and so he is.
But I wish to make...<eos> Hush, my dear.<eos> Frank is quite right.<eos> Mary, we have behaved very badly towards you in the past, and there is no need for you to pretend otherwise.<eos> That is all over now.<eos> I will not criticise a mother for loving her son.<eos> But I hope you will not criticise me for loving him, too.<eos> Of course, now that we are no longer engaged...<eos> What?<eos> We broke it off after you begged me to do so.
She is to marry Mr Gazebee in December.<eos> I hope you don't regret your chance to enter on the arm of the groom.<eos> Certainly not, Doctor Thorne.<eos> I am happy where I am.<eos> When will you return to America?<eos> You think I should be done with my husband hunting, then?<eos> Is it hunting or drag hunting?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> With you as the lure, I sense plenty of excitement in the chase, but no chance of a kill at the end of it.<eos> While you prefer to catch your quarry, Doctor Thorne?
Um, no offense, but I'm really more of a lone ranger.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I can get this done in a more efficient manner without you looking over my shoulder.<eos> Well, that's what I told my mother when I looked at my first "Playboy."<eos> But it didn't happen then, and it's not gonna happen now.<eos> Well, that doesn't matter because... we have a problem.<eos> So you're saying, in this office, at any given moment, there's $100,000 hidden away.<eos> - That's what I'm saying. - Where?<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> Whatever the hell you two are in the middle of, it's gonna have to wait, because secretaries may talk to secretaries, but liars talk to idiots.
What, you wouldn't?<eos> Please, you'd throw a giraffe off of Noah's Ark just to save your sorry ass.<eos> The world's probably without unicorns because of one of your ancestors, and I--<eos> Will you just let me finish a thought, for God's sake?<eos> Louis?<eos> What exactly are you doing?<eos> Well, what does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I'm having a discussion about the fate of the firm with my dead secretary's ashes.<eos> Well, as long as it's not something weird.<eos> What exactly have you two been doing the last half hour?
So how's it coming?<eos> - How's what coming?<eos> - Your escape plan.<eos> There is no escape plan.<eos> We were told to keep our noses clean. That's what we're doing.<eos> You mean Arax?<eos> You're telling me you're scared?<eos> We're not looking for trouble.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Three things I know for sure: you don't scare; you thrive on trouble; and if you want off this rock, you're going to need my help.
Whatever.<eos> Hello, my friend.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> I'll say. I was expecting Two.<eos> But, you'll do, I suppose.<eos> Nice to see you too.<eos> So what brings you by?<eos> Gonna pull a few strings? Get us sprung for old time's sake?<eos> Unfortunately, the list of charges that you're facing makes that impossible.
Well, that's convenient because, for a while there, you were the one who we needed protection from.<eos> How'd you sneak these grapes past security?<eos> I mean, seriously.<eos> No, forget it.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I had a change of heart.<eos> I'm giving you the go-ahead.<eos> You want us to escape?<eos> I want us to escape.<eos> You come up with a plan, I'm coming with.
Perhaps you sent it to my Hotmail... Perhaps you didn't, but either way, I'll not be attending.<eos> I hope you have a beautiful day.<eos> Christoph, we're not leaving you, OK?<eos> - Not again.<eos> - I've seen the world, boys.<eos> I've done it all, I'm through.<eos> You've all got your jobs and your mortgages and your cars to worry about.<eos> I'm an expendable.<eos> I'm a pawn.<eos> And you're fucking kings.
Money? ! Milk!<eos> Are we going to keep this nice and affable, yeah, Christophe?<eos> Milk! Milk!<eos> Milk!<eos> - Milk?<eos> Right then...<eos> Everyone down on the ground, this is a raid!<eos> Customs and Excise!<eos> You're under arrest on suspicion of trafficking a controlled substance.<eos> I can't believe you fuckers set us up!
Why didn't you just go with him?<eos> Up until yesterday, I thought I was gonna be the daughter of a governor.<eos> And now I'm the daughter of a drug dealer, again.<eos> You ruined my life, so don't tell me you did this for me.<eos> The fact is, you hate him more than you love me.<eos> And that breaks my heart, Mami.<eos> Wait.<eos> It ends here.<eos> I'll honor your deal as long as you continue to honor mine.<eos> But if anyone should ever come to this farm and ask what you have asked or claim to have seen what you have seen or wants to talk about a book, won't be just you in that sewer,
The victims are people you were linked to at one time.<eos> Do you have any comment?<eos> In my past, yes, it's true,<eos> I've had dealings with these people.<eos> As a businessman in the private sector, I've had to stand up to these people.<eos> I have to fight with politicians whose cartel interests were more... more important than the interests of the Mexican people.<eos> Have I failed at times?<eos> Yes.<eos> But after yesterday's violence, I see only one more reason why I not only can but I must be the great leader the people of Sinaloa need and deserve.<eos> Vargas is for the people, and under Vargas, you and your children will be safe.
- I do. I like to help people and I think it's important to talk things through.<eos> Speaking of, are you a "good job" person?<eos> A-am I a what?<eos> Do you tell your daughter "good job"?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> We should talk about that.<eos> Maybe not right now, though.<eos> Right, darling?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't say "good job"?
I'll be back in just a minute.<eos> Keep matching up those jewels And see how far you can get, honey.<eos> there.<eos> Listen, for all intents and purposes, Our daughter left us a long time ago.<eos> We're raising this child.<eos> There's no other parental figure in his life?<eos> There was -- a terrific guy we thought was the dad, But it turned out heather lied about that.<eos> And we were worried that someone else, Someone who was married and had other kids And did have legal rights could come by<eos> And we're not about to give him up to a stranger.<eos> I don't think that's going to happen necessarily, But i have to say, i am surprised That you became so...
Is that when you started backing him?<eos> You also staked my ex-husband several times.<eos> That's how i know about your side business.<eos> Raydor. Yeah, i thought you might be related to jack.<eos> It's a bit of an odd name, raydor.<eos> Jack, he could've been one of the best.<eos> He was close several times.<eos> Couldn't commit.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> What if a player loses money when you stake him?
I don't feel like being manipulated today.<eos> I have said it a million times.<eos> As soon as this baby is born, She needs to put it up for adoption.<eos> Well, your mother might not take your advice, So you need to consider What sort of brother you're prepared to be.<eos> Well, the kind who puts the -- The safety and wellbeing and -- And long-term security of my sibling or whatever first.<eos> Just be aware -- Babies change our relationships... In unexpected ways.<eos> Such as?<eos> With gary in jail, if anything happens to your mother, You'd be your new sibling's next-of-kin.<eos> Ignoring the other sharon In your life's not gonna change that.<eos> maybe you're not up to the job, Because after 11, now 12, attacks By the same person committed at gunpoint,
- Thank God. - Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Great job, Captain. Great job.<eos> Oh.<eos> And, uh, really good work keeping your personal and professional lives separate.<eos> It... It can't always be done.<eos> Oh, oh, actually, Chief, um, that may be about to be tested further.<eos> I put my house up for sale, and we are planning on finding a place together.<eos> Wow. [Chuckles]<eos> So, you two are moving in together? - [Elevator bell dings]
Mr. Bowie, where you this morning...<eos> I'm not finding campus doll 101.<eos> Between 6: 00A.M. And 7:00A.M.?<eos> I was at the farmers' Market.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Robert cushing was murdered around that time.<eos> I thought when you called me in here, it was gonna be another terrible day, But that is fantastic!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Dead? !<eos> Oh, and you think I did it?
We're starting out with a misdemeanor morals charge. Wait.<eos> Wait. Wait. Wait.<eos> A morals charge? What the hell does that mean?<eos> You have to let me see my little girl right now.<eos> No, we don't, and you'd be better off<eos> Letting Mr. Corbett speak with her first.<eos> Your daughter should understand, that everyone has the right to a lawyer.<eos> And if a person doesn't like the one they have, One can be appointed for them by the state.<eos> Also, all suspects have the right to remain silent, And anything they say can be used against them In a court of law.<eos> You haven't already told her this?
You thought you were protecting your little girl.<eos> We're going to give you one last chance to do that.<eos> If you will write down exactly what you did to cushing, We won't charge Brie or her boyfriend with prostitution.<eos> She will not be branded For the rest of her life as a sex offender.<eos> Your little girl will get a second chance.<eos> Or you can ask Brie's lawyer to defend you For murder in the first degree, and then consider what this story will sound like On the day that your daughter takes the stand.<eos> I'll have Eric meet you downstairs, But you'll have to find your own ride home Because he's already signed away the car, Ma'am.<eos> I'll drive them.<eos> Guess you're all feeling proud of yourselves.<eos> Send me off to deal with Brie While you tricked her father into signing his life away.
You believe no woman is worthy to wear a crown.<eos> Don't let grief blind you, James.<eos> You were only the regent in Mary's absence. Now that she's dead, the nobles will be forced to recognize the man with the stronger claim to the throne, Lord Darnley.<eos> I know you despise him.<eos> He is a Catholic, after all, but he's a noble with a legitimate blood claim.<eos> You were born a bastard. You can never be king.<eos> But we don't have to hand over Scotland to a Papist like Darnley, nor anyone else with... "royal blood."<eos> You want to dissolve the monarchy.<eos> I want a nation that no longer answers to royal families.<eos> You and I and the other lords can rule Scotland together... as a Protestant government.
Take our beautiful guest.<eos> Help her bathe and change.<eos> Come with us, dear.<eos> Take his sword.<eos> - I thought we were guests.<eos> - You are.<eos> But Duncan told me about this ransom plot, and I'm not quite sure I trust a man who would scheme against his own sister.<eos> Assuming you're telling the truth at all.<eos> I've sent a rider to Falkirk to find Pauline's fiancé and report back at dawn.<eos> If you're lying to me, you and your sister won't leave this camp alive.
I still rule Scotland, not you.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Do nothing, but I promise you, others aren't making that mistake.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> My spies in England believe that Elizabeth is plotting to take the Scottish Crown.<eos> Has Elizabeth heard about Mary?<eos> If she hasn't already, she will soon enough.<eos> And if Elizabeth invades, all bets are off.<eos> She'll get rid of us both.<eos> I've preached against the reign of queens, and you've spent far too long defending Mary's throne.
Technically, yes, you can have a lawyer present.<eos> But you're not a suspect.<eos> You should be helping us.<eos> Why? You haven't helped me any.
Mr. Calderon... Please shut up.<eos> I had nothing to do with the death of this witness. I didn't know her.<eos> I was locked up in jail when she died.<eos> I only found out when D.D.A. Rosen informed me of it yesterday...<eos> Not my problem.<eos> We're going to find your prints at Colson's house, where the witness lived, and your DNA.<eos> So what?<eos> If we can prove that the eight murders you committed were connected to a larger conspiracy, there could be other defendants in this case, and your ability to act as your own counsel could go away.<eos> Ask Mr. Calderon.<eos> He may have been stupid enough to let you capture him, but Henry Colson will never testify against me, and you'll need better luck taking down his father and brother...
There are three signatures from you on this bag that contains Dwight's weapon.<eos> One for deputy Simms, DDA Rosen.<eos> No, no, no, that's not my signature.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my God, that's not even how I spell my name.<eos> We use two m's for "adamms," and the person who signed this used one.<eos> This is... This is forged.<eos> Someone forged my name on the evidence.<eos> If that's true, the bags could have been switched.<eos> Oh, my God, you're gonna think that I... oh, my God.
- Worse?<eos> Deputy Simms had three burner phones, and he used one of them to call Ava Jarvis several times before she ran away from the witness protection program with my foster kid, Mark.<eos> And also, let's not forget that deputy sheriff Simms was in all the sessions that Dwight had with Dr. Joe.<eos> So, why don't we just arrest this guy, and then we... Oh, wait.<eos> He was shot to death in the courtroom yesterday.<eos> I mean, does anyone seriously believe this guy planned his own murder with $4 million in the bank?<eos> - I mean, come on, people.<eos> - What does your captain say?<eos> She's at behavioral science doing her mandatory interview for shooting Darnell, but I know she would like a reason to search every single one of those apartments in Nazi land.<eos> I may have that covered, but, uh, you'll want SWAT along, in case they start using all these weapons we're looking for.
And... and I want... I want to buy a car without one of those breathalyzers attached to the ignition.<eos> I thought he'd ask for, the moon, the stars, and 77 virgins.<eos> A federal facility under another name. He knows something.<eos> He gets out, he commits vehicular manslaughter inside of a year.<eos> We can bring in your attorney...<eos> He's not getting out.<eos> And negotiate something in exchange... No, no, no.<eos> - I'm not negotiating.<eos> - It's all or nothing.<eos> I know things... Things you want to hear.
So, Chanels #9 through #11, meet Chanels #1 through #8.<eos> Listen up, bovines.<eos> Polite society says we can't haze you.<eos> But we can insist that you clean Chanel #5's bedpans before we return home. And she takes monster dumps.<eos> I want that thing sanitized.<eos> I want it so clean that we could eat novelty sundaes out of it!<eos> Now!<eos> Now...<eos> I am going to find out what happened to Hester if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And if it turns out that you three harbored a known serial killer, I am going to report you as accessories to murder.
Why do you need to be forgiven?<eos> Because I'm soiled.<eos> And because there is something wrong with me.<eos> I mourn for him.<eos> And that makes my heart a traitor.<eos> We have so much shame, you know.<eos> A woman can not help give her body when it is taken, but she should never give her heart.<eos> My daughter fell in love.<eos> I have to find a way to forgive her for a great crime.<eos> You have to forgive yours for a little one.
Let me talk to Ihab!<eos> Let me give myself up to him.<eos> - Let me give myself up to him!<eos> - Molly, Molly, Molly.<eos> Barry, let me talk to him.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Baby.<eos> - ­lt's Ihab.<eos> Ihab.<eos> You Americans are so arrogant, playing God, but there is no God but God.

I hate these people. I like you boys.<eos> I really do.<eos> But a loan this size, well, it's hard to warrant.<eos> Mr. Carlisle, our goal is to be the number one motorcycle company in America.<eos> Now, for us to realize that end, we'll need a long-term relationship with a long-term commitment.<eos> Indian's gonna build 45,000 motorcycles this year.<eos> How many is Harley-Davidson?<eos> 10... 10,000.<eos> But if we...<eos> Motorcycle industry is booming. And you limit your potential with sentiment.
Sir, you can't be in here.<eos> Hazel, it's fine.<eos> It's fine. You organized this?<eos> Got the others to join you?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It is unfortunately, what with your record sales and all.<eos> You couldn't stomach that we overtook you.<eos> So you cooked this up.<eos> Cooked up what?<eos> You're the ones who failed to protect themselves.
- Colonel Miller.<eos> So nice to finally put a face with the voice.<eos> Likewise.<eos> This is Captain Vaughn.<eos> She's here to help make sure you have everything you...<eos> Colonel, what the hell?<eos> Dr. Bailey, this is Major Thorpe.<eos> He's Cars...<eos> I'm Sergeant Carson's surgeon.<eos> And you are... the "Dream Team"?
This is Captain Vaughn.<eos> She's here to help make sure you have everything you...<eos> Colonel, what the hell?<eos> Dr. Bailey, this is Major Thorpe.<eos> He's Cars...<eos> I'm Sergeant Carson's surgeon.<eos> And you are... the "Dream Team"?<eos> You can't just make decisions for my patient.<eos> Uh, we're not here to step on toes, Doctor.<eos> You're here to make my patient a guinea pig.
Well, you better do something.<eos> She's right.<eos> Look, if we stop now, we're leaving him worse off than when we got him.<eos> He's not gonna survive the night.<eos> Ok... Stop.<eos> Stop it. Okay?<eos> You guys aren't telling me anything I don't already know.<eos> Just, I-I need a minute.<eos> I need some space to think.<eos> Okay? You all just go back in there and... irrigate.
She's coming back, right?<eos> She's coming back.<eos> Good.<eos> Because he's been under for a long time.<eos> Listen, I know you've had your reservations, but when we're done...<eos> I still have my reservations.<eos> I've known Carson ever since the Medical Corps.<eos> He's a one-night stand for you.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Look, you fly in, do a flashy surgery that'll make all the journals, and you're gone in the morning.
I would... review the biomechanics, and then I would... recalculate the angles.<eos> Okay.<eos> And then...?<eos> Okay, ladies!<eos> Okay, ladies!<eos> Hi!<eos> Here's how this is gonna go.<eos> Your teammate is down.<eos> She needs you. She needs your support.<eos> You're her spotters... all of you.
How do you not see those doors?<eos> And as for the baby?<eos> He was acidotic, not oxygenating.<eos> - We had to put him on ECMO.<eos> - Which was unsuccessful.<eos> That kind of perfusion can be too much for smaller babies.<eos> Riggs suggested ECMO.<eos> We all agreed. Wait.<eos> So, Riggs suggested it? Yeah.<eos> And you agreed with that?
It's a lot to figure out, I know, but you were right...<eos> it can be figured out.<eos> It's a six-hour flight, and you'll be able to see Sofia whenever you want.<eos> And we'll figure it out, right? Oh, crap.<eos> Um, so, we will talk about it, okay?<eos> But just thank you.<eos> Every surgeon who worked on Mrs. McKay and the baby said the same thing, including Dr. Warren.<eos> That they were backed into a corner and they didn't have a choice.<eos> The only difference with Warren is whether or not you think he's lying, whether you believe he didn't see that door open.<eos> And do you think he was lying? - No.
I heard there was blood on the walls... and the ceiling.<eos> Well, you know how amputations bleed.<eos> You hit the femoral at just the right angle, and it's<eos> - Amputations? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I heard he cut into some lady in a hallway.<eos> No, I heard he cut the leg off of some lady in an elevator.<eos> Below-knee.<eos> Very clean cut.<eos> That doesn't even make sense.<eos> What the hell are you two doing?
Why are you still here?<eos> You heard her.<eos> Scram.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh. It's... It's nothing.<eos> I was holding on to it for Gretchen.<eos> Her kid lost a tooth.<eos> I need to know everything.<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> I need to know what you two were doing.
I control the remote, trumped only by Dad.<eos> It goes Dad, me, you two...<eos> Then Mom.<eos> Three...<eos> I'm not sitting in the lawn chair at meals anymore.<eos> Whatever. It doesn't matter. We...<eos> I believe I was talking.<eos> And four... "The Dukes of Hazzard" beach towel is no longer my bath towel.<eos> Mom bought me a real bath towel.<eos> You two may now choose between the Dukes and the scratchy one that used to line the bunny's cage.
Give it.<eos> Actually, I believe the person who's going to pick what to watch is me.<eos> And we are going to watch "How the States Got Their Shapes."<eos> I want to find out why Tennessee is a parallelogram.<eos> - No way. - Ugh!<eos> Oh, I think we are.<eos> I have a verbal agreement.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I recorded you and Sue on the way home from the dentist.<eos> You agreed to all my terms.
That is such a glorified view of gentrification.<eos> Well, what is it, then?<eos> And can you use a movie example?<eos> Well, I don't have a movie example, but I can just tell you what it means, - if that works.<eos> - Well, I suppose, but just know I'm gonna be thinking of a movie example the whole time.<eos> Look, gentrification is when developers see an opportunity to make money off of a low-income community.<eos> You know, they buy up a bunch of property for cheap, and then they build high-end apartment complexes and restaurants and stores, and that attracts wealthy new residents, and then that drives property values up until people are forced out.<eos> Now, I know you're trying to say something negative, but everything you saying so far sounds good to me.<eos> I mean, you're basically just describing how to win at Monopoly.<eos> Look here. Those people you pushing out got names, like Nekeisha and Bobby.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Okay, you guys, come on.<eos> - I mean, this is complicated.<eos> - No, no, it's simple, Maxine. Jerrod gentrified me and Nekeisha out our own neighborhood.<eos> And now I got to move back in with Mom and Dad.<eos> You're blaming me for this, Bobby?<eos> You were living with Mom and Dad this morning.<eos> It's really not that big of a move, man.<eos> I can't believe you gentrified a member of your own family.<eos> You two are brothers!
I thought you rather liked poetry.<eos> I once loved poetry, but now it hurts my ears... to hear of things I will never know again.<eos> Such as?<eos> Love.<eos> I am two fools, I know. For loving, and for saying so.<eos> Have you ever considered that the love you think you have lost was never worth pursuing?<eos> I know how you feel about John Alden, but he will simply never be your equal. And you know it.<eos> Love is a conversation.<eos> You cannot deny, our words mingle as free and equally as our lips might, if you but let them.<eos> You think John Alden is the man who stands between you and I?
Patience, Little Lady.<eos> You'll have to wait for the leftovers.<eos> He don't understand the speech of animals.<eos> Speech of animals?<eos> The little darling.<eos> She says she's just been biting your father's burning balls in Hell.<eos> What?<eos> ! No.<eos> No, not you.<eos> You two are witches.
I'm no puppet!<eos> I fought. I rebelled. I am free!<eos> Then act now... freely.<eos> Disobey my son.<eos> Free?<eos> Hardly.<eos> You just found somebody else to pull your strings.<eos> You are out of danger... for the moment.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The question is what do you want?
Is it true? Magic might disappear?<eos> Only if Henry destroys the crystal.<eos> Which he won't, not with Emma and Regina searching for him.<eos> Yeah, but what if they don't find him in time?<eos> How are we gonna get back without magic?<eos> It won't be a problem if we send you home now.<eos> We?<eos> I think you mean me, dear.<eos> But this time, summon the portal without the twister?<eos> You heroes ruin all the fun.
We'll be cut off from Storybrooke for good.<eos> Hold on, I hear something.<eos> Excuse me. Can you tell us what land we're in? Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> No need to run!<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> We just want to know what land we're in.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You don't need to be afraid of us.<eos> No, you don't understand.
Should I be offended that he didn't frisk me?<eos> Not that this is any use to us in here.<eos> Hid it. Someone's coming.<eos> There you are.<eos> The prisoners who attacked my groundsman.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We didn't attack anyone.<eos> This is just a big misunderstanding.<eos> We just want to know where we are.<eos> All you need to know is that you don't want to be here, and that you're the ones who are going to be answering my questions.
I-I-I was a doctor, b-before the Warden took control and ruined everything.<eos> He... he made me a prisoner.<eos> Look, we need magic so I can fix this wand.<eos> I-I know exactly where to go.<eos> The hospital lab, but... I can't take anything without the Warden knowing that it's missing.<eos> You'll have to give the pieces to me so I can fix it there. Then I'll bring them back.<eos> Please understand, that wand is our only way home.<eos> Okay, so why should we trust you?<eos> You've met the Warden.<eos> Trust me, I want to get away from him as much as you do.
So he hit something or someone.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey. Think you ever would've run out of crazy medical terms to say to me?<eos> Would you let the door hit you in the face as you entered?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Okay, let's do this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I came here from Chicago and didn't know anyone. I didn't really want to know anyone.<eos> But you were kind, patient, funny.
Russell, good luck with the baby.<eos> Scotland, the brave."<eos> But that makes no sense in this context.<eos> But it's what's in my heart.<eos> And you should say what's in yours.<eos> Okay.<eos> When I started this job,<eos> I thought it would be gratifying to help victims of homicide through my forensic work, which it has been, and also, so much more.<eos> This adventure has made me more alive.<eos> And you have been the big family I never had.
She taught me how to live.<eos> She changed everything.<eos> First time I ever did a line of coke... was with Monica.<eos> We loved a lot.<eos> We fought a lot.<eos> Every time I look into one of...<eos> You kids's faces, I see her face looking back at me...<eos> Smiling, laughing.<eos> She was strong.<eos> And you're strong.

Look, she's nice to me. I just ...<eos> I just wanted to help.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa!<eos> Jeremy, Jeremy, hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me, all right?<eos> Look. Hey, look at me!<eos> Let's talk about this, okay?<eos> Yeah, come away from the ledge, man.<eos> - You don't know what it's like!
- ...to the front.<eos> ...if you just tell me about the case.<eos> Uh, I think you're a little bit confused.<eos> We ask the questions.<eos> How is it exactly you think you can help us?<eos> - I know who did it.<eos> - You do. The victim was impaled, right?<eos> And the killer left flowers behind.<eos> Just cut to the chase, Ms. Caspary.<eos> You are looking for a ghost.
Tell me what I should think, Charles.<eos> Local hospitals wouldn't approve the use of a new drug cocktail.<eos> Too much liability, they said.<eos> So Dr. Morgan treated Jennie at a private clinic<eos> - in New Hampshire. Until...<eos> - Until Mallon Hospital agreed to let him give the drugs to his patients.<eos> You were right about one thing, detectives.<eos> My wife did love Dr. Morgan.<eos> So did I. He was saving her.<eos> I have no idea why they were killed, and it seems like you don't either, so... unless I'm under arrest...
Her name isn't in it, but eventually he'd figure out what number's hers.<eos> All right, uh, write her number down, okay? And ...<eos> And maybe we'll get lucky and find it.<eos> - Okay? - Jane.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Her name's Daisy.<eos> Hi, Daisy. Hi. You're so cute.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> We'll provide you with a new home outside Boston, help you get a job, and establish a new life.<eos> What you have to do is cooperate with our investigation and abide by the laws of the Commonwealth. Okay.
Yeah, and no prints on the evidence box,<eos> - but we will do a full battery of tests.<eos> Kent? What are you working on?<eos> Oh, I, uh... I found him in the pond by my house this morning.<eos> - Is it sick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Won't even take any water, not even this fancy stuff with added electrolytes and vitamins. I got you a few liters I stuck on your desk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, you're both healing.<eos> You ladies deserve the best.
Well, if the water was polluted, a duck can contract botulism.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Good one, Sergeant.<eos> When I was a kid, my aunt had a place up on Lake Winnipesaukee.<eos> I used to feed the ducks. We may have some antitoxin on hand.<eos> Or you can just give it water with Epsom salt.<eos> - Right!<eos> Old wives' remedy.<eos> - The old wives are the ones that gave me the bread to feed the ducks.<eos> You know, you two are alike.
We ran right through the last batch.<eos> - Italian is my favorite.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Frankie's been teaching me to cook.<eos> - We did chicken parm last week.<eos> - Well... - that's a first.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Well, he only cooks for me on Mother's Day.<eos> Maybe I'll get him to work on that.<eos> You two seem to have a lot in common, don't you?
Unhh! Okay.<eos> Well, it appears my evening is free.<eos> Dirty Robber?<eos> Oui. Ça a l'air fantastique.<eos> C'est von b... blblblblblbl.<eos> - Oh, he's cute.<eos> - I know!<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Oh. I may have to go back to my afternoon shift.<eos> - You people are exhausting.
So we've located a surveillance camera on a warehouse about a block away from where Robin Daughtry was murdered.<eos> And?<eos> And it was running when she was attacked, when she pulled off her attacker's mask.<eos> From a block away?<eos> What did it see?<eos> Well, the image has to be enhanced.<eos> We may have to call the FBI, but we'll get it done.<eos> Or you could just save us the trouble.<eos> You can confess.<eos> We make it easy for you, you make it easy for him?
But what do you think?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Fine?<eos> ! Why aren't you attacking us with unwanted physical affection?<eos> Yeah, and I reached into the depths of my soul to write you that song.<eos> You wrote that song for your father... When you wanted to go on a ski trip.<eos> I did not... know you knew about that.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I give you my everything 364 days a year.<eos> Is it too much to ask to have one day where you do something for me?
You want me one-on-one, you got it. One little thing:<eos> I'm gonna use this and they're gonna hold you. No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Huh? What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You have the same story?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, nothing's going on here.<eos> Then why don't you three get away from him, and go to your cells?
- Goddamn!<eos> The surge.<eos> - The what?<eos> OK.<eos> Couple years before Wynonna came to town we all felt it.<eos> It was this... powerful rippling throughout the Ghost River Triangle.<eos> We didn't think anything of it.<eos> - The Heir was dead.<eos> - But I'm not, am I?<eos> Aw, you two got a beef, huh?
- Bobo.<eos> It's always been Bobo.<eos> He cuts and I bleed.<eos> Money, dignity, my very soul.<eos> He's reduced me to nothing.<eos> The way you reduced so many young delinquents, huh?<eos> Wow!<eos> Full circle.<eos> Pure poetry.<eos> You two could walk away from this prison.
See, I knew I wore this bracelet - for a reason.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, if we get out of here, we are getting dressed up way more often.<eos> What do you mean, "if we get out of here?"<eos> Just stay by the exits, OK?<eos> - Willa.<eos> - Hey, come.<eos> - I saw all that, you know.<eos> - Not now, Champ.<eos> So you two are, like, together now, eh?
Did you miss me?<eos> - I never miss.<eos> Doc!<eos> You can't shoot them.<eos> I hate them and they hate me, but they're still humans.<eos> Hey, listen, we gotta get you out of here.<eos> I hope my sisters made it out OK.<eos> - Don't worry, we'll find them.<eos> - No, I'll find them.<eos> You get something that will turn the townspeople from rabid, drugged-up assholes back into regular assholes!
If you need me, we're there.<eos> Where are your saviors now?<eos> No!<eos> What are you?<eos> I'm Level 6.<eos> Turin, what the hells do you want?<eos> I want you to take some unofficial assignments.<eos> Let's call 'em unsanctioned warrants.<eos> So this is the deal.<eos> You use me; I use you.
And we will help her mend it.<eos> Clay, and Nick, and myself.<eos> We will take care of her because we're her family.<eos> Now, you and your other two children will be safe and free.<eos> But in exchange, you will never see Elena again.<eos> - Good faith negotiations.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I must come to a place of your choosing.<eos> Unarmed.<eos> And, you have Konstantin as your hostage.
Dude, she is so into me, man.<eos> I mean, she's already trying to make me jealous.<eos> She keeps talking about you.<eos> Classic chick.<eos> I like you, Perrin.<eos> You remind me of me when I was your age, but with cheaper shoes and less confidence.<eos> I just can't believe you are pawning me off on some stranger like I'm a kid with an overbite and a helmet nobody wants to be buddies with.<eos> No, no, not a stranger.<eos> Bonnie is a close, dear person that I know.<eos> And, I just, I think you two would have a lot in common.
And for that, you must respect each other.<eos> You're here because you have a problem.<eos> But the problem isn't the person beside you.<eos> That person is part of the solution, so you must listen to him.<eos> And third, I have no stake in this.<eos> I support no one.<eos> I decide nothing.<eos> I only ease communication.<eos> I make you think.<eos> You are the only ones who can take decisions.
No, not yet.<eos> We're working on it, Natalia.<eos> Natalia, I said not yet!<eos> - Well, it's between you two.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Fuck that.<eos> - That's the result.<eos> - Now what?<eos> Now what?<eos> If you want, you two could have a draw.
Listen.<eos> Will you just listen?<eos> No, you listen.<eos> Davis is more likely to connect with you than anyone.<eos> I suggest you talk to him.<eos> Sniper to sniper.<eos> That's right, Popeye.<eos> Taft told me enough.<eos> Fact is, you and Davis, I couldn't have found a better match.<eos> You snipers are a very difficult breed.
- All the same, maybe it's time to start treating her like an enemy combatant, and less like our nation's favorite houseguest.<eos> You want to take a terrified young woman to a black site for enhanced interrogation.<eos> - Yeah, hello.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay. - 'Cause this approach does not.<eos> Guys, that decision might not be ours to make anymore.<eos> Alex Jones from White House Counsel wants to see us right away.<eos> I don't think you understand the dangerous position you've put the White House in.<eos> At your urgent request, President Dalton authorized Justice to issue an arrest warrant, so you could legally rendition Hijriyyah Al Bouri.
- What else could you have done?<eos> - I could have gone up to ortho.<eos> Looked for somebody to take his arm off.<eos> we can't intentionally maim a patient.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> All I'm saying... are the decisions we're making or are they in ours?<eos> To make us feel better?<eos> that's a happy ending.<eos> - Mr. Patrick...<eos> - You didn't know her.
Absolutely.<eos> Lenore, are you okay?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Okay. We lied.<eos> What?<eos> Wh-What?<eos> I'm sorry, what were you talking about?<eos> Your father.<eos> He's here with that new girlfriend of his.<eos> - What were you talking about?
And then invest that money.<eos> Why did he need to be saved?<eos> We kind of poached T-Sizzle and we caught some fire for it.<eos> Who exactly did you kind of poach him from?<eos> - Miami Wealth Management. - Andre?<eos> Andre.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> This is a joke?<eos> You're taking this on the road?<eos> You are minnows.
Get my pray on.<eos> Where y'all ladies from anyway?<eos> - New Orleans.<eos> TTD put you up to this.<eos> Yeah, well, he figured we could help you make a decision.<eos> New Orleans has some of the best Baptist services in the South.<eos> Perfect for a man of faith.<eos> And I have some great real estate contacts.<eos> I can get you a sick place to live.<eos> Huh. So you ladies are like the board of tourism in bikinis.
Whoo! Here we go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who wants a root beer float, huh?<eos> Oh, all right. Okay.<eos> Okay, so what is this?<eos> Molly's Junior.<eos> Some root beer floats.<eos> There we go. I guess it's better than nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here you go, kids.
Start time... 23:58.<eos> 10 blade. So we'll be up next, Cross.<eos> Where's he taking you?<eos> Did he say?<eos> Let it go.<eos> You still haven't canceled that yet?<eos> What part of "let it go" is confusing?<eos> Lap pads.<eos> I guess there's still time.<eos> This is gonna be a very long night if you two keep hounding me about this.
Of course not.<eos> What else did you think a topless-maid service did, Kev?<eos> I was focused on the maid part and not the topless part, which gave me this idea.<eos> - Nooks and Fannies?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We are gonna start a maid service that is not only topless but also cleans;<eos> we'll corner the market.<eos> You expect me to clean someone else's house?<eos> Don't have to. That's the genius part.<eos> You two are the boobs of the operation.
Too raven.<eos> This will end poorly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is the first and last step to opening my dry cleaning business.<eos> So, we eat here for free?<eos> I never realized being the husband of a local news celeb would be so sweet!<eos> Ah, the perks are nice, but remember:<eos> I'm doing all this to help Greg.<eos> Complimentary order of shrimp enchiladas.<eos> Mwah! The veins in the shrimp are... how you say?
- Yes?<eos> Yes? I mean... I mean, why are you asking me?<eos> - I'm not Meredith.<eos> - We have to move up the news plug.<eos> Did you think I was Meredith? Do I look like Meredith?<eos> They need you on the air in five.<eos> Meredith, we've got big banner problems.<eos> Not now. I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Please, can you give us some space?<eos> Yes, can you all give us some space?
And this little guy spit up on it.<eos> Sometimes I just want to... (imitates bone cracking)<eos> Kidding! You're papa's little everythings.<eos> Snotron, buddy, I'd love to see that health grade go up from a "C" minus to an "A."<eos> Or... How about a free drink for the mayor?<eos> A Capri two suns?<eos> Mr. Mayor, we're back from the dilithium crystal mine.<eos> What a haul!<eos> This will power the colony for months!<eos> MAN: God, what are you children doing?
No!<eos> Ty-Ty, go long!<eos> What the hell is this? !<eos> It's bad enough no one comes to our games, and we don't get to practice on the varsity field.<eos> We don't need your nerd crap in our way!<eos> Our colony is under new management, and like Charlotte, North Carolina, we are both fast-growing and completely devoid of culture.<eos> Did Charlotte, North Carolina, just get dadded?<eos> No, Barry, "American Dad" loves everyone now.<eos> That's right, America.<eos> We want you to know you are loved!
Kid must have been rigged with the explosives.<eos> Techs say they found shrapnel and remnants of what appears to be a suicide vest.<eos> The M.E. puts the boy's age at around 11 years old.<eos> 11-year-old suicide bomber?<eos> I know. I... I have an 11-year-old son.<eos> All right, we're happy to help.<eos> Why'd you call us? Initial tests indicate that the explosive was made of Binetex.<eos> Binetex isn't on the streets.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And you worked a Binetex case with ATF in November.
Are we buying their story?<eos> Warming up to it.<eos> Dawn, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> James said it had to be a secret until he resigned from the Navy.<eos> Wow, you wrote some pretty, uh, pretty crazy poems there.<eos> Her life's work is about humanity, about lifting people up.<eos> I never knew those feelings before.<eos> James has devoted himself to making a difference.<eos> He's liberated hundreds of girls from a life of slavery.<eos> He's not who you think he is.
I know you.<eos> This isn't about a feather.<eos> I don't know what it's about.<eos> Well, whatever it is, just talk to her about it.<eos> Put it out in the open, deal with your pain.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But right now, let's get Hyde the hell out of town.<eos> - Oh, don't avoid this.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> But you of all people should know... heroism comes first.
And Jorge?<eos> He buried the sheriff's body.<eos> He took extra care, like you asked.<eos> None of this should have happened.<eos> Karen deserved better.<eos> Jeremy, I know how you're feeling, but don't let that cloud your judgment.<eos> None of this will stop as long as Roman's still alive.<eos> You don't have to go after him alone.<eos> Let us help you.<eos> I'm going to do what I must, and so will you.
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> It's been hectic.<eos> I sold the cosmetics company.<eos> Savannah and I are packing up and moving to Portland.<eos> There's just... too many bad memories on the East coast.<eos> Well, what's in Portland?<eos> Should I ask who is in Portland?<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> Does this, um... lawyer have a name?<eos> You werewolves, always looking for the hunt.
To protect him?<eos> I warned her about the red-eyed wolf.<eos> Maybe she thought that taking the baby was the only way to make sure he was safe.<eos> That wolf slaughtered their mother.<eos> She would be terrified if she knew he was here.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but what other reason could she have?<eos> Nick's heading northeast.<eos> Tell him to focus on tourist spots where she can blend in.<eos> No, I will find her.<eos> Okay, you two go and meet up with Nick, track Katia as a team.
Axl, I don't get this.<eos> You're always great with women. You have so many moves.<eos> Why do you even need me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just kind of in a slump or something.<eos> Okay, here's the thing.<eos> A couple weeks ago, I saw Devin with some skater guy, and she was all, like, laughing and throwing her hair back.<eos> You know how girls do that?<eos> No. Cindy never laughs.<eos> But I thought you and Devin broke up.
That's my boy!<eos> Okay, guys! Who's ready to rock?<eos> Is this some kind of pre-show meditation thing?<eos> Oh boy, um, so just to be clear... you guys don't want to go on... because you're wearing matching shirts?<eos> I offered to wear the same shirt so that we could all match.<eos> Shut up, Val!<eos> Okay... well, obviously one of you is gonna have to change.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna change... okay?<eos> It's the front man's job to really standout... you know, to be the face of the band.<eos> If anything, you two should probably... just match the backdrop.
24 is the number of EPA sanctions leveled against Doyle Energy last year.<eos> Let's start again.<eos> Did you break Susan?<eos> Because your girlfriend is in a death spiral.<eos> Just fix it, okay?<eos> "Pencils down."<eos> We all remember those dreaded words from school.<eos> When you heard them, it meant you were out of time.<eos> That's a feeling our Republican presidential hopefuls can relate to.<eos> With only two days left before their first debate, they're cramming like crazy in preparation for the most important test of their lives... a test, my dear Lovers of Liberty, that you will be grading.
What? My episode of Cops.<eos> I just want to tell my peeps when to watch.<eos> 2.2, all cash.<eos> Three-day close. Take it or leave it.<eos> Can you, uh, hang up the phone and have a seat, please, Ms. Lee?<eos> Look, I'm really sorry to hear about Brandon.<eos> But I don't know how I'm supposed to help.<eos> I haven't seen him in over ten years.<eos> Which is exactly the amount of time that he's been dead.<eos> And according to Carl Collins, you two had a pretty nasty breakup right before he was murdered. Carl Collins?
We're here to talk about Seth Lang.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, it's really sad what happened to him.<eos> Were you close with him?<eos> Yeah, you know, he wasn't one of those, uh, standoffish stars. He was... he was close with everyone.<eos> So you want to tell us why you were at his house every night, before he was murdered?<eos> I'll tell you what, let's head over to the rink.<eos> If Seeley gives me a penalty shot rematch, we can finally settle this debate.<eos> There's no debate.<eos> I took the shot, it went in, we won, you lost, life goes on.
You must have been quite humiliated when you realized you'd damaged Captain Frank's remains.<eos> You brought me back in here for that?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> The damage was minor.<eos> Really, minor, like this size?<eos> That is a chip of 150-year-old C4 vertebra.<eos> My lab found it embedded in Henry Charles' brain.<eos> See, we figured out that this piece of bone got stuck in your ice Axe... the one that you used to manhandle Captain Frank's remains.<eos> The bone then migrated to Henry Charles' brain when you killed him with the very same Axe.<eos> You have no idea what I was up against.
Small holding.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, in any event, I believe Ms. Masters is correct.<eos> We should go inside.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I know this game you play.<eos> I will not invite you in to amass some bogus evidence against me.<eos> Look, I'll just come back later with a warrant.<eos> Well, you may attempt to do so, but as you venture down that futile path, a word to the wise: Rousseau's ridiculous manhunt cost him his job in France.<eos> I can only hope... you will not meet the same fate.

Previously on Salem...<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> You're still reeling from the loss of your powers. In time, you will once again get used to being a mere creature.<eos> You ever think you knew a man and come to find out you didn't know what he was at all?<eos> Real witches walked free and still do.<eos> If only I could get one, and I know which one I want...<eos> Mercy. We can become anything.<eos> We might even fashion ourselves into the rulers of Salem.<eos> You think John Alden is the man who stands between you and I?
The sad ballad of Billy who weren't really a man.<eos> I kind of want at least one person to know... who I was... and why.<eos> The Indians scalped my father in front of me.<eos> Rounded up the women, tied us together like livestock, dragged us into the woods.<eos> The Abenaki raped my sister and slit her throat.<eos> All the while, my mother kept saying,<eos> "Your uncles will come for us.<eos> They'll hire the great John Alden to ransom us."<eos> She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> But you never came.
Come see.<eos> It wasn't I who took all this from you. But it gives me great pleasure to be the one to restore it to you.<eos> I don't know how you knew, but you were right.<eos> This is what I wanted.<eos> I see you have not lost your touch.<eos> Destroying an Essex Witch with the very tree from which he derived his powers.<eos> I had to act.<eos> I have sown mistrust between Mary and the Hive.<eos> Once again, I have done all that you've asked of me.<eos> So the time has come for you to... No.
Hayward's hull-down on the horizon. Let's close the distance.<eos> Sea Dragon's out there.<eos> We'll have surprise, but not for long.<eos> O.O.D., all ahead full.<eos> Nathan James, this is Shackleton.<eos> We have a SKUNK 14 miles out, heading north at 32 knots.<eos> Roger, Shackleton.<eos> Sea Dragon's hauling ass.<eos> Hayward, this is Nathan James. Do you have SKUNK?<eos> Nathan James, I'm looking at the same picture you are.
I'm tossing you the hell out.<eos> - You're fired, Allison.<eos> - There's nobody to call, Howard.<eos> The lines have been cut.<eos> Since the disaster at sea, the White House has been put on lock-down on your orders.<eos> On my orders?<eos> Are you joking?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Potters, Leonard.<eos> In you go.<eos> You may think me ignorant, Drum, but I ain't no imbecile.<eos> You and your Mathilda, her hand on your thomas, taking your loyalty from you, plotting how best we here might be embarrassed!<eos> What do you say, fake?<eos> Is it in fact you, you talk of?<eos> Your knackers still chafed from that pony's backside?<eos> Thatcher.<eos> What horseplay is this?<eos> We have urgent business to get about and you two stop for a cuddle.
You best to have proven your words than you have with your fist strength.<eos> Thatcher, explain to me how you have allowed this fight to develop.<eos> As I say, Inspector, it's this wet soaked clown...<eos> Sergeant, I know why you might hope to batter the man.<eos> I am more concerned that you have found yourself unable.<eos> See, his reach is longer than yours.<eos> And he is a slight more calculating.<eos> In order to fight such a man, you must now before you begin that you will win.<eos> I do that by way of demonstration, of how you might in the future overcome your disadvantages.<eos> You did not mind, do you, Sergeant Drummond?
I believe the records would have their uses when I took them.<eos> I hadn't anticipated imitation, however.<eos> Gonna have to screw down hard, prise the flesh away.<eos> How charming.<eos> Yes, men's work, I believe.<eos> Shall we?<eos> - Let us.<eos> I will stop just a moment or two.<eos> Then we shall be on our way.<eos> Mr. Dove, appointments are there to be made, but you, it seems, feel yourself above the simple act of a knock upon a door.
Open this door!<eos> Quick, up into the lighting rigs.<eos> - Miss Morton?<eos> - Yes. I'm for a show, lady.<eos> One man here, other stage door.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> No lights?<eos> There, I'll...<eos> Look at that, the theater.<eos> So it's the case that you and Captain Jackson once stepped out?
You OK, Mimi?<eos> I will not have you soft-soap me either.<eos> Perhaps after all we have overstayed our welcome.<eos> Jedediah Shine is not a man I would have set any further sights on you.<eos> Come.<eos> It's becoming dark.<eos> We may go find ourselves alternative concealment.<eos> And then when you're caught and your severed heads are displayed on the iron railings that line the new station house on Leman Street,<eos> I shall have eternal guilt to add to the catalog of vexations I suffer as a result of you coming back into my life.<eos> No, this profanity is part of some strategy that, at its end, sees you restored, these two gone away, and that man Dove punished for all he has done.

But the woman Chudley must eat and sleep.<eos> And the gardens, Mr. Dove's gardens, they're bordered at the back only by the Marshes.<eos> And that puppy must be exercised.<eos> I see, Leonard.<eos> Albeit slight, there are opportunities there.<eos> There are.<eos> How do you find Mr. Dove?<eos> Too upright by half, yes, he was.<eos> And he's distracted by something which makes him fearful anxious.<eos> Leonard, do you think it's possible, as always of course being most careful, that you may discover what it is that makes him so anxious?
Certainty?<eos> Well, that is a luxury in my experience, sir.<eos> Nonetheless, Sergeant Drummond, you will please send to the yard.<eos> Yes, Mr. Dove.<eos> Sirs, the press come.<eos> Mr. Dove, might I have some confirmation concerning the dead man's body recovered this morning from Halfmoon Passage?<eos> Has this force once more assumed their tormentor dead when he is not?<eos> There are over 15 witnesses all describing the work done to the body.<eos> What use are we to you, then, girl?<eos> Mr. Dove, you are the ranking officer here. May I have it from you? Assistant Commissioner.
Brother.<eos> Hello, Mr. Reid.<eos> Captain, you seem very sure of yourself, sir.<eos> Of certain things, Mr. Reid, yes, I am.<eos> And so how will you explain your kinship with this man when the men of H Division arrive?<eos> Augustus?<eos> The men of H Division cannot arrive if they are not instructed to do so.<eos> And yet they are so instructed.<eos> By these instructions?<eos> Those you handed to your daughter?
Jill... !<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> She's a waitress.<eos> You know how they are.<eos> Hey, I'm a waitress.<eos> Yeah, and you slept with your married boss, a drunk fireman, your ex-husband's future father-in-law...<eos> Fine!<eos> I'm a whore.<eos> But I don't think Andrea's lying about Adam.<eos> So the real question is, if you were my Mom, would you want to know?
You had an incredible day!<eos> You got to ride like 20 rides in 10 minutes!<eos> You got to go ahead of Green Day.<eos> Did you see puss on Tré Cool?<eos> And you know what's worse?<eos> Not one person has even said thank you.<eos> Gee, thanks, Dad.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Not sincere.<eos> You monsters are dead to me!
Uh, well, stay calm.<eos> Uh, we're home, we flew in last night. Oh. Come on.<eos> She's gonna want to talk to Luke.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> I'm coming to you from West Virginia.<eos> What are you girls doing today?<eos> Oh, you know, me and Alex just out shopping.<eos> Who are you talking to? Dad.<eos> Who are you talking to?
Oh! So you're the big sissy!<eos> Here.<eos> Her lipsticks!<eos> Oh. I suppose you're gonna read into this, too.<eos> Wow, those sausages smell fantastic!<eos> You all right, Dad?<eos> Yeah, I guess I could say a few words.<eos> I appreciate you guys honoring me on this great holiday.<eos> But I'm not the only dad here.<eos> You three lucked out a little bit in that department, right?
Dad, come on.<eos> We may have ruined your day, yes, but now you're just spiraling.<eos> I mean, every relationship has its issues, and Gloria adores you!<eos> Take the win.<eos> You think?<eos> Papa was so handsome.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right!<eos> You each have a sausage on your plate I selected based on your individual personality and temperament.
Go save a company.<eos> And you save the world.<eos> Bye.<eos> In 100 feet, stay to the left.<eos> Drive through the gate.<eos> The security guard will wave you through.<eos> Welcome to The Farm.<eos> This is the CIA's one and only training facility.<eos> If you're here, that means you're very good, but that doesn't mean you'll stay.<eos> Over the next 24 hours, you'll undergo a battery of tests to determine who will go from Agency asset to operative.
- There's no such thing.<eos> That's what the FBI teaches you, but at the Agency, we rely on them.<eos> Right place, right time -- that can save your life.<eos> And now, with both of you here, that just doubles our odds.<eos> Look, the FBI and the CIA used to be able to do whatever they wanted in the name of national security, but over the years, laws have been passed rightfully -- to keep us from crossing the line.<eos> We believe that some people in the Agency decided they're done with these laws.<eos> They want the old ways restored -- no accountability, no rules, no oversight.<eos> Now, whoever this rogue group is, they've been growing within the CIA for years with their own nefarious agenda, and we need to stop them.<eos> The recruitment is happening on The Farm, and we believe Owen Hall, who is the head instructor, is finding the right candidates and indoctrinating them while training them right alongside the other students.<eos> So we need you to get close to your fellow recruits, figure out who may be chosen, and, if you can, get chosen yourself.

I will not let you go!<eos> Take my hand!<eos> I can't!<eos> I can't!<eos> Here!<eos> Grab my pack!<eos> - Ryan!<eos> - Come on, Lydia!<eos> Try not to do that again.<eos> You two still have to go.
I've made that jump 57 times.<eos> I'm not a recruit.<eos> I'm a case officer -- and your co-instructor.<eos> I put myself amongst you to observe you throughout the day.<eos> So there was nothing wrong with your rigging.<eos> No, it was a test to see who would try and play a hero during an op.<eos> I had a feeling it might be you.<eos> And after that little story you told at the bar, I was certain.<eos> The FBI might train you to be a hero, but in the Agency, the mission comes first.<eos> You don't.
We don't mind if you canoodle at the table. We don't mind if you canoodle at the table.<eos> ‐ Love is love.<eos> Go on, kiss.<eos> Ooh! ‐ I don't care what Dr. Ben Carson says.<eos> I like when nice men kiss.<eos> ‐ DeNeil, why don't you go get the dessert?<eos> And Billy, go with him.<eos> ‐ Everybody loves me.<eos> ‐ What the hell are you doing?<eos> You two hate everyone!

What could you possibly gain?<eos> Your son was born when you were only 14.<eos> Which would make him... 43 now?<eos> Your family was ashamed.<eos> So he was raised away from you.<eos> But you never lost touch with him.<eos> Have you always lived on the sappy side, or did that come out when you became a mother?<eos> The only reason you warned Agent Hotchner about this storm is because your son had something to do with it.<eos> And now you need our help.<eos> Not as much as you need mine.
Turn around show me your hands.<eos> Whatever you're holding, drop it.<eos> But then it will break.<eos> Drop it or I will shoot you.<eos> I said drop it!<eos> Wait, hold! Everyone hold.<eos> Asher, if you show us what you're holding and it isn't dangerous, we'll let you keep it.<eos> Why would it be dangerous?<eos> Because we're with the police and we have to be prepared for the worst.<eos> You're not the police.

How are they getting out?<eos> Freeze!<eos> You got a flashlight?<eos> Captain, we got a tunnel.<eos> Rossi, we got a tunnel in C-block along the sewer line on the east wall.<eos> Copy, Tara.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Evening.<eos> Including Rawdon?<eos> Kershaw and Bring, you stay here in case more prisoners come back through.
We can't find anything.<eos> We called off the search around seven o'clock to watch MacGyver.<eos> No problem.<eos> Just get the duty-free boxes from under the sink in the kitchen.<eos> Bridget...<eos> You smoked the last of the duty-frees this morning.<eos> There's no cigarettes left.<eos> Anyone who thinks I should cut down anyway, leave now!<eos> Frank, Eamon, Father.<eos> You stay.
- No relation?<eos> And you had him at our wedding.<eos> - Will you shut up!<eos> Stick on One there.<eos> MacGyver is starting.<eos> We don't have One.<eos> We only have Two.<eos> Well, I'm not watching RTE2 for the rest of my life.<eos> It's full of women wearing dungarees!<eos> I can get you a newish TV for nothing, but you'll have to do something for me.
I learnt my statistics at Lowpark.<eos> I'd help your mum out, but I'm a Lowpark boy, too.<eos> ♪ They're hard They're bad ♪ They don't know how to add<eos> ♪ Lowpark Boys Lowpark Boys! ♪<eos> Hey, guys. This just in -<eos> - Callum is coming over to meet you all.<eos> My boo.<eos> My beau.<eos> My beau-magnum man.<eos> It will be like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner except you know who's coming to dinner and Sidney Poitier won't be here.
To absent friends!<eos> ALL: Absent friends.<eos> Merry Christmas, everybody.<eos> PHONE RINGS That may be the Mother House calling early.<eos> Come with me, we'll take the call together.<eos> Here's Sister Monica Joan.<eos> Happy Christmas, Mother Jesu Emmanuel.<eos> I hope you've had the most blessed and peaceful day.<eos> I see.<eos> As you all doubtless know, our Order supports Hope Clinic, a tiny mission hospital in South Africa.
What happened?<eos> She was so pretty.<eos> So, Dad... what we're gonna do is, tomorrow morning, you and I are gonna go to that address, we're gonna ask around, and hopefully, we can find someone who knew her.<eos> Oh, well, thanks, Junior.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Well, good morning to you, too.<eos> Is that your second already this morning?<eos> It's my third, and I don't need you to lecture me on the evils of caffeine.<eos> GIBBS:<eos> Hope you two got something.
Sure.<eos> He shot himself twice.<eos> We found his suicide note.<eos> You deleted it off his laptop.<eos> But what you didn't know was that everything on that computer... is mirrored on the cloud.<eos> He was dead before you got here.<eos> Self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.<eos> BISHOP:<eos> Suicide.<eos> No way for you to collect on his insurance policy and you couldn't fake his murder on your own, because there was a witness.

Hi, Grumio.<eos> Is that Marcus under there by any chance?<eos> Er, found it.<eos> Found that pea I was looking for. Oh!<eos> Hi, Delphine.<eos> Fancy seeing you here.<eos> Feeling better, then?<eos> Er, yes, thanks.<eos> Er, turns out I don't know my body after all.<eos> So do you two know each other, then?
We can help.<eos> You don't have to do this by yourself.<eos> I know the two of you well enough to understand why you came when I said not to.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> Jeremy, we understand the risks.<eos> But surely...<eos> If you're arguing with me, Clayton, you don't understand all the risks.<eos> The only way to ensure that there's no blowback is for me to kill Roman alone.<eos> And that's why you two will take care of Roman's hitman.
Not him.<eos> $20,000.<eos> It's all there.<eos> Got a runner.<eos> Anthony DiNozzo.<eos> Senator?<eos> You know, I got to say, uh, you don't really look like your picture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, neither do you.<eos> You two are looking at 20 years for impersonating a federal agent and bribing a U.S. senator.
Of course.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> I haven't been to the inner sanctum in a while.<eos> Welcome back to Casa DiNozzo.<eos> I wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> And I get to say hello to Kate and Ziva in their cute little bowl.<eos> Yeah, Ziva's gained a little weight.<eos> You can drop by anytime.<eos> Senior does.<eos> I think it's really sweet that you two get to spend more time together.
I like him.<eos> Well, this is designed to protect you and, um, Fallon from wrongful termination.<eos> It creates a paper trail in case either of you is accused of impropriety.<eos> Impropriety?<eos> She's pursuing me.<eos> I'm the victim here.<eos> Fourth king.<eos> Make a rule.<eos> Okay.<eos> My rule is, anytime someone picks up a face card, you two kiss.
Yeah, me too.<eos> You know, just knowing how happy they are got me thinking about us.<eos> 'Cause I've wanted this, Caleb, for a really long time.<eos> - So have I.<eos> - And it's been great, but.. ...you know, everything changed once Hanna disappeared.<eos> Well, I promised to keep her safe.<eos> So I felt responsible.<eos> Yeah, but she's back now, and you still seem distant.<eos> So I keep on asking myself why.<eos> You two were alone together that night.
Where are you?<eos> What are we supposed to do now?<eos> Call Emily and Spencer.<eos> We have to pull the plug on this whole plan.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Well, when someone steals the car that you're about to torch your cover-up is kind of uncovered.<eos> It's the car.<eos> No way.<eos> Well, you two sure know how to ruin a surprise.
Toby, you're building her a house.<eos> You can build her a house anywhere.<eos> I need to be here right now but you and Yvonne don't.<eos> Please.<eos> No one's ever really safe in Rosewood.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom!<eos> I'm sorry, this is not how I thought tonight was gonna be.<eos> Hey, it's fine.<eos> Here you are, ladies.
He did.<eos> He was an OB/GYN.<eos> He lost his license years ago.<eos> Look, I really have to get back to work.<eos> I'm so sorry, Doctor, please.<eos> Is there any way that we can get in touch with your father?<eos> We-we just need to ask him a couple of questions.<eos> Look, I don't know where my father is.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in years.<eos> You two seem nice enough.
God only knows what's inside.<eos> Hopefully, the evidence we need to finally end this thing.<eos> Noel Kahn was there the whole time?<eos> We may not be able to prove that he tortured Hanna but this proves that he tortured us.<eos> I knew you'd eventually slip up.<eos> The cell phone was a big screw-up.<eos> Be careful, Hanna, or you'll end up just like Sara.<eos> If we do this, there's no stepping back from it.<eos> And we risk the police finding out about Archer.<eos> You mean, finding out that Hanna ran him over and you buried him like a dog?
- I'll be a sec. - Paige.<eos> Hi.<eos> He's giving me such a hard time about seeing you.<eos> Why are you here so early? Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, today is just the deadline for our job paperwork to be turned in.<eos> - Didn't want you to miss it. - Thanks.<eos> Did you sleep well last night?<eos> Yeah, uh..<eos> Ali's kind of having a rough time.<eos> I think you're all kind of going through a rough time.
Hey, you guys, there's something over here.<eos> None of this feels right.<eos> "Joseph Lloyd King.<eos> "School for the Blind.<eos> Established in 1873."<eos> I visited Jenna in a blind school in Philadelphia but not this place.<eos> The school operated here until 2009 and then it was relocated to Bridge County.<eos> So Jenna could have come here when she first lost her eyesight.<eos> I didn't lose my sight.<eos> 'You took it from me! '
Those... Those were good times.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Um... Dr. Holt, uh, if I am well enough, do you think that... I could take this beautiful young woman out for dinner tonight?<eos> Maybe give her a little bit of... sex after?<eos> Okay.<eos> I think I'm gonna go to my office.<eos> Um, girls, your rounds.<eos> Doctor...<eos> Now, you two have, uh, chemistry, huh?
Well, how?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Maybe, like, take sex classes or something?<eos> "Sex classes," number three?<eos> And where do you imagine they offer these sex classes?<eos> Chanel, if I may.<eos> I believe you're going about this all wrong.<eos> Maybe it isn't about the sex.<eos> Maybe it's about the cultural differences between yours and Brock's respective generations.<eos> Maybe he and Dean Munsch can bond over shared experiences in a way that you and he never can.
But you reported him as missing.<eos> Well, he didn't come home for three days.<eos> I thought he was dead in a ditch somewhere.<eos> We didn't find out about the women for a long time after.<eos> Is that... is that white sage?<eos> Yeah, you know your herbs.<eos> You, uh, planning on taking a trip?<eos> Uh, yeah. I'm going to stay with my sister a few weeks.<eos> For any reason?<eos> You're gonna think it's real out there.
Just find him.<eos> Promise me you'll find him.<eos> We will.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is supposed to help me, hm?<eos> Best friend?<eos> They weren't meant to arrest Yann!<eos> There was a plan, Matthew.<eos> A perfect plan where you didn't get hurt.<eos> But you share the same fucking hairbrush, you boys, don't you?
Is that why Olivia left?<eos> Partly.<eos> I see.<eos> It... It was never my intention to cause harm.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Fox.<eos> Should the seemingly inevitable transpire,<eos> James will need a friend.<eos> I forced him to marry once.<eos> I shan't do it again.<eos> I count on you to teach him what I imagine you already know... how to be as you are whilst avoiding scandal.
No one who'd want to hurt her.<eos> No.<eos> She was... heartsore.<eos> I should have seen how bad.<eos> - Sorry. I didn't mean...<eos> - It is best left there. I...<eos> All right. Come on.<eos> Right there. Come on.<eos> What time is it?<eos> You countrymen are always up with the larks.
You can reason with her?<eos> Well... I doubt that.<eos> But I can lock her away.<eos> This time for good.<eos> Done it before.<eos> Oh, Pops didn't tell you that, huh?<eos> Once you've... gotten rid of her, you'll want... to... stay around?<eos> Oh, I like the way you think.<eos> Man, am I jazzed!<eos> Hey. If it makes you comfy, could call me God.
You with us?<eos> The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?<eos> You got it.<eos> Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> But you do, so --<eos> Exactly!<eos> I do!<eos> This isn't a negotiation.<eos> I have the high cards, and you have --
- really sharp. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, thank you, but...<eos> - Tim, you want to walk them through it?<eos> Yeah, okay, so we can't do 1.4, but what if we aim for a leaner, meaner Mutiny Exchange? - You mean cheaper?<eos> - No, smarter.<eos> Doing more with less.<eos> Like, for instance, I think you can make do with half as many new hires as you have laid out in the prospectus.<eos> Yeah, and I think you can skip the server computer upgrades, at least initially.<eos> Less risk, more reward. - You know, let's just hold off on the... just for a second.<eos> - Does that sound good?<eos> What I'm hearing is that you want to lock us up by investing a fraction of what we're asking.

Oracle was the same deal.<eos> Investment grew over time.<eos> It's how things get done out here.<eos> Okay, so then how much money are you offering us?<eos> That is a number that we are still trying to figure out.<eos> That's what this was all about, getting the ball rolling, assuming that you are amenable.

Or it could be that all the guys that were out there when I was a kid are too busy running companies to have time for hams.<eos> Yeah, or they moved online.<eos> There must be some new kids out there.<eos> I'll be out in a sec.<eos> CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> Do you want me there because you think I might have something to contribute or because you want me to feel like I have something to do?
She was here for like an hour just staring.<eos> Dude, where've you been?<eos> I got hammered and passed out at Joe's.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Hey, was that fun?<eos> I don't know what the hell it was.<eos> Okay, that makes absolutely zero sense.<eos> Well, we thought it made a lot of sense.<eos> Well, you guys are the heads of the company.<eos> Of course you should be the ones to bring the offer over to SwapMeet.
Dougie, chill.<eos> My guys will flowchart it. I'll write out the flags...<eos> I'm sure you will.<eos> The flow chart would strangle us.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> And what do you mean your guys?<eos> It's fast and it fits.<eos> It's no longer necessary.<eos> Doug, we bought your company.<eos> You should adapt to our programming language.
Hey, wait.<eos> Come on, hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> It was great hanging out with you last night.<eos> - Can I just...<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Cool. I'll let you get back to work.<eos> I heard you two had a good conversation last night.
! Green!<eos> Green!<eos> Green!<eos> We feel 100% confident. If we're properly assigned, we can get this whole thing out the door in three weeks.<eos> Three weeks?<eos> That's much sooner than we expected, right?<eos> Oh, I just wish...<eos> Let it go.<eos> She's not coming.<eos> I thought you two had a good conversation.
Speedy, because I'm flying solo as the other guy.<eos> Ok, nice try.<eos> Talk to the controller about tax initiatives and councilman Garcia about sanitation.<eos> I also put the applications for deputy mayor on your desk.<eos> I'm going to go drink.<eos> What I do care about is what you promised me if I won tonight.<eos> None of yours.<eos> What?<eos> Whose?<eos> What are you two doing here?
Both of you.<eos> SCPD!<eos> We have you surrounded!<eos> Guns on the floor now!<eos> What is this?<eos> These aren't our guys.<eos> No. They're Los Halcones.<eos> See, they tried to rob you tonight.<eos> A shoot-out ensued.<eos> You killed them.
All right.<eos> Knocking.<eos> That's not like you.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> How long you been back in town?<eos> A couple weeks.<eos> Where's Donna?<eos> Uh, she's in Heaven.<eos> It's the casino in Vegas that she's waitressing at these days, not...<eos> So you two aren't...
You speak of her as if she is gone.<eos> I hate to see a lady so beautiful so sad.<eos> Your husband...<eos> Enjoys the company of his male courtiers.<eos> Why should I be denied similar... pleasures?<eos> Sara...<eos> I need to know that the Queen is secure.<eos> Meantime, I believe I've identified out assassins and I'd wager those aren't just swords on their hips.<eos> Ah, yes, that would explain the aberration.<eos> My love, there is no need for you to... knock.
A secret that the Germans apparently knew, so unless we can determine where they're keeping her while she manufactures their bomb...<eos> If I had to guess, I'd say she's with Damien Darhk's uranium.<eos> Damien Darhk?<eos> As in...<eos> The man who murdered your sister.<eos> How is Damien Darhk even alive in 1942?<eos> Thanks to the Lazarus Pit, he hardly ages.<eos> Sara's kind of an expert on Damien Darhk.<eos> - Drop it, Ray.<eos> - I'm sorry, but while you were all saving Einstein,
Hey, remember that thing that I said before about you being a...<eos> Billionaire Boy Scout?<eos> You weren't all wrong.<eos> Yeah, but... you're more than that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And we'll get justice for Laurel, Sara, promise.<eos> What do you guys say we get outta 1942?<eos> Not until you answer a few questions.<eos> We're the Justice Society of America.<eos> And you're coming with us.
But you first.<eos> Yes, well, before you murder us all, we do have a few questions about you, your brother,<eos> Hunters in America, and how you saved the sun.<eos> Right.<eos> You shoot me, kidnap me, but yeah, happy to help.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you, Sam.<eos> You gave me no choice.<eos> And, well, I could say it was never supposed to go this way, but you're...you.<eos> It was always going to go this way.<eos> And you know me?
- What?<eos> - Daddy, no, the fog!<eos> Johnny will do it.<eos> If something is wrong, we all die.<eos> - Then let me go!<eos> - No.<eos> Daddy, please stay.<eos> No.<eos> No, you both need to stay.<eos> You are the family now.
I'm sorry, what did you call me?<eos> You're Erik Estrada, right?<eos> Yeah, from CHiPs.<eos> You thought I was Erik Estrada?<eos> That guy's, like, 100.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Dude, calm down.<eos> - I will not calm down! There are, like, cops everywhere, man.<eos> Good. You should be arrested.<eos> I gave you guys my urine! And then you make this egregious racial and generational mistake!
El Oso?<eos> I said no names.<eos> Wait, El Oso?<eos> Head of the cartel?<eos> The Mexican government, the D.E.A., the FBI... They're all looking for this guy.<eos> He escaped from prison in Mexico three months ago. Are...<eos> Are you saying that you know where El Oso is hiding?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Then why would Zane come to see you?<eos> Because I got a little bird, and I put out my little bird to the right people until the message gets to you know who.
By offering you your big break directing the El Oso biopic?<eos> But it was a Hollywood promise.<eos> Not worth a damn.<eos> Tell me, did he confess to you that he would be directing the picture on his own, or did he just tell you you lost the job?<eos> Neither.<eos> Because it didn't happen.<eos> I-I don't know anything about an El Oso project.<eos> Then how do you explain the browser history on your laptop?<eos> Or the shoes in your closet with Zane's blood on them?<eos> You have no idea what a risk it was putting Zane in this play.
He's part of a new generation of anti-government bloggers.<eos> There's dozens of them, but this guy's the most influential.<eos> The Caliphate reprints him every chance they get.<eos> I wonder if he knows how much damage he's doing.<eos> There has been some chatter about something bigger planned, but we don't know where and we don't know when. At least not yet.<eos> I need better than that, General.<eos> Yup.<eos> So does Europe.<eos> So does the United States.<eos> You are our most important recruits.

At least not yet.<eos> I need better than that, General.<eos> Yup.<eos> So does Europe.<eos> So does the United States.<eos> You are our most important recruits.<eos> Because you're native Abuddinians.<eos> And when we march back into Abuddin, you will march in the front with me.
And I'm a stupid, stupid adult.<eos> Just leave, please.<eos> Leave!<eos> I want to know where your husband is.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> That's what your brother said, too.<eos> And I find that hard to believe.<eos> You don't think it's strange he just disappeared?<eos> I do.<eos> I assumed you had him.
But then others will rise up to replace them.<eos> I've seen this countless times, Mr. President.<eos> If you want to destabilize the Caliphate, you've got to think bigger.<eos> I get it, General, and when my army is back to fighting strength, that's exactly what we'll do.<eos> But first I want them dead.<eos> How do we do it?<eos> UAVs armed with air-to-surface missiles.<eos> Once we know where they are, we move.<eos> Then that's the plan.<eos> On this tragic day, with you and God as my witness, I announce my candidacy for president of Abuddin.
It's no secret he doesn't support me for president.<eos> You haul me in in front of the commission just as I begin my campaign, and I'm sure he'll be pleased.<eos> Well, you'd have to ask him that.<eos> We don't talk politics.<eos> Don't you think people wonder why a Bedouin woman with no education, no background was put in such an important position?<eos> That's a strange accusation coming from the daughter of a kitchen maid.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Be careful if you're in love with him.<eos> You'll think the connection you have is real. And who's to say?
I see you and blair are still attached at the hip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> Unlike you.<eos> Or you.<eos> I guess we, uh, kind of dropped the ball On keeping in touch, huh?<eos> It happens.<eos> You guys got it from here, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Were you two friends at camp?
So... what do you think?<eos> Gram, that looks exactly like your usual autograph.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> My usual autograph, when I am merely an actress, is like this, sort of carefree and... and whimsical, whereas the other conveys insight, wisdom.<eos> They're completely different. Can't you see that?<eos> - Insight.<eos> - Wisdom.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yes, absolutely.<eos> Good job. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run, especially since you-know-who is completely useless.
And I realized...<eos> I never want to be that person.<eos> I refuse to be ruled by fear.<eos> I refuse to be you.<eos> They're here.<eos> You guys know why we're here?<eos> Because there's something inside this building that's really important that we need.<eos> The only problem is these doors are locked, so we're gonna need your help to open them, okay?<eos> Want to know something cool?<eos> You two are special because you two are the keys.
Health officials say new safeguards will go up to prevent this from ever happening again. Great work, team.<eos> There was a million things that could've gone wrong today.<eos> Speaking of "gone wrong,"<eos> I just got my final rejection letter from a game show.<eos> I've got half a mind to sue.<eos> Half a mind is right-- no lawyer would take that case.<eos> That one would.<eos> Has anything terrible ever happened to you?<eos> Car accident?<eos> You know what to do? How about you?
- Damn it.<eos> - Right.<eos> But that contract was supposed to cover your medical expenses and that fakakta restaurant you're starting.<eos> - So transfer some money.<eos> - [Ruth] From where?<eos> You're no longer worth what you think you are, Mr. Restaurateur.<eos> Go screw yourself, Ruth.<eos> I'd love to, Aidan, but I'm too busy trying to keep your head above water.<eos> What am I paying you for?<eos> I thought you people were good with money.
- Sorry.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> Well, I'm only gonna need one or two of you.<eos> Because, uh, the main case has to continue.<eos> - It's a simultaneous approach.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You guys talking side story?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about you two keep things flowing here and Stew and I will chase something down?
You have to be very careful.<eos> Just give me trubel and eve.<eos> Okay. Let's go.<eos> What do you guys hope to do here?<eos> Shut up. You think kidnapping me is going to get you Some kind of freedom you didn't have.<eos> You know what's going on.<eos> You work with a grimm. I know the cost of whatever you get out of this<eos> Is gonna be very high.<eos> You're not wesen.<eos> You'll never understand.
Did he?<eos> Let me give you a bit of advice.<eos> Stay out of it.<eos> He did this in a precinct.<eos> You know how many witnesses there were to this?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> I'm sure you didn't.<eos> There are gonna be some serious changes.<eos> You're good cops.<eos> You understand what's really happening here.
All right.<eos> We're here.<eos> Don't try to pull any crap.<eos> And what variety of crap could I possibly pull?<eos> I've lost my grace.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Okay, why did you have to see us?<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> So, I, uh, notice you've been in touch with Chuck.<eos> A.K.A., you know who. Yeah, yeah.
I missed a few million birthdays.<eos> Yeah, and then the second your apes send a distress flare -- Boom!<eos> - - Daddy's home.<eos> No, that's not what happened.<eos> Hey, these apes saved your ass.<eos> He can't hurt you.<eos> Oh, so you're controlling me now.<eos> No, it's just a safeguard.<eos> Hey, guys, uh, Chuck, um...<eos> Lucifer, Dean... think we can try and focus here, you know?
They were both...<eos> She's a beauty.<eos> Your horse, Maddie.<eos> Well, I hope she takes it easy on me.<eos> Oh, she will.<eos> Won't you, Maddie?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> Ready as I'll ever be!<eos> Oh, you two are gonna be great.
Mr Urquhart!<eos> You left the party last night after an argument with the duke.<eos> Keep the volume down.<eos> Every word is like a nail in my skull.<eos> And approximately half an hour before the baby was found missing!<eos> Can I ask where you went?<eos> Up here, in search of a bed.<eos> You were conspicuous by your absence when all the drama was going on.<eos> I was as drunk as a skunk.<eos> Until recently, YOU were the duke's heir.
Maybe you can go there with me.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Dude, I'm having major déjà vu.<eos> In your defense, Sabrina is tres hot.<eos> Hot or not, I can't fall for another friend who's probably just gonna turn out to be straight.<eos> Wait. As in it's possible she's not?<eos> Your face says I'm right!<eos> Okay!<eos> Sabrina may have had a sexy female dream of her own, but you cannot tell a soul, especially Karma.<eos> And if Sabrina does decide she likes girls, then maybe you two can end up together.
You have no idea how much I noticed. Now we have to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I am not asking, Isabela.<eos> Come on. Get off of me.<eos> I don't want to leave!<eos> Isabela, we don't have time for this, come on.<eos> - Grow up.<eos> - I hate you!<eos> Well, you can hate me all you want and you can blame me for whatever you need.
Gotham's full of rough characters.<eos> You look great by the way.<eos> Wait over there.<eos> Please.<eos> Poor bunny.<eos> Break-ups are hard.<eos> I offered to kill you.<eos> I thought it would raise his spirits.<eos> It would be my pleasure seeing as how you murdered my mother!<eos> But he is nursing some foolish hope that you two will get back together.
Every one of you here has the opportunity to live an authentic life.<eos> But so far, it just ain't happening, is it?<eos> Why? Why is that?<eos> Because you're trapped, right?<eos> Isn't that why?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> That's how you feel.<eos> Stuck in a box that you can't get out of.<eos> Well, who made the box?<eos> You all think you want to be free.
Because you're trapped, right?<eos> Isn't that why?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> That's how you feel.<eos> Stuck in a box that you can't get out of.<eos> Well, who made the box?<eos> You all think you want to be free.<eos> Everything would be great, if only you didn't have this shit that you got to take care of, this crap that you got to worry about.<eos> Well, I've got news for you.<eos> You love your prison.
The only thing that matters to me is, did he do it?<eos> Go talk to Odell and take Frankie with you.<eos> - Is there a forensics issue?<eos> Something with the evidence?<eos> Odell's in prison.<eos> You've been in prison. Could be useful.<eos> Your new shirt doesn't cover all of your old prison tattoo.<eos> Great meeting you guys.<eos> My mom and I have written over 150 letters, trying to get someone to take another look at my case.<eos> You two joining the team, it... it means a lot. - Sure thing.
He's not.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because Eve is on it. She has a contact at the NYPD, so just relax.<eos> Wes is not a suspect.<eos> - Is Frank?<eos> - Laurel.<eos> You would tell me if you'd heard from him so that at least I'd know he's not dead.<eos> - Maybe he is.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> What are you girls gossiping about?
Fine.<eos> Let's say you were indeed abused.<eos> The police report states that there was no imminent threat at the time of the murder, so my question is, if your husband was abusing you so badly, why did you kill him instead of just leaving him?<eos> That is the wrong question.<eos> Quick recess.<eos> You're asking my client what's wrong with her when you should be asking what was wrong with the man that repeatedly battered...<eos> Connor, enough.<eos> Instead, you're putting the burden on the victim!<eos> Young man, you need to rein it in.<eos> My client has suffered a lifetime of horror, and you're just continuing the cycle of abuse, and I won't allow it!
And you need to dump her before this goes bad.<eos> Meggy's amazing.<eos> Why would he break up with her?<eos> None of us at this table are fit to date civilians.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> No, what's ridiculous is you dating doughnut-hole here when the only thing you guys have in common is murder.<eos> Can we not talk about this right here?<eos> Maybe I should date Waitlist. Or Laurel.<eos> Or we could be a throuple.<eos> I mean, that makes just about as much sense as you two boning.
Good job.<eos> Are you at least having Eve look into this?<eos> She couldn't find out anything.<eos> Can Nate?<eos> We're not gonna ask him to clean up our mess anymore.<eos> I'm on it, okay?<eos> Your job today is to study.<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you'd have run off to Mexico to be with Frank by now.<eos> You two get to spend the day babysitting each other.
Get out.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> I said, get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> I hope to God Connor's not here.<eos> I want to make noise.<eos> Hey. Wait.<eos> You two are friends again?
Pull it!<eos> - Please don't!<eos> Don't!<eos> - Do it for me!<eos> - Please don't!<eos> Welcome to your midterm exam.<eos> Before each of you is a case file for your client...<eos> Ted Bundy.<eos> It's 1989, and he's weeks away from the electric chair for the violent murder of 30 young women.<eos> You'll each get one minute to convince me, the Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court, to overturn his death sentence.
Baby, I messed up.<eos> I hate that I did it.<eos> But I'm your mama and I love you.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You don't know what love means?<eos> Coming from you?<eos> I have to study.<eos> You know, your friends aren't your family, Micky.<eos> They don't know you like we do.<eos> You have never known me.
Previously on "DARK MATTER"...<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.<eos> Why would you ever want to go back?<eos> I may not have a choice.<eos> I own a company called dwarf star technologies which owns Rebecca, who you know as portia.
So that's where I'm going.<eos> Hey, you're not going anywhere.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> You're weak, disoriented.<eos> At best, you're a non-factor. At worst, you jeopardize any shot we have at fixing this.<eos> You know, it's okay to let others take care of you once in a while.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> We're going to earth.<eos> "Raza," you seeing this?
Uh, we have them staying in separate hotels for now.<eos> But for your safety, the house security cams will remain on at all times.<eos> And in the meantime, no one leaves the house.<eos> As soon as this is resolved, we'll resume filming.<eos> We're only two episodes away from our finale, people.<eos> We've come this far together.<eos> How long do we just sit around for?<eos> Until our investigation is over.<eos> My squad and I will interview each and every one of you.<eos> And we expect you to cooperate fully.
They played us.<eos> We can order in, have it ready by the time we get to your place.<eos> Sounds romantic.<eos> Hey, Lu...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt, but you got to see this. Okay.<eos> The morning after the accusation,<eos> Lieutenant Olivia Benson and detectives from the Special Victims Unit arrived.<eos> My squad and I will interview each and every one of you.<eos> And we expect you to cooperate fully.
- He can't.<eos> - I'm right here, Mom.<eos> I know exactly where you are.<eos> Take the hint. So, what's up with you?<eos> Well, Lexie's out of town with her godmother.<eos> I always thought that was just a Cinderella thing, but apparently rich people have them, and they take them on safaris.<eos> Anyway, I'm totally free tomorrow.<eos> Do you want to come up for lunch?<eos> I would love to.<eos> Hey, I'm going to Sue's tomorrow, so you're on your own for lunch.
It's all good.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Looks like everybody's here and, uh, Sue's still breathing, so grab any seat you want and let's get our Stalin on.<eos> Uh-oh. Whoops. Sorry.<eos> I've said it before... nothing good ever happens when you leave the house.<eos> I can't believe they were talking about moving.<eos> Oh, Brick, I know it's sad.<eos> Well, it would have been sad.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They're not moving anymore 'cause you're giving them the money.
Why not?<eos> 'Cause we don't have any money. But you told Cindy's parents you were gonna think about it.<eos> Oh, that's just a thing people say.<eos> So you're not gonna think about it?<eos> Not even a little. Brick, everyone knows when people say,<eos> "I'll think about it," they're not gonna think about it.<eos> "I'll think about it," always means no.<eos> I can't believe you guys are doing this.<eos> Cindy's the love of my life.<eos> I may never see here again, and you don't even care.
I should've savored that Mexican crown.<eos> Might be the last thing I eat for a while.<eos> Hang on. Let's not panic.<eos> We just need to stay cool and make a plan.<eos> You're right. We can think our way out of this.<eos> I think I'll just stick with coffee.<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> I'd like a bowl of very hot water and six ketchup packets.<eos> Come on. You guys got to order something.<eos> Yeah, I can't enjoy my meal with you two shoving your (whispering): Poverty, in my face.
Bad enough I got the faceless tin can of death staring' over my shoulder.<eos> Can you not fly this craft any faster, Gamora?<eos> My vengeance will not wait.<eos> If you wanna take down Thanos, better get in line.<eos> Where is this line?<eos> I will fight my way to the front of it.<eos> Okay, I wired the communicator to the navigation system.<eos> Once His Majesty activates it, we'll have Thanos's location.<eos> Do it.<eos> Believe it or not, I want to find Peter as much as you do.
We have no shelter.<eos> If we don't get a fire lit soon, a severed toe is gonna feel like a massage.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're gonna die out here, anyway.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> I compared your blood to our one-armed friend, and... you have the same mutation.<eos> So I'm gonna end up like him.<eos> Probably.<eos> Blood rain vultures. Electric ants and Kovacs.<eos> You all have the same mutated markers in your genetic sequence.
Can you look straight ahead, please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Put your shirt on.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas, so anything's possible.<eos> Including a Triple-Helix.<eos> See that?<eos> That's what normal DNA looks like.<eos> That's yours.<eos> You and the vultures and the ants and Kovacs, you all have brand-new genes on a brand-new strand of DNA.
I don't see any money.<eos> I swear we tossed it when we started running.<eos> Just figured you guys would find it.<eos> Well, we didn't. And if we don't, I'm gonna throw you off a cliff.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> I watched him do it.<eos> It sounds like the clock's ticking.<eos> You got to believe us.<eos> Know what I think?<eos> You two been working together the whole time.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must stop these animals.<eos> We finally have the means to do so.<eos> Allow me to introduce TX-14.<eos> A two-part gas.<eos> A fast-acting elimination agent and a neutralizer.<eos> Which, when they combine, forms a compound that only targets the mutation.<eos> Human beings will be safe, but every animal with the mutation will be... destroyed.<eos> Tomorrow before the vote, we will give you a demonstration of the efficiency and the safety of this gas.<eos> But tonight enjoy yourselves.<eos> Get to know one another. For you will be sharing a page in the history books as the assembly that saved the world.
I love the motorcycle that we built, but this, this is less of a risk.<eos> There he is.<eos> I'm Cecil Mason. - This is my brother...<eos> - Mason Gears.<eos> These are your new friends?<eos> Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not if there's no conflict of interest.<eos> We didn't know you had a contract with Bill.<eos> We don't.<eos> Do you?
My contract is solely Indians.<eos> We put it all in.<eos> This... this'll... this'll ruin us.<eos> The house, the savings...<eos> If this don't work, we don't eat.<eos> W... w... why did you do this?<eos> Well, there... there were overages, bills to pay. I...<eos> I didn't think it'd go south.<eos> What were you thinking, huh?<eos> That... that you damn dumb idiots knew what you were doing!
- No, Big Bill.<eos> I waited too long, man.<eos> Harley-Davidson is not racing the motordrome.<eos> It wasn't personal, Eddie.<eos> You might be the best rider I know.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> There he is, that son of a bitch.<eos> He's risking everything we worked for.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's get down to the pits. I'll stay. You go.
And, what, you're here because you think that I...?<eos> A lot of the women were not happy about becoming your muses.<eos> No, but Phoebe wasn't like that. She was flattered.<eos> She reached out through my agent to say so. She even did some personal appearances here.<eos> You mind telling us where you were around 4:00 this morning?<eos> I was on a plane. Coming home from Paris.<eos> That's where I was when I learned about the burglary.<eos> Do you think there's a connection?<eos> The timing is curious, let's just leave it at that.<eos> No, you don't understand. If the same person committed both crimes, if someone had a problem with me and Phoebe, I think I might know who it is.
You steal cars, Keith.<eos> It's what landed you in prison.<eos> I used to steal cars.<eos> I hotwired them.<eos> Old sports cars.<eos> Vettes and Porsches parked on the streets of New York.<eos> But you're saying I stole a 2012 four-door from a valet lot in Connecticut?<eos> Any car will do when you're looking to commit a murder, right?<eos> And you're forgetting about the DNA.<eos> You planted it, obviously, because I didn't steal this car!
Her family is super religious.<eos> She never got around to telling them.<eos> The only people who knew were me and Phoebe and a couple of other friends.<eos> I'll give you their names.<eos> You can talk to them. They'll tell you.<eos> After she was killed, we decided it wasn't our place to say anything.<eos> Plus we knew it wasn't relevant because we knew Louis was the one who did it.<eos> Let's say we believe you.<eos> Is there any other "irrelevant" information you've been keeping to yourself?<eos> You say Louis is innocent, I say you're wrong, but Marissa was seeing somebody, a married woman.
Do we know if there was a connection between the victims?<eos> Not yet. Right now I couldn't tell you if one of them was the intended target and the other was a witness, or if they were both victims of a thrill-kill.<eos> Well, we know that Jared Talt was the one that the killer was interested in.<eos> He was the wealthier of the two.<eos> Uh, maybe we should start there, get some background.<eos> I contacted his wife, but she was up in Vermont visiting a sister.<eos> She's driving back this afternoon.<eos> There's also a business partner in Westchester.<eos> On Butch Callahan's side, there's only his girlfriend, Roxanne Ortiz.<eos> All right, you two take the girlfriend. Joan and I will take the business partner.
Meaning what?<eos> Well, I imagine the game was part of the original plan of Butch Callahan.<eos> Why his partner was being perforated several miles away, he's got club-level seats at the Garden.<eos> When he realized that Butch was planning to betray him, he hired a second hit man.<eos> A far more dependable one, obviously.<eos> Well, so much for catching him by surprise.<eos> I'll have Marcus comb through his phone records again.<eos> If he did hire a second gunman, maybe we'll find some trace of it.<eos> Keep us posted, will you?<eos> What, you're not coming back to the station?
I got an e-mail from Butch the-the day before it happened. It'll prove I'm telling the truth.<eos> "We can meet after it's done.<eos> "There's a bus stop at Van Dam and 37th.<eos> Bring the money. 2:00 a.m."<eos> It's from an account he created just so we could talk about this stuff.<eos> 89WildcatPF@odkermail.<eos> "PF" is power forward, his position in '89.<eos> On the Wildcats.<eos> Well, that proves that your friend is terrible at dreaming up digital aliases, but as far as exculpating you from the murders, it doesn't.<eos> You don't get it. I went to that meeting.
Because angels are monsters.<eos> We were then as we are now, fearsome engines of wrath.<eos> The most terrible things we did, we did on his command.<eos> The flood, sodom and gomorrah, the torments of job, Jonah, Daniel, St. Anthony, and all other holy fools, even the temptation of Christ himself...<eos> All on his orders.<eos> Write that down.<eos> That is your god.<eos> A vengeful, jealous, sadistic murderer, and hypocrite.<eos> And yet you plan a sacrifice every bit as cruel as the ones you charge him with.<eos> Doesn't that make you the hypocrite? No.
Write that down.<eos> That is your god.<eos> A vengeful, jealous, sadistic murderer, and hypocrite.<eos> And yet you plan a sacrifice every bit as cruel as the ones you charge him with.<eos> Doesn't that make you the hypocrite? No.<eos> I at least am honest.<eos> I do not ask those I torment to love and worship me.<eos> I am satisfied with mere obedience.<eos> Bitter, is what I would call you.<eos> You don't just plan a mass sacrifice. You wish to inaugurate an age of total war.

You wish to inaugurate an age of total war.<eos> You cannot compete with man for god's love, nor with god's for man, so you would see his most beloved creation destroy itself.<eos> You, sir, are the vengeful one. All you want is revenge on god.
I am disappointed in you, Isaac.<eos> I had such great hopes.<eos> But you disobeyed orders, run 'round chasing phantoms, and you've ignored your vital duties.<eos> On your watch, treasurer Putnam has most likely fallen victim to foul play.<eos> I'm afraid you're through. Turn over your nightstick.<eos> Disappointed in me?<eos> I haven't words to tell these people how disappointed I am in you.<eos> I thought you a man of the people.<eos> But he calls people like us animals.<eos> Fine then. We are all good, honest animals. But you, sir, are a snake.
This is CNO hailing you on Navy Red, over.<eos> I say again, Naval Station San Diego.<eos> This is CNO hailing you on Navy Red, over.<eos> Sir, there's something you need to see.<eos> Terror grips our nation this day.<eos> The strains of reconstruction have proven too great to bear and have given rise to forces hellbent on creating chaos.<eos> In front of live television cameras, agitators breached our walls and tried to take control of this nation's capital.<eos> This was not their first attempt.<eos> Until today, the regional leaders and I have guarded the truth for the safety of the public.<eos> Now it's time you, the American people, learn the facts.
She's putting all this on you. - Excuse me.<eos> My apologies.<eos> - Nobody'll buy it.<eos> The greater the lie, the more people will believe it.<eos> We are strong people, and we have survived worse than this.<eos> And those who still love life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have come together and formulated a plan to move forward.<eos> So in the absence of any working federal government, and deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, your regional leaders, Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft hereby call for the immediate suspension of the government of the United States.<eos> Each region will be able to govern itself and focus on reconstruction until such time as a central authority can be safely reestablished. Yeah.<eos> In other words, never.<eos> By the time you hear these words, control of the Armed Forces will have been split among the regional leaders, and I would like to assure you... that the military turnover has been peaceful, thanks to an unprecedented collaboration
Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - It was a pleasure.<eos> - Great working with you. Bye.<eos> Apparently death by hanging gives you a boner.<eos> Do you get a boner when you put on a tie?
Wait now, AV.<eos> That's her vengeance song.<eos> Last time I heard that, I woke up with my whole body shaved.<eos> - ♪ Yeah, study war no more ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm doing you a favor by cutting up your ugly-ass clothes.<eos> My Caché!<eos> That's Chico's, and you know it.<eos> Okay. I have had enough of you, Ruby!<eos> And I've had enough of you two cheating behind my back all these years.
Pops and auntie AV have been cheating behind grandma Ruby's back.<eos> That means she's not his sister.<eos> She's his... girlfriend.<eos> Our family is such a cliché.<eos> Sometimes I think of just driving east.<eos> You're saying that there's a chance that auntie AV's our real grandmother?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay, this is stupid.<eos> I'm going down there to figure out what really happened.<eos> You, fix my wall.
Is that right?<eos> My back!<eos> It's not my fault that Nixon extended disability to anybody who could read a poster. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Had me working long hours so I could put food on the table.<eos> Is that right?<eos> My wrist!<eos> My wrist!<eos> My other wrist!<eos> My ankle's starting to swell a little.<eos> The problem is, you two think that you white-collar people are better than us blue-collar people.
I don't think I'm better than anyone.<eos> Well, now, that's the first time I've agreed with you.<eos> - She's worse than everybody.<eos> - Okay.<eos> W-We've set those kids up to continue down the road that we pave.<eos> For them, blue collar is going backwards.<eos> And we're not crazy for wanting our son to go to college!<eos> And grad school!<eos> I went to grad school, okay?<eos> And you want him to do as well as his best parent. - I...
or, uh, uh, "All I Want for Christmas is You."<eos> You did not grow up on a Mariah Carey song<eos> - from 1994.<eos> - Shut up, boy. You don't know what the hell you talking about.<eos> That song came out in the '50s.<eos> He's right!<eos> Earl and I first made love to that song in 1971.<eos> Didn't we, baby? Remember?<eos> - Sure did.<eos> - Hey! You two are crazy.
Babies are stronger now.<eos> Like weed.<eos> I'm really sorry I was so judgy. Yeah.<eos> Here is the deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> From now on, we are gonna support each other.<eos> I like that.<eos> - Because we are amazing.<eos> - Mm! We should all support each other, but we can't.<eos> 'Cause you two are failures.
It's basically giving up.<eos> So you think your parents gave up when they had you?<eos> No, I think my parents gave up when they had Bobby.<eos> Then they gave up on Bobby and had me.<eos> So, what do we do? I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, but I am not gonna wait around and see if you're ready one day.<eos> Maxine, I really don't want to hurt you or anything, but it would be a lie if I sat here, and didn't tell you how I really felt.<eos> Perfect timing.<eos> We've already shared so many intimate moments today, why stop now?<eos> What are you two doing here?
The other day, you told me that nothing in the world, you would live your youth again.<eos> You remember?<eos> Perhaps things would have been less difficult for you, if a homosexual teacher you had said you were not alone in the world.<eos> Do not you realize what you're asking me?<eos> What are you scared?<eos> What do people know you're a lesbian?<eos> And that?<eos> Things have changed!<eos> I am dreaming!<eos> Do you think you're paranoid?
And, as I told you,<eos> Totally I'm against it!<eos> Not think it is personal conviction.<eos> You guys know that parents do not hesitate to come to that!<eos> Listen, if Nathan has been hit, it is also our fault for doing nothing.<eos> It should not happen again, under the pretext not to disturb some parents.<eos> We are ready to launch a petition.<eos> 53 teachers working at the school, 47 said they are in favor of the coming of an association, and they are ready to sign it.<eos> And certainly a lot of parents sign too.<eos> It's good, but you do not respond to parents.
In the military, you learn to hold your emotions in check-- you need to be on point-- but when the time is right, you need to acknowledge and process those feelings, or they will eat you alive.<eos> That's exactly what I've been trying to teach this team.<eos> You get any hits?<eos> No, G4 grid is clear, move on to G5.<eos> Happy, direct the radar at section G5.<eos> Stay in the area where the white pines stood, where that man saw my father.<eos> Please. G5 is part of the white pine area.<eos> - You have to let me do my job.<eos> - Listen, John, the storm's almost on us, and we're still coming up short.<eos> You can go, but I'm not leaving.
If you want to as much as I do.<eos> (Chatter in Czech)<eos> (Chatter and laughter)<eos> (Birdsong)<eos> - I'm next door if you need anything. Thanks for your help, Dr Campbell.<eos> We really appreciate it.<eos> Now if theres anything he or you need, just call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (Door closes)<eos> Everything you need is within arm's reach. What's that'?
And he's not my friend.<eos> Didn't you get acquainted while you were dancing'?<eos> (Further explosions)<eos> Bloody hell, that was close.<eos> Why would they be bombing us when the target is Liverpool'?<eos> It's not just Liverpool. It's the canals transporting armaments. It's anywhere else they want to target to destroy our morale.<eos> Or just pilots dumping bombs early to get back to Germany before they're shot down.<eos> That's not right.<eos> (Coughs) It's war. What has right got to do with anything?<eos> You all need to get your heads out of your backsides and understand what'll happen when the Nazis come.
Hey, man.<eos> First day, huh?<eos> - School is school.<eos> - Sure, except, in this school, people get killed by knife-wielding maniacs every 20 years, give or take.<eos> Excuse me! "Girl's only" moment.<eos> So, out of nowhere, Branson hits me up this morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He said he just "heard" Jake and I broke up.<eos> Whoa! How did he hear that?<eos> Barely anyone even knew that you were together.
What the hell are you trying to pull?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are your ships attacking us?<eos> We're attacking you because we're at war.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You've decimated a dozen of our outposts... destroyed three of our ships... and now you claim you don't know what's going on.<eos> The fact that you're even talking to me suggests... there's something wrong with your blink drive... otherwise you'd be long gone by now.<eos> How does she know about the drive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Either you surrender and let us board... or we blast you to bits... and pick through your scattered remnants.
Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I-I didn't wanna be alone.<eos> That's why I brought T.C. food.<eos> That's why I helped Topher with that OD.<eos> Yeah, I get it. Anything to avoid the middle of the night struggle.<eos> Staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to come up.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> I know you two aren't close.
We need another way in.<eos> We can go through the mouth.<eos> We can bypass the debris and cut the OR time in half.<eos> Through the mouth?<eos> Have you done that before?<eos> I assisted in the exact same procedure on a corporal in Bagram. He had a piece of shrapnel lodged on his second vertebrae.<eos> - And it worked?<eos> - Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. It's pretty tricky.<eos> But if we don't, this girl will never walk again.<eos> Well, you Army docs do stuff on the battlefield every day that we've never tried around here.
I got to get home and game this out.<eos> Home?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I can take Lena with.<eos> No.<eos> I will get Krystal to take her.<eos> Not Krystal, no.<eos> Smurf will be fine.<eos> She can just, you know...<eos> What, put her in the corner eating candy while you figure out what to do about the cop you killed?
No one saw us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kilmer's got it in 50 pieces by now.<eos> We... we... we couldn't get to Kilmer's.<eos> W-we... we had to drop it in the salvage yard, the one we used for the bank.<eos> So, the car with Craig's blood and a dead cop's bullets in it is sitting in San Pedro waiting to be found?<eos> I was worried Craig was gonna bleed out.<eos> I had to make the call.<eos> I made the call.<eos> You two are going back to that car.
I was worried Craig was gonna bleed out.<eos> I had to make the call.<eos> I made the call.<eos> You two are going back to that car.<eos> You're gonna strip it, bleach it, chop it in 10 pieces, and then throw it into the goddamn ocean.<eos> No.<eos> No, why... why us?<eos> It was Baz's call.<eos> Baz made the call.<eos> He wouldn't have had to if you hadn't screwed up in the first place.
The fact he hasn't made contact suggests he is, even if he doesn't realize it.<eos> Who's the woman?<eos> No ID on his companion, but facial rec is currently running.<eos> How many AKs were stolen?<eos> 100 AKs and over 2,000 rounds of Rhino ammo tagged for disposal.<eos> That's enough to arm a small militia or tip the balance in a gang war.<eos> We can't let those weapons hit the street.<eos> Where are the drivers?<eos> Marine Sergeants Edward Jones and Kevin Brickson are being treated at St. Anne's Hospital.<eos> You take the hospital.
He's breathing.<eos> Nate, can you hear me?<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Come out now!<eos> Put your hands up!<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> Now.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> You forgot to say "federal agents," so I'm going to need you two to drop your weapons.
You don't just put a bullet in a guy like this.<eos> His friends will find him and then they'll find us.<eos> A guy like this has to disappear.<eos> And that means disposal.<eos> Piece by piece, if necessary, and that takes time.<eos> The kind of time that makes us miss the exchange.<eos> He comes with us.<eos> You're going to be good at this.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> You two keep an eye on our friend.
♪ He stayed on as a senator ♪ ♪ Got reelected twice ♪<eos> ♪ Easily distracted, not intelligent as such ♪<eos> ♪ Turns out having half a brain ♪ ♪ Just doesn't matter all that much ♪<eos> Well, I'm not a scientist.<eos> - Am I? - No, sir.<eos> So, I-I can't tell you 100% whether global warming is real, but, uh, doggy-woggy.<eos> There is doggy-woggy.<eos> Wh-why can't I have a doggy-woggy?<eos> What I mean is, uh, there are those who, uh, believe that, uh, global warming is a conspiracy put forward by the Chinese.<eos> You tell me.
My apologies.<eos> Sergeant Thatcher, your efforts are invaluable and we are grateful for them.<eos> Oh, eternally so.<eos> Best make my way.<eos> Do you imagine making the boy feel an ass will inspire loyalty and diligence?<eos> Perhaps you should leave managing policemen to me.<eos> If we have need of an informant in a brothel, I have no doubt your expertise will prove invaluable.<eos> You may not think me ally, but we are nonetheless, for now, cellmates.<eos> - Miss Hart, do you not understand why?<eos> - Oh, I understand more than you can know, Mr Reid.
You're the man of the house now, Caleb, and of the business.<eos> I'll need help, Prue.<eos> Course.<eos> Family pulls together, does it not, Robin?<eos> You'll help your uncle, won't you?<eos> - Pour the gin, boy.<eos> - Yes, Uncle.<eos> Good lad.<eos> Father used to go upriver for his eels.<eos> Then you appeared overnight, like a toadstool.
Then let us say a prayer for both our fathers.<eos> May they rest at peace.<eos> Now, eat up, all of you.<eos> Miss Sumner.<eos> 'Scuse me lateness, Nathaniel.<eos> Me brother, Caleb, is not well this morning.<eos> Mama, did you ask him?<eos> Robin, please.<eos> Nathaniel, without Caleb, I... Robin and I shall struggle to manage the store by ourselves.<eos> If there was any way you could... uh, I mean to say, there'd be coin in it, of course.
You will perhaps understand the necessity of my questioning and my satisfaction at your answer, when I explain the purpose of my visit.<eos> Mr Drummond, I wish to offer you a promotion.<eos> Oh, Mr Dove, I... I don't know...<eos> I mean, to say thank you.<eos> No gratitude required.<eos> It would be dereliction of my duty to permit abilities such as yours to go undernourished and unrewarded, Inspector Drummond.<eos> Miss Reid, a toast.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I see great things ahead for you, Samuel Drummond.<eos> Mr Shine may the present of Leman Street, but you are its future.
And better than that, where Nathaniel is holed up.<eos> Reid, Reid, it is broad day light.<eos> - We'll move fast.<eos> - We can't<eos> Have we not waited here long enough for the merest thread to follow.<eos> We know where he lives.<eos> We find him.<eos> We get to Dove.<eos> We find the bodies we go to Dove.<eos> You wait here to keep the boy safe.
Sir, is that blood?<eos> Let me tell you what I see... a looking glass that every day reflects the continued inefficacy of this division to prosecute justice upon its most hunted fugitives.<eos> Now, there are some might say this is shame on us should be doubled, at least.<eos> Even our most recently promoted officer is sweetheart to the very daughter of the fugitive we chase.<eos> - Sir.<eos> Now, she...<eos> I will tell you what she is, your Mathilda Reid.<eos> She's on the side of goodness, willing to turn against her own Pappy out of noble rectitude.<eos> And you?<eos> You, Drummond, lack even the decency to share such with your constabulary brothers.
There... there is a candle, sir, in the bedroom window.<eos> Miss Reid, might I have a word?<eos> Mr. Shine, I really must be going.<eos> A moment is all.<eos> And no more.<eos> Last we spoke, I pondered we were kin on account of us both resurrected.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Please, Miss Reid.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> You are life, but I?
I told Caitlin to get some sleep.<eos> 'Cause we're getting out with Connor.<eos> I know you want Dove.<eos> I know you want justice for Drake, for Bloom, for... for all of 'em.<eos> But I can't help you no more.<eos> I buried him.<eos> You were right.<eos> it is over.<eos> I want to give you some advice.<eos> You get out also.
If detonated, they could shut down an area for months, if not years, for adequate decontamination and cleanup.<eos> Well, not to mention trying to convince people that it's safe afterwards.<eos> Unfortunately, because of its water-soluble nature, it could be used to contaminate city water supplies.<eos> Oh, one more fun fact.<eos> Cyprus is not its final destination.<eos> From there, it was scheduled to be boarded onto a ship bound for the Port of Latakia, Syria.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll take the hospital angle.<eos> You two find out who paid for that container, what else was inside it.
Now, Toby, I left my car in Tahoe and Paige's is at her house, so we'll need to borrow yours.<eos> Okay, but I just had it washed in '08, so be careful with it.<eos> Really?<eos> So... you and Paige?<eos> Why not Sylvester and Paige?<eos> No, Sly will be with you and Cabe on the way to Bulgaria to find the hackers.<eos> Oh, so you stay with Paige and you ship me off to Bulgaria?<eos> Tim...<eos> Easy, buddy.<eos> Sly can handle whatever the hackers throw at him tech-wise, and you two are necessary law enforcement in a foreign country.
Online bank thieves.<eos> Yeah, we farmed out a job to a group in Sofia, hackers, gave them all the Intel on the bank, paid them their fee, they stole the cash, never turned over a dime.<eos> Too bad for you.<eos> We figure anybody working this area pays you regular tribute.<eos> So, for their address, we'll give you the money we earned, our ten-grand buy-in and a finder's fee if the Intel nabs the punks.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Which are missing?<eos> Ace of diamonds, two of spades, king of clubs.<eos> Only people who can pull off what you say are called "The Bootleggers."<eos> I give you information, you give me him.
His neck's a little rusty, but that's a no.<eos> I would make us a drink but without a liquor license, all I can make is meth.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> No, I was in a funk about Randy and you had to do all this stuff on your own.<eos> - It's my fault.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> That's what I really thought, but I just wanted to make sure it was out there.<eos> We have zero luck, Max, zero.<eos> I just stopped by to say I'm sorry about your dessert bar.<eos> You two are unlucky A, F.
Speech!<eos> No ,fuckoff .<eos> You can say something.<eos> Well, fine, I'll say something, shall I?<eos> Um,thelasttime that Dee allowed us to throw her a party was her 13th and she was petrified that no-one would come.<eos> Well, people did come, and some of you are here tonight. And it very soon turned into a rather raucous party, fora 13thbirthdayparty, and I can't even begin to tell you what happened to my prize geraniums!<eos> Oh, those bastards deserved it.<eos> Flowers of the devil!<eos> Well, the people who came to that party are as nothing compared with you being here tonight.<eos> I know what they're saying about me has probably made it hard for you to come through our door, and I'm very grateful that you did.
Iwilldo better.<eos> Mr Finchley, you are a serial rapist, an opportunist.<eos> Youhavedone damage to those you've worked with, your close family and women you barely know.<eos> All because you couldn't control your anger towards women.<eos> Iamnotperfect... ..butI didnotdothis .<eos> GIRL WHISPERS: One. Two.<eos> Four.<eos> Five.<eos> Ta, pal.<eos> You, the jury, have to decide whether you are sure that the complainants are telling the truth.
- Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Get back!<eos> No!<eos> Don't take another step!<eos> Everybody, put your hands behind your back!<eos> Get down on your knees now!<eos> Oh, no, no, no!<eos> Shoot me in the heart.<eos> Or wait... maybe you want me to turn around so you can do it in my back, huh?
- Gideon.<eos> - I'm here, Captain.<eos> Where's Captain Hunter?<eos> I would be happy to play his final message for you all.<eos> Together, you are the best crew, the best team a captain could ever hope for.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What do you guys say we get out of 1942?<eos> Not until you answer a few questions.<eos> We're the Justice Society of America.<eos> And you're coming with us.
Protect Max Lorenz!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> We came back to... to rescue you.<eos> If we're meant to be impressed by all this technology, it has the opposite effect.<eos> It only makes you that much more dangerous.<eos> Well, and there's evidence to support that, but I think what's important now is for all us to stop arguing.<eos> Does your team ever stop arguing?<eos> Fair point.<eos> I think what Martin is trying to say is we're gonna help you whether you like it or not.<eos> You're going after Krieger. We know where he's going next.
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say we're on the island of...<eos> Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you learn to speak my language?<eos> I studied it for many years.<eos> You know, so I could trade with your countrymen.<eos> Yep, feudal Japan is my jam.<eos> Masako, what are you doing talking to this gaijin?<eos> He was hurt, Father.<eos> I brought him home so you could care for him.
And we will.<eos> After. Please, don't tell me you're not intrigued.<eos> Masako san, a word please.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The Shogun's men are here. Please come outside.<eos> Konnichiwa.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> We found a gaijin in the forest.<eos> The Shogun wants to make sure there are not any other foreigners around - to bother you.<eos> - Oh, that is very kind of him, but you are the only visitor we've had today.
Thank you.<eos> We've spread the vaccine our friends worked up.<eos> The only Confederates you'll have to worry about now are the living ones.<eos> I'm obliged.<eos> Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh... tells me you're his captain.<eos> In any case, he mentioned something about you having regrets about putting men in harm's way.<eos> I don't think that's something I can ever get used to.<eos> You know, by the time I had taken over this division, there had already been three other generals in place before me. They'd all stepped down and given up. But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you?
- Thank you, Mister...<eos> - Hex.<eos> Jonah Hex.<eos> Temporal Aberrations cause these things called timequakes.<eos> If there was a way of locating their epicenters, maybe we'll be able to fix the Aberrations before they happen.<eos> Whoa, there, wanderer.<eos> Don't see many folks around here.<eos> Been a while since this old mine turned up anything worth taking.<eos> Then I guess I'll be on my way.<eos> And let you be on yours.
How'd you know I needed saving?<eos> Because we got an alert that history was being changed, and the coordinates led us to your hanging.<eos> Well, I guess it's nice to know that I matter.<eos> Leaving already?<eos> I didn't get to shoot anyone.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Where's Rip?<eos> He's MIA.<eos> Damn.<eos> How the hell did you miscreants manage to not get yourselves killed without him?
There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I think.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> - I think I liked him.<eos> That's three of them for every one of us.<eos> Hex and I will draw their attention while you two go make sure Turnbull can't pull anymore dwarf star out of the ground.
- Have you seen "Stranger Things"?<eos> - Maybe too much TV, Cisco.<eos> Life imitates art, Felicity.<eos> Either way, whether you like it or not, we're gonna have to be the ones to rescue them.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No.<eos> This is tech support.<eos> Set your phasers to "stun."<eos> This is why I hate the government.<eos> Can't you two use your powers and get us out of here?
He didn't even say thank you. What is that?<eos> I think it's a transponder.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> I may or may not have stolen it.<eos> From his ship.<eos> What does it do?<eos> I think we can use it to communicate with him when we get back.<eos> Oh, my God, like an alien pen pal.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You kids finished?
Nope.<eos> It sure beats screwing up the world.<eos> Hey, you are too hard on yourself.<eos> That's what people usually tell me.<eos> And for good reason, I'm sure.<eos> But, back on my Earth, it's just me and my cousin.<eos> Between the two of us, we're more powerful than...<eos> Yeah, everybody in this room combined.<eos> No, no. That's the point.<eos> That's what you've all proven here.
I got a better idea.<eos> How 'bout I show you how business is done in my town?<eos> You or me?<eos> Oh, I've got... this.<eos> By now you've probably surmised that my friend and I aren't from around here.<eos> - What do you freaks want? - To help.<eos> I thought I made...<eos> did I not make that perfectly clear?<eos> New enemies are coming to Chicago, and they will endanger your enterprises.<eos> And you're saying you two can help me out?
This week, Ness and his team are supposed to obtain Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.<eos> Now the IRS's case against Capone for tax evasion is completely dependent on that ledger.<eos> Which Ness can't grab while he's lying here with brain damage.<eos> Exactly, which means one of us has to take his place.<eos> - That's a stupid idea. - It's pre-Internet.<eos> Nobody knows what Ness looks like.<eos> Nate's right, I got this.<eos> Actually, I was thinking I got this.<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission was impersonating Brad Pitt, you'd be the man, but I think we can all agree if anyone here looks like a G-man here, it's me.<eos> Well, we're in this situation, because you learned history - from a movie.
Fine.<eos> I'll go the club with Jax and Stein, and you can stay here, drink your beers, and watch over Ness.<eos> What about me?<eos> - You can watch over him.<eos> - What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Beer.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Special agent Cole Bennett.<eos> - Yes, and you are?
It appears our speedster friend got the better of us.<eos> - And he wasn't working alone.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Damien Darhk, a rather predictable bedfellow for Al Capone.<eos> And don't forget about me.<eos> It's been a long time, Sara.<eos> You look good for someone who's come back from the dead.<eos> Why am I not surprised that you and Damien Darhk would find each other?<eos> What do you want with us?<eos> You have something we need, and while my partners think I'm a fool for trying, I would like to broker a deal with you.
Okay, you know what?<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you guys were supposed to talk about us.<eos> We did.<eos> Then why are you being so weird?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Dad?<eos> Iris.<eos> I already told him, if you two want to cuddle, make out, do whatever,
I said get here quick, but that was... quicker than I expected.<eos> Oh, no, yeah, it was a... crazy Uber driver.<eos> Well, the blast pattern and the scoring on the insulation suggests that it was a power surge that blew it out.<eos> So it's a coincidence?<eos> I highly doubt it.<eos> But I'll figure it out.<eos> Someone in this city has to do something about these metas.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We have a whole police force working to stop these metas.<eos> No, you have The Flash.
I made a pact to justify my presence on your Earth and I think I got something.<eos> - We're all ears. - Okay.<eos> I read every news report I can get my hands on.<eos> And I have come to the conclusion that this very operation is a ticking time-bomb. What do you mean?<eos> You can't spend all your time working on... working on whatever... whatever this is.<eos> This... this is a very delicate set of power-dampening cuffs.<eos> We need them to stop the meta-humans.<eos> My point exactly.<eos> It's not gonna be long before people start putting the pieces together and figure out what you're doing here.<eos> You're working with The Flash.
Particle... vision?<eos> Particle vision, which is a moment-to-moment reenactment of the particle accelerator explosion, but seen from the point of view of...<eos> - Part...<eos> - The particle!<eos> Listen, H.R., I know that you're trying to figure out how you add value to the team, I get it, but this...<eos> Let me stop you right there, B.A.<eos> - Okay, don't call me B.A...<eos> - I can make S.T.A.R. Labs the powerhouse in the scientific community that it once was, and, moreover, earn back the people's trust.<eos> Look at you guys.<eos> You just... your faces are so darn gloomy.
Yeah.<eos> Thank you all for coming. Rene:<eos> I only came because Blondie said there'd be an apology.<eos> Well, Blondie made a good point.<eos> You're not just joining up with the Green Arrow.<eos> You'd be joining up with me.<eos> The Green Arrow is the mayor?<eos> Curtis: I had the same cognitive dissonance.<eos> I hope you don't think I'm going to apologize for the trash I talked about you.<eos> No more than I'm going to apologize for the tough training, but I understand that you all need to trust me.
They've hit up 7 banks in 3 states over the past two weeks.<eos> Who's running point?<eos> Eric Dunn.<eos> It's not the first time he's tried these scare tactics.<eos> SCPD collared him in 2011 for multiple armed robberies.<eos> He should be in Iron Heights for another 8 years, trading cigarettes.<eos> - So how'd he get out?<eos> - Parole. Our justice system at work.<eos> Dunn must have formed a new crew.<eos> So Dunn and this new crew hit the bank, but vigilante got there before you did.
You have no idea, and, Susan... call me Oliver.<eos> Hey. We can't find Vigilante, but I think we figured out a way to draw him out.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> How do you feel about us robbing a bank?<eos> God, it's hot in that mask!<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> - Security cameras.<eos> - I'm on it. Maybe I wasn't paying attention during the briefing, but isn't the point to get caught?<eos> Yeah, not by the cops.<eos> That's why I'm only cutting lines to SCPD. You two take the safe upstairs.
Why would Quentin believe that?<eos> Because he's been blacking out.<eos> Look. He's--he's in rehab.<eos> He's just taking some time.<eos> I--I've been wondering why--why would somebody be targeting him, and... the only thing I can think of--<eos> What if Prometheus knows I'm the Green Arrow?<eos> I've killed men for less than this.<eos> So try, or are you gonna turn down a challenge in front of your men?<eos> Maybe that means you're too weak to know the difference. Ha!<eos> You will not interfere.
You want me to pimp myself out?<eos> No.<eos> Metaphorically.<eos> Hey, he used you.<eos> He distracted you while Red stole Senator Spitz from us, so use him back.<eos> Look... I need this.<eos> I'm in danger of losing my job.<eos> - ...we are getting flooded...<eos> - The deficit has gone down.<eos> Why won't you...?
I'll send you copies.<eos> What's the offer, Red?<eos> Well... we want the shutdown to end.<eos> There's... there's too much pain.<eos> Agreed.<eos> What's the offer?<eos> Commerce, education and energy.<eos> What about them?<eos> Well, they're wasteful, bloated bureaucracies that hamper the free market.<eos> We'll agree to a budget deal if you agree to cut them.
Okay, look, I, uh...<eos> I love how politically correct we're pretending to be.<eos> We're in a safe place; no one's listening.<eos> We can express how we really feel.<eos> Maxine is listening.<eos> Well, the truth is, you know, we saw Muslims, and we don't know how to react 'cause we don't see Muslims a lot.<eos> You know, only on TV, and they're usually playing the bad guy, but no one has to feel bad for expressing how they really feel.<eos> You know, Jerrod is right.<eos> What are they doing in my America? !<eos> So you guys can't actually be concerned that your new neighbors are Muslim, 'cause that would imply that you think that they could be...
So your gift basket has an ulterior motive?<eos> So?<eos> You know why Jesus was so nice to everyone?<eos> Because he knew people were trying to kill him. Mm-hmm.<eos> And all of that still didn't help Jesus.<eos> Makes you wonder, maybe he could've been nicer.<eos> Jerrod, remember when you were in middle school, I told you and your brother to always be nice to the white kids in trench coats.<eos> Kept you safe, didn't it?<eos> 'Cause they didn't do anything.<eos> That's because you were nice to them.
I've got the REACT Tactical Team at Santa Monica Airport, waiting to escort Granger and Jennifer Kim to a safe house.<eos> Well, there's no telling how much information that Choi's gonna have on Jennifer's whereabouts, so we'll meet the REACT team, we'll be there when Granger lands.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Hetty.<eos> The assistant director's plane just changed direction.<eos> It was making its approach to Santa Monica Airport, and then it diverted.<eos> And where's it heading?<eos> Burbank Airport.<eos> It's landing right now. All right, we won't involve the local PD.<eos> I'll get the REACT Team moving, and you need to go.
So, do we have any reason to believe that this isn't just a tragic accident?<eos> Well, not yet, but because of the sensitive nature of the information stored there, we have to take every precaution.<eos> Which is why we tasked an agent to clear the scene of any personnel without clearance.<eos> That included fire, EMS, medical examiners.<eos> Would this agent go by the name of "Nellosaurus," wearing a one-piece jumpsuit?<eos> No one's getting past my girl.<eos> Except for Callen and Sam.<eos> Except for Callen and Sam.<eos> Who are on their way to determine if anything was taken from the SCIF.<eos> So, you two head to the boatshed, talk to Commander Susan Yelton of DoD.
You, too.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> LAFD!<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Hey!<eos> You didn't turn your bottle on.<eos> You'll be eating smoke in there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Primary search.<eos> You two go left, me and the rookie go right.
Then there was her unexpected trip to Florida.<eos> Mind if I take a look in the house?<eos> Look at whatever you need to.<eos> Just want to know what happened to my girl.<eos> Tell me things.<eos> Just heard from the hospital.<eos> General Matthews is gonna pull through.<eos> Nilsen's over there now getting updated.<eos> That's good news.<eos> What are you two doing?
No need walking us out.<eos> You want to tell me what this is about?<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Just not right now.<eos> Agents Butler and Lake will take you back to the Stanbridge.<eos> I'll meet you at the hotel.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> How do you know where I'm staying?<eos> Same way I knew you'd be here.<eos> Believe me, DHS is just as interested in what happened to General Matthews as you are.
She was afraid of someone.<eos> And I swear it was not me.<eos> So, Agent Russo, we have never met before.<eos> You want to explain why you told the FBI we're working together?<eos> General Matthews.<eos> That's why you're here, right?<eos> Someone leaked your case files to the news.<eos> Ruined his career.<eos> And his appointment to be my boss at Homeland Security.<eos> You're investigating the leak too. You got to try some of this.
Red grid, Sebastian.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yeah, uh, sorry.<eos> The, uh, the red grids are the areas of the highest probability of finding the dive boat.<eos> If it's still upright, that is.<eos> Uh, there was some pretty big swells last night.<eos> Did we know that Russo was coming?<eos> Thanks, Sebastian.<eos> Brody and I will coordinate with Coast Guard, try and track down the boat.<eos> You two get with Greene's CO and learn things.
The inside's covered with this stuff.<eos> So they were smuggling in explosives.<eos> If so, a sub that size could have had hundreds of pounds on it, maybe more.<eos> Question is, who's got it now?<eos> Whoever the agents were working for.<eos> Only explanation.<eos> Problem is I can't come up with a name because I can't decrypt the agents' cell or his computer.<eos> I thought you could decrypt anything<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Believe me, I'm just as surprised as you are.
Yeah.<eos> New Fiona.<eos> Oh, no, I don't do three-ways.<eos> Jesus, New Monica.<eos> She's my new daughter, not a three-way.<eos> I'm...<eos> Although we should discuss the three-way thing, because you're really missing out.<eos> But no, that's not what this is about.<eos> What is it?<eos> You need new parents.
His operation is decimated.<eos> Did they find Figgis?<eos> Not yet, but they're confident they will.<eos> And when they do, Detective Pimento can come home.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> I'm gonna eat his face off.<eos> You guys are so cute.<eos> I'd like to propose a toast.<eos> Even when Bob held that gun to my head,<eos> I was not afraid, because I knew you were on the case.
See how that works?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, chef.<eos> Cheapskate.<eos> Good morning, Ona.<eos> Good morning, Commander.<eos> You look beautiful this morning.<eos> You've been saying the same line to me for six years.<eos> And I meant it every time.<eos> I thought you Navy boys were all action.
Baby, please...<eos> Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> You think I'd do this if I had another option?<eos> I don't have another option.<eos> I'm gonna end this thing.<eos> I'm gonna end this thing now, you understand?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, um, guys...<eos> Yeah, this is good.<eos> Okay, listen, I'm gonna need you to stay here with your mother, understand?
That's-that's impressive.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> One more year, and she'll be Counselor Ortega.<eos> How long you, uh, you gonna be in town?<eos> Oh, just a few days.<eos> I had some time over spring break and thought I'd come home and see my big bro.<eos> I'm sorry, can we hold on a second, back it up a few beats?<eos> I need a little clarity on something.<eos> Um, you two are related?
Besides, my customers pay top dollar to stay anon.<eos> Except they're not so anonymous to you.<eos> We both know that you keep records of all your buyers, so that way, if the heat does come down, you've got someone to roll on.<eos> Let me be clear, okay?<eos> It's not that I can't help you, it's that I don't want to.<eos> And I think you know why.<eos> This is going great.<eos> About as well as I expected.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Okay, it's obvious you two have some history, but can we just take a step back and focus on my problem?
At the moment, Brigante's in the wind, but we are gonna catch up with him, and when we do, he's gonna roll on you.<eos> Look, here's the thing. You-you got kids, right?<eos> You got-- your daughters are, what, eight and ten years old?<eos> The way things look right now, you're probably gonna go away and not get out until the young one's about 30 years old, right?<eos> But if you help us, maybe we can guarantee that you get to see, uh, the young one's high school graduation.<eos> Look, all we want to know is what Brigante was able to learn about Gabriel's whereabouts.<eos> That's it.<eos> Gentlemen, if I knew where to find Gabriel Waincroft, I would tell you.<eos> The man killed my father.<eos> I want to see him punished as much as you do.
Vanessa Diaz?<eos> I don't know anyone by that name.<eos> Vanessa Diaz's full name is Vanessa Diaz Waincroft.<eos> She was Gabriel's wife.<eos> She was shot in their home last night, and Jimmy Brigante pulled the trigger.<eos> Now, you already know all this, because you're the one who sent him over there to get information.<eos> If I knew where to find Gabriel Waincroft<eos> I would tell you.<eos> The man killed my father.<eos> I want to see him punished as much as you do.
Johnny, we have to go now!<eos> They're Sixes.<eos> - D'av!<eos> - Sorry, buddy.<eos> He even handed over the knife like you said he would.<eos> Old habits die hard in Old Town.<eos> Give me the other one.<eos> How could... How could you?<eos> Your own people...<eos> You're not my people.
Gracias.<eos> ♪<eos> Commander, it's just a concert.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> You're too young.<eos> This is so unfair; all my friends get to go.<eos> Look, when you turn 18, you're free to see as many boy bands as you want.<eos> Dad, "The 1975" is not a boy band.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Could you two be any more uncool?
Ha! I won again.<eos> Hey, Gibbs, perfect timing.<eos> Would you loan me $20?<eos> Quinn has just cleaned me out.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Poker was not my choice.<eos> He talked me into it.<eos> Well, I thought you'd take it easy on me, considering my weakened condition. Mm-mm.<eos> First Gibbs gets shot, then you got shot.<eos> I'm thinking you two are trying to one-up each other on bullet wounds.
We're good!<eos> You can turn the power off now!<eos> Thanks!<eos> Gunny said you wanted to see us?<eos> Come on in, sit down.<eos> How's it working out between you two?<eos> Uh, all good. What about you, Jimmy?<eos> How you liking being a paramedic?<eos> - Love it.<eos> - Good. Apparently, you two have made some fans out there.
Look. I will get your percentages back up.<eos> I got great vendors to bring to the table.<eos> This could really work out.<eos> Or you could pay me $300.<eos> Herrmann.<eos> You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> You get an employee and $300. I mean, she's basically paying you for the job.<eos> Talk about a win-win, right?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Tell me you two weren't in cahoots on this.
Call me Matt.<eos> He's not listening to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> - I don't need a babysitter. - Yeah, I know you don't.<eos> But I'm walking with you.<eos> I'll get my cap and gown.<eos> Ready when you are, Lieutenant.
Wait out here.<eos> It's okay, it's clean.<eos> We each have a wound, a humiliation, a death to mourn.<eos> The hand that's hurt us all is the same.<eos> It's Savastano's.<eos> Some of you lost a brother, or a father, because of Gennaro and his guys.<eos> But that's history.<eos> The ones who treated us like slaves are now hiding in some fucking hole or hooked to a machine to stay alive.<eos> Me and Salvatore Conte made a promise and we're keeping it.<eos> You are all the ones who count most at the dealing spots.
- Why not?<eos> Because I should, um, focus on work.<eos> Am I too distracting for you?<eos> I promise not to bother...<eos> Please, just...<eos> What?<eos> - Cal.<eos> - No.<eos> Why was he coming in your bedroom in the middle of the night?<eos> Did you two have a thing or...
The Ladder. He was determined to climb it.<eos> There are pages and pages of crazy writings.<eos> "I tried to climb the ladder, but every time I tried, "I kept burning my hands.<eos> "My hands are bloody and raw.<eos> Next time..." That was his last journal entry.<eos> "Next time I will climb The Ladder, even if it kills me."<eos> I wanted to die, too, when I read it.<eos> But I couldn't go through with it.<eos> I've lost everything.<eos> I know you don't take people back.
My family's coming for dinner, Eddie.<eos> Why don't you just give me what you have for Summer, and I'll give it to her.<eos> I want to give it to her.<eos> It'll only upset her to see you right now.<eos> She's my fucking kid, Sarah.<eos> Just go home and get some sleep.<eos> You see, that's the problem here.<eos> I don't have a fucking home anymore, okay?<eos> This was my home.<eos> You were my home.
- Wellesley.<eos> This is Gravey, because he looks a bit grave.<eos> - Mine's called...<eos> - Waiting Boy.<eos> Is it?<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's a queer-looking little thing, Anne, much like yourself.<eos> - Look who's talking.<eos> - This is Sneaky.<eos> Thou art under my protection. I will watch over thy life. Pray tell you all, one day you shall be kings.
- Sharpers? - Thieves!<eos> So, what, they attacked you?<eos> You were robbed? - Four of them?<eos> - I think four.<eos> In broad daylight?<eos> That's...<eos> Well, surely someone saw what happened.<eos> What, you didn't even get there?<eos> No, it was just after I arrived at the coaching inn at St Martin le Grand, and I knew my way around from the maps in my head, but London, the whole thing is so much bigger than I imagined.<eos> And you didn't tell me how big it was, did you?
I've got him, Mr Riley!<eos> Emily, get him off me! I can't breathe.<eos> - Stop wriggling.<eos> Stop struggling.<eos> - Get him off me!<eos> I haven't done anything wrong!<eos> You've got the wrong man. Get off me!<eos> What were you legging it for, then, you little twat?<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> - Are you Patrick Bronte?
- Stop wriggling.<eos> Stop struggling.<eos> - Get him off me!<eos> I haven't done anything wrong!<eos> You've got the wrong man.

It's alright.<eos> Gentlemen, I have received your communication of the fifth instant for which I thank you.<eos> Your objection to the want of varied interest in "The Professor"is,<eos> I am aware, not without grounds.<eos> I have a second narrative in three volumes now completed to which I have endeavoured to impart a more vivid interest than belongs to "The Professor".<eos> I send you per rail a manuscript entitled "Jane Eyre", a novel in three volumes by Currer Bell.<eos> I keep telling you, you keep being told, one day one of us is not gonna leave that room alive.<eos> I will either kill you or I will kill myself.<eos> Do you want me to kill myself, eh?<eos> Cos if I do, old man, you can rest assured that you'll have driven me to it with your endless prayers and your drivel.
C Bronte, that's me, and this is Acton Bell, author of Agnes Grey and, the point is, author of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, not me.<eos> And Ellis couldn't come. Ellis didn't want to come. Ellis is...<eos> Anyway, the point is...<eos> we are three sisters.<eos> I have not sold the first few pages of my next novel to an America publisher, as claimed by Mr Thomas Cautley Newby.<eos> That is not my novel. It's Acton's.<eos> I, Mr Smith, have nothing, exactly nothing, to do with Mr Newby, and nor will my sister now she has seen him in his true colours.<eos> We are people of...<eos> of integrity and probity and that is why we are here, to set matters straight.<eos> Sorry, you're?

I-I-I tried calling him, but the phones are out.<eos> Have Dave and Gabriel had any problems in the past?<eos> They've had... issues, yes.<eos> In fact, it was Dave's keycard that Gabriel stole.<eos> But Dave's been with us a long time.<eos> He's not the type of person to kill anyone, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> You sent an orderly out to recapture a violent, mentally unstable man.<eos> It's possible he was trying to subdue Gabriel and things got out of control.<eos> So, Dave stabs Gabriel, but then loses him in the storm.<eos> Guys, are you hearing that?
- Have you seen this man?<eos> That's the notary who just showed up with legal documents for Mr. Crowne to sign.<eos> Did you give him access to Mr. Crowne?<eos> Yes, but not without an escort.<eos> Varella, come in.<eos> Varella, what's your 20?<eos> - Where did they go?<eos> - Basement.<eos> We're about to start a major renovation. Mr. Crowne's down there alone walking the site.<eos> All right, let's split up. You two go that way, we'll go this way.
No, not that mother...<eos> The other one.<eos> The, uh, stepmother, Rita.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> Once upon a time I was a lawyer with the State Department, and, on an overseas assignment,<eos> Rita was in my convoy going to the embassy.<eos> We were hit. We were taken hostage.<eos> If it hadn't been for Rita, I...<eos> Look, I just owe her, all right?<eos> And when she called and said that you two were sticking your noses into something dangerous and needed a babysitter, I said okay.
Standard infiltrate and extract.<eos> Nyx, you command.<eos> We'll follow.<eos> The Glaive stands together, captain or no.<eos> For hearth.<eos> And home!<eos> We are less than 20 minutes away from the signing of this historic treaty.<eos> I received word of the king's order to deploy.<eos> I'll see to matters in the city.<eos> You have your mission, and it won't be easy.
What of your kings' power now?<eos> They've given you a burden you cannot hope to bear.<eos> I told you before.<eos> Just wanting doesn't win wars.<eos> For the honour of my home, I fought and killed under a king I loathed.<eos> And still he betrayed me.<eos> He betrayed us all.<eos> We fought for the same thing.<eos> All of us.<eos> But you've looked too long on the past.
Hey.<eos> Don't worry about Nyx.<eos> He can take care of himself.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> We must part ways here.<eos> What?<eos> I can hardly travel in secrecy alongside so great a hero.<eos> And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx.<eos> I pray you two see each other again soon.
We must part ways here.<eos> What?<eos> I can hardly travel in secrecy alongside so great a hero.<eos> And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx.<eos> I pray you two see each other again soon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> Thank you, Libertus.<eos> Hey, queen!<eos> You and the king are always welcome in Galahd.
4507 squad, show us responding to shots fired.<eos> - We're six blocks out. - You want the new fancy shower with the whatever and the whatever, you need to work the overtime.<eos> Did I show you the loft on Division?<eos> The one with the toilet next to the stove?<eos> - You are not moving in there.<eos> - It's intimate.<eos> Yeah, so's prison.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Active shooter.<eos> We'll clear downstairs, - you go up.
Ah, they still gotta dig these fragments out.<eos> Oh, did you get shot?<eos> You haven't mentioned it once. Ha ha.<eos> I got a meeting with the medical board at 5:00 to get the surgery approved, so... Good.<eos> Easy peasy...<eos> Doc patches you up, you're back on patrol as soon as your Return to Work form clears.<eos> All good.<eos> And me and Burgess, we'll be partners?<eos> That's kind of a sticky wicket.<eos> HQ doesn't like the idea beca... because you were... because you know what you were at the time of the shooting.
What darkness?<eos> His record was spotless.<eos> Failure.<eos> I don't know what Darren was into, but it wasn't working.<eos> With our help, he turned it around.<eos> Why'd he need 50 grand?<eos> He achieved a new leadership level.<eos> He was an Emerald Tier Guide.<eos> He bought a new level for 50,000.<eos> Yeah, so you put up the cash, he's gotta pay you back by signing in new members.
Take cover!<eos> This is my house!<eos> Lewis!<eos> Lewis, you want to think this through.<eos> Cover me!<eos> Halstead, smoke him out.<eos> Move.<eos> Lewis, you don't want to go down like this.<eos> I'm ready to die!<eos> Are you?
Jesus Christ!<eos> I want my pound of flesh Bea, I'm entitled to it.<eos> Too late! Maxine was in charge and she made the decision.<eos> You must have gone all soft while you were in the slot then.<eos> All that midnight sweet talking with your little Polish princess.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't punish the Koori, me and the boys will be forced to do it for ya.<eos> For fuck's sake!<eos> All right... but I get to choose the punishment.<eos> You're not to lay a finger on her. You got it!
- We're stuck with each other.<eos> It might be fun.<eos> Vera a bit too vanilla for you, Jake?<eos> Okay, let's get this arm dressed.<eos> Bea?<eos> Bea!<eos> They've got Allie.<eos> Juice and her crew.<eos> Where?<eos> Shouldn't you two be at work?
George Dixon.<eos> Okay, what... what's he got to do with Trudy?<eos> He's her father.<eos> Ma.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> A pleasant surprise.<eos> Your collection of botanical literature has grown so fine that you no longer have need of us.<eos> Yet there remain particular texts that you alone have access to.
It doesn't change anything.<eos> It changes everything.<eos> Juliana, please.<eos> Is Dixon still in the Reich?<eos> - You can't tell Arnold...<eos> - Is he?<eos> Brooklyn, last I heard.<eos> All right, what is the big hurry?<eos> Arnold, listen, I have to go, okay?<eos> You leave to leave town, both of you, right now.
To Drew.<eos> My car is at Chili's.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Val, wait.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is there another entrance that doesn't have stairs?<eos> What?<eos> For the gurney.<eos> You're Alex Cole, Valerie Meyers?
Neela, look at me.<eos> Look at me, Neela.<eos> Dr. Choi is gonna take you up to OB, and you are going to deliver this baby.<eos> For your boys.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call OB, tell them we're on our way.<eos> Halstead!<eos> Why'd you dump us?<eos> Dump you?<eos> You dumped me, said you wanted another doctor.
They don't feel equipped to deal with the complications that come with a premature baby.<eos> This is a healthy baby.<eos> She just needs some extra attention.<eos> I understand.<eos> You know, my heart goes out to Neela...<eos> All she's been through.<eos> But I'm not giving up.<eos> I'm sure we can find an adventurous couple willing to take on that little bundle of joy.<eos> And maybe we can get a little something for Neela too.<eos> Of course, you'll get a fee as well.
So, um, how radioactive is it?<eos> To us, harmless.<eos> Still, don't touch it with your bare hands.<eos> So you're not gonna dispose of it?<eos> Not on JCAHO day. Sorry.<eos> Call the radiation safety officer.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I get it.<eos> You didn't do Nathan's bypass surgery. You don't know what you're walking into.
We don't always see eye to eye, but his heart is in the right place.<eos> Well, Dr. Manning, I'm glad your opinion of Dr. Halstead has changed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Halstead, environmental services are on their way? Nope.<eos> Turns out, every department in the hospital's calling ES to handle things they normally take care of themselves.<eos> Be tomorrow before a janitor shows up.<eos> Ah, bureaucracy.<eos> The room is yours again.<eos> Against protocol?<eos> I won't tell if you won't.
- I'm fine.<eos> - All right, let's go over here.<eos> Cardiomegaly.<eos> What?<eos> Michael's heart is enlarged.<eos> What would cause that?<eos> Given everything else, I'd say we're looking at a genetic disease.<eos> How can that be?<eos> We're both fine.<eos> You could each be carrying one faulty recessive gene which, when paired together, can express in Michael.
All units, keep the air clear for mayday transmission.<eos> Here they come!<eos> Help him.<eos> Everyone pull back.<eos> Fight it defensively.<eos> Fire them up!<eos> Oh, no. You can't.<eos> Hey, sir, calm down.<eos> It's going to help you breathe.<eos> You don't understand.
He's been asking for you.<eos> I thought it might finally calm him down.<eos> Hey, Louie.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's asleep.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> Anyway, it's late.<eos> Look, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but there's still a chance.<eos> With Louie back here, you've got a shot again.<eos> You two have a connection.
I could get used to this.<eos> - Stella?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I felt so lonely. I can't survive without you.<eos> Alderman Casey, Susan Weller. Political consultant.<eos> I think you've got a national future ahead of you and I can get you there.<eos> I might actually have a shot at fostering Louie after all.<eos> - What?<eos> - You two have a connection. I won't let that go unnoticed.
Get that roof vented.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Hey, Otis, Mouch, to the roof.<eos> Dawson, Kidd, you're with me.<eos> Hey, we got one on the stairs here!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> I got her.<eos> You two clear the floor.
I need new kids.<eos> You need new parents.
Be on our best behavior.<eos> Solve problems before they happen.<eos> You're Gallaghers now.<eos> And Gallaghers fight for what we deserve.<eos> And we fight dirty.<eos> I got these things from the garage.<eos> I also found a push mower.<eos> So, new Lip, mow the strip between the street and the houses.<eos> New Debbie, grab some shrubs from outside the Citibank on 47th and just stick them anyplace you see dirt.<eos> New Ian and New Carl, here you go.
Exactly who are you protecting?<eos> I saw a woman shooting up at the bus stop.<eos> And the other night, two drunk teens were beating the crap out of each other on my lawn.<eos> Okay. Okay. I hear...<eos> I can make sure that we do our drugs and beat each other up indoors, just like the rest of you folks.<eos> But let's not pretend that our house is any different than your house,<eos> Mr. My Wife Walked Into a Door, over there, or Ms. This Weed Is for my Glaucoma.<eos> Okay. More importantly, we need to take a look at the possible adverse impact on our property values and on the overall quality of life for the community.<eos> We are the community.<eos> We were here first. You bought up all our shit.
She's fine.<eos> She murdered someone, and I don't think she's processing it.<eos> Melissa, have you processed your murder of Darrell?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See?<eos> Good evening, Vietnam.<eos> Tandy, where have you been?<eos> What, uh, Pat and I just blew up the Santa Monica Pier; isn't that cool?<eos> Tandy, look, there are some things you don't know about Pat.<eos> Well, there are some things that you don't know about Pat.
- Ah. Come on.<eos> - Easy 4.<eos> She crushed me. What can I say?<eos> If you give him some love, he'll get back on a roll.<eos> Stop shooting blanks, old man.<eos> I'll give you my number if you roll me something good.<eos> Well, now I got incentive.<eos> No, no, you don't, and no, you won't.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> I take one call from Janet, and you're playing craps?
Thank you.<eos> I owe you one.<eos> Don't mention it. Just doing my job.<eos> No, you know that broad you introduced me to... Sumei? Uh-huh.<eos> Well, she and I are becoming intimately acquainted.<eos> I tell you...<eos> She's one hell of a gal.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Okay, so, you two have been, uh...
I could have died before we ever went to dinner.<eos> And there's nothing you can do?<eos> I'm sorry, Mrs. Zia.<eos> The situation remains the same. He could die on the table. His heart is very weak.<eos> That's not the Clive I know.<eos> The Clive I know goes all-in for what he wants.<eos> Don't badger him, Mom.<eos> He's made up his mind.<eos> We'll let you rest.<eos> Good. You can go.
And I actually pissed myself.<eos> Of course, I told the other soldiers that it was just sweat. But...<eos> Now you don't smell as if you've pissed yourself. I didn't.<eos> Mr. Neville, um, how about you just, uh, try and get some rest, all right?<eos> Save your energy.<eos> One moment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's really out of it.<eos> Early Alzheimer's, maybe dementia?<eos> Hey, how long have you two been married?
Please calm down.<eos> Her blood pressure and oxygen levels are back up.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's update SWAT. I'm sure they've cleared the hospital by now.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We had to shut down the hospital.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> It was in the bomb.<eos> Probably, and since you two just worked on the bomber...
What's going on?<eos> We had to shut down the hospital.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> It was in the bomb.<eos> Probably, and since you two just worked on the bomber...<eos> We could've breathed in spores or gotten it from her blood.<eos> Okay, we need to decontaminate.<eos> Right.<eos> Anyone symptomatic?<eos> Your old man. Multiple Anthrax lesions. Limited to his skin, but we're beginning treatment for everyone, so you two need to go right now.
You're handsome.<eos> You're passionate and romantic. And you have amazing eyes.<eos> You're not a fish with an IQ of minus-60.<eos> Minus-30?<eos> - Put your hand back, please.<eos> - No. I have to go.<eos> Bye, my little fish.<eos> Online media hasn't usurped us yet but our biggest problem is the rent.<eos> You know something, Patrick? I love Marseille. It has such a fascinating history.<eos> And you, at La Provence, you're a part of that history.
But look at your husband. His retirement was to your benefit.<eos> Benefit and detriment.<eos> It's called equality, my friend.<eos> Equality is fine by me, unless it comes from the bedroom.<eos> - Allow me.<eos> - No, I'll get this.<eos> Otherwise, it might seem like you were trying to influence La Provence.<eos> Journalists and politicians make strange bedfellows.<eos> It's really a business relationship.<eos> We just want to sell papers and you just want to buy votes.

It's been a while, but we used to be close.
You know what I want.<eos> The UPM.<eos> You'll get it.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> No news has left the building all morning.<eos> The Mayor is waiting in what's known as the war room...<eos> Costa:<eos> Come now! Everybody's waiting!<eos> Last night I became aware of the manipulation of funds within the UPM Party, during the last presidential election.<eos> As you all know, I helped to create that party 13 years ago.
You can hang around, watch me fire your employees.<eos> Watch me blackball them in the industry.<eos> You know they'll blame you, the founder.<eos> The guy who started it all.<eos> Or you can sign.<eos> They all get to keep their jobs and Snooger becomes a line item on a spreadsheet I glance at every other quarter.<eos> $65,000.<eos> One year's salary for my personal assistant.<eos> Oh, by the way, tell Sarah I say hello.<eos> You two deserve each other.
Ha, ha, in Rogelio's show there's this part, a 1920s lounge singer with an amazing voice who's a silent movie star, but no one can ever hear her.<eos> Oh, that's like Little Mermaid tragic.<eos> But then she gets to sing a song at the end of the episode.<eos> Oh, my God, stop.<eos> Right?<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Should I ask your dad if I can audition?<eos> I don't know if that's a yes or a no.<eos> It means... go for it.<eos> I mean, you and Dad are in a much better place, right?
Someone's a little jelly.<eos> Jelly?<eos> You know, the green-eyed monster?<eos> What?<eos> ! I'm not jealous.<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> This bar should be on the other side of set. We discussed this.<eos> You are not allowed to hire anyone without consulting me first.<eos> So your ex-girlfriend better be great.<eos> Great... so... you'll each have him every other Christmas until he's 18, and then Mateo can choose.
Maybe Juno?<eos> Juno?<eos> Well, if you're changing your relationship status, you've got to come up with a couple name, right?<eos> Are you cheating on Mom?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Then why does she think you are?<eos> Are you planning on leaving her?<eos> Why doesn't she know about the new business manager, Dad?<eos> What are you two talking about?
Okay, this is exactly why I didn't want my mom to come.<eos> I'm not here as your mom. I'm here as your vice principal.<eos> Well, you're talking to me like my mom, which is stressing me out even more than I'm already stressed out, because we just wasted our first round, and I've got minutes to make up for that<eos> pathetic performance that we just did.<eos> So either leave or leave me alone.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi, do you have a moment?<eos> We're... we're looking into the murder of Martha Johnson.<eos> Didn't they already catch the kid who did it?<eos> And aren't you a little young to be cops? Sorry.
- Hey, not bad.<eos> Seriously.<eos> For a girl.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What is she doing? - Maybe you should...<eos> - Maybe you should.<eos> I think we all should.<eos> Hey.<eos> You need to pick us as your alliance.<eos> This is the finals, and you didn't even make it into the top six.
Please don't shoot.<eos> That goes double for you.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> This could've all been much simpler if you'd just picked up on the secure channel.<eos> We installed an emergency override just in case I ever needed to take remote control of my plane.<eos> Your plane?<eos> Yes. Mine.<eos> Hello, Mitch.<eos> Allison.<eos> You two know each other?
All right, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn!<eos> Whoa!<eos> You might want to j...<eos> Let me start by saying, that at some point in your life, you're going to make this mistake.
What are you hanging up?<eos> You saw it. I totally dominated that auction.<eos> Shane wins, because Shane always wins.<eos> Where were we?<eos> - Oh, this is so good... for me and you.<eos> But mostly me.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey! Hi.<eos> I broke up with Shane 'cause he's a crazy person.<eos> Oh, no, 'cause I'm sorry, 'cause I mean if you two can't make it,
Tables get broken.<eos> Innocent boyfriends end up serving time.<eos> Then why do you like it so much?<eos> Because that's how this girl rolls.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I hate it so much. I hate it.<eos> Honey, I wanted to fit in with your friends, but they are exhausting.<eos> No, but I love having both of my worlds come together.<eos> Look, I love your brother and his friends to death, but I just don't know how you can hang out with them all the time, what with the "Whiskey Slap" - and the texting naked pictures,
You and Alexei... you're all I have left in this world.<eos> I couldn't bear to lose either one of you.<eos> I'm going to take Alexei away from all this.<eos> We will disappear.<eos> I want you to come with us.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Bring Clay... and start your own family.<eos> Save yourself from all this madness.<eos> Leave it behind before it destroys you.<eos> They're my family as much as you are.
- Ah, come on.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You wouldn't be lying to me, now, would you?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I say we search them.<eos> I thought I warned you to stay the hell away from here.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Let's get out of here. - Come on.<eos> Much obliged.<eos> You're not from around here.
Well, let's get to work.<eos> Burk, Kara, Tex...<eos> I want you to set a perimeter, motion sensors, bells on a string, whatever we got.<eos> Green, Master Chief...<eos> Establish a comms hub up on that rooftop.<eos> Nathan James is in Emcon, but she'll be listening in.<eos> Wolf, find me a nice, empty building we can drop loudly.<eos> That'll draw the bulk of their forces away when we make our move.<eos> Mike, Sasha...<eos> You're on recon.
I'm trying to get confirmation now.<eos> Manuel, we worked this out.<eos> If this is some kind of ploy...<eos> I had my general on that train to deliver it personally.<eos> I assure you, there is no ploy.<eos> I've got half a dozen power plants that can't work because there's no one there to operate them.<eos> I need bodies.<eos> - Roberta...<eos> - I am not kidding.<eos> This place goes dark, so do you.
- It'll be hard, but I...<eos> - After you got mugged, did you get a makeover?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God! You didn't get beat up.<eos> Your black eye has sparkles in it.<eos> I... I... I can explain.<eos> Then talk fast.<eos> Fine, I faked getting mugged.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why do you think?
Well, we mothers like to think so.<eos> I don't think your son killed my daughter anymore.<eos> I don't.<eos> I just didn't want to let it go, that belief.<eos> But my son, Bobby...<eos> What they told us was wrong all this time.<eos> I'm so, so sorry for your loss, Judy.<eos> I thought if they killed your son, it would help me move on.<eos> Now I just thank the Lord they didn't.<eos> And I hope you can have some kind of life with him, Janet.
I really appreciate your sacrifices over the years.<eos> I don't think it's a sacrifice if it's one's choice.<eos> As I lay in bed last night, I thought... I thought about how many people have tried to help me along the way, have helped me, a few of who are no longer alive.<eos> Way more people have tried to help me, Jon, than have harmed me.<eos> The harm just seems to leave the deeper mark.<eos> Anyway, uh, I've always felt such guilt that others were wasting their lives on me, that I was a waste, that I was unworthy.<eos> But last night, I...<eos> I didn't feel that guilt, or that I was a waste.<eos> I didn't necessarily feel, uh, uh, worthiness, but I did feel a kind of responsibility, I guess.<eos> At least a... a desire to try and not let you all down.
I could do something for your wife...<eos> I could make her boobs as hard as rock...<eos> If that's not the issue,<eos> I could give her a Brazilian ass!<eos> Or I could help you with that nose of yours!<eos> So you are a doctor...<eos> Yes, a plastic surgeon.<eos> Get down, it's no use.<eos> First of all, I want to say something. When you hear the bells, it means that there's a general meeting.<eos> And when there's a general meeting, you must come to it.
Why?<eos> - I left my hat there. - I'll mail it to you.<eos> I'm not leaving without it.<eos> - That way.<eos> - I thought it was this way.<eos> - It's quicker that way.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> EmergerlCY!<eos> Back to the bar!<eos> I never expected you to play cricket here.
I'm not listening to Nu Jazz for the next 5 years.<eos> I'll kill myself, first.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> And Jesus said: "Bring me the fish to multiply..." - Doctor!<eos> - I didn't mean to disturb you.<eos> - Can we help you?<eos> I just came to tell you that in this month that I have spent here I have discovered that Pietramezzana is small, there are no big restaurants and there isn't a big night life...<eos> But I have discovered that there is something authentic here.<eos> You're genuine people and this is hard to find in big cities.
- Do you need help with that box?<eos> - Nope. - No, we're good.<eos> It looks heavy, I can help you.<eos> No, you don't want to get involved,<eos> - trust me. - Please, don't make me say it. Fine, I'll say it.<eos> I don't really want to be alone right now, and so... can I please just... like, come help you guys make bread or whatever?<eos> Aw, of course, yeah.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Got to go quickly, got to go quickly.<eos> Yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go. Did you trash the display?
You recently lost your husband.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I did.<eos> My sincerest condolences.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, you're a single parent.<eos> I am.<eos> And Callie's a single parent.<eos> Is that a question, or...<eos> So you two must help each other out a lot... two single parents.
What are you doing?<eos> Amenadiel.<eos> Amenadiel, no!<eos> Okay, you're gonna be fine.<eos> I'm gonna call an ambulance.<eos> You're gon...<eos> You c...<eos> You're... you're okay.<eos> How?<eos> Okay, this is going to be hard for you to hear, which is why I needed you to see what Lucifer is.
- Because I put it on him.<eos> He knew what he was walking into.<eos> Listen, everything that he does is part of a performance.<eos> All right.<eos> Then what about the weird mojo thing he does?<eos> Neural linguistic programming?<eos> The power of suggestion?<eos> Look, he studied it at a very young age.<eos> And I hate to admit this, but he's actually really good at it.<eos> What about the fact that you two are brothers?
Fine.<eos> Okay, everyone.<eos> The two campaigns have agreed to exchange opposition research.<eos> We show you the worst dirt we have on Susan. You show us the worst dirt you have on Mellie.<eos> Tonight, right now, in front of everybody.<eos> And each side has a decision to make.<eos> Stay in the race or get out.<eos> If you decide to stay in, the dirt will be used - against you publicly.<eos> - And if you decide to get out, the dirt gets buried and you leave the race clean, ready to run another day.<eos> So, this is how you Republicans do it?
This refusal to blink first.<eos> It's not working.<eos> So why?<eos> Why are we even here?<eos> Why, if you're just gonna sabotage all the hard work we've done building Mellie up. Why are we here when we could be...<eos> She wants to know why are you here when you could be saving Jake?<eos> I shouldn't need to explain myself to you two.<eos> You two are supposed to be gladiators.<eos> You should get it, you should know.<eos> You two should be over a cliff with me, and instead I'm sitting here having you beg me to explain your job to you.
He decided to go another way.<eos> Who calls saying you're not getting the call?<eos> Who'd they dump you for?<eos> No idea.<eos> All they said was that it wasn't going to be me.<eos> How the hell did you mess this up?<eos> Fitz: Thank you!<eos> We're here to nominate a president...<eos> [Cheers and applause] and I've got one in mind.<eos> [Cheers and applause continue] Sounds like you've got someone in mind, too.
Does it show?<eos> I mean, I know we have the gesture, but still.<eos> Such a little girl. It's cool. All right, when all this is over,<eos> I'm gonna go my way and you can go back to your cushy vanilla life, where you feel real comfortable and not scared. I'm scared there, too.<eos> - Hola, corazon.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We gotta send a message!<eos> Let everybody know from Overtown to Carol City.<eos> If a nigga think he gonna fuck with us in our hood, little Haiti, we're gonna come at you ten times bigger.<eos> You kill one of us, we gonna kill ten of y'all.

It's a worthwhile question.<eos> Have you ever known me to be intimidated?<eos> I'm not here to counsel surrender.<eos> Just that you proceed with caution.<eos> The depravity of these people is unmatched.<eos> We'll see.<eos> So I don't blame you for keeping Watson and me at arm's length.<eos> But now is the time to let us in.<eos> If for no other reason than you might not live to see this through.<eos> You'll keep me apprised of any leads that you and the police may develop?
And Moriarty's detention was your opportunity.<eos> Are you familiar with The Invisible Hand?<eos> It's a metaphor used by Adam Smith to describe social benefits arising from individual actions.<eos> Are you suggesting that you're an invisible hand?<eos> Because if you can explain to me how blowing up buildings and turning psychopaths into assassins is benefitting society, I might register for one of your classes.<eos> When Jamie went away, there was chaos.<eos> Alliances she helped forge fell apart.<eos> Our best people were fighting themselves.<eos> I brought order, stability.<eos> How did you two know each other?
Well, you know what?<eos> It won't work on me because I am a sober, sane and emotionally well-balanced woman who is on her way to do great things!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, who'd like...<eos> Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.<eos> - All:<eos> Hi, Bonn... - Save it!<eos> I would just like to say that evil comes in many shapes and sizes, including pixie.<eos> You all know me, you know that I mean well, that I always come from love.
Wendy:<eos> Hold your horses. Let me just check on 216.<eos> It's Nurse Ratchet.<eos> Masks up.<eos> Please tell me I'm not seeing three visitors in this room at the same time.<eos> Oh, come on, Wendy.<eos> Hospital rules.<eos> Only two visitors at a time.<eos> Somebody's got to go.<eos> You two grab a snack.
There were a beast with you last night?<eos> How about a wild moose?<eos> There was something that made sounds.<eos> There was something that made sounds. Hanne couldn't sleep at all.<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Is it so thin walls? I woke up by a thumping sound.<eos> Am I the only one who heard it?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, it was not us.<eos> It was exactly how you sounded.
We rent a workshop from Erkki.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know him?<eos> Yes, I have met him.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers<eos> What are you doing way out here?<eos> Johan there, I am his girlfriend.<eos> He's considering to buy this place. Mm, nice.<eos> How long have you...
You still don't believe me. No.<eos> Nobody knows who he is.<eos> A few do, and now you're one of them.<eos> Why would you tell me?<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> I'm a pretty good judge of character.<eos> I'm fairly certain I can trust you.<eos> If you still need proof, I can give it to you.<eos> How?<eos> Well, you two look like you're up to no good.
It's your piece of shit brother, killing on the count of your killing. You're goddamned animals.<eos> There is a candle, sir.<eos> No!<eos> Mathilda, we had to catch him!<eos> Mr. Reid, sir?<eos> Mr. Reid, how was he even taken?<eos> It sounds as though you surrendered.<eos> Why?<eos> So to what end, hmm?<eos> Did you and the captain find Robin's killed mother and uncle?
What...<eos> I do not suggest such a thing.<eos> Then what?<eos> We ask one more service of our host.<eos> Will you leave us a moment, Inspector Drummond? Yes, sir.<eos> All of London is a clamour sir.<eos> The capital's press is therefore to be gathered at Scotland Yard tomorrow morning, where I shall explain to them the ugly whys and wherefores of how it is the leading police of Whitechapel are either murdered or murdering.<eos> I'm sure you understand, therefore, what a service you would render should you give full account of all you know.<eos> Your friends have killed once more.<eos> More blood, the spattering of which lands on your shirt cuffs, Mr. Reid, for you know where they might be found and will not say.

I heard what it was he said to your brother before your brother took his throat out.<eos> Bennet said that to see him was only looking in a mirror... and now, you and I, here, facing reflections of our own.<eos> I know you are sincere, Mr. Dove, sincere in your hope that the world will be righted and renewed, the pitiless murk of the past be obliterated and forgot.<eos> It is an ambition I once nurtured myself.<eos> Indeed, I would dispute with all who would insist that such an ambition was hopeless.<eos> This journey here, ours, began with a man named Isaac Bloom.<eos> You recall the name.<eos> Isaac was a mathematician.<eos> He believed that numbers betrayed the true nature of our universe, and accordingly, it was empirically proved that the entropy of the universe extended to a maximum, that everything moved irretrievably from order into chaos.<eos> You do not believe that, do you?
Samuel Drummond is innocent of all and must remain so.<eos> Sir, the candle, Miss Mathilda... how can you defend...<eos> He was trying for the love of her.<eos> I am certain of it.<eos> After all the bickering and the petty jostlings with a, are you not similarly convinced his heart is a true one?<eos> Whichever, Sergeant, it serves no purpose to ruin his sense of the world, not yet, at any rate.<eos> Then I'll ask you again, sir.<eos> What must we do now?<eos> Not we, Francis Thatcher... you.<eos> - You're Miss Mathilda Reid. - Yes.
This were a means to protect it.<eos> And that means was a lie.<eos> In the days after you were found taken into my care, oh, your mind fevered wondering the damaged spirit child that Mr. Buckley had made you believe that you were, your father, Mr. Reid, came looking for you.<eos> And I told him you were dead.<eos> And worse, Matilda, for all Mr. Buckley's gentleness to you,<eos> I described a vision of horror to your father, that you had been chained and starved and violated all those years that you'd been gone from him.<eos> So, yes, he took Horace Buckley's life, but with my hands, Mathilda...<eos> my hands... my hands... just as though he were my puppet.<eos> It's true, Miss Reid, all of it.<eos> Yet, you love her still.

On that matter, it is my own strategy, Captain, and I very much hope it shan't come to that.<eos> And that strategy being what?<eos> Francis Thatcher is going to exhume the body of Robin Sumner.<eos> I thought you said you left that boy to rest.<eos> He rests, Augustus Dove prevails.<eos> Now, he may rest in due course again, but it is that boy who will give his own tragedy... his family's here, Bennet Drake's, Isaac Bloom's... it is that boy who will hand them their justice, even if I<eos> have handed mine alongside.<eos> And how's the boy to do that, Reid.<eos> That boy cannot speak.<eos> The dead can always speak, Captain, when you are there to aid them.
Mathilda Reid.<eos> Mr. Abeline, on another occasion, the men of H Division will gladly welcome you, but as you might have heard, we are sorely pressed at the present moment.<eos> Who... this?<eos> This is Inspector Drummond.<eos> This is him?<eos> The milksop with whom you bring yourself into shame and disrepute?<eos> Mathilda, really?<eos> Looks like he might bow to blow the head off a pint of mild.<eos> Nonetheless, sir, this is my command, and I ask you why you've brung yourself here today of all days.<eos> I would see my friend before you and your master have his neck choked at new light.
Be quiet. Be quiet!<eos> Nathaniel!<eos> Nathaniel, you leave her be!<eos> Will you... will you take Connor?<eos> And leave you here?<eos> He's a friend.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You brought him here.<eos> Why?<eos> Miss Susan, you told me, and I had to ask him because he... he is my brother.
How else would they see the chemicals?<eos> I knew there was no way that happened for real!<eos> So the balance of power has been restored.<eos> You can be you again.<eos> It's not that easy!<eos> The whole school witnessed this once-in-a-lifetime moment. It can't be undone.<eos> Actually, I think it can.<eos> Okay!<eos> Not that complicated, people.<eos> I call your name, and then you go up and get the piece of paper.
I'm still walking.<eos> So, guys, tell us everything.<eos> What would you say is your favorite part of this room?<eos> That it's so close to everything.<eos> We love that.<eos> - So, are you guys graduating? - Nope.<eos> Oh!<eos> Did you get a nice house?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, we drew number 562 in the lottery, so now you get to kick us out and we get to get stuck with whatever sucky room is left after everybody else on the whole campus gets to pick.
I can use a little more... right here. Hey!<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> It's just cheese, dude.<eos> Kenny.<eos> We got some customers.<eos> Kenny, wait. Where are you going?<eos> This is the post-hangover, pre-drunk rush.<eos> They need to line their stomachs with more cheese for another night of partying.<eos> While people are frequently enigmatic, with food, I've found a language with which I can express myself.<eos> But you've taken that and made it all about money.
Stop! Taking her away from you, handsome stranger.<eos> I'm his cousin.<eos> We just came here together.<eos> Quiet, you crinkum-crankum, you fat witch.<eos> I'm not a witch.<eos> If I'm a witch, he's a witch.<eos> Tell them, Jeff.<eos> Come on.<eos> Does she speak the truth, sir?<eos> Are you also the vicar of Satan?
I wanted to make this work.<eos> I wanted to save you.<eos> There is no saving us.<eos> Not if we stay the same.<eos> Most of you knew Karen Morgan.<eos> She came from Baltimore, and she had hopes of settling into our community.<eos> These heinous crimes are being thoroughly investigated at the county and state level.<eos> And I can assure you that we at Bear Valley City Hall will be there to hear your concerns.<eos> May I help you, bud?<eos> You are the ones who can help.
Two hundred twenty-three dollars...<eos> And 75 cents.<eos> Mm. Oh, my God, I'm crazy...<eos> Properly boozed and debt-free...<eos> What a way to live.<eos> Uh, one second, please.<eos> Neil?<eos> I took the bus.<eos> I met a redheaded girl with big tatas.<eos> Uh, you two know each other?
- You okay?<eos> Shit.<eos> That guy you fried with your clever little trap?<eos> - That was our cousin.<eos> - Cuz.<eos> That's Brother.<eos> Sonny.<eos> You can call me Father.<eos> And you two?<eos> You two are the kids.
Where'd he go?<eos> God!<eos> He escaped while you idiots were stuffing your faces.<eos> -It was your idea.<eos> -Yeah, well, you took too long.<eos> He's probably long gone. The scrips, too.<eos> - Nah, he's still in the house.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Hunch.<eos> You two search the main floor.
You gonna help us?<eos> What do we do?<eos> You all are sick with the kuru virus, you know that?<eos> Quiet.<eos> Sonny shot you because you were aware.<eos> So?<eos> If he knew you were aware, why would he send you to get us?<eos> Sonny would expect him to betray him.<eos> What?<eos> You two really are mercs.
You mean the kind of person who actually tries to make things work instead of fighting with anybody who threatens her "savior complex"?<eos> I get along fine with people.<eos> You alienate everybody.<eos> Says the woman that will take any excuse not to go home to her husband. - Hey.<eos> - Why don't we see if your marriage lasts the year before you start doling out relationship advice? - Donna?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Enough!<eos> Hey, this meeting is over, all right?<eos> My God!<eos> You two go to your corners, wipe the blood off your mouths, and we will revisit...
- Well, it's fine. It's not important, we'll cut out cup-ons.<eos> Coupons.<eos> Why is she talking to the realtor?<eos> I will handle it, okay?<eos> It's-it's tot... it's... Oh.<eos> Jess?<eos> I'm so sorry, do you mind if I just steal her away for a minute?<eos> Jessica?<eos> Hey, honey, this can't happen.<eos> You're right, this is not your house.
Shot dead the day before yesterday by the Japanese.<eos> So is there anyone living whose name you can give us?<eos> If there was anyone else I could identify, I would.<eos> What about the man who shot at you when you escaped from that car?<eos> Surely you can always describe him.<eos> It was Lemuel Washington who shot at me.<eos> There was no other man, not that I'm aware of.<eos> That is... disappointing.<eos> We have received a request from the Japanese authorities for the immediate return of Miss Crain, sir.<eos> I know you don't owe me anything.
It's the only way that I'll ever be able to trust you.<eos> His name was Damien.<eos> And he was a bad, bad dude.<eos> You did the world a favor by getting rid of him.<eos> Why was he trying to kill you?<eos> I owed him a lot of money.<eos> From gambling.<eos> Look, I thought I'd be able to leave my debts in the past and make a fresh start in Ladner, but he found me.<eos> And that's the truth.<eos> You think that was impressive?
I never met him, but I talked to him on the phone.<eos> He was quite impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, this is what I can do.<eos> Look, I need to deal with Veteran Affairs first.<eos> - How's that going?<eos> - It'll happen.<eos> - But not yet?<eos> - It'll happen.<eos> Look, I need to sit down with the CDC spokesperson and discuss it, but I need for you to talk with this congressional adviser first.
Wait a minute, how did all you guys get into my apartment?<eos> An emotional intervention? Come on!<eos> Whose idea was this?<eos> Not yours because you're too cool.<eos> He's right, I am. You don't like me enough.<eos> He's right, I don't.<eos> And you don't like to share me, so if this was your idea, it'd be just the two of us somewhere...<eos> Dolphin-watching for two in Catalina.<eos> Leaves every hour if you still want to go.<eos> This whole nonsense has you two hippy-dippy nerds written all over it. You need help.
All right.<eos> Crap, now I have to plan a bachelor party.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Hi, I'd like to, uh, say a few words about my father Jack Martino.<eos> There's an expression I say, uh, um, "Every day is a gift, but life doesn't have a return policy."<eos> My dad and I loved to listen to the radio... and sit in the backyard, and we would listen to the Angels game together but I pretended to love it because it was the classic father-son thing to do.<eos> Truth is, I didn't know anything about baseball.<eos> I didn't know what the hell the announcers were talking about, but it was the only thing I could do with my father where we didn't have to talk to each other.<eos> My dad wasn't a great guy.<eos> He was selfish, and he was rude... that's why you're all here instead of his real friends but he was my dad and I wish he were still alive today because he never got to meet my family.
eventual assimilation or immediate annihilation.<eos> Their descendants have had ten generations to suck the wealth out of the Quad and honor the deal.<eos> What you're seeing in Old Town right now is the beginning of that handover.<eos> A silent invasion has begun.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> No, this is bullshit. This is... this is crazy bullshit!<eos> How can you be so calm about all this?<eos> Well, to be fair, I've had a lot longer to process.<eos> Centuries.<eos> You do not have that luxury.
And for a little more every year, you do qualify for our Gold Package.<eos> It's the ultimate in breach-proof security.<eos> Something quite special.<eos> We don't need anything exotic, thank you.<eos> Just the basic package.<eos> We'll select her vault another time. We're needed elsewhere today.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There's one more level of security I should mention.<eos> Me.<eos> I'm very good at reading people, and you two read wrong.
- Burn.<eos> - Oh... so rude.<eos> Oh... you don't get it.<eos> That's 30 years of science down the tubes.<eos> Whoa, whoa...<eos> Oh, my God, Mike.<eos> Just take the bottle, huh?<eos> Come on, it's really good.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Who do you think's flying that thing?
Right.<eos> - You've reached Andrew Talman.<eos> - Please leave a message.<eos> Andrew?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Prick.<eos> This girl's so smart.<eos> I mean, child prodigy, went to Stanford, she just has absolutely no idea how to sell herself.<eos> Yeah, but there has to be a reason why people aren't buying.<eos> Like, you're the only one.
You don't need to copy Headquarters about our arrival. I will do that.<eos> James here will draft a message for your commo to send.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Barely.<eos> Probably not smart to be here.<eos> Probably not.<eos> Clay Williams... he's trying to kill you. He made a deal with Hans.<eos> Why did you call to warn me?<eos> I'd be one less person that knew you and Hans were running Thomas Shaw.
- Good morning. Ah!<eos> Good morning!<eos> What are you wearing? A tablecloth?<eos> I've come to pick up the "little thing".<eos> Look! You didn't even buy him a pyjama!<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Come on, get him dressed.<eos> Get a move on. We have to go.<eos> - I want my dad.<eos> I don't know who you are.
- I thought he was dead.<eos> - His spirit...<eos> - Where's the boy? - The boy?<eos> What boy, excuse me?<eos> Bye.<eos> Ruggero?<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Do you see him?<eos> No, you don't see him.
No! No... it's Giacomo.<eos> Hello, Giacomo.<eos> I was going to call you.<eos> Listen, this moment is complicated enough...<eos> No, no, no. Don't even try.<eos> Don't even try!<eos> No, I'm not talking to you.<eos> Do you see him?<eos> No, you don't see him.<eos> You've never seen him.
No, he's not my husband!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He's not my husband...<eos> Speak in Chinese!<eos> We speak two different dialects. We're from different regions.<eos> Nobody will notice!<eos> How strange, they speak two different dialects.<eos> Look, this is not a language school. We sell houses here.<eos> Let's not talk about dialects.<eos> You go. Take the boy away with you.
- Sure! - Everything is a conflict of interest in life.<eos> - Really?<eos> Do you know why she did it?<eos> To take the child away from me.<eos> And to solve her problems at home.<eos> It suited you.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stop it, both of you!<eos> I'm talking now!<eos> And I'll decide what to do, since all you've been able to do so far, is argue with each other, with a total disregard for Paolo's will.
It's Giacomo. Hi, Giacomo. I'm in a delicate situation.<eos> - "Delicate"!<eos> - I know I always say that, but it's really delicate.<eos> Are you having an art show?<eos> He's having an art show! - May I see your ID?<eos> - She's on the phone! Wait a second!<eos> Sorry, I have to go now, Giacomo.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Let go of her!<eos> Tell me your names. You don't realize how much trouble you're getting in.
Why are you lying?<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you lying?<eos> Why are you lying? Why?<eos> Ma'am!<eos> We've done everything to accommodate you.<eos> Please don't make a scene here!<eos> I'm making a scene?<eos> If you've done your job as a security, none of these would happen to us!
(audience groans and laughs)<eos> His neck's a little rusty, but that's a no.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I would make us a drink but without a liquor license, all I can make is meth. This is all my fault.<eos> No, I was in a funk about Randy and you had to do all this stuff on your own.<eos> -Okay, good.<eos> That's what I really thought, but I just wanted to make sure it was out there.<eos> We have zero luck, Max, zero.<eos> I just stopped by to say I'm sorry about your dessert bar.<eos> You two are unlucky A,F.
As am I.<eos> Girls, two questions... - No.<eos> - And no.<eos> I was coming to see how baby Barbara's baptism was coming.<eos> Also, what drink goes best with a heavy muscle relaxer?<eos> I'd try the nipple-tini or the piña co-nipple.<eos> Oleg, are you okay?<eos> I haven't seen you this wound up since California passed that law to make porn actors wear condoms.<eos> It ruins the visuals.<eos> You're the godparents, and my mama is coming all the way from the Ukraine for this baptism, so it's got to be balls to the walls perfect.
Learned that the hard way.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Golishevsky.<eos> You look so nice.<eos> I don't look nice.<eos> I look fantastic.<eos> This is Father Kozac.<eos> He will be performing the baptism.<eos> Yes, and I also perform in an RB group.<eos> You may have heard of us: Altar Boys to Men?<eos> You two have to wear this on your heads, to show respect for God.
I don't think so.<eos> It must have been horrible to see that murder.<eos> Yes, I was only 9. -<eos> - Not exactly a "tough guy"...<eos> I had nightmares for a long time. -<eos> - And now you're a marine biologist. Yes.<eos> Don't you have to meet Jakob?<eos> -<eos> - Yes, we're going to Berns'.<eos> You should come too!
Detective Cutter.<eos> Mrs. Ross.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> It sounded like there was some sort of commotion.<eos> That was just me getting to the door.<eos> - What's this about?<eos> - We're looking for your brother, Cam.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Cam doesn't live here.<eos> But you two are pretty close.
I can't face Josh.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Hey, Yolanda.<eos> I just found out my daughter's not gonna make my party.<eos> I mean, it's hard enough turning the big five-oh, but now none of my kids are gonna be there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, Yolanda,<eos> - I'm really sorry, but I don't think...<eos> - Oh well.<eos> The only thing that's gonna make it better is... you're gonna be there.
But I think I'll leave that particular ordeal to someone more qualified.<eos> Right.<eos> Step out.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, my word.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> You don't quit, do you?<eos> I came by to let you know that tomorrow's paper is gonna lay out Bullock's story of how Fish got away.<eos> How she just... vanished while you two were escaping.
He's gone.<eos> - He cut his hair.<eos> - To look more like you.<eos> Does Alfred know you have his car?<eos> Would you like to go for a ride?<eos> The ticking synchronizes with your heartbeat.<eos> Deep down, you want to die, Jim.<eos> Step off the ledge.<eos> Stop!<eos> You don't understand.
It was my shift at the bio lab, but I...<eos> - The only thing you're coming down with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> That's no way to treat a sick man.<eos> Listen, Sullivan,<eos> Tetch got in using an employee's key card.<eos> Just show us your card, and you're free to go.<eos> Screw you.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> You pigs think you're such tough guys...
Excuse me, did you notice the rather... severe-looking woman I was speaking with?<eos> She said her name...<eos> What is this?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I'm afraid your evening has been hijacked, Mr. Mayor.<eos> I see the champagne didn't leave a mark.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jervis Tetch.<eos> I promise not to take up too much of your time.<eos> But the fact is, you... are the heads of Gotham.
You're back.<eos> I'm back.<eos> I suppose it was only a matter of time.<eos> Once a cop, always a cop.<eos> For better or worse, this is where I belong.<eos> How's Vale?<eos> Good.<eos> I think.<eos> She's out of the hospital, anyway.<eos> - You two are not...?
Can I ask who?<eos> Dr. Maxwell Symon.<eos> - He's a...<eos> - Plastic surgeon.<eos> You arrest him, you're gonna have to fight off every woman here.<eos> He's a favorite.<eos> He's also a murderer.<eos> I'd be curious to know how your father knows him.<eos> I'm sure that their relationship is completely above board.<eos> While you two hash this out, I'm gonna go grab Symon.
And just like that... you suddenly realize it's your voice.<eos> The one you've been denying. Telling you who you are.<eos> What you have to do.<eos> And then you stop fighting.<eos> And this calm comes over you.<eos> Sex trafficking.<eos> Drugs.<eos> Murder.<eos> I've kept files on all three of you for years.<eos> Waiting for the proof we needed while you sneered at the law.
Why is this necklace so important?<eos> What'd make someone kill for it?<eos> Who cares?<eos> ! Are you crazy?<eos> That's worth $5,000.<eos> What is it?<eos> A key.<eos> We should really go, Bruce.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You two are a couple now?
This one is rarely occupied and always well guarded, and there are two alarms.<eos> The first covers points of entry.<eos> Last week, we managed to disarm one of the windows.<eos> Once inside, the front door can be opened using a code that we possess.<eos> The second alarm is in the basement.<eos> In the room with the safe.<eos> The floor is fitted with infrared sensors.<eos> You must cross it on a rope.<eos> I have trained for this.<eos> You will give me the key you found, and I will retrieve the object.
You actually have all the power.<eos> Just say the word, and you can decide who gets to live and who gets to spend the rest of eternity in never-ending emotional torment.<eos> Oh, you guys know about that, right?<eos> They're homicidal monsters.<eos> They have done the worst things imaginable.<eos> Where do you think they're gonna end up?<eos> Some cloud-filled afterlife?<eos> No.<eos> They're going to the other place, where all they will know is loneliness and despair forever and ever and ever.<eos> You two forget that I don't care about anything anymore.
I just need to do something.<eos> Caroline, if something happens to those girls....<eos> - I know. - Look, they shouldn't be living this life.<eos> I know!<eos> You know, when we get them back, I'm taking them away.<eos> As far away from all of you as possible.<eos> All of...?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Darkness follows vampires everywhere you go.<eos> That's what you attract.
Don't worry, brother.<eos> I got a get out of hell free card right here in my pocket.<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> I won't ask you again.<eos> I'll be happy to take you to 'em.<eos> Just need you to agree to a few terms first.<eos> So... you want your freedom in exchange for these two sweet girls.<eos> I told you he wouldn't go for it.<eos> Actually, I'm intrigued.<eos> What do you think?
Enzo, do come in, young man.<eos> Enzo, no!<eos> I'm not gonna harm him.<eos> Or you.<eos> I'm not Sybil. Okay.<eos> We'll just leave, then.<eos> Without the weapon?<eos> That is what you came for.<eos> Sybil left for Mystic Falls.<eos> You two show up here.
- All right.<eos> I'm gonna go pay the check.<eos> I am so winning this bet.<eos> No, I'm winning it, he thinks I'm adorable, despite looking like Edna from The Incredibles.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> I'm getting the second date.<eos> - No, I'm getting the second date!<eos> - You don't...<eos> - You're not gonna win that bet!<eos> - Do you two know each other?
No!<eos> I just feel like that hotel sounds like so much fun!<eos> Yeah!<eos> It's an exciting adventure!<eos> An adventure that ends with a trip to the free clinic!<eos> Josh, is there some reason you don't want us to stay here?<eos> Pfft. No, no, no.<eos> I mean, look, I don't know what the big deal is.<eos> I think you guys are blowing this way out of proportion.<eos> There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why you can't sleep with me.
- Together?<eos> I thought you two decided to be just friends.<eos> Yeah, we did, but our parts didn't.<eos> So then what's the problem?<eos> Is the sex bad?<eos> - No, it's good. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, but if we keep doing it, it's gonna lead to a relationship, and you saw what happens when we try that.<eos> So, just stop the sex before you start having feelings.<eos> Okay, but how are we gonna know which sex time that's gonna be?<eos> Well, how many times do you two think you could do it before all the emotions kick in?
Don't think he'd start with God.<eos> He made a deal?<eos> Wait.<eos> Is that a weak spot?<eos> Are those... tears?<eos> You're a bad mother.<eos> I think you might be projecting a little bit.<eos> How's that?<eos> Well, you keep trying to pin murders on your own mother.<eos> I'm guessing you and her don't have the best relationship.
Does that mean I was meant to take you back to Hell or was he insinuating that Hell was getting drafty?<eos> Nobody bloody knows, because the selfish bastard won't just tell us!<eos> And I'm sick of it.<eos> No more.<eos> No more.<eos> There's my Lightbringer.<eos> My Morningstar.<eos> Uriel was so small when he was a child.<eos> All he ever wanted was to play with you and the older kids.<eos> But you all excluded him. Yes.
Just give me a moment.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You sure this is the right place?<eos> Duncan Watts, Maze.<eos> That's the name Lucifer gave me.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Even if we find the blade, it's a temporary fix.<eos> Your mom is the problem.<eos> She released the blade to create chaos, and you two respond by coddling her.
Yeah?<eos> Have you ever brought down a building before?<eos> I know how it's done.<eos> I need you to destroy a nightclub for me.<eos> Let's get out of here, guys.<eos> Hands off... - my piano!<eos> - Hey, man, we're just doing a job.<eos> We don't want any trouble.<eos> You think you can come in here and take apart my life without any trouble?<eos> You gentlemen have no idea who you're dealing with, do you?
I don't think this is something you need to be smiling about.<eos> Well, you said the magic word.<eos> It's "we."<eos> I mean, that's how it's always be, Luous and Cookie, you know?<eos> You and me against is crazy-ass world and... us versus everyby else. Excusey interruption.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to tnk you bot for today. We couldn't have done without both of your support.<eos> You kn, a lot of these kids, they come from broken homes. You know, uh, divorce, separation...<eos> Some parts never even were together in the first place.<eos> So it just means a lot toave these kids see you two together, gettg along even though you're not marri anymore.
All right, okay.<eos> Look... we hired Xavier Rosen.<eos> - Who? ! - I'm sorry.<eos> He starts tomorrow.<eos> You mean the Jewish dude pretending he's black?<eos> ! Look, he is an encyclopedia when it comes to hip-hop and RB.<eos> And he has the digital marketplace on lockdown, Lucious.<eos> That should make you happy.<eos> Empire XStream is your baby.<eos> No, what makes me happy is you two no longer have any excuse for this lack of accountability.
Feds don't leak information, big brother;<eos> we gather it and use it to lock all you criminals away.<eos> What?<eos> What is that?<eos> What the hell is it now?<eos> Ma?<eos> Now, what the hell y'all looking at?<eos> ! They perky.<eos> Move!<eos> I just got a call from Angelo's campaign manager asking if you leaked that picture of me to mess with his announcement.
I was trying to date Ms. Lyon.<eos> Uh, she kept me at arm's length, and just as I was about to get somewhere with her, you guys messed that up.<eos> To be honest, she just broke up with me today.<eos> So are we good now?<eos> Now, can we start dealing with the real issues that New York City's people have to deal with?<eos> You don't think the invasion of a woman's privacy is important?<eos> - Are you gonna answer?<eos> - You know what, you're right.<eos> Um... this is but one of many examples of women being disrespected in today's society.<eos> You all know that women's equality is... high up on my priority list, so...
I'll tell you.<eos> I'll tell you everything, okay?<eos> First off, who's Angry Spice?<eos> She, uh -- she's -- she's Men of Letters.<eos> Uh, British Men of Letters.<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> What the hell? Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> So, to recap -- you live in the Men of Letters bunker, awash in the world's greatest collection of occult knowledge, and yet you know "nothing."
Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, we're here because your previous case worker, Olivia Sanchez, has passed away.<eos> What happened?<eos> We're not sure yet.<eos> How often did she visit?<eos> Every few months.<eos> We liked her better than the other one -- that Beth.<eos> And what was wrong with Beth?<eos> She hated us because of our faith.<eos> Olivia Sanchez was a Papist, but... at least she believed in God.<eos> Hmm. Do you know God, gentlemen?
This only ends one way.<eos> We should get back.<eos> Yeah. Oh, uh, don't say "Wendigo" to anyone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was nice, wasn't it?<eos> And Asa made us go roller skating, and right after these ghouls almost got us.<eos> So there's the three of us, all banged up, with a ton of ironic teenagers skating under these neon lights.<eos> You remember this, Jody?<eos> Mm-hmm. Oh, it was classic.<eos> I mean, you know, until you two snuck off for some sweet, sweet time alone.
Yeah, so your safest place is with us right now.<eos> Uh-huh. Safe from... Nazi zombies.<eos> Necromancers. They use blood magic to make themselves almost immortal.<eos> Almost?<eos> Well, you shoot 'em in the head, set 'em on fire, that usually does the trick.<eos> This is completely insane.<eos> Ellie, you saw what they did to your friend.<eos> Okay, but... why -- why would they kill Nick? And why kidnap me?<eos> Those are great questions.<eos> What do you tools want with the watch?
Oh, no, sure I can. See, I do it all the time.<eos> Oh, my... You don't wanna watch this.<eos> All right!<eos> It belongs to my father.<eos> Commandant Nauhaus.<eos> Thule High Command? Ranking officer?<eos> Okay.<eos> See, that wasn't so hard now, was it?<eos> Carry on.<eos> You don't understand.
Okay?<eos> See ya.<eos> People drop their phones all the time.<eos> She said you pushed her.<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> Why would I push her?<eos> That's my question, Rene.<eos> You know, phones break, not a big deal.<eos> What is a big deal is bullying.<eos> You know, you make your own choices, guys.
Step aside, please.<eos> Kamilah Davis...<eos> So what do these guys have to do with your investigation?<eos> They're Vescovi's. They were making a play to distribute heroin.<eos> Chris Petronelli.<eos> Does that ring a bell? No, these guys are foot soldiers, so not our priority.<eos> I'm gonna need to log that wallet.<eos> You got much trouble with the Vescovi's in Tivoli?<eos> No, I just hand them speeding tickets when they're passing through.<eos> Well, you might want to keep it that way.
♫ You're gonna get what I've got ♫ -It was his ears.<eos> -Just like you said.<eos> No Asperger's.<eos> They took the cyst out right then and there... 45 minutes.<eos> His hearing is fine, and he's happy.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened here.<eos> I have a crew coming this afternoon to fix your window, the plaster, all of it.<eos> My brother-in-law is a contractor.<eos> They do good work.<eos> - You don't have to do...
Well, that's news to us.<eos> He never shared it with the Americans.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> "He"-- you mean Director David?<eos> That's right.<eos> Ziva's father.<eos> With him dead, I assumed she inherited his private files.<eos> That's why I was looking for her.<eos> Maybe I would've found her on my own, maybe not.<eos> But you never would've found me.
Thank you.<eos> And here.<eos> Yeah, there's no way - this isn't awkward. - Oh.<eos> Assorted colors. How fun.<eos> So, anyone care for a drink? Yes. Yes.<eos> Thank you. - Sí, sí, sí.<eos> - Me, too!<eos> In fact, I have an idea.<eos> Every time something awkward happens at this brunch, let's take a sip of our mimosas.<eos> Kids, you have orange juice.
I bet Childan's tearing his hair out.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Gary: Come on, Ed.<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> Oi.<eos> More whiskey.<eos> And you will drink it with us.<eos> Of course, Onoda-kakka.<eos> I'm afraid I don't drink whiskey.<eos> You two make a fine pair, And I order you to leave that button undone.
It must be fun riding up here, all this space.<eos> Liking Philip out here, the way I do, it's hard.<eos> I know.<eos> It will get easier.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yeah. I-I'll see you.<eos> - I got to go hunting with my Dad. - Okay.<eos> Lukas doesn't have a mom.<eos> He seems like a really sweet kid.<eos> Hey, are you two...
No.<eos> What, Lukas?<eos> What happened?<eos> Philip... he made me steal from my dad to buy drugs.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, he wanted me to take some with him too, but I-I didn't.<eos> Is that true, Philip?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Whatever Lukas says.<eos> Well, I'm gonna let you two decide how to discipline Philip.
Thank God.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Can I offer you something?<eos> - No, I...<eos> I just want to ask Philip.<eos> No, no, that's all done.<eos> I thought about it.<eos> Sometimes a man's got to admit when he's wrong.<eos> Lukas still needs to hear from his friends.<eos> I know you two were tight.
I volunteered to be here.<eos> You promised that if I could prove my consciousness, I would be given the chance of a fair trial.<eos> What would you do with your freedom, Niska?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Isn't that the point of freedom?<eos> You can do anything with it.<eos> Or nothing.<eos> What do you feel about us humans?<eos> You can be loving, you can be kind, you can be cruel.<eos> You're always trying to kill each other.
Oh, you just gonna skip off like that?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - You have no idea what we been through the past month!<eos> Had our lives turned upside down, breaking our back for this company!<eos> You know what?<eos> Suck my dick, both of you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, you're lucky I let you be a part of this in the first place.<eos> This is my company, my idea, my baby, my code.<eos> You had jack shit to do with it.
That was just for fun.<eos> Nice work.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> I hacked his shit way before you came to us.<eos> Our girl got trust issues.<eos> So... what's the catch?<eos> The catch... is that you're not gonna use that to blackmail him.<eos> You... work for us now.<eos> You're gonna use it to bring him down without implicating us in any legal activity.<eos> I don't think you understand how this works.
I'm afraid it's a case of 'no pain, no grain'.<eos> Yeah, Prof, the company bought this gold jug for the tournament later. Mm-hm.<eos> So we'll need a bit more pain, then.<eos> Sorry.<eos> the guy with the monobrow and Lena the cleaner.<eos> What?<eos> You can't fire Lena!<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> End of meeting, everyone back to work.<eos> Apart from those who've been sacked. You have to go.
You know what...<eos> Everybody, Bishop and I are...<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I've never been more sure of anything.<eos> Hey, everyone, Bishop and I are dating.<eos> All right?<eos> That's right. We are rubbing butts and we don't care who knows it.<eos> So... You two are hooking up.
We put our hands together and we agreed that this was the best arrangement for the country under reconstruction.<eos> The presidency, here, in St. Louis with the Chief of Staff and my Secretary of Foreign Affairs chosen from your regions.<eos> Senator Beatty with the constitutional authority to ratify certain new laws, and I thank you for that... and an expectation that all of you would try to maintain control over your regions until we sorted out how the boundaries could be drawn<eos> or whether or not we needed to elect new governors.<eos> Now, we've got congressional elections coming up next month, after which the people, through the voice of the new Congress, can decide whether or not to retain my policies.<eos> Until then, I say this...<eos> get a handle on your people.<eos> If you can't and you really fear rioting,<eos> I will not hesitate to use the full force of our armed forces to maintain order in this country.<eos> Now, I have a job to do, and so do you.
- Aye, sir.<eos> Approaching the first set now, sir.<eos> Port side.<eos> Five degrees starboard!<eos> Come to 0-2-1-2.<eos> The next group is right...<eos> There!<eos> That was close.<eos> Two more sets.<eos> Cruz and Wolf, you're up.
I would.<eos> - That's what we did.<eos> - Well, I need a proper meal.<eos> Alba, how's my chicken coming on?<eos> Oh, think he's fine.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Get in that oven at once!<eos> Why is no-one doing what I say?<eos> I'm the bloody master of this house!<eos> And I demand that you dirty shirkers get up and get back to work now!
Hey!<eos> Aurelius!<eos> - That's the end of the wine.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Well, do let me know if there's anything else you want.<eos> - One of my kidneys maybe.<eos> - Can you get me some olive oil?<eos> - I said I'd give Delph a massage.<eos> - Mm, yeah, that'd be amazing.<eos> Er, yeah, but what do I do? While you're doing this.
Man, I know you hear me talking to you, man,<eos> - I'm speaking English.<eos> - All right, cool. Let's just keep it cool, okay, guys?<eos> Nigga, if you don't get out of my face....<eos> Worldstar!<eos> - No, don't do that to us.<eos> - No, no, no, no no. I think I'm being more than fair, calmly asking for compensation.<eos> So let's go, bro.<eos> No, y'all staying broke tonight.<eos> Well, you trying to get in the club before 10:45, which means you trying to get in before 11:00, which means you also broke.
I'd just appreciate a little bit of courtesy, that's all.<eos> Is that so difficult?<eos> You're just very truculent.<eos> That's not even a word.<eos> Hostile, and... antagonistic.<eos> Hooten!<eos> - Put me down!<eos> - No!<eos> I am not... antagonistic.<eos> OK, gentlemen, I'll take the chopper and you follow the river, south!
I... am a man of vision.<eos> A man who sees the past is the architect of his own future.<eos> Legend has it, that the great Saba left treasure of her people in the desert.<eos> She carved a map into the bowl and spoon from which she was served her final meal.<eos> You do know that's just a myth?<eos> It's a myth to people like you, who need to see with their own eyes before they'll believe.<eos> Because you... have no heart.<eos> No faith in anything.<eos> I know it is real, and that is enough.<eos> Now, you will solve the final riddle of the grest Saba.
Nobody can.<eos> Aah!<eos> Ah!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't forget about me.<eos> Agh!<eos> Ooh!<eos> Arr-arr!<eos> You two should spend some time apart.
Well, why would I shoot at a human target?<eos> I mean, that's weird, right?<eos> I mean, look at that one.<eos> That's just way too specific, man. I don't care.<eos> I...<eos> I'm not gonna let you shoot a fucking dog in here.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - But...<eos> He can shoot whatever he wants.<eos> You shoot at your racist targets with no problem.
I don't care about you!<eos> No one does!<eos> They pity you!<eos> And he doesn't even remember you to care.<eos> So how much will it take to make you leave?<eos> Tell me and I will give you a check...<eos> SARAH: Stop it, Olivia!<eos> This is cruel.<eos> You have no idea the accommodations I have made to see James happy.<eos> And you two are jeopardizing everything!
Did either of you arrange for someone to represent Jack?<eos> We'd have said if we had.<eos> I just assumed.<eos> No. (SIGHS)<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. It's all a mix-up.<eos> - Carolyn. - (DIAL TONE)<eos> Hello?<eos> You're desperately clinging to the tatters of a case because you're too stubborn to admit you've rushed in like bulls at a gate.<eos> (HAND THUDS) Now, you have proof that my client was in this hospital when that poor girl was being butchered in the city.
Hello?<eos> You're desperately clinging to the tatters of a case because you're too stubborn to admit you've rushed in like bulls at a gate.<eos> (HAND THUDS) Now, you have proof that my client was in this hospital when that poor girl was being butchered in the city.<eos> All he did was try to save her life when she arrived.<eos> Yes, he falsified the cause of death, but in response to the pleas from her distraught mother.<eos> Now, if I stick her on the stand, the whole jury will think Dr. Jack a hero.<eos> And when we're done, we will go for compensation... for harassment, damage to reputation, loss of peace of mind.<eos> I'm on a tight schedule, gentlemen.<eos> Let's call it quits and we can all go home.<eos> You've restored my faith in the system, gentlemen.
Why not?<eos> Are you sure your health permits this?<eos> If I'm not up to a few accounts, George, what good am I?<eos> OLIVIA: Please.<eos> Anna, wait!<eos> When is this family going to stop lying? !<eos> I had to tell her.<eos> It's so wrong, keeping this from James!<eos> She was going to talk to him about their employing Harry.<eos> If you're not going to tell him, I am. Anna...
I'm so glad you saw my argument, Henry.<eos> It's a drug that needs vigilance, but it's pointless him suffering.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Have you found someone to look after the farm while you're away?<eos> Mr. Briggs has an excellent young man.<eos> His name's Harry Polson.<eos> You should look into that.<eos> It's so wrong, keeping this from James!<eos> She was going to talk to him about their employing Harry.<eos> If you're not going to tell him, I am.
CAROLYN: What's this?<eos> It's from Douglas.<eos> I'm so sorry to disturb you on your honeymoon. I just don't want to talk to Lizzie about this.<eos> No. No problem at all.<eos> Uh, after you left this morning, I telephoned some other loyal patrons,<eos> Donald and Audrey Eggleton.<eos> Point Piper.<eos> Sir Richard Bennett has been in their ear.<eos> Apparently I'm... I'm supposed to have some sort of open checkbook with Elizabeth, and any other donations are surplus to requirements.<eos> I-I just thought, seeing as he's a family friend, you might know what to make of it.
You and I are rather similar types in that regard, wouldn't you say?<eos> Well, yes. (CHUCKLES) I think indeed we are.<eos> Which is why I feel that I can tell you the truth in relation to Mr. Briggs.<eos> Now, please don't get me wrong. He is a good man.<eos> But he is... a man.<eos> And they are so very prone to bumbling, are they not?<eos> Oh, yes, I suppose they are.<eos> I believe that he confided in you that he was intending to court a lady.<eos> Uh, yes. Yes. Yes, he did.<eos> Well, he could do that because you and he are such friends... such solid... platonic friends.
Something's afoot.<eos> Thank you for making the effort with Regina.<eos> Oh, courtesy costs little, especially given that I'll soon be gone.<eos> We're finally taking that Middle Eastern trip.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> We'll reside in Sydney when we return.<eos> We're marrying overseas.<eos> The usual malarkey's more of an embarrassment at our age than anything else.<eos> Unless you'd be too disappointed.<eos> Whatever you see fit.
Yeah, you remember me?<eos> You didn't have a light.<eos> I got two words for you... bugger off.<eos> Whatever you got, we don't want any.<eos> Go inside.<eos> - My name's Gordon Walsh.<eos> - Stay right there!<eos> Milly Davis' fiancé.<eos> I just want to know who killed her.<eos> I think you might have a pretty good idea.
Let go of the hanger!<eos> Huh?<eos> Let go!<eos> This calls for an investigation.<eos> All right.<eos> Stand back!<eos> Follow me, fellas!<eos> Watch your heads.<eos> Holy moly!<eos> Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell?
- Like all whores.<eos> I will tell you...<eos> Go on.<eos> That's all you paid for.<eos> Welcome to Baler... sir.<eos> The rebels belong to a Masonic organization, the Katipunan, that seeks an independent Philippines.<eos> They don't care that Spain has been here for 400 years, that we've built its cities. They want us out, and dead.<eos> The Tagalog are tough, they're very violent, and they have great allies:<eos> the heat, malaria, typhoons and beasts.<eos> You're very young, very green, and inept
Let's go, hurry!<eos> Fire!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Take cover! Get down!<eos> What do we do?<eos> - The cannon's out of range.<eos> - Then what?<eos> Fire!<eos> "You see the attacks the Devil and the world make everywhere on the faith, in which, to gain eternal glory, we desire, by the grace of God to live and die.<eos> You, the aid of Christians, renew, for your sons' salvation, the ancient victories..."
- He's lying!<eos> We don't know that!<eos> If the Field Marshal sent him, he would've come on a Spanish patrol boat and not alone.<eos> If this document is true, we've been fighting for almost a year for the hell of it.<eos> Nobody's fighting for the hell of it!<eos> We're defending ourselves from men firing a cannon at us!<eos> You've lost your last chance to get out alive, Spaniards.<eos> Your last chance!<eos> You've been shut in there for a year while Spain is laughing at you!<eos> You're not going to die for Spain!
They take Apple Pay.<eos> You just have to put your thumb on the thing.<eos> They don't want me to succeed.<eos> Oh, no, Jimmy, before you turn, can you just put your thumb on the thing? !<eos> - Look at them.<eos> - No!<eos> Sirens singing, "Come play with us." But really they just want me to pilot my literary schooner into the rocks of do-nothingness.<eos> - I invited them!<eos> - Exactly!<eos> If you all didn't want me to fail, then you would've listened when I said I have to write!
- He's gonna say yes.<eos> - He's gonna say yes.<eos> Hey, nobody said this shit was gonna be easy, dawg.<eos> - Hey! Hey!<eos> He's gonna say yes. - He's gonna say yes.<eos> All right!<eos> He's gonna say yes.<eos> Hey, guys, Mr. Blush is ready for you.<eos> He's gonna say yes, baby.<eos> Me, I don't know anything about tech or computers or apps or what have you, but my consultant was very impressed with your code, Izzy.
Thank goodness. Boy, last year, - that was a-a nasal assault.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Also, we are co-hosting the "Pancake Pig-out"<eos> with Moffat Lutheran.<eos> You're welcome to join us later.<eos> We're meeting the Moff-Lu rep on-site to discuss griddles.<eos> But the big news is, and this was all Dora's doing, - by the way... - No.<eos> This year's livestock blessing will be given by Ladner Trinity's very own Pastor Buddy Barlow.<eos> Well, that is a coup.<eos> I must admit, you two make an adequate team.
You're a pathetic little bully.<eos> And too cared to face the truth about himself, that your wife chose the better man!<eos> - Just shut up!<eos> - He'll always have beaten you, and you know it.<eos> And that's what make you so inadequate.<eos> Just shut up!<eos> Finally.<eos> Hooten.<eos> The jewel is down there with those snakes.<eos> You'll be our guest.
But that is not a cool thing for teammates to do.<eos> Jacob, is your seat belt on?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ! Are you okay?<eos> You know, the thing about baseball. Is that it's a game, it's not a sport.<eos> You need a sport.<eos> Do you know what is a sport?<eos> Soccer.<eos> Don't you call it "futbol"?
So let's do a checklist. Hammer!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Check.<eos> - Nails! - Yeah.<eos> - Check.<eos> That's the end of the checklist.<eos> Wait, a hammer?<eos> How come we can't use a nail gun?<eos> That seems way faster.<eos> Well, I'm not letting you two idiots mess with a nail gun.
Hey.<eos> And then you get to it immediately.<eos> After some pretty standard bouncing, you realise... ..he's edging towards your arsehole.<eos> But you're drunk and he made the effort to come all the way here, so you let him.<eos> He's thrilled.<eos> I'm so thrilled.<eos> And then the next morning, you wake to find him... fully dressed, sat on the side of the bed, gazing at you.<eos> He says that...<eos> Last night was incredible.<eos> Which you think is an overstatement, but then he goes on to say that...
What kind of experiment?<eos> We were drugged, put into pods that linked our minds.<eos> The experiment was designed to see if the collective human consciousness could solve problems better than computers.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Originally, it was a corporation called Electus.<eos> Originally?<eos> Hey.<eos> Several years ago, a group of us rose up.<eos> We killed the Electus crew, took the ship.<eos> I don't get it... if you took the ship...
Trust me.<eos> Give me a channel to the Seer ship.<eos> Very well.<eos> Channel open.<eos> This is the "Raza." Our shields are down.<eos> If you hit us with another shot, you will destroy us.<eos> Turn over the cargo you stole from us.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm told you already know what's gonna happen, but just in case, let me lay it out for you.<eos> We're gonna keep this bit of cargo, and you're gonna let us go.
Listen, Joe, we like you.<eos> You believed in the network.<eos> Hell, you walked away from your own company when your board voted against us.<eos> But Ryan... let's face it, Ryan doesn't sound like a guy who's gonna keep his mouth shut.<eos> His next call could be to my boss.<eos> Ryan would never do that.<eos> Well, regardless, we can't work with someone who's being investigated for computer fraud, who blatantly violated major legislation that went into effect this year.<eos> Joe didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I'm not saying he did.<eos> But until we find the person who is responsible, you two need to stay away from each other.
Yeah, maybe I should go to the store and just... make sure that we have everything we need.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You want me to go with you?<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> Okay.<eos> "I, Ryan Ray, released the MacMillan Utility source code.<eos> I acted alone.<eos> No one helped me, and no one told me to do it.<eos> I did this because 'security' is a myth.<eos> Contrary to what you might have heard, my friends, you are not safe.
Excellent attitude.<eos> Well, you're in the right place.<eos> And this weekend is about being mindful.<eos> It's about leaving your voice in your head... ..and trapping your thoughts in your skull.<eos> Think of it as a thought prison in your mind.<eos> Firstly, we're going to teach you how to breathe.<eos> Then we will have a short meditation, then we will find our sanctuary in the partaking of menial tasks, all in perfect silence.<eos> Principal rules are no talking.<eos> If you need to communicate with any of our other superiors, you can write on that board.<eos> Under no other circumstances must you communicate, even with each other.
Stop!<eos> How did you get so strong? (Molly giggling)<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> So do you still love me?<eos> Even though I know your weakness?<eos> There's nothing that could stop me loving you, Mol.<eos> You and Molly?<eos> - No, no there's no more. - Have you got more?<eos> GRACE:<eos> You were together?
Windows blacked out.<eos> Chimney smoke.<eos> Someone's home.<eos> Lennard, you use the boomer.<eos> Okay, Mass check.<eos> Everyone got the layout? - Check.<eos> - Check.<eos> Check.<eos> Aikin, Valcon, Coach, you check the outbuildings here. Take them one at a time and slow.<eos> Stripe, Raiman, you come with me and Lennard.

Take them one at a time and slow.<eos> Stripe, Raiman, you come with me and Lennard.<eos> We go in here.<eos> Len and I will talk to Heidekker, you check the rest of the house. Okay.
It's just precautionary, and it's only for one night.<eos> Just gotta call in.<eos> Hi.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Hopefully never.<eos> Granular are onto it.<eos> Understood.<eos> They housed a witness here for a while, Shaun said.<eos> - Must've had kids.<eos> - Have you got kids?
Let's get warmed up at my club.<eos> It's like I've accepted, Mico.<eos> No, without "like".<eos> Gaetano, here.<eos> I know I'm part of a system that's bigger than me, but I want to say one thing.<eos> These guys are the worst pigs in the world.<eos> I feel a thousand times more honest than all of them.<eos> When they speak, it makes me vomit.<eos> "The Mother", the Federation, meet that guy, speak to the other guy, ask for approval from yet another...<eos> But Mico Rende made his own way in this shitty country, in this fuckin' cold, and you know it.
We have one guest speaker.<eos> And tonight she's gonna speak about being a mom - and having a career.<eos> - Nobody cares.<eos> Please welcome our very own Sam Fox.<eos> Yeah, Mom!<eos> Go, Mom!<eos> Thank you, Patty.<eos> Um, well... I work and I am a mom.<eos> And some of you might later in life find yourselves in the same situation, I hope.<eos> Because you girls can be anything you want.
No.<eos> - Poor bloke.<eos> He must have felt awful.<eos> - I hope he's okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Arnold, what's your brother up tonight?<eos> Why would I know that?<eos> Nothing, probably, or drinking or pretending to be a lesbian on Tinder to trick lesbians into talking sex with him.<eos> No, it would be really good to get him to meet Alan and May before he shoots off.<eos> Alan, you and Steve, you would hit it off.
Hannah, I feel like you and I have a lot in common.<eos> Ugh, I feel like that's an insult for both of us.<eos> I agree.<eos> Tom, how could you in any way think that's a compliment?<eos> Bully!<eos> Bully!<eos> Hannah, I think that you are fantastic and hilarious, and I think you're a really good friend to Rose, and you're beautiful.<eos> I think you say things you don't mean to make people like you.<eos> That is such a good insult.<eos> Oh, my God, do you think someone died?
I don't think that boy was a bully, Peaches. I think he was in love with you.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Why are you so desperate to have been bullied?<eos> It's okay to have not been bullied.<eos> - Mae bullies me.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Oh, Mae's not a bully.<eos> - Okay, she's not. I just wanted to say that.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Are you two all right?
And then have... why?<eos> I don't know, he's busy.<eos> Yeah, I see his Snapchat sometimes, and he looks... he looks busy.<eos> Wait, are you... are you still seeing him?<eos> We have a daughter.<eos> - I mean, I still go out, but...<eos> - Is he living with you?<eos> When he can afford to, yes.<eos> Y'all are funny.<eos> You two are funny.
You can just call me America's Golden Eagle.<eos> - Well, America's... Golden Eagle.<eos> - Ew. - I just mainly fly the zeppelin. - Mmm.<eos> Actually, I should probably get back to the controls.<eos> Nonsense, you're my guest, it's an honor.<eos> For more information, check out my lifestyle website.<eos> Engorge.biz.<eos> Oh, my God, what's going on?<eos> Nobody's flying the zeppelin, you idiot!<eos> You have to go down with the ship because you're in the band, and it's Titanic!
That's the least of my regrets.<eos> Demelza... ..I would never deliberately hurt you.<eos> You of all people must know that.<eos> Must I, Ross?<eos> So I'm to assume you inflict pain by accident without a second thought?<eos> In the moment, I admit it, there was no thought of you, or of the pain I might have caused...<eos> It was as if I was possessed.<eos> Of course.<eos> No fault of yours!<eos> Just a greater power and you and her helpless to resist.
For a month.<eos> Give her these powders.<eos> I'll call again tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tonkin.<eos> Captain!<eos> It's good to see you at liberty, sir.<eos> I'll not forget your kindness.<eos> When hard times come, many friends fall away.<eos> You did not.
Mr Warleggan will have 'ee hanged if he see thee here again.<eos> Is... is that wise?<eos> A man who owns land has the right to enclose it.<eos> But to use force needlessly is to court enemies.<eos> Are you becoming squeamish?<eos> I merely question the virtue of provoking one's neighbours, great or small.<eos> You're sure it was on Warleggan orders?<eos> Look at Jory. Look at Dan.<eos> Do you not recognise the handiwork?<eos> You also tried to cross at Trenwith Land?
This is the sugar sickness.<eos> The symptoms are unmistakable.<eos> What must I do?<eos> Give up most of the things you eat and drink.<eos> Wine, especially. And that'll cure me, will it?<eos> No.<eos> But it may prolong your life.<eos> Will my life be worth living? It hardly sounds like it!<eos> Dr Enys?<eos> You and I did not part as friends, so I'm all the more obliged to you for coming.
My dear, the sale of Geoffrey Charles's shares in Wheal Grace.<eos> We fear it might have been fraudulent.<eos> Do you recall Ross mentioning any new shareholders?<eos> You must know I've had no dealings with Ross since before our marriage.<eos> Of course, my dear.<eos> Do not distress yourself.<eos> Leave me to deal with the matter.<eos> "Dear Poldark, as you are a trustee of Francis's estate, perhaps"<eos> "you might shed light on certain recent transactions which" "appear troubling."<eos> "Dear Warleggan, as you are not a trustee of Francis's estate," "I do not consider the business in any way concerns you."
We have to go in full force.<eos> Keep in mind... bringing him back won't be a popular decision.<eos> But since when do we care about being popular, huh?<eos> Colonel Carrillo.<eos> Yes, Mr. President.<eos> Boss, they're all saying they don't know anything.<eos> There seems to be a misunderstanding.<eos> You gentlemen are under the impression that you work for the Moncadas.<eos> Allow me to clarify.<eos> You have never worked for the Moncadas.

- Jairo.<eos> - Yes, Don Pablo.<eos> The money that puts food on the table for these men, where does it come from?<eos> - From your pocket.<eos> - Everything you see here is mine.<eos> Everything you have is because I allow you to have it.<eos> Everything you think you are protecting, you are protecting for me.<eos> Are we clear on this?<eos> You're going to tell me the location of every safe house, every lab, every office, every account of the Moncadas.<eos> And look... that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.
He said they were going to send a message to other kids.<eos> Who is "he"?<eos> Do you remember his name?<eos> Colonel Carrillo.<eos> Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.<eos> - Where are you taking us?<eos> - Bogotá.<eos> You're going to jail until this gets resolved.<eos> But look...<eos> if you help me, I can help you.
You got it.<eos> -This was recorded about five minutes ago.<eos> -You can barely hear it.<eos> Let me clean it up.<eos> All right.<eos> Now turn off the satellite phones.<eos> -That's Pablo.<eos> -We have to move now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You two are staying here.
Son of a bitch.<eos> We should call for backup, right?<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> - What's going on, Peña?<eos> - I'll handle this.<eos> This is Trujillo.<eos> You can trust him.<eos> You're finally seeing the light.<eos> Let's just see if this works.<eos> You two coming?
We have the rabbit ear, we go around the tree, and...?<eos> And it goes in the hole.<eos> --That was a loud one.<eos> You threaten a man's family, and you find out what he's made of.<eos> Pablo Escobar was made of rage, revenge and terror.<eos> Unable to lash out directly at his enemies in Cali, he went after their prized legitimate business, their beloved chain of drugstores.<eos> And he blew them to shit along with anyone unlucky enough to be standing nearby.<eos> We're talking dozens of bombs.<eos> He put the city of Bogotá on edge and the Colombian government on notice.<eos> Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.
How so?<eos> I know that you want Escobar dead.<eos> And while I don't agree with that, I understand it.<eos> But this... this I can't understand.<eos> This isn't just wrong. It puts you, the president of Colombia, in league with a death squad.<eos> Call the German chancellor.<eos> Tell him to let the family in.<eos> I'm sorry to inform you, your entry into Germany has been denied.<eos> I know my rights, sir.<eos> But you don't understand.
I called many times.<eos> Many times.<eos> I called everyone in Miami.<eos> There's no trace of the Lion.<eos> Pablo!<eos> Tata?<eos> Pablo, they killed her. They dumped her in front of the hotel.<eos> Who?<eos> Valeria.<eos> Are you all okay?
- Fine, then a jail cell here.<eos> With a sign that says "snitch" around your neck.<eos> The narcos always talk about loyalty... till their own asses are on the line.<eos> Quica.<eos> Hello.<eos> Where are you, boss?<eos> I'm en route, and you?<eos> Me too. I'm not too far off.<eos> I'm almost there, boss.<eos> Are you still far off?
That you would forgive us.<eos> And that you might help us get out of the country.<eos> How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?<eos> In property?<eos> In cash?<eos> I can find out.<eos> That's good.<eos> Because I want all of it.<eos> Sir, do I need a lawyer?<eos> You're the review board, right?
RICHARD:<eos> Here he comes. He's firing noises.<eos> There it is.<eos> Look at that.<eos> JEREMY:<eos> Finally, it was the turn of the psycho killer.<eos> The trickiest, the edgiest of the three.<eos> But I was so confident it'd win,<eos> I was prepared to take a massive gamble.<eos> If the McLaren isn't the fastest, you two can knock my house down.
That's capitalism.<eos> Salvatore's right.<eos> We made an agreement, agreements have to be respected.<eos> And this priest thing too... We can't go against the Church!<eos> - Everything's okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Take care.<eos> Ciro, whose side are you on?<eos> Our side.<eos> You don't get his game, do you?
You're the only woman in my life.<eos> That's not true, I know you're seeing a girl from the "Blue houses".<eos> How do you know that?<eos> People like to talk. And so?<eos> You won't be celebrating your birthday alone this year.<eos> When can I meet her?<eos> When I'm sure it's serious.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Father Alfonso, you've given a signal of strength and courage, you've shown that change is possible, will there be more demonstrations?
And why?<eos> What did you do wrong?<eos> You made fun of a fucking faggot.<eos> You, Gabriele?<eos> No one can cut cocaine better than you.<eos> But we work and he makes the money.<eos> And he says we're free.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I bought my freedom with blood.<eos> What do you want to do?
If you want her that badly, that's where you'll find her.<eos> Oh, I'll find her, all right.<eos> Sooner or later.<eos> But what happens to her after I find her is entirely up to you.<eos> She was party to the destruction on iriden-3.<eos> She'll be facing multiple life sentences, at the least.<eos> Execution would also be on the table.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You're thinking that if you tell the truth about what happened that day, you'll be implicating yourself and your crew.<eos> But given the litany of offenses you already face, it won't make a difference in the long run.
Mom, I'm in a group chat.<eos> It's a big thing, and there's, like, a potentially bullying thing.<eos> Dakota is just having the worst...<eos> Mom, don't!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can we use your salt? - What?<eos> - Hi.<eos> You're so cute.<eos> You two don't know each other very well, do you?
But, I mean, give you a second, I have heard nothing about you.<eos> Mom, that...<eos> - Is that your daughter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. I'm so sorry she's bothering you.<eos> Mom, I'll talk to you now.<eos> She's not bothering me.<eos> Oh, he's coming back.<eos> You know what?<eos> You should sit over there, because you both don't listen, and I will sit here with your lovely date, who you don't notice.
I have a way of cooking chicken that makes the meat fall off the bones.<eos> Hi, guys. Hi.<eos> Um, I was wondering...<eos> I just need two guys.<eos> Two to do a little bit of work.<eos> You know, for maybe, like, 50 bucks or something.<eos> Two of you guys?<eos> All right, great.<eos> How are you?<eos> No, no, no, you can, uh, follow me.
He's been linked to Intergang, Kasnian terrorists, and the genocide in Corto Maltese.<eos> If you want somebody high-profile killed, this is the guy to hire.<eos> But who would want Lena Luthor dead?<eos> Hey, where's Kara?<eos> Trying to talk Lena out of going through with the renaming ceremony.<eos> Sound likes she's just as stubborn as her brother.<eos> I'll have Agent Danvers on hand.<eos> This Corben doesn't seem like he cares who gets hurt so long as he gets his target.<eos> Kara and I will be there, too.<eos> Don't you think you two should talk?
Agent Rask?<eos> Special Agent Madeline Pierce.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Today's all about Andrew Talman.<eos> - So, who gave you that money?<eos> - My dad!<eos> He launders money through his bank.<eos> I swore I would never be that person.<eos> I was this close to losing you today.<eos> You kill one of us, we gonna kill 10 of y'all!
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Bell. Hi.<eos> - Sorry, now is not a good time.<eos> You guys going up to RadCoin, meeting Maya Hibert?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't know me, although you should, so I'm gonna give you one of these.<eos> What you're about to hear up there is bullshit.<eos> RadCoin is bullshit.<eos> It's a gimmick.<eos> This right here is the real deal.<eos> It's the future of currency, but I'll let you decide for yourself.

Yeah. There' so many people out there are hurting.<eos> Half of these people don't even have access to personal banking.<eos> Alex: I totally get it.<eos> You know, new currency based in a self-evolving source code.<eos> Human-proof, future-proof.<eos> - If your code works... - It works.<eos> - ...then it's all pretty genius.<eos> - Yeah, it definitely works. I had it audited myself before I signed her.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it does.<eos> And unlike RadCoin, what you're proposing is,
You're a laughingstock, Charles.<eos> Oh, oh, it's awful.<eos> This show isn't good enough. No show could be good enough.<eos> It's not?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Da-da-do-doo! Getting ready for Monday.<eos> I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,<eos> Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea, and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny when he walks in.<eos> Arnold Palmer Lenny.<eos> You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.
They'll make a mistake, and everyone on that station will die.<eos> Look at this from my point of view.<eos> This is not exactly the kind of story I can take to the board.<eos> So keep it between us.<eos> And if I bring you in on this without authorization, well, I'll be risking my career.<eos> You get on that station without us you'll risk losing a whole hell of a lot more than that.<eos> Tell me everything's fine...<eos> That there's no risk of a corporate war, and we'll get back on our ship, go on our merry way, and you'll never have to see us again.<eos> All right.<eos> There may be a level of tension within the Council that goes beyond what the public is aware, and yes, if this blink drive works the way you say it does you may well be in a unique position to help.
They'll have you destroyed.<eos> Besides...<eos> I owe you one.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You're with Mikkei.<eos> You could use this information to your advantage.<eos> Yeah, I'm not surprised you would think that.<eos> All I can tell you is we're not all like Nieman.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Well, don't you three look very corporate?
- Exactly.<eos> You, on the other hand, are a traitor who turned his back on his own to help a bunch of criminals escape justice.<eos> They were going to be murdered before they ever got to trial.<eos> That's not justice.<eos> - What does Ishida have planned?<eos> - Ishida?<eos> He's got nothing to do with this.<eos> So it's just a coincidence that the two of you are here together at the same time?<eos> I didn't even know he was going to be here.<eos> - You work together.
Looks made for you!<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I knew Patrizia would find the right one.<eos> Like to try it on in case it needs altering?<eos> If I'd wanted to strip, you wouldn't be wearing it... would you?<eos> I shouldn't ask you to model her clothes, but your friend's mother-in-law's a bitch.<eos> It's for a special occasion?<eos> You're beautiful as it is, but in this... a panther!
We have to make eggplant parmesan for Lelluccio, you forgot?<eos> - No.<eos> - Get moving!<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye, ma'am!<eos> Bye, Patrizia!<eos> Bye, Marinella.<eos> Your friend's good.<eos> How can I, Lady Annalisa?<eos> You don't want me to work.
Don Pietro, if I may...<eos> Are you sure it's the only solution?<eos> I need to look in his eyes, he's gotta say why that rat Ciro is still around.<eos> You know what's right.
Don't leave that alley, understand?<eos> We can't risk our necks because of you.<eos> Hey, hands off!<eos> What do you want?<eos> What's this, asshole?<eos> We're starving in the alley, this gets us by.<eos> You buy your stuff just from us!<eos> - 48 a kilo's too much!<eos> - That's the price!<eos> Screw you, others sell at 30, how come you're selling at 48?
Who is it?<eos> - Linx!<eos> - Hi, Bomber!<eos> What's up, guys?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Don't move, asshole!<eos> Come here, you piece of shit!<eos> You'd already be dead if it was up to me.<eos> Think I forgot you shot outside my house?<eos> But there's a deal now, and Don Pietro said we have to respect it, and so do you, okay?
-Previously on "Shut Eye"...<eos> -I'm back, bitches.<eos> -She was supposed to leave town.<eos> - What the fuck are you doing here?
Change it.<eos> Change it all!<eos> Fucking caterers.<eos> And, of course, my husband had to go and add your little performance.<eos> This thing gonna work?<eos> - I really hope so.<eos> - My husband's the best in the business.<eos> -He'd better be.<eos> And remember, this is our wedding.<eos> You're the help.
Good Lord, it's hot out here.<eos> We need to move this war, Bob Lee.<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> This is Raider Six Seven, Raider Six Seven.<eos> Cowboy Alpha approaching village to Delta, over.<eos> Raider One Three Actual, this is Raider One Three Bravo We have eyes on the supply convoy.<eos> Town is clear at this time.<eos> Continuing to observe, over<eos> Roger that, One Three Bravo.<eos> You watch over them and I'll watch over you.
- Surprise, you read my file.<eos> - Of course I have, and it tells me that deep down, you wanna make a difference over here.<eos> Now, I'm a thousand choices from being a true believer, but I know... I know what it takes to save American lives.<eos> I'm asking if you do.<eos> Ladies, quit your knitting.<eos> There's been a change of plans.<eos> Swagger and Fenn, I need you to get on top of this grain storage facility outside the village.<eos> Neeman and Walker, convoy security.<eos> Everything else, including our objective, remains the same.<eos> You two should get going.
But these guys have a van-load of bad shit, and they're planning on using it.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> So why don't you untie me and let me help?<eos> Oh, sorry, Captain.<eos> Call me crazy, but I don't trust you.<eos> Hopefully Richards isn't as good a shot as he thinks he is, but I've been wrong about people before.<eos> All right. Let's do this.<eos> You ready, or you need some time to catch your breath from that little walk?<eos> On scope, range is exactly 1,625 yards.<eos> You Navy boys always could hum.
Hello, Jackson.<eos> She could've complicated things.<eos> Just find Campbell.<eos> Triple-Helix animals, environmental anomalies, genomic fossils.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> You want me to explain it using smaller words?<eos> That research will lead us to a cure.<eos> When are you going to accept the fact that there is no cure?<eos> You found your cure once and it failed.<eos> You failed.
Grab the blanket.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get the freezer.<eos> Anybody want a cold one?<eos> I'll wager that's the first time since this started that an animal actually saved someone's life.<eos> Keep your mouth shut.<eos> Seriously, how many people do the animals have to kill before you wake up?
That meeting Jackson in Uwei as a young man wasn't a coincidence.<eos> That you knew Robert Oz long before you met his son.<eos> Robert told you that?<eos> Actually, you just did.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Did he say anything about Jackson's dad?<eos> He doesn't know anything.<eos> You are going to leave this plane without what you came for.<eos> Sounds like something you should worry about, not me.
I want to speak to my father.<eos> Run a trace.<eos> What makes you think I can do that?<eos> Jerk me around again, and I hang up.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I can help you. Tell me the real reason you came after me in Portugal.<eos> Now.<eos> Your father has something I need.<eos> And he won't give it to me unless he sees you.<eos> I'm willing to turn myself in, but I need proof that you've got him.
That is what I was going to ask you.<eos> Everything you said lined up with a Noah Objective scientist we spoke with two days ago.<eos> His name is Dr. Robert Oz.<eos> It is a scary thing to realize the mutation has jumped to humans.<eos> I must convince the Cabinet of Ministers.<eos> They're meeting in Washington in two days.<eos> I need you to come with me to the embassy and convince the Minister of Defense that we're close to a cure.<eos> Your father has something I need.<eos> And he won't give it to me unless he sees you.<eos> I'm willing to turn myself in, but I need proof that you've got him.
Don't thank me. Just convince my cabinet that your cure is our only option.<eos> That's exactly what we'll do.<eos> Not "we." You won't be attending, Ms. Shaw.<eos> You're a high-ranking U.S. government official.<eos> It cannot appear as though we are pushing the U.S. agenda.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will meet with you both after the vote is called.<eos> Good luck.<eos> These are the people who are going to make so you can ride a real horse again.<eos> You are going to fix the animals?
Nietzsche.<eos> Now, that you remember.<eos> We got to get these doors open.<eos> Just in case we can't, have I thanked you lately for dragging me into this adventure?<eos> Come to think of it, no.<eos> - Thank you. - Been a real treat.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - You know, I could've waited out the animal apocalypse from the comfort of my couch.<eos> But where's the fun in that?<eos> You two should get bigger room!
That's Maharishi Makkar.<eos> James gave him a six-month residency here.<eos> I haven't introduced myself. uh...<eos> Doc...<eos> Dr. Channarayapatra.<eos> Out of Johns Hopkins, neurosurgery.<eos> I like to keep tabs on the best and the brightest.<eos> Coming from you, Dr. Wallace, I am flattered.<eos> So do you think it's possible, what James is trying to do?<eos> What you're all trying to do?
- Hairless wonder.<eos> - Ohh, you did it again. - Again.<eos> - Yep, I did it. - You did it again.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Am I?<eos> Yeah, 'cause you're like 10 times more resilient than me, and I'm okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, hey, Doc.<eos> How fast can you get blood-alcohol in our victim?<eos> I'm thinking she's wasted, walking and texting, misses a step and bled out is my guess, but, you know, that's just a guess until you two work your magic.
No.<eos> Never.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Now, one last thing.<eos> We just need to know your whereabouts - on last night that...<eos> - I could check his schedule to see...<eos> Nobody needs to check his schedule.<eos> He was at home, with me.<eos> A young girl lost her life.<eos> You're telling me it was murder,
Yeah, that's me. I'm Lane.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - We know what Lane looks like.<eos> Lady, you don't know what you know.<eos> You're standing in front of a picture of him.<eos> Well, Lane's super busy, so...<eos> Cassie Hanson was murdered, and do you realize you're talking to a cop?<eos> You got to be smarter, my man.<eos> See, I'm not your man, bro.<eos> I'm Epsilon, and you're in our house.
Today's the day she...<eos> Today's her day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Guys, follow me.<eos> Commander Rosendahl?<eos> Oh... um, I'm sorry to bother you, but it... it's urgent.<eos> Yes?<eos> Um... This man is working as one of your ground crew, and it's very important we find him quickly.<eos> He's a threat to your base, sir. How?<eos> Who are you?
It's not going to really change anything.<eos> Our institutions are too established, but in the past, things were a lot more fragile.<eos> I...<eos> I think Flynn is trying to kill America in the crib.<eos> Rewrite history before it's even written.<eos> None of you are to say a word about any of this, under penalty of treason.<eos> If we need you, we'll call you.<eos> - Wait. - Need us?<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> Flynn is still out there. He still has the mother ship. And you are still our best option.
- We love your show.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Do you want to dance? Uh-uh.<eos> No.<eos> But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, Big Three, do you three know how much I love your mother?
Please.<eos> So the sex was consensual?<eos> I told you, we never had sex.<eos> It was neither consensual nor nonconsensual. It never happened.<eos> I would never do that to Luka.<eos> Right, 'cause you're such a gentleman. - And you're a liar.<eos> - The hell you talking about?<eos> We ran Ali's DNA.<eos> Ana's the mother.<eos> So, unless you had in vitro, you two had sex.
I could have rented a helicopter for that.<eos> It was New Year's Eve.<eos> You have to understand how surge pricing works.<eos> I'm calling one.<eos> Shit!<eos> Andy must be using our account.<eos> You keep the car so clean.<eos> Smooth on the brake.<eos> You're... oh, uh, so sorry. It's the wife.<eos> You two would love each other. Maybe double date next week.
Just say yes.<eos> 1-800-crypt-keeper.<eos> How may I direct your call?<eos> Yes, hi, I'd like to be connected to your Alzheimer's department?<eos> Why did I divorce Graham again?<eos> Is this a trick question?<eos> I give up.<eos> I seriously can't remember, and he's taking me out to dinner, and I need to be armed.<eos> I can't backslide again.<eos> Okay, you know I always liked Graham, but you two were a disaster together.
They should call my boy the Lumberjack the way he's chopping down all that wood.<eos> Or Working Girl, the way he works those balls so nice and sweet.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's stick with lumberjack.<eos> Timber!<eos> What's wrong with Steve?<eos> He looks bummed.<eos> Maybe I'm not bringing it hard enough.<eos> Come on, let's get it going for Steve!<eos> I say, "Lumber," you say, "Jack!"
Why so surprised?<eos> The camp hasn't been open in six years.<eos> They had to put it somewhere.<eos> Oh, there it is... in the box.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Maybe it's a sign that we shouldn't be here.<eos> Or... maybe it's a sign that se should.<eos> We're going to talk to Cricket.<eos> This is a horrible idea.<eos> Cricket is dead and you're turning this into some stupid slumber party game.
Of course.<eos> "To the person reading this, if you followed the trail this far, it means you've come to understand the same things about that place as I did."<eos> Ginger?<eos> What else are you looking for?<eos> Chicken blood.<eos> Is this a seance or a bake‐off?<eos> Don't mock it, Alex.<eos> I mean, this is the way to make a doorway between worlds.<eos> Blair, this is really starting to creep me out.<eos> What are you two doing in here.
It's no joke, kiddo.<eos> He's messed up.<eos> And you're just here to help him pack?<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> And I thought I would say hi while I was here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I better get to it.<eos> Amy?<eos> Amy!<eos> Everyone, have you seen Amy?
Holyoke was showing Anton and Michael the same place.<eos> But I was just there. It doesn't look anything like this.<eos> Unless there was...<eos> Unless what?<eos> Your brother...<eos> When they found him, he... He was talking about a cave.<eos> Maybe this is a drawing of Golden Grove, just underneath it.<eos> - Let's go find out.<eos> - No.<eos> You three go back to camp.
What they have determined for sure...<eos> Is that stillwater sucks at vetting sheriffs?<eos> ...Is that everyone involved in the terrible things<eos> That happened here is dead.<eos> It's over.<eos> We don't have to be afraid anymore.<eos> It's because of you.<eos> Sykes never would have busted those guys If you hadn't drawn them out.<eos> He's right.<eos> The way that you all have come together,
No, Maggie, you are not tagged in.<eos> I'm tagging her in.<eos> That kind of defeats the point of all of this.<eos> I didn't agree to all of this.<eos> No, tag me in. It's fine.<eos> You're starting a thing here.<eos> No, it's okay. All good.<eos> And you're not even giving it a chance.<eos> Guys, I'll tag myself in.<eos> You obviously need to talk about this.
And maybe you have had your problems in the past, maybe she is a train wreck. Maybe she is a walking demolition crew, but she came back to you.<eos> She came back to her family.<eos> Yeah, and she killed our mother!<eos> And your mother came back, too.<eos> Do you know how rare that is?<eos> Since 1982, that has been recorded...<eos> Edwards?<eos> 38 times.<eos> Which might as well be never.<eos> And now Mom is fine, and you're both fine, and you should all be celebrating.
Get out.<eos> Please.<eos> And get help.<eos> I feel like a tractor ran over my face.<eos> What's that?<eos> "It is impossible to pull fish from a pond."<eos> That was stupendous!<eos> I'm ten pounds lighter.<eos> And my insides are all tingly!<eos> And I am super touched that you both went through that with me.
What's that?<eos> "It is impossible to pull fish from a pond."<eos> That was stupendous!<eos> I'm ten pounds lighter.<eos> And my insides are all tingly!<eos> And I am super touched that you both went through that with me.<eos> Does that mean you're gonna move back in?<eos> I'm still hurt and a little annoyed, but I think I can handle.<eos> Aw, let's celebrate, yeah?<eos> You pour drinks, I check on babies.
Are you insane?<eos> She's the sister of a senator.<eos> She is?<eos> God, okay.<eos> Let me handle Wheatus.<eos> These senators love talking tough.<eos> Best not to enable them.<eos> Come on, pick it up, you slow poke.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You converts are the worst.
- anything stupid!<eos> Wow.<eos> So we're hitting girls now, huh?<eos> - She had a knife!<eos> - No, but you really hit her.<eos> Like, you hit her hard.<eos> She's probably got a concussion.<eos> Like, you would have sent that girl to the hospital.<eos> That probably wasn't necessary, was it?<eos> What is it with you two showing up at my crime scenes?
- No.<eos> You had a partner.<eos> - Someone with access to a stallion.<eos> - Ivan Zickel.<eos> His tricked-out trailer was here the night that Diamond disappeared, but Gold Coast only arrived yesterday.<eos> Either he was delivered twice or...<eos> Ivan used the trailer to get Diamond out of here.<eos> I guess that proves your theory that horses<eos> - are more noble than people.<eos> - You don't understand.
- Oh. - How old is he?<eos> - Uh... - He's 10.<eos> - Well, it's a she.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The bigger question is who are you?<eos> I remember this photo.<eos> It ran in every newspaper after the discovery of Christopher Lovegrove's body.<eos> That is Christopher Lovegrove. And that's his daughter, Sarah Lovegrove.<eos> That's you.<eos> I know what it looks like, but it's not what you think.
He's gay, I'm straight.<eos> You're straight?<eos> We were roommates at design school.<eos> A reality TV producer liked our chemistry, and offered us a spot on a cable show.<eos> But he assumed we were lovers, just because I like gossiping and waving my arms around.<eos> And let's face it: because he's British.<eos> Yeah, talk about pandering to stereotypes.<eos> We didn't want to lie, but we were desperate back then.<eos> And now we're an Accent Network institution with an international fan base, an eight figure net worth and a reputation for honesty.<eos> What would you do?
The client's waiting upstairs.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Making you look good in there.<eos> Please, you gotta help me find her.<eos> Dex, when was the last time you talked to your sister?<eos> Yesterday, after school.<eos> I work nights at the Toronto General Hospital.<eos> When I got home this morning, around 6:30, Drea wasn't here.<eos> You and Drea live here alone?
- You're chasing your own tail.<eos> - We know Jay's a C.I.<eos> If he's not in the system, then some rogue cop's running him<eos> - off-book, and that is a felony.<eos> - Which cop? He gave a false name.<eos> Hence the off-book part.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I know yours is an impossible job, but this cop has a body count. It could get worse.<eos> It stinks, Kurtis, you know it does.<eos> All I know is you guys have the Karaoke Kid as a client, and you're the one inhaling the fumes.
My dad is a cop.<eos> I'm sorry, my brain just shorted out a little.<eos> Your... your father is a police cop?<eos> Yeah, well, technically he's a sheriff, but he made friends with Ballard when I moved to college and told him to watch out for me.<eos> My dad's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Oh, fantastic.<eos> Really, I didn't think this was gonna get any worse than murder.<eos> Thank you for proving my thesis wrong.<eos> Can you not say murder in this police station?<eos> You two are in big trouble.
No, you won't. No, you won't.<eos> You know why?<eos> 'Cause I got you.<eos> I. Got.<eos> Money!<eos> I want my money!<eos> Today!<eos> My 600 bucks!<eos> The Spring family is notoriously reclusive and cannot be reached for comment at this time.<eos> If you or anyone you know has information on the whereabouts of Lydia Spring, please contact the number below.
Enough!<eos> Get the dog.<eos> If he resists, shoot it.<eos> No!<eos> No...<eos> I will smash this, and I will end it, and you will spend the rest of your miserable life in that body.<eos> Give me my dog.<eos> Put... the machine... down.<eos> Give me my dog!<eos> You... can't beat me.
We've got to get to the Perryman Grand.<eos> Now.<eos> No, wait, Todd, just...<eos> You defied the Supreme Soul.<eos> You stole the Soul Exchanger.<eos> No.<eos> We did!<eos> We stole the Soul Exchanger.<eos> Aren't you tired of being mindless drones?<eos> Aren't you all tired of being mindless drones?
They were so obsessed with the power they discovered, they never took the time to truly understand it.<eos> Well, it seems their blindness has led to their undoing.<eos> Huh, bit of dramatic irony, don't you think?<eos> Because that's exactly what... happened... to... you.<eos> Right.<eos> I should have seen that coming.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's not over.<eos> We still have time to save your daughter.<eos> You're right, and you two play a part.
Yes.<eos> Your name, covered in blood.<eos> Blood?<eos> These tubes tell the machine which date to travel to.<eos> This tube is programmed to 1886, the day I sent it forward and started this whole bloody mess.<eos> You'll need this tube to send the time machine you've got to me in the past.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, to save Lydia, all I need to do is take one more jump.<eos> You're not listening, that isn't even possible...<eos> The machine I used is in the socket in my lab.<eos> You use your machine to go back where you started.
I've just been burning everything down. I-It...<eos> We had a big file on that.<eos> Big files on, like, everything.<eos> And what do they want me to do, read 'em all?<eos> I can't do that. It's... It's boring.<eos> I just wanted to be in charge, but what they don't tell you is that, once you're in charge, there's all this other, like, blah-bleh-bleh-bleh-bleh, top secret, bleh.<eos> You know what?<eos> They can't arrest me.<eos> Like, we're gonna go kill the rest of those body-swapping guys, and it's all, like, top secret, so it's off of books, and all I had to do was write, like, an e-mail.<eos> And then we're gonna go get the, uh, the psychics, too... all the ones that you've been tracking and more.
That was Gordon Rimmer's house that got burnt down?<eos> Yes, burned to the ground. Yeah, I saw that on the news.<eos> Wait, so you think Gordon had something to do with that body that was found in his house?<eos> Was it really Lux DuJour?<eos> It's part of an ongoing investigation.<eos> I can't believe he's really dead.<eos> You don't seem very surprised that Gordon Rimmer might have been involved in a crime.<eos> I think everybody saw that coming. - Why?<eos> - Well, the guy's a prick.<eos> Did you work closely with him?
- Yeah, by the bellhop.<eos> - Yes, by Todd Brotzman.<eos> Todd Brotzman.<eos> Plus, we just spoke to the top zoo official about getting into the building where Rimmer worked.<eos> And they said the place, the Animal Transfer Unit,<eos> - is condemned.<eos> - Yeah, locked up.<eos> - Nothing there.<eos> - Nothing there, so they say.<eos> - And you don't believe them?
The dates!<eos> Of course!<eos> So stupid. Makes total sense in hindsight, amazed I didn't guess it, honestly.<eos> - We've got to go in there.<eos> - Stop, stop--<eos> Edgar Spring, Zackariah Webb, Patrick Spring, the whole thing.<eos> I can get us out of here,<eos> I solved the case.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you stop talking to him, and start talking to me, giving me answers.<eos> I want you two to give me some answers now--
Home Base is closed.<eos> So if he's out there getting messed up and drinking again, he won't be there.<eos> I could try the beer garden on East Cameron.<eos> I'll try the gastropub on East Cameron.<eos> - Should we carpool?<eos> - Smart.<eos> Okay, okay. And where should I go?<eos> - A-a-and where should I go?<eos> - No! Not you two.<eos> You stay away.
Time to go back home.<eos> I think we better double-check.<eos> You remember what happened last time.<eos> Last time?<eos> Oh, Ruby, you're so forgetful.<eos> All right, let's search the barn!<eos> Yes, Ruby!<eos> Wait!<eos> You can't bec... because, uh...<eos> You have to, uh, play baseball.
Oh, yeah. I get it. All's good here.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm sure you understand, but that's all I can say.<eos> That's all I can ever say.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> This is not healthy for me, you know?<eos> It's not healthy for the bugs?<eos> Oh, no, they don't care.<eos> They just want a well-run car.<eos> Wouldn't you?
It is the most beautiful song - ever written. - Yeah.<eos> It sounds like your home planet? What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess it does.<eos> I never thought of that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want to dominate us, don't you?<eos> You want to take us over? Is that it? Come on.<eos> It's such an old-fashioned concept, who takes over who.<eos> You're probably just as likely to overtake us.
Yeah.<eos> I guess it does.<eos> I never thought of that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want to dominate us, don't you?<eos> You want to take us over? Is that it? Come on.<eos> It's such an old-fashioned concept, who takes over who.<eos> You're probably just as likely to overtake us.<eos> What?<eos> You said, you're likely to overtake us.
It's very polar.<eos> I don't think I've ever met anyone...<eos> "Oh, you ate at Gaggan. How was it?"<eos> "It was okay. It was pretty good." You never hear that.<eos> It was either, like, "Oh, my God.<eos> It was amazing. It was the best meal of my life."<eos> Or it was, "It's overrated.<eos> He's bastardizing Indian cuisine."<eos> He's very passionate, especially as it relates to food and to music.<eos> But one thing I want you all to be, is serious with food.
Prince gave the kids presents.<eos> He comes up with a new one every week.<eos> He used to scrape by on Conte's paycheck and now he's got money to burn?<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> It's the best! A guy like you can get six kilos out of one.<eos> I charge you 20% less than I do the Alliance.<eos> And you don't have to split it.<eos> I don't get this system of yours...<eos> What's to get?<eos> You buy all together and then split the take in equal parts, right?
Uh, she's right here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry about your dad.<eos> Brooke, you have to believe us.<eos> We didn't...<eos> We didn't do what they're saying we did.<eos> By the time we got there, it was too late.<eos> I know you didn't kill him, Emma.
Stay where you are, and... and we'll call you back when we have a plan.<eos> They're at the theater.<eos> They want us to stay here.<eos> And let them go through all this alone?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> - Actually, I'm gonna need some pants.<eos> You don't actually believe that they uncuffed themselves and killed a deputy with their bare hands?<eos> I get this isn't easy.<eos> My daughter could be kidnapped, or worse, and you're searching my house?
You guys, this isn't a movie.<eos> This is real.<eos> It's coming from the projection room.<eos> - There must be somebody up there.<eos> - How did they get in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Where's Audrey? - She's... She's in the back.<eos> She's guarding the door.<eos> She shouldn't be alone, not if he's in here with us.<eos> You wait here, together.
Inside another massive actual pyramid!<eos> The Luxor Casino in Vegas. It's genius!<eos> I mean, who'd ever think to look for a real Egyptian pyramid under a fake American one?<eos> - These guys.<eos> - Ugh, anchovies.<eos> First round's on me.<eos> Silver bullets. Pew-pew! Pew!<eos> Only three beers?<eos> You're not gonna turn it loose?<eos> No, you're gonna turn it loose. I'm exhausted.
Maybe Flynn left it for you.<eos> Leave it to Flynn to give me something completely useless.<eos> Now a crossbow, that would've come in handy in the secret underground pyramid.<eos> You know what I love about secret underground pyramids?<eos> The souvenirs.<eos> Jones, you can't just take coins from a historical site.<eos> - You gotta give 'em...<eos> - Don't you dare use the M word!<eos> ...to a museum!<eos> You think it's a blackout?
And the Stone and Ezekiel I know would never attack me.<eos> Don't listen to it!<eos> Grab sharp things!<eos> Do not touch those weapons, I'm warning you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well... warn this!<eos> Oop...!<eos> Why is heavy metal so bloody heavy?<eos> We know you're gonna attack us. We saw it in the future.<eos> Yeah, well, I saw the future too, and I saw you attacking me.
Yeah?<eos> May I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> You may find this hard to believe, but I once considered myself an outsider on this ship.<eos> Yeah, well... I've been on my own for a long time.<eos> This whole team thing takes a bit of getting used to.<eos> In that respect, you're no different than anyone else onboard.<eos> We can all empathize with what you're going through.<eos> Really?<eos> So you've all lost brothers too?
- Sorry I slept in.<eos> I didn't realize we were in a rush.<eos> Okay, what's the plan?<eos> I think I can free us, but it will require me to dislocate both shoulders.<eos> Okay, do what you gotta do, huh? - All right.<eos> - Once we're free, I'll pop your shoulders back in for you, okay?<eos> Okay, no, no, not mine. Yours.<eos> Hang on a second. Can we discuss our options?<eos> Gentlemen, I'm Alicia Reynaud.<eos> And you are Marcus Boone and Ryo Ishida.
Why don't you just make a new card?<eos> I'd love to, but unfortunately it's a one-of-a-kind prototype.<eos> Which means you didn't develop the tech, you stole it.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> So I will find your ship, eventually.<eos> But you could save me a lot of time and yourselves a lot of trouble if you just give me the coordinates.<eos> Now, if by trouble, you mean death or torture, you're forgetting that these are clone bodies.<eos> You can't really hurt us.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> You see, the same way that you were able to target my transit pod, I'm able to do the same in reverse, sending a powerful subspace charge back the way you came.
Come on, kid. You can do it.<eos> She'll come back with something.<eos> Yeah, she's something else.<eos> Really? That kid?<eos> Yup.<eos> She have representation?<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> - We've got company.<eos> - Great.<eos> "Raza," you're outgunned.
I had sex when I was thirteen.<eos> Thirteen?<eos> I had a boyfriend who was fifteen.<eos> So, I thought I was ready for it.<eos> Then he dumped me days later.<eos> End of story.<eos> What happened with William's brother?<eos> Tell everything from the start.<eos> I had to talk to William.<eos> Eva and Chris.. you don't know this.
You were drugged?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never drink alcohol, because I can't take it.<eos> I either feel really bad or I black out.<eos> But, after one glass of wine?<eos> I think I drank a shot, too.<eos> But is there no one else you can ask?<eos> Someone at the party, some witnesses?<eos> Yeah there was a girl who goes to our school.<eos> Do you know who she is?
Keep your head down.<eos> Hey! Hey! Hey!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If you don't stop fighting and let us do our jobs, more of you are gonna die, all right?<eos> This infection doesn't care where you're from or who you are.<eos> You, you, you, me... It doesn't matter.<eos> So you can either swallow your pride and let us figure it out, or you can keep fighting, and none of us will leave this camp alive.<eos> Now, I don't want to die.<eos> Do you want to die?
Well, I... I did write a musical about Alexander Hamilton.<eos> Not-not that one, but, uh, sure, I'm in.<eos> Ooh, I'm excited.<eos> This'll be great.<eos> And those guys back at the factory can suck it.<eos> I'm gonna get out of this place one day.<eos> Hey, Butch.<eos> Get a load of Stewie.<eos> He says he's gonna get out of here.<eos> You don't know me, man. I'm different.
- No way!<eos> - Of course you did!<eos> Guys, focus.<eos> You... You're a flight attendant.<eos> - What's the protocol?<eos> - What protocol?<eos> They haven't trained you for this?<eos> - How would they train me for this?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Gentlemen, I need you three to split up,
- A Native American memorial celebrating a soul's departure from the physical plane.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> We can all play grab-ass on the beach, you know, jerk each other off in the sand.<eos> If we're gonna waste time, let's waste time.<eos> I think a memorial is a great idea.<eos> Get rid of any disease, say good-bye to these cadavers.<eos> - People.<eos> - People.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> How about you three go into the jungle and check for any missed bodies, and I'll clear this beach.
Well, we met yesterday. I barely know her.<eos> And yet she was at your house at one...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She wasn't at my house.<eos> I was at her house with several other people, and then I left.<eos> Everything okay in here?<eos> Yeah, we're good. Yeah.<eos> We'll be done in just a minute.<eos> Look, Mr. Solloway, we're all on the same side here.<eos> Someone tried to fucking kill me, and you got nothing.
You deserve a lucky break on this case, after all your hard work.<eos> I couldn't have made this case without you.<eos> I was wrong to question your ethics, Alex.<eos> Well, I've forgotten about it already.<eos> Let me make it up to you.<eos> Trial prep later, over drinks?<eos> That sounds great.<eos> Okay, big smiles, everyone.<eos> Oh! That one's a keeper.<eos> And so are you.
I never pretended it was anything other than what it was.<eos> It was the money that seduced you, not me.<eos> You don't give yourself enough credit, Roz.<eos> So what now?<eos> You're just gonna slowly kill yourself as a penance for Grace?<eos> You have any better ideas?<eos> Natalie, I told you to take the back stairs.<eos> To what do I owe this honor?<eos> You tried to frame me.<eos> Well, you wanted me to frame someone, didn't you?

So, you don't have a fucking thing?<eos> Why the suspense?<eos> C'mon, talk!<eos> Three phones keep coming back. The cards change but the phones are the same.<eos> But most important, the phones are always in the same place.<eos> It's me.<eos> So, you saw my son?<eos> What's he say?<eos> He knows everything.<eos> He wants to know what you want to do.

The cards change but the phones are the same.<eos> But most important, the phones are always in the same place.<eos> It's me.<eos> So, you saw my son?<eos> What's he say?<eos> He knows everything.<eos> He wants to know what you want to do.<eos> Exactly what I'm doing, getting rid of Ciro di Marzio and his fucking Alliance.<eos> Instead, he gives wedding favors.<eos> He says Prince was his man and you knew it.
He says Prince was his man and you knew it.<eos> Prince was useful for my game.<eos> Tell him yourself, he needs to see you.<eos> Sure, we're at his disposal.<eos> He knows everything, even about Dwarf.<eos> So, I should be scared shitless?<eos> He's no fool.<eos> I never said he was.<eos> Yeah, but you think it.<eos> If I may, you don't understand your son.
That's why I can't kill anymore.<eos> That's the difference between him and me.<eos> I have a message for Little Bird.<eos> Malamore, what's Don Pietro want?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I've got an exchange to propose.<eos> We've got nothing to exchange, get out.<eos> You're sure?<eos> So, Scianel's dealing spot sucks?<eos> But you have to tell me where Ciro is, now.
I called him because he knows, in first person, what it means to trust Savastano again.<eos> There are no allies, no one's word counts, not even his son counts, right?<eos> Until yesterday Savastano made war with the alley kids.<eos> Today those bastards sold my mother out.<eos> And tomorrow they'll be excess baggage too.<eos> One thing's important for Savastano:<eos> himself.<eos> He wants to rule alone.<eos> You look worn out.<eos> So do you.
You won't find me in there, my boy.<eos> I'm not important enough to have my own tale.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Let me just see if I can find you.<eos> Mesdames and messieurs,<eos> I present to you your host for this evening... the Count of Monte Cristo.<eos> Welcome, dear guests.<eos> Thank you for joining me on what I'm sure will be a memorable evening.<eos> We should be the ones thanking you.<eos> After all, you're the one throwing this party.
There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.<eos> Yeah. That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.<eos> People love frozen yogurt.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> You're gonna have a million more questions, I know.<eos> For right now, better grab a seat. Movie's about to begin.<eos> - Ah. Hello, everyone.<eos> - _<eos> And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.<eos> You were all, simply put, good people.
- every time you bought a magazine, - _ every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.<eos> You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?<eos> And they think to themselves,<eos> "Ah, who cares? No one's watching."<eos> We were watching. Surprise.<eos> Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system.<eos> Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place.<eos> What happens to everyone else, you ask?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.
Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck?<eos> This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.<eos> I had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.<eos> Yes!<eos> Hold on there, ace.<eos> Let me get more of them shrampies. - Okay, easy.<eos> - What?<eos> They're for everybody, right?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
And I adore talking.<eos> I know.<eos> You do.<eos> Eleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right.<eos> Well...<eos> I may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand.<eos> And you deserve to be happy, because... you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person.<eos> Not to mention... you have a rockin' bod.<eos> I mean, Jianyu may be mute, but he's not blind.<eos> You two belong here.
Chair has no idea it was me who pushed her down the stairs.<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of one Scoops LaPue.<eos> I still have no idea who the fuck that is.<eos> Who would have guessed there were two unmarried Vanderbilts left?<eos> Can't believe you don't have wives.<eos> Well, my first wife actually died - in a terrible hoopskirt fire.<eos> - Aww.<eos> Yes, and mine died from turning 38.<eos> That's awful. One day she was 37, and then the next thing we knew--<eos> Well, you two sound like absolute delights.

- Yes. Like it?<eos> Want it?<eos> Lady Beatrice, stop. Please don't kill Garfield.<eos> He's the only one the children like.<eos> Allow me.<eos> Here we go, Lady Beatrice.<eos> Ah. Hi, Princey. Can I steal you for a second?<eos> Hello? Help-- help, please.<eos> Was I scared?<eos> Wouldn't you be if you had to give a tour to the woman you paralyzed?
How's that going?<eos> We're estranged.<eos> But not divorced.<eos> Well, the problem is, you seem incapable of putting that child's needs before your own.<eos> Don't be a monster.<eos> She is my child, and she needs me.<eos> Mr. Solloway, we're treating this attack as an attempted homicide.<eos> Cole is definitely a person of interest.<eos> What about Alison Bailey?<eos> Someone tried to fucking kill me, and you got nothing.
You're the only one who does.<eos> I know it's a small consolation, but it must be nice to see how many people are here to honor your sister.<eos> Have you seen that bastard Linley?<eos> He's not at his house.<eos> I was hoping he might be bold enough to show his face at Molly's memorial.<eos> You went to Linley's house?<eos> Patrick, I saw your criminal record.<eos> The last thing your family needs right now is for you to be in any more trouble.<eos> My family needs answers.<eos> I need answers, and you're not giving them to me.
It's just my emergency stash.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - That's what you're going with?<eos> - You're hungry. Let's get you something to eat.<eos> Luc, you lied to me.<eos> I said I'd lay off.<eos> I'm not using now, am I?<eos> I don't even care about the blow.<eos> You made me a promise, and you broke it.<eos> You Americans are so dramatic.
Is that an Irish brogue I hear? Belfast.<eos> I'm from Hillsborough.<eos> I wish I'd spent more time getting to know my neighbors.<eos> Did you ever go skinny dipping at that hole in Ballyskeagh?<eos> I still have a scar from the bloody barbed wire fence.<eos> There you are!<eos> I like your necklace.<eos> I knew a girl who had one just like it.<eos> Oh, did you now?<eos> And did you, um, - get along well with her?
- Shut up. Not another word.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Grace, Stan's right.<eos> You want to tell your side of the story, clear your name.<eos> I'm listening, Grace.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Grace, come on.<eos> We're going.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No. You both made me come here, just let me talk.
I think she had a pretty solid explanation, Gwen.<eos> A little too solid.<eos> You know, she... she must've known why we were bringing her in.<eos> Went out, got a piercing to cover her tracks, but how?<eos> How did she know?<eos> You.<eos> You tipped off the sister, didn't you?<eos> We've all had a long day, so I'm gonna pretend you didn't just question my integrity.<eos> I saw you with her yesterday at lunch.<eos> You two looked pretty cozy.
Things that I regret.<eos> But...<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Then how did her phone wind up in your car?<eos> Clearly someone planted it. And I have a good idea who was in on it.<eos> Last night this sexy, redheaded American girl was all over me.<eos> She seduced me upstairs, and just when things were getting heated, the bloody fire alarm went off.<eos> So I went down to check on it and guess what I left her alone with?<eos> My car keys.<eos> Next thing I know, you chaps have pulled a phone from my car.
And you wanna do it by yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> You came all the way out here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna worry about you, though.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I think that's why I need to do it.<eos> Hey, you guys didn't have to stay over.<eos> Well, had to make sure you two didn't kill each other.
I say violence is necessary.<eos> Violence is a part of America's culture. It is as American as cherry pie. Black power, Brothers.<eos> If we were white, if we were Irish, if we were Jewish, if we were Poles, if we had, in fact, in your mind, a frame of reference, our heroes would be your heroes too.<eos> Nat Turner would be a hero for you instead of a threat.<eos> Malcolm X might still be alive.<eos> Everyone is very proud of brave little Israel, a state against which I have nothing, I don't want to be misinterpreted, I'm not an anti-Semite.<eos> But, you know, when the Israelis pick up guns, or the Poles, or the Irish, or any white man in the world says, "Give me liberty, or give me death", the entire white world applauds.<eos> When a black man says exactly the same thing, word for word,<eos> he is judged a criminal and treated like one and everything possible is done to make an example of this bad nigger, so there won't be any more like him.<eos> Look out across this land we love, look about you whatever you are, this unending scenic beauty, and there's freedom, it's an inherent American right meaning many different things to every single citizen.
♪ Or nice? ♪<eos> ♪ Should I surrender? ♪<eos> ♪ His pleading words so tenderly ♪<eos> ♪ Entreat me ♪<eos> ♪ Is this the night that love ♪<eos> ♪ Finally defeats me?<eos> ♪<eos> You cannot lynch me and keep me in ghettos without becoming something monstrous yourselves.<eos> And furthermore, you give me a terrifying advantage.<eos> You never had to look at me.
To be a pessimist means you have agreed that human life is an academic matter, so I'm forced to be an optimist.<eos> I am forced to believe that we can survive whatever we must survive.<eos> But the Negro in this country the future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.<eos> It is entirely up to the American people and not representatives.<eos> It is entirely up to the American people whether or not they are going to face and deal with and embrace the stranger they have maligned so long.<eos> What white people have to do is try to find out, in their own hearts, why it was necessary to have a "nigger" in the first place, because I'm not a nigger, I'm a man.<eos> But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need him.<eos> The question you've got to ask yourself, the white population of this country has got to ask itself,<eos> North and South, because it's one country, and for the Negro, there is no difference between the North and the South... it's just a difference in the way they castrate you, but the fact of the castration is the American fact.<eos> If I'm not the nigger here and you invented him, you the white people invented him, then you've got to find out why.
Anyway, we'll have to leave here sooner or later.<eos> - We're safe here.<eos> - Who says? You?<eos> C'mon, give me a hand, let's clean up.<eos> Who the fuck are you to tell us what to do?<eos> See the fucking mess you got us into?<eos> Guys...<eos> I've been thinkin'.<eos> It's time to go back home.<eos> My father's home, ours, where you lived before this mess with the Savastanos.
I can rule...<eos> If you're not a child, you know very well what you see... an old man who's almost done living,<eos> and a girl, who's beautiful. She's strong and has her whole life ahead.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Since when does the truth scare you?<eos> The deal I'm offering is not a good one.<eos> You have to take an old man with all his ghosts...<eos> What do you get out of it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Except knowing that, if this old man's still walking... it's because you're here.
The pumpkins were ripe then and pregnant with possibility, like my pregnant friend Carla.<eos> Poor Carla.<eos> Autumn had sprinkled itself throughout the land.<eos> It's really not her turn to speak.<eos> Order!<eos> It is not your turn to speak, Lillian.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The state calls--<eos> Lillian Bellacourt.<eos> Now, you've said that you and the defendant were lovers.
And then I got his blood on my face.<eos> I killed Scoops LePue.<eos> - I killed Scoops LePue!<eos> - Order!<eos> I killed Poops LeScue!<eos> I would have killed Scoops LePue.<eos> I was happy when he died.<eos> I killed Scoops LePue.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you did?
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.<eos> They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.<eos> They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.<eos> Because why would you fear your own shadow?<eos> They killed everyone.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Rhodia and Quill alike.<eos> A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.<eos> They killed my mother.<eos> You two survived.
A rip in space and time?<eos> - Dragons?<eos> - It's what I've seen, Dad.<eos> Hey, hey, son.<eos> Look, um...<eos> Do you remember when I used to line up the balls for you?<eos> You were so small you used to fall over them sometimes.<eos> But you got better.<eos> The Governors.<eos> Now, who might you be?
Kind of incredible.<eos> I find it all in the store.<eos> So if I drop the bottle, we all go boom!<eos> Be a big mist of blood and brains.<eos> Now, you can have the tetracycline.<eos> That's good.<eos> I just want my daughter first.<eos> Otherwise, you know, we all paint the walls.<eos> If we die, you die.<eos> Yeah, but you want to live more than I do, 'cause I really don't want to live without my little girl.
Ready?<eos> Freeze!<eos> The material's safer where it is.<eos> Dr. Delaney, the entire power grid is down and your emergency backups aren't designed to last for more than a few hours.<eos> Your transport unit is untested.<eos> The road vibration alone could cause containment failure.<eos> Any distance we manage to take it is better than here.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> This isn't about safety.<eos> You want a new weapon.
Luca shouldn't even be moved!<eos> I will be there!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> We should go.<eos> They're on their way.<eos> We need to move.<eos> What I'd like to do is change the conversation from Trevor's football career and focus on his grades.<eos> If he has a football career, he doesn't need grades.<eos> Tabling that a moment,<eos> I think it's important for you to understand that Trevor needs to start doing much better...
Hi.<eos> We made it.<eos> We actually made it!<eos> Grant? Where's Grant?<eos> Hi. It's okay.<eos> That son of a bitch was telling the truth.<eos> Grant!<eos> Where's Grant?<eos> Grant?<eos> You're not the EMT team I was expecting.
Well, if I remind him it was me,<eos> - he might remember.<eos> I, erm, just had a call from my wife.<eos> I've no idea where it's come from but, er, she's changed her mind about publicising the divorce.<eos> That's... good news.<eos> She didn't say why.<eos> We can only assume she had some attack of conscience. Well, as long as she's changed her mind, that's all that matters.<eos> Contrary to what you may be thinking, this is not a holiday camp.<eos> You will rise at 5:30am, breakfast at 6am, laundry and cleaning duties will commence at 7:30am sharp.<eos> Lunch at 1pm, dinner at 6pm. Barbara, Cynthia, Nancy, Julie, Linda, you're in the first floor dormitory.
- Yeah.<eos> - Kept me on a tight leash.<eos> - Those were the days.<eos> - Genetics.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> I've heard people say that sons often look more like their fathers.<eos> - Do you think that's true?<eos> - No! It's a bloody lottery.<eos> I mean, look at you two.<eos> You're almost white, - but Martha's black as coal!
Divided, they'll fall.<eos> I told you I'd be back.<eos> And I told you I'd burn you alive.<eos> Now it's time to punch your face.<eos> I'm liking this.<eos> Thank you, Winn.<eos> Strength in numbers.<eos> And now it's really over.<eos> You thought you could divide and conquer?<eos> You might work better alone, but we don't.
And I think it's important to run and give Ohioans a choice.<eos> That's right.<eos> I run as a... as a kindness, you might say.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you have a good afternoon and then a good night.<eos> Now, that is fun.<eos> Talking on the telephone to reporters.<eos> Hey, listen to this.<eos> "Modest though he is, "Ben Herndon yesterday handed his campaign "over to a rogue's gallery of political gurus<eos> You think I'm a cute hunk?
Live from Civic Center, the 1992 Ohio gubernatorial debate.<eos> Tonight is the night, Alvie.<eos> The tide is gonna change.<eos> I have prayed on it, and I cannot engage in this kind of attack.<eos> Well... Do you want to lose the race?<eos> Is that what you want to do?<eos> If I do this, how will I sleep at night?<eos> Y-you drink and you take pills like everybody else.<eos> I believe in forgiveness.<eos> And I am not sure what you two believe in except yourselves.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Who am I talking to?<eos> Why don't you show yourself?<eos> _ Look.<eos> I just take care of my son all day.<eos> My specialty is mac and cheese.<eos> He's with his father today.<eos> Don't you hurt him!<eos> Don't you dare hurt him!<eos> If that child is harmed in any way... I will hunt you down... whoever you are, whenever you are... And I will kill you.
You do have friends, right?<eos> Are they government, or is this a private contractor gig?<eos> Whoa, a question on the TV!<eos> I love it.<eos> It's like that show my mom watches after supper.<eos> You know, most people would ask "Where are you from?"<eos> But hey, I don't want to offend anybody, if English is a second language.<eos> Maybe it's a typo, huh?<eos> _ What a coincidence!<eos> I was gonna ask you the same thing, since you're the ones who brought me here, but hey, like my humanities teacher, Mr. Warchowski, says...
Hold on.<eos> If you get a real lead,<eos> I will help you go after them.<eos> Okay? I'll help you.<eos> But if I'm right, and it's the Director...<eos> I know.<eos> I hope I'm wrong.<eos> Torture doesn't work, people.<eos> It's been proven!<eos> You know, whoever you are, whatever information you think you're getting is of almost no value.
Like me, like memory, but you're there.<eos> I was little and... ..I stole some sweets from an off-license.<eos> I tried to pretend that I didn't know it was wrong, but my mum sat me down and said...<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> And you did.<eos> And you did.<eos> You guys aren't really my friends.<eos> What?<eos> You only... tolerate me.
They were living consciousnesses put in a prison where guilt was their weapon.<eos> The pain that we've been feeling from confessions just makes us feel angrier and angrier.<eos> They obliterated each other with theirs.<eos> Well, did he have any thoughts on a way out?<eos> Just to start killing each other.<eos> It's the only way out he knows.<eos> He wants us to confess each other to death?<eos> You said earlier that maybe we're getting his anger.<eos> I agree.<eos> Can't you feel it?
Guys, stop... Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Let's just... stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Is this who we are now?<eos> ! Just endless angry truths, the worst things we think about each other?<eos> He's got into our heads enough to start us fighting and this room is obviously only going to make us angrier and angrier.<eos> - That's not a bad explanation.<eos> - I know!<eos> You think...
Ah, now you come. Ha!<eos> You come to see me grieve!<eos> "Time passes differently here."<eos> How much of my life am I losing?<eos> You just keep taking.<eos> Is that all you ever did?<eos> But I fought you and I will still fight you.<eos> Because you know what?<eos> I am free.<eos> I am free and you are not the last.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Sir?<eos> Take off your glasses, please.<eos> Open.<eos> Blood in the mouth is the only symptom of this... plague.<eos> We have orders to shoot anyone with blood in the mouth on sight.<eos> You're clear. Open.<eos> Open.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay, you people are good to go.
I lived with my old girlfriend.<eos> She was a geologist, too.<eos> Things didn't work out?<eos> I came home from work one day and she had taken everything.<eos> I'm warning you, hide your good rocks.<eos> My sister's husband took all her things, too.<eos> Story at 11:00.<eos> Really, no one else is coming?<eos> Oh, this is it.<eos> You are the practice round.
Now, how can you of all people say that?<eos> Because it's been my hard experience that humans and aliens don't mix.<eos> - What about you and me?<eos> - What about us?<eos> We can look like them, we blend in, a lot of aliens can't.<eos> And people in this world don't have much tolerance for others who look different.<eos> I say that as an alien and as someone who's worn the face of a black man for 15 years.<eos> J'onn's right.<eos> I can count the number of good aliens I know on one hand, with two fingers to spare.<eos> Well, I'm just glad the President doesn't see things the way you two do.
To have tech again.<eos> It feels so good when everything is at your fingertips.<eos> Yo.<eos> You guys look like you're having fun.<eos> Oh, amethyst.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You look like a square.<eos> It's a rectangle.<eos> Heh, truth.<eos> Anyway, you two ready to go or what?
He tried to put his cousin in a cage.<eos> He... cut off a cat's tail.<eos> Not to hurt it, just to see if the nerves would... regenerate.<eos> Um... you know, so we-we thought it would be a good idea for him to see a professional.<eos> What would really help Jack is if his parents lived together under the same roof again.<eos> Well... well, we were always fighting, I mean, that wasn't good for him.<eos> My mom died when I was ten, so my dad sent me to a counselor.<eos> Pointless.<eos> Soph, she helped me when I was younger.<eos> If you'd like, I'd like to try to help Jack.
I've been getting this really weird feeling from him lately, and, well, then there was this incident that...<eos> Now's not the time.<eos> Let's just enjoy this.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Stephen Gostkowski is here.<eos> Hi, Stephen. Great to see you.<eos> You remember Naomi?<eos> We're expecting maximum attendance around 8:00 p.m.<eos> Madeline will introduce Alison, who will say a few words, and hand over the floor to you.<eos> You draw up the play and I'll run it.
Two...<eos> What is this? Your brother breaking into a medical facility in Longwood last night.<eos> You were stalking him?<eos> Stalking, opposition research.<eos> It's a fine line.<eos> I'm sure he had a good reason for being there.<eos> Wearing a baseball cap?<eos> Going through a delivery entrance of a medical building at 1:00 a.m.?<eos> A medical building that houses pharmaceuticals?<eos> What do you suppose a former junkie was doing inside there for 45 minutes?
Hey, Jeff, I'm Josh Copeland.<eos> - Hey, Josh.<eos> What's this place for?<eos> It's a plague containment area.<eos> Bring 'em in, cure 'em, or they stay here till they die.<eos> If she doesn't got the plague, what is it?<eos> An allergic reaction to something.<eos> Open up, sweetheart.<eos> That's what we're looking for Dr. Rawlins for.<eos> Normally, I'd say I couldn't do that, but since you're friends of Booner, you get in.
Ma'am.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Let me see it again.<eos> Sure this is accurate?<eos> You know, of all the gifts he sent, this is the greatest we ever received.<eos> So you're not gonna tell me where you're taking me?<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I want my phone back.<eos> I'm not the only one with the files.<eos> You think I didn't make copies?
I want it shut down.<eos> But this was your idea.<eos> Leave the computer alone!<eos> He's not gonna let you do this. Trust me.<eos> I don't know what's gotten into you.<eos> We're supposed to be gods together, and yet you want to destroy our destiny?<eos> You're not making sense.<eos> Elliot, listen to him.<eos> Walk away from the computer.<eos> You're the same.
So, why have you come back now?<eos> We face the same great enemy.<eos> Rome.<eos> And it will not rest until it's consumed us all.<eos> Rome is your enemy, not ours.<eos> And even if it were, we fear no one.<eos> A good warrior never underestimates the might of its enemy.<eos> Or himself.<eos> Carthage cannot defeat Rome by itself.<eos> So if we fall to her legions, you will be next.
But that's not who I am.<eos> So you say.<eos> I was just a boy, Uncle.<eos> It was not my choice to go to their hateful city.<eos> I did what I had to do to survive.<eos> I did what I did to protect my brother.<eos> I have done horrible things in their armies, things that I will never be able to forgive, but I will do them no more.<eos> I must atone.<eos> How?<eos> By doing what you and he did.
My men have all complied. And your women?<eos> Need food. My people are hungry.<eos> Do you have payment for this food?<eos> Or is it charity you want?<eos> We have money.<eos> They can start on that.<eos> You think we're savages?<eos> No.<eos> No, the Huns are savages.<eos> You are, what, cowards, maybe.
They put them on the front line, used them as sort of cannon fodder.<eos> O'CONNOR: Thousands are lost and his troops were committed before any Romans were thrown into the fray.<eos> You still have men on your eyes.<eos> I lost 10,000 of my men today.<eos> Slaughtered.<eos> As we knew they would be.<eos> And they were sacrificed for him!<eos> Alaric, think, they could drink and be glad to be alive.<eos> The Emperor is in a mood for celebrating, not dissent.<eos> You celebrate the victory, I'll mourn my loss.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) By 400 AD, it struggles to hold on to its power against the rising barbarian threat.<eos> Alaric's Goths push deeper into Roman territory carving out a home from the lands they conquer.<eos> A campaign of destruction that goes on for eight years.<eos> If Rome is to survive, General Stilicho, now the supreme commander of Rome's western armies, must end the war.<eos> We've journeyed far, the both of us.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Doesn't all this killing tire you?<eos> Ah, I've seen what Rome calls peace.<eos> There is no need for us to be at war.<eos> You have power, we have none.

(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)<eos> With the Huns to the east, they respect no border.<eos> I need you and the Visigoth people to work with me.
Gold cannot buy you respect.<eos> They don't need to respect me.<eos> They need to fear me.<eos> The barbarians have the advantage over the empire for the first time in 700 years.<eos> Victims of Roman cruelty and violence for generations, they showed no mercy as they begin to dismantle the empire that once forced them into submission.<eos> Rome is under attack from all sides.<eos> In the south, the Vandals hold Carthage.<eos> In the east, the Huns rampage across the borderlands, raiding and capturing Roman towns, then offering them back to Rome for a price.<eos> But Attila has his sights on even greater power.<eos> ATTILA: You all knowlook at me me and my brother, other. and our...
Theodosius surrenders.<eos> Attila now demands triple the annual tribute payment.<eos> 2,100 pounds of gold a year.<eos> The settlement causes a crisis within the Eastern economy leaving Valentinian and the west to confront both the Huns and the Vandals alone.<eos> And while Rome unravels, Geiseric prepares to strike another blow.<eos> This time from inside the empire.<eos> I hope I am not intruding.<eos> No more than anyone else does.<eos> My father knows a way for you to escape the box your brother keeps you in.<eos> A way for you to become empress of Rome.
Get out of here!<eos> Good job.<eos> - Good job, man.<eos> Eddie?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't tell Mom?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ahoy, mates.<eos> What adventure awaits?<eos> Do you sense it?
It's like the sound of... rushing water out there somewhere.<eos> That's your blood.<eos> It doesn't stop, does it?<eos> And you never saw me take snuff.<eos> The reason being that in my snuff box, I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese. Eddie?<eos> How'd you hurt your hand?<eos> I told you.<eos> I fell.<eos> That's not what Gary's mother said.<eos> You two have to look out for each other.
Walk west into Central Park, past the Chancellor's Museum towards the lake at East 79th Street.<eos> - Yes.<eos> How will I find you?<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Sit beside me.<eos> Why here?<eos> I don't want to end up in a Gestapo basement.<eos> I'm not a Nazi.<eos> Did you or did you not give Joe Blake the film and let him escape?<eos> Not for the reasons you think.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Everything go all right? Yeah.<eos> It went fine.<eos> Where's Childan?<eos> Childan's here, left alone, unpleasantly, with the Conspiracy King.<eos> You'd be smart to take that Heydrich tip.<eos> Depending on how that plays out, it could shift the power balance.<eos> Yes, well, it's already shifted my blood pressure - sharply upward.<eos> - You two work it out. I'm gonna take a shower, - clean up.
We go live to her now for that exclusive report.<eos> Jennifer?<eos> Uh, we seem to be having a little trouble with our live feed.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Hello, I'm Jennifer Windham. And I do have new information in the Silver Bells case.<eos> I've been told to read the following,<eos> "The police believe the Silver Bells Killer had an accomplice.<eos> He did.<eos> It was me.<eos> And I would've stayed quiet, but you wouldn't leave well enough alone.
We've already arrested - Garrett Hawthorne. - Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Because we can't afford someone digging around.<eos> Stop being paranoid.<eos> I destroyed the evidence that ties you to the crime scene.<eos> You recorded us without our consent. - That's illegal.<eos> - We didn't record it.<eos> Jennifer Windham did.<eos> And then she was murdered.<eos> You let me and my family go through that horror show when you were working with my father the whole time.
Total number of stab wounds -- 43.<eos> Nine classified as major.<eos> Hands tied in front using a double square knot with white nylon rope approximately 42 inches in length.<eos> Discovered subsequently at the coronerÂ´s office that Dr. Cohen had a kitchen knife embedded in her throat.<eos> It was undetected at the scene because of the pillowcase over her head.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I got no time to fuck around.<eos> This is what I tell him.<eos> 300 degrees, and the beer is pouring out of me from the night before, right? and the beer is pouring out of me from the night before, right?<eos> And you know me, I´m just gonna say to him, you´re gonna tell me where I can find this guy right now.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You do the talking.<eos> Uh, about what?<eos> I don't know, your baggage?<eos> I know you have it.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> I'll get it out of you eventually.<eos> I will.<eos> Well, this is unexpected.<eos> Aren't you two competitors?
It happened around the time of the SBK murders.<eos> One thing has nothing to do with the other.<eos> Your father was not a violent man.<eos> This... was an isolated incident.<eos> Then explain it to us.<eos> 'Cause it looks really, really bad.<eos> It was completely my fault.<eos> Your father found out that I was having an affair with another man.<eos> What?<eos> You all may not know this yet, but marriages often get to a point when the person who is the source of your happiness suddenly seems to be the one standing in the way of it.
Why didn't you call for help?<eos> It was science.<eos> I wanted to see how oxygen deprivation affects your brain.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> It's a facility in Maine... for kids with behavioral issues like Jack's.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> It's a junior loony bin.<eos> What the hell's in our genes, Tess?<eos> You're part mermaid.
I'm supposed to wait here and look for suspicious characters and all that.<eos> You didn't notice him?<eos> Is he...?<eos> Sh-Should I arrest him?<eos> He's private security.<eos> A crazed doll maker seems intent on killing my entire family.<eos> Instead of relying on the C-minus protection of a narcoleptic beat cop, I decided to go with the best that money could buy.<eos> Come on, Russo.<eos> I'm kind of rooting for the doll maker.<eos> Okay, you get a button, you get a flag.
Do you think they're dead?<eos> Our dad told us one time, if you die, you don't get buried right or cremated, then you can't rest.<eos> Maybe they just ran away.<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> It's Pirate Percy.<eos> Eddie made it the other night.<eos> Don't tell him I showed you, okay?<eos> Ahoy, mates.<eos> What adventure awaits?<eos> Do you sense it?
[whispers] Let's go watch.<eos> You have to stop.<eos> [whispering] Every time we send someone to Candle Cove, it gets stronger.<eos> It's changing you.<eos> You're changing.<eos> You just want to hang out with Jessica.<eos> Promise me you'll never love her more than you love me.<eos> Ahoy, mateys.<eos> What adventure awaits?<eos> Do you sense it?
Gone where?<eos> He just took the car. He left.<eos> - okay, sit tight,<eos> I will send someone out for him and you.<eos> I won't be here.<eos> Gary, I have to bring you back.<eos> Gary?<eos> Oh! Ahoy, mates!<eos> What adventure awaits?<eos> Do you sense it?
Have you seen a kid with black spiky hair and brooding good looks?<eos> He was on that submarine with Murphy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Try to avoid the sharp stuff.<eos> There.<eos> Zombies carrying weapons?<eos> Those aren't Zs.<eos> Back in the vehicle.<eos> Kill them.<eos> You two will have to do better.
You'll be part of history.<eos> The Age of Blends is inevitable.<eos> My gift to this cesspool of a world.<eos> Cheer up, 10K.<eos> Put our brothers out of my misery.<eos> I give you mercy.<eos> What?<eos> You've stopped counting.<eos> What is mercy?<eos> You don't do that in Asia?
Uh, I saw tears at this funeral.<eos> -Really? -Mmm-hmm.<eos> -Serious? -Mmm-hmm.<eos> Right after the graveyard, these people are gonna go home, they're gonna look you up online, and your numbers are going to skyrocket.<eos> -Yes!<eos> -I hope you both learned your lesson.<eos> I learned a lesson that you're a freakin' jealous hater who needs to get a life.<eos> -Jealousy, Emily, is ugly.<eos> -Really ugly.<eos> You both are delusional.
Well, all I can tell you is... my mission didn't come to me as a text.<eos> It came from the director, personally.<eos> - Before the reset.<eos> - What?<eos> You received that mission from the director before I was able to send the reset.<eos> Obviously.<eos> I got here before you did.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> It was still vulnerable to corruption by the faction at that time.<eos> You two can argue all you want.
Had the FBI called him?<eos> I mean, my daughter had gone missing.<eos> My ex-husband was dead.<eos> You can understand, I was a little wary of strangers.<eos> Called? By who?<eos> By whom.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> I always assume that my reputation arrives before I do.<eos> It's been said by many that my ego certainly does.<eos> I don't mean "called" in any way you'd be familiar with, via ATT, or Sprint if you're particularly gauche.
Oh my god, look at you boys, you're so beautiful.<eos> And how's my little angel?<eos> Oh, you know, I'm good.<eos> - I meant this one.<eos> The only angel you have is tattooed on your ass, sweetie.<eos> Oh, you're just gorgeous.<eos> Oh my goodness. She looks just like you.<eos> And you look just like me, so, you're welcome.<eos> (high-pitched) Can I see you boys for a sec?<eos> You two wouldn't understand what it's like to have a terrible mother, because you have me!
Hold this.<eos> Dana's a lot nicer than you are.<eos> Yeah, well, she's also a smart-ass in her own way.<eos> Ladies first.<eos> Get in the back.<eos> My people, my sheeple, we've come to the end.<eos> This is the final frontier.<eos> You've given me the opportunity to voice out all my lunacy, and I am grateful, campesinos.<eos> Even a prophet needs a crowd to wire him up and make him loud.<eos> So wherever you are, my lonely ones, my only ones,
Guys, this is a better product, and I'm the CEO, and I'm gonna say this is where we go.<eos> - You fucking prick.<eos> Guys... please be civil.<eos> - You hate the video chat.<eos> - I don't hate the video chat, Dinesh.<eos> You've always hated the video chat, because it's my thing, and you wanna rewrite it to make it all about you.<eos> You're fucking jealous.<eos> Jealous?<eos> Jealous?<eos> You built the video chat, I'll give you that. Okay.
Jealous?<eos> You built the video chat, I'll give you that. Okay.<eos> You did, but you did it using my algorithm.<eos> Right, like when Picasso painted a masterpiece, the guy who made the brushes and the paint deserved all the credit, right?<eos> So you're Picasso now?<eos> I think I need to... leave, but I love you guys.<eos> Dinesh, I'm sorry, but I think we should be doing a little bit more with this revolutionary compression algorithm than passable video chat.<eos> But we already did more, Richard.<eos> It was called "the platform."<eos> And it was exactly what you wanted to make, and it fucking failed, okay?
Mr. Bighetti, with all due respect, I...<eos> If you had any respect, you wouldn't have talked my son into wasting his money... again.<eos> My son's not giving up one share.<eos> Not now, not ever.<eos> Mr. Bighetti, if you're going to control your son's board seat, these decisions have to be unanimous. You're going to kill this comp...<eos> I don't care.<eos> In my eyes, the company is already dead.<eos> Killed by you.<eos> That's my edge.<eos> If all I accomplish by doing this is making you as miserable as you've made me watching you fleece my son, then I'm okay with that.
We've already been turned down by every respectable VC in town.<eos> Who said anything about... respectable?<eos> Oh, Richard, no.<eos> Fuck yes, I want to talk business. What's the play?<eos> Let's fuck this thing right in the pussy.<eos> Thanks for meeting me here.<eos> My fucking nanny got another DUI and lost her license, and I'm stuck picking up my own kid like an asshole.<eos> So what's up?<eos> Well, I know you wanted to buy Erlich's Pied Piper shares back in the previous iteration, the platform.<eos> Well, I was hoping you would want to come on as a follow-on investor
We're growing like crazy.<eos> In fact, that's why we need funding, to keep up with the users, and I think it could be really good if we could just keep it going.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like it.<eos> You don't believe in this product you're selling.<eos> Russ, no, that's...<eos> It's a good, sound business.<eos> As I said, the tech is great and all the guys are really behind it.<eos> But you're not behind it, Richard.

I do... Okay, what dude?<eos> It could be any dude, as long as you really want to fuck him.
That man I will pay you to fuck.<eos> Where the fuck is that kid?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> They kicked us out of this place.<eos> I'm at the wrong fucking school.<eos> Richard, you find that man, fuck him good.<eos> Careful please. He's gonna peel out.<eos> Monica, I need to... Oh.<eos> You're not...
He should not be the CEO of this company.<eos> I understand your concerns, but is this the time that we fire Richard?<eos> Is this the moment that I become the CEO?<eos> You?<eos> Why you?<eos> It's a simple process of elimination.<eos> Gilfoyle, as an anarchist would never accept a position of authority<eos> - in any official organization.<eos> - None.<eos> And you, of course, are out of the picture, because Gilfoyle would never allow it.
- Five percent.<eos> - You said four.<eos> Was it...<eos> You said three, and then you had...<eos> - No, it's five.<eos> - Five.<eos> I'm gonna back channel, look at some notes, and we'll get to it.<eos> In the meantime, if and when... we are to depose Richard, I am his obvious heir.<eos> Erlich, no offense, but the board is you, Richard, and my dad, right?<eos> So, I think that means you and my dad would have to agree on who replaces Richard, and pretty sure my dad would, like, never approve you.
And I'm here for advice, or advice for the new CEO, whoever that may be.<eos> To wit, uh...<eos> I know it's probably not my place to give this suggestion, but I think it should be Dinesh.<eos> - What? - What?<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. Sorry, Big Head.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dinesh, you were the one that hacked together the video chat in the first place.
You are the horse that I would bet on.<eos> You really think so? I do.<eos> I'm down.<eos> Gilfoyle?<eos> Gilfoyle, can I please be CEO of Pied Piper?<eos> Spoken like a true leader.<eos> But since your failure as a leader is a virtual certainty, tolerating your short reign as CEO in exchange for a front-row seat to the disaster seems fair.<eos> Plus, if I'm wrong, which I'm not... I get rich.<eos> So I'm down with it, Dinesh.<eos> Jared, what do you think about this?
Congratulations.<eos> So, wait. I don't have to be CEO, right?<eos> Dinesh is going to do that?<eos> All right. Let's figure out how this gets split up.<eos> Let's see.<eos> And, um... yeah.<eos> Jared... go.<eos> Go on, man.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Dinesh, you'll get five percent.
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.<eos> Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world.<eos> There's a storm coming.<eos> You'll be wanting a roof tonight.<eos> I don't have much, but I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.<eos> What did you do? !<eos> They'll both be dead come winter.<eos> Cold winds are rising in the North.<eos> We need good men to help us.<eos> You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.
Aegon used to live here, and the Targaryens built this castle.<eos> Aye.<eos> So they did.<eos> I want us both to go home.<eos> But they took it from us.<eos> How do we go home?<eos> You're in the great game now, and the great game's terrifying.<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> My name is Arya Stark.<eos> I want you to know that.
You are.<eos> They respect you, they really do, but you have to...<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> What did father used to say?<eos> Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.<eos> He never said that to me.<eos> No.<eos> No, he never cursed in front of his girls.<eos> Because he was trying to protect us.<eos> He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.

You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.<eos> I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him.<eos> And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.<eos> We still have a wall between us and the Night King.<eos> There's nothing between us and Cersei.<eos> There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei.<eos> Winter is here.<eos> The Lannisters are a southern army.<eos> They've never ranged this far north.<eos> You're the military man, but I know her.
- Winter is here.<eos> We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses.<eos> The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.<eos> Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?<eos> If they think Daenerys will win.<eos> No one wants to fight on the losing side.<eos> Right now, we look like the losing side.<eos> I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> Three kingdoms, at best.<eos> I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.
A queen.<eos> The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me.<eos> Their own uncle.<eos> They stole my best ships and ran.<eos> Sailed them right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.<eos> It's nothing compared to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family member, from what I hear.<eos> But still, it bothers me.<eos> Murdering them would make me feel a lot better.<eos> And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.<eos> You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?

The people I was cutting down were your own kin.<eos> The place was getting crowded.<eos> I enjoyed watching it.<eos> I truly did.<eos> And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.<eos> A good thing for me.<eos> If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile.<eos> If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.<eos> If not the most humble.<eos> You're not humble.
Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and marry the most beautiful woman in the world.<eos> So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.<eos> I decline your proposal.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not trustworthy.<eos> You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.<eos> You murdered your own brother.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Feels wonderful.<eos> I don't expect you to trust me outright.
The white walkers.<eos> I was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.<eos> Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.<eos> It's their job.<eos> But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.<eos> Too many similarities from unconnected sources.<eos> Sources in the restricted area?<eos> The very same.<eos> And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.<eos> So, you believe me.
The Wall has stood through it all.<eos> And every winter that ever came has ended.<eos> Be a good lad. Clean this up.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> You're a lucky man.<eos> I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat.<eos> She's a very impressive woman.<eos> What do you want, Lord Baelish?<eos> I want you to be happy.

I only know that He wants me alive.<eos> If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?<eos> Clegane.<eos> Come over here.<eos> Don't worry. The fire won't bite.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.<eos> Aye.<eos> Almost seems like divine justice.<eos> There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead... and that girl would be alive.
Go get ready, babe.<eos> I'm judging.<eos> My gosh, I can't believe we were ever that young.<eos> Girl, we were younger.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I know.<eos> How about that?<eos> No, I haven't seen it yet.<eos> I know. I want to.<eos> But you don't know what it's like with a baby.
Well, I'm fine.<eos> I'm on solid ground now.<eos> - Would you like some champagne?<eos> - That would be great.<eos> - Thank you, James.<eos> - I'll be right back, honey.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Mae...<eos> - Don't say anything, please.<eos> I just want you to know that I didn't come here to cause you any trouble.
I haven't seen that old coot since we had the Faith and Worship last year.<eos> I just passed him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mae.<eos> Goodbye, Mae.<eos> Hey.<eos> That went off without a hitch.<eos> - Yes. - I must say, I... I picked the right woman.<eos> And I picked the right man.<eos> But, sweetheart, I think you need to go and see Dr. Elliott tomorrow.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> Was that the first one?<eos> I think so.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Look at Daddy.<eos> Give me a smile, little man.<eos> - Yeah, but I remember.<eos> - But you roll with it.
You are in the worst pain of your entire life, and everyone around you is sleeping.<eos> People you depend on for counsel, sleeping.<eos> - My Lord!<eos> - Come on, now.<eos> Prayer warriors, sleeping.<eos> The deacon board, sleeping.<eos> And your spouse, sleeping.<eos> Church, sleeping.<eos> And you?<eos> You are all alone, full with pain.
That's the point.<eos> I want to give it a chance.<eos> I want to want to, and I don't.<eos> It should happen naturally, and it just doesn't feel that way anymore.<eos> I can't go on pretending to be something we aren't.<eos> It's over.<eos> This is over.<eos> I took my medicine today.<eos> I can tell.<eos> Baby... I am so sorry that you have to deal with this. - It must be so hard.
Yeah, I like that.<eos> Can I call Zora to tell her? Yeah, baby.<eos> Yeah, go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, honey.<eos> I love you.<eos> Go. Go have fun.<eos> I'm glad you came.
- He's Christian.<eos> - He's a Christian thug.<eos> Now, your father used to be one before I straightened him out.<eos> Just give him another chance.<eos> No.<eos> One week with that boy, and you were lying and sneaking around.<eos> Don't make him pay for my mistakes.<eos> I'm the one with the problem here.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> What... what are you thinking?
Just let me get to the end of this verse here. And so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.<eos> - Hebrews 12.<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Eight more books, I'm going to have this baby memorized.<eos> How can I be of assistance?<eos> Mr. Bass Reeves.<eos> What about him?<eos> I was going through the rolls and, you know, thinking I would try to find someone.<eos> Scrounge someone up who might be able to assist with the legal fees while we deal with this injunction.<eos> You are something else, you know that?
And if you want my advice, pick a good one.<eos> It'll make everything feel more... legal.<eos> Drop it in the plate.<eos> Well, speaking of legal...<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd better get my ass out of here before Kerissa drives up, right?<eos> What about the law?<eos> Or even God's law?<eos> You're okay with this?<eos> I love you asked that.
Drop it in the plate.<eos> Well, speaking of legal...<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd better get my ass out of here before Kerissa drives up, right?<eos> What about the law?<eos> Or even God's law?<eos> You're okay with this?<eos> I love you asked that.<eos> If you didn't, I'd have my doubts.<eos> Here's my gloss on the matter, and of course you have your own.
I can get you a birthday beer.<eos> No.<eos> Then is it okay if I go?<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> This is my birthday.<eos> You're busy every other day with him.<eos> Can't you just stick with me for this one night?<eos> - I'm not always with him.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> I can't even have a conversation with you for five minutes without you texting him, talking about him, running off.

Well, if you ask Betty Wilcox what the problem is, she'd say the problem is we have a male employee married to another man and flaunting it all over the church and Facebook like it's not a sin.<eos> Carlton?<eos> He didn't even get married at Calvary.<eos> But... Charity sang at his wedding.<eos> And to some, that was a tacit affirmation.<eos> Why didn't they just say that at the meeting?<eos> I asked them.<eos> They would say it to Lady Mae.<eos> So, what was this fight about?<eos> David said you and this boy got into it.
Let me just wipe your brow a little bit.<eos> You were always sweet to me.<eos> I need your help, Daddy.<eos> I guess I do owe you something, don't I?<eos> After all I put you through.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My little yellow daisy.<eos> Daisy Mae.<eos> You know I never could deny you, not when you were sweet to me.
What's going on?<eos> - You!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Stay the hell out of my business, you hear me?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> I told you he was not the problem.<eos> You think you know more about my life now than I do?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - What the hell is she talking about?<eos> Or do you just wanna make sure nobody else gets what you can't have?
You think you know more about my life now than I do?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - What the hell is she talking about?<eos> Or do you just wanna make sure nobody else gets what you can't have?<eos> Maricel, call the police.<eos> No need to call the police.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I just came to have my peace, to say what I had to say.<eos> And I'm really sorry if I'm ruining it for everybody.<eos> If I do, you just do what you do best, Sister Mae.
Maricel, call the police.<eos> No need to call the police.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I just came to have my peace, to say what I had to say.<eos> And I'm really sorry if I'm ruining it for everybody.<eos> If I do, you just do what you do best, Sister Mae.<eos> You just look away.<eos> You get out of my house right now.<eos> 'Cause every night your mama watched my mama beat my ass while your mama stood by and looked the other way.<eos> Well, you had your hell and I had mine. Brand-new dresses all the time, going to Nashville with Daddy...
Just let me be.<eos> Leave me be!<eos> Leave me be, now.<eos> What the hell is this about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I encouraged a bad influence to let your sister be.<eos> - When?<eos> - The other day.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> I can't believe you did that to me.
So, you happy now?<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, daddy.<eos> Now, this just landed in the mail room, And looks like it might be good news.<eos> It is.<eos> It's my cds.<eos> Can I have a look?<eos> Please.<eos> You and mama paid for them.
I want to ask you something.<eos> I've already stuck my neck out enough for you with this judge.<eos> What now?<eos> I need a job.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Get one.<eos> Good advice.<eos> Maybe I'll try the f.E.C.<eos> I reckon they might be hiring.<eos> Well, see, if they don't already have an investigation open. Into how you and your boy raised the finances. For his first campaign, I imagine they will.
What kind of questions?<eos> You don't have to tell me. I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And so what did you tell her?<eos> Just that you've always been nice and nothing else, And that was that.<eos> Should I not have talked to her?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You did good.<eos> I appreciate you telling me.
You ready to lose some money?<eos> Never short on confidence, this guy, is he?<eos> No, that is definitely his gift.<eos> Never tall on size.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Hey, pastor greenleaf.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You all go on ahead.<eos> What's up, fellas?<eos> Looks like you caught the bug.
Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you.<eos> Don't you dare do that.<eos> Mama, please, I just... I feel so powerless. Would you just let me go?<eos> "Powerless"?<eos> Hey!<eos> Yes!<eos> What do you know. From powerless?<eos> When have you ever been prevented. From anything until now...<eos> Or restrained yourself one whit?<eos> Every problem you have, you caused.
"Powerless"?<eos> Hey!<eos> Yes!<eos> What do you know. From powerless?<eos> When have you ever been prevented. From anything until now...<eos> Or restrained yourself one whit?<eos> Every problem you have, you caused.<eos> Every cross you bear, You built it yourself.<eos> You don't know about powerless... What your sister endured, what I endured, What those girls you go around showing off defending endured.<eos> Mama. What? What have you ever endured?
Who is this?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This here... who is it?<eos> You don't need to touch it to read it.<eos> You're not blind, mac.<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's my niece.<eos> Your niece?<eos> Yeah, grace's kid, sophia.<eos> You and she talk, text?
Hi.<eos> There you go.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> I miss you, faith.<eos> And I love you.<eos> Zora, go get your brother ready.<eos> We're gonna be leaving in five.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> Zora, if you don't get up off that couch right now, I promise you...<eos> You try maintaining a lifelike presence online.
You.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stay the hell out of my business, you hear me?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> I told you he was not the problem.<eos> Kevin, I have no idea what is going on with the two of you.<eos> Charity, I've been doing some research.<eos> About what?<eos> What I've been struggling with.<eos> You are what you are.
I can't lose half the deacon board. Over a choir director.<eos> Wasn't he fired from another church?<eos> Two churches.<eos> And he sued them.<eos> And he lost.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> Gigi...<eos> Who's gonna direct the choirs?<eos> I will not debate this with you.<eos> You are the associate pastor.

"What?"<eos> Yeah, so, just, - Just kind of give me a heads up from now on.<eos> Well, if god had given me prior notice, I certainly would've given it to you.<eos> So, you're gonna tell me. You didn't have any plans to do that?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The lord just gave it to me to do, brother, Right then and there, and I did it.<eos> I'm just finding that a little hard to believe.<eos> Pastor greenleaf.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You languished in the shadow of your father. Like some anemic little weed.
I need more help now, not less.<eos> This is so dumb!<eos> And immoral.<eos> No small thing.<eos> Well, no, I understand. Why people like betty think what they think, But it's not very loving.<eos> But can't you just talk to daddy?<eos> One little "but, daddy" from gigi. Usually fixes something like this.<eos> Daddy was sitting right there when mama asked me to fire him.<eos> He's in.<eos> And I actually think you are the only person. Who can stop this from happening.
All righty.<eos> Nice.<eos> Thank you. You're gonna love it.<eos> Come on. I got to show you.<eos> Come on!<eos> So, I actually used to sell real estate. Before I joined basie and the ministry.<eos> And I can tell you that for this neighborhood, This is a very attractive property.<eos> I can imagine it's a little like, "what?"<eos> You know, but basie and I shared a great five years here.<eos> And I know that once you and jacob move in. And make it your own that you're gonna love it. Just like we did.
Fine.<eos> Slow day at church?<eos> Actually, I want to get together and talk about something else, If that's okay.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> As long as I pick the place.<eos> Done.<eos> When I look back now at the way I behaved, I feel like I'm looking at a whole different person.<eos> I think you are.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> Real transformation is the goal, And you achieved that.
It worked.<eos> Cool.<eos> Kevin, how's it going with your wife?<eos> Any chance I'm gonna see her at a meeting. One of these nights?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She still got me staying in a hotel. After nathan was born.<eos> And today, I found out he had a rash. And she didn't even tell me about it.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Look, kevin, I know from experience, brother, Blah.<eos> You probably feel like you're the whole problem. To say the least.

Where you need to step up and lead.

Well, I hope so.<eos> You were driving the corolla.<eos> That was what, our third date?<eos> The night I met your family.<eos> I remember. The bishop was giving me. Some mini-sermon about godly restraint.<eos> And lady mae wanted my entire family genealogy.<eos> Especially after she saw that car.<eos> Do you remember how I broke down. Right when we were trying to leave?<eos> Right at the front gate.<eos> And me and jacob were under the hood. Trying to get it to start again, And you sitting in the front seat.
Why?<eos> I know you're not gonna believe what I've got to say.<eos> Wait, yeah, pop...<eos> You're not gonna let me finish?<eos> Please, just don't.<eos> I don't want to hear any more about your conspiracy theories. About you and basie skanks.<eos> My life's not about you, pop.<eos> It's about me.<eos> Wy. T I know.<eos> And what do you want?
I respect you.<eos> I know you don't like that place, But we're getting out of here.<eos> Good morning, lady mae.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, um, sit over there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Carlton, let me start by saying. What a wonderful addition. Your ministry of music has been here at calvary.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I want you to know. That if you ever need a personal reference from me...
Yours?<eos> No. Life's too short.<eos> Really?<eos> You know you not cooking that chicken this time.<eos> Hey, reggie.<eos> Pastor.<eos> That's a nice car.<eos> What can we do for you, pastor?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Whatever you have to say, You can say in front of him.
Mama, I'm 40 years old... with nothing under my belt to be proud of except my kids.<eos> This is my last shot. I got to take it.<eos> Did you hear anything I just said?<eos> I did.<eos> And... If it's true, then nothing's perfect.<eos> The man has every right to be angry.<eos> There's no place for me at Calvary.<eos> And time's running out.<eos> Now I'm embarrassed.<eos> And the only comfort in all of this is the hope that the debris left behind, all the dreams of mine that you shattered... you and that renegade sister of yours... might make a path that brings me closer to my lord.
I said, is that it?<eos> I can't speak for Zora.<eos> I don't know what she got up to, but, yeah, that's all that happened with me.<eos> So I'm not gonna get a call from Kerissa with more story to tell?<eos> No!<eos> What is the big deal?<eos> Honey, what if Zora or this Isaiah kid got in an accident or something like that?<eos> Nobody would've known where they were.<eos> You can't go covering up for people.<eos> Like you never did the same thing?
I see.<eos> There it is.<eos> Does charity know?<eos> Yes.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just... I don't want to think about it.<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't want you seeing him again.
He's expecting to hear from you very soon.<eos> Danielle can start whenever she's ready.<eos> Thank your sister-in-law for me.<eos> I will.<eos> The kids there, they're nice?<eos> They're kids, but it'll be a fresh start.<eos> Short of moving out of town, it's the best I can offer, and really, wherever she ends up going, she's gonna have to learn how to hold her head up.<eos> If it gets tough, you call me.<eos> And you'll talk to her?<eos> Or you can talk to me.
Fight!<eos> Now, this balcony is the perfect place to unwind with a Bible or take a leisurely breakfast.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah, well, the view isn't as picturesque as the one from the balcony of your family's place in Captiva, I know, but it has its countrified charm.<eos> I'll be out here every morning.<eos> Well, I hope that's true.<eos> Sometimes, I confess, I feel like I'm the only person here who still really appreciates the beauty of this place.<eos> How Jacob was able to leave it behind as a thing of no value is beyond me.<eos> We'll get him back soon enough.<eos> I pray you're right.
Kevin and I are breaking up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know we've been having problems.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> But marriage?<eos> Marriage you can bend.<eos> You can bend it until it's all knotted up like some seaweed from the swamp.<eos> But you break it... break it... and that's a loss.<eos> I don't think we can stay married, Mama.<eos> Well, I'm not saying you should, but I highly recommend that you and Kevin just sit down with your father and me, and talk about it before you make a final decision.
From whatever drama those two cook up.<eos> I mean, listen, you know how messy those things can be.<eos> And, yes, if it comes to it, Kevin.<eos> All right, I'll... I'll check into it, okay?<eos> Hey, little man. I will never leave you.<eos> Then I'll do my spiel. So.<eos> - And then you'll do your vows.<eos> - Great.<eos> And since you chose to write your own, I'll say, "And now the couple has written their own vows", which they will now share."<eos> Preston, you wanna go first?
And, yes, if it comes to it, Kevin.<eos> All right, I'll... I'll check into it, okay?<eos> Hey, little man. I will never leave you.<eos> Then I'll do my spiel.

Well, if you really need one, we'll call one.<eos> But what's the issue now, princess?<eos> Well, the kitchen outlets.<eos> Well, have you tried resetting the breaker?<eos> Yeah, yeah, but now that whole wall is dead.<eos> Have you been running the heater again?<eos> I know you like it all cozy up in here.<eos> I have not been running the heater, but we should be able to have warm air and a refrigerator at the same time.<eos> Okay, well, listen to you, sounding like the Israelites in the desert whining to Moses.<eos> You wanna go back to Egypt, too?
- Basie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Let's go, man. Come on.<eos> No.<eos> Well...<eos> Wait, here. Check this out.<eos> Is that... who's that?<eos> That's my daddy, Darryl James.<eos> Handsome man.<eos> You played baseball, right?
It's not your fault.<eos> All right, I'll talk to Basie about getting DeMarco over here to rewire the house, although, I honestly don't think that this is the right time to be spending on luxuries.<eos> How is having two working outlets in a kitchen a luxury, Tasha?<eos> Well, it's... it's not.<eos> It's just the situation Basie and I are in...<eos> What situation?<eos> I know about that high-rise you guys live in.<eos> - Do all of your outlets work?<eos> - They do.<eos> And, look, I don't need you to yell at me. I'm just trying to explain that...
It's... it's not... it's a mess!<eos> Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Just come over here and sit down, sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - I'll get you some tea.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Considering I've been paying Stan's invoices for all the work he's been doing at your house, whatever you can do to bring this to a hasty conclusion would be appreciated.
- So what you're wiling to offer<eos> - is a whole lot of doodly squat. - It beats 28 days.<eos> The studies that would have to be completed to satisfy that sophistry you just dropped would take 28 days or more, and you know it.<eos> How does it feel now, Pastor?<eos> Can I say something?<eos> It's his permission you need to ask for, Jacob, not mine.<eos> This man's father is dead.<eos> - Don't make this about me.<eos> - Pastor Skanks, please.<eos> When I found out that you, supposedly a man of God, gave the order to burn your own church...
Jacob, it's just...<eos> It's just what?<eos> It's just so childish.<eos> - Childish?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Grace, you left.<eos> Ran away.<eos> You knew what Uncle Mac was doing to Faith, and you left.<eos> So who are you to say anything to anybody?
- Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Grace, you left.<eos> Ran away.<eos> You knew what Uncle Mac was doing to Faith, and you left.<eos> So who are you to say anything to anybody?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - No, I'm sorry.<eos> I never wanted to say that.<eos> But for you to say anything to me besides,
- I'm sorry?<eos> - No, I'm sorry.<eos> I never wanted to say that.<eos> But for you to say anything to me besides,<eos> "Thank you for not hating me after I came home and stole your whole life right out from under you,"<eos> is way out of line.<eos> Neither one of us is exactly where we ought to be. That's life.<eos> But you don't blame people for that.<eos> Check yourself.<eos> Well, not that you need any more commotion after all that donnybrook, but it's been given to me that...
Thank you.<eos> At the tone, record your message.<eos> Aaron... Jeffries, acting general counsel for Calvary Fellowship World...<eos> If you are satisfied with your greeting...<eos> Hey, Kevin, wait up!<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> Hey. So, how you settling in?<eos> - Good, good, thanks.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> Hey, listen, Lady Mae told me that you and Charity might be getting a divorce.
Should we pray for them?<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Let's do it. Let's pray.<eos> I don't think it'll help, honey.<eos> Then... let's pray for you.<eos> Seems like a pastor who doesn't believe in the power of prayer could use some.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Dear God, thank you so much for my mom. She works so hard and fights so hard to do what's right, but she needs some support right now.<eos> Please let her know that You're there for her, waiting whenever she needs you and that no matter what happens...

- I'm fine.<eos> - She's lucky to be alive.<eos> - We don't believe in luck.<eos> - Then she must have her own private angel following her around.<eos> That, I don't doubt.<eos> I had the car towed to Sanderson's, and so Darius came to pick me up.<eos> Well, how gallant of him.<eos> First Lady, Bishop.<eos> Nash.<eos> And you must be Sophia.
Please.<eos> I don't know that I can.<eos> And I really don't know that I should.<eos> Then what's gonna happen?<eos> It is what it is.<eos> What will you do?<eos> I don't know what to say, honey.<eos> I don't want to lie to you or pretend like it's all just over. It's not.<eos> We all have our crosses to bear.<eos> And you're becoming mine.
Then tell that girl to Kumbaya with her friends and figure her out life like a normal teenage girl.<eos> I just said I'll do that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - And don't forget the coat.<eos> - "And don't forget the"...<eos> Here, I'm gonna leave her a message.<eos> I don't want to go into worship with this hanging between us.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> I need you to stop calling.
Yeah, I'm making an exception.<eos> About what?<eos> That thing we talked about? Not gonna happen.<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> I know you did.<eos> But I'm already getting pushback.<eos> I've got plans, and I can't be hampered dragging your sick-looking ass alongside me.<eos> Did she do this?<eos> Did who do what?<eos> You did it to yourself. Followed your demon.
But I'm already getting pushback.<eos> I've got plans, and I can't be hampered dragging your sick-looking ass alongside me.<eos> Did she do this?<eos> Did who do what?<eos> You did it to yourself. Followed your demon.<eos> Now please, lose my number.<eos> Who was that?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who the hell are you to always be asking somebody questions?
You did it to yourself. Followed your demon.<eos> Now please, lose my number.<eos> Who was that?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who the hell are you to always be asking somebody questions?<eos> You've never done anything wrong?<eos> I never said I was perfect.<eos> Perfect?<eos> You are the most bottom shelf, off-brand piece of rotten old ass I've ever laid hands on.
- Don't do that.<eos> - Do what?<eos> You know what you did.<eos> And in front of all them?<eos> - What do you...<eos> - Babe, you asked...<eos> And now you're interrupting me?<eos> You must forgot who I am?<eos> I brought you in that room.<eos> You sit there, you watch.
- I got it.<eos> - Do you got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> All right, let's run it.<eos> Hey, can you come get me?<eos> Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hurry.<eos> So, that's the solution.<eos> We pay the debt. You give us Triumph II.
- Do you got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> All right, let's run it.<eos> Hey, can you come get me?<eos> Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hurry.<eos> So, that's the solution.<eos> We pay the debt. You give us Triumph II.<eos> That way, the money gets replaced, and you don't go to jail.
- Seriously? Yes.<eos> It was a wedding present.<eos> I'm astounded by the depth of the betrayal, the underhanded way you cut me.<eos> - I'm just astounded!<eos> - Basie!<eos> Now, you and I both know you mess with black people's money, they gonna rise up and take it back.<eos> That's the God's truth.<eos> Now, you just stop dreaming.<eos> You let us fill that bank account.<eos> You and Tasha can leave us the deed to the land, and you walk free and clear.

It's a movie.<eos> A good movie.<eos> - Old?<eos> - Not old, classic.<eos> Trust me.<eos> She didn't know where I was, now I don't know where she is.<eos> Karma's a bitch?<eos> She's probably driving and ignored her phone like she's supposed to.<eos> Yeah, she is kind of stunningly well-behaved for a kid who has every right to be an absolute mess.<eos> Seems like you're doing a great job.
It's been...<eos> Just thanks.<eos> Of course.<eos> - I'm sorry about this.<eos> - Stop it, don't be silly.<eos> If she hit traffic, okay, but to... I mean to not pick up her phone.<eos> Are we still waiting on our third?<eos> You know what, no, I'm just gonna order for her.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Why don't you go first?
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.<eos> Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.<eos> But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.<eos> No.<eos> We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.<eos> If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.<eos> With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.<eos> I never properly thanked you for that.<eos> They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.<eos> You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys? I did.
But you didn't serve him long.<eos> You turned against him.<eos> Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.<eos> There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King.<eos> Robert was neither mad nor cruel.<eos> He simply had no interest in being king.<eos> So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.<eos> Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,<eos> Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who...<eos> Before I came to power, you favored my brother.

Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.<eos> What does your lord expect from me?<eos> "The prince who was promised will bring the dawn."<eos> I'm afraid I'm not a prince.<eos> Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.<eos> That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,<eos> "The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."<eos> Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?<eos> No, but I like it better.<eos> And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?<eos> He's a clever man, your Hand.<eos> I've known a great many clever men.<eos> I've outlived them all.<eos> You know why?<eos> I ignored them.<eos> The lords of Westeros are sheep.<eos> Are you a sheep?<eos> No.<eos> You're a dragon.
I will see you when I return.<eos> But you don't know when that will be.<eos> No one knows.<eos> I wish you good fortune.<eos> Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.<eos> Y-you are my weakness.
I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by Archmaester Pylos.<eos> I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and his study of rare diseases.<eos> - Oh, you are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And shall I tell you how he died?<eos> From greyscale.<eos> - The procedure's far too dangerous, which is why it's now forbidden.<eos> Hello.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're Jorah Mormont, the only son of Jeor Mormont.
Sit down.<eos> Who's that for?<eos> This is good.<eos> You think so?<eos> The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.<eos> Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.<eos> Mm, I didn't do that.<eos> You've been making pies?<eos> One or two.<eos> I can't believe you're here.
Ready!<eos> Come on.<eos> Nymeria?<eos> Nymeria, it's me, Arya.<eos> I'm heading north, girl.<eos> Back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come with me.<eos> That's not you.<eos> You can't have them all. It's not fair.
Oh, I see.<eos> Your protector.<eos> So, if someone gets too close to you...<eos> He might have to intervene.<eos> To hold that person back.<eos> Until they've made their intentions known.<eos> Why are you standing all the way over there, then?<eos> A foreign invasion is underway.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> Seems like you don't need a protector.
Your boy Breeland ain't here to protect you.<eos> Go ahead, put hands on me.<eos> Give me an excuse to pay your ass back for that bunkass story you sold.<eos> I'm just trying to do right.<eos> Keeping my job so I could stay on parole.<eos> But y'all seem to keep the thumb on us.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Breeland used my parole as leverage.<eos> Always sweating me when he needed favors.<eos> So you come into the sheriff's department lying on Jesse and Joey? That was a favor?
And can you please explain to the jury why Lieutenant Breeland isn't here to testify to that himself?<eos> He's deceased.<eos> Do you believe Lieutenant Breeland would testify that information if he were here today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I swear I don't understand this.<eos> It's like a damn freeforall for the prosecutor.<eos> Witnesses get to speculate, and I'm not even there or even get a chance to have my attorney...<eos> It'sit's not a trial, it's a hearing.<eos> And you have something most others in your position do not.
We have a racebased justice system rooted in our biases, rooted in our prejudices.<eos> It's that very same system that taught Deputy Beck to be the officer he was revealed to be the day he encountered Jesse Carr.<eos> Great. Popo.<eos> Check this out.<eos> You lost, boy?<eos> No, sir.<eos> These proceedings are about the common sense facts of the case.<eos> What are you doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Why did you pull me over?<eos> 'Cause you don't look right.
We had our first dance here. We did.<eos> It was this close from becoming a barroom brawl.<eos> I don't see any threat of that here now.<eos> Did you really think I was capable of killing Breeland?<eos> It crossed my mind.<eos> That's what you think of me?<eos> I just know how much your daughter means to you and how you'd do anything for her.<eos> But now I know what makes you different than the people we put away.<eos> And what's that?<eos> You want to do good.
- Absolutely.<eos> I want to hear about this new job you got.<eos> Mace said you've just been on TV?<eos> I got to tell you, I think this one's gonna be a game-changer, Pop.<eos> Really?<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Wow, it's Maceo Terry!<eos> - Hey, ladies.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?
You smell good.<eos> What up, Pres?<eos> I thought you were coming by tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, I know, but a signing event popped up.<eos> Whole team's gonna be there if you want to roll, Pops.<eos> Well, now, you know I want to get me a picture with Cam. But your brother and I are about to grab something to eat.<eos> Nah, it's all right if you want to go, Pop.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're more than welcome to come too, if you want.
- I know where he'll be tonight, but you won't be able to find it on any map.<eos> Junior!<eos> Damn.<eos> I know you?<eos> I'm an investigator.<eos> I'm just looking for a conversation.<eos> About what?<eos> How much you get for selling that video of your cousin?<eos> That ain't polite.<eos> Pretty sure you don't respond to polite.
Let me get his head right.<eos> - I'll call you back.<eos> - When I took over this state, unemployment was at nine percent, and I said, "Unacceptable."<eos> Only reason she wanted me there was to show her rich donors she has a D.O.J. prosecutor in her pocket.<eos> Then why accept the invitation?<eos> Because I belong there.<eos> You know, you could make or break the governor's re-election.<eos> So is that what you're doing?<eos> Keeping me close?<eos> You made the first move, so maybe it's you who's keeping me close.
Come on, let me in.<eos> Mace, you got talent, no doubt about that. But I ain't looking to put a ring on it. And I didn't think you were either.<eos> You're playing with me, right?<eos> I'm really not.<eos> Damn, so you really do got issues?<eos> And it ain't so sexy when I'm sober, either.<eos> So I got issues 'cause I don't want to smash twice?<eos> No, whatever, girl, if you want to act like a random groupie chick,<eos> I'm gonna treat you like a random groupie chick.<eos> Kind of hard when you're standing outside my door.
Don't.<eos> Don't even.<eos> I used to hate the dudes who worked security at the roller rink.<eos> We used to drop firecrackers on the floor just to mess with them.<eos> Wait 'til you're married with kids.<eos> You're gonna work two jobs, too.<eos> Yeah, well, she wants to see your best man speech, you know, just time it out.<eos> What?<eos> Anna don't want to see a damn thing.<eos> You want to see it 'cause you're afraid I'm gonna say something dumb.
He's singing about his girlfriend, whooping her ass and going to jail.<eos> Sam, we need to talk about Bible School for Knox.<eos> No.<eos> No. This is what I wanna talk about.<eos> Today, tomorrow, for the rest of my life.<eos> Making this music, finding some way to sell it. Trust to God, I can make us some kind of living at it.<eos> We had a good living, Sam.<eos> In Nashville.<eos> I've got sewing to do.<eos> And you need to get back to work.
I don't have the approval to go that high.<eos> Just one second, huh?<eos> One second.<eos> Colonel, come here.<eos> Take the Columbia deal.<eos> There is no deal.<eos> What?<eos> Now, look, I know the offer at Columbia's better, but, uh, business shouldn't be all about money.<eos> I mean, relationships and loyalty should count, too.<eos> You're always saying what a great rapport you have with Steve here. I mean, who knows if you'd have that with Don Law.
Man, this song, gentlemen, needs to jump out and bite folks in the ass.<eos> What's it about?<eos> My old lady kicked me out.<eos> Well, then I need to feel like you're standin' in the rain, man, you ain't got no place to go.<eos> Am I paying you by the hour or the week?<eos> I'll tell ya what, B, quit playing lead.<eos> You focus on your singin'.<eos> Sax man, you ever played lead on a record before?<eos> Well this here's your time.<eos> Okay, uh, at the top, I want you to take the whole 12 bars and then cut loose with a wail.
Look. You know, the Negroes that got outta here, I mean, the last thing they wanna be reminded about is sweating their asses off in some damn cotton field.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. You keep on slugging.<eos> Becky.<eos> How are you?<eos> Marion, this studio look so nice.<eos> Well, Sam's not here. He's recording a recital at Humes High.<eos> Marion, come sit a moment.<eos> You know Sam had some, uh, personal health, well, mental issues back in Nashville.
What does she want?<eos> Do you want to talk to her?<eos> I can't right now.<eos> Tell her I'll be running late.<eos> It's Sam. He says he's running late.<eos> Isn't he always.<eos> The other night, he...<eos> Well, never mind.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sure you must get going. It's always so wonderful to see you.
The other night, he...<eos> Well, never mind.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sure you must get going. It's always so wonderful to see you.<eos> There is something that I want to say, actually.<eos> I don't understand the music Sam's recording.<eos> I wish I did, but I, I don't.<eos> You really should speak with Sam. He's...<eos> Marion. Please.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I need you to know that I know...
Memphis Recording Service, how may I help you?<eos> - I gotta jump.<eos> - All right.<eos> Yes Mr. Rosen, I'm aware we're in arrears.<eos> Good luck, cuz.<eos> We're good for the bill.<eos> We're expecting some cash coming in today, as a matter of fact and you're at the top of the pile.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I heard it.<eos> Like you said, we got cash comin' in the mail for Joe Hill.

Just get it done.<eos> The penal system's just slavery by another name, enforced through illiteracy.<eos> The Establishment knows that the simplest way for people to liberate themselves is through education.<eos> You give convicts the power of language. You give them...<eos> What?<eos> It's your passion.<eos> It's your passion.<eos> I feel it.<eos> I feel it and I... miss it.<eos> And how are you spending your time?
- By behaving like criminals?<eos> - They're the criminals.<eos> They fit us up, they killed Julian and there's nothing we can do.<eos> We need a soldier who can take the fight to the filth.<eos> - And Dhari knows about...<eos> - We can't fight anything from prison.<eos> I'm not afraid of prison.<eos> Are you?<eos> You don't get to shame me into doing something mental, Jas.<eos> Well, you said...
- Fuck you!<eos> - No...<eos> Jas!<eos> Come on.<eos> Jas...<eos> I'm really sorry about what happened to your friend.<eos> No.<eos> You weren't even at the rally.<eos> You couldn't even show up to support.<eos> You did nothing then.
Do you believe in the afterlife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She seemed pretty sure.<eos> She used to say,<eos> "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?
Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Okay, what?<eos> You rot.<eos> When you die, you rot.<eos> And you're so sure?<eos> Yeah. I mean, it's... It's a fixed system.<eos> Physics doesn't take Sundays off.<eos> So you don't believe in anything?
We're established fact.<eos> We don't change.<eos> We live in the same town that I grew up in, in my dead grandma's shitty house.<eos> You have a shitty job. I have a shitty job.<eos> And I want more.<eos> I would be happy living in a cardboard box under a freeway as long as I was with you.<eos> See, that would represent a failure to me.<eos> I represent failure to you?<eos> Well, no.<eos> I mean, if anything, you're actually too good for me.
Somebody fucked us.<eos> I spoke to Adelstein this morning.<eos> Fuck, I told you not to.<eos> And he told me about the deal.<eos> I'm not taking it.<eos> I would get no more than three years, one and a half served.<eos> You'd get the same.<eos> - No.<eos> - You would get the same, and then we would be back to our lives in a year and a half, maybe less.<eos> You are not going to prison.

Okay?<eos> You asked, but I said yes.<eos> I did it.<eos> I got caught, not you, and that is our luck.<eos> You'll get six years.<eos> Six years.<eos> I will be out in three.<eos> I can take it.<eos> If you're on the other side,<eos> I can make it if you can.
120 hours and you're home.<eos> Everything's okay there, right?<eos> Waiting for the sky to fall is going to cause more bother than the sky actually falling, which it isn't.<eos> Yeah. So nothing's wrong.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Robbie's coming by.<eos> We're planning your surprise party...<eos> Welcome home.<eos> A surprise party?<eos> Which you know nothing about.
I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> I'll leave Audrey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And y...<eos> And you tell Shadow, and they'll be angry, but they will understand.<eos> Or they'll freak out.<eos> I don't care. I'm not doing that.<eos> You're not doing that.
This has to end, and it has to end tonight.<eos> You've been very sweet.<eos> We've been really sweet to each other, so just... let goodbye be sweet as well, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you saying no?<eos> Drive.<eos> I really like this song.<eos> Will you sing it to me?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Who the fuck are you?
Well, I'm not getting in there.<eos> I want to go back.<eos> Already your flesh has been moved, has been cut by the doctors who inspected your organs.<eos> Already your loved ones have selected for you the clothes to shroud your decomposition.<eos> Already you are in the ground.<eos> Tears have fallen for you.<eos> Do I get a say in this?<eos> Death is not a debate.<eos> How many do you think have come before you, all with promises and threats and offers of glory, gold, love?<eos> Who are you to misguide me from my duty?
Yeah, he knows.<eos> I tried to fuck him on your grave.<eos> Seemed only fair.<eos> I'm not proud of myself.<eos> I, I had Robbie buried with his penis, you know, that you... You bit off, shoved up his ass.<eos> I was vulgar.<eos> I'm a vulgar woman.<eos> Anger and grief have... have really just made me vulgar.<eos> I...<eos> Laura, I found out that you and Robbie were dead and having an affair in the same sentence.
Everyone has feelings.<eos> Everyone cares about what they feel. I don't care about what you feel.<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> What do you think about what you did?<eos> I think I did a shitty thing.<eos> I think I fucked you over, but I did not mean to fuck you over.<eos> It wasn't even about you.<eos> Yeah, why would it be?<eos> God, I thought you were my best friend.<eos> Robbie and I had a fight, you'd be the first one to know, and all the time you were fucking him
What do you think about what you did?<eos> I think I did a shitty thing.<eos> I think I fucked you over, but I did not mean to fuck you over.<eos> It wasn't even about you.<eos> Yeah, why would it be?<eos> God, I thought you were my best friend.<eos> Robbie and I had a fight, you'd be the first one to know, and all the time you were fucking him<eos> - behind my back.<eos> - Not all the time. You lied to me about it.<eos> You open your mouth, and lies come spitting out.
Like, a zombie dog?<eos> I'll have my own private sunshine.<eos> Laura, you wiped your ass with that sunshine.<eos> Shadow deserves better than you.<eos> I love Shadow... loved Shadow...<eos> Love Shadow.<eos> I love Shadow.<eos> He's the light of my life.<eos> Ha ha ha ha ha ha!<eos> What? You did not love him when you were alive.
You and Robbie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. There is that.<eos> Uh, there's also the miracle of me sitting here posthumously.<eos> I mean, that's a pretty significant thing for us to discuss, too.<eos> And to appreciate.<eos> I think maybe we should take a moment and do that.<eos> No, no. You rising from the dead?<eos> It's about par for the fucking course since I left prison, okay?<eos> So don't think that anything that you got to say or do, including dying, is going to distract from the subject at hand.
So don't think that anything that you got to say or do, including dying, is going to distract from the subject at hand.<eos> Okay, you want to know about me and Robbie?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - To what degree do you want to know?<eos> I mean, do you want to know everything, or you want to know the broad strokes, so to speak?<eos> Why don't you start telling me?<eos> And I will tell you when to stop.<eos> I wasn't lying when I said that I could wait for you at the time that I said it.<eos> I sort of knew that it had the potential of being a lie, but I was giving myself the benefit of the doubt that there was a version of events where it wouldn't be a lie.<eos> You were in prison, Shadow.
He was fucking with me.<eos> I told him not to fuck with me.<eos> Take a look at you, beating up the wrong guy.<eos> You're a good kid, just not good with people you don't know.<eos> Apologize.<eos> Please pass on my sincerest apologies to Mr. World.<eos> Mr. World doesn't want your apology.<eos> He would, however, like to regift your apology to Wednesday and his man Shadow Moon.<eos> Are you fucking with me right now?<eos> Mr. World expects your apology to be every bit as authentic as if you were apologizing to him directly.
I gave him the wrong coin.<eos> Wasn't meant to be that coin.<eos> That's for royalty, see?<eos> That's a coin you'd give to the King of America himself, not some piss-ant bastard like your piece-of-shit husband.<eos> Just give me my fucking coin back!<eos> No.<eos> You'll never see me again if you do.<eos> I swear to fucking Bran, okay? I swear by the years I spent in the fucking trees.<eos> Give me my coin, cunt!<eos> I'm going to ask you some questions, and I'd like for you to answer me honestly.
Who's after you?<eos> Who's after you!<eos> Someone you don't want to let see your face until you're ready to be seen.<eos> "I Love Lucy"?<eos> How the fuck are you floating?<eos> Happy birthday, Mr. President.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You...<eos> You... You're TV.
He's here.<eos> You have him.<eos> You're letting him go.<eos> You keep letting him go.<eos> I'm giving him opportunity to consider.<eos> Why?<eos> You have him.<eos> Get a yes or kill the goonie cunt.<eos> Bury him upside-down...<eos> This man is older than you will ever be.
Don't fight gravity, Shadow.<eos> We're the coming thing.<eos> They threatened to reprogram reality.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> You are pretending you cannot believe in impossible things.
Yeah, a little.<eos> You know, you're not questioning any of this.<eos> I'm questioning everything right now.<eos> I'm not so young nor so narrow to assume that the dead are dead and there's no spectrum of spectral in between.<eos> In my experience, the dead that aren't rarely come back without purpose.<eos> I don't know what her purpose was.<eos> To let you go.<eos> Now get in.<eos> Now you've seen who's after us, and you know what they're capable of.<eos> You can hang around here if you want, but I'm getting out of here.
Well, you're not taking it anywhere, dead wife, not without me, not until that coin is back in my pocket<eos> - where it belongs. - Good fucking luck with that.<eos> No, this one, not that one.<eos> That alarm I can't do anything about.<eos> This alarm I can.<eos> This alarm's my friend.<eos> Well, then steal me a different fucking car.<eos> I don't want to drive this shitty old taxi.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> You're in the back.
This car's a toilet.<eos> It's your toilet now, dead wife.<eos> I've done the math.<eos> This times that equals you're a cunt, divided by the only way I'm going to get what I need is if you give it to me, equals the only way you're going to give it to me<eos> Like my friend Jesus Christ, the only thing you need, dead wife... is resurrection.<eos> Did you just name drop Jesus Christ like you know a guy who knows a guy?<eos> I do know a guy who knows a guy, and the guy sitting next to that guy is your guy.<eos> And who's this guy your guy knows?<eos> Someone who can perform a resurrection without the use of a charmed coin.<eos> And you're just going to convince this guy to bring me back to life?

Is this you being convincing now?<eos> Because you suck at it, unless you're trying to convince me you're an asshole.<eos> I'm trying to convince you to live.<eos> Real living, not whatever rot living this is.<eos> 'Cause whatever this is doesn't last long, especially through a hot summer.<eos> Whatever this is goes to soup, and soup don't win her husband back, if that's what soup is after.<eos> Why don't you put that on your fucking scales and weigh it?<eos> What the fuck are you?<eos> I mean, what the fuck are any of you?<eos> But first, tell me what the fuck are you.
Coffee, please.<eos> Black.<eos> I'll bring it to your table.<eos> Find a dark corner downwind.<eos> Are you trying to shame me?<eos> That shit will blow up in your face.<eos> Shame is the reason dead people only go out at night.<eos> I have no use for shame.<eos> Shame, I Dream of Genie, is what kept you from gettin' tossed off a roof long enough to make it to America.<eos> And what do you know about dead people?
I have no use for shame.<eos> Shame, I Dream of Genie, is what kept you from gettin' tossed off a roof long enough to make it to America.<eos> And what do you know about dead people?<eos> I had a whole tutorial with the Grim fuckin' Reaper, so I think I know a thing or two.<eos> It's easier to pass for the living in the dark, if I felt a need to pass.<eos> Only thing you're passin' for is dead.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not good.<eos> You don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to yourself.<eos> I think perhaps you don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to myself.
Close your eyes.<eos> Can you see her?<eos> - She's in Indiana.<eos> - Yeah. Outside her mom's big house.<eos> She's out in the cold, but... she doesn't feel it anymore.<eos> Or maybe that's all she feels now.<eos> She's at the window, but... her breath isn't fogging up the glass at all.<eos> She's watching her family.<eos> They can't see her.<eos> But you can see her, Shadow, can't you?
You used to do everything by hand.<eos> Craft.<eos> Not manufacturing.<eos> Now this, this is craft.<eos> You could cut a line of throats with the best blade ever made from now until your grandchildren died, and not spill half the blood a gun could in a day.<eos> They make blood sacrifices to you.<eos> Blood spilled by bullets.<eos> You could use a blood sacrifice.<eos> Why are you doing what you're doing?<eos> You got yours, I just want to make sure everybody else gets theirs.
We need the table.<eos> We got two more coming in the morning.<eos> A woman and a much younger woman.<eos> No call yet.<eos> They pass within the hour.<eos> - Lover's quarrel?<eos> - Overdose.<eos> We get so few lover's quarrels these days.<eos> You want help? Mm-mm.<eos> You have a story to tell.
Christ.<eos> Can a man get a moment alone with his prick?<eos> I think we should let Salim go. No, we should fucking not.<eos> We can make our own way from here.<eos> From here is from nowhere.<eos> I got business after your business.<eos> Pack up the rug, back in the car, we got ground to cover.<eos> We're near enough, we don't need him anymore.<eos> I'm only taking this detour for you.<eos> You and that coin in your belly are the only reasons I'm not driving straight to House On The Rock.
House On The Rock, Wisconsin.<eos> That's where they're going.<eos> That's where they're all gonna be.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I'm releasing him.<eos> You are released from your bargain.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Go find your man.<eos> Your God, your jinn.<eos> You are an unpleasant creature.
Over the following years, Essie became an accomplished shoplifter, her wide skirts capable of concealing a multitude of sins.<eos> Though the work was not honest, she lived by her own labors and owed thanks to no man.<eos> She saved her thanks for the creatures she had been told of as a child whose influence, she was certain, extended as far as London.<eos> Unfortunately, the more abundant the blessings, the more we forget to pray.<eos> "You are charged with returning from transportation and you are charged with theft."<eos> Essie was taken to Newgate Prison where it was only a matter of time until she would face the gallows.<eos> Don't eat what's in the bowl, unless you like shitting yourself dry.<eos> Stick to the bread.<eos> Pretty girl like you don't belong here.<eos> How do you know what I look like?
You've got gold?<eos> Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.<eos> Drank my share but delivered the balance on time where it was meant.<eos> To who?<eos> The King.<eos> We're in prison, love.<eos> All we have to do is tell tales.<eos> You've told your share, I wager.
I know.<eos> What if this don't go our way?<eos> Then I'll keep filing motions, prolong the process, keep stalling this trial till we figure out a way to get him back.<eos> Got a lot of night left.<eos> With a bit of rest. Food in their bellies. We ought to push on.<eos> Well, Valentine's break is bad.<eos> Infection might be settling in.<eos> I figured as much. I told Miss Elizabeth to wire ahead, let 'em know the cargo gonna be light.<eos> Mary can get him some medicine from the hospital, help him heal faster.<eos> I suppose that means you stayin' behind, too.
He gave up his freedom for Boo and me.<eos> He ain't blood.<eos> And hearts change.<eos> I know John hurt you, but this ain't like when you went back for him.<eos> Road you got ahead of you, 600 miles. Deep South.<eos> Stealing yours from the hell you barely escaped, then 600 miles back through enemy territory.<eos> You did it with your kin.<eos> Maryland ain't Georgia.<eos> You got to keep your head straight.<eos> This rescue gonna be the toughest thing you ever done.
Noah, get in, get in!<eos> - Noah!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Let's go, come on!<eos> They're coming!<eos> How'd they get on us so fast?<eos> They don't look like marshals.<eos> Noah!<eos> Death been followin' you all around.<eos> And you thought you could beat it.
- Previously on Underground...<eos> - What you doin' in here?<eos> She was sweeping' floors, but she matched the description of Harriet.<eos> Maybe you think this is your chance to escape.
Then we gonna get his family, and then the house girls out, too, if they willing.<eos> Remember, we are at war.<eos> And as such, we are entitled to the the spoils of it.<eos> Take whatever can help with the cause.<eos> Three hours, that's all the time we got to get back over that river.<eos> You should take someone with you. No.<eos> We need this to be quiet if we're gon' get this baby.<eos> And what if something goes wrong?<eos> Then one man ain't going to help.<eos> You gonna get your moment.
Put it down.<eos> You look like you seen a ghost, house girl.<eos> Guess your man didn't tell you about our little reunion.<eos> Where he at?<eos> - The hell you doing here?<eos> - A bit's happened<eos> - since y'all left me for dead. - Push here.<eos> I made new friends.<eos> And Patty, she got an itch in her drawers for Harriet Tubman.<eos> She seems to think you might be the key to finding her.

I'm meeting today with the provost marshal. To see what their needs may be.<eos> Wagon supplies?<eos> With his approval, we can reopen the warehouse.<eos> You set this meeting without consulting me?<eos> You were still in jail, father.<eos> Well, I'm out of jail now, so I'll see it myself.<eos> Your presence would be problematic.<eos> Problematic?<eos> You're not allowed to run the business. Why?<eos> Because you signed the oath?
And had I no obligations, I would stay with you all day, Tend you and you alone, but...<eos> Yes. Go see your patients.<eos> I shall rest.<eos> Time's up.<eos> They want the room.<eos> Ask me, you don't need to learn nothing.<eos> You know everything there is to about a woman's body.<eos> All right, dr.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Sorry you didn't get a chance to go north.
"whatsoever ye would that man should do to you,<eos> Do ye even so to them.<eos> For this is the law." I was speaking for the fallen hero.<eos> As you would do to others, must be as is done to you.<eos> Would you have yourself made a slave, sir?<eos> You dare to challenge me?<eos> What right have you to interrupt this eulogy?<eos> To falsely sanctify the abomination. Of slavery with holy scripture!<eos> Mother, by what right are wounded shamed for what they believe in? It is wrong, sir!<eos> And what you believe as well?
You have hidden abilities, it seems.
Beautiful illustrations.<eos> Who needs a book when we have the real thing?<eos> Cause of death was indeterminate.<eos> Surely an investigation is justified.<eos> You propose an autopsy?<eos> You've done one before.<eos> In philadelphia, I assisted dr. Berenson.<eos> So shall you assist me.<eos> And you will point out the gaps in my knowledge.<eos> Unless you'd rather be fixing a leak somewhere.
If Gordon dies, it's a weight we'll both have to carry.<eos> I'm used to such burdens.<eos> He'll die by my hand, not yours.<eos> But this is something you'll need to live with.<eos> Can you?<eos> What is that?<eos> Your mother brought it to my house.<eos> Just leave it there. I'll get it later.<eos> Selina... I know how long you've waited to see your mother.<eos> I can't imagine all you must be feeling.
Well, that's just...<eos> Just hilarious. You know...<eos> Really. Thank you. Thank you very much...<eos> I guess I better go.<eos> It's late.<eos> Stay.<eos> Alfred will drive you to your hotel in the morning.<eos> You're very kind.<eos> Mr. Mayor?<eos> Unless you are bringing strong coffee, or you have information on my father's stolen remains... go away.
Mr. Mayor?<eos> Unless you are bringing strong coffee, or you have information on my father's stolen remains... go away.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> The birthday boy.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do such a thing?<eos> What are you talking about? What is that?<eos> You are a sick man!
No, but it makes sense.<eos> Strange was collecting psychopaths, right?<eos> Fish, Galavan.<eos> Jerome fit the bill.<eos> The woman that walked out of the morgue, that was Dwight's trial run.<eos> He's gonna bring back Jerome.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's all this city needs... Jerome Valeska sucking air with 50 fanatics at his back.<eos> Lucius.<eos> If you wanted to bring back someone from one of these, what would be your next step?
Jerome is just the first step.<eos> You think we're a small band.<eos> But we are everywhere.<eos> Put out a citywide call,<eos> I want every unit looking for this symbol. Go, now.<eos> We're almost done loading the vans.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Ding... dong...<eos> And we are... there.<eos> I hope you had a nice sleep.
I ran into some technical difficulties.<eos> Nothing that I can't fix.<eos> Is everything plugged in?<eos> Yes.<eos> Try turning it on and off.<eos> I did! Three times.<eos> Look, you have spent the last year telling everyone that the Prophet would return.<eos> People have made sacrifices for you, Dwight.<eos> I left a really good job at the post office.<eos> The police are coming, and you promised them Jerome.
He never left us.<eos> Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> We are all...<eos> Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> You are Jerome.
Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> We are all...<eos> Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> You are Jerome.<eos> You are Jerome.
Just clean house.<eos> I'm sorry. Just...<eos> Well.<eos> I'm glad you can find the humor in it.<eos> Did you really think<eos> I would be so easy to manipulate?<eos> What was your plan?<eos> Take advantage of me while I was in a weakened state?<eos> Trick me into attacking my subordinates so they truly did rebel?<eos> Inciting war, so that you could pick up the pieces?
How's it going between you and Jimbo?<eos> You still together, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I really liked you guys.<eos> What happened?<eos> He killed my husband on our wedding night.<eos> Glad you find it funny. I do.<eos> I get why you don't.
Goody!<eos> The cult will never follow you, Dwight.<eos> I saw you, at the theater?<eos> You don't have what it takes.<eos> Breathe, James.<eos> I haven't touched a hair on your pretty girlfriend's head.<eos> You're just repeating what Jerome said to me last year.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're the understudy pretending to be the star.
This is the night of the awakening.<eos> This is the night of the awakening.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Did you know?<eos> That she was only after the money.<eos> I-I wasn't sure. Did you know?<eos> !<eos> Yes.<eos> It was obvious.<eos> And you gave her the money anyway?
Ed, who has you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Kane Chemicals.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Oswald, hurry, please.<eos> Ed?<eos> Ed?<eos> Ed?<eos> C-come on. Now. No, Gabe.<eos> Not you. You stay by the phone in case he calls back.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> It's you.<eos> It's really you.<eos> No.<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Penguin.<eos> He killed the librarian.<eos> I don't want to kill him.<eos> I want to destroy him.<eos> And you promised them Jerome.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> I... What is happening?<eos> I...<eos> You weren't kidnapped?<eos> Not unless you count kidnapping yourself.<eos> Recognize it?<eos> Why should you?<eos> I doubt you did the deed yourself.<eos> That car belonged to Isabella.<eos> Ed, whatever you've heard...
I...<eos> You weren't kidnapped?<eos> Not unless you count kidnapping yourself.<eos> Recognize it?<eos> Why should you?<eos> I doubt you did the deed yourself.<eos> That car belonged to Isabella.<eos> Ed, whatever you've heard...<eos> I know it was you, Oswald.<eos> Isabella was my everything, and you took her from me.
He's not one to miss out on the fun, so what does he want?<eos> A puppy?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> I didn't talk to him.<eos> No, but Lee did.<eos> Yes!<eos> But my father appeared to me.<eos> I saw him.<eos> No.<eos> You... saw a man that I met in Indian Hill that does killer impersonations.
And afterward, you would have hated yourself!<eos> Well... we'll never know, will we?<eos> I did it for love.<eos> What?<eos> I did it because I love you.<eos> You should know that.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Love is about sacrifice. It's about putting someone else's needs and happiness before your own.<eos> Ed, please...<eos> 'Cause the truth is, Oswald, you would sacrifice anyone to save your own neck. Even me.
You get the idea.<eos> Ed. Please.<eos> No, please.<eos> I can change.<eos> Say you're right.<eos> Say you're right. I...<eos> The fact that I love you proves that I can change.<eos> Just give me a chance.<eos> You know as well as I that a man facing death will say anything to save his skin.<eos> And you won't change... because you can't.
No, please.<eos> I can change.<eos> Say you're right.<eos> Say you're right. I...<eos> The fact that I love you proves that I can change.<eos> Just give me a chance.<eos> You know as well as I that a man facing death will say anything to save his skin.<eos> And you won't change... because you can't.<eos> Now, I was going to have you say hello to Isabella.<eos> But... I think you... are going... to a very different place.
Speak up.<eos> What are you doing in my house?<eos> Whatever we want.<eos> You're finished, Oswald.<eos> Now, where's Nygma?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Think.<eos> What?<eos> I said think.<eos> I heard you. I'm just surprised you knew the word.
I heard you. I'm just surprised you knew the word.<eos> Speaking of words, any last ones?<eos> Babs said not to kill him until we have Nygma.<eos> I don't work for Barbara Kean.<eos> Stop pretending that you are anything but muscle!<eos> Yes, you used to be someone in Gotham, but those days are past!<eos> Remember when I put a knife in your mom's back?<eos> That was awful, wasn't it?<eos> Her crying, bleeding out.<eos> You just holding her as she died.
!<eos> Give up Nygma, save your own ass.<eos> Live to love another day.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You have a weird look on your face.<eos> Like, weirder than normal.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should want him dead.<eos> "Should"?<eos> Oswald... you loved him, and he betrayed you.
I couldn't.<eos> But I'm ready now.<eos> I won't... call...<eos> I won't let you hurt him!<eos> So you'd rather die than give up the man who tried to kill you?<eos> I would!<eos> Isn't that crazy?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were.
Isn't that crazy?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were.<eos> He didn't give you up after all.<eos> You're in this together.<eos> But why?<eos> Because I didn't want to just take what you had.<eos> I wanted to take what you believed.<eos> I wanted you to die... knowing that you were incapable of loving another person.
It's been a long time.<eos> Ed... I love you.<eos> I know you believe that now.<eos> So you need to listen to me when I tell you by doing this... it will change you.<eos> I've killed before, Oswald.<eos> Not like this.<eos> This won't be a crime of passion or self-preservation.<eos> This will be the cold-blooded murder of someone you love.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> You need me, Edward Nygma.

This will be the cold-blooded murder of someone you love.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> You need me, Edward Nygma.<eos> Just as I need you.<eos> You cannot have one without the other.<eos> You killed Isabella.<eos> The point is...<eos> That is the point!<eos> You can't talk your way out of this, Oswald.<eos> I have wanted you to suffer as I've suffered.
I don't love you.<eos> You need me, Edward Nygma.<eos> Just as I need you.<eos> You cannot have one without the other.<eos> You killed Isabella.<eos> The point is...<eos> That is the point!<eos> You can't talk your way out of this, Oswald.<eos> I have wanted you to suffer as I've suffered.<eos> You killed her, so you die.
You were nothing.<eos> I created Edward Nygma.<eos> And I am the only one in the world who truly sees you as you are.<eos> Who you can still become.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> Ed, are you listening to me?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Say something.<eos> I loved her, Oswald.<eos> And you killed her.
You're only part of the plan.<eos> You know what must happen if he refuses.<eos> No one refuses the Court.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> It's the same thing.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But telling you your mother was a con artist who'd only sought you out for the purposes of getting money from me didn't seem like a very attractive alternative.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> You need me, Edward Nygma!

And then there are your extracurricular activities.<eos> How many are we up to now?<eos> Five?<eos> Six?<eos> There was the curator, the writer... pretentious ass.<eos> So frustrating.<eos> They all fit the profile...<eos> High I.Q., driven, creative.<eos> Yet each one failed.<eos> You must be the first person in history to go on a killing spree in order to find a life coach.
* By making this...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> One more time.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> "Six masters passed."<eos> That could be the six murders.<eos> I told you...<eos> Harvey, the killer's sending Gordon a clue.<eos> He's gonna kill again.<eos> Okay, say you're right.
Like I had a choice?<eos> Oh, you'll thank me.<eos> This is gonna be electrifying.<eos> Knight to Queen 3. Mate in two. Shh!<eos> Quiet, please. Oh, honestly.<eos> They call anyone a grandmaster these days.<eos> Can we discuss why you're doing this?<eos> I've told you why.<eos> The real reason.<eos> See, Ed, the trouble with talking to projections of your psyche... And you of all people should know this... Is that they know everything you know.
Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> But I need to know that you trust me.<eos> You're family. Course I trust you.<eos> Did you ever do something you thought was right at the time, but would now give your life to do over?<eos> Yes.<eos> Looking back, I've done too many terrible things like that.<eos> But the worst was break from your father.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> I loved my brother Peter dearly.<eos> And you're my brother's son.
The Court was once a mechanism devoted to maintaining balance in Gotham.<eos> But time and power have corrupted them.<eos> If it's so secret, how do you know about them?<eos> Your father and I were both members.<eos> I still am a member.<eos> Is that so? The Court doesn't mean you any harm.<eos> They have the highest regard for you.<eos> In fact, they want you to become a member.<eos> Peters, we got a tip from a guy who electrocuted a bunch of players at a fancy chess tournament, pointing us to a pawn on queens.<eos> Now, here, you work at a pawn shop on Queens Avenue. Coincidence?
Have you seen my badge?<eos> The Chess Killer.<eos> How terrifying.<eos> How will anyone sleep knowing the Chess Killer's on the loose?<eos> It's just a name dreamed up by some hack.<eos> Today will change everything.<eos> This is a mistake, what you're doing.<eos> I don't recall asking you.<eos> I showed you how to be Ed Nygma, a man who could run the underworld and operate in plain sight.<eos> What you are planning is madness.
"Will I ever be loved?" "Who am I?"<eos> Although most people try to answer the question in a logical fashion, while... others...<eos> Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge inside a dead body. What does that mean?<eos> Means I know who the next target is.<eos> Thank you, Doctor. Uh...<eos> Thank you, Doctor. Sorry.<eos> I know. Thank you.<eos> "As you take the badge today, approach Gotham as you would... "a cut of prime rib.<eos> "Have a plan, don't be afraid, and have plenty of antacids on hand in case of indigestion."<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
Nygma.<eos> Hello.<eos> Only one person refers to me as Foxy.<eos> I have gassed a room full of folks with a deadly toxin.<eos> I cordially invite you to come upstairs and play a game with me for the antidote.<eos> This is game between me and you.<eos> Come upstairs alone, or the cadets and Bullock die.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Well, look who it is.<eos> I'm so glad you decided to play.
A snowflake.<eos> A sn...<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> The answer is an individual!<eos> Wait!<eos> Snowflake is also a suitable answer.<eos> No two are alike, making them by definition individuals... Therefore an answer befitting your riddle.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't think you grasp how this works.
Hello, Foxy.<eos> So, the antidote around Bullock's neck, that turned out to be grape juice.<eos> Plain old knockout gas.<eos> Why the charade?<eos> Well, the point wasn't to kill a bunch of cops.<eos> The point was to have you play my game.<eos> But you killed Penguin, and you killed Professor Dyson and the others.<eos> Why?<eos> Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?<eos> I'm not sure what you mean.
Except Penguin?<eos> Except Oswald.<eos> So, why did you kill him?<eos> Because Oswald killed the woman I loved.<eos> And with Oswald gone, is that the role I'm meant to fill?<eos> To be your reflection?<eos> No.<eos> Because I know who I am.<eos> I know how to be him.<eos> And you helped that.
I... I just... killed the best friend that I have ever had.<eos> My search for a teacher or an enemy... that was just me trying to hold onto him for a little bit longer.<eos> But now I know who I am... without him.<eos> So, who are you now?<eos> Oh, come on, Foxy.<eos> I'm the Riddler.<eos> I've always loved the view from here.<eos> Not really a fan.<eos> You understand why.<eos> I want you to know that our friendship meant something to me.
He was convicted of vehicular manslaughter.<eos> Got six years.<eos> Then got his ticket punched in a prison stabbing a few months in.<eos> Silver lining.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I pulled his medical file from Blackgate, found something that wasn't in the original case file.<eos> He had "chronic persistent hepatitis."<eos> I was gonna ask Lee what it was when she got in.<eos> Chronic persistent hepatitis is a non-progressive form of liver inflammation.<eos> How do you know that?
And some of them helped save your life.<eos> It's broth.<eos> I even put in some white willow for your fever.<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - For the millionth time, I need to get back to Gotham!<eos> What's the rush? !<eos> I was betrayed and shot.<eos> I should be plotting my revenge, building an army, not drinking pinecone juice with the... crazy plant lady.<eos> So build an army. No one's stopping you.<eos> And I could even help if you weren't being such a jerk.
I wish I could do that.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hey.<eos> That driver that hit and killed your father that night was a career scumbag.<eos> What'd you find out?<eos> He did a stretch for grand theft auto, among other things, and get this... the high-priced lawyer who got him his plea was paid for by none other than Carmine Falcone.<eos> Okay, that's... easy.<eos> Okay. Okay, that's enough.<eos> Oh, Boss, I can't believe it.<eos> You know that everyone thinks you're dead.
- And that Barbara's running things?<eos> Gabe, this might go faster if you just listen.<eos> I need to build an army to exact my revenge, and to take back my throne.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> When the guys hear that you're still alive, they'll come running.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> That.<eos> I want you to do that, Gabe.
I do not trust you.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> My men are on their way.<eos> You trust him?<eos> But I...<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> Friends.<eos> You're being serious.<eos> Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you are a bit of a freak.
You can speak in cryptic riddles all you want.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> But you are scared of something, aren't you?<eos> Sit.<eos> Let me show you what I have to offer.<eos> You have some nerve showing up here.<eos> We need to talk. Alone.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> You took my son from me.<eos> And you took my father away from me.
Yes.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Who ordered the hit on my father?<eos> I want a name.<eos> Frank Gordon.<eos> Your uncle.<eos> Hello, Jim.<eos> Thought we could use a drink.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Did you order the hit on my father?
The mind can do far more than recall memories.<eos> If one knows how, you can experience them, relive them as if they were happening for the first time.<eos> You're saying we were inside my mind?<eos> One is always inside their own mind.<eos> Pretending we are separate from it, that is the falsehood.<eos> Why would you show me that?<eos> Why would you take me back there?<eos> You've never left that alley, Bruce.<eos> Not really.<eos> And for you to be able to accept what it is I have to teach, you need to.
I-I swear,<eos> I didn't tell her nothin'!<eos> Make sure you get him from all sides.<eos> Potential bidders need to know that he's alive and well.<eos> Once we get these delivered, the auction can begin.<eos> Forgot these in the car.<eos> Cannolis from Alberto's, boss. Thank God.<eos> I'm starved.<eos> Alberto's are my favorite...<eos> Looks like you got yourself into quite the pickle.
Oh, no.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Totally fine.<eos> If you have a plan, tell me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What? You want me to beg?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I want you to be nice to me.
He would have been so proud of you.<eos> No!<eos> Please! Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Just please don't make me go back there!<eos> Give me your money!<eos> No!<eos> I have so much to teach you, Bruce.<eos> But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.
No!<eos> Please! Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Just please don't make me go back there!<eos> Give me your money!<eos> No!<eos> I have so much to teach you, Bruce.<eos> But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.

If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.<eos> And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.<eos> Very much.<eos> Which is where you come in.

Very much.<eos> Which is where you come in.<eos> Gotham needs something I believe only you can provide.<eos> What?<eos> A protector, Bruce.<eos> I can't protect Gotham.<eos> Not by myself.<eos> No one can.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But if you were to become a symbol, a symbol against fear, then Gotham can be reborn.
Captain Barnes being escorted away by the orderlies.<eos> Oh, who is this new player that enters the fray?<eos> And with that, it was over.<eos> Leaving me to wonder what mysterious forces are at play in the middle of the night.<eos> Captain Barnes.<eos> At last we meet.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Let's just say I'm a fan.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, for Gotham to be judged and the guilty punished.
Look, I know you're upset.<eos> After everything you've been through...<eos> D-Don't.<eos> Don't you dare do that.<eos> - This is not about Mario.<eos> - Then what's it about?<eos> Why are, why are you here?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Harvey, you are acting captain.<eos> I want you to open an investigation into the murder of Frank Gordon, and I think Jim should be questioned.
You've weaponized the virus.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> No.<eos> You win, and you go free.<eos> Pick up the stick, and defeat this man.<eos> You're lying!<eos> This is just another way of manipulating me.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Prove me wrong.<eos> All that pain and anger... you think it's strength.
I searched the Court chambers.<eos> She isn't taking any chances with the rank and file knowing what the weapon is.<eos> If there is something to find,<eos> - it'll be at her house.<eos> - That's a big risk.<eos> You get caught, ball game over.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Listen, Jim, about your uncle...<eos> Lee came into my office wanting to open an investigation into his death.<eos> She asked me point blank what you were doing.
- Thanks, Harvey.<eos> - Jim, be careful.<eos> Oswald.<eos> Hello, Jim.<eos> Guess I shouldn't be surprised you're still alive.<eos> Yes, I am quite hard to kill.<eos> I take it this isn't a social call.<eos> I'm looking for Ed.<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> And it turns out you are the last one who saw him.
I'm looking for Ed.<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> And it turns out you are the last one who saw him.<eos> Yeah, before he escaped police custody.<eos> "Escaped"?<eos> From the great Detective Gordon?<eos> I think not.<eos> Ed went on television demanding information about a group that runs Gotham.<eos> A group called the "Court."<eos> And you called him and said you had that information.

What if he's yanking our chain?<eos> What stops him from picking up the phone and calling the owl brigade - the second we walk out that door?<eos> - My research.<eos> And a vial of my virus compound which I secreted away, unbeknownst to my captors.<eos> A token of goodwill, which I hope will be remembered when the time comes.<eos> Goodwill?<eos> You're playing both sides.<eos> You help us take down the Court and what?<eos> We cut you a deal?<eos> But we fail, and you appear to be loyal to the Court, is that it?
Yes.<eos> See what you can accomplish once you remove destructive emotions?<eos> Tell me, how did you feel when you were fighting this time?<eos> I felt nothing.<eos> I beat him.<eos> Does that mean I can leave?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> The pain to go away?<eos> I can take it away, Bruce.<eos> I can take it away and you can return to Gotham with a power you never thought possible.
Does that mean I can leave?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> The pain to go away?<eos> I can take it away, Bruce.<eos> I can take it away and you can return to Gotham with a power you never thought possible.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> Get up.<eos> We're not done.<eos> James.<eos> Glad you could make it.
For the Alice Tetch virus.<eos> So that's what you meant by showing Gotham - its darkest self.<eos> - Precisely.<eos> Infecting 200 people won't change anything.<eos> True. But the virus compound only lives in aerated form for a matter of minutes, so, in a closed space like the room below, it will be contained to our guests.<eos> But in an open space, the radius of infection is a half mile.<eos> This is merely a test.<eos> Place it in the middle of the room.<eos> Don't worry, you'll be safe up here.<eos> I need to trust that you're ready to make the difficult decisions when the time comes.
To Wayne Manor.<eos> To kill someone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Well, actually, I'm resigning, and then I'm leaving.<eos> Don't.<eos> You belong here.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> Then you infected this place and everyone around you.
I thought I did.<eos> Then you infected this place and everyone around you.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I am done with you, with the GCPD... with Gotham.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You've taken everything away from me.<eos> Everything.<eos> There's nothing left.<eos> And for what?<eos> I would ask you for the truth, but I honestly don't even think you know what that is anymore.
Because Jervis Tetch wanted to punish you.<eos> You!<eos> Not Mario. Mario didn't deserve what happened to him.<eos> You want to blame me for Mario's death, fine!<eos> You want to walk out that door and never come back, I can't stop you.<eos> But it will not help.<eos> Believe me.<eos> The other day, you asked me at Mario's grave how I could walk away.<eos> Move on.<eos> I guess you know how.
You cannot do this to me.<eos> I demand to speak to the person in charge!<eos> Oswald.<eos> You're alive?<eos> I want to apologize for my curt behavior earlier.<eos> We both want the same thing for Gotham.<eos> Judgment.<eos> But I have just discovered someone I thought was loyal has been deceiving me from the start.<eos> Detective James Gordon now threatens to undo what we both seek.<eos> I need you to kill him before he can do that.
I'm dying, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The process that brought you into this world was flawed.<eos> Will I die before Bruce returns?<eos> No, Bruce Wayne will be back in Gotham well before then.<eos> I know we've asked a lot of you.<eos> After Indian Hill I didn't know what to do or where to go.<eos> You gave me a purpose.<eos> That's more than most people could say. I'm glad you see it that way.
Paging Detective James Gordon.<eos> Paging Detective James Gordon.<eos> Where's that coming from?<eos> Communications room.<eos> Second floor. It's a trap.<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> Stay here.<eos> So, Jimbo, I know you must be wondering what I want from that ding-dong Aubrey James.<eos> Well... turns out, he has answers to a riddle, one that you put into motion when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.
Lee, now is not a good time.<eos> Your uncle's autopsy.<eos> Ballistics came back negative.<eos> No match. But there were microscopic tears along the entry wound, made postmortem.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another one.<eos> It's an old mob trick to cover up a murder.<eos> You're reaching, Lee.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And I think you know what happened.
What are you saying?<eos> Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another one.<eos> It's an old mob trick to cover up a murder.<eos> You're reaching, Lee.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And I think you know what happened.<eos> Listen to me. You need to drop this. You could get yourself hurt.<eos> You think I care what happens to me?<eos> I am sick of watching you destroy people's lives and get away with it.<eos> When I find out what you did, I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.
Then let Mayor James go.<eos> Take a ride with me. But if you pull that trigger, you'll never get the answer you're looking for.<eos> You fool me once, Jim, shame on you.<eos> You fool me twice... well, that's just not gonna happen.<eos> Then the riddle will go unsolved.<eos> Fine!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> So, this limo pulls up literally out of nowhere, and this creepy lady tells you to get in because "you could be so much more"?<eos> And you did?
Previously on Gotham...<eos> Mario could've really lived a normal life.<eos> Jim didn't have to kill him.<eos> James Gordon is one of them.<eos> When I get out of here, he'll be the first that I judge.<eos> Now the Court's readying a weapon that could destroy the city.<eos> It's the virus.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> I have just discovered someone has been deceiving me.<eos> I need you to kill him.
Lee.<eos> Lee.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Mario.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was having the worst dream.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> God, there was this virus that was loose in the city.<eos> It brought out a person's darkness, whatever they had buried inside and you had it.
I told you not to call me that.<eos> What?<eos> Edward?<eos> But that's your name, Edward.<eos> Edward.<eos> Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward...<eos> Enough!<eos> You're pathetic, you know that?<eos> At least I'm in here because I was trying to figure out who runs Gotham.<eos> You're here because what?
Who else have you brought into your confidence?<eos> Harvey Bullock, obviously.<eos> What is this, an exit interview?<eos> If you like.<eos> Who else have you spoken to?<eos> Who else have you spoken to?<eos> The Court ordered my father murdered.<eos> You drove my uncle to suicide.<eos> You can go to hell.<eos> And what are you now, their lapdog?
Good memory.<eos> Well, I saw the way that you looked at James Gordon.<eos> You loved him.<eos> And that love doomed Mario.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense!<eos> Jim Gordon does not deserve love!<eos> Jim Gordon does not get love!<eos> I infect your husband.<eos> You blame Jim.
Your love for him becomes hate.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> And it worked.<eos> But you know the funny thing?<eos> There's poor Mario, cold in the ground... and here you are, blaming Jim, even blaming me, but guess who's really to blame?<eos> I am.<eos> Now, see, that's funny.<eos> My lockpick was confiscated!<eos> Now we're both stuck in this unnaturally damp hellhole.<eos> I hope you're happy.
Did the guards club you?<eos> You know they did.<eos> Then I'm happy.<eos> Why are our captors keeping us here, anyway?<eos> - Why not simply kill us?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Since my first meeting... with some woman named Kathryn, I've had no contact with upper management.<eos> But... according to the guards' gossip, Court's planning some attack on the city.<eos> Fine.<eos> You want to kill me, I want to kill you.
We have to escape.<eos> There's only one way that's gonna happen.<eos> We work together.<eos> There have to be rules.<eos> No sabotage.<eos> Of course.<eos> And no murder on the premises.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Also, there needs to be a sixhour window, postescape.<eos> If I get outside and I'm worrying about you stabbing my neck, I won't be able to concentrate, and that's not good.
I don't know.<eos> Could be several days, several weeks.<eos> Weeks?<eos> How can the kid be missing for weeks?<eos> That's your one freaking job.<eos> Don't you think I know that?<eos> They replaced him, all right?<eos> With a... with an exact clone, created in Indian Hill.<eos> HHold on a second.<eos> Wait, back up, II thought I heard you say "Clone."
Don't you think I know that?<eos> They replaced him, all right?<eos> With a... with an exact clone, created in Indian Hill.<eos> HHold on a second.<eos> Wait, back up, II thought I heard you say "Clone."<eos> That's 'cause I did.<eos> I got to sit down.<eos> All right. Let's think this through.<eos> Alfred.<eos> Is there anything you and Bruce could've done that would've drawn attention from the Court?
I suppose I really shouldn't be surprised.<eos> No, you shouldn't.<eos> Put her in the box.<eos> I've seen the map.<eos> I know the Court has secret locations across the city.<eos> Where are you hiding the bomb?<eos> What bomb?<eos> What does Bruce Wayne have to do with all of this?<eos> Why did you kidnap him?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, Cap.<eos> Captain!<eos> Captain, stop this nonsense and take me out of here now!<eos> Nonsense?<eos> Nonsense?<eos> This is justice.<eos> No!<eos> Barnes!<eos> It's fitting, Jim.<eos> That you should meet your end here.
This is justice.<eos> No!<eos> Barnes!<eos> It's fitting, Jim.<eos> That you should meet your end here.<eos> The word will go out.<eos> No one will escape from the executioner's blade.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> You will face judgment.
You will be judged!<eos> You know what, Captain?<eos> This place is a church.<eos> Mine.<eos> Our agreement still holds for five hours.<eos> I am aware.<eos> How do you expect to win, Oswald?<eos> Barbara Kean runs the underworld.<eos> We have the gangs.<eos> You have... yourself.
It's just bad timing.<eos> And if I had heard I wouldn't have come.<eos> I'm done with this place.<eos> So you keep saying.<eos> You know, Barnes loved the GCPD.<eos> But today he tried to destroy it.<eos> It was the virus.<eos> Or maybe he finally discovered the truth:<eos> There is no justice here.<eos> Look at you... you still haven't paid for the pain that you've caused.
What I did to you, the Court has done with them for 200 years.<eos> But the process does more than remove all feeling.<eos> Cut off the smallest finger of your left hand.<eos> Shall I tell him to eat it?<eos> He will, if I say so.<eos> Bandage that.<eos> You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories can scar us, but it also defines us.<eos> Take away that pain and your mind becomes clay for me to mold.<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> We will destroy the Court of Owls. And in so doing, you will become the perfect weapon.

- He's not Bruce!<eos> Where is Bruce?<eos> Bruce is serving a greater purpose.<eos> We found another owl.<eos> We think this map indicates the secret hideouts of the Court.<eos> James Gordon.<eos> You loved him, and that love doomed Mario.<eos> - But guess who's really to blame?<eos> - I am.<eos> We will destroy the Court of Owls and then you will do whatever I say.
I said, Oswald Cobblepot is alive.<eos> He's lying.<eos> I wish that were true.<eos> He disappeared for days, and then he shows up with some insane story about him and Penguin being trapped in bird cages and escaping together?<eos> - What'd you say you used, pudding?<eos> - Red Jell-O.<eos> How stupid do you think we are?<eos> You really want me to answer that?<eos> It's a setup.<eos> Well, you would know, being an expert in betrayal.
It is good to see you again.<eos> Hello, Professor.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> He's completely docile.<eos> I'd like to hear your techniques, sensei.<eos> One day, Professor.<eos> Show me the weapon.<eos> I told you, Bruce, that I did not serve the Court.<eos> I... we made use of the Court for our own ends.<eos> The one I serve believes you have a great destiny.
Please be very careful with this.<eos> GCPD!<eos> Nobody...<eos> Go get Bruce!<eos> Don't move a muscle.<eos> Obviously, I surrender.<eos> You know where to take it.<eos> Bruce!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> So you're the top boy, are you?
Oh, thank God.<eos> So you're the top boy, are you?<eos> The leader?<eos> Step away from Bruce, or I swear to God I will shoot you straight in the face.<eos> You had best put down the weapon, Mr. Pennyworth.<eos> Not bloody likely, mate.<eos> Bruce?<eos> Bruce, get out of the light.<eos> No, Alfred.<eos> I will not let you hurt him.
- How you been?<eos> - Well, let's see.<eos> I was alive... and then I was dead.<eos> And then I was alive.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Now, this is quite a gathering. You have to love Gotham.<eos> People always pointing guns at each other.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You... shall... see.

Bruce, don't.<eos> I won't have him turn you into a murderer.<eos> This is an emergency.<eos> Please proceed to the nearest exit.<eos> Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> We'll reverse what he's done to you.<eos> Bruce, if you press that detonator, there's no coming back.<eos> He won't shoot you.<eos> He's weak, Bruce, but you are not.

And then, I was alive.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing... is impossible.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> My little Penguin and I will be leaving.<eos> This detonator will trigger the bomb.<eos> Thousands will be infected with the virus.<eos> Let Gotham fall so you may rise.<eos> I won't have him turn you into a murderer.<eos> No. You will press it!
I mean, from what you said, you killed his mentor or something.<eos> He might be a bit peeved.<eos> Listen, whatever they did to him, that is Bruce Wayne in there.<eos> That boy is stronger than you can possibly imagine.<eos> I just need to make him remember... who he is.<eos> As long as he doesn't leave the precinct.<eos> Harvey, something you need to see.<eos> An antidote?<eos> Lucius, I could kiss your face.<eos> Before you do that, I don't actually have the formula.
I need horror.<eos> They're responsible for all of this, aren't they?<eos> At the behest of the Court, I weaponized a virus that releases a person's darkest urges.<eos> Thousands have been infected.<eos> So where is this virus?<eos> I know there's more.<eos> It has all been used.<eos> Please, I must go.<eos> Don't.<eos> You will give me the virus, you will make me the army you promised, you will do everything I say until this city is in the palm of my hand.
I know how you're feeling.<eos> All that blood rushing through your veins, your heart beating faster and faster.<eos> Listen to me, you need to turn yourself in; It's not safe.<eos> The infected are being killed all over the city.<eos> Wow, you're really fighting this?<eos> You know, you don't have to.<eos> The cage is finally open, Jim.<eos> You're free.<eos> - No.<eos> - I thought you loved me.
Killer.<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> I wonder what they're saying.<eos> That you like hurting people, killing people?<eos> Killer.<eos> See how well I know you, Jim.<eos> Now I'm gonna go have some fun.<eos> We'll catch up soon.<eos> Promise.<eos> Killer... killer... you're a killer.
Someone spotted Strange.<eos> Just don't shoot any innocent bystanders.<eos> Or me.<eos> Especially me.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Fish?<eos> What a surprise.<eos> My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> We just want Strange. You can walk away.
Two lumps, just how you like it.<eos> You hungry, mate?<eos> Can I whip you up a sandwich?<eos> Anyway, if all goes well, we should be able to head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.<eos> Although, I was thinking that we could go abroad.<eos> We could go to Switzerland.<eos> I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.
The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.<eos> Let me tell you something, Master Bruce:<eos> That man lied to you.<eos> Him and his bloody Court of Owls, they tried to use you, they tried to manipulate you.<eos> You say he was a liar.<eos> How?<eos> By taking away the pain I've carried for years?<eos> By giving me revenge against the people who killed my mother and father?<eos> That's more than you ever did.
What do you mean?<eos> Whowho's coming?<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I should cook him.<eos> - They want him alive.<eos> So I'll just cook part of him.<eos> No, my dear.<eos> - Let's be calm.<eos> - You don't have that kind of control.<eos> And you do?
We're partners.<eos> But you tried to kill her.<eos> And she forgave me. I know.<eos> Surprised me, too.<eos> But, Mooney is not the old Mooney.<eos> She has evolved.<eos> And she has a vision for Gotham.<eos> She sees a city where people like myself,<eos> Victor, Bridgit... freaks... are in charge.<eos> And you are gonna help us achieve that.
Find Bullock, let him know where we are.<eos> I'm gonna follow Bruce.<eos> I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Who do you think told the Sensei to send you here?<eos> He's dead.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> He died.<eos> But he completed his task.<eos> The Court of Owls is destroyed, Gotham burns, and you... are here.
But he completed his task.<eos> The Court of Owls is destroyed, Gotham burns, and you... are here.<eos> He told me to complete my training, to find the demon's head.<eos> You already have, Bruce.<eos> I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.<eos> That you would complete my training.
I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.<eos> That you would complete my training.<eos> And did the Sensei tell you who I am, what I seek?<eos> I know you are not a part of the Court of Owls, that you only used them.<eos> But I don't know why.<eos> Then know that I have been alive more years than you can imagine.
Local law enforcement is thus far...<eos> Lee.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Why?<eos> You miss me?<eos> The city's not safe.<eos> Well, that's why I'm packing a bag.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm leaving Gotham.<eos> And I want you to come with me.
You and the ex are infected?<eos> I've heard Lee wants to remove my pretty little head from my body.<eos> Is it weird that kind of makes me like her?<eos> You thinking about ripping anyone's head off, Jim?<eos> I bet you are.<eos> You're so close.<eos> The next time you give in, the virus will have you.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Jim!<eos> Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I was getting lonely.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We ran into a police blockade.<eos> Had to hunker down a minute.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sort of improvising here. Why?<eos> You have someplace you have to be?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I imagine you're planning on dragging this out.
There are so few moments of pure joy in one's life,<eos> I feel compelled to savor this one.<eos> You mean gloat?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It was always one of your least attractive qualities, Oswald.<eos> It's killing you, isn't it?<eos> What?<eos> To know that you are not as smart as you think you are.<eos> All of that planning to drive me crazy, strip me of everything I had, revealing yourself with a "tada," and shooting me by the river.<eos> That plan was perfect... and you know it.
We both know that's not what I want.<eos> I want you.<eos> I want you and all your darkness.<eos> Give in.<eos> Give in to your darkness.<eos> Be free.<eos> Don't you get tired of making the same mistake over and over?<eos> You think I'm making a mistake?<eos> Instead of killing me when you had the chance, you've decided to feed your ego.<eos> You want to talk ego?
Any last words?<eos> I'm fine for now.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I'm going to kill you, Oswald.<eos> There is no later.<eos> If you have something to say... now is the time.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm not letting you ruin this for me.

The Iceberg Lounge.<eos> Clever. 'Cause you're nicknamed Penguin, right?<eos> There's that.<eos> And then... there's the club's centerpiece attraction.<eos> Lee?<eos> Lee?<eos> Jim...<eos> I knew if I saw you, I might not have the courage to leave.<eos> And I need to.<eos> I finally understand Gotham in a way I suspect you always have.
- Which will put out the fire.<eos> - Help me! When I say so, open the door, all right?<eos> Now.<eos> Flash, thanks.<eos> Two of 'em.<eos> Man, that was so dope.<eos> How do you stay so calm?<eos> You're like scary calm in the middle of a fight.<eos> It's just experience, Wally.<eos> That's why it's important for you to shadow me for a while, and try to learn everything I know.
You know, what Savitar did...<eos> forcing you to hurt people...<eos> Savitar was controlling me, okay?<eos> As far as I'm concerned, my conscience is clear.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why the Zolpidem?<eos> Are you having trouble sleeping?<eos> Why don't we stop playing games, Dr. Snow, and you tell me what you actually came for rather than accusing me of having insomnia?<eos> I actually need your help.<eos> How can I help you? Well, you're the world's foremost specialist - on meta-humans...
Look. What Alchemy did was not your fault.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell that to Dave Frieman, Ben Edwards, Jorge Gonzales.<eos> These men were part of the CCPD task force that Savitar murdered.<eos> I should've died, not them. Julian, what you're feeling, it's completely normal.<eos> It's called survivor's guilt.<eos> But it wasn't your fault, okay?<eos> You're a victim too.<eos> I tortured people and nearly killed my best friends.<eos> I didn't ask for these powers, just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.
No, my best seller... hey,<eos> "The Future Ain't What It Used to Be"... that was... it was all about... it was all about this guy who's actively trying to prevent his own murder.<eos> Won the Nebula Award.<eos> It's well-received. - Wow.<eos> - Yeah. Um, so this character... your character... was he able to change his future?<eos> More specifically, if he allowed certain events to occur naturally, was he only cementing the very timeline that resulted in a horrible event later?<eos> There were two schools of thought. One faction... one group of fans... they believed, you know, the future's ever-changing.<eos> You know, it's not fixed, and so you could make of the future anything you wish.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Another group of fans vehemently disagreed with it. They said, "No, no, no." "The future is fixed, and you can't change it no matter how hard you try."

That's it. - Whoa.<eos> - That's it!<eos> Barry, ease up. Wally just saved your life.<eos> I'm sorry, Wally, but if you can't learn to follow orders, this deal between us, it's over.<eos> Okay. Who's ready for... man.<eos> Wallace, B.A., you're supposed to be dressed for the museum opening.<eos> H.R., we're speedsters.<eos> We have time.<eos> - Nobody likes a braggart.<eos> - Yeah, but we were actually talking about something important before you showed up,
Wait... no, wait, half-price!<eos> Quarter...<eos> I'll make a new pot of coffee.<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> - No one's coming.<eos> This isn't working. I don't know why.<eos> You see this?<eos> Do you see what you've done, H.R.?<eos> You have distracted us for months, so what?<eos> So that you could feel useful?

Kid Flash!<eos> Kid Flash!<eos> Kid Flash!<eos> Kid Flash!<eos> Kid Flash!<eos> Kid Flash!<eos> Today's top story,<eos> Jared Morillo, aka Plunder, is back in police custody after attempting to rob the Central City Museum.<eos> Morillo was apprehended by a new speedster, who goes by the name Kid Flash.<eos> Well, that settles it. I think you're officially Kid Flash now.
I had to do something while Wally was cuffing him.<eos> Thanks to you, we changed the future.<eos> If we can change one of these events, we can change 'em all.<eos> Nothing is set in stone.<eos> We'll see you guys tonight.<eos> - Can't wait.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I called the local elementary school, and gave the principal discounted tickets.<eos> I figured, hey, you know, if the kids love it, they'll tell their parents, and, well, the rest writes itself.<eos> You, Francisco... are brilliant.
I have an idea.<eos> Eyes up!<eos> Here he comes.<eos> Just the red one.<eos> Nice work.<eos> They're out cold.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> They saved us.<eos> They saved us!<eos> - Who are you?
This is your speed timeline.<eos> This is your maximum velocity when you first acquired your powers.<eos> This is your current top speed, and this is where you need to be in May to cover that distance in 0.21 seconds.<eos> At your current rate of improvement, impossible.<eos> Wow. Thank you for that rousing pep talk, coach.<eos> Okay, why don't you take a knee?<eos> I think we got it covered here.<eos> It looks like it.<eos> I actually have to be back at CCPD.<eos> As do you.
Iris, she tell you about this arms dealer story she's following?<eos> Yeah, she's mentioned it.<eos> Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend, could you look out for her and maybe get her to back off a bit?<eos> Because this isn't something she should be doing on her own.<eos> I agree. I'm trying.<eos> She seem... okay to you, otherwise?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> Do you not think so?<eos> If you guys got something going on,<eos> I hope you know you can talk to me.
- Thank you.<eos> Don't you get tired of running?<eos> That's the thing, running just sort of keeps my mind off of things, I guess.<eos> Must be an amazing feeling.<eos> It is.<eos> You know, cracking a big story gives me an amazing feeling.<eos> And... I think I'm onto one.<eos> That, arms dealer thing?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Because both Dad and Barry want you to lay off of it.
That, arms dealer thing?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Because both Dad and Barry want you to lay off of it.<eos> The phrase "death wish" got tossed around a lot by them.<eos> Okay, I do not have a death wish.<eos> I just want to see justice done like everyone else in this building.<eos> I get that, but it is dangerous, Iris.<eos> Wally, how dangerous could it be?<eos> I don't die till May.<eos> Barry said that in Flashpoint, you and I were a brother-sister crime-fighting team.
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby challenge you for possession of H.R. Wells.<eos> If you want, we can solve this another way.<eos> There's a great spot for drinks...<eos> You realize trial by combat is to the death? Yeah.<eos> For the loser.<eos> Listen, you want him?<eos> You're gonna have to come and claim him.<eos> That's Arwen.<eos> That's... Arwen.<eos> I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare? Do I want the customary...
I don't know.<eos> You did what any of us would have done.<eos> I might not have done it, just being honest.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Lay it out for me.<eos> What are my chances here, scale of one to ten?<eos> She's gonna kill you.<eos> It's a pretty solid "one," mate.<eos> You have the same powers Gypsy does, right?<eos> I mean, she's not doing anything you can't do.
I mean, you don't even like me.<eos> Why would you risk your life for me?<eos> Well, you heard Barry. It's what we do around here.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're not like the other Wellses.<eos> Yeah, so you keep reminding me.<eos> No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.<eos> We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.<eos> You depend on us.
For Francisco?<eos> All right.<eos> This world may be a primitive, uncultured backwater, but they do make an excellent cup of coffee.<eos> That they do.<eos> You know what you gotta try?<eos> You gotta try the Brazilian roast, it's new.<eos> It is so good.<eos> Maybe I'll take a few bags back with me.<eos> Yeah, think that's wise.<eos> Will you be going back in a bag?
- Cheers.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You sure this is the place? - Positive.<eos> - All right.<eos> You ready to bust an arms dealer? - Get me a front-page headline?<eos> - Wally, wait. CCPD's been looking for this guy for months. He might have some sort of secret tunnel network that helps him slip out and get away.<eos> I should do a quick recon. Yeah.<eos> Thorough.<eos> We don't want to miss anything, okay?<eos> Be back in a you-know-what.
God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you.<eos> Don't worry. Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.<eos> He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.<eos> Hell no, I ain't cool with this.<eos> You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation that took the DA's office months to assemble.<eos> You still got the guy, right?<eos> That is not the point, Iris.<eos> The point is, you had you and your brother out there in danger, and for what?<eos> A story?<eos> And where the hell were you?
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.<eos> God.<eos> What?<eos> Iris. What is going on with you?<eos> Joe, I'm sorry...<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Joe already suspects something's up. You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.<eos> This story is going to change lives, Barry.<eos> Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?

In any universe.<eos> This is Earth-2.<eos> You're cute, but you talk too much.<eos> You want to play dirty?<eos> Let's play dirty.<eos> That hurts.<eos> That too.<eos> Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?<eos> Well, this is hot.<eos> I think you're flirting with me to distract me 'cause you're afraid.
Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?<eos> Well, this is hot.<eos> I think you're flirting with me to distract me 'cause you're afraid.<eos> My collection record is flawless.<eos> In these trials, I am undefeated.<eos> Please. Everybody's got a weakness.<eos> Even you.<eos> Says the man afraid of showing everyone how powerful he can be.<eos> You and I resonate on a similar frequency. I can feel it.<eos> Yet you allow your fear and insecurity to hold you back.
It says you're totally fine.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> Go back to your Earth?<eos> Tell all your superiors that you were bested in battle, all the charges against H.R. are dropped. No.<eos> I tell them I killed him.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> If I return empty-handed, they'll know I failed.<eos> And I never fail.<eos> Until today.<eos> Okay, but if you tell them that you killed me, then I...

Until today.<eos> Okay, but if you tell them that you killed me, then I...<eos> You will never go back to Earth-19, ever.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> I guess we have a deal. I don't really have anything to go home for.<eos> You'll always have a home here, H.R.<eos> Listen, I know there's no coffee on your Earth 'cause of the whole Blight thing or whatever, but this... this is just an absurd amount of coffee you're bringing back to your Earth.<eos> That can't be legal.<eos> I mean, I won't tell if you won't.<eos> You know, for someone so fixated on enforcing the law, you sure seem oddly at ease about breaking it.
The first Wells told me my time would come to be a hero, that it was my job to show up, to be ready for when it did.<eos> You know why I love working here?<eos> Why?<eos> We're all making investments in each other.<eos> I made an investment in you, and one day, that investment's gonna pay off when you use that... crazy way of thinking you have to help me out.<eos> I guess if he were here, he would say,<eos> "Show up."<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Be ready. - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause... one day, you might need to save my ass.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar, I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.<eos> But I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> - How are you gonna tell Dad?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> If you guys got something going on, I hope you know you can talk to me.

- Hey, what's up?<eos> - Barry, we got some DNA off Mendez's corpse.<eos> We were about to match it with CCPD records.<eos> The meta's name is Clive Yorkin.<eos> We're sending you his info now.<eos> Detective Joe West!<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You don't remember me?<eos> You and your cronies had a very fun time ruining my life.
A couple weeks now, Joe.<eos> And you're just telling me now?<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Dad, I didn't want them to say anything because I knew how you would react.<eos> This is not something you keep from your father, Iris!<eos> You should've known that.<eos> - And you should've too.<eos> - I know, Joe.<eos> Look, I can understand why they didn't want to tell me because they didn't grow up under the same roof that you did.<eos> They don't know... they don't know what my baby girl means to me, Barry, but you do.
- That's brilliant.<eos> Caitlin, you can freeze her arm.<eos> It'll stop the spread of decay and give us some time to find a cure.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I can't, even if I wanted to.<eos> We're not talking about a cold blast.<eos> This is a specific and continuous cold stream.<eos> Too high a temperature and the decay spreads, too low and the frostbite will destroy your nerve endings.<eos> And that long using my powers, I could lose control.<eos> Caitlin, you are strong, okay? Stronger than you know.
I was really lucky, in a weird way.<eos> You know, I had a lot of people helping me through all of this.<eos> I had Wells... both of 'em... and Jay and Zolomon.<eos> I mean, two of them turned out to be bad guys, but even they were good teachers who really taught me how to use my powers.<eos> I just don't think that I've been that for you yet.<eos> You're telling me everything that I need to learn.<eos> I'm just not getting it.<eos> I... No, that's not it.<eos> It's...<eos> I've been letting you coast by on your raw talent, which you have a lot of, but teaching... it's a lot more than just doing something and expecting you to follow.
But if we find out who they are, then we can be ready for him.<eos> Right, so how do we do that?<eos> We vibe Flashpoint.<eos> Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Stop you right there, BA.<eos> Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.<eos> But in quantum mechanics, the daughter universe theory tell us... - Universe theory. - For every decision you make, a universe exists where you don't.<eos> Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,
This is who I am.<eos> You said it. It's time for me to take responsibility for my actions.<eos> Time for me to own who I really am.<eos> Who you are is Caitlin Snow.<eos> I know firsthand the battle going on inside of you.<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> When it happened to me, I lost.<eos> All right? I was weak, and I let it win.<eos> And I did... I did horrible things to a lot of good people.<eos> And you don't have to do that.

Honesty.<eos> All right. Get some rest, all right?<eos> I'll check on you in a bit.<eos> - Bar?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Savitar's prophecy of someone dying... was it Iris?<eos> But it's not gonna happen.<eos> Look, I'm glad she comes first in your life now.<eos> If you're gonna date my daughter, that's the way it should be.<eos> You're still a close second.
You're already crafting a version of this for your book, aren't you?<eos> "Peace finally descends upon the family West."<eos> The West family, or family West?<eos> Right, it's time I get to work.<eos> At this hour?<eos> Yes, there's still one husk meta out there, and I intend to find him.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Hey, Julian?<eos> - Hi.<eos> I don't think you're weak because of what happened to you with Savitar.
- Good luck at school. - Thank you.<eos> See ya.<eos> - Bye, babe.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Okay, good as new.<eos> Actually, it's better than new with the three extra locks that I added.<eos> Which you didn't have to do.<eos> Well, Cisco did offer to build us a custom security door, but we've both seen how well those things keep people out of S.T.A.R. Labs. - So...<eos> - I like deadbolts. - Deadbolts work.<eos> It's just with... what happened here, I want to make sure you feel safe.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar, I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.<eos> But I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> It's definitely a meta. I think this is someone new.<eos> I'm Cisco, by the way.<eos> You must be Gypsy.
- I'm going to help.<eos> - Your dad would kill me if I let you come along.<eos> I'm a Speedster now, okay?<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> I know, which is exactly why I need you to stay here.<eos> I mean, this city needs protecting while we're gone.<eos> Besides, maybe you can teach Wally a thing or two.<eos> Wait, what is he talking about?<eos> Wow.<eos> So you're... you're a Speedster now
Be safe.<eos> Hey, you see anything hinky, you run.<eos> Listen to me. I don't need to tell you that.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right.<eos> Detective.<eos> Indiana Jones much?<eos> Cisco, my friend, this is not my first expedition, and believe me, this is the perfect attire.<eos> Wait, Julian, what's going on?<eos> I thought you were gonna cover for me.
I'm okay, thanks.<eos> It's important to stay hydrated on a parallel Earth.<eos> So weird being back here on this alternate universe.<eos> This is where I met my doppelganger, the evil one.<eos> - Killer Frost.<eos> - Ah. She's the one I'm always afraid of becoming.<eos> And where is she now?<eos> Dead.<eos> That's not gonna happen to you, Caitlin.<eos> I'm glad you came with us, Julian.
This is between you and me.<eos> Not yet.<eos> - I need him.<eos> - For what?<eos> Why'd you lure him here?<eos> For you.<eos> Need your help.<eos> Help?<eos> Got a funny way of asking for it.<eos> You sent me here!
- I won.<eos> Solovar promised to let us go.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> What do you...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Solovar's words mean nothing now.<eos> You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?<eos> I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.
No?<eos> What do you...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Solovar's words mean nothing now.<eos> You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?<eos> I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.
Father taught me well.<eos> Always think ahead.<eos> And I had plenty of time to think in cages built by you and then by Solovar.<eos> Then why don't you just kill us? Huh? Since we already did your damn dirty work for you.<eos> Still need you.<eos> I'm not doing anything for you.<eos> Not you, Flash.<eos> You.<eos> Me?<eos> You will open the breach to First Earth.
And if... if he does come back, how could I ever tell him I'm leaving?<eos> Well, 'cause you're human.<eos> That's... that's how.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> Look, my point is this.<eos> When it comes to love, you got to go for it.<eos> You know?<eos> Everything else be damned.<eos> 'Cause if you don't, you're gonna end up being the kind of person that lives the rest of their life with regret.<eos> I mean, I know that telling your dad that, you know, you're... you're switching Earths, that's gonna be a difficult conversation to have, but one that you've to go for... if you want to be happy.
I'm sorry you guys missed it. I ain't.<eos> Ohhh.<eos> Word of advice:<eos> don't volunteer for these things.<eos> Nothing ever tries to rip you limb from limb if you don't volunteer.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm so fine, thanks... thanks to our friends, our good friends.<eos> You're welcome, Harry. Wow, I...<eos> I think...<eos> I just forgot how handsome you were.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> And they were smart, but today, at least, we were a bit smarter.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> He's got some cuts and bruises, but Caitlin said he just needs food and a little sleep.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I'm... I'm sorry for being an epic basket case lately.<eos> My, um... my dad was kidnapped once, and it turns your world.<eos> You turn my world, Wally.
How do you do that?<eos> Do what?<eos> Stay positive in the face of overwhelming odds.<eos> Because I plan on living a long life with you, and nothing's gonna take that away from me.<eos> Good.<eos> So does that mean no more nightmares?<eos> You're finally gonna get some sleep tonight?<eos> Well... that last part is entirely up to you.<eos> Like I told Flash, always think ahead.<eos> Now you will open the breaches and very soon,
I'm going back to Earth-2.<eos> Now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow anything I order.<eos> Grodd the gorilla, he's talking through Wells?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who is this gorgeous intruder?<eos> Her name is Gypsy.<eos> She's a Collector.<eos> Open a breach!<eos> Time to warp out of this madhouse.<eos> You will open the breaches, and Central City will fall before Grodd.
Lanterns.<eos> You know what I always say, a fella that can't tell the difference between balls and lanterns is in trouble when the lights go out.<eos> You go front to back.<eos> Toothbrushing. You go front to back?<eos> 'Cause I'm a small circles kind of guy.<eos> I wonder how the other Wells brushes his teeth.<eos> - The murderer?<eos> - I'm fascinated by the subtle differences between us, you know?<eos> - And the not-so-subtle ones.<eos> - Like what? Like the fact that I'm a genius and you're a moron.
In fact, she could be right around the corner.<eos> Gypsy!<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> Where am I?<eos> Why am I locked up?<eos> My powers don't work in here.<eos> Yeah, it's kind of the point of the cell.<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought we were all on the same page.<eos> I spared your life, and you said you'd go back to Earth-19 and tell everyone you killed H.R.
We Wellses, we don't fool easy, do we, hard hat?<eos> Don't call me "hard hat".<eos> We have to find him before he hurts somebody else.<eos> Don't worry, Barry, we will.<eos> Every time I think we've beat him, he comes back stronger, smarter, and more dangerous.<eos> He's evolving.<eos> I keep trying to fight him the same way.<eos> Okay, guys, look, we just have to come up with a different way to beat him.<eos> What we need to do is get ahead of him for once. We can.<eos> You've seen the future.
She's a really powerful meta.<eos> Yeah, but how do we know she's not a Grodd sleeper agent?<eos> She's not.<eos> I checked her out.<eos> Can you convince her to help?<eos> Bro, she won't say no to me.<eos> No way.<eos> You've got three speedsters, an ice queen, and a guy who vibes almost as well as I do.<eos> You don't need my help to stop Grodd.<eos> Need I remind you, you're the one who brought Grodd here in the first place.
Great.<eos> Um, how exactly is this gonna help Cisco vibe any differently?<eos> Simple science.<eos> We just broaden the overall harmonic resonance of Cisco's vibrational frequencies all while focusing them on a fixed temporal locus.<eos> Couldn't be easier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I got to admit, Harry, I was super surprised at how cool you were with Jesse staying on this Earth.<eos> I thought, for sure, you were gonna freak out and throw something or throw someone.<eos> Well, my daughter's happiness is of the utmost importance to me.<eos> And you make her happy.
I showed too much mercy.<eos> No, you did what was right, Barry, as you always do.<eos> That's what makes you a hero.<eos> Oliver has killed.<eos> He's still considered a hero.<eos> Yeah, and he lives with the weight of that decision every single day.<eos> I think that sometimes, the only way to stop bad things from happening is to just get rid of what's causing them.<eos> What is this really about?<eos> Grodd or what happens to me?<eos> I kill Grodd, his attack never happens, that changes the future, and... you live, yeah.
Your humanity, showing mercy, that is what separates you from everyone else.<eos> That's the reason that everyone looks up to you.<eos> Don't compromise who you are... ever.<eos> Losing what makes The Flash The Flash...<eos> My life isn't worth it if that's the cost to save me.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, you know your dad's gonna be all right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Look, I've been thinking, and I...<eos> I don't think you should stay here. I think...
My life isn't worth it if that's the cost to save me.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, you know your dad's gonna be all right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Look, I've been thinking, and I...<eos> I don't think you should stay here. I think...<eos> It was a bad idea.<eos> Um... Wally, you asked me.<eos> Yeah, and I shouldn't have.<eos> I think you should go back to Earth-2... spend as much time with your dad as you can.
Kill him.<eos> That might be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard you say.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Iris is right.<eos> If you don't want to listen, go ahead, keep being an idiot.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Don't.<eos> Kill.<eos> Grodd.<eos> Harry, you of all people should understand.
Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> The Philosopher's Stone has been the key to everything.<eos> So we destroy the Stone, and Savitar is gone for good.<eos> There's only one thing we can do with it.<eos> Throw it into the Speed Force.<eos> I have to do what I can to help.<eos> I'm the guy who avoided his dying mother for weeks.<eos> I have a whole lot to make up for.<eos> I like you, Julian, but I'm also afraid of my powers and what they could do to anyone who gets close to me.<eos> I didn't ask for these powers, just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.
When Barry and I first met...<eos> You mean him.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I...<eos> Really. I mean, as long as I can get that plus-one.<eos> 'Cause, you know, me and Gypsy, we about to tear up the dance floor for you guys.<eos> Barry.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Now, I wanted to be sure that you heard what I said in there.
Now, I wanted to be sure that you heard what I said in there.<eos> I couldn't be happier.<eos> Okay, right.<eos> So... why didn't you ask my permission?<eos> I mean, I told you the story of me asking Francine's dad's permission, like, a hundred times.<eos> At least, yeah.<eos> And that's a great story.<eos> But you missed the point?<eos> I... yeah, I... I don't... it was spontaneous.<eos> I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.
Come to talk me into it, then?<eos> No.<eos> Barry's lost his bloody mind if he thinks I'm gonna volunteer to be... abused again.<eos> He's just trying to protect Iris.<eos> We all are.<eos> But... not like that.<eos> Is the reason you don't want to do this because... you don't want me to see it?<eos> I just think... hearing his voice coming out of me, I... it just makes it impossible for you to see me as a normal...<eos> Hey.<eos> I've had somebody else's voice coming out of my mouth, and you were still able to see the real me.
- Thank you.<eos> Let's just get this over with, yeah?<eos> Bow before my greatness.<eos> Be in awe, as you are in the presence of the Almighty.<eos> Enough with the... religious nonsense.<eos> You were just a man.<eos> Like me.<eos> I'm nothing like you, Barry.<eos> You're cruel, you're selfish.<eos> From my perspective, you're the big bad.
Like me.<eos> I'm nothing like you, Barry.<eos> You're cruel, you're selfish.<eos> From my perspective, you're the big bad.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Still here, pretender?<eos> Still trying to find your place?<eos> I found my place.<eos> It's standing here with these people, against you.<eos> You know, the sad thing is that you live.
You thought that Thawne and Zoom were your biggest foes, but... but it's me.<eos> It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!<eos> I never asked for any of this, Joe.<eos> I am only this way because of you.<eos> All of you!<eos> When do we meet?<eos> Not long now.<eos> You're there when I become who I am.
When do we meet?<eos> Not long now.<eos> You're there when I become who I am.<eos> You're saying I caused you to get your speed?<eos> - I created you?<eos> - No.<eos> I created myself, Barry.<eos> Only I can bring out my greatness.<eos> Your greatness?<eos> Well, you're still trapped, wherever you are, and I don't know how you're gonna escape.
Well, you're still trapped, wherever you are, and I don't know how you're gonna escape.<eos> I mean, we got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> Did we?<eos> I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.<eos> Every step, every move that you make, it only brings me nearer to it.<eos> I only need one more thing.<eos> Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.<eos> Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?<eos> But I know you are.<eos> I'm sorry that you have to die.
I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.<eos> Every step, every move that you make, it only brings me nearer to it.<eos> I only need one more thing.<eos> Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.<eos> Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?<eos> But I know you are.<eos> I'm sorry that you have to die.<eos> But it's you or me.<eos> And despite your feeble efforts to change the future, you can't, because I am the future, Flash.<eos> Barry, you've had to suffer worse than anyone.
His car's GPS has him located somewhere near...<eos> Mount Buccelato.<eos> Buccelato, that's miles away.<eos> What... what would he be doing over there?<eos> There's one way to find out.<eos> Talk to us.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Some serious "Temple of Doom" stuff.<eos> They have a box.<eos> God of Speed, soon your enemies will fall and you will rise once more on Earth.
Nobody can do anything effectively coming from a place of fear.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> Savitar can get inside my head.<eos> What am I supposed to do if he does that at the wrong time?<eos> It sure would be a lot easier if I just knew exactly how that night went.<eos> Would it ever.<eos> Are you picking up what I'm putting down?<eos> Let's go.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not gonna vibe you there for you to watch your sister die.
Was it good? Did that... did that help?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It helped a lot.<eos> Wally...<eos> Why does nobody ever listen to me?<eos> You're so full of it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Railing at me for not telling everyone about Savitar?<eos> What about what you're not telling everyone, Barry?
- It's the last time, all right?<eos> And only long enough to see if maybe we can track his location.<eos> - Is that possible?<eos> - No. No.<eos> Julian, we gotta end this, for everybody's sake.<eos> I'll see you downstairs.<eos> Okay, well, you guys can count me out, all right? 'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply of boxers to this planet.<eos> Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.
Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.<eos> Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But you're not concerned, are you?<eos> You just want your own personal meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.<eos> Julian, I don't want these powers.<eos> I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if or when I'm gonna lose this battle and become Killer Frost.<eos> I thought you more than anyone would understand that.
Dad.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> Thought you might need a pick-me-up.<eos> Worked like a charm when you were a kid.<eos> Smaller problems.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> - you wanna talk about it?<eos> - I don't know what I want, Dad.<eos> Iris... whatever you may be feeling right now about Barry, that man does love you.
Smaller problems.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> - you wanna talk about it?<eos> - I don't know what I want, Dad.<eos> Iris... whatever you may be feeling right now about Barry, that man does love you.<eos> That... that kind of love is rare.<eos> Dad, I wish it were that simple.<eos> Simple.<eos> Look, only you know... what's good for you.
You're right.<eos> I... I'll make it up to them.<eos> It's just, this whole thing is messing with my head.<eos> - Don't let it. - You don't get it, Jesse.<eos> When you got your powers, you were walking down the street.<eos> Me?<eos> I just feel, because of all of that, I... there's something wrong with me.<eos> I feel like Savitar has some kind of... hold on me.<eos> Look, I know.<eos> Okay? But you're strong, Wally.
You're not alone.<eos> Mom.<eos> You're never alone, Wally.<eos> - I've missed you so much.<eos> - I missed you too.<eos> Wally?<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Of what you're trying to become.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> I just want you to be proud of me.
- I have to.<eos> - Wally.<eos> You're in my head again.<eos> You were always so smart. Weren't you, Wallace?<eos> But not smart enough.<eos> I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.<eos> No, not everything.<eos> We still have a piece of that Stone.<eos> Not for long.<eos> And once I have it, you and everyone you love will perish.
I just want you to listen. Okay?<eos> I need you to... let me say what I need to say.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not angry... at you.<eos> I understand that you... you want to keep me safe, and us getting engaged could change the future. I...<eos> I get all of that.<eos> Barry, when you proposed to me... I said yes because... I love you more than anything.<eos> And I want to be your wife.<eos> But I thought that you were asking me purely out of love, not fear.<eos> And, Barry, whether you realize it or not, now there's always gonna be a part of us that's tainted.
Can't even open a portal.<eos> You can't get rid of that Stone, Wallace.<eos> Like you can't get rid of me.<eos> Shut up, shut up.<eos> You know it's true.<eos> You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force by yourself.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm going to get out of here, Wallace.<eos> And then I'm gonna come for you... and Barry and your sister, and I'll kill everyone you love.<eos> No, you're not real!
Where's Wally?<eos> What just happened to him?<eos> Like the Greek myth of Atlas, who could not put down the sky until someone took his place,<eos> Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.<eos> You know me.<eos> I love a good myth.<eos> He took your place. What...<eos> When you created Flashpoint, you unwittingly provided me with the means for my return.<eos> Wally...<eos> You gave me the idea to turn Wally into Kid Flash, to make him fast enough to replace me in your prison.
Suffering in an endless void for all eternity.<eos> Another victim Barry Allen failed to save.<eos> No!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> If you had the strength to end my life, you would have done it in the future.<eos> But Barry Allen doesn't kill.<eos> He's the good guy.<eos> The boy Joe raised.<eos> The man Iris loves.<eos> You have everything.
- That's exactly what I can do.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Now we're cooking with helium.<eos> Yes, and I can... I can add a biological component that will measure his vitals when he's in the Speed Force.<eos> - That's a great idea.<eos> - Thank you, Caitlin.<eos> Because if we can monitor Barry's vitals, we'll know if they fluctuate, and we can pull him out.<eos> You mean "pull us out."<eos> Yeah, if you're going in there to save Wally, so am I.<eos> Jesse, you're gonna stay here.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Iris... did I lose you?<eos> Bar.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> I'm just trying to make her... not worry so much.<eos> About Wally or you?<eos> Joe, now's not the time, all right?<eos> Look, you... are about to risk your life to save her brother.
I'm gonna go after him.<eos> Jesse, are you out of your mind?<eos> No, okay?<eos> I can't just sit here waiting.<eos> You can, and you will.<eos> We all will. And, soon enough, Barry's gonna get Wally out of the Speed Force.<eos> You don't know that, okay?<eos> We don't know anything.<eos> The only thing we actually know is that Savitar is out there, and, if we can, we have to find him and send him right back where he came from.<eos> You're staying here.
Merlot or Cabernet?<eos> What?<eos> What wine do you think would go best with a big, old men's size 11 shoe stuffed in his mouth?<eos> - H.R.?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Just leave me alone.<eos> - I get it, I get it.<eos> I get...<eos> Savitar...<eos> Savitar hurt the one you love, now you wanna hurt Savitar.
- Just leave me alone.<eos> - I get it, I get it.<eos> I get...<eos> Savitar...<eos> Savitar hurt the one you love, now you wanna hurt Savitar.<eos> Yeah, bet your ass, I do.<eos> No, I get it. I...<eos> I love it.<eos> I respect it.<eos> I'm a little worried though that, in your zeal for payback, you might be the one who ends up getting hurt.
Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Like Savitar, though?<eos> 'Cause, look, here's the thing.<eos> If your father were here, he would...<eos> He would do everything in his power to stop Savitar.<eos> And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I mean, hats off to you.<eos> You really are Hard-Hat Harry's little girl, aren't you?<eos> Yeah, I am, and you're not him.
What's happening to him?<eos> Wally West is caught in an endless temporal loop, just like Savitar after you imprisoned him here in the future.<eos> No wonder he hates you.<eos> What's he seeing?<eos> He's reliving the single most painful moment of his life... over and over again.<eos> His mother's death.<eos> Wally.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You do?
Because I know everything that happens.<eos> I've already lived it.<eos> - I'm not afraid of you.<eos> - You should be.<eos> Jesse.<eos> H.R.?<eos> It's a little late to talk me out of this, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna try and talk you out of anything.<eos> I learned that lesson.<eos> You have something that belongs to me.
Just ask Wallace.<eos> Yeah, yeah, what... what Wally saw... it's gonna haunt him for a while.<eos> So until he can get past it, and he's really ready to go back out there, Kid Flash is... gonna need to take a break for a while.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Are you?<eos> Right.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> Caitlin said I'll be fine.<eos> Jesse, I can't believe you went after Savitar by yourself.

Could be, or it could be...<eos> Supergirl?<eos> Kara...<eos> - What happened to her?<eos> - We don't know, but whoever did it has come to this world.<eos> Her vitals are low.<eos> How long has she been like this?<eos> A few hours.<eos> Okay, we need to find whoever did this to Kara and punch him repeatedly until he reverses whatever spell he put on her, and I get to punch him first.<eos> Who are you exactly?
Not much.<eos> It's like he just materialized out of thin air.<eos> You mean like this clown just did?<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Wallace...<eos> I understand what you've been through.<eos> Stuck in the Speed Force, things you saw...<eos> I get it.<eos> I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.<eos> When you get bucked from the horse, best thing you can do... get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.
Whoa-ho-ho! Wally West made it here too.<eos> This is exciting.<eos> It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.<eos> What do you want with Supergirl?<eos> Same thing that I want with both of you.<eos> To teach you all a lesson.<eos> Is that all you got, Kid Flash?<eos> I mean, you look a little scared.<eos> And you're too slow.
Nighty-night, Flash.<eos> - ♪ Moon... ♪<eos> - What the hell?<eos> ♪ River ♪<eos> ♪ Wider than a mile ♪<eos> ♪ I'm crossing... ♪ Kara?<eos> ♪ You in style someday ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, dream maker ♪<eos> ♪ You heart breaker ♪<eos> ♪ Wherever you're going ♪
- Who?<eos> - Who?<eos> Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> Former head of the League of Assassins.<eos> The what of the what?<eos> What the hell you talking about, kid?<eos> My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club, and both of you work for me.<eos> We what now?<eos> I pay you to sing, not pepper me with questions.<eos> And I hope you got something better in your songbook than what you were belting out up there, blondie.

Yeah, I had a cousin like that.<eos> I had to slit his throat too.<eos> Oh.<eos> Grady! Get these two set up.<eos> And nothing I've heard before.<eos> I want something original.<eos> Barry, I don't have my powers.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Winn!<eos> Winn, you're here too? Ah!
Who's Winn?<eos> The name is Grady.<eos> I tickle the keys around here.<eos> Say, you realize how he got the nickname "Cutter," don't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Because he likes to cut people.<eos> You ask me, I think he's all talk.<eos> Cisco... not Cisco.<eos> Hello.<eos> I pray that, one day, you do not find out how very, very wrong you are, Pablo.
- Now go do your job.<eos> - All right.<eos> You see, Grady doesn't know this, but one day, I'm gonna be somebody.<eos> I'm gonna be somebody, and it's gonna happen right there on that stage.<eos> You'll see. I just need my one shot.<eos> It's just curiouser and curiouser.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's like "The Wizard of Oz."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - "And you were there,<eos> - "and you were there...."
Okay, so remember, she might look like Iris, but she is not Iris.<eos> I know. This is gonna be weird.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> I'm glad we haven't seen someone that looks like Mon-El.<eos> I'd probably just punch him in the face for the fun of it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That's her.<eos> Sounds like she's in trouble.<eos> Here, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door in.<eos> You stand back, I'll kick the door in.
Call me the Martian Manhunter.<eos> I think you'll find that J'onn's a lot more than... just a pretty face.<eos> Guys!<eos> Hello.<eos> Also, Barry and Kara's vitals are all over the place.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right.<eos> Hello, friends!<eos> Kid Flash.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you could join the party.
Who is the, uh... the lucky boy?<eos> Tommy Moran.<eos> You... you mean Cutter Moran's kid?<eos> Dad, look, we're in love.<eos> - The hell you are.<eos> - He's a hooligan!<eos> His father's a hooligan.<eos> - His mother is...<eos> - Hey! Not in front of the girl.<eos> And you're not loving that boy.
I was hoping would visit me the most.<eos> Fix them.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't.<eos> If you ever want to get out of that cell, that's exactly what you're gonna do.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> You don't understand, big guy.<eos> That's just not how it works. My powers don't work that way.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're the one who did this to them.

Previously on "The Flash."<eos> I'm free!<eos> - Who are you? - I am the future Flash.<eos> I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.<eos> I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.<eos> You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.<eos> - That's not the only reason.<eos> - I wish I could believe that.<eos> I'm Cisco, by the way.<eos> You must be Gypsy.
Aw, thank you.<eos> Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, he did.<eos> Okay, so, break it down.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,<eos> Barry sang to me.<eos> - And then he proposed.<eos> Oh, my God, that's so romantic.<eos> - You sing?
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.<eos> Therein lies the rub.<eos> I feel like we can't understand any of this until it actually happens.<eos> It's like Savitar's prophecies.<eos> Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.<eos> - Well, all bar one.<eos> It's a crime scene.<eos> We gotta go. - Stagg Industries?<eos> - All right, no.<eos> Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if I can pry those lips open, all right?<eos> Okay. I'll keep working on it.<eos> This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.<eos> I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.<eos> Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.<eos> I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.<eos> That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.
No!<eos> He calls himself Abra Kadabra.<eos> As in hocus pocus?<eos> He's certainly got a lot of tricks.<eos> Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.<eos> Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.<eos> So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?<eos> Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.<eos> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is... "... indistinguishable from magic."<eos> Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?<eos> How many bad guys have we taken down?<eos> I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?<eos> Life doesn't keep score, Barry.<eos> You should know that better than anyone.<eos> Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.<eos> But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.<eos> - Barry...<eos> - Iris, he can save your life.<eos> No, you can save my life.
You should know that better than anyone.<eos> Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.<eos> But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.<eos> - Barry...<eos> - Iris, he can save your life.<eos> No, you can save my life.<eos> Not him.<eos> Trust me, I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.<eos> But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain walk free just to save my life.<eos> And you know, deep down, I don't think you want that either.
I knew you'd come.<eos> 'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To be set free.<eos> Murdering people, stealing smart tech.<eos> You came here for something.<eos> Told you before, Detective, it is beyond your understanding.<eos> This is about my daughter's life.<eos> It's as simple as that for me.<eos> You tell me who Savitar is, and I will let you go.
Damn it!<eos> - Kadabra's on the loose!<eos> - He's somewhere in the building!<eos> And there we are.<eos> Thank you, Doctor Wells.<eos> Joe, he's headed for the elevator!<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Your freedom for Savitar's identity.<eos> I've altered the terms of our agreement.<eos> It appears that you have as well.
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.<eos> Then what are we going to do? None of us are doctors and she can't operate on herself.<eos> We do have another option.<eos> What is it?<eos> When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate offsets cold tissue destruction.<eos> She can regenerate?<eos> No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.<eos> I don't need a hospital.<eos> All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.<eos> You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.<eos> He opened up a wormhole.<eos> What do you say?<eos> We can't let him get past us.<eos> We're not gonna do that.<eos> Catch me if you can.<eos> Where's he at?<eos> He's on State and Main!<eos> We're on it!<eos> You shall not pass!
Thank you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I should've been stronger.<eos> You think you should've shot Kadabra?<eos> Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.<eos> I try to be strong for you guys, for you and Wally and Barry.<eos> Dad, you have been, and it makes me stronger too.<eos> When you were a baby, I was...<eos> I was terrified that you might die in the middle of the night.

I'm serious.<eos> Promise me... that you're gonna make sure that my dad is okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> We, uh... we should go.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, probably should've made that out of carbyne.<eos> Rookie mistake.<eos> You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.
Just keep everybody else away from the pipeline.<eos> Barry, last time you went to the future, it was by accident.<eos> How are you supposed to get there now?<eos> With your help.<eos> You sure this is gonna work?<eos> I calculated the force from the explosion that propelled me to the future last time.<eos> At your fastest speed, you can create three times that force.<eos> It's more than enough to get me where I want to go.<eos> All right.<eos> Just run as fast as you can.
2017...<eos> Savitar.<eos> I need to talk to me.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> So H.R. stopped the S.T.A.R. Labs museum?<eos> H.R. went on to other things.<eos> What about Caitlin?<eos> Once she became Killer Frost, she never stepped in this building again.<eos> So I shut down this place?<eos> My friend, you shut everything down.
My friend, you shut everything down.<eos> S.T.A.R. Labs, Team Flash... you didn't want us around.<eos> - So you pushed us away.<eos> - Why? You said it was because of what we represented.<eos> That we were a constant reminder to you of what you lost.<eos> But you weren't the only one who lost something.<eos> Are you sure he's here?<eos> He never leaves this place.<eos> Well, what are you doing?<eos> Aren't you gonna come with me?
It's been a while, gentlemen.<eos> Especially you, Flash.<eos> More than you know.<eos> Allen?<eos> Yeah, it's me, Julian.<eos> From the past.<eos> 2017.<eos> 2017.<eos> The year it all began.<eos> I'll assume you're here for some answers then, are you?
But I won't when I go back. I'm gonna find you.<eos> And I'm gonna help you.<eos> You're no match for the God of Speed.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> Well, secrets always were our thing, weren't they?<eos> When I became Killer Frost,<eos> Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.<eos> We made one hell of a team.<eos> Why would you help him?<eos> Because he gave me the thing that you couldn't: the cure to my illness, embracing who I really am.
And I'm gonna help you.<eos> You're no match for the God of Speed.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> Well, secrets always were our thing, weren't they?<eos> When I became Killer Frost,<eos> Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.<eos> We made one hell of a team.<eos> Why would you help him?<eos> Because he gave me the thing that you couldn't: the cure to my illness, embracing who I really am.<eos> You know who he is.
I just wanted to see you.<eos> Just wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> Now you want to know?<eos> After all this time, now?<eos> Uh, Joe, um...<eos> I'm doing my best.<eos> What happened to us?<eos> My daughter's life was taken.<eos> My son's.<eos> And then you left me, Barry.
I'm doing my best.<eos> What happened to us?<eos> My daughter's life was taken.<eos> My son's.<eos> And then you left me, Barry.<eos> The last piece of who I was... left.<eos> Turned his back and ran away.<eos> I wasn't there for you?<eos> Why start now?<eos> I'm gonna need you to leave, Barry.
He's... he's... he's not gonna help me, man. He's broken.<eos> And if Caitlin's working with Savitar, I need to get back. I need... before she's lost to us forever.<eos> What about everyone else?<eos> - Don't you want to help them?<eos> I should've known.<eos> No matter what I do, you're gonna abandon the ones close to you.<eos> Cisco, it's not like that.<eos> I just...<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> But you want me to.
Yeah.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You know the resonance field you create when you run?<eos> This disrupts that.<eos> I might not be able to use my powers, but I still know something about tech.<eos> Why would you keep me here?<eos> 'Cause I miss my friend.<eos> Cis...<eos> If you want to go, I'm not gonna stop you.<eos> I don't know why I expected you to be the same Barry Allen I remember.
Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.<eos> I'm gonna do something to fix that.<eos> You're too good of a superhero to lose those powers.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know you're my BFF, right?<eos> You too, man.<eos> Wait, did you... Did it not work?
Right, team?<eos> Team Flash.<eos> On three.<eos> Okay.<eos> Joe.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I just... I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I'm always gonna be there for you.
Anyway, so I've been doing some calculations. Mm-hmm?<eos> I think there might be a way to manipulate it.<eos> Mm-hmm? Maybe even... control it.<eos> Maybe even turn it into a prison.<eos> Maybe. Um, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean... just a random thought.<eos> How do you think one would accomplish that?<eos> - See, I don't know... - Okay. because the university wouldn't fund my research.<eos> Why are you so interested in this?
Mm-hmm? Maybe even... control it.<eos> Maybe even turn it into a prison.<eos> Maybe. Um, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean... just a random thought.<eos> How do you think one would accomplish that?<eos> - See, I don't know... - Okay. because the university wouldn't fund my research.<eos> Why are you so interested in this?<eos> Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.<eos> I certainly don't think you're a crackpot.
What did I ever do to you?<eos> So what?<eos> You're Savitar's lackey now?<eos> More fun to reign in hell and all that.<eos> All right, I'm gonna get her to head back this way.<eos> When she does, you gotta knock her out, okay?<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now, Cisco!<eos> Savitar says I'm not allowed to kill you, but I can't have you following me around.
Cait!<eos> Cait!<eos> This is where the Flashy Flash goes down?<eos> It's not exactly what I imagined, but it's cool.<eos> So I always wondered how you kept the friction from building up a lethal dose of static charge.<eos> Yeah, that's vulcanized Teflon.<eos> It neutralizes any electron imbalance.<eos> Okay, and the... the White Witch?<eos> I'm guessing you know why she's after me.<eos> Well, she's teamed up with an evil speedster from the future, and apparently you developed the technology to trap him for an eternity, so...
Speed Force, being able to control it, manipulate it, all of that...<eos> I'm right?<eos> It appears so.<eos> That's me?<eos> Nobel Prize?<eos> All of that?<eos> In the future, yeah.<eos> Look, Tracy.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We need you to build this trap now.
Yeah, there's one thing I need to know first.<eos> Outside Jitters earlier, you could've stopped Caitlin with a vibe.<eos> But just like CCU, you didn't.<eos> I'm not doing this again. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You are.<eos> I need to know, Cisco.<eos> Tell me why you couldn't do it.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> Caitlin could be home now.<eos> Had you stopped her, she would be here.
I'm walking around with two loaded guns here, ready to go off.<eos> What if she's hurting Barry or Joe or you... and I have to save you and I can't control my powers and I end up killing her?<eos> She's my best friend.<eos> And I'd rather it be me than her.<eos> How's Tracy holding up?<eos> Ah, we'll see.<eos> Have you told Cecile about us yet?<eos> Cecile is the only thing... normal I have in my life right now, and I like having something normal.<eos> If I tell her about all this... that goes away.<eos> But if you don't tell her...
And I used to find that comforting. - But then when your team showed me the future... and showed me that my crazy ideas aren't so crazy after all,<eos> I just felt more intimidated than ever.<eos> Well, I can see that.<eos> It's like you're sitting in the shadow of greatness.<eos> - Your own greatness, right?<eos> - Exactly!<eos> It's like I've failed so many times.<eos> That's all I know how to do.<eos> I don't know how to be that... brilliant woman in the hologram.<eos> But you wouldn't understand.

Um, I'm not... technically a genius.<eos> That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry I misled you about me being a genius.<eos> The point is, you... are... a genius.
That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry I misled you about me being a genius.<eos> The point is, you... are... a genius.<eos> You are. I know it.<eos> I can... I can feel it.<eos> It's right there.<eos> It's right there, just brimming just below the surface.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes, absolutely!<eos> Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.
- It is?<eos> - Yes, absolutely!<eos> Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.<eos> All you need is to just believe in yourself.<eos> And for what it's worth... I already do.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were dropping by.<eos> Yeah, well, if you had read any of my texts, you'd know. Yeah.
Is it because I said, "I love you," this morning?<eos> Because, Joe, it's... it's okay if you're not ready to say it back.<eos> No, no. It's not about that.<eos> No?<eos> Well, then what's going on?<eos> 'Cause you've been acting weird all day.<eos> I mean, not just with us this morning but at work with that meta case.<eos> You gotta give me something, Joe.<eos> All I can say is... that part of my life is very complicated.<eos> And if you were to become part of that, your life would be very complicated, and it would change us.
Here I was, thinking that being together was the best thing for both of us.<eos> I guess I'll, uh... I'll see you around the station, Joe.<eos> - Cecile!<eos> - Joe!<eos> - No!<eos> - Joe!<eos> Guarantee you I'm faster.<eos> Caitlin... we can talk about this.<eos> I'll talk.<eos> You listen.
It's over, Caitlin.<eos> Caitlin is dead.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Go. Go. Go.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had to stop you to save you.<eos> My ascension is nearly at hand, Flash.<eos> As I rise, you will fall.
- Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was it?<eos> It was... yeah, it was great.<eos> Jesse says hi.<eos> - So you talked to Cecile?<eos> - I did.<eos> Told her everything.<eos> Told her I love her.<eos> I told her that you were The Flash and that Wally was Kid Flash.
All of you.<eos> I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.<eos> Without it, nothing really matters.<eos> And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?<eos> - How was Earth-3?<eos> - Yeah, um, hanging out with Jesse was awesome.<eos> I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.<eos> Without it, nothing really matters.<eos> And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?<eos> You did this to me, Barry.
Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be... I'll be right back, all right?<eos> I'm here!<eos> I'm here!<eos> I know who you are.<eos> It's about time.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Everything with you is about time, isn't it?<eos> The past, the present, the future... you know all of it, right?<eos> And you know everything about me!
It's like looking in a mirror.<eos> Well... not quite.<eos> You're not so scary without your armor.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I outgrew red.<eos> I know what you are.<eos> You're a time remnant.<eos> A temporal duplicate... created when you run back in time and meet yourself.<eos> You brought a remnant to life last year to defeat Zoom.<eos> Your duplicate died, saving the multiverse, and you continued your happy little life.
Part of him is.<eos> He said it was like looking in a mirror, and he was right.<eos> But not just the way that he looked.<eos> It was... it was his eyes.<eos> The pain that was inside them.<eos> I've seen that in myself.<eos> When I think about... how my parents died so violently... sometimes I want to repay that violence with more violence.<eos> I want to make someone else... hurt as much as I do.<eos> But you don't ever do that.<eos> You're not him.

He is.
No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here to do some weird brain surgery on me?<eos> Or maybe you're like those criminals who trick people into hotel rooms so they can steal their kidneys.<eos> Do I still have my kidneys?<eos> We don't want your kidneys.<eos> Okay, Barry... look at these photographs.<eos> We're your friends. Your family.<eos> We just want to help you, okay?<eos> That's a nice ring.<eos> Who's the lucky guy?<eos> You are, Barry.
What do you mean he has amnesia?<eos> Bar, what's her name?<eos> Felicia?<eos> My God.<eos> Is this... is this like a... like a Flash thing?<eos> Was he battling a super villain who used his evil powers to steal Barry's memory?<eos> Um... no, we sort of accidentally did this to him ourselves.<eos> Why?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> What does matter... is you stalling that judge.
Bart.<eos> I got some friends down at the courthouse.<eos> I'm gonna go down there and see if we can delay this whole Coolidge situation, all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It just seems like everybody's upset and it feels like it's my fault.<eos> No.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Look, we just want you to get back to normal.
Look, we just want you to get back to normal.<eos> That's it, okay?<eos> Well, I would, if I could remember what normal is.<eos> I mean, what have you and I been doing lately?<eos> Are we planning the wedding?<eos> Like, are we sending out wedding invitations or picked a honeymoon destination, or...<eos> Am I a warm weather guy or a cold weather guy?<eos> Actually, we've been a little busy lately, so...<eos> With what?<eos> Um, nothing that you need to worry about, okay?
Kneeling.<eos> Brooding time is over.<eos> You revealed yourself.<eos> Now what?<eos> Any idea what to do with Flash and Friends?<eos> Because we are getting pretty close to your big becoming, and if we don't take them down, neither one of us gets what we want.<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Who are you?
- Science club.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Key Club...<eos> - Astronomy Club...<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Yearbook?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And anime club?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You loved...
My presence usually dampens the mood. - Joe, don't.<eos> - You fire, I'll fire.<eos> What the hell is she doing here?<eos> - She wants to help.<eos> - Help?<eos> - With what?<eos> - With the fact that I lost my powers.<eos> Barry, why don't you give us a minute?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> Are you like a super villain?
The synchrotron, that's what it was.<eos> So anyway, we were struggling, and we were burning the midnight oil, and we could not get the dubnium capacitor to hold a single charge.<eos> And so all of a sudden...<eos> Ronnie just loses all his chill. He turns beet red, and he starts yelling at the thing like,<eos> "Come on, you dumb-nium capacitor!"<eos> "Take charge."<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> My God.<eos> I think about all the memories I cherish most, and... and you're in every single one of them, Caitlin.
You're The Flash.<eos> You sure The Streak isn't a better name, maybe?<eos> Turn on the TV.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Eyewitnesses say the man who set the fire to the offices is none other than Lucious Coolidge, AKA Heat Monger.<eos> That's the guy that went free because of me.<eos> At this rate, it won't be long before the whole thing burns down.<eos> There's hundreds of people who work in there.<eos> We need to stop it.<eos> I mean, you can't right now.
Barry?<eos> I need you to remember.<eos> - I can't!<eos> - Yes, yes, you can. Okay?<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> The night that your mom died,<eos> I didn't want to tell you how, but she didn't die peacefully.<eos> - She was murdered.<eos> - What?<eos> And you came to live with us.
No. No, we're not.<eos> Hello, Flash.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Barry Allen. The hero of Central City.<eos> This is Siberia in the year 1892. We're a little out of your jurisdiction.<eos> Yeah, hear me out. I wanna recruit you... for a mission.<eos> I'm already helping a bunch of idiot do-gooders.<eos> Sorry. I'm up to my fuzzy hood in teamwork.<eos> Would it help if I said please? No.<eos> And you already have a bunch of superhero types in your life.

Fine. You say we need Snart's help, we need his help.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Flash... damaged my suit in our fight.<eos> Pretty badass.<eos> Very godlike.<eos> Well, dress for the job you want.<eos> We're a team, right?<eos> Barry and Caitlin, at it again.<eos> You're not Caitlin.
If she doesn't die, I'm never born.<eos> Right, but... behind that pretty little face of yours, you still remember everything that Barry does.<eos> So you remember growing up with Iris, falling in love with her, kissing her. You sure you're ready to end her life?<eos> What I remember... is being created as a disposable life.<eos> Something to be... thrown away when Barry Allen was done with me.<eos> He didn't care about me.<eos> Why should I care about his love?<eos> You're not having second thoughts, are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Because you know what you need to do, and when the time comes, I expect you to be ready.
- Dad.<eos> - Oh, that reminds me.<eos> - What, um... what was that song you used to sing all the time?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> - "What Does It Take." - "What Does It Take"!<eos> ♪ I tried, I tried ♪<eos> ♪ I tried, I tried ♪ ♪ In every way I could ♪<eos> ♪ To make you see how much I love you ♪<eos> ♪ I hope you understood ♪
Uh! Raspberry and coriander.<eos> Mmm! Yes, it is... it's a home...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - ... is what it is. You know what?<eos> It's my home.<eos> It's my... It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say... I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.
- What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did? - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Yeah. And with you here,<eos> I understand... my purpose.<eos> It's us.<eos> You and me.<eos> That meeting of the mind that we have, it's just so powerful... But H.R., you're from another Earth...
That meeting of the mind that we have, it's just so powerful... But H.R., you're from another Earth...<eos> - Yeah, I... yeah...<eos> I'm a unemployed, former grad student, who...<eos> Come work at S.T.A.R. Labs with me.<eos> Okay?<eos> I mean, it doesn't pay much.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Ah, it pays next to nothing. But you know what? It wouldn't matter.<eos> We'd be together.<eos> Imagine: me inspiring you, and you applying that inspiration, and us changing the world together.
By all means, you first.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Reminds me of "Jaws."<eos> They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.<eos> How long do you think he'll stay asleep?<eos> I like "Shark Week." I'm not a marine biologist.<eos> Snart!<eos> Barry!<eos> This place is gonna be crawling with ARGUS agents in the next two minutes.<eos> Look on the bright side, Barry. This is your chance to show how ruthless you really are.
Look on the bright side, Barry. This is your chance to show how ruthless you really are.<eos> Sometimes you gotta make a tough call, Barry.<eos> Cisco?<eos> We need your help.<eos> I have the energy source, but... Snart's trapped inside the cell with King Shark.<eos> You gotta open the door.<eos> I can't hack into the mainframe.<eos> Hurry, all right?<eos> Cisco's working on it.<eos> Whatever you do, don't look behind you.
Do it.<eos> And get this guy back to wherever he belongs.<eos> Took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> Tell me, Snart, did you think I had it in me?<eos> To leave you behind?<eos> I wasn't sure.<eos> Always known you had the potential to be as ruthless as they come.<eos> Your history made sure of that, same as mine.<eos> Who knows, maybe that's why we get along.<eos> You see the good in me.
- I'm sorry, Barry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - It's okay. No, it's not.<eos> It's not okay, Barry. I should have been there for her,<eos> - I should have protected her...<eos> - Look, you did everything you could, All right?<eos> You trusted me, and I let you down.<eos> - Listen to me. Listen to me!<eos> - I let you down. There's no way you could ever let me down.<eos> You've become the hero I always knew you could be.
Of course, you should feel nervous.<eos> You would be insane not to.<eos> 'They picked you out of thousands of actresses' 'to play the lead role of August' because you are perfect for the role.<eos> 'You've got this.'<eos> You know that Jake still didn't come home last night.<eos> Yeah, he texted me.<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's in the desert working on his script.<eos> He just needs some space.<eos> Ooh, I hope you're right.
I-it's exactly like in the book.<eos> Paige!<eos> Arthur, first AD.<eos> - Hi, Arthur.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> My kid did not give a crap when I did "Spiderman" but she will not stop talkin' about August.<eos> You're her favorite character of all-time.<eos> Well, August is her favorite character.<eos> No, you're August now.
I have my own chair?<eos> [gasps] Ah, there she is.<eos> Hi, Wyatt.<eos> Day one on a $200 million movie.<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> $200 million?<eos> Largest tent-pole Gold Brothers has ever done.<eos> Two hundred and eighty one people on the crew and you are the star of this thing, Paige.
Thanks.<eos> I have to get to wardrobe actually, so...<eos> Wait.<eos> Just...<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you.<eos> I'm sorry... okay?<eos> You were right.<eos> You deserve more.<eos> But I-I was... hopin' that we can move past that and be friends again.<eos> Like how you and Jordan are friends again?
Wait.<eos> Just...<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you.<eos> I'm sorry... okay?<eos> You were right.<eos> You deserve more.<eos> But I-I was... hopin' that we can move past that and be friends again.<eos> Like how you and Jordan are friends again?<eos> We worked through our stuff and we're good.<eos> Too bad you didn't consider what that meant for me though.
I'm sorry... okay?<eos> You were right.<eos> You deserve more.<eos> But I-I was... hopin' that we can move past that and be friends again.<eos> Like how you and Jordan are friends again?<eos> We worked through our stuff and we're good.<eos> Too bad you didn't consider what that meant for me though.<eos> What does that have to do with you?<eos> Wake up, Rainer.<eos> As long as you and Jordan are friends Jordan thinks that we can't be anything.
I blame yesterday on Alexis.<eos> 'By the way, she tweeted this morning' how the desert air is healing her sinuses.<eos> - Totally covered her ass.<eos> - That's such a lie.<eos> I know, right?<eos> You know what, I'm gonna call her out.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm starting a Twitter war.<eos> 'Don't worry, she won't know it's me, I have, like' 'seven fake accounts.'<eos> Unless you don't want me to.
Not anymore.<eos> No.<eos> No, now we're doing it my way.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Okay, so then I tweeted how her last movie bombed and then she tweeted that I was a nobody hack and then I tweeted how everyone knows she isn't even sick.<eos> Paige, are you hearing any of this?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, uh, big scene coming up.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> And it's good, right, that you and Rainer cleared the air before the big kissing scene.
His father just became head of the studio.<eos> - So what's your deal?<eos> - Set PA Adam.<eos> - 'At your service.'<eos> Take your money and get out of here.<eos> I'm telling you that's not mine.<eos> 'Ma'am, step out of the vehicle now.'<eos> Remember, we agreed on 50 more bucks?<eos> I need the money for school.<eos> I'm so glad you decided to celebrate our little victory after all.
Oh, hey, uh, did the three diamond bracelet ever come back from the jewelers?<eos> I should probably wear it to dinner.<eos> Um, yeah, no, I just checked on it the other day 'and he was still resizing it' but that was a few days ago, so I will check again.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll go make us some coffee.<eos> But I sold it for $2000.<eos> Why is it now three?<eos> 'Sorry, honey.<eos> That's how the pawning works.'<eos> 'You sell it to me at a discounted rate' 'and I upsell it.'
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> I've been bailing you out my whole life.<eos> I just handed you 50K for your nail salon in Tucson and you still land here on drugs.<eos> I've been clean for months, Jordy.<eos> - Don't call me Jordy.<eos> - My apologies, Jordan Wilder.<eos> May I have your autograph?<eos> That coke wasn't mine.<eos> And if you didn't plant it, then that bitch you was with did.
- Nothing.<eos> Didn't trust her.<eos> - Good.<eos> But she did put me in touch with someone I might trust.<eos> I trust Barrett Hopper would be willing to invest 5K into bailing me out and, uh, that type of generosity motivates all kinds of talkin'.<eos> Honey, pack your bags.<eos> We're going to Hong Kong.<eos> You know I love egg drop soup, mother but not enough for a 15-hour flight.<eos> I need to convince our Chinese distributors to uphold their agreement to release "Locked".<eos> And you, my son, are the face of it.
Rain, if those plans involve your standard silicon implants and hair extensions, cancel.<eos> The plane leaves in three hours.<eos> I can't believe you're springing a 15 hour flight at me at the eleventh hour.<eos> Well, I'm a suit.<eos> And suits don't care about other suits.<eos> But you, you're the face of "Locked" and a huge star in China ever since "Dragons in the Sand" was released.<eos> What about hiring Jordan for his international sales?<eos> Take him as your carry-on if he is so valuable in the foreign market.<eos> Jordan's an important part of the movie, but..<eos> You're the first face they'll see on the poster.
I checked her favorite spot on the fourth floor library.<eos> I checked the coffee shop, the quad..<eos> Where could she be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wow, feels like forever since I've hung out here.<eos> I miss this.<eos> ♪ Can't forget ♪<eos> - Is it Cassie? - Uh, no.<eos> Whatever it is, it must be pretty important 'cause it keep blowing up your phone all mornin'.<eos> I hate to ask you, but are you and Alexis like a thing now?
She hasn't posted anything on Insta or Snap.<eos> Maybe it's not about this.<eos> Maybe it's more about the movie.<eos> What? That I got the role?<eos> If it weren't for her, you wouldn't have even auditioned.<eos> A-and now she is obviously having money issues.<eos> What about you?<eos> You're the one off selling your scripts and hanging out with starlets in the desert.<eos> 'Hey, okay.'<eos> Look, I-I just feel you've been a little...
So maybe not.<eos> How do you know I ain't already eaten?<eos> Because I know your go-to breakfast is coffee and cigarettes.<eos> I gave up smokin'.<eos> You and I pulled enough cons.<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> Besides, breakfast wasn't in your mothering handbook.<eos> Or lunch.<eos> Or dinner.<eos> I was a good enough mother to go to jail for five years for something you did.
- What can I say?<eos> I'm a sucker for a great romance. - Wow.<eos> - We gotta get going.<eos> But it was so good meeting you.<eos> A-awesome meeting you guys.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks, thank you so much.<eos> - Wow.<eos> This is one of the biggest stages on the lot.<eos> Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Carrie Grant they all made movies right where you're standing.
- I'm gonna go grab the car.<eos> - Great. - Are you two..<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We were just working on the script and came straight from the office.<eos> Well, I'm so glad to have you on this project as a producer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Which leads me to our next piece of business.<eos> The casting of your co-star is going to be crucial to getting this made.<eos> Here is our list.<eos> We're hoping you might have relationships with some of those actresses.
I need to talk to you.<eos> It's an emergency or I wouldn't be here.<eos> It's always an emergency.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Baby, listen, I'll tell you what you need to know, but not now.<eos> All those times you told me how sad you were that you don't have your parents.<eos> Jordan, you've lied to me.<eos> God!<eos> I hope you're happy.
I mean, she was so excited all the time<eos> I just figured.. ...she was okay with all of it.<eos> She is excited for you.<eos> I don't know but maybe she's right.<eos> Maybe I didn't deserve any of this.<eos> The film, the role, just... any of it.<eos> No, it's not it.<eos> You deserve it, Paige.<eos> So take that part out of the equation.<eos> That's math you can probably do.
Tangey, nobody knows you or your career better than me.<eos> And what with the press having' a field day..<eos> ...over why you were replaced.<eos> You don't have the luxury of time to hire somebody else.<eos> I didn't ask for your help.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Listen, Tange, I know you're grown.<eos> And I know we have had our differences.<eos> So you ask yourself as much as you've hated to hear the truth.
Nina owes me.<eos> She promised me you would be on this film.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> She didn't even have the guts to tell you herself.<eos> They're paying me.<eos> Of course, they're payin' you!<eos> And they'll do a whole lot more than that.<eos> Now shut the door.<eos> We gotta sit down and get ready for our meeting.<eos> I don't want you to be my manager anymore!
What's up is that you're supposed to be rehearsing that dance number with me.<eos> Rainer, I can't afford to screw this up.<eos> Okay? So...<eos> I guess what I'm asking you is to stop, stop blowing me off.<eos> Like how you blew me off in Vegas?<eos> 'Oh.'<eos> For a friend crisis, which honestly didn't seem like much of a friend crisis at all.<eos> Considering all the missing friends were present and accounted for.<eos> So that's it then, huh?<eos> First time I say no to you, this is how you treat me?
You gotta be generous with each other to make this dance come to life.<eos> Which means..<eos> '...you gotta feel what the other one needs.'<eos> Where do y'all wanna take it from?<eos> I think I need more work than Paige.<eos> Let's take it from the top.<eos> Five, six, seven, eight..<eos> I like it.<eos> Wanna come in?<eos> But what I like even more is that you're the producer.
So I can get you back on this movie is what.<eos> We all agree that the script needs a little more work before we can move to green-light the project.<eos> I thought Mike Tanen loved the script?<eos> I've got Kevin O'Hare the Pulitzer Prize winning playwright to agree to do a full rewrite.<eos> Why are you dealing with Aidan's bookie?<eos> Because every debt Aidan owed, I now owe.<eos> And if I don't pay back all the money they're gonna kill me.<eos> When Brandy Michaels needed bail money she was pretty eager to chat.<eos> So, what, you're just gonna hate your best friend now that I-I got it?<eos> Because I didn't think that you would but you just waltzed right in and you got it, like everything you do.
- It's not up to us.<eos> At least, this way, I'll be here with them.<eos> But I'm their mother.<eos> Cut! Cut! Cut!<eos> - Go in close on Rainer.<eos> - Going in tighter.<eos> Make it quick, folks.<eos> Still dry, Townsen?<eos> You couldn't shut off the waterworks before. What gives, Paige?<eos> You know, Wyatt, you have a real way with actors.
On it.<eos> Oh, and Xu Yifei's entire family is coming to visit.<eos> She wants to know if they can do the lot tour next Thursday.<eos> You backstabbing bitch.<eos> Didn't see you on my schedule, Ida.<eos> Sorry, she was next on my list...<eos> Just go.<eos> Ida, you were going to be my first call.<eos> Oh, well, now you can tell me to my face what the hell happened?<eos> Listen, I understand why you're upset, but... Upset?
I'm sorry, but this decision is above your pay grade.<eos> When are you guys letting Jake know he's off the project?<eos> Actually, Mike and I thought it would be best coming from you.<eos> So you're the guy who's been threatening my mom?<eos> Don Oxley.<eos> I don't make threats. If someone owes me money, I get paid no matter what.<eos> You must know that, otherwise you wouldn't be here.<eos> Are you ready to settle up?<eos> - Brandy doesn't have that... - Then you're wasting my time.<eos> Unless you came to tell me you're assuming her debts?
Hey, Steve, Wyatt needs you at video village.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Take it.<eos> You've got a good arm.<eos> Oh, this old man was once the star quarterback at West Valley High.<eos> You play sports?<eos> Nah, didn't attend a regular school long enough to be on the team.<eos> Well, but you surf.<eos> See, you got a thruster.<eos> - You're a surfer too?
It's about Jake.<eos> I just found...<eos> If you're satisfied with your message, press one now.<eos> _<eos> Congrats on the big news this morning.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You don't sound very excited.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, just...<eos> You didn't happen to say anything to Barrett Hopper about me, did you?
- What?<eos> - I think it's brilliant.<eos> - Really?<eos> It's the one solution that will make everybody happy.<eos> - Look at you!<eos> Producing is in your blood.<eos> Jake...<eos> Alexis?<eos> What? Um, where's Jake?<eos> What are you, what are you doing here?
We're working.<eos> He's in the bathroom.<eos> Want some?<eos> No.<eos> So, I had a meeting at Newcastle today.<eos> Did you know Jake was being replaced on his own film?<eos> So-so you did know.<eos> Well, did you tell him yet?<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't understand what's happening.
Well, did you tell him yet?<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't understand what's happening.<eos> What I do understand is that Jake has been glued to his desk, 24/7, busting his ass on a rewrite that nobody wants.<eos> Okay. Well, the rewrite is in his contract.<eos> He's still getting paid for it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop trying to spin this.<eos> That is my best friend over there... that's about to have one of the most disappointing moments of his life.<eos> All because you sold him out.

Well, the rewrite is in his contract.<eos> He's still getting paid for it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop trying to spin this.<eos> That is my best friend over there... that's about to have one of the most disappointing moments of his life.<eos> All because you sold him out.<eos> Whoa! This is not my fault.<eos> Well, why does everyone assume that if it's evil and if it's happening to Hollywood, it's all me?<eos> Alexis, Jake deserves to know the truth.<eos> If you don't tell him tonight, I will.
One for the American market and one for the Chinese.<eos> - So, Tangey...<eos> - Is our American "Leila."<eos> - She's back in "Locked." - Brilliant!<eos> - I will call her right now.<eos> - Not so fast. - I have one condition.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> You tipped Barrett Hopper off about Brandy Michaels and now he's harassing Jordan.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> You're the one who told me about Brandy in the first place.
We think bringing in a fresh vision will help elevate the material.<eos> If you want to tell a different story, go ahead but don't screw up mine.<eos> I want my script back.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, kid, but we own the property now.<eos> Now, you haven't paid me a dime yet. So, give me my script back.<eos> The deal's already closed.<eos> Mike...<eos> I think we can work something out.<eos> Well, if you'd like, I can have one of my lawyers come and clarify the details for the both of you.<eos> It's all in the contract you signed.
You never even gave me a chance.<eos> I didn't choose to be a single mother.<eos> Nobody chooses that.<eos> But Rainer is the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> And I wasn't the monster you made me out to be.<eos> I had a right to know.<eos> You didn't want kids back then, and you don't have them now.<eos> That doesn't mean he wouldn't have been the best thing that ever happened to me, too.<eos> Rainer can't find out.<eos> You don't get to make that decision.
Wow! Thank you for talking me into that.<eos> So worth it. Loved it.<eos> - Nice job, Townsen.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I think that was my first compliment.<eos> Nice doing business with you.<eos> You don't want to count it?<eos> I know where to find you if there's a problem.<eos> Hey, Jake, um, I'm home.<eos> Where are you?
- Your mother?<eos> Baby, listen, I'll tell you what you need to know, but not now.<eos> Jordan, you've lied to me.<eos> - 'Where are you?<eos> ' - Austin.<eos> 'And it's just an interview.'<eos> And, Paige, if I get this job, I'm taking it.<eos> There she is.<eos> Hey, Paige.<eos> It looks like you and Rainer Devon are quite the item. Um, what?
It's from my agents.<eos> The premier's tomorrow night on the backlot, right?<eos> Yeah, they're pulling all the stops for this one.<eos> Long way from our Teen Choice Award days.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Really. Thanks, Rain.<eos> Means a lot.<eos> You can make it to the premier, right?<eos> Wouldn't miss it.<eos> You and Tangey walking the carpet together?
Uh, no, I've suddenly got<eos> Paparazzi following my every move.<eos> TMZ picked up a photo of us at the restaurant in Malibu.<eos> I was hoping they'd only come after me.<eos> Yeah, well, now they think we're like a couple.<eos> They turn the story into whatever they want.<eos> They always do.<eos> Just don't talk to them.<eos> Eventually, they get bored and go away.<eos> Did you and Cassie work things out?
I can't help feeling like I'm forgetting something.<eos> Just focus on us.<eos> A week in Hawaii, feet in the sand.<eos> I know.<eos> I can't wait, but, uh..<eos> What am I forgetting?<eos> Maggie! Maggie! I-I didn't tell Maggie we're gonna pick her up.<eos> Where is my phone?<eos> I thought I'd put it..<eos> You were my first love, and I want you to be my last.
Hey.<eos> - Power lunch?<eos> - You could say that.<eos> Everyone is very interested all of a sudden in what I do next.<eos> Well, I mean, the Golden Globe nomination is huge.<eos> Yeah, you shouldn't, you know, take that for granted.<eos> Oh, I'm not.<eos> Well, I'll see you around.<eos> Hey, hey, Tange.<eos> I thought you, of all people, would understand this.
Because that's the control freak in you.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> I have never in my life felt so alone.<eos> So unloved, so... betrayed.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You have to know that I love you.<eos> You are my only son.<eos> You're my everything.<eos> Really?<eos> Because you mean nothing to me now.
Don't say that.<eos> You have to know that I love you.<eos> You are my only son.<eos> You're my everything.<eos> Really?<eos> Because you mean nothing to me now.<eos> Hey, Paige, your car and a small army 'of paparazzi are out front.'<eos> They can wait.<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> I want you to come to the premiere with me.
You're not.<eos> Look, with Jake gone, it's different.<eos> You know, I, I can't just stay here feeling resentful of you, it's not fair to you.<eos> But, Cassie, the whole reason why we did this in the first place so that, was that we could do it together, and you're right.<eos> Now, that Jake's gone, it..<eos> I-I-I don't want you to leave me too.<eos> Paige, please don't cry. You're gonna ruin your make up.<eos> I don't care about the make up, Cassie.<eos> I care about you and me and our friendship.<eos> Paige, you shouldn't stay here either.
I believe you.<eos> I know you're not proud of that guy you used to be but, Jordan, I've known you for a long time now.<eos> And you are not that same guy anymore.<eos> I wanna be with you.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I know, okay.<eos> I know about everything that went down.<eos> I know that you and Nina have been hiding it.
- Come on.<eos> Go to rehab, you loser.<eos> Rainer!<eos> Rainer!<eos> We're live at the Gold Brothers Studios where Rainer Devon has literally lost his mind.<eos> Rainer, get off of him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, easy, Rainer!<eos> Rainer!<eos> You're a liar too.
Hey, Cass.<eos> Uh, thanks, but I, I don't need any more boxes.<eos> - Oh, this is for me, actually.<eos> - Why? 'Cause I'm moving in with Adam.<eos> Wait, you're still moving out?<eos> Well, Cassie, you sure that's a good idea?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Well, I don't know. I mean, I have a good reason.<eos> You know, I'm doing it for a job.<eos> Didn't you and Adam just start dating?
- Why? 'Cause I'm moving in with Adam.<eos> Wait, you're still moving out?<eos> Well, Cassie, you sure that's a good idea?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Well, I don't know. I mean, I have a good reason.<eos> You know, I'm doing it for a job.<eos> Didn't you and Adam just start dating?<eos> Okay, Judgy McJudgerson.<eos> 'No, I'm just saying that we're both leaving Paige.'<eos> So, you get to decide what I do?
Wyatt says we've got half a day at best without Rainer before they're going to have to shut down.<eos> We've also got a press junket tonight with the cast that I'm going have to cancel and then everyone will know that the movie's in jeopardy.<eos> And then Barrett Hopper's report is gonna hit the airwaves tomorrow revealing..<eos> What?<eos> That I had an affair with Jordan Wilder.<eos> Rainer doesn't know yet, but when he finds out that... will be it for us.<eos> There's no going back from that.<eos> I wish someone would squash Barrett Hopper like the little cockroach that he is.<eos> Aren't you gonna tell me what a horrible person I am?<eos> Nina, you're like a female version of me.
Do you wanna just put that down, so we can... talk?<eos> Remember that time you told me how much you hated yourself when you were drinking and how that car accident made you realize you could've lost everything?<eos> There's Uber now, Paige.<eos> I can go back to drinking as much as I want.<eos> Come on, Rain, don't dismiss me like that.<eos> You can get a hold of this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> And I'm here.<eos> I'm right here for you.<eos> You're only helping, so I'll go back to the movie and you can be a star.
in the US, in China, on Mars.<eos> Now I don't ever want to hear the name Xu Yifei ever again, okay?<eos> You didn't even want that part, remember?<eos> - Ida wanted it for you.<eos> - And she was right.<eos> I can do both.<eos> And I want it all, Nina.<eos> Movie actress, pop star.<eos> Hell, I might even do something on Broadway next.<eos> So how about you work it out or I tell Barrett Hopper that his next tweet should expose the fact that you have been sleeping with Jordan Wilder since he was underage.
You need to get him in the right mindset for this.<eos> He won't talk to me.<eos> No, I'm not really sure what I can do, Nina.<eos> Well, he likes you.<eos> He'll listen to you.<eos> If we don't put on one hell of a good show out there our investors who are on the fence they're not coming back.<eos> Okay.<eos> When you're up there and they're asking questions, just be positive.<eos> The film is great.<eos> You and Rainer are happy.

I'm not saying you have to lie.

I'm not saying you have to lie.<eos> You do like each other and just..<eos> Show some unity.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> What kind of lies did she want you to spin?
- You too, Meg.<eos> - What about you?<eos> What if you had to pick one person to die?<eos> Meg or Elizabeth? - What if it was between you and Meg?<eos> Would you want Meg to die?<eos> Answer the question honestly.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would want her to die instead of me.<eos> Whoa.<eos> What if both Meg and Elizabeth had to die, in order for you to live?
Well, yesterday, we finished the Revolutionary War so today we're gonna start on the 1800s.<eos> No. I mean, why are you masquerading - as a history teacher?<eos> - I'm not masquerading.<eos> I give a lot of homework. And pop quizzes, right?<eos> You're the best teacher at this school.<eos> Are you mind-controlling these kids?<eos> I made them love history. Is that a crime?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Before you try to attack me, or call the police, or ask anyone for help, just know that if you do, none of these kids are gonna make it to their next class.<eos> Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what you want?<eos> Sure. If we skip to the part where you admit that you would rather be doing anything except think about what Stefan's doing right now.
- Please. Come closer.<eos> Please.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I was never... a drunk driver.<eos> Sorry, Damon.<eos> You're too weak to convince her otherwise.<eos> Tara.<eos> Show him I'm right about you.<eos> Give me a chance to redeem myself.<eos> No matter what you do, her parents will still be gone.
Then one night he gets behind the wheel, causes another accident.<eos> Someone else's parents die.<eos> Or maybe this time it's a couple of kids.<eos> We can't predict the future.<eos> I know, but we can judge the past.<eos> How many times does Damon have to show us who he really is before we actually believe him?<eos> I understand your struggle, I really do.<eos> Trying to be perfect for everyone when all you want to do is make a choice for yourself.<eos> This is not about me.<eos> Yes, it is, because you are in charge.
Yeah, I gotta call you back.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey, hey, listen. Look... you need to back away, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> She's not gonna listen to you. None of them will.<eos> Sybil's controlling them. Help me untie 'em, now.<eos> Not seeing anything bell-shaped.<eos> Looks like you haven't even bothered to open half these boxes.<eos> I didn't have the heart to, but you wouldn't understand that, would you?
He's keeping it together.<eos> Relatively speaking.<eos> Which is a good thing... 'cause things are weird right now.<eos> My brother takes a turn for the worse all bets are off.<eos> Well, well, sometimes people bounce back.<eos> By doing penance, like you?<eos> One wrapper at a time?<eos> It beats leaving 'em on the ground.<eos> Hey.<eos> In case you're right.
- Yeah.<eos> It's filled with blood.<eos> Enzo's.<eos> That's...<eos> Morbid?<eos> Charming?<eos> "A mere symbol of an eternity with you, love."<eos> That seems like one very specific symbol.<eos> Are you sure that's what it is?<eos> I mean, you don't want you to...
You're right.<eos> That is exactly what I need to do.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I hope it hurt.<eos> So this is the new you, huh?<eos> Just slumming it at a pageant for hormonal teenagers?<eos> As if you volunteering at this thing isn't a sad attempt to relive your glory days.<eos> And how would you know what that looks like?<eos> The year I won Miss Mystic Falls, you spent the day in the woods trying not to kill Amber Bradley.
Yeah, I know that.<eos> Why does it mean anything to me?<eos> I hold it and I get this... little flicker of warmth.<eos> And then... it's gone.<eos> What did that woman do to you?<eos> After I flipped my switch,<eos> Sybil tinkered in my head.<eos> I don't know what it was, but she did something to guarantee that all my feelings for Elena went away.<eos> Damon, I gave you that necklace because it is as powerful and as magical as the love that you and Elena have for each other.<eos> Being here and feeling what you're feeling proves that a love that deep and real can win over anything.

_<eos> Allow me to introduce this year's Miss Mystic hopefuls.<eos> Violet Fell, escorted by Ryan Ashton.<eos> I'm ready to get out of here.<eos> You didn't hand over that stupid ball Sybil wants...<eos> Miss Trudy Sulez...<eos> Why do you care?<eos> ...escorted by Garrett Tanner.<eos> Well, because fighting Sybil is keeping you from being the brother that I want.<eos> If this has something to do with me not pulling my weight with Cade, I think you're killing enough for the both of us.
You're finally getting it.<eos> Fighting means feeling, and both are useless.<eos> Your soul is damned anyway, so just give up, give in, and give me what I want.<eos> Stick with me, Damon.<eos> The path of least resistance, I promise.<eos> It will hurt way less than reality.<eos> I hid the striker upstairs.<eos> I'll take you.<eos> - How dumb do you think I am?<eos> - On a scale from Matt to Alaric, you're right in the middle.

What are you talking about?<eos> I just fought Sybil.<eos> I won.<eos> Isn't that the whole reason we came here in the first place was to get this woman out of my head?<eos> Sybil isn't the woman that I was referring to.<eos> Now you have a problem with Elena, who's not even here?<eos> Oh, yes, she is.<eos> She's in your head, more powerful than Sybil, manipulating your every move.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> I've been dealing with you for weeks now, covering your tracks, laying in a hospital bed so you can get your kicks, and now you're ditching me?

Yeah.<eos> You're choosing her over your own brother?<eos> No, I'm choosing myself over everyone else.<eos> I was made for Cade's work.<eos> And, true to form, the minute I become my best self, you have to go ahead and ruin it.
Pretty much. Yeah.<eos> You're choosing her over your own brother?<eos> No, I'm choosing myself over everyone else.<eos> I was made for Cade's work.<eos> And, true to form, the minute I become my best self, you have to go ahead and ruin it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you drag me down with you.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Stefan, what did you do?<eos> I see we're down to our finalists.<eos> You may never win a beauty pageant again, but here's a little consolation prize.
Come on, let's go back.<eos> No, Bonnie, don't.<eos> - It's too dangerous.<eos> - This again?<eos> Enzo, Caroline needs me.<eos> Caroline can better protect you if she's not worried about you in the crossfire.<eos> That's not your decision to make.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> This isn't you. You trust me.<eos> You listen to me.
I can't bear the thought.<eos> And I do listen to you. But I also listen to the world around you, and I'm not afraid to speak up if I fear for your life.<eos> When did you become such a sap?<eos> I fell in love with a human who makes me feel alive.<eos> Unlike you, I can control my bloodlust.<eos> Not all vampires are evil. No.<eos> But we're engaged, Caroline.<eos> That means we're in this together.<eos> You're not just an innocent bystander if you let me kill for Cade.<eos> So unless you want to call the whole thing off, blood is on your hands, too.
See?<eos> You're good at this killing thing.<eos> Did...<eos> Did I win?<eos> Well, the judge did pick you.<eos> I...<eos> I died.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> You're a vampire.<eos> And now, so are you.
So we have to make it count.<eos> No. You're right.<eos> 70 years with the right person can be forever.<eos> It's just the "after" part I'm worried about.<eos> I spent an eternity waiting for you to walk into my life.<eos> What will I ever do without you?<eos> What if it wasn't just my forever?<eos> What if it could be ours?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> What if you could take the cure?
That's not true at all.<eos> I know you spent your life forgotten and abandoned.<eos> Feared and hated.<eos> Hell, anyone who loved you had to be sirened to do so.<eos> I mean, except your sister.<eos> But now even your sibling doesn't want anything to do with you.<eos> Take it from me.<eos> I know how that one stings.<eos> But I know why, after 2,000 years, you have nothing.<eos> Because you are nothing.
Hold on a sec.<eos> You're Henry.<eos> I'm going to have to ask you both to leave.<eos> Now!<eos> Damn it. - What was that about?<eos> - How are we supposed - to know?<eos> - Well, what did Damon say?<eos> He didn't say anything, - because he wasn't there.<eos> - That's impossible. - It's his mind.<eos> - You're the one who did this to him.
I say let him suffer.<eos> I mean, it's weird, right?<eos> If I built a world in my own mind, I would make it a happy place, unicorns required.<eos> But Damon killed Vicki, so why would he want her hanging around?<eos> She's leaving. Come on.<eos> Let's follow her.<eos> I don't think we're the only ones working this case.<eos> I forgot how pretty she was.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll talk to Vicki, you talk to your mom.
Something wrong?<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> My finely-honed detective skills tell me this is probably about a boy.<eos> Uh, you're right.<eos> Uh, Damon Salvatore.<eos> Which one is he?<eos> I know. It's all a little confusing.<eos> Damon was, um... is in the Founder's Council, and he's sort of your best friend.<eos> Or he became your best friend.<eos> Honey, I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you're talking about, or who Damon Salvatore is.
I'd say the vampire I've been looking for is my own daughter.<eos> Caroline?<eos> Bonnie, find Damon.<eos> I'm warning you, Bonnie.<eos> Stay out of this.<eos> Thanks for the call, Matt.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this day.<eos> - I'm not doing this for you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> All I care about is that you're willing to destroy my sister.
Stay out of this.<eos> Thanks for the call, Matt.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this day.<eos> - I'm not doing this for you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> All I care about is that you're willing to destroy my sister.<eos> But you get brownie points for letting me know that she's currently unable to defend herself.<eos> - Just tell me how this works.<eos> - It's easy.<eos> Once your dad finishes welding the bell back together, you or he rings it 12 times.
Stefan Salvatore doesn't have a brother.<eos> I checked the town records.<eos> Damon died a long time ago.<eos> So please just accept the truth, and this will all be over.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> And I'm not leaving here until I find Damon.<eos> Damon is dead!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You are!
And then I got over it.<eos> - What just happened?<eos> - Well, Stefan was right.<eos> Forgiveness is the key to reaching Damon, but just not yours.<eos> I hope your friend has better luck.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> I didn't know if you would be here. Wow.<eos> You even... you even got the sweater right.<eos> You okay, child?<eos> Look like you've seen a ghost.
Aren't I?<eos> Because it's caused me nothing but trouble, and the emotional hold it has over Damon is worse than a Hallmark card.<eos> You're forgetting one small detail.<eos> You need a Maxwell to ring that bell, and I'm not touching it.<eos> Oh, yes, you are, Matt.<eos> And when you do cause the deaths of all those innocent people, I get to mark your do-gooder soul for Cade.<eos> It's a win-win.<eos> Stay away from him.<eos> I'm sorry. Who are you again?<eos> If you compel me, you're making the choice for me, and all that blood will be on your hands, not mine.
You're not here to forgive me, Stefan.<eos> You're here so I can forgive you.<eos> Can't you just... look, I don't know, can't you find a way to forgive Damon?<eos> Not in the next ten minutes.<eos> Probably not ever.<eos> Look, I just... I need you to get out of here.<eos> Go to the cops and save as many people as you can, okay?<eos> There's no reason that both of us have to die.<eos> Me running is the whole reason we're in this mess, Matt.<eos> Here's the difference, Dad. I want you to abandon me this time.
Me running is the whole reason we're in this mess, Matt.<eos> Here's the difference, Dad. I want you to abandon me this time.<eos> 'Cause when I ring that bell, all hell's gonna break loose, literally.<eos> Leaving you and your sister was the biggest mistake of my life, and I'll be damned if I do it again.<eos> No, Dad, you'll be damned if you don't.<eos> Maybe! Maybe, but if you want to ring that bell, Matt, you're gonna have to go through me.<eos> Don't you get it, Dad?<eos> I will go through you.<eos> I'm compelled. I'm ringing that bell!<eos> Unless you kill me.
I'll probably kill you in the process.<eos> Please, Dad.<eos> I'll die a hero.<eos> My life will mean something.<eos> I'm not laying a hand on you, son.<eos> You've been a crap father my whole life. Why stop now?<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> Think of all the ways that you have ruined my life for the last century...<eos> Including the fact that I'm working for Cade right now because of you...<eos> And you seriously believe that you're the one who should be forgiving me?
Dear Bonnie... ♪ And I hope you're better off... ♪ I am a coward.<eos> I should be saying this to your face, not writing this letter, but... I know if I do, you'll talk me out of running away from all my problems.<eos> You're gonna make me face a future without Elena.<eos> Then you're gonna help make me the best man that I can possibly be.<eos> The same way she did.<eos> And I'm absolutely terrified of failing you both.<eos> So I'm leaving.<eos> Because I'd rather let you down once than let you down for the rest of your life.<eos> ♪ Ooh, ooh... ♪ And I hope it's the happiest life.<eos> Because you, Bonnie Bennett, are an amazing woman... a mediocre crossword puzzle player... and my best friend.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> What will I ever do without you?<eos> What if you could take the cure?
Or as many of them as we can.<eos> You need to take full advantage of the perks of your immortality.<eos> While I'm still immortal, you mean?<eos> Exactly.<eos> No time like the present.<eos> Well, except we're on a mission.<eos> We'll still end up at the same destination.<eos> Why not make the journey an adventure?<eos> Second chances, coming up.<eos> I dare you to have one of these and tell me that they are not the best pancakes you ever... had.
Wait.<eos> There's something I've been imagining.<eos> One day we'll do that for real.<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> And thank you for my bucket list day.<eos> - Was it enough?<eos> - It was perfect.<eos> Though the fact that there are endless ways humans will tempt death for their own amusement - never ceases to amaze me.<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> You'll be a stupid human soon.
Look, all we need to do is capture Cade...<eos> You're talking about the devil here.<eos> We give him the cure, he becomes mortal.<eos> Then someone else will take his blood.<eos> That'll make him age 4,000 years and then shrivel into dust.<eos> You realize if you take the cure out of Elena's body, that little vial is our one and only dose.<eos> And we're not even sure it'll work on Cade.<eos> This is our best chance to get Stefan back.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> No, it's what you want.
Before or after they stole it from me?<eos> It doesn't belong to you.<eos> It is in Elena's blood.<eos> She would want to save all of us, and you know it.<eos> Anyway, I've done the math.<eos> It can work.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> It's not about being sure.<eos> It's about using what we've got.<eos> Unless you have a plan âDâ.
If you have better ideas about how to defeat the devil, Bonnie, I'm all ears.<eos> I finally have Enzo, minus all the insanity.<eos> We're gonna start a life together.<eos> We need the cure to do that, and we know it'll work on him exactly as intended, no question marks.<eos> Besides, what if you're wrong?<eos> Then I lose everything, too.<eos> But there's more at stake here than just you or me or Enzo.<eos> You understand what you're asking me to do?<eos> Well, at least I'm asking.<eos> You were just gonna give Enzo the cure without telling me.
- Yes, and no.<eos> She doesn't count.<eos> She was essentially a good woman, and her soul is of no use to me.<eos> But I quite enjoyed watching you work.<eos> I gave you three worthy kills.<eos> You still have 97 to go.<eos> And then you send Stefan home?<eos> Oh, you misunderstand me.<eos> Your quota is separate from your brother's task.<eos> You made your choice, he made his.
Same reason people channel surf when they're bored.<eos> Just passing time while my new friend fills out the paperwork.<eos> Wait, you're doing paperwork? Yep.<eos> She had everything messengered over from the county clerk's office, and I will be on my way as soon as she signs on the last dotted line.<eos> - What are you talking about? - Uh-uh-uh...<eos> You have to notarize that page.<eos> Where's your stamp?<eos> So, Elena's here?<eos> She's the reason you bought this house.<eos> I had her moved from the Brooklyn warehouse after you and Damon went missing... for her safety.
I don't need you shoving your judgment in my face.<eos> I'm just being honest.<eos> I'm hanging on by a thread.<eos> This whole town's hanging on by a thread.<eos> This isn't the town we grew up in anymore.<eos> It's exactly the same as it was back then.<eos> We just didn't know any better because we were kids, playing games and burying old photos.<eos> Adults hid the darkness from us, Matt.<eos> We're the adults now.<eos> And you're part of the darkness.
I chose to be here.<eos> Weird. This last message is in a completely different language.<eos> What's it say?<eos> I have no clue.<eos> It's kind of like Latin, also kind of Gothic...<eos> maybe some old Prussian.<eos> I have to check this, and get some stuff from the library.<eos> Um... oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I was geeking out with the historical society today, and, uh, they found another Maxwell heirloom in the capsule.<eos> You should have it.

I intend to stay that way if I can help it.<eos> Now, unless you're in a hovercraft, you're not gonna catch me in time.<eos> Donovan called in some favors.<eos> NYPD's headed to the warehouse right now.<eos> Well, I'm not on my way to Brooklyn.<eos> Elena is in upstate New York.<eos> What... how is that even possible?<eos> That's where Bonnie hid her.<eos> Where Bonnie hid her?<eos> How would you even know that?
Because I've been too busy taking care of my brother.<eos> You don't have to take care of me... ever again.<eos> I got this. I'm good.<eos> I'll take care of both of us, Stefan.<eos> No, you won't, Damon.<eos> You're not capable of it, but you'll keep trying to interfere with everything as long as we're connected through her.<eos> That is why I want Elena gone.<eos> I swear to God, Stefan, if you hurt her... you are dead to me.<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> I want to cause her death so you can blame me for it... because then you will finally stop trying to save me... and I will be free of you forever.
I'm sure you're brilliant at it.<eos> How much blood should I take?<eos> Does the cure have a minimum dosage?<eos> Do you think this is enough?<eos> Enzo?<eos> Really?<eos> Let go of me.<eos> What do you care what happens to Elena, huh?<eos> In a minute, you're gonna be dead, anyway.<eos> And you're gonna be human.
Step out of the car, now!<eos> Stefan?<eos> Stefan! Stefan?<eos> I didn't even know you were in town.<eos> Yeah, well, Dorian needed my help with something.<eos> Looks like he wasn't the only one.<eos> So what the hell happened?<eos> I don't know, but I'm telling you, I could feel the heat from the flames... hear the screams of all those people burning.<eos> Are you sure it wasn't just a nightmare?<eos> You know, your mind trying to work out that you almost rang the bell and burned down Mystic Falls?
I'll call you when I'm close.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I let myself in.<eos> I came to offer my condolences.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> I doubt that, seeing you're the reason Enzo's dead.<eos> I was referring to your brother.<eos> Our deal was for two immortal souls.<eos> Your friends found a loophole when they made Stefan human, rendering our agreement null and void.<eos> You and your brother are now free.

What are you doing here?<eos> I need to borrow a book, the Maxwell family tell-all.<eos> I'm guessing it's been out of print for a while.<eos> You mean this?<eos> Convenient.<eos> And yes.<eos> Why are you so interested in my family tree all of a sudden?<eos> Haven't been able to sleep lately, and I thought that would do the trick.<eos> What's it to you?<eos> Well, Matt here has been getting visions because of that journal; and you show up looking for it.
We're gonna trigger Matt's visions by inducing a hypnotic state.<eos> If we're lucky, the answer's in his head.<eos> That'd be a first.<eos> The sedative should be kicking in.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Like I'm on the back half of a 12-pack.<eos> That's good.<eos> I want you to focus on the metronome.<eos> And listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> I want you to close your eyes and relax.
To wherever Enzo is.<eos> Somewhere dark.<eos> Filled with suffering and emptiness.<eos> You mean hell?<eos> I don't know, but we need to close that door.<eos> We need to bury him.<eos> If Enzo's in there and we bury him, he'll be trapped.<eos> There must be a way to free him.<eos> No.<eos> Whatever darkness you reached into is reaching back for you.
Bonnie!<eos> I had to!<eos> I had to, baby.<eos> I had to destroy every part of him.<eos> It was the only way to break the connection...<eos> He was trying to reach me!<eos> No, Bonnie.<eos> He didn't open that door, you did.<eos> I have failed you in so many ways as a mother.<eos> But I will not let you destroy yourself.
He was trying to reach me!<eos> No, Bonnie.<eos> He didn't open that door, you did.<eos> I have failed you in so many ways as a mother.<eos> But I will not let you destroy yourself.<eos> He's alone in darkness.<eos> And he wouldn't want to drag you in with him.<eos> You know that.<eos> He loved you.<eos> He wouldn't want you to suffer.
Thank you.<eos> Your brother's free to live out the term of his human life.<eos> I hope he makes the most of his borrowed time.<eos> Just between us bad guys... has anyone ever... earned their way out?<eos> Hmm. I wouldn't want to give you false hope.<eos> - Mom!<eos> I'm so glad you're okay.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> Okay, I got antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and pain meds.<eos> I guess you wouldn't know if you're allergic to anything.
Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saved my brother, Ric.<eos> No apologies.<eos> He's human, and if I'm lucky, I have about 80 something years to make peace with the fact that he's gonna die one day.<eos> All I could do was make sure that day wasn't today.<eos> Why do you only seem to care about loss when it's your own?<eos> Because... say it with me, Ric...<eos> I'm selfish.<eos> You have absolutely no idea... how important that journal was.
But... in all that blathering, she did mention that she had an insurance policy against Cade.<eos> I'm betting this is it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How sure are you?<eos> 60/40.<eos> But a relic of Cade's creation, that is the means to destroy him?<eos> Now, that has a certain poetry to it.<eos> Ah. Admit it.<eos> I did pretty good.<eos> Now... you got to have a bottle of bourbon stashed in here somewhere.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> - You just killed your whole family?<eos> - Who names a kid Malachi?<eos> Like they expected me to be evil.<eos> I linked Elena's life to yours, and the rule is, as long as you're alive, Elena will remain asleep.
I think I'm on the wait list for heaven, but they're not returning my calls.<eos> You said you had a better idea than killing Cade with this dagger.<eos> Find a way to get me out of hell, all the way, and then I'll help you kill Cade.<eos> I think we can manage without you.<eos> What if I brought back Elena?<eos> Let's hear him out, Ric.<eos> The kid's a sociopath.<eos> - You're gonna get us all killed.<eos> - Not necessarily.<eos> Then have at it, Damon, and while you're trying to outsmart the devil, I'm gonna barricade myself in here with my two girls, who, in case you forgot, Kai tried to murder
'Cause yesterday I woke up, and started to remember.<eos> Remember what?<eos> The first time we've met.<eos> It was at the Armory a few months ago.<eos> Like you said, we barely know each other, so it's probably news to you that I lost my father and my sister in a house fire seven years ago.<eos> Never came up.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> Because that's not what really happened.<eos> That's the story, the lie, that started to unravel over these last few days when I remembered... that you were there.

I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry's not gonna cut it.<eos> Start digging.<eos> Enzo. Enzo, please hear me.<eos> I don't have access to magic, so you got to meet me halfway.<eos> Please.<eos> A sign.<eos> Anything.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Just calling to make sure you're okay.
And what if the very... small price to pay was us freeing a soul from hell?<eos> First of all, by "us,"<eos> you mean me.<eos> Who's sitting next to you?<eos> - Nobody. - Really?<eos> Because I just had the weirdest feeling.<eos> There's someone there with you.<eos> Someone you don't want me to know about.<eos> Look, let me be clear.<eos> Even if there were someone else here with me, I wouldn't want you to know, because of a certain mind-reading devil that's on the lookout for escaped souls.
And I am trying to keep it together right now because I'm the only person who can clean up this mess.<eos> Well, you have me right where you want me.<eos> Whatever you want to happen is gonna happen.<eos> But have you really thought this through?<eos> Since my memory came back, it's all I've been able to think about.<eos> Don't do this, Dorian.<eos> Not for me, for you.<eos> What is that supposed to be, reverse psychology?<eos> I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> And you're not a vampire, so you can't tell me what to do.
You don't get to walk around trying to do good!<eos> What else am I supposed to do?<eos> You're supposed to go to hell.<eos> Permanently.<eos> Believe me, I am.<eos> I'm just trying to atone for as much as possible before that day comes.<eos> Who gives a crap about your redemption?<eos> ! The damage is done, Stefan!<eos> The dead are dead.<eos> How am I supposed to move on knowing you're alive?
Uh, I'm hoping just for the night, sweetie.<eos> Maybe longer.<eos> Thought you were hunkering down.<eos> Care to explain why Twitter just notified me that CobraKai1972 is tweeting for the first time in four years?<eos> From a diner?<eos> Better question, why are you still following him?<eos> - Damon...<eos> - Don't worry. Bonnie's on it.<eos> Oh, good, you roped her in too.<eos> I was hoping you'd maximize the collateral damage...
Lactose intolerance.<eos> Can we just have some napkins please? Thanks.<eos> Oh, it feels like I'm being dragged back to hell by my colon.<eos> Oh, I can't go back there.<eos> You're on fire all the time, and ghosts from your past come back to pull your skin off, and occasionally, on really bad days, you go face-to-face with Cade, who is basically torture incarnate.<eos> This is all metaphorical.<eos> Except for the fire, which is literal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That sounds rough.<eos> Wait, wait, didn't you go there?
Mystic Falls isn't 100% safe yet.<eos> Well, maybe 100% isn't a realistic goal.<eos> Well, we still need to keep them safe.<eos> Oh, we will.<eos> It'll be good to come home.<eos> And I'll need some good parenting advice.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, I'll explain when I see you.<eos> Stop looking at me.<eos> I'm guessing you never shot anyone before?
How did I know I'd find you here?<eos> Simple.<eos> We share a kinship now.<eos> An awareness of each other.<eos> For someone new to the gift, you're quite powerful.<eos> I don't feel powerful.<eos> I don't understand any of this, but I just have to know...<eos> How do I get Enzo out of hell?<eos> Why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> I hope you're not planning on setting me on fire.
Are you gonna teach me how to contact Enzo?<eos> I'm going to give you an understanding of what you've become.<eos> You've had a powerful, traumatic awakening, just as I did.<eos> My true self sprang forth at the moment of my death.<eos> Along with hell and eternal suffering.<eos> I'm as much a part of my psychic dimension as it is of me.<eos> And so if you wish to locate Enzo's soul, you must open your mind to me.<eos> Together, we may contact him.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I want you to remember the moment of Enzo's death.
I feel a little better.<eos> Emphasis on "little."<eos> If you want to keep this train going to Elenatown, you're gonna need to find me some more evil people to eat.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> Holding.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Because I'm not done with you.<eos> I've been wondering what happened to Enzo's spirit since the moment of his death, and, finally, I have my answer.<eos> When Enzo died, you screamed.
I've hurt people for the wrong reasons, too.<eos> But that feeling in your gut?<eos> That voice telling you to hate yourself for what you did?<eos> That's not a bad thing.<eos> That means you're a good person.<eos> What are those?<eos> Police files on Stefan Salvatore.<eos> Going back decades.<eos> Crime reports, forensics tying him to dozens of murders and cold cases.<eos> He wants you to have them.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> No.<eos> Ow. Don't hurt Mommy. Incendium!<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Shh. You could really hurt somebody.<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> I gave him the cure.<eos> He's human now.

Are you gonna teach me how to contact Enzo?<eos> I'm going to give you an understanding of what you've become.<eos> I want you to remember the moment of Enzo's death.<eos> When Enzo died, you screamed.
Oh, speak of the devil.<eos> The devil.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Your body is spent.<eos> Right now, you're in the space between spaces.<eos> On death's literal doorstep.<eos> Call it limbo, if you must.<eos> No, that makes sense.<eos> Kai siphoned me like a juice box.<eos> Why are you here?
The one weapon that can kill me.<eos> Well, you're out of luck, because I don't have it.<eos> And last time I checked, I wasn't your errand boy anymore.<eos> What happens if I refuse to play fetch?<eos> In layman terms?<eos> - I drag your soul to hell.<eos> - Go for it. I'd rather burn than serve you for another second.<eos> I believe I have something that will change your mind.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> There's nothing you can say.
- It didn't end well.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Kai's dead.<eos> - Ish. He's alive enough to screw me over, and kidnap Elena's coffin.<eos> - Then he turned her over to Cade.<eos> - Apparently.<eos> But Kai being Kai, he tried to cheat the devil.<eos> Kept an ace up his sleeve, and now Cade wants that, too.<eos> In exchange for Elena.<eos> Putting aside the fact that you were gonna blow out of town without having an epic bro moment, I hope wherever you're going can wait.

"Love this place.<eos> Microphone emoji.<eos> Fireball emoji."<eos> Yeah, what can I say?<eos> I'm a sucker for second chances these days.<eos> Ever since Cade gave me a new lease on life in exchange for your box o' ex-girlfriend.<eos> Which... I assume that's why you're here.
Care to elaborate?<eos> Given what you just dragged in, I think you should be the one explaining.<eos> Sorry, Blondie.<eos> Probably safer - if you don't get involved.<eos> - Great.<eos> Another Salvatore brother freezing me out.<eos> Stefan told me that he needed to go on some spirit walk to God knows where, figure out if he wants to be with me.<eos> Well, in his... tiny human brain, I'm sure he thinks he's protecting you.<eos> He doesn't believe he's worthy of someone like you, Caroline.<eos> You felt that way about Elena.
A perfect little witch who would do spells and make things float, and people would clap.<eos> Oh, Josie! Yes!<eos> And I was the kid walking around like an addict, fiending for a hit like I was on fire all the time.<eos> And they didn't understand it.<eos> So they isolated me.<eos> Couldn't even touch anyone.<eos> That screwed me up big-time.<eos> How do we fix them?<eos> Well, I chose to become a sociopath with a penchant for murder and mayhem.<eos> But I take it you might want to steer them in a different direction?
A heroic effort.<eos> But it seems your bell stopped ringing.<eos> I miss this kind of violence.<eos> It's personal.<eos> Direct.<eos> Now you know what I always have.<eos> The human mind is weak.<eos> And its flesh is even weaker.<eos> We had a deal, Cade.<eos> Our deal was that you would bring me the dagger in exchange for Elena.
Who is it going to be?<eos> I suggest you answer soon, or the flames will make the decision for you.<eos> - Damon, you know what to do.<eos> - No. - I can't.<eos> I'm not saying the words.<eos> - Fine. Then I will.<eos> Cade, take me.<eos> Enough from the angel on his shoulder.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, Damon.<eos> This exact choice has defined your life since the moment you and your brother first laid eyes on Elena.
I'm intrigued.<eos> Well, act now, because it's a one-time offer.<eos> Are you aware of what you're offering me?<eos> My soul.<eos> In eternal anguish.<eos> Twisted, black and delicious.<eos> Just like you like 'em.<eos> So, come on! Eat me!<eos> I'd like nothing more.<eos> But it requires you being dead.
Makes you pretty brave in my book.<eos> The brave thing to do is stay.<eos> How can I?<eos> I have to pay for what I've done.<eos> In my wretched, miserable life, I have inflicted a fantastic amount of pain.<eos> I don't think my slate will ever be clean.<eos> But I don't need some spirit journey with a bunch of strangers to convince me that my redemption is within reach.<eos> I just need the people I love.<eos> The list is short, but profound.<eos> You're right at the top, alongside a great girl I hope to marry one day.
I just spoke to Kai.<eos> You didn't destroy hell.<eos> In fact, thanks to you killing Cade, hell's never been in better hands.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If Cade's not running hell, who is?<eos> Think of the only person worse than Cade.<eos> Think of the only person worse.<eos> The person who knows where all your weak spots are.<eos> Who wants to hit you there over and over again.<eos> Who will stop at nothing to make sure that you and everyone you love suffer.
If Cade's not running hell, who is?<eos> The person who knows where all your weak spots are.<eos> The one who wants revenge for what we did to her.<eos> Don't you dare say that name!<eos> The baddest bitch of all.<eos> Katherine.<eos> _<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you part of my Uber pool?<eos> Oh, my God, you're...
Then why haven't we seen her yet?<eos> I thought by now she'd be strutting around, making demands, or trying to get us all killed.<eos> Maybe she's biding her time.<eos> Or putting her own plan together.<eos> Either way, you're gonna need a new weapon.<eos> Is that Dorian?<eos> Yeah, I've asked Dorian to take point on our research front.<eos> This doesn't mean you and I are cool.<eos> I still have those files on you, so I'm here to hold you accountable for the rest of your God-given life.<eos> I hope that you do.
What are you talking about?<eos> Look at the path that she sent us down.<eos> Ripper sprees, the Originals, the cure, Silas,<eos> - the Other Side... - I'm just saying that... Prison worlds, Gemini twins, Heretics, and don't get me started on doppelgangers!<eos> I'm just saying we had some good things happen to us, too, right?<eos> That's very glass-half-full of you, brother.<eos> Well, I have to think that way, otherwise I go - to a very dark place.<eos> - All right, all right, before this turns into a sob-fest.<eos> Happy bachelor party, little brother.<eos> Oh, you can celebrate with us, too.
That is a $10,000 rug.<eos> Perhaps you should consider a less melancholy playlist.<eos> Helps me stay connected to you.<eos> You don't need pain to keep our connection alive.<eos> You are a witch, after all.<eos> A witch who can't do magic.<eos> What do you call my presence, then?<eos> Clearly, I'm not a hallucination.<eos> There has to be magic involved;<eos> therefore, you don't need pain.
I know.<eos> I hate that she is not here.<eos> And Bonnie's not coming, my girls can't be there,<eos> Elena won't be there. Hold that thought.<eos> So, I remember when you gave me this... at Christmas.<eos> You said it was for future me.<eos> A guy who'd one day ask for your forgiveness.<eos> Is this you asking?<eos> Let's save that for another Salvatore bonding night, why don't we?<eos> I just wanted you to know that Elena would be with you tomorrow.
I gave it to Stefan already.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Honestly, no.<eos> Maybe I should hold onto that.<eos> No, I'm the bait.<eos> Hey.<eos> Know this. If she lays a hand on you, I will cut her up into tiny, little pieces and I will serve her at the wedding buffet.<eos> Hope I get to see you have this one day with Elena.<eos> A wedding, a human life... all of it.<eos> I want you to be there, too, brother.

I'm sure he'll be here soon.<eos> By the way, I think you may have gone a little bit overboard with the number of compelled guests.

He had killed my first wife.<eos> Then I found out he had turned her, and that was what she wanted.<eos> Eventually, I got past that.<eos> How?<eos> I guess I didn't have the energy to hate somebody forever.<eos> We've all made... terrible mistakes in our lives.<eos> Done things that... no apology can heal.<eos> But you just have to keep going.<eos> Try to find some new happiness.<eos> No matter how much you've lost.
Yep.<eos> Speak right now.<eos> Anyone?<eos> As in... now.<eos> Right now.<eos> Well.<eos> Well, it seems like no one's objecting, so we will continue with the ceremony.<eos> We will?<eos> You betcha.<eos> Do you, Stefan, take this lovely woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Anyone?<eos> As in... now.<eos> Right now.<eos> Well.<eos> Well, it seems like no one's objecting, so we will continue with the ceremony.<eos> We will?<eos> You betcha.<eos> Do you, Stefan, take this lovely woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Caroline, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?
Now it's a wedding.<eos> Well, I've known Stefan Salvatore for years, but I can honestly say I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.<eos> And then, there's little Mrs. Perfect. Aw.<eos> Too mad your mother's dead. Maybe if you hadn't tried to cure cancer, she might have lived to see this.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah. That's enough.<eos> Hey.<eos> Now go find the open bar. No.<eos> Damon.<eos> You're worse than either of them.
Katherine is gonna save...<eos> Damon! Relax.<eos> Just testing a theory.<eos> Wait for it...<eos> Yep, she's deader than a doornail.<eos> And I'll just keep coming back, again and again.<eos> You need to convince her to stop ringing this bell.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Fate of Mystic Falls lies with you - and your family, so get on it.<eos> - And where are you going?
Should I place my bets now?<eos> Well, that shut her up.<eos> We're running out of time. We have to find Elena.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where's my granddaughter?<eos> Where's Tiki? - Dad!<eos> - Matt!<eos> I heard the bell. And then when they said we had to evacuate...<eos> I need you to get in a van so they can transport you to Grove Hill.<eos> Wait, but if you're not the one ringing the bell, then... then what's the problem?
I ever needed right inside me.<eos> Now give me a little luck.<eos> Right here.<eos> I made it, as promised.<eos> Any word from Stefan?<eos> Listen, we have to leave quickly.<eos> I'll explain everything to you in the car, okay?<eos> Come on, girls, let's go. Run to the car. Run to the car.<eos> I'm gonna save the world.<eos> And you need to get in that car and drive away.
She's done it once or twice, and my money's on her.<eos> We're talking about hellfire.<eos> So intense, it could obliterate anything within miles.<eos> What the hell is Bonnie gonna do?<eos> She's 30 minutes away.<eos> If you take the highway around the mountain, sure.<eos> But as the crow flies, it's only seven miles which is the beauty of these tunnels.<eos> Did you know that they go from the Armory straight into the heart of downtown Mystic Falls?<eos> Man, I bet you didn't know that, did you?<eos> You think Bonnie Bennett can magically draw hellfire through the tunnels away from the town?
Yes, you are.<eos> Are you seriously gonna sit here and argue with me about who needs this redemption more? !<eos> You're not responsible for Enzo, Stefan!<eos> You keep saying that, but you're wrong.<eos> We're all responsible for our own actions.<eos> Every drop of blood that I've spilled, I am accountable for.<eos> Then I'm accountable, too, and I've spilled even more.<eos> Damon, I'm human.<eos> In 60 years, I'm gonna be old, I'm gonna be dead.<eos> You have quite literally an eternity with Elena ahead of you.
Hi, honey.<eos> Is this Matt's trump card?<eos> Well, it won't work.<eos> You're about 15 years too late to be paternal.<eos> I'm not here to talk you out of it.<eos> Oh, well, that's rich.<eos> What, did you come to watch me blow myself into oblivion?<eos> Vicki, Bonnie has a plan.<eos> I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.<eos> We don't need you to stop.
I don't know what to say, Caroline.<eos> Stefan, he's... he's made a decision.<eos> Okay, Grams, if I ever needed you to hear me, hear me now.<eos> Stop the car.<eos> I said stop!<eos> Hey, it's Stefan.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Stefan, please call me.<eos> Please.<eos> I need you to know that I understand.
Stefan, please...<eos> Burn in hell.<eos> Good-bye, brother.<eos> No, Stefan.<eos> Tonight I saw a side of Damon that I hadn't seen in a while.<eos> The older brother I looked up to.<eos> The son who enlisted in the Civil War to please his father.<eos> The Damon I knew when I was a boy.<eos> I wanted that Damon to live.<eos> And I wanted you to have an opportunity to get to know him.
Saying good-bye.<eos> This life will be good and beautiful.<eos> But not without heartbreak.<eos> In death comes peace.<eos> But pain is the cost of living.<eos> Like love, it's how we know we're alive.<eos> Do you think it exists?<eos> I do.<eos> We'll see him again.<eos> You'll see him again.
What is it, Mum?<eos> I... was wrong.<eos> I wanted to prove to you that Chloe wasn't worthy of you.<eos> I gave her every incentive to turn on you.<eos> But she didn't.<eos> She impressed me.<eos> I'm starting to understand what you see in her.<eos> But, uh, regardless, it's a moot point.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because what you couldn't destroy, I did all on my own.
*LUCIFER* Season 02 Episode 11 "Stewardness Interruptus"<eos> Doesn't seem to be a mugging.<eos> Cash, credit card, keys, all still here.<eos> - Can you look for her phone?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> I don't think I deserve the term.<eos> We hardly knew each other, really.<eos> So a woman showed up to your house for sex and you barely knew her?
All sent from the same number.<eos> This last one, just before she got to your place.<eos> "Ditch the loser from Lux"?<eos> Oh, this is terrible.<eos> She was seeing someone else at Lux?<eos> I think it means you.<eos> The number on Jana's cell belongs to a wealthy Silicon Valley guy, Andy Kleinberg.<eos> We tracked his phone's GPS to some swanky Malibu beach house.<eos> I'll send you the address, Chloe.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
So fit.<eos> This isn't good.<eos> What, that a man was one of my lovers?<eos> Come now, Detective, it's the 21st century.<eos> It's not that, it's that you slept with both victims.<eos> We've been trying to find a connection between the two, and so far all we have is you.<eos> Well, I wish I could help you.<eos> What, you didn't get details between the sweet nothings?<eos> Quite a few, actually.<eos> But they were mostly about what he desired, which I doubt you want to hear.
Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mm. I underestimated you.<eos> I gave you all the reason in the world to betray Lucifer.<eos> You did.<eos> During that case you went to incredible lengths to hurt Lucifer.<eos> I did nothing of the sort.<eos> You took that case just to try and get me to call Lucifer a liar in court.<eos> True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.<eos> I was trying to prove that you weren't worthy of him.
I did nothing of the sort.<eos> You took that case just to try and get me to call Lucifer a liar in court.<eos> True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.<eos> I was trying to prove that you weren't worthy of him.<eos> I see.<eos> What about the other women that you don't think are worthy of him?<eos> What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.
Perhaps at first.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> I'm glad he found someone.<eos> He deserves a woman like you in his life.<eos> Have you slept with him yet?<eos> What?<eos> See?<eos> Where were you the night of the 27th?<eos> Hey, listen, man, you're not gonna, uh... You're not gonna tell Chloe about me and Charlotte, right?
I just realize that self-worth comes from within.<eos> You can't rely on others to validate you.<eos> I don't care what anyone thinks of me.<eos> Of course you do, we all do.<eos> You know, and that's okay.<eos> That's human.<eos> I'm a demon.<eos> I actually think you're more human than a lot of people I know.<eos> Take that back.<eos> Okay, okay, you're a good friend and a great pers...
That's human.<eos> I'm a demon.<eos> I actually think you're more human than a lot of people I know.<eos> Take that back.<eos> Okay, okay, you're a good friend and a great pers...<eos> Demon.<eos> You just need to realize it for yourself.<eos> Not because I said it.<eos> You're saying I'm awesome.<eos> I'm saying that you need to say that you're awesome.
Those three hang out together all the time.<eos> Maybe he knows what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I got it.<eos> Look, I'm gonna send an officer by to get a full statement from you.<eos> Do not leave town.<eos> And abandon Lucifer?<eos> Never.<eos> Right, good-bye.<eos> Italian beans.<eos> And you want me to try this because...?
So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?<eos> My two closest friends just got murdered.<eos> I thought I might be next and I was not about to stick around to find out.<eos> Who would try to kill you, Tim?<eos> I only know him as "Burt."<eos> Guy smuggles a lot of drugs into the country.<eos> So, were you moving product for him?<eos> No, he uses young women like Jana to mule.<eos> He recruits 'em on the party circuit in Malibu, offers them cash, free travel, whatever they desire.<eos> Right. And what is it you desire, Tim?
Okay, but you understand what you're agreeing to, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> You want me to bounty hunt this Burt scumbag and pretend to deliver his package.<eos> But we'll need you to work with us on this one.<eos> We'll set up the meet and everything.<eos> Do I still get to rough him up before the cops do?<eos> We'll be close by, but technically, yeah.<eos> More in.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> Because we're running out of time and you're our only option?
Did she now?<eos> So, I suppose you're gonna tell me humans and the divine don't mix.<eos> Luci, listen, I have underestimated you for all of my existence, both in your ability to frustrate me and your capacity for good.<eos> Even though you'll never admit it, but... when it comes to Chloe... perhaps you've been underestimating yourself.<eos> Careful, brother. That sounds dangerously like a compliment.<eos> Ah, take it how you like.<eos> You never listen to my advice, anyway.<eos> Just one of your many charms.<eos> Liar.<eos> But you're not, Luci.
You never listen to my advice, anyway.<eos> Just one of your many charms.<eos> Liar.<eos> But you're not, Luci.<eos> So, if you really want to know if you're a worthy romantic partner... ask yourself.<eos> Can you guys hear me?<eos> Why are you sitting so close?<eos> The killer won't show if this reeks of a setup.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If we were strangers, you'd be hitting on me.
You need to own up to what you did.<eos> Yeah. Be proud of it.<eos> Uh, Maze, we talked about this and besides...<eos> Self-worth comes from within, Dan.<eos> No, I think I'm good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't think you are.<eos> I think you'd feel a lot better if you just came clean.<eos> Don't.<eos> If you won't say it, I will.
Where's the man that paid you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He saw some tall guy with dark hair in a suit.<eos> He took off.<eos> That's Lucifer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Recognized you from the beach party.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tommy Bahama.<eos> It's good that you found me, 'cause I've been meaning to ask you something since then.
Yeah, I don't believe you.<eos> No one says no to a girl like that.<eos> I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, uh, as for your package, Burt... I don't have it.<eos> Liar.<eos> Oh, come now.<eos> Surely a little bit of cocaine isn't worth all the senseless killing.<eos> Cocaine?<eos> What's in that package is far more valuable than drugs.<eos> - It's my ass on the line, and that stupid bitch Jana...<eos> You don't speak of her that way.
Money, drugs, a life of pleasure, but she deserved better than that... better than you... or me.<eos> I mean, what did either of us really give her?<eos> Empty pleasure?<eos> Hey, man... we can work something out.<eos> I'll find the package.<eos> I'll get paid.<eos> We'll...<eos> We're similar in a lot of ways, aren't we, Burt?<eos> Except for one.<eos> You're a bad man and I'm not.
- Yes.<eos> So, from now on, no more attempts at moments.<eos> I'd be honored to, uh, simply continue working by your side... if you'll have me.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's not like you to give up, but...<eos> Oh, no, I haven't given up.<eos> I had a... an epiphany, of sorts.<eos> You deserve someone worthy of you and that isn't me.
- Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's not like you to give up, but...<eos> Oh, no, I haven't given up.<eos> I had a... an epiphany, of sorts.<eos> You deserve someone worthy of you and that isn't me.<eos> That's not what I've been saying, Lucifer.<eos> I know.<eos> It's what I'm saying.<eos> You... deserve someone better because you, Detective, are selfless to a nauseating degree.
That's not what I've been saying, Lucifer.<eos> I know.<eos> It's what I'm saying.<eos> You... deserve someone better because you, Detective, are selfless to a nauseating degree.<eos> You always put your daughter first, even though the ungrateful urchin does nothing to contribute to the rent.<eos> So... you deserve someone worthy of that grace.<eos> Someone who knows that every crime scene breaks your heart, even though you'd never admit it.<eos> Someone who actually appreciates your impossibly boring middle name.<eos> Jane.<eos> More importantly, Detective, you deserve someone as good as you... because... well, you're special and I'm... I'm not worth it.
One of them broke.<eos> I spilled a little on myself.<eos> What the hell is happening to me?<eos> So what if you slept with Charlotte Richards?<eos> You slept with my...<eos> He's different when he's with you.<eos> Chloe Decker is causing your vulnerability.<eos> I'm bleeding.<eos> Do you think I'm boyfriend material?<eos> Perhaps you've been underestimating yourself.
I mean, what kind of sick bastard would do such a thing?<eos> That's exactly what I'd like to know.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Okay, look, we are doing everything we can to trace that e-mail, but in the meantime, did you have any connection to the poisoned student?<eos> Or any idea why he was targeted? No, until yesterday I'd never met him before in my life.<eos> Like that, is it?<eos> Excuse us, thank you.<eos> Fess up. What did you do to her?<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to be more specific. I've done a lot of things to a lot of people by now.
Cyber got a hit off that e-mail trace. Great.<eos> Great.<eos> We traced the e-mail to a grad student named Matthew Hoffing. He works here part-time. Libraries.<eos> Dreary places, aren't they?<eos> They smell like feet.<eos> I don't know. I think they can, be kind of romantic.<eos> Have you ever, you know, made out in a library?<eos> What...<eos> Detective, what has gotten into you today?<eos> This is usually when you tell me to focus on the work.
Was that an earthquake, or did you just rock my world?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You got a boyfriend or something?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Now, I suppose what I'm saying is, you know, how do I know that it's real?<eos> It's real if you're two halves of a whole.<eos> If you're stronger together than you are apart.<eos> Right, right, but what does that actually mean?<eos> Damn it, Lucifer, I was so stupid to think I could actually take a leap and trust you for once.<eos> I mean, a woman's life is on the line and here you are doing...
Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.<eos> Simple, really...<eos> You decide what's more important.<eos> No.<eos> - W-W-W-What are you doing?<eos> - If I don't get in that room right now, that kid is gonna die.<eos> Word of advice, Detective.<eos> If you go into that room right now, you'll die.
You call it biology, call it God, but choice is an illusion.<eos> I didn't have one when I pulled myself out of that burning car.<eos> And I certainly don't have one now.<eos> You'll understand soon enough.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where is Lucifer?<eos> I'm right here, Detective.<eos> See?<eos> I told you everything would be all right.<eos> I'm so glad you're okay.
Whatever it is, I'm sure I can deal with it.<eos> Forget it. Come on.<eos> What?<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> - What?<eos> I've only just got here.<eos> - Go. Go.<eos> We discussed this, Mazikeen.<eos> No.<eos> You discussed this.
And I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.<eos> I thought you understood.<eos> We're doing this for him.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Or are you trying to get back at your ex?<eos> You don't know what you're talking about. I knew<eos> - you were up to something.<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> What's Amenadiel doing with Chloe's mum?<eos> I think you already know.
I killed him.<eos> Where's Uriel?<eos> You look really familiar.<eos> Have we met?<eos> 35 years ago, Father asked me to come down here to bless a couple who was unable to have a child.<eos> God put her in Lucifer's path.<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> Because I just don't know if it's real.<eos> Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal, and other times I'm all too human?<eos> Appears you make me vulnerable.
He liked to brag about how the only place it existed was in his head.<eos> You'd... you'd have to ask him.<eos> Yeah, well, we can't do that.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Um... you still want the painting though, right?<eos> Amenadiel told me about your detective.<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> I can't even go in there. I'd have to tell her how monumentally screwed she is. Or... or lie.<eos> And we both know I can't do that.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, you of all people should know that the man that did this is right where he belongs:
Well, I went down and came back once before, it wasn't a problem.<eos> That's because Father brought you back.<eos> And you didn't go through any of the doors.<eos> Once you do, you could be trapped... forever.<eos> Well, that won't happen, will it?<eos> I'm the Lord of Hell, for crying out loud.<eos> You were the Lord of Hell.<eos> You've been away quite a long time.<eos> You can't be certain that this will work.<eos> What do you think?
Okay, who wants to kill me?<eos> Daniel, there you are.<eos> Have you gathered the ingredients for the antidote yet?<eos> What?<eos> No, I've just been spending time with Chloe.<eos> Besides, those ingredients are useless without the formula.<eos> Well, you might want to hop on it, because I'm about to get the formula.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> Fairly certain you don't want to know.
I also care about your life, Lucifer!<eos> Okay, ice to slow your brain cells from dying, and painkillers to, well, kill the pain.<eos> Got it covered, thanks.<eos> Okay, Maze, just like I showed you.<eos> Yeah, got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> - I can't! You do it.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> No, the deal was you kill him, I bring him back.

Why are there bad people in the world?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> There might be bad people in the world, but you know what?<eos> There's a lot more good people in it.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like all the good people helping out your mom.<eos> Like you?<eos> Well, I'm... I'm trying to be good.<eos> I think you're good.
Could really use my flask right about now.<eos> I never could play as well as you, brother.<eos> Uriel...<eos> I...<eos> I know. It's a lot to take in, isn't it?<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I don't understand, Azrael's blade, it should've destroyed you, not sent you to Hell.<eos> You don't deserve to be here, brother.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But you do.
Where'd you learn to pick a lock like that?<eos> My grandma.<eos> Wow.<eos> And what exactly are we looking for again?<eos> Hey!<eos> You picked the wrong place to rob.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't make it stop.<eos> "It?"<eos> As if you had no part in it.
"It?"<eos> As if you had no part in it.<eos> I don't!<eos> I didn't.<eos> I-I don't want this!<eos> Look at you.<eos> So pitiful.<eos> Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.<eos> Trapped by your own guilt.<eos> And while we're pointing out how lame you are, you didn't even follow up on that thing I told you.
So pitiful.<eos> Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.<eos> Trapped by your own guilt.<eos> And while we're pointing out how lame you are, you didn't even follow up on that thing I told you.<eos> What I whispered in your ear before I died. What?<eos> "The peace is here"?<eos> The peace is here.<eos> I...<eos> I thought that was just nonsense. The... the final ramblings of a dying brain. I...<eos> Unless you're saying you found peace in that moment, brother.
I'm all about patterns, predicting the future.<eos> My last words were a clue.<eos> A clue?<eos> A clue to what?<eos> Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?<eos> After all, I'm just in your head.<eos> I'm just a manifestation of your own guilty conscience.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> No.<eos> I hope you didn't leave any
- He's not real.<eos> - Lucifer!<eos> My sweet boy.<eos> Well. Look who's back.<eos> You didn't die after all.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> I heard you saved me.<eos> Well... much as I'd like to take all the credit, this one was a... a team effort.<eos> You know, this whole poisoning thing has just... really put a pause on everything that's been going on with you and I, so... should we just pick up where we left off?<eos> I think, right now, you just need to focus on feeling better, Detective.
Lucifer.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's me again.<eos> Voicemail 337.<eos> Obnoxious, right?<eos> But, um... It's just that you... you haven't been picking up, or returning my calls, so...<eos> I'm on my way over.<eos> So, hide the strippers.<eos> Yeah, um... I just hope you're okay.
For the last year, I've been attacked from all sides.<eos> Gangsters, feds, even family.<eos> Yeah, speaking of which... ♪ Taking over, that mean we are taking everything ♪<eos> ♪ We gonna make it hot like Inferno... ♪<eos> Nice of you to announce your little project while Jamal's still in rehab.<eos> It must be because you're still threatened by him.<eos> I forgot he was even doing music.<eos> You should have given me the heads-up, Lucious.<eos> Theoretically, we are co-CEO.<eos> Theoretically, you weren't talking to me.
That's for dry snitching, trying to destroy Angelo.<eos> Yeah, you play with me if you want to.<eos> No, I don't play.<eos> I war.<eos> You want war, Cookie?<eos> Fire a shot.<eos> Get ready.<eos> ♪ Potholes are fire pits ♪<eos> ♪ Freddy Krueger your face, ignite your grill ♪<eos> ♪ See, I'm a fire starter, you a fire drill... ♪
- Hey, Ma.<eos> - Jamal.<eos> - You look good.<eos> - Thanks, Mom. - What's up, bro? - What's up, brother?<eos> - What's up, Dre?<eos> - Damn. Tory Ash.<eos> The whole world is still wondering what happened to her ever since she stripped butt naked onstage at Fenway Park.<eos> Show some respect, Hakeem.<eos> The woman has an illness.<eos> Yeah, you would know a lot about that,
Let me get one of them dirty dogs.<eos> - They're Kosher, right?<eos> Gracias.<eos> Ain't nothing like a good pimp steak.<eos> Hand me a couple napkins, will you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you're sure it's about Frank Gathers' murder?<eos> I mean, so says Agent Sweetwater.<eos> And the way I figure it, somebody scored a "get out of jail free" card.<eos> And Tariq got him lined up to testify to a grand jury that you're the one who ordered the hit on Gathers.
Let's go see D-Major and his punk ass.<eos> We got to find him, Lucious.<eos> Yeah, man, you're a genius, man. I want to add a little bit more bass.<eos> Hey, Lucious, I'm glad you're here. I need your ear on this one.<eos> You know the thing...<eos> What the hell? Get off me.<eos> Get... off...<eos> Where's my son, D?<eos> Your son is in rehab, Cookie.<eos> No, he left rehab, and I know you've been supplying him with his drugs.
How you doing, Miss Gretchen?<eos> Oh, I can hardly wait to see my Bam-Bam.<eos> He's such a good son.<eos> He's moving me to a nursing home in Arizona.<eos> That's good. Oh, he's a good boy.<eos> All right.<eos> My Dwight had me locked up in one of those homes for over a hundred years.<eos> Those places are evil.<eos> Okay, okay...<eos> I know damn well you ain't got me out here helping you kidnap these old ladies.
L, man, let me explain.<eos> No, you don't speak.<eos> I speak.<eos> You see, I understand how things happen, Bam.<eos> Me and the Feds both know that every man has his weakness.<eos> And in your case, it's that sweet, loving woman out there that raised you and then raised your little girl when you got locked up.<eos> But when you and I were locked up,<eos> I made a promise to take care of them.<eos> And I did everything I could to help your little girl, but now that she's gone I still kept my word and took care your mama.<eos> The same way you're gonna remember your P's and Q's when you get in front of that grand jury.
And I just dropped off the care package at WZVX.<eos> Check, check and check.<eos> What, am I forgetting something?<eos> You forgetting me.<eos> Are you ser...<eos> You got me driving all over Jersey on these dumbass errands.<eos> When are we gonna talk about my problems though?<eos> All right, you know what? Explain it to me, Hot Pocket.<eos> Why are you still stressing out over that cornball Xavier?<eos> Yo, you don't get it.
Are you a dope fiend?<eos> Look, I got caught up, Ma.<eos> I ain't even trying to run away from that.<eos> But I swear on my music and everything else that I've been fighting back for since I came back from the bullet, I...<eos> I'm done with the pills.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm not even trying to have any kind of substance mess with that.<eos> I'm happy to hear that, baby.<eos> Finally feels like everything's gonna be all right.<eos> You're okay.
Who was your muse for that?<eos> You done, bitch?<eos> Huh, Lucious?<eos> Don't you come any closer.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Who was your muse on that, huh? !<eos> Who was your muse, Lucious?<eos> Oh, do you remember this one?<eos> Because I do.<eos> Yeah, I sent tapes from the inside back and forth with you while you worked on them out here.
Not those plaques!<eos> Not this studio!<eos> None of it!<eos> So you tell me, Lucious.<eos> Tell me whose DNA is running all through it? Huh?<eos> Who's the mother with the important job, Lucious?<eos> ! You tell me.<eos> I gave you three sons, bitch, three sons!<eos> I had a miscarriage.<eos> I went to jail for 17 years so you could build this!

You said Lyons roar? Well, let me hear you roar.<eos> Yeah, I came here to make a lot of noise.<eos> Now you die!<eos> Go home.<eos> I'm just getting started.<eos> Trying to erase me, Lucious?<eos> After all I done for you.<eos> I did 17 years for this family.<eos> You built this company on my back.<eos> And you just gonna give it to that bitch.
See y'all met my crazy-ass friend Tory.<eos> - Why did you leave rehab?<eos> - This is my rehab.<eos> - So Lucious Lyon wins again.<eos> - He murdered Frank Gathers and I can prove it.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> You're off the case 'cause it's closed.<eos> Your new head of AR.<eos> Mrs. Anika Lyon.<eos> You built this company on my back, and you just give it to that bitch?
Behave.<eos> Look, um, how are they doing on the scrubbing of some of that footage?<eos> Well, wax on, wax off, like it never happened.<eos> Good, 'cause Cookie and Jamal are coming after me with this little album of theirs.<eos> I can't have any distractions from Inferno.<eos> Yeah, distractions are bad.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> Don't let her out of your sight.<eos> That means you got to go to the bathroom.

Hi.<eos> Listen, I wanted to see if maybe we could set aside some time to sit down, review the artists and projects.<eos> All right, Smokes Adams' album is done.<eos> Freaky Lyle's* on tour.<eos> Hakeem is directing Tiana's next video that will be on her album that is released next week.<eos> You're all caught up.<eos> Look, Becky, I know that you wanted the job.<eos> But not too long ago, you were Lucious' assistant, and so you might not be exactly ready to run a department.<eos> But listen, I am so excited to work with you.<eos> I feel like you have fantastic people skills.
I'm going to lean on you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I bet in a year or two, you will have my job.<eos> Hey, um, Anika,<eos> I was wondering if you can watch the rest of the rehearsals.<eos> Becky's in charge.<eos> She will be your point person, and she has my full and total support.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anika...<eos> I'm so glad you're back.

Bella.<eos> Bella, baby, Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.<eos> I got to do this for me and you.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> Anika, what the hell?<eos> I was on my way to dress rehearsal.<eos> I'm sorry, look, I know.<eos> I-I need you to take Bella for me, please. I have to go somewhere.<eos> So call Juanita. ‭Juanita is not her father, Hakeem, you are.
Your phone is ringing. Answer your phone.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Campaign manager.<eos> You know who this is, it's Tariq.<eos> Maybe if he puts you in a lockdown situation, you're gonna roll or something like that.<eos> Oh, so I'm supposed to do time again to protect you?<eos> Uh-uh. Wait, wait, what, protect me?<eos> You know, I like the way you blame me for the stuff that you did.<eos> You know, I didn't kick this thing off.<eos> You're the one that ordered everything on the damn menu.
- Can you shut up? - I just had to pay for it.<eos> And I cleaned up after you...<eos> That's what I do. I clean up after all of y'all.<eos> Yeah, you better have.<eos> All right, I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I hope so.<eos> It's the last couple of polls.<eos> What, you trying to scratch your way back into the damn race?<eos> See, you had to scratch your way to power.
Yeah, you better have.<eos> All right, I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I hope so.<eos> It's the last couple of polls.<eos> What, you trying to scratch your way back into the damn race?<eos> See, you had to scratch your way to power.<eos> See, I was born with mine.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Oh, and Mr. Lyon... if I do decide to come for you, you're going to experience a kind of pain that you've never experienced.
I was like, are you crazy?<eos> Do you hear this?<eos> - ♪ We bow down at his feet ♪ - Jamal.<eos> It's just music, man.<eos> ♪ Take back his throne... ♪ You just keep playing with me, man.<eos> No... it's like I don't know what to do with you anymore, man.<eos> Everything...<eos> All right, all right, all right, I get you.<eos> Jamal.<eos> Is this what you and Tory was working on?
Trusted her wack ass.<eos> Trusted her at rehab.<eos> We were like partners at rehab.<eos> I can't even lie. Ah, she was dope. That music was so good.<eos> It was so good.<eos> I can't stand my father.<eos> Oh, that's a laughing matter.<eos> Somebody say they can't stand their father.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> If you see what I see, you'd be laughing, too.
You're still in the closet, anyway.<eos> Those suspicious-looking people over there - are looking for you.<eos> - It's Tariq.<eos> He thinks that you're gonna flip on something.<eos> - I don't know anything about Cookie.<eos> - That's a subpoena.<eos> When Lucious finds out, he'll arrange for you to disappear.<eos> So you can accept the government's protection, or you can take your chances.<eos> Maybe I should go.<eos> Maybe you should stay.
And get up out of my house!<eos> I did what you told me to do.<eos> - What I told you to do? - Yeah.<eos> You said the only reason we're not together is because I'm not living my truth, so I changed all that.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm out of here.<eos> No, wait, Philip. You don't have to.<eos> Hey, you misunderstood me, all right?<eos> Philip, you don't have to go.<eos> Yeah, well, you need to straighten this out.
Okay.<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> No, I just thought that we had decided that, that you were gonna let me handle things like this from here on out, not, not Lucious.<eos> I know, I... I didn't even know what the meeting was about. I thought it was a business thing.<eos> Look, do you or don't you have a connect to find out where they've got Anika stashed?<eos> I'm gonna have to dig.<eos> But before I do my digging, you got to tell me, what are you hiding?<eos> What does Anika have on you?<eos> I'm not hiding anything.<eos> I'm starting to think you don't trust me here, Angelo.
Why do you have it?<eos> Look, possession of a handgun is illegal in New York.<eos> All right, I'm running for mayor here.<eos> I got primaries in ten days... It was a gift, okay?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> I've never used it,<eos> - and I don't plan on using it.<eos> - A gift?<eos> It was a gift from Lucious?<eos> Well, look, I need you to get rid of it.
So I came out.<eos> You don't come out for someone else. You come out for yourself.<eos> And you don't throw my name into the situation, especially when it's on social media.<eos> Man, I am trying here.<eos> It's not like there's some playbook for this, you know?<eos> I'm scared, man.<eos> I got cats turning their back on me.<eos> You know how this hip-hop game is.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm sorry you got to deal with that.
No, it's not all right.<eos> He was your supplier. You're not supposed to be around people who enabled you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't enable...<eos> Boy, you know what I'm talking about. You better back down.<eos> Ma, he has never been my supplier.<eos> Look, we'll, we'll... deal with this another time, all right?<eos> Figure something out together, but right now, - I need to talk to my mom.<eos> - Yeah, he needs to talk to his mother.<eos> Maybe you should go talk to yours.
And what, what, what are you, get...<eos> - What are you doing, Jamal?<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, but the fool came out for me.<eos> And I know it was stupid or whatever on social media, but he feels really exposed right now.<eos> You don't know what that feels like.<eos> I don't give a damn about his feelings.<eos> You better dump his ass before you lose Philip.<eos> Okay, Ma.<eos> Well, how about you drop Dad, before you lose Angelo?
Okay.<eos> You've got 30 seconds to convince us why we should let you live.<eos> Look, I didn't need to be here right now.<eos> I could've gone to Witness Protection and taken Bella with me.<eos> Well, why didn't you?<eos> Because I needed time to formulate a plan.<eos> And now I have one.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> We all know that Tariq is jealous of you.<eos> We know that he wants what you have.

It's kind of hard to explain. You wouldn't understand.<eos> It's just... coming out in the music business, it's like...<eos> It's a lot harder than it would be in the military, right?<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> Maybe you do know something.<eos> Look, what I do know is that... what you and I have could actually be really special.<eos> I'm not interested in D-Major.<eos> I just...<eos> I just think that we could show him a little compassion for what he's going through.<eos> I think you're right.
Why is this not working?<eos> It's... It says D-Major on there.<eos> Is there some kind of mistake?<eos> You see it says D-Major?<eos> That's me.<eos> Do me a favor and call Jamal.<eos> Hey, man, come on.<eos> You don't want to be doing this.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> You don't know what I want to be doing.
I made a mistake.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> In an Empire venue.<eos> On company property.<eos> Do you have any idea, the liability?<eos> - Ain't you supposed to be a father?<eos> - Calm down, people watching.<eos> You just mad 'cause Dad had my back on this.<eos> See, he understands me.<eos> Him and me got something you will never have, - and that's music.

So, I'm gonna have my people look at the terms of the contract, and if I like what I read, then you and I can do business. Sounds fair.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> Are you gonna let me out?<eos> Or should I climb over you?<eos> You had them high-society folks eating out of your hand.<eos> Even your mother.<eos> Yeah, well, especially my mother.<eos> All right.<eos> I need you to do me a favor. Ooh.
I told you I needed a little time to work my magic.<eos> I'm tired of your crap.<eos> Where's Rafael?<eos> Rafael was skimming from you, Gino.<eos> I got rid of the problem.<eos> Every dollar my husband skimmed.<eos> A gift from me to you.<eos> Another one of your magic tricks?<eos> Trying to get Rafi off the hook?<eos> Maybe you're the problem I need to get rid of.

You getting that ALS again?<eos> I have myasthenia gravis.<eos> You thinking about doing some business in Vegas?<eos> I hate Vegas, but we get this anonymous tip.<eos> You sure you don't know nothing about this?<eos> No.<eos> Cookie, I did not snitch on you.<eos> But there's one thing Tariq will take if you let him: me.<eos> I've been trying to get to Lucious Lyon a long time.<eos> And you can't touch him, but I can.
If you don't get this done... you could still be killed, and Tariq framed for the whole thing.<eos> Is he behind this?<eos> Just one of my thoughts.<eos> Boss, I got to prepare for the deposition. You cool for now?<eos> Well, Lucious, looks like it's, uh... just you and me.<eos> And since you're all sedated, this might be the perfect time to... take advantage of you.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't die, Lucious.<eos> Please don't die.<eos> Because if you die,
And what did your friend want in exchange for speeding up the process?<eos> Well, I'm not really sure, but we'll have to see, won't we?<eos> This ain't Lucious Lyon.<eos> You promised me Lucious Lyon, Giuliana. Relax, Gino.<eos> This is Andre Lyon,<eos> Lucious's son.<eos> He runs Empire.<eos> His father's just a figurehead.<eos> Andre, this is Gino Marcone.<eos> So you're the brains, huh? That's what they say.
Nice work. ♪ When you're not around ♪<eos> I knew I liked you.<eos> What is it?<eos> May I come in?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Look, this isn't about me or you. This is about Bella.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know that Lucious is wanting me to, uh, wear a wire with Tariq.<eos> Yeah, well, if you're looking for a way out, honey, you need to keep looking.<eos> No, I just wanted to say that... if something happens to me, if I go to jail or if I die, I want you to promise me that you're gonna look after my daughter.
Meeks and I are tied at the polls, so... it's out of my hands.<eos> Oh, please, you got this.<eos> Look, can you promise me that, uh, Lucious isn't gonna crash this party? 'Cause I can have it at the community center.<eos> You know that, right? Hey, now.<eos> Can we get a shot, Councilman?<eos> Look, tonight is not about him.<eos> This is your night.<eos> Cookie, over here.<eos> There you go.<eos> - I hope you're right.
Yes.<eos> Girl, we saw the teaser, When Cookie Met Lucious.<eos> It's lit.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.<eos> Never imagined I'd ever experience that feeling until I met Lucious.<eos> Uh, that's great. I'm glad you liked it.<eos> We got to go.<eos> We can't wait for the album to drop.<eos> Low-key, we pulling for you and Lucious to get
Hakeem, please let Miss Marshall...<eos> Can I call you Kennedy?<eos> Let Kennedy answer the questions.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's shelf the liquor talk. I mean, who keeps count when you're having a good time?<eos> Speaking of which, this is a photograph from your friend April's, uh, Instagram account.<eos> Do you recognize it?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> No, but your friend posts a photo of you embracing the alleged assailant.<eos> And you acknowledge that it's, uh, time stamped one hour before the alleged attack?
I don't see what this has to do with anything.<eos> I-I know you don't. It's all right.<eos> But, uh, why were you kicked out?<eos> - I got into an argument. - An argument?<eos> A little confused.<eos> The police report said,<eos> "A violent altercation with an employee with whom you once had a prior sexual encounter." Is that right?<eos> - Is that a booty call, huh?<eos> - He hit me.<eos> Hakeem, you saw it.

I'm confused here.<eos> Is my client now a character witness?<eos> The fact of the matter is you have a history of this.
And now Angelo is butt-hurt.<eos> Yeah, well, I mean, they all get butt-hurt.<eos> Ma, he gonna be all right.<eos> Here.<eos> The people are getting the wrong message, boy.<eos> They think everything was coming up roses between me and Lucious, and that's a lie, so I think we should release another teaser showing how much of a snake your daddy is.<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> - Tell 'em the truth.<eos> No, Ma. That's the point of a teaser is to, is to tease.<eos> Look, if you and Angelo are really strong, he shouldn't be worried about Lucious or Coocious or Tom, Dick or Harry.
Good, and he better act right, too. - 'Cause I voted for him. - Mm.<eos> Ma, I told Thirsty to fall back, and he wouldn't.<eos> Now, I think Kennedy gonna wig out on us.<eos> - Calm down. What's wrong?<eos> - Why are your panties in a bunch?<eos> Didn't she drop the case?<eos> No, 'cause Thirsty went hard at her, and she kind of fell apart. You know what?<eos> I got to do what's right.<eos> What do you mean by victim blaming? What's that?<eos> It's what you do.
You remember your song "Can't Truss 'Em"?<eos> Or-or "The Clap Back," where you dragged Tiana for filth?<eos> You were consistently making music where you make it seem like-like it's the woman's fault; and your fans, they treat the women that way because they look up to you.<eos> It's not my fault how other people act.<eos> No, that's bull.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You remember that little homophobic rant that you threw against me right in my own damn house?<eos> You-you know how many threats I got after that?<eos> Bro, I didn't know.<eos> See, Hakeem, you think just because you're a father now of a daughter that you can't be a misogynistic pig.
Look, man, you on your way to being woke, all right?<eos> You also have an opportunity to change the message, make some music that means something.<eos> I can't.<eos> Andre shut down my XStream channel.<eos> Jamal has more followers on his channel.<eos> After he released his damn teaser from his album.<eos> So...<eos> But you ain't heard it from me.<eos> You're special.<eos> And I just want you to know.
Might be contagious.<eos> You're not gonna believe the money we're gonna make on this Vegas deal.<eos> We'll be able to get that penthouse I told you about. Mm.<eos> So there will be room for me, you and Giuliana?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you're confused?<eos> You told that woman we have an arrangement that we didn't discuss.<eos> Did we have to?<eos> This is how I do business, Nessa.<eos> It's how you and Rhonda did business, and I am not Rhonda.
This is a song that I wrote for that beautiful woman standing next to him, many, many years ago.<eos> ♪ You're so beautiful ♪<eos> May I have this dance?<eos> ♪ You're so beautiful ♪<eos> ♪ You got me watching you, like a camera do ♪<eos> ♪ I still wait for you ♪<eos> ♪ You got me... ♪<eos> You're always did it for me.<eos> ♪ You got me watching you... ♪<eos> You never stopped doing it for me.
Previously on Empire... It's the devil's chord.<eos> And she told me you didn't even want to use it.<eos> - Do you love Angelo?
And that's why I have to come clean about what happened.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You just went Cookie crazy.<eos> We are prepared to call the Democratic mayoral primary for Angelo Dubois.<eos> We'd like to know when you're gonna find the time to wear this wire.<eos> Get Tariq to fess up to all his illegal tactics.<eos> I've been working on an investment deal for Empire artists in Las Vegas.<eos> Why don't you play the song you wrote for me, Lucious.<eos> You tell me why I shouldn't kill you right where you're standing.<eos> I think you might be the only person that's ever played this old piano.
Just a 15-year-old demo that I never quite finished.<eos> "Crazy, Crazy 4 U"?<eos> I was a bit of a romantic then.<eos> Was it before or after you divorced me?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I mean, we both know that love and romance is all bull, right?<eos> Well, it's hot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But don't worry, I'm not gonna put it on Inferno, or nothing like that.<eos> I mean, you and Jamal got that corny sentimental corner locked up with that When Cookie Met Lucious.
Might as well spit the damn thing out.<eos> Well...<eos> Angelo... has been hinting that, uh, if he wins the primary, he would propose to me.<eos> And he won it.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you and him will have a much smoother ride than we did.<eos> So, you're not gonna try and burn it down if I say yes?<eos> Uh... whatever you and him got, it ain't nothing compared to what we had.<eos> I mean, y'all ain't torn up a room, let alone a whole damn building.<eos> But if he asks you and you do say yes, um... I'll fall back.
I'm proposing all of that, for all of us, to the gaming commissioner in a few days.<eos> That goes well, we will have broken into a town Dad's been too afraid to crack.<eos> I-It just seems weird.<eos> She didn't say anything else about Rafael?<eos> We could've had this conversation between the two of us, Lucious.<eos> And you never spoke to him?<eos> Not once? I already told you.<eos> No, Thirsty.<eos> Now, the only reason I'm not smacking you out of that "buy one, get one free" suit you got on right now is out of respect for Lucious.<eos> But you keep comin' at me like that.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?<eos> Yeah, we're in the middle of something right now. It's just that I'm in the studio with Tory, and you have to hear this.<eos> Listen, I mean, the only reason that I'm... not gonna read anything into you referring to this dude as in the past tense is 'cause I'm taking you on your word, Shine.<eos> Just do me a favor and find out what really happened with this dude, man.<eos> You got it.<eos> Thank you, boss.<eos> ♪ And if you're waiting for me to stop ♪<eos> ♪ You gon' be stickin' to the clock like glue ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause I'm the kind of girl that wants the spotlight ♪<eos> ♪ And the big dreams, you do it, I can do it better ♪
- You hear your mommy?<eos> - It's going down.<eos> What magic?<eos> You know, the, um... solving the cases and stuff.<eos> You seem a bit nervous.<eos> Are you scared of Lucious, or are you scared of me?<eos> No, Tariq.<eos> No, it's just, um...<eos> I'm just wondering if maybe we might be making a mistake.<eos> Now, it's only a mistake if you try to play a brother.
You can't work on a case while you're suspended.<eos> I mean, Thirsty can get him thrown out of the FBI and thrown in jail.<eos> Anika stepped up for us.<eos> - I got to give her props for that.<eos> And she gave us Bella.<eos> Oh, take her. That's Angelo.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come to Granddaddy.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, how come I'm at your apartment right now, and you are not?
Well, be-because it's important.<eos> - Tell me now.<eos> - Cookie, face to face.<eos> That's how important news is delivered.<eos> Okay, you ain't got to get all gangsta on me.<eos> I'll come right now.<eos> Well, apparently Angelo has something he has to tell me now.<eos> I-I have to go.<eos> Sounds like he's about to propose to you.<eos> You think so?
Well, apparently Angelo has something he has to tell me now.<eos> I-I have to go.<eos> Sounds like he's about to propose to you.<eos> You think so?<eos> Probably, so you might want to get over there before he change his mind.<eos> Now that, um,<eos> Anika's stepped up to the plate, you gonna make her family again?<eos> She was never family.<eos> We're just kind of freaky together, you know?<eos> That should work out fine for you, 'cause you ain't nothing but a freak.
It's pretty much all we got, and ain't none of it exactly clean.<eos> Get the cash.<eos> Uh, just give me... just give me my girl.<eos> Your girl?<eos> That's my wife.<eos> You have any idea what I had to do to get that money?<eos> How many bridges I burned?<eos> How many of my friends I hurt?<eos> Yes, I lied to you, yes, I stole from you.<eos> But you have no idea what I've been through.

You're not supposed to be around it.<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> Come on, man, aren't you gonna give me props?<eos> - Finally found my voice.<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> No doubt, I'll give you props for that, but not for putting yourself in danger.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So it's perfectly fine for Jamal Lyon to courageously kick his pill habit and have his major comeback, but not for Tory Ash, right?<eos> Keep on talking out your ass, Tory.<eos> See, you're problem is - you just can't handle any competition.
Oh, boy. There you have it, folks.<eos> Angelo Dubois just got engaged to Cookie Lyon right here on The Grant Kelly Show.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Soon to be Mayor.<eos> Thank you, sir, I appreciate it.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> You do understand that Nessa can't screw this up.<eos> She's not gonna screw this up.<eos> Nessa's gonna be one of Empire's biggest stars.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> I don't think you understand.
I mean, Birdman and Snoop is already filed in as investors.<eos> So we've got a ton of other people on there.<eos> Giuliana.<eos> Lucious. Well, this is Charlotte Frost, as you know, the head of the gaming commission.<eos> Say hello.<eos> How are you, Giuliana?<eos> I'm wonderful.<eos> And you? - I'm good.<eos> - Andre.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
Previously on Empire...<eos> You got to protect - this angel with your life.<eos> - I will.<eos> You on your way to being woke.<eos> Make some music that means something.<eos> This is the head of the gaming commission,<eos> Charlotte Frost.<eos> I did not expect this.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
I still have feelings for him.<eos> I compromised the integrity of my campaign.<eos> For you!<eos> They messed with the wrong clan.<eos> They're going down.<eos> Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> DJ. DJ, baby, right now, you're riding this like it's a rainbow.<eos> You got to ride these quarters like you're the space shuttle trying to break through the Earth's atmosphere.<eos> ♪ I'm-a hold it down, I promise on me ♪<eos> ♪ But you can take a seat watching my glory ♪
They don't really respect us.<eos> They afraid of us.<eos> And then that thing that happened in 1996.<eos> And on top of it all, they're racist.<eos> Yeah, but Inferno's gonna change all of that.<eos> I've already laid the groundwork with the Nevada Gaming Commission, Snoop, we're good.<eos> Look. You know, be 100 with a brother, man.<eos> What's up, dude?<eos> All right, let me keep it real with you, yo.<eos> Now, you said Inferno was gonna be for Empire what Chronic was for Death Row, right?
A to the men, man.<eos> I hear you Lucious, but where's Jamal at in this equation?<eos> I don't think it makes sense without him.<eos> Yeah, you know Dre?<eos> That was my dawg.<eos> And my dawg gonna stay my dawg.<eos> But The Chronic wouldn't have been The Chronic if I wasn't on it.<eos> Now, you put it out there that Inferno was gonna have Empire's biggest artists.<eos> So to me, Jamal has to be a part of it.<eos> All due respect, baby, you were crucial to The Chronic.
I'm-I'm sorry. Mr. Almost Mayor.<eos> You should really work on your game.<eos> This is pathetic.<eos> Drinks on me.<eos> Give them a round.<eos> There go your fire, Frank.<eos> What's this, man?<eos> They're comin' at us.<eos> Wait a minute, let me get this straight.<eos> Your boy, Angelo, can walk up inside of my club, puffing his damn chest out, and you want me to give his ass a free pass?
I-I got to go.<eos> And, um, I guess we gon' handle this, um, Angelo stuff another time.<eos> Somebody's not happy.<eos> Always trying to hold me back, saying I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> Acting like somebody gave you instructions on how to be a father.<eos> All I wanted to do was just be a father to my daughter.<eos> My daughter.<eos> Should I kidnap her?<eos> - Yeah. - Uh-huh.<eos> Bae, I feel like you ain't listening right now.
It's just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I'm sick of you.<eos> - Sick of what, Ma?<eos> Look, I tried.<eos> All right?<eos> She's amazing.<eos> Um, let me tell you about that word, "try."<eos> But, Ma, you need to...<eos> It's an excuse 'cause you wearing my nerve out right...
Oh, Jamal's album.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can hold a fundraiser and we can tie it to the public's... When Cookie met Lucious all those years ago, you set a chain of events into motion that would one day destroy generations of hard work, generations of preparation in my family.<eos> My family.<eos> No, I can fix this, but please, let me just try.<eos> You got to stop firing back at Lucious because he's gonna light you up.<eos> Don't put your hands on me!<eos> Get off of me, bitch!<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Cookie, sweetheart, you have not seen our firepower.
That's what we do.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - She came for me.<eos> I don't want to hear that.<eos> No, if they're going low now, though, then we can go high for once.<eos> Oh, isn't that cute, you learned something from Michelle Obama.<eos> Yes.<eos> I sure did, yeah.<eos> Y'all, I can make peace. Y'all just need to tell me that I can go and talk to them.<eos> Well, Andre, y-you, you've lived in their world.
If you can make peace with them, make peace.<eos> I've got a casino to launch and an album to finish.<eos> Okay, y'all not understanding this. She has targets on all of...<eos> Wait, where is Hakeem?<eos> Ma, this woman ain't gonna kill nobody.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I know.<eos> Hakeem is fine. He's at home, I talked to him.<eos> You need to chill.<eos> No, you need to worry about who you trusting'.
But, look, I got another option. Now, I got this snake-skin sweater.<eos> Now, if I wear this, I got to wear the matching pumps.<eos> Now, listen, I told y'all the party was turned up all the way to Nyack.<eos> And this city boy is about that city life. But unfortunately, you know, sometimes I like to go my own way.<eos> I'm looking at every day.<eos> Shout out to Daddy. But I 100% understand wanting to step outside your comfort zone.<eos> You know?<eos> Testing your limits?<eos> Like I'm testing my limits having an all-girl party.<eos> And you specially invited, baby.
This is family.<eos> The lions have successfully safeguarded their pride.<eos> All right, you put your shoulders back, look him in the eye, and you'll be okay.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> All right, Jamal, I have nothing to say to you.<eos> Look here, I just want to apologize on behalf of my family.<eos> Well, apologies are just words, so, I'm sorry, that's too little too late.<eos> Angelo, look, man, I'm-I'm sad and disappointed just like you are.<eos> I wanted this for my mom so bad.<eos> But you got through to her.
What about him?<eos> He's been live-streaming from his apartment all day, saying he found the meaning to life. Is he all right?<eos> Says he saw a sign.<eos> He was watching TV, saw some lions.<eos> Like, real lions from Africa.<eos> And it was gonna make him a better father to Bella.<eos> He's on right now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's really sweet, actually.<eos> Makes me know that even if you and mom are lost ones, my brother? He will come to the light.
Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We've been down this path before, and y'all can clown me all you want, but it's real.<eos> Dad, you could make a conscious effort to be a better man, to lead your family the right way.<eos> Mom, we could put the past in the past and just make good music.<eos> Look, in view of the... kismet, fortuitous, whatever you want to call it that just happened I'm down.<eos> All right, Dad.<eos> You know you're shaking hands with the devil.<eos> I believe him.<eos> You know you do, too.
Mama...<eos> What?<eos> Will you be nice, please?<eos> If you read on, um, it's a $25 million settlement agreement. That is, of course, if you're not planning on contesting it.<eos> That's more than you ever offered me.<eos> I gave you half of my company.<eos> No, I worked my ass off for my half.<eos> Well, I'm sorry if that's not enough for your greedy little ass.<eos> I got something for your... Ooh.<eos> I understand that you and Lucious are working on a song together, Jamal.
Previously on Empire...<eos> Andre... promise me that you'll destroy that bitch that killed our baby.<eos> Laviticus Las Vegas is not like any other club.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
- Boom.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - It's fire.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about! - It is. I knew you was gonna love it.<eos> - You know what I was thinking, though?<eos> - Hmm? Why are we doing the same song on two separate albums?<eos> It's kind of superfluous, right?<eos> You know, so I think I want to remix mine.<eos> Nah, man, I don't know about you remixing the song.
No, no, no, you're just saying that because, what?<eos> It's too hard?<eos> But you see that young man in there, bleeding?<eos> He's doing that 'cause that's what it takes.<eos> He's got heart, man.<eos> He got shot four times and where is he?<eos> He's right in the studio.<eos> You got shot once. What did you do? You disappeared.<eos> No, no, Mal, I'm not even saying this as any kind of a diss.<eos> What I'm saying is I understand this music in a way that you don't get yet.
He killed it.<eos> ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪<eos> I don't know if, um...<eos> Andre.<eos> I-I thought you were Lucious.<eos> We have unfinished business.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> About the murder of my child.<eos> Rhonda told me you pushed her down the stairs.
I'll tell you why.<eos> Deep down, in your soul, you are ashamed of how much you cater to that man, and you should be.<eos> You should be, Ma.<eos> Look, if we include Lucious on the deal, we keep him from going to war, stupid.<eos> You know your daddy.<eos> And we all get a piece of Vegas.<eos> I don't get a piece of Vegas.<eos> This new show's got nothing for me.<eos> Andre.<eos> I think you are forgetting that Lucious is not our biggest problem.
And you see how she weaseled her way all up in our family business.<eos> That skank is trying to steal all of it.<eos> I don't like Giuliana either, Ma, okay?<eos> - Andre...<eos> - No, what?<eos> You were still out of line for bringing Lucious in on this deal.<eos> What did you say, little girl?<eos> And Andre is grown, Cookie, you can't talk to him like he's a child.<eos> He's not.<eos> I'm-a need you to understand what I'm about to do, Andre.
Andre told me we're getting Bella back.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Mom, is she gonna be okay?<eos> - Yes, she's gonna be fine.<eos> We're gonna get her back.<eos> Okay?<eos> You know what?<eos> - You sure? - Yes. Just go wait in the car.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You telling me you and Shine are gonna do this?
It's her you've got to answer to.<eos> Oh, Cookie. They think that I did something to your... to your granddaughter.<eos> I didn't do anything to your granddaughter.<eos> I know, listen to Cookie.<eos> I don't believe you, so that's not gonna cut it.<eos> Cookie, no.<eos> Okay, look, when we broke up, I know... things got weird, but you have to understand<eos> - I would never do anything like this.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no. When we broke up, you and your bougie-ass mama decided to wage a war on my family, and it stops today.
Look, I promise you, we're gonna get Bella back.<eos> Okay.<eos> When Cookie Met Lucious is going to be on our stage in Vegas.<eos> I already talked to Marcone, he agreed, it's done.<eos> Cookie.<eos> Look, this is what the fans want, Lucious, me and you together.<eos> All this in-fighting we've been doing, that's how Bella slipped through the cracks. Come on. We need to come together, Lucious.<eos> I don't think that's going to happen.<eos> Lucious. It's a win-win for the family.<eos> You get the show in Vegas and Empire gets the casino.
Okay, so then what's your plan, Dre?<eos> Because I know you don't expect me to just sit and watch from the audience.<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> It's between me and my family.<eos> You and your family?<eos> That's right.<eos> I thought I was family.<eos> Your mother disrespected me.<eos> And I thought you were strong enough to take it.<eos> Tory Ash stole a song from me and you didn't do a damn thing about it.
That's it?<eos> Let's see.<eos> Come on, give me some.<eos> Lucky night.<eos> I'm betting it all on black, baby.<eos> - Don't matter what number.<eos> - You always bet on black.<eos> I told you not to do this.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> The gaming commissioner is right upstairs, and you're not gonna cost us our license.
Look, I've heard this pitch a million times.<eos> Yeah, but what you haven't heard is my new music.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Can I get you some coffee?<eos> No, I don't drink alcohol or coffee.<eos> I'm Mormon.<eos> Silly me. All this time, I thought you was Mexican.<eos> And I thought you were black, but I have no idea whether you're Muslim or Christian or anything else, because I don't make assumptions on your religion
- Wait a minute, what?<eos> - Why the hell, why would we do that?<eos> - Are you stupid?<eos> - Inferno's... Inferno's market awareness is through the roof.<eos> Two Empire releases at the same time<eos> - will cannibalize attention from both.<eos> - Man.<eos> - Excuse me, Byron.<eos> - No, man. Shut your dumb ass up.<eos> Dad, I agreed to do a song with you, now you're pulling my album?
And I'm asking you to use all of your expertise as an FBI agent... to find my grandchild.<eos> I will give you whatever you want.<eos> All right, the key to taking Giuliana down is her ledgers, which she keeps in a wall safe inside her office.<eos> There's only one way in and one way out.<eos> And me and Cookie are both banned.<eos> So we're going to sneak inside a casino and crack a safe?<eos> Look, I know it sounds a little Hollywood, but, Cookie has faith in you, and I believe in being prepared.<eos> Now, we're not talking about the whole casino; We're just talking about the VIP room, where high rollers do their thing.<eos> Now, there's a security guard blocking that door.<eos> Carol, you're gonna distract him by using whatever means necessary.

Me and my means... are good to go.<eos> Yes, honey.<eos> Okay, now, Candace, you and hubby will get Giuliana out that door by Kevin here posing as a high roller.
You got to think of this safe as a piggy bank on steroids.<eos> It's not that deep.<eos> So who's gonna crack that?<eos> I'm not a safecra...<eos> Look, I'm not gonna crack a safe.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I used to boost department stores a lot.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Can you back your ass up?<eos> You have the chill disposition we need, so you will crack the safe, Becky.
Trying to act like you a damsel in distress when I know you got nerves of steel.<eos> I'm telling you, I don't trust me.<eos> My God. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I got it.<eos> Carol?<eos> You got this, girl.<eos> Look, I know I give you flak a lot. But you made of steel, girl.
Damn.<eos> I mean...<eos> They must be proud of their mother.<eos> Well, I hope they're proud of me someday.<eos> Right now, they hate how hard I work and wonder why I can't be with them at home.<eos> Yeah, I understand that.<eos> Mine are grown, but they will always need their mama.<eos> Especially...<eos> Hakeem?<eos> Frankly, I'm a bit disturbed to see that you've left him at a time of need.
And I want y'all to get out on that stage, together, and do a-a APB shout-out.<eos> So people can look for Bella.<eos> In front of all those millions of people.<eos> That's a great idea, right?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a beautiful idea, - Ma, it really is. But listen.<eos> - I know it is. I made a decision, okay?<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> Am I interrupting something?<eos> You're always interrupting something.
Welcome to Vegas, baby!<eos> Hey, put my mama on the phone.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's Mr. Lyon.<eos> Dwight?<eos> How long do you plan on keeping me cooped up in here?<eos> You're gonna stay in there until you're no longer having this episode you're having.<eos> I'm not having an episode.<eos> I put steel in the skull of your enemy.<eos> You know what, I don't know what you're talking about, and I'm sure you don't either.
I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Just come to the show.<eos> Yeah, you do that.<eos> I'm only coming to see you perform, anyway.<eos> That's the only reason you should be coming.<eos> You think you could also get Hakeem to come, you know what I'm saying?<eos> He don't need to be by himself here and...<eos> I mean, we tried to convince him to be in the show, but...<eos> His head ain't been in the game since Bella went missing.<eos> Don't you worry about that, though, I will take care of him.
Okay, Hakeem, you guys have already completely<eos> - vandalized the DuBois...<eos> - I don't care!<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Let's go, people.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hello, dear.<eos> It's your soon-to-be ex-mother-in-law.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to come and get rid of your things, Boo Boo.

She's just worried about Jamal and his PTSD.<eos> If I can live through bipolar, he can live through this.<eos> When it's all said and done, we'll be positioned to take over the lease and start our own independent venture in Vegas.<eos> You tell Cookie about the final piece of the plan?<eos> Hell no.<eos> No matter what he does to her, she'll always be in love with him.<eos> You really hate him, huh?<eos> What'd he do to you?<eos> Everything.<eos> More than you could ever imagine.
But I haven't given up my search for her, son.<eos> Well, Grandma thinks you...<eos> No, no, don't even ever listen to anything that your grandmother says.<eos> She is out of her freakin' mind.<eos> Look, baby, I'm not gonna go to Vegas if you don't go, okay?<eos> I would never leave you alone.<eos> Well, what about Anika, Ma?<eos> Don't worry about Anika.<eos> Anika got her own mama, she's got her own daddy to look after her. - Yeah.<eos> - You worry about you.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Damn, you make me crazy. Every time I watch that video I made of us...<eos> You made a video?<eos> My favorite part's where you yank off my belt, moaning you can't wait to see if what they say about black men...<eos> Mmm. You're extorting me.<eos> That's a harsh word.<eos> I think I like gentle persuasion better.<eos> I bet Mitt's made up his mind by now.<eos> Hope you and your family enjoy the show.
That's a harsh word.<eos> I think I like gentle persuasion better.<eos> I bet Mitt's made up his mind by now.<eos> Hope you and your family enjoy the show.<eos> Good-bye, Mrs. Frost.<eos> ♪ If you feelin'... ♪ Good looking out, Pablo.<eos> I got you.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Cookie.<eos> You understand me when I say take care of my family, right?
Hey, man, I told you we could see them.<eos> They're so sweet. They're nice people.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I'm not gonna lie... that kind of stirred up my feelings.<eos> Did you see the way they were holding hands with each other and looking at each other? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Say to hell with it.<eos> Why don't we just take a page right out of Barry and-and Michelle's book?<eos> I want to see the world with you, Cook.<eos> I want to write a new page in our story, far away from the backbiting and the drama.<eos> You created that drama by pitting your sons against each other.
Those are my office keys.<eos> Thirsty is gonna have some papers drawn up for the board's approval, but it's all yours, Dre.<eos> - Mine?<eos> - Yes, baby.<eos> We should've done this a long time ago.<eos> Hakeem and-and Jamal are artists, with huge careers ahead of them and they need a strong company to stand behind them.<eos> And, baby, XStream,<eos> Empire XStream, that was all you.<eos> This Vegas deal was all you.<eos> You are the one to take Empire to the next level.

And when you're taking care of yourself, son, you're unstoppable.<eos> And I want y'all to make sure y'all give him the support<eos> - that he needs.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You deserve it, bro.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Y'all already know.<eos> The boss.<eos> Congrats, man.<eos> Look, your mother and I want you to know know how very proud we are to have you as our firstborn.
Give me the phone.<eos> Come on, give me the app.<eos> Shine, give me...<eos> Man, keep your promises.<eos> It's so funny.<eos> You always saying we from the same place.<eos> We ain't the same!<eos> There's a code.<eos> And the code says you can't bring it back when the bullet leaves the gun.<eos> You started this.
Feel a little left out over there.<eos> Scoot over.<eos> I said to come alone.<eos> These are my friends... My friends who don't listen very well.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm...<eos> We know who you are.<eos> Check outside to see if there are others.<eos> I only brought Sam and Dean.<eos> As far as you know.
So we've come to set things right.<eos> Akobel, please.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Just...<eos> You have no business here.<eos> Me?<eos> You were sent here to observe humanity, to watch and to learn.<eos> But instead, taking up with a filthy animal.<eos> Have you no shame?<eos> Who are you to lecture me about shame?
Come on. Come on.<eos> All my life, I dreamed about angels.<eos> I studied them.<eos> I made them my life's work, until finally I learned the spell to summon one...<eos> Ishim.<eos> When I first saw him, it was like looking into the face of the divine.<eos> I thought he was perfect.<eos> But he is a monster.<eos> Ishim, what have you done?<eos> What have you done?
I made them my life's work, until finally I learned the spell to summon one...<eos> Ishim.<eos> When I first saw him, it was like looking into the face of the divine.<eos> I thought he was perfect.<eos> But he is a monster.<eos> Ishim, what have you done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> I shared all of our secrets with you, taught you all of our ways for your precious studies.<eos> I... I loved you.<eos> You didn't love me.
But he is a monster.<eos> Ishim, what have you done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> I shared all of our secrets with you, taught you all of our ways for your precious studies.<eos> I... I loved you.<eos> You didn't love me.<eos> You were obsessed with me.<eos> That isn't love.<eos> I loved you.<eos> You threw me away for him. No.
It is if you're willing to pay the price of admission.<eos> Every time I use one of their spells, a piece of my soul burns away.<eos> And once it's gone...<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.<eos> You won't, care about anything anymore.<eos> You won't be human anymore.<eos> I used to dream about my daughter every night.<eos> Do you know what I dream about now?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You don't trust me. I understand.
Lily sunder's daughter, was she human?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> She did.<eos> Said you were pretty obsessed.<eos> Well, she's a liar.<eos> Why would she lie?<eos> She's human.<eos> It's kinda what they do.<eos> Well, if she's a liar, she's pretty good at it.<eos> You, on the other hand, kind of suck.
Or you hungry?<eos> I got a chocolate bar here somewhere.<eos> Don't tell my wife.<eos> So... You've had a day.<eos> Wanna tell me about it?<eos> Like, for example, why you went after the leader of the free world?<eos> Well, let me guess. You don't like cops.<eos> Hell, I get it.<eos> We can be real jackasses.<eos> But you're gonna talk to me, son.
We can be real jackasses.<eos> But you're gonna talk to me, son.<eos> You just are.<eos> Now that's not a threat.<eos> I don't believe in torture. Doesn't work.<eos> I've seen folks waterboarded, cut on. And they talk. Ooh, they do.<eos> But they never tell you what you need.<eos> You know what does work, though?<eos> Nothing.<eos> See, when I leave, that door closes, and it stays closed, and you stay in the dark.
Let me paint you a picture of a world without monsters or demons or any of those little buggers that go bump in the night.<eos> Of a world where no one has to die because of the supernatural.<eos> Of a new world, a better world.<eos> Now if you work with us, you'll have support, in every sense of the word.<eos> You need lore?<eos> Our libraries are the biggest and the best.<eos> You want money? We have money.<eos> You need weapons?<eos> We have gear you can't even imagine.<eos> Now what I'm saying, Wally, is that you need people like us, and we need hunters like you.
Thank you.<eos> You ever hunt anything?<eos> I'm more tactical. Long-term strategy.<eos> Right.<eos> Listen, Mike...<eos> Mick.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I don't know you, and I ain't looking to take any orders from anyone.<eos> Especially some... Limey paper pusher.<eos> I'm not quite sure you understand, mate.
Chow time!<eos> Chow time!<eos> Chow time!<eos> Chow time!<eos> Chow time!<eos> Chow time!<eos> Can't help you.<eos> Come on, crowley.<eos> The police took them.<eos> You have people in the government.
I don't think so.<eos> All right, our... our case?<eos> The dead guy, throat stuffed full of money.<eos> Any of this ring a bell? Right, yes.<eos> Right.<eos> Um... the accountant.<eos> Barry Gilman.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> And you think he got his ticket punched by a demon.
Right.<eos> And you think he got his ticket punched by a demon.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, but when we went over to his place yesterday, we got a whole bunch of jack and a little bit of squat.<eos> There was no hex bags, no EMF, no sulfur, which means no case.<eos> Yeah, but if it's not a case, then what is it?<eos> I don't know. Death by money?<eos> You know, maybe the guy got whacked by, some mob dude with an ironic sense of humor.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go scope out the body.<eos> If you wanna spend some more alone time with, your waffles... All right. Have fun.
Well, I'm gonna go scope out the body.<eos> If you wanna spend some more alone time with, your waffles... All right. Have fun.<eos> Fine, hold up.<eos> Did you pay?<eos> Oops, no. Right.<eos> You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> And who are you?
All right.<eos> Well, well.<eos> You were saying about an ironic mobster?<eos> All right, so... a witch force feds old Barry here a hex bag and then casts a spell.<eos> Yeah, a spell that pumps him so full of cash, he dies choking on it.<eos> Witches.<eos> Well, I guess it's true what they say.<eos> Mo' money, mo' problems.<eos> Right?<eos> I hope you're still drunk.
Barry Gilman.<eos> Yes. And... we were here and we were, we were looking for leads.<eos> Yeah. Douche tax.<eos> Yeah, you did that yesterday, too.<eos> All right, come here. Check these out.<eos> Do these shake anything loose, these pictures?<eos> None of them.<eos> Okay, think hard.<eos> What happened next?<eos> I went to hit the lore. You went out for a burger. So...
No. It's...<eos> Wait.<eos> It's... it's her from, from the waffles.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Excuse me. Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you're gonna apologize, you better make it quick.<eos> Me apologize?<eos> You smacked me.<eos> - You were being a dick. We're even. - Even for what?
You wanna kill them, too?<eos> I want my family back.<eos> Is that a dead guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Never seen a dead guy before.<eos> Yeah, you have.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey!<eos> No, D-Dean, wait a second.<eos> Who are you?
A hundred years ago, the Loughlins came over from the Old World and turned a small town on the Mississippi Delta into their own personal fiefdom.<eos> Their children...<eos> Gideon, Boyd, and Catriona... Were like three rotten little peas in a pod.<eos> The family possessed a powerful spell book, a tome of Druidic magic called the Black Grimoire.<eos> Witches came from around the world to live with them and study its secrets... for a price.<eos> So what happened to 'em?<eos> Hunters happened.<eos> Of course, I'd heard rumors one or two survived, stealing away with their book, but I-I dismissed them as gossip.<eos> With Gideon dead, if you want to break the curse on your brother, we need to find that book.<eos> Wait a second. So you can't break it?
True.<eos> Also, it never hurts to have a Winchester owe you one.<eos> My name is Dean Wi...<eos> Winchester.<eos> My name... my name is...<eos> My...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.<eos> Of course, you'll need me there to help...<eos> No, no, you're staying here with Dean.
They'd sooner use your skin as an outfit.<eos> They can try.<eos> My... my...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stop touching everything.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> Play with this, and I'll tell you a story.<eos> Okay.<eos> Once, a beautiful witch was, again, run out of her homeland by those pompous, self-righteous, murderous hooligans. You know them as The British Men of Letters.
Once, a beautiful witch was, again, run out of her homeland by those pompous, self-righteous, murderous hooligans. You know them as The British Men of Letters.<eos> She sought refuge with a family of witches.<eos> All she wanted was a roof over her head and a safe place to hone her magic.<eos> Yet, they threw her out like... like common trash. Said she wasn't up to snuff.<eos> These witches sound like dicks.<eos> I think you got plenty of snuff.<eos> You can really remember nothing, can you?<eos> What a gift not to recall the things you've done.<eos> What have I done?<eos> You're a killer, Dean Winchester.
These witches sound like dicks.<eos> I think you got plenty of snuff.<eos> You can really remember nothing, can you?<eos> What a gift not to recall the things you've done.<eos> What have I done?<eos> You're a killer, Dean Winchester.<eos> Who's inside?<eos> Wait, I... I kill people?<eos> Scores.<eos> But... but... though you may be a stubborn pain in the arse with the manners of a Neanderthal and the dining habits of a toddler, everything you've done, you've done... for the greater good.
Witch.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is... is it done?<eos> Who's this hippie?<eos> Look at his face.<eos> Kind of like the time when I ate all your Halloween candy. You remember that?<eos> Classic.<eos> Not funny.<eos> I can't believe you called Rowena.

Who the hell are you? Arthur Ketch.
He had yellow eyes.<eos> Mom... what the hell did you get us into?<eos> That's him?<eos> That's the big bad demon you need help with?<eos> Just some old guy.<eos> Technically, I'm in my 60s.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Hell, what do I know?<eos> I've never gone after a demon before.<eos> I don't even know why you called me.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Doesn't appear to be warded.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Sam?<eos> Where's Dean?<eos> He's out stashing the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, Mom?<eos> I just wanted to make sure that, um... you're okay.
Sammy!<eos> You idiots!<eos> You're all going to die.<eos> You idiots!<eos> You're all going to die.<eos> Well, this day just keeps gettin' better.<eos> Crowley?<eos> You're him?<eos> The King of Hell?<eos> You must be Mother Winchester. Pleasure.
You're all going to die.<eos> Well, this day just keeps gettin' better.<eos> Crowley?<eos> You're him?<eos> The King of Hell?<eos> You must be Mother Winchester. Pleasure.<eos> I've heard so much.<eos> Touch me and I'll kill you.<eos> What's up with Feathers?<eos> What are you even doing here?
Just please... please, don't make my last moments be spent watching you die.<eos> Just run.<eos> Save yourselves.<eos> And I will hold Ramiel off as long as I can.<eos> Cass, no.<eos> Yes.<eos> You need to keep fighting.<eos> We are fighting.<eos> We're fighting for you, Cass.<eos> And like you said, you're family.
Everybody except yours truly.<eos> Rowena, now!<eos> I managed to pervert that spell.<eos> So your essence wasn't sent back to the cage, but instead, we found your discarded vessel a few years ago... repaired it, improved it, making it a fitting final home for the real you.<eos> What?<eos> No snarky, devilish comments?<eos> You have nothing to say?<eos> Thanks?<eos> I mean, all that effort.<eos> So you could've had me back in the cage, but no, you needed your sad, little revenge.
Sunk in a storm in 1723.<eos> I know something about something, about this ship.<eos> Um, it was, headed to the New World.<eos> Weighed anchor in Leith, Scotland.<eos> Leith. Yes.<eos> Ga n MacLeod.<eos> This was his ship. Crowley's kid?<eos> Yep.<eos> Sorry, it's just that...<eos> Y-you... you actually... you seriously think this is gonna work?
Its heart.<eos> Its power.<eos> Sort of makes me proud.<eos> A chip off the old ball of heavenly light, if you know what I mean.<eos> Phone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Need a favor.<eos> You... need...<eos> You?<eos> Turns out that behind that whole moron facade, you and your brother are, in fact, morons!
Turns out that behind that whole moron facade, you and your brother are, in fact, morons!<eos> You let Lucifer's love child live.<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> I don't owe you an explanation.<eos> Okay, so I'm... I'm guessing this isn't the best time to ask you to get in touch with Gavin so we can talk to him?<eos> Are you out of your minds?<eos> You know what, Crowley?<eos> When you set Gavin free to live in our time and possibly screw up the rest of human history, we didn't hunt him down, okay?<eos> So I think you owe us.<eos> You and Bullwinkle fix this mess before it hatches. Then, maybe then, we'll talk about my son.
No.<eos> Come with me if you wanna live.<eos> I get it. You're freaked.<eos> But take a breath.<eos> Chill.<eos> Y-you made those people explode.<eos> Again, not people. And they were attacking you.<eos> And you said you were a demon.<eos> Titles, labels.<eos> I'm a demon, you're Rosemary, complete with baby.
That's my ship!<eos> Well, it should've been.<eos> Yeah, we know all about her.<eos> We figured there's someone you'd wanna meet.<eos> Hello, Gavin.<eos> You look just like my father when he was young.<eos> Gavin, meet Rowena, your grandmother.<eos> My grandmother?<eos> She cannae be alive.<eos> Well, technically, dude, neither can you.
Nothing comes before my family, not with me.<eos> Really?<eos> Or is that just what you want to believe?<eos> You're different when you talk to them.<eos> Softer.<eos> Weaker.<eos> Not an insult, just an observation.<eos> But when you hunt, Mary... you're one of the best I've ever seen.<eos> Now you might play at being the good mummy, but when you're in the thick of it, nothing but a blade in your hand and blood in the air, that's the real you, the best you.<eos> And I think you know it.
I must speak with you.<eos> Fiona.<eos> Gavin.<eos> You abandoned me.<eos> You...<eos> Where were you?<eos> I came to your room. I...<eos> It wisnae my fault.<eos> I was sent somewhere else.<eos> I hid myself aboard The Star, and you wernnae there to protect me.
That's the face.<eos> Mom, we have our own tool kit, and it works just fine.<eos> A-and for obvious reasons, like broken ribs and burnt feet... We don't trust the Brits.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> Same as always.<eos> Family.<eos> Just hear me out. Please.<eos> What you did... A low, even for you.<eos> Wasn't right.<eos> And you would know what's right?
Our whole lives, you've been gone.<eos> You said that you needed time.<eos> No, you said you need space.<eos> So we gave you your space.<eos> But you didn't need just space. No, you needed space from us.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Dean, I'm trying...<eos> How 'bout for once, you just try to be a mom?<eos> I am your mother, but I am not "just a mom."<eos> And you are not a child.
For once, why don't you pick a side?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> Sam... I messed up.<eos> I know I messed up.<eos> But what the British Men of Letters are doing, this is bigger than us, Sam.<eos> We've got a real shot here.<eos> Shot at what?<eos> A world without monsters.<eos> A world where you and Dean don't have to hunt, where you can have normal lives.

Wow.<eos> Believe it or not, this is just their temporary base.<eos> The Brits talk like they're roughing it.<eos> You didn't tell me your son was stopping by.<eos> Didn't know I had to.<eos> Anyway, welcome.<eos> Yeah, um, you know, I really dig the whole low-budget Mission Impossible vibe, but I'm gonna head back.<eos> You're just in time for the briefing.<eos> Mick.<eos> I mean, that is, if you wanna hear how we're gonna exterminate every last vampire in America.
Should we wait?<eos> No.<eos> What'd, you forget your key?<eos> Hello, mate.<eos> How'd you find us?<eos> Well, this is a Men of Letters bunker.<eos> The location's no secret to us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, good talk.<eos> And whilst I understand that you're not feeling... warmly disposed to me, I wonder, what's your disposition to this incredibly rare, unspeakably expensive, bottle of barrel proof Scotch?
You know, Claire, you go down this path, our path, it's not a long life.
Stop hounding mom about buying us a car, all right?<eos> She's doing the best she can.<eos> Two more years, I am so gone.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're called animals.<eos> Let's just go back into town.<eos> No, Hayden, we're going.<eos> Have you, like, never seen a horror movie?
Mick, what's the deal with the bat signal?<eos> There was an incident in Wisconsin.<eos> "Animal attack."<eos> A girl named Hayden foster's in the hospital, and her brother lost his heart.<eos> Looks like a werewolf.<eos> Well, they don't usually leave behind survivors.<eos> Freak probably got spooked before it could finish the job.<eos> Well, perhaps.<eos> But it usually takes more than a fright to put your average werewolf off his supper.<eos> Oh, you'd know that, would you?
You put on a flannel, you pick up a gun, you go out there.<eos> Either you get good fast or you get dead faster.<eos> We're working with these people now and... and we're getting wins.<eos> We're saving people.<eos> The better they are, the better we are.<eos> Look, Mick held his own with the Alpha. Why not give him a shot?<eos> Maybe he'll come in handy.<eos> And what if he gets himself killed?<eos> I heard that.<eos> If he's coming, you're babysitting him.
She started coming in a few weeks ago after Conner got hired.<eos> Conner?<eos> Yeah, the other bartender.<eos> They're having a thing.<eos> What kind of a thing?<eos> Ask him.<eos> Hi, Conner.<eos> Nice ink.<eos> So you like high school girls, do you? Hmm?<eos> You get older, they stay the same age. Is that it?
But that's it. I swear.<eos> And the night she got attacked, did you let her in that night, too?<eos> Look, I don't know what happened.<eos> I was behind the bar the whole night.<eos> I didn't even see her leave. Hmm.<eos> And then what'd you do?<eos> Guess I went home.<eos> You guess?<eos> Well, it's a simple question, Conner.<eos> I ask what you were doing, then you tell me.

What are you, her dad?<eos> Dude, come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You ever touch her again, I'll break your face.<eos> Nice work in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, that alibi I almost bought it. Sorry?<eos> See, here's the thing about 16-year-old girls, especially 16-year-old freshly minted werewolf girls...<eos> They don't just die.<eos> And you've been acting sketchy all day.

Funny.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> BFF found.<eos> Beans spilled.<eos> Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.<eos> Texting constantly, ultra possessive.<eos> Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.<eos> Guess that explains why he was there.<eos> I did good, right?<eos> Claire, why does Jody think you're in Madison looking at colleges?
Hey, listen to me.<eos> Look, nobody said this was gonna be easy, okay?<eos> But you can live with this.<eos> No way. Hey. Look, so you... you have to stay locked up a few nights out of the month, okay?<eos> The rest of the time, you're you.<eos> Unless I break out.<eos> Maybe some people can control this, but I can barely keep it together on a good day.<eos> So if there's any chance I could hurt Jody or Alex... Or anyone...<eos> Claire, there may be another way.<eos> There's... there's the blood therapy that you talk about.
We need blood, live blood, from the werewolf that bit her.<eos> Good. Great.<eos> Who we lookin' at?<eos> Tribal tat. Back at the bar.<eos> We shook him down about Claire, and right after, she gets bit. That's not a coincidence.<eos> Timeline fits, connection to both victims.<eos> Then we should go.<eos> The full moon rises in less than an hour. And if she turns and feeds, our cheery success rate drops to zero.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You stay with her.
You'll kill me.<eos> Like I said, smart.<eos> Sam, if you're not back...<eos> We'll be back.<eos> Yo.<eos> All right, don't move, don't move.<eos> He's human.<eos> Let's give it time.<eos> It burns!<eos> You don't understand.
We'll be back.<eos> Yo.<eos> All right, don't move, don't move.<eos> He's human.<eos> Let's give it time.<eos> It burns!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's happening!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> No. Then you do it, please!
So we're good?<eos> Not quite, but we'll give you a second chance.<eos> Just don't mess it up. There won't be a third.<eos> Okay.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Honestly? I'm sort of craving a milk-bone right now.<eos> Look, um... What I said before... You guys are here when I need you and that's all that matters.<eos> You gonna tell Jody what happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, whatever you decide, we got your back.
Dad loved this thing.<eos> Dude, on the... on the...<eos> No, don't, don't, don't, don't!<eos> Don't s...<eos> What?<eos> Dean, you're covered in ghoul, man, and... and... and wraith. You... you have a piece of siren in your hair.<eos> Gross.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dude, why don't you take a shower and change your clothes? You've been wearing the same pair of boxers for four days.<eos> Okay, one, weird that you know how much underwear I packed.
You understand.<eos> I do. But you, in...<eos> In those chains? I mean, forgive me if I'm not quaking in my Testonis.<eos> I think both you and I understand that this? It's just a temporary situation.<eos> Do we?<eos> See, I understand that whatever sad little scheme that you're brewing up, I'm already 10 steps ahead.<eos> And I thought pride was my sin.<eos> It's not pride.<eos> It's fact. You cross me, I crush you.<eos> You hit me, I hit you back twice as hard.
Moving on.<eos> Me either.<eos> Moving on to case 42.<eos> This is a good one.<eos> It's on tort reform.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> All right, Peaches, I get that you're still upset about the whole...<eos> Upset?<eos> No, I'm totally over how you and your little band of misfits sent my son back in time...
And a lot of us really don't like Crowley.<eos> He's very prancy.<eos> So we released your hound to create a distraction, to see what he was hiding.<eos> We... We hoped...<eos> We knew it could only be you.<eos> And we brought this.<eos> But... but...<eos> Before we, let you out, we have a few... well, I wouldn't call them demands, exactly.<eos> But...<eos> So hellhounds are invisible to humans... unless you sold your soul, and they're after you.
We knew it could only be you.<eos> And we brought this.<eos> But... but...<eos> Before we, let you out, we have a few... well, I wouldn't call them demands, exactly.<eos> But...<eos> So hellhounds are invisible to humans... unless you sold your soul, and they're after you.<eos> Or, you're wearing a pair of these.<eos> They're glasses treated with holy fire.<eos> All right, Crowley and I are gonna hit the woods, see if we can't track down Cujo.<eos> You stick with Sam.
Come on.<eos> So how are things in Heaven?<eos> Functional.<eos> You know, there's the usual infighting, but... let's just say Lucifer having a baby on board has brought us all together.<eos> You know, this is an all hands on deck situation, Castiel.<eos> Including yours.<eos> Okay, so you're here for my hands?<eos> We want you.<eos> Look, you got more field experience than the next thousand angels combined.<eos> I think you overestimate me.
But it's not home, is it?<eos> I don't believe I'm welcome in Heaven.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> They still hold a lot of grudges up there.<eos> But what if I told you, you could come back?<eos> That all your sins could be forgotten?<eos> Forgiven?<eos> I would say that you're lying.<eos> But I'm not.<eos> You help us track down Kelly Kline, and you will be welcomed back into the fold.

And you have the power to do that.
But like I said, all hands on deck situation.<eos> Imagine it, Castiel...<eos> Free to come and go as you please, part of your family, your true family, again.<eos> Look... the Gardener's got a plan.<eos> All we ask is that you hear us, hear him out.<eos> For the greater good.<eos> All right.<eos> And lastly... You will grant me a thousand souls per year, and you will anoint me... the new King of the Crossroads.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, Tommy, you want anything, man?
Really bring out your eyes.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I mean it, Crowley.<eos> I mean it, Crowley.<eos> Go to Hell.<eos> Go to Hell.<eos> Really, Dean, all these years, you're so predictable.<eos> Yeah, well, I guess we've all changed.<eos> I got predictable. You got soft.
Thank you.<eos> He seems nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's get in.<eos> Hopefully, it still runs.<eos> Now what was that you were saying about always being two steps ahead?<eos> Buh-bye, Crowley.<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> What the...<eos> I'm glad you had a little taste of freedom.

Aah! Aah!
And you let her live?<eos> Look, it's not Kelly's fault, okay?<eos> She didn't know Lucifer was her boyfriend.<eos> Sure, yeah. It could happen to anyone.<eos> Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy.<eos> And I guess she changed her mind.<eos> Even with everything Kelly knew, it... It was still her kid. She couldn't.<eos> Then you should have!<eos> You should've shot her between the eyes immediately. Why?<eos> 'Cause that's what you would've done?
You said that you would help me.<eos> I wanna see a doctor.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until I know my baby's safe.<eos> You look like crap. Yeah, you look crappier.<eos> I gotta hand it to Mick.<eos> Man, you get him started, that guy can drink.<eos> I mean, we can drink, but he's got, like, the "can drink" gold medal.<eos> Hey, you talk to mom lately? Shouldn't worry about your mum.<eos> Her and ketch make quite the team.<eos> Would you want your mom working with him?
Yes.<eos> It's your game, your rules, so... I figure I can work with that.<eos> You win.<eos> What now...<eos> Sire?<eos> Quick update... the skels turned out to be shape-shifters.<eos> Killed a clan of seven. Eight.<eos> Eight, she says.<eos> I've learned not to argue.<eos> Um, you'll make with the typey typey, yes? I'll file the report.
Lower left, likewise.<eos> You made the right decision, you know.<eos> 'Cause when the dust settles, there's only gonna be one of us standing... And it ain't gonna be the guy with the accent, if you know what I mean.<eos> I'm very, very impressed.<eos> You'll be happy to know the... The vessel is completely sound. The repairs are secure.<eos> And the security system?<eos> Whatever it is that lets crowley turn me into his own personal sock puppet.<eos> I don't hear words.<eos> The... the s-system is very much I-intact.<eos> But you can disarm it?
Yeah, no, it's cool.<eos> Medicinal purposes, right?<eos> Yes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We just, wanted to talk about the night jarrod Hayes went missing.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, the sheriff says you were with him.<eos> Yeah, well, the sheriff is a jackass, all right?<eos> Look, he thinks jarrod just skipped town.<eos> You don't?
Moloch's been starved for 20 years. It's gonna take a few meals for him to get his mojo goin', but then... We are back, baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm savin' this town.<eos> Well, I'll tell that to jarrod and daryn.<eos> Jarrod was a screwup. Well, sorry, bud, but once he talked, he had to go.<eos> And daryn?<eos> Loose ends, you know?<eos> Loose ends.<eos> Come on!<eos> My jackass half-brother was supposed to be the next meal, but you'll do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
You have to stop.<eos> Don't act like you care.<eos> I gave you the plant.<eos> Aw, because you knew it was failing.<eos> What a bunch of crap.<eos> That's what I get. I get that my whole life! The crap!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I'm saving this town.<eos> I'm the hero.<eos> And you're dead.
- Hello, brother.<eos> - Kelvin.<eos> - You remember? - What are you doing here?<eos> Same reason as you.<eos> So what do you say we help each other out?<eos> You help us track down Kelly Kline, and you'll be welcomed back into the fold.<eos> And you have the power to do that? No.
You help us track down Kelly Kline, and you'll be welcomed back into the fold.<eos> And you have the power to do that? No.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm just the messenger.<eos> But Joshua can.<eos> All we ask is that you hear us.<eos> Come on, Cass.<eos> I've called you three times now.<eos> And you said you were a demon.<eos> I'm a demon. You're Rosemary, complete with baby.
Really, Kel?<eos> Not taking your pills, picking at your food... refusing to bathe?<eos> Stop disrespecting the God inside of you.<eos> He's gonna kill me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he's not gonna stop there.<eos> Every sad, weak human, every tight-ass angel, every sniveling demon... they'll all be consumed.<eos> So go ahead.<eos> Play your games.<eos> But whether you're healthy or sick, filthy or clean,
That's his excuse.<eos> Wow.<eos> I was in Heaven. I was working with the angels.<eos> When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly, I-I thought they could help.<eos> And?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, at least you're back.<eos> We're glad you're back.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, 'cause while you were striking out in Heaven, we had a shot at Dagon, and we lost.
He's not.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He's not.<eos> My baby's not evil.<eos> He saved me.<eos> That's what you think happened?<eos> He saved himself.<eos> He doesn't care about you.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> He's born, you die.
Dagon, the girl, they're in the house.<eos> Showtime.<eos> Andnowwe 'vegot 5 seconds to see more of the Super Catch Phrase and win the bank. Here we go.<eos> Cindy, for $350, tell us what it is.<eos> Pumpingiron?<eos> Not right.<eos> Chip and Cindy...<eos> Got a lot of people in the audience who think they know, but we have a Toss Up Catch Phrase for you.<eos> Now your opponent knows, but she can't guess.<eos> Only you are entitled.
Or lift it to its feet.<eos> This baby, nothing is born evil.<eos> I can't take that chance.<eos> None of us can.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Right.<eos> Suicide mission, no contingencies, blah, blah, blah.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You don't know where Castiel is.<eos> But he's an angel, you're an angel. Got a feeling, ya dig deep enough, you can make an excellent guess.
I used to believe in a plan.<eos> I used to believe that I had some mission.<eos> But I have been through enough now to know that everyone is just winging it.<eos> Some of us quite badly.<eos> Lucifer... he's just breaking toys.<eos> He's sowing destruction and chaos, and there is no grand purpose at work.<eos> And there's no special role for you.<eos> When Lucifer took over Rooney's body... I'm sorry. You were just there.<eos> I know my baby can be good for this world.<eos> Kelly, if he's born... that is not something you can survive.
Turn around.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Heaven.<eos> The... sandbox, if you tell me how to get there.<eos> Kelly, I can make you stop this car.<eos> Why haven't you?<eos> Okay, why are you doing this?<eos> Because he chose you, Castiel.<eos> When you put your hand on my stomach, I heard him. He spoke to me.<eos> He told me that even if it seems scary, if I just went to the gate, if I just followed your plan, that you would make sure he was born.
How did this happen? What?<eos> The lying? The Heaven plan? Or the fact that I'm working on this stupid truck?<eos> No, I mean, what's wrong with Cass?<eos> Well, he hasn't exactly had a banner year.<eos> I mean, think about it. Between Lucifer... killing Billie, Ramiel, everything's been blowing up in his face. And he's so desperate for a win right now, he can't even see straight.<eos> Go ahead and give it a try.<eos> This is it?<eos> This is it.<eos> Kelly, are you sure?<eos> As long as you're here, I know it's gonna be okay.
Go ahead and give it a try.<eos> This is it?<eos> This is it.<eos> Kelly, are you sure?<eos> As long as you're here, I know it's gonna be okay.<eos> Castiel.<eos> Kelly.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Hello, Joshua.<eos> I know you must be scared. But don't be.
You know, I gotta say, you did a bang up job with those two.<eos> You must be drunk.<eos> Off of wine?<eos> Not fair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did the best I could for Max and Alicia. No.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I see how you are with them, all right? It's good.<eos> You know, they're... They're happy.<eos> Alicia said you grew up in the life. Yeah.
Hello, Mary.<eos> Your handprint doesn't open this room because it's not for you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Why is Mick's body in a box?<eos> An unfortunate werewolf mishap.<eos> A werewolf shot him in the head?<eos> It's not impossible.<eos> You're a psychopath.<eos> Mary.<eos> Did you kill him?
What are you doing?<eos> Let her go!<eos> That's not your mom.<eos> What?<eos> Shh.<eos> What are you talking... mom!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Max, what is wrong, sweetie?<eos> I don't know what kind of thing you are, but you are not my mom.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, screw them, right?<eos> What do they think, after all these years...<eos> How are we doing today?<eos> Oh, Mary.<eos> Those eye bags again.<eos> Did something happen last night?<eos> Could you be more specific?<eos> Was I out of this building?<eos> Well, you would know that better than I. Unless you're having trouble distinguishing fact from fiction.
Everywhere. After you died, your beloved John was a man slowly going mad, searching for revenge.<eos> What? Your boys didn't tell you?<eos> The drunken rages?<eos> The weeks of abandonment?<eos> It's no wonder they're...<eos> So...<eos> Enough with the fairy tale. We are returning you to a more pure version of yourself...<eos> Mary Campbell, natural born killer.<eos> No.<eos> The American hunters haven't fallen into line as we'd hoped, so they're being eliminated, repealed and replaced by our people, and you, Mary, you play a key role in that.
How can you just...<eos> I'm not sure what you're expecting.<eos> That I'll intervene?<eos> We made it clear to each other, we don't have a relationship.<eos> We worked together.<eos> We...<eos> We know each other.<eos> I don't know you, Mary.<eos> Not really.<eos> You certainly don't know me.
So we've rejiggered the locks, we've shut off the water, and once we leave, the pumps that bring in the air shall reverse.<eos> Your oxygen should be gone in... Two days, maybe three.<eos> You dying in here, it's almost...<eos> Come along, Mary.<eos> No!<eos> He wants this done before he returns.<eos> What are we supposed to do with...<eos> Toss it.<eos> I do have to hand it to lady Bevell. Your treatment's been most successful so far.<eos> And so you know, this will become...
Hands were I can see 'em. Is that you, Roy?<eos> Which makes you Walt.
Yeah.<eos> Dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Wait, I got one.<eos> Garth? Hey.<eos> Man.<eos> It's good to hear your voice.<eos> Listen, those brits I told you about, they've got a hit out on American hunters.<eos> I'm guessing that goes double for werewolf hunters, so... No, I don't have time to explain.<eos> You and Bess need to get someplace safe. Okay?
I saw you.<eos> You're ready for this.<eos> You show those sons of bitches who's boss.<eos> What about you?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna save mom.<eos> Look, if she's in there, if our real mom is in there somewhere, then I'm gonna try and find her, bring her back.<eos> Okay, Donna's... waiting for me at a safe house.<eos> I should drive straight there, no stops.<eos> And you'll call me when this is all over.
For all of it.<eos> Everything.<eos> On the other side of this, we can start over, okay?<eos> You, me, Sam.<eos> We can get it right this time.<eos> But I need you to fight.<eos> Right now, I need you to fight.<eos> I need you...<eos> I need you to look at me, mom.<eos> I need you to really look at me and see me.
I'm trying to help you, ma'am.<eos> Are you, sven?<eos> Because if you ask me if I have the quarterinch Allen wrench one... one more time, I am going to come down there and burn your giant viking junkyard of a store to the ground!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> ! Are you sure it wasn't in the box?<eos> God!<eos> Kelly.<eos> I told you I'd put this together.<eos> I'm very good at following instructions.<eos> And you need to rest.
I love you so much.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hey, listen to this... Twoheaded calf was born in lava hot Springs, Idaho.<eos> That's weird.<eos> That is weird.<eos> Yeah, but not our kind of weird. Look, whatever this thing is gonna be, it... it's gonna be big and bad...<eos> You rang?<eos> Did you do it?<eos> Did you let Lucifer out?
Okay, two hours ago, there was a massive power outage in the pacific northwest.<eos> Sounds like the right kind of weird.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> They tracked the outage to an address in north cove, Washington, to a house currently being rented by one James novak.<eos> That's cass.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> It's about time.<eos> Think we're gonna trust you out there after what you pulled?<eos> You stay here, you sit down, and you shut up.
It's a tear in space and time.<eos> And that means?<eos> It's a doorway to another world.<eos> Anoth... what, like narnia?<eos> No. No, through there it's earth, but...<eos> It's a... It's an alternate reality.<eos> So it's a bizarro world?<eos> Or... or like the place we got zapped to where we were, actors on a TV show. Yeah.<eos> The supernatural wasn't real. Yeah.<eos> And you were Polish.
It has to.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Remember... paradise,.<eos> Well...<eos> This is a fun surprise.<eos> I gotta hand it to you guys.<eos> You never give up, even when you should.<eos> Even when it would be so stupid not to.<eos> Look, whatever you're planning on doing,
Yeah.<eos> Quite a few.<eos> And they'll all be starting to talk amongst themselves and speculating.<eos> Here you go.<eos> All right?<eos> Maggie, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Three weeks I've had to wait to get an appointment with you.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But I'm glad you're here now.
Do you understand?<eos> So I just need you to sign there, where it says "victim's name".<eos> Sorry about that, I don't know why they have that there. We don't use that word.<eos> We use the word "client".<eos> Thanks.<eos> Some information leaflets for you to take with you.<eos> We're gonna have regular meetings, so... have a think about how often you'd like.<eos> We can meet somewhere like this or I could come to your house.<eos> If there's developments in the investigation or you have questions for the police, I can help with those.<eos> Am I right thinking you haven't given your full interview yet?
You do what's right for you.<eos> Don't worry about what anyone else says.<eos> I can come with you to the interview, if that's helpful.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm here for whatever you need.<eos> I feel like I'm not in my own body.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Your mind and your body are not going to be behaving normally.<eos> You might be going through a process of trauma.

It'll be very brief and non-specific. It won't mention your name or the exact location.<eos> We wanted you to know, in case you saw it mentioned anywhere.<eos> Right.<eos> You have to do that, do you?<eos> Well, it's important for us to release limited information into the public domain, in case it encourages any witnesses to come forward.<eos> We'd also like you to come in at 4pm today for your ABE interview.<eos> Right. If that's what you want.<eos> You're welcome to have Beth accompany you, if it helps.<eos> We were still discussing the timing! No!<eos> You were discussing it, I'd made a decision.
Who supports the support workers?<eos> That's why I called you.<eos> Right.<eos> Beth, you're not being fair.<eos> You know, you...<eos> You can't just ask me to meet you for a coffee, like everything's still the same.<eos> - Can't I?<eos> - No.<eos> You know you can treat me like your little dog, give me a whistle and I'll come running.<eos> But I need you not to do that.

Letters?<eos> Petitions?<eos> March on the offices?<eos> Bless you, petal, but I've looked in the eyes of the corporate behemoth.<eos> I think it'd be a waste of breath.<eos> Just be glad you've got a job for life.<eos> People will always need a bit of God.<eos> I wish you were right.<eos> On Sundays now, the church is emptier than before Danny was killed.<eos> You don't come.
The, er, police, they came to see me.<eos> After the party invite list.<eos> The police came to see you and you didn't tell me?<eos> It wasn't my place to tell you.<eos> Anyway, I didn't know if we was allowed.<eos> Have you seen Trish?<eos> I'm not exactly going to be high on her list, am I?<eos> Do you know what happened?<eos> I haven't got a clue.<eos> I was hoping you might have.
Well, yeah, but I took it back.<eos> Everything's still on here.<eos> Mate, I'm really not that bothered.<eos> You haven't seen it.<eos> I have.<eos> Oh, it's good this place. We can have some lunch after.<eos> It's not a jolly, Miller.<eos> We've this guy, then the musician.<eos> We're behind already.<eos> God, do you live on air?
Mark!<eos> What?<eos> You're busy, are you?<eos> You got better things to do?<eos> Can we talk about this among ourselves first? As a family.<eos> What do you think I'm doing this for, Chlo?<eos> I'm doing this for us, as a family.<eos> Are you?<eos> Cos we don't want it, me and Mum.<eos> We're here telling you that and you don't seem to hear us.
Why only once?<eos> We didn't click.<eos> She's older, you know.<eos> At no point, after you dropped her off on Saturday night, did you see Trish Winterman again?<eos> Correct.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> S'pose this is where you tell me off for bringing in Ben, is it?<eos> What was that all about today?<eos> How many ways do I have to say it before you hear me?
I wasn't there for him.<eos> I should've been there for him.<eos> You scare me, Mark.<eos> I don't know how to reach you anymore.<eos> It's like... there's just you, and what you want and no-one else gets a look in.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Our son died.<eos> All his potential, everything he could've been, gone.<eos> But you still have a family.

More like Sunday morning. Past one.<eos> He sleeps on that.<eos> I have the bed.<eos> Well, that must be difficult when he's on late shifts.<eos> Not just when he's on late shifts. He sleeps there all the time.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He cheats. Ten years now he's been cheating.<eos> He thinks he's a good liar. But he's not.<eos> It's easy to find out. And they never last long.<eos> Does he know that you know?
Previously on Broadchurch...<eos> Trish Winterman received an anonymous threatening text message from a blocked number.<eos> Trish, could the text be from the man that you slept with on the morning you were attacked?<eos> I told you, I'm not talking about him.<eos> We are probably gonna retrieve his DNA from your bedsheets anyway.<eos> She's a woman dealing with trauma and you are pushing too hard - dial it back.<eos> 11 grand for our little boy's life?<eos> I don't want compensation. I want justice.<eos> We don't want it!<eos> We're telling you and you don't seem to hear.
To process a civil suit, we'd need Mr Miller's whereabouts.<eos> - We'd need an address for him.<eos> - There it is, then. We can't.<eos> No-one knows where he is anymore.<eos> That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you - can you delete it?<eos> Get me the computer, I'll get it removed.<eos> You have to remember, Trish - you have to do everything you can to help them catch him.<eos> We're all in danger if you don't.<eos> Are you sure about this, Trish?<eos> You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
Bit public.<eos> She's still...<eos> Let me get this out of the way.<eos> Come on, Leo.<eos> Keep your end up.<eos> Blue twine on the goals.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to check that boy's alibi.<eos> I've just received urgent oral authority from the superintendent for surveillance on our friend Aaron Mayford.<eos> You and Steve need to get down to his house till the surveillance team's organised.
Well, that wasn't on there.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> - No. Oh, shit, sorry.<eos> I didn't...<eos> I mean, it was my daughter who set me up.<eos> So she did all the swiping?<eos> No, I mean. I chose you based on...<eos> I mean, did I say that, uh... you look really nice?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - So do you.
When you say 'everywhere', do you mean 'the church'?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do sometimes allow me outside of the exclusion zone.<eos> Vicar with a sense of humour?<eos> You should advertise.<eos> What are you doing tomorrow?<eos> Uh, are you genuinely asking for a list of my appointments?<eos> No, but do you think you can move them?<eos> No. Why would I do that?<eos> I'm going on a little trip. I thought you should maybe come along too.
"What if it's the same man?"<eos> "I didn't report it, and he's done it to someone else."<eos> "I could've stopped it...<eos> if I'd been braver."<eos> "I know what she's going through and it's my fault."<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were very brave coming to see us today, Laura.<eos> I don't know how you've kept it to yourself for so long.<eos> You're doing the right thing now.<eos> I want you to know, it doesn't matter how long ago this was.
Yeah, their system was a right old mess.<eos> And was it Laura Benson in charge of their IT contract?<eos> No.<eos> It was a bloke.<eos> Terry somebody.<eos> You didn't have anything to do with Laura Benson?<eos> I've never met Laura Benson.<eos> Do you want the bacon in the fridge or the freezer?<eos> 'Cause there's quite a lot of it.<eos> You really didn't have to do all this.
Alright.<eos> How do you classify 'alright'?<eos> Uh, I think we have a good relationship.<eos> She seems to trust me.<eos> We're in regular contact.<eos> Is something bothering you about it?<eos> Nothing. It's all fine.<eos> No, something's not right.<eos> What is it?<eos> Beth, the point of these supervisions is that you're honest with me.
- Yeah, why?<eos> Well, it's just I'm in the process of figuring out where to live.<eos> So do you think I could rent one off you for a few weeks maybe, this weekend on?<eos> I thought you were living with what's-her-name.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Uh, no, that's not going so well at the moment.<eos> She's thrown you out.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, she's about to.<eos> Shit, you had everything - a good home, lovely wife.
Enough!<eos> Can I have a caravan or not?<eos> - That's all I want to know.<eos> - No. - Sorry?<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't trust you.<eos> Trish never trusted you.<eos> You don't treat people very well.<eos> In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you were the one that raped her.
And didn't know how helpful it'd be.<eos> You said it didn't have to be about that?<eos> It's just support.<eos> I did, I really talked to her about it.<eos> She's not up for seeing you. I'm sorry.<eos> Right.<eos> You say that like I've let you down. No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I am so admiring of you.<eos> It's brilliant, the way you've turned all of this into a way to help people. People really respond to you.
No, don't be an arsehole.<eos> What, you don't want me to tow it for you then?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Bad about your party, wasn't it?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> Can't really believe it, can you?<eos> What some people are capable of.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> It's all anyone's talking about, soon as they get in the cab. You're the only one who doesn't fancy her.
How'd you know it was her?<eos> Mate, it's all round the town.<eos> At least they kept her name out of the papers.<eos> Hard for you and your wife.<eos> Must've been someone you invited. - Must it?<eos> - Just by logic.<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> Well, I dropped some people there and back that night.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> So you were around the place, but you weren't invited.
I wanna make sure we've got everything straight.<eos> Before these reports of non-recent attacks, who were lining up as our key suspects for the attack on Trish Winterman?<eos> Right, so we've identified 65 men we know were present at the party.<eos> Through alibis and witness statements, we've ruled out 42.<eos> So we're left with people like, um,<eos> Ian Winterman - ex-husband, bad relationship.<eos> Jim Atwood - slept with her that morning, might've been worried his wife's gonna find out at the party?<eos> So he raped her?<eos> I don't think that automatically follows.<eos> I'm doing a list like you said. I'm not saying it's perfect.
Are you refusing to do what I just asked you?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> You are in so much shit when I get back here!<eos> So Cath Atwood asked you to beat up her husband?<eos> - No.<eos> - But she knew you were going to?<eos> No.<eos> DI Hardy, I need to talk to you urgently outside.<eos> Can you not see I'm in the middle of something?<eos> Yes, and do you not understand I might have something important?
- He was on your list!<eos> I checked with him at the start. He said he didn't know anything.<eos> God, Katie, do you know what you've done?<eos> You have to leave this office immediately.<eos> Do not touch anything, do not take anything, don't speak to anyone or contact anyone in any way.<eos> In fact, give me your mobile phone.<eos> Put that in a sealed evidence bag.<eos> - Sir, I promise...<eos> - Keep your mouth shut.<eos> We have a suspect in custody and you cannot be here.
Put that in a sealed evidence bag.<eos> - Sir, I promise...<eos> - Keep your mouth shut.<eos> We have a suspect in custody and you cannot be here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really?<eos> You understand how royally you might have screwed this investigation?<eos> Because if we find out that Trish's attacker has any connection to you, this will never stand up in court!<eos> And you will have to answer not only to me and the chief super, but to the women that he's attacked.
I understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really?<eos> You understand how royally you might have screwed this investigation?<eos> Because if we find out that Trish's attacker has any connection to you, this will never stand up in court!<eos> And you will have to answer not only to me and the chief super, but to the women that he's attacked.<eos> Get out now!<eos> What do you want us to do if it turns out Ed really did this?<eos> Ed Burnett has just admitted that he attacked Jim Atwood because he found out that Jim slept with Trish.<eos> So you put that with this evidence.
The more help you get, the better the outcome for you. I really believe that.<eos> I'm not changing my mind.<eos> I'm not talking to the police.<eos> All I want to know is what Ed told you and what you told him. Nothing!<eos> Honestly.<eos> I talked to him as soon as I knew he'd been at the party and he swore he had nothing to do with it.<eos> - And you thought that was fine? - It's not what you think.<eos> I've barely seen him in the last 12 years.<eos> We're not that close.<eos> He says he's not a rapist and you take him at face value and you omit to share that with anyone.
Mum's computer was there when we went to bed and it wasn't there this morning.<eos> What makes you think that was me?<eos> You're the only other person who has a key, and you asked me for her computer.<eos> Leah, seriously...<eos> Dad, please, please,<eos> I really need you not to behave weirdly right now.<eos> This is my spare locker key.<eos> If Mum's computer is in there at the end of the school day, I can take it home, put it back and don't have to tell anyone.<eos> Leah, I really don't know what you mean.<eos> Supposed to be you parenting me, not the other way around.
How are we gonna see Trish or Ian or... half this town now that everybody knows?<eos> Well, we can style it out.<eos> You actually think that's possible, don't you - style it out?<eos> Yeah, but what do you want, then, Cath?<eos> I want you to come up with a solution to all this shit that you have poured on us.<eos> Come on, it's not that bad.<eos> It is that bad!<eos> Do you think I don't know all the loans and the unpaid bills this shitty little garage is drowning under?<eos> Yeah, but it didn't stop you from demanding a birthday party that would've bankrupted a bloody sheikh.<eos> 'Cause I was waiting for you to come clean!
You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry. - With me?<eos> With the man who did this to you, but yeah, with you a little bit.<eos> I'm angry because we have to fight this!<eos> We cannot let men get away with doing these things to us.<eos> I don't want that responsibility.<eos> I know you don't, but tough luck, 'cause you've got it.<eos> You thought you were the only one he did this to, but you are not - you are far from alone.<eos> What'll happen to other women if you don't speak out?<eos> How do we stop this man if you pretend it never happened?
You ask me, everyone's been raped or abused.<eos> You know, one or the other.<eos> No-one is asking you, Dad.<eos> Am I not allowed to have an opinion?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh! - You understand about consent?<eos> - Oh, Mum, do we have to... Yeah, we do.<eos> It's important.<eos> I'm not having you thinking what Granddad's saying is acceptable.<eos> Whenever you're with a girl or a woman or whatever, you must ask and you must be certain that she has agreed to whatever it is you are doing together.
The future's not inevitable. It's down to you.<eos> I know I've not been very good at the whole dad thing, but I love you so much, Daise.<eos> And I've missed loads of you growing up.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - No, listen, come on.<eos> I missed so much of that, and I can't make up for missing that time, and I'll never forgive myself for it.<eos> But I'm learning, yeah?<eos> I'll make more time for you.<eos> I want to be a good dad.<eos> And I want you to know...

Beth called me yesterday.<eos> They tried to talk to the other woman who was attacked and she's not willing to disclose.<eos> But she did say she was attacked after her car broke down.<eos> She was walking home, as the breakdown service never turned up.<eos> - Which breakdown service?<eos> - They didn't ask, but we both know Jim Atwood runs a breakdown service.<eos> We're about to interview Ed Burnett.<eos> You're muddying the waters!<eos> We've struggled to find a link between the attack on Trish and the other two women, and maybe Jim is that link.<eos> Let me see what records he keeps for breakdown customers while you interview Ed.
OK, I'll be there in 30 minutes. If you're sure.<eos> If you're really sure.<eos> See you then.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> You all right?<eos> So what's it going to be, Alec?<eos> I'm gonna ask the custody sergeant to release you on bail.<eos> I'll ask for conditions to be put into place during your bail time, namely that you cannot contact Trish Winterman or members of her family, either directly or indirectly.<eos> And that you don't go round to her house or the house of any family members.<eos> People round here are anxious and you're playing into that.
I'm so tired, Beth.<eos> I can't see anything ahead.<eos> You know, it'd just be... easier if all this went away.<eos> Do you not think you could talk to us?<eos> To me?<eos> We did talk.<eos> We talked all the time.<eos> And it never helped.<eos> I... I wanted to do something.<eos> I'm so sorry you feel this way.

I picked her up, took her car back to the garage and then I drove her home.<eos> I dunno when this was, though.<eos> About a year back?<eos> June 2014.<eos> Where you going with this?<eos> You told me this was about Trish.<eos> We're just trying to get to the truth.<eos> Didn't like that, did he, Miller?<eos> Looked proper rattled.<eos> You seem much happier.
- Right.<eos> - I'm so angry with him.<eos> He has two daughters, one of whom is barely three years old.<eos> How could he do this to them?<eos> He knows what loss feels like, what it... what it rips out of you.<eos> You were right to go gentle on him.<eos> - He's hurting.<eos> - We're all hurting.<eos> I'm hurting.<eos> You're hurting.
Along with this receipt from a shop called Wessex Fuel. Showing that you bought those at 5:03pm on the Saturday of your wife's party.<eos> Directly on the route between your house and Axehampton House.<eos> Who were you hoping to use these on, Jim?<eos> Cos it certainly wasn't your wife, was it?<eos> See, the problem for you is these condoms match the brand of condom used by the man who raped Trish Winterman.<eos> And there are condoms missing from that packet.<eos> When did you use the condoms, Jim?<eos> Who did you use them with?<eos> Your wife also confirmed that she was away on those other two nights when women were attacked.<eos> So, unless you tell us otherwise, you don't have alibis for those nights.

I don't subscribe to your version of the world. But I worry about sending my daughter out into it, with men like you around.<eos> Did you ask Trish to have sex with you that night?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> She said no.<eos> How did you feel about that?<eos> Like I had a better option.<eos> Hello, this is Ed Burnett, please leave a message.<eos> Dad?<eos> You told them I was violent.<eos> Yeah, well, you promised me I didn't need to worry about you being at the party.
I was trying to work out where Michael got the porn from. Here!<eos> Your computer.<eos> He got it from you!<eos> That is not what's going on.<eos> What are you even doing with it?<eos> - Look, everybody has it!<eos> All right?<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> I don't!<eos> Right, and you're the normal one, are you?
No. No.<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come on.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> He's not gonna win, Mum.<eos> We shouldn't have to be scared.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> If you forgive me.
Can you get to the Farm Shop urgently?<eos> - We're heading somewhere else.<eos> - I think we've found the twine that was used to tie up Trish Winterman.<eos> - Stop the car.<eos> - No. Will you stop the bloody car!<eos> It's just stuff that got left in the cab.<eos> Why are you keeping it?<eos> Why aren't you giving it back?<eos> I didn't know whose it was.<eos> A woman has been raped and you've got her keys.
There's his car and there's his registration.<eos> Very good, Miller.<eos> You should do this for a living.<eos> And that licence plate belongs to...<eos> Swaggery little shit!<eos> Do you remember when we came and looked at this house?<eos> You walked into that kitchen, you looked out of the window, and you said, "Imagine living somewhere like this. Imagine having that view every morning."<eos> And I knew then... this... That was it. Decision made.<eos> I was right, though, wasn't I?<eos> Well, you're always right.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry, Dad. Sorry.<eos> Dad, I'm sorry.<eos> All right, lads.<eos> - Come on. Let's play.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Has he done that before?<eos> You can't let him do it again.<eos> The rest of us won't. Oi!<eos> You're a big man.
Look at them.<eos> Old pissed people wishing they were still young.<eos> That's her.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> I'd fuck her.<eos> Throw us one.<eos> For your information, she's actually very passionate.<eos> Then be very happy at home.<eos> Oh, Trish.<eos> So you can smoke and flirt with everybody at the bloody party.
What's that for?<eos> Shut up and help me lift.<eos> Mate, this isn't good.<eos> She's for you, man.<eos> You've had a young one, try something else.<eos> No.<eos> She's... she's ready.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I put myself on the line for you and you say it's not right.
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.<eos> I released the slave Guthred and saw him crowned King of Cumbraland.<eos> I fell in love with his sister while commanding his troops.<eos> I wish to be seen as Sigefrid's equal.<eos> I ask that you offer your sister in marriage.
And what do we call everything south of the wall?<eos> That will one day be England.<eos> Aethelflaed, it would cost a great deal of both blood and silver to conquer these lands, even more to hold the ground.<eos> And so alliances must be forged.<eos> Unions made.<eos> I am to be married?<eos> Once a suitable match has been made.<eos> I am ready to do my duty.<eos> There is a beauty to a burning village.<eos> It's like you said
- I am.<eos> I've been told that you took a man, a warrior, from Guthred of Eoferwic.<eos> You sold him as a slave.<eos> I see the faces of so many creatures.<eos> - I'm not here to open your belly, Jonis.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I'll pay you.<eos> Here.<eos> You will not feed the slaves!<eos> And you will not bark like a great, fat hound!
