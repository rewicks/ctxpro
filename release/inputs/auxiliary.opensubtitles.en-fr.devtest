Let's go around back.<eos> I'm gonna untie you now, and then you're gonna stand up and walk towards me.<eos> Please. Please don't do this.<eos> It'll all be over in a moment.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Kenneth's in jail.<eos> I'll kill her.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
And while I was cleaning the bones, I noticed crushing injuries to the thyroid cartilages which indicate the use of a broad surface in the attempted strangulation.<eos> Which is a submission move typically used by people in the military.<eos> Booth was right.<eos> This was a trained killer.<eos> I found cause of death.<eos> You can see from Sweets' heart.<eos> The aorta was torn.<eos> Which happened when the killer struck his chest, causing inward fracturing of ribs three through eight on the left side.<eos> I just wish that we'd never uncovered this whole conspiracy.<eos> But we did.
Yet.<eos> Look... you gonna throw me off this case again?<eos> No.<eos> You do what you have to.<eos> You don't even need to send me reports.<eos> And I'm sorry about Sweets.<eos> I wish to hell I could turn back the clock.<eos> Wow, no reports.<eos> Never heard of that happening.<eos> It doesn't.
I don't know.<eos> It's a ploy.<eos> She wants you to set a date.<eos> It's a standard move.<eos> She'll be back.<eos> Do you play video games?<eos> Ed. Don't ever! ... do that again.<eos> My apologies, Detective.<eos> Do either of you play video games?<eos> I do, I...
And if I'm being truthful and honest... I still want to be with you.<eos> I want us to tell everyone what happened and just... Run away together.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> It's over.<eos> For real, this time.<eos> Ah... I had a feeling you might say that.<eos> Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us.<eos> - My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies.<eos> Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.<eos> - No, he really does.
(Stammers) I'm not sure.<eos> What?<eos> (Stammers) I don't remember anything from last night.<eos> (Scoffs) Yeah, that's not a good explanation.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> Oh, you know, the usual.<eos> Had a couple drinks, came back here.<eos> D-did we, uh, did we have sex?<eos> Come on, yeah.<eos> Of course we did.
!<eos> - Luisa, you got to stay calm.<eos> - We were, we were lovers!<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> Rafael: The doctor has - medications to give you.<eos> - She's lying!<eos> She's lying!<eos> Stop lying!<eos> I don't know what I did to trigger this...<eos> - You didn't do anything.
Luckily, there are so many to choose from.<eos> Without betraying his old ones, I trust.<eos> I don't think my husband needs a lecture from you on betrayal.<eos> Do you accuse me of something?<eos> Oh, many things, I'm sure.<eos> But let's start with the betrayal of promises.<eos> Unless somehow your grain has arrived beneath our notice.<eos> She speaks for you in this?<eos> "She" is my queen.<eos> And, yes, she does.
Timmy, Timmy.<eos> Timmy, Timmy. Timmy, Timmy.<eos> - Hey, wake up, you little scab. - T-t-Timmy?<eos> We got a message for ya from The Union.<eos> Just imagine it, Mimsy.<eos> A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want.<eos> It's going to be awesome.<eos> Well, well. Hello, gentlemen.<eos> I understand you've taken care of our little problem?<eos> Yeah, we sure did.
I remember you.<eos> From before, when we could be outside back in arcadia.<eos> That's right.<eos> How do you like it here?<eos> Mama and daddy wanted to leave before they...<eos> You know...<eos> Before they went away.<eos> They were sick, jenny.<eos> The people here didn't want you to be sick, too.<eos> Neither did your parents.
His name is robert.<eos> I call him robbie.<eos> It's for me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You promise?<eos> You'll come back?<eos> I promise.<eos> I promise... everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Why do grownups lie?<eos> They don't.
We should call in outside reinforcements.<eos> No, if Ward saw them coming,<eos> - he'd take them all down with him.<eos> - So, what's the plan?<eos> Get a fast, clean shot.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, but you need to listen to me.<eos> - You were an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - Please, just go.<eos> - Do you recognize these symbols?<eos> - No, no, I don't.
Why'd you hide it from me?<eos> - I was trying to protect you.<eos> - I should've been the first person you told!<eos> I could've taken care of it, or something.<eos> - Now it just looks like we're hiding it. - I just...<eos> I didn't... I didn't think there was anything you could do.<eos> And-and why is that?<eos> Because... I don't know!<eos> Because you don't see me as a cop.<eos> None of you do.
Just date him.<eos> It's a dumb rule.<eos> - It's against the rules.<eos> - Take the hat.<eos> - Oh. - Now, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.<eos> And no date leaves until everyone is laid.<eos> I just want to meet a nice fella.<eos> Can I have permission to send them home<eos> - without sex?<eos> - No, you do not.
Wait, doesn't she work or... ?<eos> Shouldn't you be studying?<eos> Or live somewhere?<eos> Shouldn't you be studying?<eos> - Or have worried loved ones?<eos> - Studying?<eos> Coach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.<eos> But I'm on to her.<eos> I didn't know girls could be so slovenly.<eos> I did.
Welcome to prison.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> You just tell me how you hacked into NASA, and I promise everything will be okay.<eos> Should Happy and Paige be here?<eos> They're talking to you.<eos> Sergey Antonovich and Roman Volkovsky's cell.<eos> Russian outfit.<eos> Both doing a dime for identity theft.<eos> Well, clearly scumbags, but they don't seem to have the technical acumen to break out of this place.<eos> This one does.
So comms off.<eos> We'll drive halfway there, then we'll hoof it so they don't hear our approach.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Target's 800 yards on the other side of the compound.<eos> So you'll be safe here.<eos> See you when we got the bad guys.<eos> My team, with me!<eos> It looks like Percy's getting close to finishing that code for them.<eos> He's Morse-coding again.<eos> "Near... done.
We're just talking.<eos> So he got to you.<eos> He didn't give me any choice.<eos> And you've been out of the picture so long, people started talking.<eos> Saying what?<eos> You're vulnerable.<eos> Well... if he was able to turn you, my dear Gino,<eos> I can only imagine that he's approached everyone.<eos> Do you know if he's gotten to Bruce?<eos> I don't.
John's running with the mob?<eos> I'm there.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I'm sorry, that's out of the question.<eos> Harold.<eos> Good-bye, Ms. Shaw.<eos> What the hell does he think he's doing?<eos> Trying to protect you.<eos> I don't need protection, okay?<eos> I do the protecting.
It's like we're in the middle '80s.<eos> Eliza: Okay.<eos> I'm still super mad, but you just rode the crap out of that horse.<eos> Eliza, I'm sorry.<eos> I wasn't listening to you.<eos> You weren't hurting me this weekend.<eos> You were helping me.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> - You got the promotion?<eos> - I did.
Eliza: Okay.<eos> I'm still super mad, but you just rode the crap out of that horse.<eos> Eliza, I'm sorry.<eos> I wasn't listening to you.<eos> You weren't hurting me this weekend.<eos> You were helping me.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> - You got the promotion?<eos> - I did.<eos> I did.
Where'sthemoney?<eos> Payment for those books was made weeks ago.<eos> I was just delivering them to the buyer.<eos> Let me ask you a question:<eos> Do you enjoy this game you're playing?<eos> Obviously not.<eos> I'm tied to a chair in a windowless room with no cameras, and I haven't the faintest idea why.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Sure you do. You know exactly why.<eos> No, I don't.
I didn't get to go to his funeral.<eos> Or Mom's.<eos> Or Hannah's.<eos> You were still in the hospital.<eos> Did you?<eos> Go to your father's funeral?<eos> Why not?<eos> I wasn't allowed.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> I do.
And I could call a headhunter tomorrow.<eos> I could get a job job, and I could get the luncheonette off my plate.<eos> I could do that, and it would make my life a lot easier.<eos> You could.<eos> You could absolutely do all of that, but you won't.<eos> Honey, that's not who you are.<eos> You don't just get into something and just walk away from it.<eos> I've known you for so long... Kristina and I know that deep down, you actually--I don't know. You like it.<eos> You like helping people.<eos> No, I don't.
But, plus, how did they get onto a commercial flight without proper documentation?<eos> Unless you don't fly commercial.<eos> Homeland security is loathe to inconvenience the rich and powerful.<eos> Pull information on private jets departing the same days our victims were abducted.<eos> Crosscheck tail numbers.<eos> See if you can find a pattern.<eos> Private property.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't know anyone was here.<eos> - Well, now you do.
They're running tests on her blood, but I think she's over the virus.<eos> Without the medication?<eos> That's how it looks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, you could have told me.<eos> And what... burden you?<eos> No, I could have helped you...<eos> If you'd just let me in.<eos> I didn't want it to define me.<eos> It doesn't.
We also found $10,000 cash in her purse and $5,000 worth of presents in her room.<eos> Why were they visiting?<eos> On vacation from North Dakota.<eos> We haven't notified her yet because, uh...<eos> Because our dancing Santa wasn't the only one packing.<eos> It's for ladies... get it? ...<eos> With the pink.<eos> And it's a 9-millimeter.<eos> I have a right to bear arms.<eos> Not without a permit, you don't.
Who's that?<eos> Hey, turkey water!<eos> Pfft! Weak!<eos> I... I'm it!<eos> And just like that, the Thanksgiving we never wanted to remember turned into one we'd never forget.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> And, uh, just so you know, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, I did.
I have kids with the man, yes. I have feelings for him.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Stop pressuring me.<eos> Pressuring you?<eos> Okay, Julia, all right.<eos> Pressure's off.<eos> We want to talk to you about what happened with Dylan, because I feel like we owe you an apology.<eos> I don't feel like we really gave you the full picture about what can happen in relationships.<eos> Remember when we talked about the numbers scale and how things can change?<eos> Well, sometimes they don't.
Damn vaccine makes me crave sugar.<eos> Well if you start craving brains, let me know.<eos> Puppies and kittens.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> It won't be long now, my child.<eos> Rest.<eos> You are going to a much better place.<eos> Murphy.<eos> Considering the situation...<eos> How did you...
Look at me.<eos> Murphy!<eos> You.<eos> You set me up, you bastard.<eos> - You set us all up!<eos> - No! No, I didn't.<eos> I had no idea this was gonna happen.<eos> I swear.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> - No, I don't!
$50.<eos> Although, you do make four times as much as I do so whatever that means to you.<eos> A little order in the court please, alright?<eos> Freshen up, settle down, and can you toss me a couple of those juice boxes, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your Honor, in the spirit of moving things along...<eos> Yes, Counselor.<eos> Given the heat and the fact that the defense has already pled no contest, I'd really like to get to Mrs. Bullock's petition for leniency.<eos> Unless, of course, the prosecution wants to do a whole song and dance about maximum sentencing.<eos> Oh, we do.
- There we go.<eos> Coming through, coming through.<eos> Watch out, watch out. Coming through, coming through.<eos> Hey, hey, take it easy with that.<eos> - I made that for Coulson. - Wow.<eos> Hey, you know, if you're looking for vacation time, bribery will get you nowhere, 'cause I've tried.<eos> No, I'm hoping he'll let me work on the real thing.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> And so how do you get it to fly?<eos> - It doesn't. - Aww.
Ryan and I did some real police work and found a Carlucci connection to the murder.<eos> Yeah, wait.<eos> What kind of a connection?<eos> Well, turns out the family's number two, Christopher Carlucci, owns a black Mustang.<eos> Guess what was stashed inside?<eos> A Santa suit.<eos> With blood on it.<eos> Christopher Carlucci, we need to talk.<eos> Why did you kill Eric Mercer?<eos> I didn't.
Who killed Eric?<eos> You come in here, to my house of business, and accuse my daughter of not one but two murders?<eos> Not accuse, as much as...<eos> Perhaps she's a person of interest.<eos> You think I don't know what that means?<eos> You disappoint me, Rick.<eos> I came to you.<eos> I put my faith in you.<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> We did. We do.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) Okay, and... (BEEPING)<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> That's not even a clever alias.<eos> You know, this guy might be using that alias to withdraw his cash, but I bet he created the account remotely.<eos> You think you can trace the account back to the computer it originated from?<eos> I think you should tell Christopher he's sleeping over New Year's Eve, too.<eos> Rita determined Il Penumbra's Cayman account was opened using a server at the Midtown Library branch.<eos> Public terminal.<eos> Makes sense. Especially since most libraries don't have security cameras.<eos> But the convenience store across the street from this one does.
I thought you might be cold out here.<eos> - You're so sweet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> You seem out of sorts.<eos> - Sorry. I've just been thinking about something toph said.<eos> She told me that the world doesn't need me And it's basically pointless to try to stop kuvira.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - At the time, I thought so too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self, But I'm beginning to think she had a point.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
I can't!<eos> You can. Accept what happened to you.<eos> Don't fear what might have been.<eos> I have no control!<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I made it...<eos> And you led me here.<eos> Do you know where Jinora and the others are?<eos> No, but you do.
Well, what about Ivy? Is she there, too?<eos> Tripp drove her and two others across the border last night.<eos> Well, do you know where Tripp is now?<eos> He's running down another lead, but he didn't tell me what it was.<eos> Well, can you find out?<eos> We need to know who his next target is.<eos> If Enzo talks, it'll be you guys.<eos> Well, that's not going to happen because we're busting him out, right, if for no other reason than so I can kick his ass for getting caught in the first place.<eos> You have any idea how he even managed to get his hands on it?<eos> He didn't.
There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.<eos> And if we want to help Javi out, then the best thing that we can do is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this, and some of those answers might be at his apartment.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check it out and let you know.<eos> Kate, is it true... what they're saying?<eos> Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this, and we're gonna get him out of there, I promise you.<eos> Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish, we've got eyes on Esposito.<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.<eos> They don't.
Obviously, the man is not at all who we thought he was.<eos> Jared, what are you doing, man?<eos> It's kind of self-explanatory, isn't it?<eos> Look, I know you're an activist and you're all about taking on the one percent, but do you see anybody like that here?<eos> Look, I may be a salesman, but just so you know, I'm not a big earner.<eos> Okay, I am barely scraping by.<eos> Jared, these are working people... your people.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Are you gonna block this?<eos> No, do not... do not block this!<eos> He has a girlfriend, Eliza!<eos> But they hardly ever see each other.<eos> And Henry and I see each other all the time.<eos> Well, then maybe I should be in love with Henry.<eos> I see him all the time, too.<eos> Okay, straight-up girl code.<eos> If you have feelings for Henry, I will legit step aside.<eos> But if you don't...
Is your mom with you when you're kicking back?<eos> It depends on work schedules.<eos> Kayla, can I ask you, um...<eos> While you're kicking back with him on your own, has Bill ever asked you to keep a secret from your mom?<eos> If it's called a secret, I can't tell you.<eos> Well... but...<eos> It's my job to hold on to secrets and not tell anyone.<eos> Mom can't know.<eos> - Promise not to tell.<eos> - I do.
No. No.<eos> Uh... I've been losing friends this morning.<eos> - Why? - This article.<eos> This, uh, thought project from a while back... uh, it's been sent to the press...<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> I am pro-Israel.<eos> Yes, I, uh...<eos> I saw it.<eos> I don't like losing friends.<eos> I don't either.
She took two girls into the woods, stabbed one, stabbed herself, killed a cat.<eos> I'd call at least one of those a sign.<eos> And we don't think Mia is involved?<eos> Nah.<eos> I have an easier time believing that she's under Perry's spell...<eos> she's scared to death... than believing that she stabbed her own sister and left her for dead.<eos> What do you recommend?<eos> Do you have any proof of conspiracy... emails, texts, posting on social media?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Shoot guns?<eos> [Laughs]<eos> What?<eos> Wow, thank you for laughing so hard at me shooting a gun.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm, like, trying to picture you with a firearm.<eos> It's not really clicking.<eos> Well, there's not much to see.<eos> I didn't even...
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Most of them viewed their predecessors as road maps.<eos> They read their résumés as recipes to be followed.<eos> But you've never made an effort to do that.<eos> No.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But you still want to do covert work?<eos> Be an undercover agent?<eos> Yes.<eos> More than anything, I do.
Don't ask us-- ask them.<eos> You're in their custody now.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're the ones who will find out what you actually know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> Where are they taking me?<eos> We don't know.<eos> No one does.
But it's still upsetting, so I'm just...<eos> I'm gonna go see my sister.<eos> And you just stay here handcuffed where you can't hurt anybody...<eos> but me... with your words.<eos> My parents... that's not who they are.<eos> They're their worst selves.<eos> It's like when Anna put me in that urn.<eos> She didn't mean what she said either...<eos> I hope.<eos> I didn't.
Ye of little faith.<eos> Tomorrow night, when the stars in the sky align with the stars in the hat, I shall finally cleave myself from this dagger and be on the other side of that ice wall before dawn.<eos> Are you saying there's a bloody way out of here?<eos> Dark One always finds a way.<eos> Well, if the Dark One is so powerful, why doesn't he magic his grandson to his side?<eos> Because that would require me knowing where his mothers have locked him away for safekeeping.<eos> Now unless you really, really have no need for that tongue, I suggest you slither back outside into the hostile current and find Henry.<eos> You'll be needing this.<eos> You won't win.<eos> Villains never do.
So we can remember just how badly you treated us?<eos> The funny thing about time is we romanticize the good and forget the bad.<eos> That's exactly what's in these crystals.<eos> These are the good memories and nothing else.<eos> Lovely moments the two of you shared with me, which I'll cherish forever and now so will you.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but magic can't make someone love you.<eos> You're right, Emma. Magic can't create love.<eos> But if someone loved you in the past, it can make them love you again.<eos> And I know you've forgotten, Emma, but you did love me.<eos> You both did.
My apartment is not that different than yours, Danny.<eos> You have your piano.<eos> I have a children's xylophone.<eos> In addition to my musical instruments, to distract us, we also have sex.<eos> - Give me!<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> Now wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> Can we even do this?<eos> I thought you had to teach residents.<eos> Mm, I did.
Excuse me?<eos> We're having a private men's salon.<eos> Stay, leave.<eos> Do leave, though.<eos> Okay, well, that's all very rude.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, I was looking for you.<eos> I am so sorry that I didn't make it home last night.<eos> Did you find anything to do?<eos> Oh yeah, he did.
Why is your desk and all your stuff in my office?<eos> Obviously, I'm too heartbroken to work in Phlebotomy with Tamra.<eos> So you and I will be office mates unless...<eos> Dr. L, you wanna take me in?<eos> No.<eos> Dr. C?<eos> My man?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Dr. L?<eos> Maybe Danny does?
Just leave him, ma.<eos> Danny, I just want your mom to have a boyfriend so Valentine's day isn't you, me, and ma kissing at the top of the empire state building.<eos> That would never happen because ma and I like to get Chinese food, and then we watch goofy movies.<eos> You know what, Danny?<eos> I think that you are part of this problem.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yeah, your mom is overbearing and she's clingy, and she constantly leaves weight loss pamphlets in my purse.<eos> But she only does those things because you let her.<eos> I think you like her being around all the time.<eos> No, I don't!
Till we know the answer to that... request a security detail for Admiral Hume, and coordinate with the P.O.F.O., make sure that we're looped into the admiral's schedule.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Sebastian's got information.<eos> What we've got from the Drayer-Bell online chats.<eos> It's just the usual stuff people chat about when they're dating.<eos> Your usual and my usual are probably not the same.<eos> You know, stuff like what they did that day, TV shows they watch, what funny stuff they saw online.<eos> Is that what... you and your girlfriend chat about?<eos> I'm not being catfished.<eos> I didn't...
Eh.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> Where are you supposed to be?<eos> ! Garage!<eos> Don't let them in here.<eos> They're just looking for their passports.<eos> Now, I need you to put this human liver in the fridge.<eos> Why do you have a human liver?<eos> I don't.
Always coffee.<eos> And fear is always in your heart Because you or your loved ones could be the victim Of some hateful act<eos> Against the ideals of this country. That's why I fully support my husband Sending the u.S.S. Roosevelt into the gulf of guinea.<eos> Are we still talking china, mrs.<eos> Grant? Send the truman in.<eos> We're sending in the u.S.S. Roosevelt Michael:<eos> Black with a diabetic coma of sugar.<eos> I know all your weaknesses now, cy.<eos> Yes...<eos> You do.
Then that will be the truth of it.<eos> My job is not about finding the truth.<eos> It's about defending my client.<eos> Detective Murdoch, do you have something to say?<eos> Your Honour, we need to confirm that it was indeed Percival Thompson whom the night clerk saw on the night in question.<eos> I have a photograph of Mr. Thompson.<eos> How are we to know that this is in fact the defendant's husband?<eos> - Ask his wife.<eos> - The defense has no further questions.<eos> Well, I do.
I will make him a helpmate." And so from the soil, the Lord God fashioned all the wild beasts... '"<eos> - Father...<eos> The vows.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Of course. William Murdoch, do you take this woman to be your wife?<eos> Do you promise to be true to her in good times and bad, in sickness and in health, do you promise to love her and honour her all the days of your life?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Julia, take this man to be your husband?<eos> - Do you promise to...<eos> - I do. I truly do.
Maybe I got a raccoon.<eos> They're known to collect things.<eos> Raccoons put your blood in Denise's car?<eos> Where is she, John?<eos> Saving the girl may be the only thing that spares your life.<eos> My life is over.<eos> So is hers.<eos> So she's dead?<eos> If you believe John Neville.<eos> You don't.
Look...<eos> I'm your friend, okay?<eos> You got to talk to me.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> If a Hyde personality exists and if he's protecting Jesse, only way to bring him out is to make the alternate believe you're going to hurt the primary.<eos> You lied to us.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
No.<eos> And I got a girl dying out there.<eos> And I swear to you... you don't tell me what I need to know, what your father did to your arms there, child's play compared to what I'm gonna do.<eos> Stop.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Do you want me to hurt you Please-please... like your father did?<eos> 'Cause I'm willing Pride.<eos> to do whatever it takes to save that girl.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.

Grohl: Yeah, we got to learn "Two-Headed Dog."<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> - Smear: It was a good song. - Grohl:<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> Roky Erickson's voice is the most wickedly lovely, demonic sound.<eos> Vig: And one of the greatest screams...<eos> When he sings that first line of "Two-Headed Dog," man, it's just one of the best moments in rock and roll.<eos> Hawkins: What a goddamn pioneer.<eos> And I truly love psychedelic rock.<eos> I really do.
Ursula, darling, crush the maid's heart.<eos> That was, uh, a rather risky endeavor for an old glove, dearies.<eos> Oh, the risk was worth it.<eos> For too long we've lived in a world where the heroes always win.<eos> And the gauntlet will reveal our enemies' weaknesses, and we will be the victors.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Why... why would you do that?<eos> I... I... I mean, with that object... they still won't be able to harm you.<eos> Why do you care about me?<eos> I don't.
Please don't ask my mother for her opinions.<eos> You heard that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got superhearing.<eos> I hear everything.<eos> Only when you listen.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was I listening?<eos> - Why do you have a thing for me?<eos> - I don't.
Did I do something?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I'm in trouble.<eos> No, I'm in trouble 'cause when this changes I don't have anyplace to be.<eos> God...<eos> I used to be so careful.<eos> Wait, um...<eos> What's changing?<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> Yes, but it all changes, Alex.<eos> It always does.
Adios.<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> Muchas gracias.<eos> Bye.<eos> Por nada.<eos> Yes, Agent Hanna, this is the gym bag with the money.<eos> How much did you say was in here?<eos> I didn't.
Maggie will stick around after the service if anybody has any questions.<eos> Our closing hymn is "for the beauty of the Earth."<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Langston.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Just wanted to come by and check in on you, see how it's been going.<eos> Any trouble since you've come back?<eos> I imagine this isn't a social call, Agent Bellamy, so just state your business and let's get on with it, shall we?<eos> I know about the bones under the factory, the fire, the men who returned.<eos> And so does Fred.<eos> Does he, now?
I'm sure that you, me, and your mom are about to sit down and watch a movie together.<eos> Now, that's pretty unbelievable.<eos> - Yeah, it is. - Mm.<eos> Look, honey.<eos> Things can't be the way they used to be.<eos> I know that.<eos> But we can be friends.<eos> And I think we both need one right about now.<eos> Make sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
For a while now.<eos> I was going to wake her for dinner before it got too late.<eos> Uh, it's in the oven if you're hungry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good service today.<eos> You were in your element.<eos> I was proud of you.<eos> We're gonna need more than two dozen members if we're gonna keep the utilities on.<eos> They'll come.<eos> They always do.
They returned and were murdered.<eos> Your dad asked me not to pursue it anymore, so I'm not going to.<eos> Does he think my family murdered those men?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Only Margaret knows all the details.<eos> I'm not even sure she does.<eos> I lied.<eos> When I said you didn't know anything about me.<eos> You do.
I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> So, have you thought of a plan when they discover her remains are missing?<eos> They won't.<eos> The coroner needs a fresh corpse.<eos> That's why Eva Braga's bones were in storage.<eos> Do you seriously think a couple of dusty eggheads can help us find the killer?<eos> I guess you could say that science is a hobby of mine.<eos> I like to think that it could be the key to solving crimes.<eos> Don't you have faith in science?<eos> Course I do, darling.
- I believe him.<eos> - You're just trying to save your daughter.<eos> His daughter is brilliant, Jeeves.<eos> I wouldn't have been able to give this beautiful artist the victim's description without his daughter's visionary help.<eos> You really think I'm beautiful, Doc?<eos> The Golden Ratio is hard to argue with, Miss Montenegro.<eos> As is the forensic fact that the murder occurred three hours before<eos> Mr. Booth entered the house.<eos> You actually believe all this?<eos> Yes, I do.
Or maybe I should just say psycho.<eos> My predictions are not psychic.<eos> They're based on 500 years of watching humans act out of fear.<eos> And I have two more predictions for you.<eos> They're going to start rounding up troubled people.<eos> And your friends...<eos> Your friends will sell you out to save their own skin.<eos> You think I'm wrong?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you ever wonder if I'm real?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What if I'm like the bears?<eos> I lost my immunity to The Troubles after I was split from Mara.<eos> We don't even know if that happened.<eos> Maybe Duke didn't separate me from Mara.<eos> Maybe whatever trouble he used on her... Created me.<eos> - You're real.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hmm.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Huh? I was wondering if you knew the way... uh, I mean, I-I'm...<eos> - Oh, it's a girl you're after, eh? No! I-I mean, yes, but...<eos> Oh, you're not the witless simple-minded fool everybody takes you for.<eos> - Everyone thinks I'm... - You're the young lover.<eos> - What?<eos> Young lover? No, uh... - If you really want to get<eos> I-I mean, I-I... well, here's what you do.<eos> - I-I don't.
Rudy said that Izzy had audiotapes in his car.<eos> So what if Izzy had found the proof that he needed, and now that proof has burned up with him inside the car?<eos> Yeah, only now, there's no way of knowing what was actually on Pepper's old audiotapes.<eos> Although there is a way of figuring out who might have destroyed them...<eos> Whoever owns the rights to "6 A.M."<eos> Al Rainey.<eos> C.E.O. of Dovebird Records.<eos> He owns Lionel Hubbard's publishing<eos> He's a guy who's made a career off of fleecing musicians.<eos> How... how did you...
A poet.<eos> It seems to me to be about glory.<eos> [speaking German] [imagining Mozart music] [running footsteps]<eos> [whistling]<eos> Maestro.<eos> - [music stops]<eos> - Hailey.<eos> Oh, can you... can you knock?<eos> Just knock, knock?<eos> I did.
- No, listen.<eos> You were a tad late in the adagio.<eos> That only happens when you're a little high.<eos> Let's not argue.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> You did beautifully up there, Maestro.<eos> That means more to me coming from you than anything else in the world.<eos> "And all we men and women, we're merely players."<eos> [screams] Oh, my God!<eos> You did it.
Thank you, and sorry again.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> There was a Do-Not-Resuscitate form.<eos> The nurses told you about it, but you did it anyway.<eos> The patient was conscious.<eos> Whatever.<eos> There's a protocol.<eos> If there's a DNR order, you have to check with a supervisor to override it.<eos> I didn't...
OK?<eos> Right.<eos> Last time, you said about your father's job:<eos> "That must be a classic".<eos> What's "classic"?<eos> It seems obvious to me.<eos> The obedient, well-behaved girl who listens to her dad and ends up doing the same job as him.<eos> I didn't see it that way.<eos> Does he have something to do with your career?<eos> "Something to do"?
How?<eos> I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.<eos> No.<eos> That would require forethought.<eos> Do you know once he actually tried to raise chickens in our kitchen?<eos> Who do you think had to clean up after those damn birds?<eos> Me!<eos> My whole life, I've been taking care of him, defending him from bullies, protecting him from my father.<eos> Do you know why I didn't go off to art school?<eos> No, I don't.
It's hard to tell nowadays. They act older than their age<eos> Look.<eos> Let's follow them.<eos> Thanks. Stop by to sign the report tomorrow<eos> Won't you at least take me home?<eos> Can you see a meter here?<eos> This isn't a taxi<eos> Wait! You're not going to leave me?<eos> Hop it. We have to work<eos> What, and I don't? Fine.
Hey, you pass out on me?<eos> This is detective antonio dawson of the chicago police department Requesting an ambulance And immediate backup to 1601 north kingsbury.<eos> I have a victim with a gunshot wound to the head.<eos> . - When i realized he was shot, i got out of the car, Opened his door, checked his pulse,<eos> And then i saw this.<eos> Our victim's a diamond dealer. It looks like a robbery gone sideways.<eos> - How long were you in the store?<eos> - I walked in, bought the cigarettes, walked back.<eos> I didn't have a stopwatch.<eos> - You always do the shopping for this guy?
So, quite frankly, I think you're hiding something from me.<eos> This warrant is worthless without being cosigned by a military judge.<eos> I don't need JAG approval, and you know it.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> Yes, sir. Move out.<eos> You really want to cooperate with me, give me the decryption key for the code from the black box on Holland's wingsuit.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Black boxes are Air Force property, and if you want access, you're gonna have to talk to them.<eos> You know what that is, right, Major?<eos> Yes, I do.
I...<eos> I would've been a good son.<eos> I would've helped him.<eos> He's beautiful.<eos> Absolutely perfect.<eos> You did it.<eos> He looks like Lance, doesn't he?<eos> I-I'm not imagining that, am I?<eos> No.<eos> No, he really does.
Oh, why is everyone so judgmental?<eos> It's worse out there, in the countryside, which is why I want to stay here.<eos> It's not a return to court you desire.<eos> It's the very best place to be a princess.<eos> It's your mother's attention.<eos> Why would I want anything from her?<eos> She doesn't love me.<eos> Not the way she loves Francis or any of her other children.<eos> You're right.<eos> She doesn't.
And put on that jacket?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I wouldn't let Artie touch me.<eos> Well, I'll have you know that you're not really Artie's type anyway.<eos> I used to be.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know, I lived on the street down here after my dad died?<eos> Um, no.<eos> No, I didn't, uh...
No.<eos> But being a detective and all...<eos> I'm pretty good at looking.<eos> She has a lot of enemies.<eos> She's candid, calls it like she sees it.<eos> If it's the truth.<eos> It's a good read.<eos> It's compelling.<eos> I'm getting the sense she really loved her husband.<eos> Until she didn't.
I know that voice.<eos> That's Tom Wade.<eos> She's never gonna be with you, you understand?<eos> She... she doesn't... she hates you.<eos> Not according to the book, OK?<eos> I read it.<eos> She loves me.<eos> Did love you.<eos> Past tense.<eos> Did.
I have a request that's gonna make us both uncomfortable.<eos> - Great.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> - You heard about Cary's trial?<eos> - He lost a juror.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We need to find Dante.<eos> He's the only one still alive who can testify that Cary's innocent, that the wire was edited.<eos> - You know I can't say anything.<eos> - I do.
Keep saying stuff like that.<eos> Remember, Ronny- stay gay.<eos> Looks great, Ma.<eos> Can you not say exactly what I say?<eos> Aw, it's like when you guys had that secret twin language.<eos> We never had a secret twin language.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Bee-daw-ka-koo.<eos> I don't know what he means.<eos> Yeah, you do.

- She was shot.<eos> I need to get away from all this.<eos> I know a way out of here you can escape without being seen.<eos> Come on.<eos> I had Belenko, and I lost him, and now he's got Auggie.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> Tell me what happened to James Deckard.<eos> He's dead.<eos> You're not going to shoot me, Annie, because you want Auggie to live.<eos> I, however, do not.
I'm gonna fix that.<eos> The Troubles are not a punishment.<eos> They're genetic.<eos> Audrey's right.<eos> We have scientific proof.<eos> Aren't you listening, mom?<eos> Maybe if you weren't the way you are, this would have never have happened to me.<eos> No, Sam.<eos> It's okay, Sam.<eos> I didn't...
Why?<eos> To fix you.<eos> I'm on board, Duke.<eos> Find the aether, and we could do that a thousand times over.<eos> You have an angry energy, and I like that in bed.<eos> Do you believe me that I want to help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I have to, right?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You do.
It's okay.<eos> Come here. Yeah.<eos> Did he just stop crying?<eos> He hates me.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, like everybody hates me.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> He's just remembering how great it was when you were holding him, and that's why he stopped crying.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yes, I do.
Thanks for reminding me.<eos> Your apnea mask is on.<eos> What the hell...<eos> Mouth guard!<eos> What the hell is happening out here?<eos> Mindy, your boyfriend groped me.<eos> You are a beard.<eos> Oh, no. It's happening again.<eos> Why did you let Peter use our shower?<eos> She didn't.
I couldn't see it burned so badly.<eos> How long has she been a client?<eos> 6 weeks.<eos> I mean, she was always so nice.<eos> I don't know why she would do this to me.<eos> You're her second victim.<eos> She was talking you both in plain sight, getting to know you, sitting in your chair, figuring out your schedule.<eos> First victim was a bus driver Henry White.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> No, I don't.
She said, "no," but he forced her down.<eos> And the Cori tried to run.<eos> And I grabbed her, and I held her down until he could finish.<eos> That explains the nails in your hands.<eos> She wanted you to feel her pain.<eos> You stood there, watched, did nothing.<eos> That's why Cori burned your eyes.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I loved him so much.<eos> I still do.
No one's saying you aren't.<eos> But you don't believe me.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter what you think because there's nothing you can do.<eos> Statute of limitations ran out years ago.<eos> I gave them every opportunity to apologize.<eos> I rode Henry's bus, sat in Sophia's chair, hung out at Scott's favorite bar.<eos> Not one of them ever recognized me.<eos> You've changed, Cori.<eos> I know that...<eos> No, you don't.

Hey, I'm hearing great things about you as a firefighter.<eos> Oh. [Chuckles] That's nice.<eos> Everything else good?<eos> [Sighs] One day at a time.<eos> Well, keep it up.<eos> You make me so proud.<eos> Don't be crying poor on me, Capp.<eos> I know what your side job pulls in, come on.<eos> You don't even know what my side job is.<eos> Sure I do.
I should have told you who I was.<eos> I had my reasons.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm not here just to take part in the contest.<eos> I'm here to win the heart of Ariadne.<eos> I know - it's not our custom.<eos> If my father had his way, I'd be here with 100 attendants.<eos> But I wanted Ariadne to see me, not them.<eos> And does the Queen know of your intentions?<eos> She does.
Perhaps.<eos> Come on, Jason.<eos> Oh, he caught him.<eos> It'll need binding.<eos> The Gods smiled on you.<eos> Ariadne.<eos> You did Atlantis proud.<eos> And my Queen?<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Did you put the seat down?<eos> I never put it up.<eos> Can I have a snack?<eos> Do we have snacks?<eos> Let's see.<eos> Take a load off.<eos> When a guy named Charlie lived here, I had to keep this cabinet stocked with coke co powder.<eos> Because he loved hot chocolate.<eos> I like hot chocolate.<eos> Not like he did.
Tell me where you got this.<eos> - Everybody down!<eos> - On the ground!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Keep your hands on the table! Don't look at me!<eos> All right, I want everyone to stay where they are.<eos> I got ten grand in the safe, just take it and don't kill anyone, okay?<eos> Downstairs!<eos> I don't know what you think you've heard, there's nothing down there.<eos> Do it!
All right, I just clocked out.<eos> I'm thinking you, me, beers at Molly's, then back to my place for a romantic microwave dinner.<eos> All right, I'm almost off, I'll meet you there.<eos> - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Just go.<eos> About Nadia.<eos> If you're gonna be mad, be mad at me.<eos> I should've been straight with you.<eos> As long as she understands, I give her a chance, she only gets one.<eos> She does.
We've got no chance if Mr Jefferies keeps behaving like a big wanker.<eos> I know.<eos> He just needs to let them see what a caring person he really is.<eos> Enter.<eos> So I'll be leaving Greenshoots soon, Mr J.<eos> True.<eos> Last few weeks.<eos> And I want to say thank you for everything you've done for me for the last seven years.<eos> Do you think I'm fat?<eos> Greg does, apparently.
He was weird. He never washed<eos> I got your file from social services<eos> I read your complaint, too<eos> Didn't you see? I took it back<eos> I'm not here to judge you, Karen<eos> This is just between us I'm not writing it down<eos> But I've got nothing else to say<eos> So, nothing happened?<eos> Ever?<eos> Delorme never did anything inappropriate?
If I could just...<eos> Give back the marbles you took from us, or we'll beat the crap out of you!<eos> What do you mean "took"?<eos> I won them. You didn't.<eos> Give them already.<eos> Give them.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Leave the kid alone.<eos> No way!<eos> What if we don't? What? What?
Speed up a little.<eos> What kind of driving is this?<eos> Get close. Speed up!<eos> Accountant!<eos> You're screwed, man.<eos> You're screwed.<eos> The van! Get in front of us!<eos> - Floor it!<eos> - Floor it, man!<eos> - Done, bro!
~ What else do you suggest?<eos> ~ No. ~ No. ~ No. ~ No. ~ No. ~ No. ~ No.<eos> It's minus-one.<eos> I am allergic to walking.<eos> HORSE WHINNIES Just... no.<eos> I know those horses we rode in Burma, they were like Caterhams.<eos> ~ These are like Ford Granadas.<eos> ~ How do you know?<eos> Cos they look like Ford Granadas.<eos> ~ They don't. ~ They do.
Walden?<eos> Can you come here?<eos> He didn't say "over," so it doesn't count.<eos> Oh, go check on him.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I've waited for two years, I can wait a little bit longer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Don't start without me.<eos> Or do.
And Curtis got 402.<eos> What?<eos> There's no winner.<eos> They all scored the same.<eos> No!<eos> What do I do now?<eos> It's kind of spooky.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like God wants you to have three boyfriends.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Okay, there must be other options for us.<eos> I've exhausted most of them.<eos> Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> How's it been going today?<eos> A guy called Brad came in looking for you.<eos> - Brad?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's banned from this clinic.<eos> Well, I didn't know who he really was, so I just...<eos> Of course you didn't.
[crying] I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> The cops are here to talk to you, Dr. Goran.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I'll come back once I've spoken with them.<eos> Sir, we take it very seriously when someone leaves the scene of a crime.<eos> I was the one who was attacked.<eos> And he's the one who's dead.<eos> So, how well did you know the victim?<eos> I didn't.
Would you look at all these credit card charges?<eos> I thought we agreed to cut down on our spending.<eos> I didn't agree.<eos> I said I thought it was a good idea, okay?<eos> And I still do.
I've sang, danced ...<eos> I felt real joy ...<eos> Then you should know better then anyone.<eos> You have seen children starve ...<eos> Yes.<eos> You have seen people stabbing on each other's neck ... Just for the view.<eos> You know what it is peoples like when men blow each others up.<eos> Yes<eos> - Over a simple land, sand ...<eos> - I do, I do.
Actually I used to work in the music industry.<eos> Really?<eos> I told you before that there was a singer I liked.<eos> I really liked that singer but when she was in a crisis<eos> I let her give up singing.<eos> I still regret doing that.<eos> You must have really cherished her.<eos> You're not going to give up singing because of what happened, right?<eos> Did she regret that she gave up singing?<eos> She probably did.
What kind of singer are you? How can you sing while looking down?<eos> Get down.<eos> Get down!<eos> I would rather drink than watch this.<eos> is spicy, spicier than hot pepper.<eos> President.<eos> Why did you come all the way here?<eos> I came to see you of course.<eos> Did you see everything?<eos> I did.
What?<eos> Hey, you're really scary!<eos> I didn't do-<eos> How can you take me here even though I was drunk.<eos> You came her with your own feet.<eos> What?<eos> Don't lie!<eos> How would I know to come to your house...?<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you perhaps...the reporters...
Jesus!<eos> Do you want me to step outside?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hannah Dempsey, Brooke Dalton.<eos> Hey, nice to meet you.<eos> Hi, so nice to meet you.<eos> Um, traffic was so bad all the way from Philly,<eos> I-I thought I had missed you.<eos> You did?
Don't move.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hannah Dempsey, Brooke Dalton.<eos> Hey, nice to meet you.<eos> Hi, so nice to meet you.<eos> Um, traffic was so bad all the way from Philly,<eos> I-I thought I had missed you.<eos> You did?<eos> I mean, you did.<eos> You did.
But maybe I picked the wrong guy.<eos> Nobody said I was smart.<eos> Yeah, well, five minutes ago, you said you loved him.<eos> Five minutes ago, you said I loved him.<eos> I haven't said it for a half hour.<eos> There's got to be a better way to do this.<eos> What is it?<eos> You got any bright ideas?<eos> You got another one of your fucking bright ideas?<eos> No, I don't, I don't.
Please, sir!<eos> To Orange, please.<eos> Orange.<eos> This is Orange.<eos> If you speak to Jéréme, tell him this is his last absence for sickness.<eos> For the whole year.<eos> I'm sick of him.<eos> We get lumbered with everything.<eos> If I had a license, I could have helped you.<eos> Yes, but you don't, Ivan.
You've been deceived.<eos> What did it feel like? What?<eos> Murdering an innocent man.<eos> I just want to know what it felt like.<eos> Must have been beautiful.<eos> What are you talking about, innocence?<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> Sex always made you stupid, ready to believe anything.<eos> You've just made me a very rich woman.<eos> Do me one last favor, lover.
- Do you take drugs?<eos> - No.<eos> What were you doing when it started?<eos> I was playing videogames with a friend.<eos> He said I looked weird, and there was something wrong with my eyes.<eos> You're having a mild allergic reaction.<eos> I'll get my supervisor.<eos> Try to remember anything unusual you might have eaten.<eos> - I need Dr. Clément.<eos> - Of course you do.
- Tonight!<eos> - What?<eos> That'll make me the most respected man in this town.<eos> They'll have no choice but to give me a white hat.<eos> They'll parade me into the Tasting Room on their shoulders.<eos> And I'm not gonna let that be ruined by some little boxtroll sewer rat.<eos> Yoo-hoo!<eos> Madame Frou Frou!<eos> You promised your snookums a dance!<eos> I did?
You knew about this?<eos> This thing?<eos> The whole time?<eos> Why didn't you...<eos> - kill it when you had the chance? - It was absorbing... radiation from the reactors.<eos> We worried killing it... might release that radiation and endanger millions.<eos> That's why our mission was to contain it. To study its biology, to understand it.<eos> We knew the creature was having an electrical effect... on everything within a close proximity.<eos> What we didn't know... was that it could harness this same power... in an EMP attack.<eos> But your father did.
It's not me.<eos> Open your eyes, Lucile.<eos> Our men are no better than them.<eos> Some of them are much worse.<eos> Ask your officer.<eos> He knows.<eos> Ask him what he's read in those letters.<eos> Ask him what he's read about your husband.<eos> You need to know.<eos> Everybody else does.
The way a woman keeps her kitchen is the way she keeps her man.<eos> I ought to know.<eos> Mom... in the interest of me keeping my sanity... I think we should establish some clear-cut boundaries.<eos> Boundaries.<eos> After 74-and-a-half hours in labor, struggling to give you life.<eos> This is how you thank me?<eos> Well, you're welcome.<eos> And I am leaving.<eos> Mom?<eos> And do me a favor, Pig-pen.
Sir, you must!<eos> Hey, my brother, I'm Calvin.<eos> Let me help you with your bag.<eos> I'm good, bro.<eos> You can't go in there with liquids and gels.<eos> You got any?<eos> Cabbie, cabbie!<eos> Stop!<eos> Brother, you don't have no lotion or nothing?<eos> No, I don't.
What?<eos> You're getting married tomorrow.<eos> What are you doing here with me?<eos> Well, you know I'm getting married tomorrow.<eos> - What are you doing here with me'?<eos> - Oh, see, I do have an answer.<eos> I... like you.<eos> I liked you from the moment that I saw you.<eos> None of which matters if you love Lisa.<eos> Do you?
I ain't giving you shit.<eos> I'm just wondering where you're getting the money to bet with.<eos> - Borrowed it. - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who from?<eos> Huh?<eos> - Who from?<eos> - John Petty.<eos> Motherfucker gave me a tip, it didn't pay off.<eos> Well, of course he did.
I'll be around.<eos> Dan.<eos> - Where you going now?<eos> - No, it's good.<eos> - Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.<eos> - Hey. I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.<eos> Then get me an address for DeGroat.<eos> How am I gonna get that address?<eos> Don't give me that shit, Dan. You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.<eos> Well, I don't...
She tends to land on her feet.<eos> John!<eos> What you gonna do, Counsellor?<eos> Shoot me?<eos> That's right.<eos> Guess I cut out the wrong brother's heart.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> You boxed in law school.<eos> What the hell?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.
Alias. Cover story.<eos> Contact.<eos> Evac number.<eos> Right?<eos> Well, the only difference is to fully test the security of the system it's essential that none of you know the location of the incarceration.<eos> Will that present a problem?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it would.<eos> When do we start?<eos> We just did.
I'll do it.<eos> But if I don't get out, I kill you.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> A successful breakout depends on three things, layout, routine, and help.<eos> But they've taken those away.<eos> For now.<eos> There's something under the box.<eos> I think it's a conduit.<eos> If it is, how do you know where it goes?<eos> I don't.
His fat ass reminds me of my first girlfriend.<eos> Nice.<eos> That guard over there could be a problem for us.<eos> He's always looking around.<eos> The Chicken Man.<eos> Chicken Man, right.<eos> My guess, Chickie's new here.<eos> Does everything by the book.<eos> How do you know when the shift ends?<eos> I don't.
But it will only give us half of our location.<eos> Bring Breslin.<eos> I'll explain how it works later, but first we've got to get it topside.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Ah!<eos> Welcome to your new home, Mr. Breslin.<eos> Section E.<eos> Waiting for inmates.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I do now.
Good thing, I bumped into his sister in the next pub, we went into the disableds and I bumped into her again.<eos> Sam tagged along for a while, but then I had to let her go.<eos> I had another date that night and her name was Amber.<eos> Nine pints in and it was us against the world.<eos> Things got mental in The Beehive, so we repaired to the bowls club or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck up.<eos> Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him.<eos> In the end, we blew off the last three pubs and headed for the hills.<eos> I remember sitting up there, blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes, seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break and knowing in my heart, life would never feel this good again.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It never did.
See?<eos> Come on, Sam. You know better than to believe Gary King.<eos> Oh, crumbs.<eos> Sam!<eos> You creepy bitches, get off!<eos> Chuck us a ciggie.<eos> Oh.<eos> Gary, what's happening?<eos> I told you in the disableds.<eos> Oh, yes, you did.
- Every day, growing up in Queens, this guy would pummel me at recess.<eos> Every day.<eos> What could I do?<eos> I was just a kid.<eos> A couple of years ago, I heard Ingrisano got in some legal trouble.<eos> The kind of trouble another guy could get himself out of easily.<eos> So I got involved.<eos> Now, he scratches his ass without permission, he spends a week in Rikers.<eos> Jack Valliant reminds me a lot of Johnny Ingrisano.<eos> You ever do any hunting?
You're not her!<eos> Why do you hate me, David?<eos> I know you do.<eos> You left home.<eos> You left me all alone with our sick mother.<eos> And lwasjust a kid.<eos> You made me lie.<eos> Every time she screamed your name, I told her you were coming to see her.<eos> Like you promised.<eos> But you never did.
No one I can trust, no one I can talk to.<eos> I hate my life sometimes.<eos> I really do.<eos> - No. - No, it's true.<eos> No matter how many people are around, I'm all by myself.<eos> Like, I'm with people-- they're not really my family or my friends.<eos> You know what that feels like?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
And we've been together how long?<eos> Well, that's kind of apples and oranges, if you think about it.<eos> It's four years.<eos> Four years.<eos> And I don't even have a key to your apartment.<eos> Look, I've been patient.<eos> Really. But how long do you expect me to wait?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I totally had you!<eos> - You did. Yeah.
"lest we die unbloomed."<eos> AI?<eos> That was beautiful, kid.<eos> You wrote that?<eos> You asked me to.<eos> Forget Columbia.<eos> Forget Ogden Nash.<eos> We join the merchant marines, sail the world until the war ends, then jump ship and make it to Paris for the liberation.<eos> And you don't speak French.<eos> Jack does.
- No, let's not leave it alone.<eos> I wish you both could see,<eos> ..the brainsick looks on your faces.<eos> Who is it?<eos> - Nobody. Forget it..<eos> Tell us, is he someone from school?<eos> How old is he, what's he do?<eos> I'm not telling you anything..<eos> You have to tell us something!<eos> - No, I really don't.
- Fear.<eos> I thought she said --<eos> How do you do that?<eos> You can't eat fear.<eos> Sure you can. I mean..<eos> What happens to you, when you feel afraid?<eos> Doesn't your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions?<eos> I don't know..<eos> Does it?<eos> It does.
I'm fine. Honey, thank you.<eos> I'll bet, this house must have heard a lot of Weston girl secrets.<eos> I get embarrassed just thinking about it.<eos> Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> Secret crushes, secret schemes.<eos> I can't imagine anything more delicate, or bittersweet.<eos> Some part of you girls I always identified with... no matter how old you get, a woman's hard-pressed to throw off that part of herself.<eos> That smells so good.<eos> It's apple. You want some?<eos> Sure, I do.
But do you really want that spoiled rich son-of-a-bitch fuck... to be your next president?<eos> Think about it.<eos> We'll cheer for you, Mr. Vice President.<eos> Thank you, Cecil.<eos> Let me ask you something, in all candor... as members of the Negro community, what are your biggest concerns?<eos> Now, come on now, boys.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Holloway, come on.<eos> Well, since you asked, sir...<eos> I did.
- Dude, I can sn...<eos> Oh, my God! I can't believe the size of this thing.<eos> It's like a giant fucking cornfield. It's enormous down here.<eos> It's crazy. Look at that. I-I-I feel like at any moment,<eos> Shoeless Joe Jackson could walk out of it and I could play catch with him.<eos> Krypton. I-I hear it's really nice. I-I have never been...<eos> You didn't hear that the Sun supernova and destroyed our entire race?<eos> I wanna wash dishes with it.<eos> Did it?<eos> I did not...
It's no coincidence.<eos> He bought that house to be near her.<eos> He threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night.<eos> He constantly asked about Daisy.<eos> I was just the first person that knew her.<eos> All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years.<eos> And now he just wants me to invite her over to tea.<eos> The modesty of it.<eos> Kind of takes your breath...<eos> - away, doesn't it?
But... both of us loved each other all that time. Didn't we?<eos> That's all.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> I can't speak about... what happened five years ago because I didn't know Daisy then.<eos> And I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her... unless you brought the groceries to the back door.<eos> But all the rest of that... is a goddamn lie.<eos> Daisy loved me... when she married me... - and she loves me now. - No.<eos> - No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no. - She does!<eos> She does, though.<eos> No, she does, though.
Now we'll become, you know, CERN Twitter junkies.<eos> I guess this is exciting.<eos> My logical self wants to be excited.<eos> My psychological self is very cautious.<eos> My parents are both Iranian and both physicists, and my father in particular had real political difficulties with the regime, and we had to go underground for a number of years, and we ended up escaping from Iran<eos> But then, through a number of wonderful accidents, we ended up in Canada.<eos> I got interested in physics when I was 13 or 14 years old.<eos> It just offered the way to combine the two things I really loved:<eos> mathematics and things in the natural world.<eos> You almost done?
Is that what we are now?<eos> 'Cause I thought we were explorers.<eos> Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.<eos> Right, well, you leave me no choice but to resign my duties.<eos> Come on, Scotty.<eos> You're giving me no choice, sir. I will not stand by...<eos> You're not giving me much of a choice.<eos> Will you just make an exception and sign...<eos> Do you accept my resignation or not?<eos> I do!

- Yeah, he knows.<eos> - Wants to do it his own way, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You can take him home.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As you can see, Mr. Cassidy, the last two procedures were not covered by insurance.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have extended coverage.<eos> You did.
So my parents are having this thing for my brother's engagement this weekend.<eos> You wanna go with me?<eos> To meet your parents?<eos> It's just dinner and drinks.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You sure I'm relationship material?<eos> You know what?<eos> It's...<eos> It's actually gonna be really boring.<eos> - Probably better if you don't.
Same floor.<eos> Same floor.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She has no rooms available next to each other.<eos> She's asking if we prefer "the dungeon", "the nurse's office..." Or the "mission to Mars."<eos> This'll do.<eos> Man on speakers'. Liftoff! We have a liftoff!<eos> Kind of homey, actually.<eos> Where do you plan on sleeping?<eos> I don't.
Where are they taking her?<eos> Where, you piece of shit?<eos> I no talk, gaijin.<eos> I never talk.<eos> Who hired you?<eos> Take me to Noburo.<eos> - Logan...<eos> - Take me to him.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> Do it.
Is it nice?<eos> Oh, it's quite nice.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hello, darling. Wave to the camera, darling.<eos> I'm not too sure about this one, Bruce.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I bet... You've been thinking about me a lot, haven't you, Bunty?<eos> I haven't stopped thinking about you.<eos> I bet they told you to ignore me, though.<eos> - Didn't they?
Oh, it's quite nice.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hello, darling. Wave to the camera, darling.<eos> I'm not too sure about this one, Bruce.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I bet... You've been thinking about me a lot, haven't you, Bunty?<eos> I haven't stopped thinking about you.<eos> I bet they told you to ignore me, though.<eos> - Didn't they?<eos> - Oh yes, they fucking did.
People ask me, "Carole, how do you and Bruce keep the spice in your marriage?"<eos> Well, I tell them it's really simple.<eos> - I'm just the ultimate tease.<eos> - "I'm just the ultimate tease.<eos> "Me and Bruce, we're not that different.<eos> "We know what we want.<eos> "We know how to get it.<eos> "Like this promotion he's going for.<eos> We both know he'll win.<eos> "And when he does,
What is a dream?<eos> What's real?<eos> Is life just a big stage, and are we all just...<eos> Bradley, snap out of it!<eos> Boys, enough!<eos> Don't look back, only forward, all right?<eos> We don't even know which way is forward.<eos> What is forward?<eos> Who even knows where we're going?<eos> I don't!
But I had to take it for my mom's sake.<eos> Mamochka?<eos> When she died, I had no one left but ballet... and my promise.<eos> Mamochka? Mama!<eos> So I jumped like a grasshopper and walked on my tippy toes and watched everyone else eat their cookies.<eos> You remember what this oil refinery was like when I bought it?<eos> Like a tomb.<eos> And now look.<eos> So tell me, why don't you want to modernize the plant now?<eos> Of course I do.
You have to be quiet or they get scared and stop shining.<eos> When I miss the sky, I come here.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Wanda?<eos> I heard what Uncle Jeb was saying.<eos> He thinks that Melanie might still be alive.<eos> Inside there with you, I mean.<eos> Jamie!<eos> Can that happen?<eos> Does it, Wanda?
People could have seen you.<eos> She went to church every fucking Sunday!<eos> She wore a cross around her neck.<eos> And did it make any difference? God turned a blind eye and let her die out here alone and afraid.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fucking God!<eos> - Come on, Ig.<eos> For whatever reason, in this crazy fucked up world, I was being punished.<eos> When they looked at me, they saw a devil.<eos> And maybe I did too.
Hey. I'm looking for Conor and Eleanor Ludlow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Conor. You think if I fall to my knees, everything will be all right?<eos> Well, no. I mean, losing a child's not an easy thing to explain.<eos> What the fuck do I have to explain?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You... Nothing. You don't have to explain anything.<eos> I...<eos> I just, I wanted you to have this. Do you know how many of you assholes we've had to deal with in the last couple of months?<eos> Um... no, I don't.
Fine, fine.<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This is so bad.<eos> You assholes, both of you. Such assholes.<eos> You don't care about anything.<eos> Jesus, you know what she means to me.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I-I didn't know, but it doesn't change anything, I swear.<eos> The hell it doesn't!
Why did you fall in love with her and ruin everything for me?<eos> I didn't fall in love with her.<eos> That's worse.<eos> You ruined everything.<eos> No, you ruined everything!<eos> First of all, I'm not in love with her, and I never was.<eos> But you slept with her anyway?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Okay, let's say I understand that.<eos> But you don't.
Well, nobody's perfect.<eos> Lena, you have great powers.<eos> I can teach you how to use them. I can teach you how to become the most powerful Dark Caster who ever lived.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you, Mama.<eos> Oh, baby. This mortal you think you love?<eos> You can never be together.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever love me, Mama?<eos> You know, I don't remember.<eos> No mother does, really.
Hell, I like you already.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on. Give me a number.<eos> Yo!<eos> Oh.<eos> - Oh, shit. - What?<eos> Fucking thief.<eos> He took my keys.<eos> - Wow, he played that smooth.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
And if you remember your training, you will.<eos> Good luck, Godspeed, and God bless Americ.<eos> USA!<eos> USA!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?<eos> No dice. Almost at level five.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I did.
This is as close as we g.<eos> You sure about this, son?<eos> Welcome, then.<eos> Sorry for your loss.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Give him one and show him how to use it.<eos> Hey, Berg, you gonna help us out or what?<eos> I'm almost at level five.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I did.
You know, we try to be better.<eos> Sometimes we kind of suck at it.<eos> But I look at you and you try so much harder than any human in my city.<eos> You're a good person, R.<eos> Anyway.<eos> It was me.<eos> What was you?<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I guess I kind of knew that.<eos> Y-you did?
Men like John Gale.<eos> Men like my father... who spent his whole life tilling the dirt... just to die facedown in it.<eos> I don't want that, Annie.<eos> I don't want to be a good man, I want to be a great one.<eos> I want to be Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison... all rolled into one.<eos> That's all I ever wanted for you, you know.<eos> Greatness.<eos> Then you understand.<eos> I do.<eos> But do you?
I'm your wizard.<eos> We're really gonna do this?<eos> How hard could it be to kill a wicked witch?<eos> Hard.<eos> Really hard.<eos> It's very, very hard to kill a wicked witch.<eos> And what about that poor girl back there?<eos> I think she really liked you.<eos> She'll get over me.<eos> They always do.
Sir Roland, your grandfather.<eos> The greatest knight, the Kingdom has ever known.<eos> Now, do you have that key your granny gave you?<eos> - The key, laddie!<eos> - Oh... Um... Yes.<eos> Where is the sword?<eos> What does this mean?<eos> It means that your quest is just beginning.<eos> - You know where it is, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Do the job, Emerson.<eos> I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.<eos> 'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves.<eos> 0-7-3.<eos> 4-5-5.<eos> 8-1-7.<eos> 6-9-0-1-0.<eos> Little last-minute broadcast come through.<eos> I'll inform the authorities.<eos> You do that.
Did you get mine?<eos> I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner.<eos> Spell-checks are usually pretty accurate. Right.<eos> I'm sure there's a whorehouse correspondents' dinner somewhere.<eos> Somewhere, yeah.<eos> I know, I know, I got it.<eos> No phones inside.<eos> Hey, if it were up to me, I couldn't care less.<eos> Gone.<eos> Done. Okay?
Take it easy, man.<eos> I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, come on, Razor.<eos> It's Dante Jr.<eos> Don't act like I didn't grow up to be a fine looking man. Right.<eos> Too bad your father didn't show up so I can belt him for taking what was left of my purses.<eos> Dad passed away last year.<eos> If you didn't see him dead, I wouldn't trust that.<eos> I did.
Are you going to go far?<eos> Wait!<eos> Will you give me a kiss goodnight ?<eos> My mom always gives me goodnight kiss ...<eos> Natascha 10 years has disappeared.<eos> Hundreds of police are investigating , since she disappeared the morning of March 2 .<eos> Despite the relentless pursuit the team has not been able to find anything.<eos> Natascha 's mother told reporters ,<eos> I lost all hope. How could you say that?<eos> I did not, Mom.
Of course.<eos> Excuse me ...<eos> I use it for construction . - Well ... What type of work do you do ?<eos> Telecommunications .<eos> I am a technician.<eos> And for whom do you work?<eos> Pardon?<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Siemens !<eos> Well , she did.
I hope so.<eos> I heard you did quite well in silicon valley.<eos> Yeah, I made a lot of money Off these two high-tech start companies...<eos> Nct software and mad solar. Good for you.<eos> Let's toast to that.<eos> Yes.<eos> To success.<eos> To success.<eos> Did you get a chance to read my script?<eos> Yeah, I did.
You know.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> Oh, baby, now I don't mean to get up in your business, but how did you not know?<eos> I mean, you don't...<eos> She doesn't...<eos> Yes, yes, I just...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know how I missed that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't either.
You've been coming home late, Virgil, smelling like seawater.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I swim with the Humpbacks.<eos> The nudist hippies?<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> They're not hippies.<eos> It's naturalism.<eos> It's something I do to help me relieve stress since the heart attack.<eos> It has nothing to do with sex.<eos> It doesn't?
I still can't make sense of it.<eos> - This is for Ricky.<eos> I put him in a canoe-<eos> - You are a lost cause, Sutter!<eos> - Cassidy, you can't be serious now.<eos> - We are done!<eos> We're done!<eos> To be honest, though, I wasn't that worried.<eos> We'd had our ups and downs, sure.<eos> But what great couple doesn't?
- No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I can't-<eos> - Say it.<eos> Mom, get off of my back.<eos> No.<eos> You gotta do the "motherfucking."<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - Do it.
- Did you hear me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sutter, I love you.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Sutter, I'm not wrong.<eos> - You don't love me.<eos> - Yes, I do!
And because of that, I can only keep one clerk.<eos> Now, I like you, Sutter... but more importantly, the customers like you... so I think you should be the one I keep.<eos> That's excellent.<eos> One second.<eos> I've given this some hard thought, and the only way I can let you stay... is if you promise me 100%... that you will never come in here loaded again.<eos> And I'm serious.<eos> Not even a light buzz.<eos> Because if you do, then I have to let you go.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
Could you take me back with you?<eos> - Gus-- - please?<eos> I don't think I can handle it out here on my own.<eos> Ah!<eos> Yeah,we'vebeen through all that. Just stay here, yeah?<eos> Enjoy the Zen.<eos> - Oh, come off it, man.<eos> - What, man? Oh, I could just have a home-cooked meal, you know, a proper lie-down, I'll come good.<eos> Hey, of course you will, man.<eos> Do it down here, away from all the other shit.
There were a lot of other girls there with problems. Could have been anyone.<eos> I got on with everyone.<eos> Did you have a girl named Mousey at your school?<eos> No... I don't think so.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> Miss Merrick, I know what you've been through.<eos> I know it must have been extremely painful.<eos> I really need your help.<eos> Do you have any specific memory of Anna you think I should know?<eos> Yeah... sure I do.
I really think he's gonna be okay without it.<eos> No, just wear it. So people don't have to worry about you.<eos> Yes, we're inviting ourselves.<eos> Accept it and move on.<eos> Peter does have to stay down below though.<eos> His eye throws off his equilibrium and he will get sick everywhere.<eos> No, I won't, Mom!<eos> Tell that to the bucket we have to bring!<eos> Mom, why do I have to wear this?<eos> Nobody else does.
And he didn't have no meth, either.<eos> So clearly, he ain't got no extra cash.<eos> Huh. Well, shit.<eos> Wait, he pawned the shotgun?<eos> How the fuck are we supposed to rob Stanley?<eos> I don't know, Randy.<eos> Fuck, man, why you gotta go and run Vernon over?<eos> I mean, shit, what makes you think he stole it in the first place?<eos> Lamar told me he took it.<eos> - Oh, Lamar did.
Vernon, I wasn't the motherfucker that ran you over.<eos> Fuck you, Raw Dog.<eos> You left me there.<eos> Hey, just calm the fuck down, Vernon.<eos> Look, I got a fucking arrow in me, man.<eos> And what the hell are you doing with my clown mask on?<eos> 'Cause it was the only fucking mask I could find, man.<eos> Easy now. Don't be pointing that shotgun in here.<eos> You know what's gonna happen if you shoot that thing off.<eos> Yeah, you damn right I do.
Do you think I would look at Mr Nicotra?<eos> Right, listen...<eos> Mr Nicotra, you're very nervous, and I understand thatwith the robbery.<eos> Tell me this. Do you have the keys to the supermarket? - Yes.<eos> Yes, one, but it's held by the board of the company.<eos> - You had your keys the whole time? - Yes. - How do you explain it, then?<eos> - What? That there's no sign of a break-in. How do I know?<eos> is it possible the thieves used the keys? - Yes. - Those of the board.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> . - What? You did, Mr Nicotra.
If I run into him in the street, I'll thump him.<eos> Forget it, Mimi. Apart from the bullshit and the insults, Ragonese told you want you wanted to know.<eos> You said you weren't convinced about the lack of forced entry and that using the keys was a big mistake.<eos> indirectly, Ragonese has told you the thief did it deliberately.<eos> He wanted to trap Nicotra and make him take the blame.<eos> That makes me feel worse. So he's notjust a dick but a bastard who's in bed with the Cuffaros. That's your opinion.<eos> Never mind. You're just in time.<eos> Find outwhat security firm the supermarket uses.<eos> Done it already. Done it already. Done it already.<eos> Done it already. Well? - None.
♪ Isn't it about time?<eos> ♪♪<eos> "OMFUG"?<eos> Other Music For Uplifting Gormandizers.<eos> Ah, yeah.<eos> Well, that explains it.<eos> Your mother called.<eos> She wants to know when you're paying her back.<eos> - Tell her we need a little time.<eos> - I did.
'Cause interest rates are north of 12% and heading to 18%.<eos> That's right, smarty pants.<eos> Fucking Jimmy Carter.<eos> Fucking Jimmy Carter.<eos> Well, fucking Nixon, really, and the war and the deficit and all of that shit, but...<eos> I fucking love you, you're so smart.<eos> You are.<eos> Thanks, kid, but how do you get them the money?<eos> Well...<eos> You don't, do you?
Under the sheik's name.<eos> Whose $2 million? Just listen.<eos> $2 million under the sheik's name in a Chase account that we control.<eos> Carmine calls up on the telephone, calls the bank and he sees that the sheik is real and he has a real account.<eos> Five days.<eos> I'm not taking $2 million of the taxpayers' money, putting it anywhere for five days. I don't care if we control it the whole time.<eos> Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country.<eos> Don't smother it, please. You know, Richard,<eos> I understand your eagerness.<eos> I really do.
We don't got a budget for that, Irving.<eos> You got to knock the mayor, the speaker of the State Assembly, you got to knock him off of his fucking feet, all right?<eos> He's got to feel like he's out of his league.<eos> What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country, all right?<eos> A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City, are you fucking kidding me'?<eos> That's gigantic, all right?<eos> And the mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check.<eos> And that's why this meeting isn't happening.<eos> Because to get millions, you need millions.<eos> We already did it.
I don't think so.<eos> We got them for wire fraud. It's over. You're done.<eos> You're both done.<eos> You're done. No, I don't think so.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You don't think so?<eos> Richard, you requested the two million.<eos> And you gave Brenda the account number.<eos> No, no.<eos> We didn't do any of that.
Clean.<eos> What?<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, no, you have to stay.<eos> We have guests.<eos> And we are a family unit.<eos> You didn't want a family.<eos> Neither did you!<eos> No, that's true.<eos> I really don't.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Are you okay? She...<eos> Gave me an ultimatum.<eos> Either the file goes or she goes, so she went.<eos> Wait a second. Uh... You're talking about a bunch of photos of old celebrities that you jerk off to and your girlfriend, and you picked the photos?<eos> Just because I'm keeping the file doesn't mean that I love her any less.<eos> - Why not just do whatever makes her happy? Or if you got to keep them, just lie to her and say you threw them out.<eos> It's not just about the stupid fucking pictures!<eos> I don't even -
A million dollars.<eos> Can you beat that?<eos> Let's raise a glass to Kate and Woody, here.<eos> To Kate and Woody!<eos> Not to be a spoilsport, but you all know this is bull.<eos> I mean, Dad didn't win anything.<eos> Nice try, Ross.<eos> Yeah, we're way beyond that.<eos> Ross is right.<eos> He didn't.
The one who helps you distinguish fact from fiction.<eos> WikiLeaks has hundreds of volunteers.<eos> It's very difficult to keep track of any single one.<eos> Well, do try to keep track of me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, what's this new leak you're sitting on?<eos> It must be big if it's piqued the interest of the CIA.<eos> So, you do believe me?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I didn't.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have to leave for a few days.<eos> Zada, you can take the reins from here?<eos> All right, give me a kiss.<eos> Can we go to the beach when you get back?<eos> MJ really wants to.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> No problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have to leave for a few days.<eos> Zada, you can take the reins from here?<eos> All right, give me a kiss.<eos> Can we go to the beach when you get back?<eos> MJ really wants to.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, she does.
Greg?<eos> We'll send your BlackBerry upstairs when we're done.<eos> Wait!<eos> They raided the house.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> The FBI raided the east house.<eos> Doc is probably on his way to jail.<eos> Not in vain if you wipe out the agents on that list.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> No, I didn't.
He says hello.<eos> That's very kind of him.<eos> Look how happy that makes her.<eos> That settles everything.<eos> He says hello to you.<eos> He'll marry her for the baby.<eos> Or I'll smash his face in!<eos> That won't help things!<eos> We're talking as if we were sure he'll come back and marry her.<eos> What if he doesn't?
That settles everything.<eos> He says hello to you.<eos> He'll marry her for the baby.<eos> Or I'll smash his face in!<eos> That won't help things!<eos> We're talking as if we were sure he'll come back and marry her.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You dare to think such things?<eos> And you don't?
- That's what he wrote to me.<eos> - You see.<eos> I'll need to think it over.<eos> If I left him the bar, along with what you have, that'll be two million.<eos> Fanny, just think, by the time he's 20, the boy could smoke cigars as thick as his arm!<eos> If it isn't a girl.<eos> A girl?<eos> What an idea! Shut up or you'll jinx us!<eos> No, I don't sing.<eos> - But someone does.
I'm not asking you to tell me her name.<eos> I know you'll refuse.<eos> But, tell me it isn't Escartefigue's wife.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> All right.<eos> So what do we do about Fanny?<eos> Let's wait.<eos> What if she accepts Panisse?<eos> She won't.<eos> What if she does?
I was just in line. And they were giving out massages. And a guy butt in front of me.<eos> He probably didn't butt.<eos> He barged right in front of me, and he said, "I need something in the shoulder."<eos> Were you in the right line?<eos> I was in the right line.<eos> Honey, you are almost never in the right line.<eos> Listen to me. It was unprofessional. It was poorly organized.<eos> You have this backwards.<eos> You go up there to be judged.<eos> You don't do the judging.
- What?<eos> - Yeah. What do you think?<eos> - Don't fight the impulse now, Lindsey.<eos> That's okay. No, thank you.<eos> - I really don't want to do that.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I think you do.<eos> - No, I don't.
I'm sorry I hit you.<eos> Bye, Ben.<eos> I'm going to make coffee!<eos> What about that guy you knew?<eos> The mob guy, Gina Pagano's cousin.<eos> It's a good idea. He got raptured, though.<eos> He did?<eos> I'm starting to think that maybe we should have just gone to church with our moms.<eos> Believed.<eos> Yeah, but if you don't, you don't.
Let's stay here and just have intercourse.<eos> And watch movies. I love intercourse. I love movies.<eos> Are you a Vin Diesel fan?<eos> I love Vin Diesel.<eos> I knew it!<eos> Fucking The Chronicles of Riddick, are you kidding me?<eos> It's the best.<eos> It's so underrated.<eos> See. You see?<eos> - I do.
Most of them are chasing a dead guy on a lawnmower.<eos> Okay, what does that mean?<eos> Wraiths, come to me.<eos> Fucking useless potheads.<eos> Just let her go, man.<eos> Or what?<eos> Or I will kick your evil ass.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Hey, I got a good one, too.<eos> How about you do like this to my booty-hole.
He doesn't have a pinched nose. What is that?<eos> - You sound exactly like that.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Give me that sweater.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> Just give me the fucking sweater!<eos> Because I'm fucking God.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> - Don't do it, baby.<eos> - Do it!
His plan was to get electrocuted in a Jacuzzi?<eos> Most of it didn't make a lot of sense to me, so it's possible.<eos> They shot at me!<eos> You fucking idiots!<eos> I should spank you both!<eos> Wow!<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed him.<eos> - I knew you could do it.<eos> - No, you didn't.
There's going to be a World War III.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> Stop being a dick, and get Daisy something to eat.<eos> I'm not a dick!<eos> I'm actually not that hungry.<eos> -Dick dick dick.<eos> All right, Jet, I'm doing it.<eos> We let you sleep in.<eos> Eddie said you needed to catch up on some rest.<eos> Did he?
Good day, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I, um, I got the information in here.<eos> May I ask why you're looking for Shaw?<eos> He took something of ours.<eos> We'd like to talk to him about it.<eos> Let's see what we've got.<eos> All right. What do you want?<eos> They say if someone's looking for a Russian gun, you're the man to see.<eos> Oh, they do, do they?
What? You didn't think one would recognize you?<eos> I've kept tabs on you, you know.<eos> You've been having a lot of fun out there.<eos> Good cop gone bad, Rio de Janeiro.<eos> It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?<eos> Too bad you didn't do it earlier, you could have worked for me.<eos> Like Letty Ortiz?<eos> So tell me something, because I buried her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You did?
It works.<eos> But you?<eos> You're loyal to a fault.<eos> Your code is about family.<eos> And that's great in the holidays, but it makes you predictable.<eos> And in our line of work, predictable means vulnerable.<eos> And that means I can reach out and break you whenever I want.<eos> At least when I go, I'll know what it's for.<eos> Well, at least you have a code.<eos> Most men don't.
Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to.<eos> So, what's our next adventure after this?<eos> How about we stay in one place?<eos> Where are you thinking?<eos> Tokyo.<eos> We always talk about Tokyo.<eos> Tokyo it is.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> How did you know that there would be a car there to break our fall?<eos> I didn't.
You got a package from Brazil.<eos> How exotic.<eos> Oh, who's Sonia?<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you know?<eos> No, it's just from my favorite store.<eos> I thought you were going to see David's mother.<eos> She's such a sweetheart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, so did he.
You also boast one of the lowest scores to ever come out of the Officers Training School.<eos> Well, you don't deny it, anyway.<eos> The real mystery is how you were never run out of the Navy altogether.<eos> And I'm sure you're going to tell us why.<eos> Pedigree, influence and advanced skills in bribing duty officers,<eos> - ship surgeons and political officers.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> So much shame, you tried to take your own life, but even at this you failed.<eos> But I'm sure you knew all that.<eos> No, actually I didn't.
-You know where it is now?<eos> -Maybe.<eos> Told her yet?<eos> -You wanna talk?<eos> -Yeah, it's about time.<eos> So... ... Simon... ... we'reallhere.<eos> Do you wanna talk us through it?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Good.<eos> Yeah, I really do. I...

Yes, I am a horse's ass.<eos> Yes, I will ogle, but never again, other than perhaps mentally, fondle another woman.<eos> And yes, I will embarrass you, and shock you, and often cause you to question every last reason in the world why you would ever love me in the first place.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You... - Yeah? - Think that I still love you?<eos> Really, you don't?

Phil, I don't know, I swear.<eos> I haven't talked to him in months.<eos> We gotta do it the hard way.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.<eos> You don't give me Chow, I blow his brains out.<eos> You go to the cops I blow his brains out.<eos> That's insane!<eos> We don't even know where the fuck he is!<eos> No one does.
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.<eos> You're not going back!<eos> Look, when this is over, we'll all go camping.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> And, meanwhile, make him comfy, all right?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Why?<eos> Pepe is sober.<eos> Do me a favor, okay?
What do you mean "no"?<eos> This was your idea.<eos> You want to get out of this, you better learn to take responsibility.<eos> Don't be a don't-er. You'll regret it.<eos> I already regret it.<eos> Get me the police.<eos> There is life after death.<eos> Of that, I am sure.<eos> But I'm also pretty sure dead people no longer need their stuff.<eos> And I did.
Everyone that wants the American dream.<eos> All I ever wanted out of life was what everyone else had.<eos> Not more.<eos> Just not the less I was used to.<eos> Well, I took a real swing for it, you know?<eos> And for a while, it was like I always thought it would be.<eos> I was one of you.<eos> And it felt good.<eos> People finally saw me like I saw myself and you can't ask for more than that.<eos> Maybe I did, though.
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness.<eos> But, after eternities of bloodshed my father Bor finally triumphed ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.<eos> What happened?<eos> He killed them all.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them, and yet here it is.<eos> The Dark Elves are dead.<eos> Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?<eos> No.<eos> It does not.
I say, who needs the outdoors when you ladies are such a breath of fresh air?<eos> Colonel, you really are a saucy monkey.<eos> Miss Erstwhile, what's that earthy smell about you?<eos> Is it perfume?<eos> I'm not wearing any perfume.<eos> Must be your essence.<eos> Colonel.<eos> Tremendous play.<eos> I didn't see that one.<eos> No, no one ever does.
The roads are narrow, so pass only on the turns.<eos> Weapons are inactive until mile marker 25.<eos> Lists, what's my top speed on this thing?<eos> 100 miles per hour, but you wanna keep it somewhere between 50 and 60.<eos> Forget everything you know about racing.<eos> Desert racing isn't about speed.<eos> It's about endurance and handling.<eos> Hang on a minute.<eos> I thought you didn't know shit about this kind of racing.<eos> I don't.
Don't worry, Mr Cortez.<eos> You haven't failed your mission yet.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Recuperating in my sumptuous healing pool right now.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> And as you can see, our friend Marcos Mendez is still very much alive and ticking.<eos> Which makes him still very much a threat.<eos> It needs to be disarmed.<eos> You don't know what you're dealing with.<eos> Well, actually, I do.
More than a little.<eos> She's beautiful!<eos> Listen, Fry, whatever it was that you and I had together...<eos> Goulash?<eos> No! Well, I don't know.<eos> Maybe it was goulash.<eos> But it can't really continue.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I want to spend my life with you.<eos> No, you don't.
Joyous day.<eos> Dark times is behind us.<eos> Clean living and prayer done lifted the plague!<eos> As thick and white as New England snow.<eos> Now, my niggers is returned to me.<eos> Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.<eos> Did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways?<eos> You won't stand idle, boy.<eos> Not on my land.<eos> Much work to do!
We know nothing of...<eos> Of what?<eos> Where has she gone? I don't know.<eos> She run off, ain't she?<eos> I don't know, Master.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I don't know, Master.<eos> You know, you know, you know!<eos> You know!<eos> No, I don't!
- l wasn't worried.<eos> - You didn't believe her?<eos> - l did at first.<eos> - You be careful!<eos> - l wasn't.<eos> - No.<eos> - l thought you were.<eos> I thought that... I wasn't worried, it was him!<eos> I thought you believed it at first.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Sorry I'm late, I was helping a colleague vomiting on your stairs.<eos> Who else is sick?<eos> My wife. This way.<eos> Careful as you go in. lt's round.<eos> - Have you been playing Duke Ellington?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You've had it, too?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> You know "Slap Happy"?<eos> You do.
I know it.<eos> You can't play charts like these without fudging a note here and there.<eos> So what?<eos> If you're going to start playing carefully, I'll just go get the wine and cheese.<eos> Do you want to be the thousandth guy to give me a respectable Bach?<eos> Because you can keep that.<eos> I don't need respectable.<eos> If you're going to play music this dense, you're going to hit a wrong note.<eos> And they won't know.<eos> They never do.
Not sure if you believe me or you saw how quiet I can be.<eos> And your lovely wife could've just slumped over and fallen asleep, she was so goddamned bored.<eos> Isn't it amazing what you can get away with in a crowded theater when all eyes are on the stage?<eos> Sit down or I really will shoot her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Isn't this what you wanted?<eos> You said yourself she was a muddler.<eos> Muddling your whole life, it seems.<eos> - You don't know anything.<eos> - But I do, Tom.
You think this is some kind of a game?<eos> I'll rip your throat out, goddamn it.<eos> You sniveling little piece of shit!<eos> Are you listening to me, Tom?<eos> You knew that was the wrong note.<eos> You knew it!<eos> Yes.<eos> But the audience didn't.<eos> What the hell do you mean?<eos> They never do.
It's mine, after all. From my robe.<eos> He had cut it.<eos> You see?<eos> The belt, that is.<eos> - I went out that night, and saw it hanging.<eos> - Who was hanging?<eos> Not who. But what.<eos> The belt was hanging.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> God, it's like, "Go away," right?<eos> So have you talked to Dena lately?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> - I haven't seen her in a while.<eos> - Yeah. I heard she was kind of down or something.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> That's what Sarah said.<eos> Mm-hmm. I just... I thought you would know something.<eos> I don't.
Please!<eos> You never did take the Paxil, did you?<eos> No.<eos> Or the Zoloft.<eos> No.<eos> Only the Ablixa.<eos> Didn't really do anything for me.<eos> So, when did she start paying you?<eos> She always knew you'd turn on her someday<eos> like you did with Martin.
Look at me, you will be ok.<eos> This is water, drink up.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> What's the hell going on?<eos> Do you people know each other?<eos> You just need to breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hey, who are you, man?<eos> I don't remember who I am.<eos> None of us do.
You have no craving for it.<eos> Kris I just got a call.<eos> It's your mother.<eos> She says she's been taken by several men.<eos> Oh no.<eos> She says they won't let her go unless you pay them.<eos> No...<eos> Oh no.<eos> Do you have any money?<eos> No I don't.
The place where you and your family you'd go on vacation in Vermont?<eos> You drive Kris.<eos> What road would you take?<eos> I would have to get a map.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> It's just some country road.<eos> I was six.<eos> No I was six.<eos> I told you that story.<eos> No you didn't, no.
Yeah?<eos> I sold the stones.<eos> I'll have your money by tonight.<eos> - When?<eos> - 9:00.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Camden.<eos> So you think he's up to it?<eos> - He wants to be.<eos> - Don't they all.
Thanks boys for cleaning up. Very nice...<eos> - No worries. - No worries.<eos> Well?<eos> I've been offered a job.<eos> Senior lecturer in drama at Sidney University.<eos> Sidney?<eos> It's a great department.<eos> It's quite a salary hike.<eos> Sounds like you want to take it.<eos> Yes, I do. Of course I do.
It's not as simple as that, Harold.<eos> Yeah, agreed but for Tom?<eos> And what he wants to do... This isn't the place.<eos> He's bound to take some time to organized, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But... The point is that I need a wife...<eos> Permanent wife.<eos> You've got one, Harold.<eos> I'm up for 20 years now, you know.<eos> I do.
Yeah, if he's home.<eos> Detective Robin Griffin.<eos> Southern Lakes police.<eos> So?<eos> I'm wanting to chat with Tui, if I may?<eos> You could if she was here.<eos> Is she at school?<eos> I doubt she's at school. No.<eos> Do you mind if I come in and look around?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay.<eos> I hope you're ready, 'cause matt's gonna love this.<eos> Let's go.<eos> " life is a rollercoaster<eos> " just gotta ride it<eos> " I need you... "<eos> You okay in there?<eos> Yeah, look, I'll take care of Matt.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> You just do the searching, okay?
Al, I'm going to pull a car over.<eos> Speak to you tomorrow.<eos> Licence, please.<eos> Hi, simone.<eos> -Where are you all off to?<eos> -Book club.<eos> - What you reading?<eos> - Blue velvet.<eos> -Thought it was a film.<eos> -We're doing the book version.
But you won't leave here alive", wasn't it?<eos> "I will cut you into pieces and parcel it"<eos> Ya?<eos> I will fight now. I will fight with you.<eos> I will fight with each of your men.<eos> Fight everyone!<eos> Fight the entire Village if I have to.<eos> only for Meena.<eos> Because I love her.<eos> I do.
- Jean-Claude Pistou, my interpreter.<eos> - No, it's Vladimir Karpov.<eos> Careful.<eos> He is partying.<eos> We held a big party with Stalin.<eos> Shut up with vodka, we drank.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You know very well who I am.<eos> Vladimir had played masquerade for several years with this minister.<eos> So did the French talkative.
You have no idea who I am, have you?<eos> I know your name.<eos> It isn't Cole.<eos> It's Litchfield.<eos> Matthew Litchfield. Yes.<eos> He was my father.<eos> A wicked man, Captain Hastings.<eos> He was our jailer until my sister Margaret...<eos> Yes, I know. It was in all the papers.<eos> But you don't.
OK, I'm sorry.<eos> Er...<eos> I went home.<eos> I didn't see any of the other girls.<eos> I had sardines on toast.<eos> And then I went to bed.<eos> So nobody can corroborate your story.<eos> I guess not.<eos> It is strange that Dr Willoughby also has no alibi for the night in question.<eos> He doesn't?
Young people today, they rush into things!<eos> But it's important to know the background, don't you think?<eos> The psychological background.<eos> Well, there are certain... risks that one might not wish to take.<eos> But the persons taking these risks are Celia and Desmond, not you, madame.<eos> 399 your pardon?<eos> Desmond, he is not your son by birth.<eos> What's that got to do with anything?<eos> When he was young, did you take care of him?<eos> Of course I did!
And after a few months with that beloved nanny, I could do nothing with him!<eos> She's a...<eos> She's a devious little baggage!<eos> And I made jolly sure to intercept her letters later on.<eos> He's my son and I will say what happens to him!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen! Five minutes till the start of the recital!<eos> - Mademoiselle Celia.<eos> - Poirot.<eos> Mademoiselle, do you know, and please to forgive me, how it was that Aunt Dorothea died?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Perhaps you met him through your late husband and his work?<eos> Stephen rarely thought to include me in his work, monsieur.<eos> I'm sorry I can't be any more help to you.<eos> We do not wish to distress you, madame.<eos> I loved my husband, monsieur.<eos> But I realised some time ago that my affection was no longer reciprocated.<eos> Last night I learned for certain what I had suspected for some time, that he...<eos> ..that he...<eos> That he and Madame Olivier were conducting the love affair?<eos> How did you...?
And with his newfound wealth,<eos> Michael was not only able to send his son off<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - to a bright future in college, with the family car he was also able to finish the long-delayed housing development Sudden Valley, but this time, under his own company name.<eos> Maybe I can give you a tip.<eos> Might want to put a road up to this place.<eos> Well, we paved the neighborhood. Just waiting for the city to build a road to it.<eos> And although his mother's day in court was something both he and his college-bound son would miss,<eos> Michael truly felt that nothing could go wrong.<eos> And then something did.
Oh, gee.<eos> I think it's a lot more fun if we see her die.<eos> - That is fun.<eos> - And by the way, then it's a fantastic part for a leading lady.<eos> In fact, my girl Rebel would be great in that part.<eos> Your girl?<eos> Rebel Alley.<eos> She's an actress.<eos> You know her.<eos> He didn't.

Why don't you just go change into something a little less... unflattering, and... I'll, uh...<eos> And he was getting everyone in the mood for romance.<eos> Guess I'll take my clothes off.<eos> While Ann less-unflattered herself up,<eos> Gob had an unexpected visitor--<eos> Ann's ex-boyfriend George Michael, who, as it turned out, hadn't completely let go of the relationship.<eos> You're lucky that I'm chasing after our girlfriend, or I'd have to flatten you!<eos> Whew! Way to plant, Ann.<eos> You told me George Michael knew about us.<eos> Well, he does now, my darling plant.
I see that now.<eos> You can succeed. You will be a star.<eos> You have to take me.<eos> I'm your twin brother.<eos> I love you, Dee.<eos> Dennis... suck my dick.<eos> (Dennis grunting) Wait.<eos> Dee!<eos> No, wait, Dee, wait!<eos> Don't do this, Dee!
Sorry.<eos> I don't do well with small spaces.<eos> You been here long?<eos> When I was a kid and I was acting up, my mother used to tease me and she used to threaten me saying she'd send me to Hecuba Prison.<eos> Now I'm here, and she won't even open my letters.<eos> Well, I barely know my mom.<eos> Though this one time she did sleep with my boyfriend, then try to kill me.<eos> Don't you have any kin waiting for you on the outside?<eos> I've got friends that are more than family.<eos> At least I did ...
Milk in first, please.<eos> Then the tea.<eos> And a spoonful of sugar.<eos> You don't intend for this film to be a musical?<eos> I absolutely do.<eos> No.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> Mr. Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.<eos> Yes, she does.
What?<eos> That's right. Yeah.<eos> So what?<eos> I sent the text.<eos> If I didn't, you'd be dead and you'd be off joining the coast guard or saving some stupid whales.<eos> You want to be a hero, Jack?<eos> You do that at home.<eos> I would love nothing more.<eos> Now, dad, I know you might have a few reservations about me running Mr. Jiffy Fix.<eos> Okay, you do.
Well, professionals don't wear shorts on a job, so tuck in to make up for it.<eos> I opt out of that rule.<eos> Just tuck your damn shirt in.<eos> I'm ticklish.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Mr. Jiffy Fix.<eos> Where's Tony?<eos> I wanted Tony.<eos> We all do.
Confiscated!<eos> I also locked up Jack's clothes, so now you'll be forced to stay home and rest like the doctor said.<eos> I laid out an outfit of mine you can wear.<eos> Ellis sees this, he's gonna pee himself.<eos> He does that no matter what you're wearing.<eos> What the hell is that smell?<eos> Oh, patchouli oil.<eos> The hippie people wear it, and now I am a huge fan.<eos> I like it!<eos> No, you don't.
You gotta work with the man you're given.<eos> Okay.<eos> So that's the chorus.<eos> Now you do your solo.<eos> We got a band!<eos> I think Margaret is looking down on you very proud that you're taking care of your health and, just as important, that you've finally told your son that you loved him.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Hmm?<eos> No, I didn't.
I never knew what to do about her mood swings.<eos> It's not easy being a parent.<eos> Nobody gets it right.<eos> Nobody.<eos> She had a breakdown.<eos> A couple of years ago.<eos> It was over some man.<eos> Somebody she was at work with.<eos> I thought she was on the mend.<eos> I really did.
Some of them are actually taking pictures.<eos> And they're all waiting for me to cry or freak out.<eos> I'm like something in a zoo.<eos> And I'M the one who gets sent out, because, apparently, I'M causing a distraction.<eos> The same thing happened to me when my mum died.<eos> Tragedy sticks to you.<eos> It makes people stare, it makes your friends avoid you.<eos> And you can never shake it off.<eos> I don't even feel like I live in the same world as them now.<eos> You don't.
I'm afraid I have to insist.<eos> Would you excuse us for a minute?<eos> How's your heart?<eos> Same.<eos> But you're drinking too much.<eos> Have you heard from him?<eos> Yeah. A week ago, this came for me.<eos> I thought you should see it.<eos> How does he know?<eos> He doesn't.
Little fuckin' prick!<eos> Dad, he's nothing.<eos> He took me around to see the sights last night.<eos> Something that you've never done, by the way.<eos> Chaitanya, stay focused.<eos> This man is your enemy.<eos> Keep him close, but don't forget that.<eos> Remember Donnie Brasco.<eos> Do you want to win?<eos> Do you?
Yes, yes, I am.<eos> Oh, oh. Might you be in the market for new representation, Atticus?<eos> Dude, you're a Hollywood Agent-- a wanker in a suit.<eos> What the fuck would you know about managing rock bands?<eos> Hey, hey, don't judge the wanker by the suit.<eos> This dude, however bald and pasty-- as rock and roll as they come.<eos> And loves to pound the pussy.<eos> This is true.<eos> I love to pound the pussy.<eos> He does.
- Give or take a couple of 'em.<eos> Of a million? !<eos> Hey, whoa whoa whoa. Watch out.<eos> There's a camera right there.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so after they're done upstairs we drop it in here, it piles up until it's full.<eos> Half the time the drivers don't even bring it upstairs first.<eos> So how do they know how much is in there?<eos> They don't.
The Empire heist in the Bronx?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And you're here looking?<eos> I thought the papers said that was the Guineas.<eos> - You know, the real mob. - Ah, you know.<eos> Big-time lowlifes, small-time lowlifes... it's all the same to me.<eos> Ain't that right there, Michael... Dimitriu?<eos> Did I say that right?<eos> You come into my place and you start saying people's names, - but you never said your name.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - We didn't.
They're small time criminals, but I wanted to know if you knew them.<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> - I was just checking, that's all.<eos> I mean I haven't spoken to them in a while, you know, if...<eos> SO... you know, I'm sure they had nothing to do with this - if that's what you're saying.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> But okay.<eos> Okay, so, you have any more questions or is that it?<eos> You said that there was only one guy, right, - ...who broke in, the robber?<eos> - No no, I didn't.
Give me a reason.<eos> Give me one reason.<eos> OK.<eos> Where do we find the money to pay for these fakes?<eos> It cost Guy ten grand to fake one.<eos> These fakes would have to stand up to carbon dating and expert scrutiny shit.<eos> Ten grand a book, that's a hundred grand.<eos> I can front it.<eos> You got a 100 grand laying around, Nicky?<eos> Yes, I do.
Domenic Calhoun, we've received information giving us probable cause for a search.<eos> Look who we have here.<eos> Georges Seurat.<eos> "Model, Rear-View," 1887.<eos> Pointillist phase.<eos> This is so beautiful.<eos> I love all the little dots.<eos> It's very artistic.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I do.
Thank you...<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> I'm sorry too!<eos> But you shouldn't shout at me like that!<eos> I'm not shouting!<eos> I didn't shout!<eos> You called me a bitch...<eos> - I didn't say bitch!<eos> Yes, you did...<eos> - You did!
More than anything.<eos> But maybe it would be better to wait.<eos> I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.<eos> Not just for me, but for you.<eos> You've been so kind.<eos> I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.<eos> I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.<eos> I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.<eos> Your true friend.<eos> I do, Lord Baelish.
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.<eos> Take it, Hodor.<eos> And the archer.<eos> I got lucky with one of them.<eos> There are more.<eos> Many more.<eos> And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.<eos> I wish you'd come with us.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I really do.
And now I've burned everything down.<eos> Not everything, my lord.<eos> She's up here.<eos> - Yara.<eos> - Shh.<eos> Wait.<eos> I brought him back.<eos> He killed the others.<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't.
If only the Master of Coin had such power.<eos> If only.<eos> I owe you a significant debt.<eos> Our redheaded friend.<eos> You secured her release when the queen detained her.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Of course.<eos> A simple misunderstanding.<eos> Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.<eos> We don't.
Our redheaded friend.<eos> You secured her release when the queen detained her.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Of course.<eos> A simple misunderstanding.<eos> Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.<eos> We don't.<eos> I did fuck her once.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But we don't.
About a week, I think.<eos> You think?<eos> You don't know?<eos> When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.<eos> You and your roads.<eos> Is that how you lot do your fighting?<eos> You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?<eos> Most of the time, yes.<eos> How do the men holding the banners fight?<eos> They don't, really.
"to never speak<eos> "of this enterprise to any adult,<eos> "and to never betray its location<eos> "or its participants,<eos> "and from this day forthwith<eos> "to boil our own water,<eos> "kill our own food, build our own shelter and be our own men."<eos> All right, we need cool names for everything.<eos> Like, awesome, mythical names.<eos> - No, we don't.
- That's powerful stuff.<eos> - That's not...<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?<eos> We're under a lot of stress, Captain.<eos> I'm sorry about...<eos> You know Patrick was our only boy.<eos> - "Is."<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I was wrong.<eos> I would never do that again.<eos> Joe.<eos> I...<eos> I, um, got this for you from the gift shop.<eos> Uh, it has an eagle on it, the snake's natural enemy.<eos> "You're miles above the rest."<eos> I... I guess they didn't have one that said, uh,<eos> "You saved me from an agonizing death by rapid blood oxygenation."<eos> Uh, they did; just no envelopes.
Yeah, that works better, thanks.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That's ok.<eos> That was hard, huh?<eos> You wanna stay later and work on it together?<eos> You wanna try that again?<eos> From here?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Come on, you like it.<eos> No, I don't.
What's that to me?<eos> Barbu, this is no joke.<eos> You're so good with arrangements.<eos> Why don't you arrange it?<eos> - Can't you deal with it?<eos> - No, Relu.<eos> You don't know how patronizing he was.<eos> I can't meet him in the state I'm in.<eos> He's an asshole.<eos> To do what?
The red gate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still, it's a better-looking house.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's the last thing I ask of you.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> Don't leave me alone.<eos> Come in with me.<eos> I don't know what to tell these people.<eos> And I do?
congratulations, Sophie.<eos> I've just slipped through the cracks!<eos> - Hey, girlfriend.<eos> - Hey, girlfriend.<eos> If you're looking for Nikki, she's not here.<eos> Oh, I've just came to drop off these letters of recomendation<eos> For Sophie and MacKenzie.<eos> - Oh!<eos> you wrote those?<eos> - Sure did.
Hey, Deanna.<eos> I'm here to fix the gate.<eos> Oh, wonderful!<eos> My gate is in need of some fixing!<eos> Right.<eos> That's what I've just said, I'm here to fix the gate.<eos> Lets not worry so much about that.<eos> There is a lot of things in this house that need attention.<eos> - You know what I'm saying?<eos> - No I do not.
Honey, this is Tommy Cavanaugh.<eos> He was my old steroid that I grew up with.<eos> This is my...<eos> Wife, Roxanne.<eos> Why are your hands shaking, Daddy?<eos> My hands are shaking?<eos> Probably because I had too much coffee this morning, sweetheart.<eos> I heard you been running around saying you could take me in a fight.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did, this morning in Kmart.
That's not something I do very well.<eos> I mean, in order to become a Catholic.<eos> Then you could confess, and... you would be forgiven for your sins.<eos> What if they're unforgivable?<eos> Nothing is unforgivable.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I haven't killed anybody, but, mm, I've been pretty bad.<eos> Look, we have people here waiting to go to confession, so I'm sorry.<eos> Well, they can wait.<eos> I did.
I know you think my world is naive.<eos> Is that so bad... to have hope?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't advise you.<eos> I know.<eos> You should be careful what you wish for, angel.<eos> You might not get it.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes, I do.
With the truth.<eos> I'd like to hear it.<eos> I'd tell them that I never even met this kid, that I got him out of jail on a speeding charge.<eos> Okay, how did he happen to hire you?<eos> He didn't. I got him out of jail as a favor to his mother.<eos> How do you happen to know the mother?<eos> I was appointed by the court to represent her in an appeal in a capital murder case.<eos> Do you know what her son did for a living?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you do now.
So I called up the sheriff there and I asked him, had they found any dead bodies along the side of the highway?<eos> And he said that they did.<eos> And I said, "Thank you," and I hung up.<eos> I know you think I'm kidding.<eos> But I'm not.<eos> And I'm not out.<eos> That's right. And I'm not kidding about that, either.<eos> Really?<eos> No. I know where the truck is going.<eos> I always did.
Oh, my God.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm go...<eos> Except for the fair Lisa...<eos> You will live and be my bride.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Can't you just kill me, too?<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I really mean it, Phil.<eos> Just do it.
That's a lock for Hagrid.<eos> Best Man?<eos> Damn.<eos> Best Man.<eos> Now.<eos> No, this is so hard.<eos> It's lose-lose you know.<eos> You piss off all the ones you don't pick, and you end up hating the one you do pick because he makes a bad speech and ruins the day.<eos> Do you wanna see these puppies or not?<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't see how that changes anything.<eos> I'm stunned you should ask ME, Stanley, truly stunned.<eos> But I am asking you, because I know, in a way, you will understand, and want to do something.<eos> Just for two days?<eos> We use your house, you could say you knew nothing about it, after all I've been to the house, I could have suggested it to Louis - there's the stable block.<eos> There was a knifing in the hotel and a girl died.<eos> Louis is a very intelligent man, of course, but we must not be blinded.<eos> This was always the likely outcome, a negro band in this hotel, a fight, a stabbing.<eos> Do you really believe that, Lavinia?<eos> Yes, I do.
It'll be easier on my own.<eos> Ma'am. Maybe.<eos> Or maybe you're less easy to spot when you're being a servant, Louis.<eos> There you are!<eos> Mr Luscombe, what a surprise!<eos> I've been saying goodbyes all over town, and of course one of my first had to be you, Carla.<eos> It's been such a terrible day, hasn't it?<eos> With all those awful things in the papers about Louis, it's not possible, it's just not possible he did anything to Jessie!<eos> I know he can't have!<eos> Course he didn't.
I wonder what it is.<eos> Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara?<eos> That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing it sees?<eos> Nonsense, of course.<eos> Unless the chemical composition of the body has been massively corrupted.<eos> Wow. This is nasty.<eos> An organic poison.<eos> A sort of venom.<eos> And you think it's connected to Sweetville?<eos> I do.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, in Olympia tradition,<eos> Kai Greene, Phil Heath, center stage, please.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we had a one-point decision.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the next name I announce will be the winner of the 2012 Mr. Olympia!<eos> Come on, baby!<eos> When I did find myself in institutional placement, the cold, oppressive feeling of, like...<eos> Like you don't matter and you may never, ever, ever matter again.<eos> I began to talk about competing in the Olympia one day.<eos> I really did not develop Plan B.<eos> But I didn't, I didn't.
No, Jared. That's your room now.<eos> Yeah, but it's not like he went off to college.<eos> Jared, Daniel wanted you to have his room.<eos> He told you that?<eos> Yes, a long time ago.<eos> It made him very happy to know you were in there.<eos> He didn't hardly say anything tonight.<eos> Well, he doesn't know how to, honey.<eos> I kinda don't, either.<eos> Nobody does.
I think it looks great, and I don't think you're incompetent.<eos> I mean, you're competent. Come on.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> This whole time I was working here, I thought I had some power.<eos> I thought I was somebody.<eos> I don't have shit.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You still have power.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm sorry I didn't stay away from her after you told me to.<eos> Told you to?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You told Jimmy to stay away from me?<eos> Again, that is not what I said.<eos> Yeah, it kind of is.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - I'm not your property.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
It's her.<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you read the playbill?<eos> She's been knocking around the ensemble for years.<eos> Shall we get a cab?<eos> Taxi!<eos> Hey.<eos> Adam, right?<eos> You came?<eos> I did.
I'll talk to my partners.<eos> If the reviews are as good as I expect, you'll be back on Broadway next season.<eos> Hit it.<eos> "Have the grace of her predecessor."<eos> "A career chorus girl."<eos> "Can she even dance?"<eos> Why are you reading message boards?<eos> I'm preparing myself.<eos> I need to know what people are gonna be saying about me.<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, I'll let you be.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've actually been thinking about you a lot lately...<eos> Because I can't stop comparing myself to you.<eos> All of those reviewers loved you in Boston.<eos> Well, they're gonna love you too.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I have to go back in.<eos> Don't leave, all right?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We already did, and it didn't matter.<eos> Karen, you don't understand.<eos> No, I do understand.<eos> Actually, I finally do.
You're really, really bad too.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your choices are all wrong.<eos> The set is ridiculous, and the one thing...<eos> The one thing that I was holding onto, my song, you cut.<eos> And why?<eos> So that you can dance around in your underwear on stage a little while longer?<eos> Nobody wants to see that.<eos> - Some people do.
Where do I stand?<eos> Right behind me.<eos> That looks cool.<eos> Wait till you see what the guys at anti gravity put together.<eos> If we pull this off, we should raise quite a few eyebrows tonight.<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> Scott's showing him around.<eos> He thinks I made a mistake, leaving Bombshell.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> We both did.
Okay, Richard Francis is gonna be at our stumble-through at 6:00.<eos> So I want as much of this new material in the run as possible.<eos> Ana, do you want to get over there so we can hear the new songs, please?<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Wow. Really?<eos> You liked it that much?<eos> Oh, not just us.<eos> Everybody did.
Hi.<eos> What did you think?<eos> You want to know what I think?<eos> I think you're angry at me and Jimmy, and you're taking it out on the show.<eos> Did you give me Marilyn because of my talent or because you wanted to sleep with me?<eos> Your talent.<eos> Too fast.<eos> After this show is over, I don't think we should work together again.<eos> Yeah, there's something you should know about Jimmy.<eos> Not from you, I don't.
And the New York Times fact checker said that Jimmy Collins isn't even his real name.<eos> So he changed his name.<eos> Actors do it all the time. Yeah, but they don't do it 'cause they've got something to hide, do they?<eos> I lent him money last week...<eos> A lot of it...<eos> For a drug debt.<eos> This is childish, even from you.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> You don't know what you're dealing with.<eos> Yes, I do.
He better.<eos> I'm not encouraged.<eos> [Exhales] What a vile human being.<eos> I feel filthy just talking to him.<eos> How long till we're rid of him?<eos> Katie and I are going to go see the lawyers later today.<eos> What do I do if Jerry fires tom before you get back?<eos> Tom needs Karen to respect him.<eos> If Karen respects him, everyone else will.<eos> And if she doesn't?
Stop trying to be so provocative.<eos> Since you've left, he's incorporated a lot of my version.<eos> Not Marilyn's mother, though.<eos> I have my spies.<eos> I know how much you wanted her in.<eos> You chose to leave.<eos> Yeah, well, they left me no other option, okay?<eos> Stop playing games, okay?<eos> If you want to come back, just say that.<eos> But if you don't...
There's gotta be something in one of these...<eos> Some union rule he broke, someone he forgot to pay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Press clippings from carousel.<eos> [Laughs] That was the first show I did with your dad.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> He saved a picture of the two of you in front of the marquee.<eos> Oh.<eos> You really loved him, didn't you?<eos> Of course I did.
It's based on The Great Gatsby, and its writer is going to win a Tony for it someday.<eos> Scott...<eos> I can't stop thinking about it.<eos> I mean, it's not just an adaptation.<eos> It stands on its own.<eos> If you keep this up, people are gonna be doing your version for years to come.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Tom doesn't want to let go of Gatsby.<eos> He wants to do it with me.<eos> Of course he does.
It's the catacombs under Paris.<eos> Yes, your second problem.<eos> They're notoriously difficult to navigate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, generations of naive tourists, crypt raiders, and drunken university Students got lost down there, permanently.<eos> We don't have time to get lost.<eos> Time is running out.<eos> For the... research that we're doing.<eos> Pete, we have baudin's map.<eos> - You do?

All this stuff that Charlotte has...<eos> All these antiques that are hundreds and hundreds of years old...<eos> This is yours, and you just, what, want 'em back?<eos> Exactly, and your legend.<eos> I'm not selfish.<eos> I merely thought while we were here, I might as well Nick an old memento or two.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Coincidently, all the gold ones, right, chap?<eos> We didn't find the legend.<eos> You didn't.
So I'm not just your mole, but your whore?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What other word is there for it?<eos> Agent provocateur.<eos> OK, worst case scenario, the PM boots you out.<eos> You've put down a marker, Freya.<eos> As someone of principle, someone worthy of holding high office.<eos> Haven't you earned this chance? Hmm?<eos> I know, it's asking a lot.<eos> Of course I do.
You know why she made that rule?<eos> It's to free up your brain to think about other things.<eos> Because if you focus on just one thing all the time, your brain gets stuck on it.<eos> That's how it turns into an obsession.<eos> So shall we talk about something else?<eos> You choose.<eos> Any subject you want.<eos> Anything you like, it's up to you.<eos> * Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby<eos> * Do you, do you, do you, do you
They want what you have.<eos> Life.<eos> But they have no power over you.<eos> All you have to do is ignore them, and they will go away.<eos> See, I told you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> That's the song that's been playing.<eos> What song? What are you talking about?<eos> You don't know that song?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey.<eos> - How are you? - Good.<eos> Good. How you been?<eos> - How did you get my Facebook?<eos> - Oh. Getting right to it. - Yeah.<eos> - I just looked up your name.<eos> - I didn't tell you my name.<eos> - Obviously you did, 'cause I looked it up.<eos> - No, I definitely did not tell you my name.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
To not call you a kid? You're a fucking kid.<eos> - Jon!<eos> - Fuck You!<eos> - Fuck me?<eos> Did you just say fuck me to me?<eos> - Jon! He said they're in love, they're in love.<eos> It doesn't matter how old they are. He's older than you were when we got married.<eos> You know that? For God's sake, he's your son!<eos> You love this girl?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Jon.<eos> - I hope I'm not bothering you.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> I just wanted to apologize.<eos> I don't know if you remember, you caught me in a kind of an inopportune moment last week.<eos> - When I was sobbing by the door?<eos> - Oh! Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry about that.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please, don't you apologize.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
The point is, we all have to die.<eos> It's the natural order of things.<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> We don't have to die.<eos> Seriously, don't mess with Sally, 'cause she's very serious about the whole balance of the universe thing.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Like kill-you-in-the-face serious.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
I think he blamed me for that.<eos> No, no he wouldn't do that.<eos> It's OK, I'd feel the same way.<eos> She, um... Did she say anything?<eos> Faith.<eos> Play your song.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Ma'am, ma'am! Full fluids!<eos> I never knew what that meant.<eos> I do.
A plea is admitting wrongdoing.<eos> That taints my father, my brother, and any future Carraday that follows.<eos> Including your future grandchildren.<eos> So you're willing to abandon my daughter to protect your family name.<eos> - I'm doing the right thing here.<eos> Most of the wrong done in this world has been done by people who thought they were doing the right thing.<eos> You a religious man, Luke?<eos> I believe in God, sure.<eos> You think that God can redeem a man if that man will let him?<eos> I do, sure.
So be there, okay?<eos> Case I need a quick getaway.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are friends for?<eos> Little Bamber's got a baby four months old.<eos> Husband overseas, never seen it.<eos> She leaves it at the Sally Ann.<eos> They look after children there now.<eos> Well I guess somebody has to.<eos> Mothers doing war-jobs.
Come on, bro, fist me.<eos> That's definitely not right.<eos> You're a manager?<eos> How old are you?<eos> I'm 23.<eos> But no worries, fellas, I'm an old soul.<eos> Well, the thing about that is, we don't have a team.<eos> We have two... me and Nick.<eos> We don't have the rest of our team.<eos> We didn't...
We either step up or we get crushed.<eos> - Silly man.<eos> Stop showing off. - Right.<eos> Let's pick up the replica necklace, back to the hotel, cocktails and supper.<eos> Yee-ha!<eos> Ride 'em, cowboy.<eos> Jerry, how on earth did you know where to find someone who could make a replica necklace? Well, you know...<eos> I have my contacts.<eos> Contacts?<eos> No, Jerry we don't.
- Apart from our dignity?<eos> Either way, it's worth investigating.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Let's investigate.<eos> Would you see that the relevant people get this?<eos> It would be an honour, my friend.<eos> I've, er... taken a bit out.<eos> You can stash the rest under the mattress.<eos> Don't worry, old pal. We've got a safe house built under the stairs.<eos> - We do?
Yes?<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> No! This?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> - Kate, you did it.<eos> You did it! - I did it!<eos> - You bought us a boat!<eos> - I did it!
[Muffled] No, it's not.<eos> This is really serious.<eos> It's so serious.<eos> It's very, very serious.<eos> I have to get-- All:<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, yes, I will.<eos> O'Hara, get on the phone and call the paramedics.<eos> I don't suppose you saw who shot you?<eos> I did, yes.
You do.<eos> We laid right there on that bed a month ago and you told me if you ever broke up with me that I shouldn't let you.<eos> Because you were just being crazy.<eos> And how every guy you ever loved was gay.<eos> And how I was the only one that made you feel anything.<eos> Don't get up, Adam.<eos> Don't get up.<eos> And you said that I made you feel like your whole body was a clit.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.

Nobody stole them from her.<eos> And the coins...<eos> Who knows?<eos> It's typical of you.<eos> He copied it from you.<eos> And the sword, the letter-opener?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We couldn't find it.<eos> The kid didn't have it.<eos> He did.
I wouldn't know.<eos> And leave Bennet alone.<eos> He's all right.<eos> He's just so goddamn serious.<eos> Why don't you take me to the theatre?<eos> You think I need a bunch of fake people selling me fake feelings?<eos> I live in a goddamn whorehouse.<eos> Since you mention it, no more free ones, house rules.<eos> Hmmm, but I have a tab with the house.<eos> I do!
An elegant weapon indeed, Inspector.<eos> Some of our finest marksmen do still favour the Whitworth.<eos> Who?<eos> Our membership is confidential, sir.<eos> I fear it behoves my custodial duty to ask what this enquiry portends.<eos> We pulled a Whitworth bullet from the brains of a horse whose carriage had been burglarised by armed men.<eos> Now, is your custodial duty sufficiently fulfilled to oblige me in mine?<eos> Far be it from me to interfere with your police work, but may I suggest you commence your enquiries with a Mr George Doggett?<eos> Says he won the Queen's Prize.<eos> Our highest award, indeed he did.
I don't know how her mother lets her live on her own.<eos> She's run away several times from the psychiatric hospital!<eos> But you saw the mother.<eos> She's more worried about what's happening to Dior... than about her daughter.<eos> Mr. Galán didn't want to leave her on her own, but...<eos> Mr. Galán!<eos> Yes, the actor, Ricardo Galán.<eos> He was her boyfriend.<eos> They broke up months ago. He didn't come here anymore.<eos> Well, he did.
Sorry... Night? We have talked about it.<eos> It's not going to work. I change my mind not whatever you say.<eos> - I'm not here to talk to you. - What then?<eos> - I'm not here to talk to you. - What does that mean?<eos> Him! Really?<eos> And you...<eos> Her?<eos> Of course! In a perfect match.<eos> I have always believed that he was more your type.<eos> - I did for you, actually.
- For what?<eos> - Sit down and shut up.<eos> You sound like The Sly One.<eos> Perhaps you are the god of mischief who sends men mad and sends them to their deaths.<eos> Sit down!<eos> I curse the day I ever agreed to come with you, Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> For this ship is cursed, and we are...<eos> Release the ravens.<eos> If the birds do not return, there is land.<eos> But if they do...
It marks us out.<eos> If you're a priest, which god do you like best?<eos> There is only one god.<eos> Here, you can touch him.<eos> - Are we keeping him?<eos> - Hello.<eos> I've missed your smell and your body.<eos> Children are fine. But I'm still a woman.<eos> Why do you wear this?<eos> All monks do.
Jarl Borg?<eos> Then why didn't you say so at once?<eos> We will just return to our horses then.<eos> You spied on me.<eos> We meant no harm.<eos> They say they are guests of Jarl Borg.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> We are traveling with Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> Then I think Earl Ragnar owes me an apology on your behalf.<eos> Don't you?
Amantha, we talked about this.<eos> Uh-uh. Somebody didn't get the memo.<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey-hey, this isn't Atlanta, before the media attention.<eos> The media sucks.<eos> - Oh, God... mmm... mmm... - Oh... okay.<eos> We never even had an official last poke.<eos> Oh, no-no-no.<eos> We-we kinda did.
- Oh, please. You've been gunning for my job since the day you bounced in here with a lollipop in your mouth.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'll send you a bottle of champagne from the Middle West, wherever the fuck that is.<eos> I'm gonna turn it down.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Are you trying to rub this in or something?<eos> Please believe me.<eos> You should be in the White House.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I never did.
Well, that was quite the exit.<eos> [ music ]<eos> So, what now?<eos> There's a half a platter of nachos left?<eos> - Not hungry.<eos> - You wanna talk?<eos> Okay...<eos> Back when I got that rash from the Kitsune and she Kenzi-napped me and yadda yadda yadda...<eos> She told me that I could be Fae.<eos> - Did she now?
- Which... isn't really true.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - What did Stella say to you?<eos> - You looked upset.<eos> - She told me what happens to humans who are abandoned by the Fae who claimed them.<eos> - You're not Bo's pet.<eos> - I'm not Fae either.<eos> Bo's very strong.<eos> I have every hope and faith that she will emerge safely.<eos> And if she doesn't?
I'm sorry that you're here, but...<eos> Ok, you may not have to be for long.<eos> Every ghost, they're waiting on their door.<eos> Sally, I've been haunting a funeral home.<eos> You can't turn a corner without a ghost blah, blah, blah-ing on about their door.<eos> Ok, then you know about the door, so we just have to figure out how to get you yours.<eos> Every ghost that's waiting has some sort of unresolved issues.<eos> We have to figure out what yours is.<eos> I know exactly what mine is.<eos> - You do?
Get the hell out of my house.<eos> Get out right now.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Stop it!<eos> What is going on?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> I came in and he practically had Erin pinned on the bed.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Like hell you didn't!
We were supposed to have lunch today.<eos> Yeah, ok. It's no problem.<eos> I'll...<eos> And maybe go home, get some of her things in case she wakes up, maybe some pyjamas, her toothbrush.<eos> Nora.<eos> We're doing exactly what we should be doing right now.<eos> We're just being with her,ok?<eos> This is... it's the best thing we can do.<eos> I know that Aidan's our friend.<eos> I do.
But his caps out at a little over 200 years.<eos> You know, and Erin ran away.<eos> Liam was the one who found her.<eos> He was the one who brought her home.<eos> And he hasn't exactly hidden the fact that he wants Aidan... that he wants all vampires dead.<eos> Why can't you just... for once admit that he might've done something wrong.<eos> I get it.<eos> I understand what you're saying.<eos> I just don't think that he meant to hurt her.<eos> I really don't.
No, I mean, no, I am not used to...<eos> I mean, yes, people say no to me.<eos> Ok.<eos> Then no.<eos> No what?<eos> I didn't ask a yes or no question, or any question.<eos> No, you may not break your date with me.<eos> Isn't that more like saying yes, only really forcibly?<eos> Do you know how hard it is to find a layperson who can argue about the Continental Congress?<eos> I do, actually.
I put the word out that you and Nora were off-limits.<eos> I should have remembered Pete.<eos> He didn't deserve that.<eos> No.<eos> I told Blake it only takes a sip.<eos> Yeah, that's a real shocker that she and her buddies didn't use a little restraint.<eos> Listen, I understand that you were trying to protect Nora and me.<eos> I just... I can't believe that you would side with them over someone like Pete.<eos> - I didn't pick sides!<eos> - Yes, you did!
- Really?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause those things aren't even in the same solar system.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You felt alone.<eos> You were scared to talk about it.<eos> Aidan just killed someone!<eos> Something, whatever.<eos> I wish I was ok with that.<eos> I really do.
You don't belong in this plane.<eos> I'm not going back to limbo.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You know what happens when a death spot is destroyed?<eos> You say we're linked?<eos> I'll take you with me.<eos> I'll leave you there.<eos> I'll shred you.<eos> You don't know what I can do.<eos> Oh no, I do.
- You're new in town.<eos> - How can you tell?<eos> I'm proud to be your sister.<eos> You two are sisters?<eos> Now you cut that man down!<eos> I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.<eos> Shtako!<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> - You know who we work for?<eos> - I do.
An hour.<eos> An hour and a half.<eos> You know, I didn't expect to see you again so soon.<eos> I had a doctor's appointment.<eos> Oh.<eos> You like to read?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Have you read that one?<eos> I'm not supposed to.<eos> But you did, right?
A dream?<eos> Your dreams have very low cases of accuracy, Lord Bills.<eos> Even before, you dreamt an idol moving here, and it was wrong.<eos> Are you treating me like an idiot?<eos> Okay, follow me Whis!<eos> Oracle Fish, Oracle Fish, are you there!<eos> I went for a walk.<eos> You said 39 years ago that, in 39 years, I'll face an enemy of threat.<eos> I said that?<eos> You did!
It healed.<eos> Ah, thank God.<eos> I hated it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It is not a double date.<eos> It is a group thing.<eos> Do they know it's a group thing?<eos> 'Cause I told you that I'm not ready to get back out there.<eos> You were in France and didn't do any dating for four months?<eos> Did you?
Well, no.<eos> No plan, sorry.<eos> If you don't have a plan, we're dead!<eos> Yes.<eos> We are.<eos> So just tell me.<eos> Tell you what?<eos> Well, there's no point now, we're about to die, so just tell me who you are.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> No, I don't!
He's with you'?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Brought your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh?<eos> Now that's moxie.<eos> Get over here and pop a squat.<eos> Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests.<eos> - Thank you for meeting with me.<eos> As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping...<eos> - Sure. But first, you gotta check out my new venture:<eos> moving pictures.<eos> Zhu Li, do the thing.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra.<eos> I'll go talk to Bolin.<eos> Hey, Mako, what do you think?<eos> I did a little redecorating.<eos> It turns out that one of the perks of being a star... you get lots of cash.<eos> Is this a marble statue of you?<eos> It's also a hat rack.<eos> We don't even have hats.<eos> That's because we've never had a hat rack.<eos> And now we do.
Tell me who sent you!<eos> It was Varrick. Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!<eos> I think this is our cue to exit.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> It's a knockout!<eos> They're falling back.<eos> Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the north.<eos> Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.<eos> I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming.<eos> Actually, someone did.
Professor Zei.<eos> I see that you have some knowledge of the past, so you should know that humans are no longer allowed in my library.<eos> Get out.<eos> I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge.<eos> Those are the old rules.<eos> Besides, what is a little girl going to teach Wan Shi Tong, he who knows 10,000 things?<eos> Well, since you've been down in the spirit world, the humans have invented radio.<eos> Yes, I am well aware of the radio.<eos> But do you know how it works?<eos> Of course I do.
He is a charmer, I got to tell you that.<eos> Been putting the wood to your girlfriend Andrea.<eos> - Big time, baby.<eos> What?<eos> Andrea's in Woodbury?<eos> Right next to the Governor.<eos> I told you to drop that!<eos> You know Andrea?<eos> Hey, do you know Andrea?<eos> Yep, she does.
With Tomas, Andrew.<eos> Look what happened.<eos> - Axel and Oscar weren't like them.<eos> - And where's Oscar now?<eos> I can't be responsible.<eos> You turn us out, you are responsible.<eos> Rick.<eos> You've done so much for us.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> We all do.
She has none, Sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see these?<eos> Circles.<eos> Many circles.<eos> These letters, Emily, do you think it possible she might have ran and responded to adverts in the Lonely Hearts?<eos> It is possible, yes.<eos> Sergeant, we are going back to work.<eos> Does that suit you?<eos> Yes, Mr Reid, it does.
Jack!<eos> I'm trying to study, okay?<eos> Why don't you just... why don't you just try to settle down, and watch a little TV or something?<eos> I think the Mighty Hour is on.<eos> I mean, if this is a miracle, I think I could get on that.<eos> Come on, Grace, just cut the cast off for me.<eos> I can't cut a cast off with my mother's pinking shears.<eos> She doesn't have one of those little saws, does she?<eos> No.<eos> She does not.
It's a simple swab test.<eos> It was nothing, but it could be everything.<eos> Well, even if it turns out that you two have the same spit or genes, or whatever, that doesn't mean anything.<eos> It means that Robie is my son.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> Uh, biologically, and legally, it does.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> George, I know this is difficult for you to grasp, but it changes everything.<eos> Or it could.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Yeah, we're good.<eos> I knew guys like Wicks in prison guys that never stop digging graves for themselves and then trading everything and everyone to keep from getting buried.<eos> Hey, Hood, I never saw the paperwork on that Leonard Vanderwick guy.<eos> That get filed or...?<eos> He wasn't worth the effort.<eos> I sent him packing.<eos> Guys like that don't go down without taking everyone close down with him.<eos> That's their game.<eos> How did he know you anyway?<eos> He didn't.
- Wait, you said...<eos> Can you not see how hysterical I am right now, unable to process what just happened to me?<eos> God, dad!<eos> You are so dumb.<eos> I forgot how fun this is.<eos> So fun.<eos> Wanna take a break?<eos> Sure.<eos> You probably know what I wanna talk about, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Have you traveled far?<eos> Yes.<eos> A long way.<eos> Abraham.<eos> Where is your wife?<eos> In there.<eos> Next year, Sarah will have a son.<eos> Why do you laugh?<eos> - I didn't laugh.<eos> - You did.
I have never cut my hair.<eos> I am forbidden.<eos> It's a sign of my devotion.<eos> - If I cut my hair, I...<eos> - What, my love?<eos> What if you cut your hair?<eos> My god will take away all my strength.<eos> I'll be as weak as everyone else.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> No, Samson, I do.
Steal questions for the exam ?<eos> Yes, I know , it's crazy !<eos> Yes , the madness ...<eos> I even found a check!<eos> Yes, they bought the mask !<eos> Steal questions ....<eos> - Or maybe it's for skiing ?<eos> - Stupid.<eos> Excuse me ?<eos> I do not , no, no ...
Sun...<eos> What's your name?<eos> My name's Emma.<eos> What do you do?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hairdresser?<eos> Fourth year of Fine Arts.<eos> Fine Arts?<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm having a blast.<eos> They put me to the test, push my limits. But it's fascinating.<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> Yeah, I think.<eos> That's good.<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> But time-consuming.<eos> I have no time for myself.<eos> You don't go out?<eos> I do, but with other teachers.
No! No!<eos> I took her to the fair yesterday.<eos> She asked me for a tooth check.<eos> A tooth check, come on.<eos> - It means nothing.<eos> - Who the fuck cares? That's means nothing.<eos> Rags will give me a tooth check.<eos> All the time.<eos> - Right...<eos> - You guys do tooth checks?
- What does Leo think of all of this?<eos> - Oh, he's still never read it.<eos> - Do you really believe that?<eos> - Believe it.<eos> - Yes! He has this amazing ability to just ignore criticism... which, you know, I admired at first. And then I came to see it as his worst trait.<eos> What does make him angry?<eos> He was the writer.<eos> I have news, Jules, writing a blog does not make you a writer.<eos> - Speaking of, you have some news.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Right, Balls?<eos> - Your cat's name is Balls?<eos> With arthritis, shouldn't that be swollen Balls?<eos> Yeah, joint pain, hilarious.<eos> I don't know what this is, but I don't want to be a part of it.<eos> Just lose the plant.<eos> I probably won't. Just being honest.<eos> And I probably won't give a shit.<eos> - You sure got me.<eos> - Yeah. Actually, I did.
Is it so surprising, though?<eos> There's always been something seriously wrong with them.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know, the right kind of wrong, for each other.<eos> It's kind of what we weren't.<eos> You're a good writer, Jules.<eos> Thank you.<eos> From you that means a lot.<eos> And I should've climbed mountains for you.<eos> I did a lot wrong, too.
Show it to me. 16.<eos> Get Ryan on the phone.<eos> Use a landline.<eos> Jake, let's go.<eos> - 15 seconds live.<eos> - 16's up.<eos> - Play it.<eos> - Package goes in 60.<eos> Did you know that in '91, 20 Kuwaitis died after being hit by falling bullets while celebrating the end of the Cold War?<eos> - I didn't.
You mean Joel and John?<eos> Shelly, you started off with one clear and not unreasonable demand and now you've got, like, 14 of them, including arresting Bear Stearns and the Lehman Brothers.<eos> You doing a story or giving advice?<eos> I haven't been assigned the story, so I'm giving advice.<eos> And you can't have a protest unless the media's covering it.<eos> The media is gonna cover it.<eos> But they're gonna cover the drum circles and crunchy, uninformed college kids yelling at the earners, who, coincidently, are the same guys running Time Warner News Corp.<eos> and AWM.<eos> You don't have the patience for complicated things.<eos> I do.
Mm-hm, the whole lot.<eos> It's like fish food.<eos> He likes the taste of it.<eos> Better leave him to it.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I have to go in a minute.<eos> Oh, don't leave me here with it!<eos> Sorry. Look, you can hear - it's starting already.<eos> Don't switch the bathroom light on.<eos> Don't what?
So...that happened.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So how did you two meet?<eos> Oh, it's a really funny story, actually.<eos> It's actually the cutest of meets.<eos> I wasn't feeling very well about myself at the time, and I ended up at, um...<eos> What, a church?<eos> It's a church-like place.<eos> I mean, they talked a lot about God there.<eos> - They did.
Why'd you go to the one in west Hollywood?<eos> Because it was closer to where I was meeting Gina for lunch.<eos> What time did you go to the gym?<eos> Tell me something, do you find Gina attractive? No.<eos> I'd never hire an assistant I find attractive.<eos> Why not?<eos> She's a pretty girl.<eos> Do you find Ryan attractive?<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, I'm dead hungry.<eos> I know the perfect place, actually.<eos> "Soup du jour".<eos> Sounds... sounds good.<eos> I've had that type before, it is good.<eos> I can also recommend the... .. the wine.<eos> So. Natasha.<eos> Do you have a family and-slash-or a pet?<eos> If so, how are they? Are they well?<eos> SHE CHUCKLES Er, no, I don't, sorry.
Give me...<eos> "HE WILL RISE"<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Natasha, did Hatch speak to you?<eos> - Hatch?<eos> - Captain Hatch.<eos> Right before you came here, did he say something to you?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Oh, sweetie, please, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry we ruined your night.<eos> That's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You were up there singing, it was so lovely, and we just, we made a mess of it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Sutton and I just wanted this to be a night to heal and... now the problem seems worse.<eos> Sweetie, you have to leave this alone.<eos> You both do.
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches.<eos> Did I say that out loud?<eos> Me sore eyes can't wait to see the queen and the princess.<eos> I bet they are absolutely lovely.<eos> I bet they are beautiful.<eos> Princess Anna?<eos> - Princess Anna?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Sorry to wake you, ma'am.<eos> No, no, no, you didn't.
Yeah, me.<eos> I got to be honest with you, son.<eos> You're no Clancy.<eos> You don't have the skills or the balls to do what's got to be done.<eos> I'll find the bastard myself.<eos> No, no way.<eos> You almost killed an innocent kid.<eos> We need a professional.<eos> We don't have a professional.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You broke half his house.<eos> - I want to use my out now.<eos> - All right, you can take it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I told you!<eos> I told you!<eos> - Damn it, Spencer.<eos> I should have known.<eos> - Shawn, you lied to me.<eos> - No, I didn't.
In my defense, chief, I am that good, and there's an anatomically correct trophy over my toilet that confirms that fact.<eos> Clear the room, now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> But not you, Shawn.<eos> There is nothing more dangerous than having an investigator who is emotionally involved.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> How about a raccoon with a discarded malaria sample?<eos> And I'd be crazy to tell you to go after Jerry Carp.<eos> - Yeah, I know that, chief.<eos> - No, you don't.

I'm Detective O'Hara.<eos> And you may not recognize me, but I'm also Helene, the undercover decoy working the case.<eos> Sweet. I'm Shawn Spencer.<eos> Uh, now that Lordan is less probable, our next likely of the six original suspects goes on the site with the name of "Mr. Possibilities." Can you pull him up, please?<eos> Mr. Possibilities?<eos> Try "Mr. Perfect."<eos> Wow, he looks like a male model.<eos> I was a hand model.<eos> You want to buy this pen?<eos> No? Now you do.
Listen, if you ask me,<eos> I think your profile needs some sprucing up.<eos> - Sprucing up?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> You seem sort of middle of the road.<eos> I mean, who lists The Mentalist as one of their favorite TV shows?<eos> You need to get more spicy.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Why would you make fun of The Mentalist?<eos> - I-I don't really--
Maybe a little too much.<eos> I just didn't think that you were into me.<eos> I mean, you actually-- you made me a little nervous, because I just didn't think that someone like you would take someone like me seriously.<eos> It's true.<eos> I just wondered, the whole time, what you looked like without those glasses.<eos> May I?<eos> See?<eos> That is so much better.<eos> When I look into your eyes, I see how deeply you feel things, and I understand why you had to do what you did to those girls.<eos> - You do?
Okay, now we're going to find him, and then we're all going to get out of here.<eos> Chi-Chi, how are we doing on battery?<eos> Uh, half, and we still have auxiliary.<eos> Nice, we're ready when you are.<eos> Jules, you're upset.<eos> Why are you filming this, Shawn?<eos> You're emotional, and if this was me saying,<eos> "Hey, let's go poke the hornet's nest with one of Gus's shoes," you would say no, and you would force me to be reasonable.<eos> - Shawn, I smell barbecue.<eos> - No, you don't, buddy.
Mexican me?<eos> The hell are you blabbering about, Spencer?<eos> Call the airport.<eos> Tell 'em to get a plane ready.<eos> What?<eos> - Don't tell me what to do.<eos> - Lloyd's being framed!<eos> We're going back to old Mexico!<eos> - Dude, you don't have to come.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What the hell--<eos> What you just said about me, I feel the same way about you.<eos> Uh--you--I...<eos> What is that?<eos> A bulletproof vest?<eos> How long have you had that on?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> Oh, I've had this the whole time.<eos> You don't think I would come down to such a dangerous place without protection, do you?<eos> I did.
No, no, no. Barack and Michelle got slammed in the press after doing that in public.<eos> We'll stick to culturally neutral salutations until we see some polling.<eos> Dude, I think you can afford to rove it down a notch.<eos> We're not trying to win, remember?<eos> We're just trying to keep a killer from taking over the city.<eos> I know, Shawn, but you still don't want to look ridiculous.<eos> They may ask you the tough questions.<eos> - Food carts?<eos> - You plan to have a food cart on every corner by the end of your mandate.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I am sensing that you are approximately 41-- nay, 42 years old.<eos> You are a germaphobe, an obsessive hand washer and hand wrangler.<eos> You're a big fan of the Dyson Airblade because of the way it makes you feel in other places.<eos> You hail from Buffalo.<eos> Your favorite sport is basketball.<eos> And you had a golden retriever named Buddy, that was a very lonely boy's only friend in the whole wide world.<eos> How does that smell?<eos> Like bacon?<eos> Do you believe in psychics now, Mr. Troutman?<eos> No. In fact, even less than I did two minutes ago.
- Well, we can't gue with that.<eos> Well, we could argue if we were given a chance.<eos> - Glover.<eos> Daphne, it's a dumb idea.<eos> - It is a really good idea.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Do you think it's a good idea?<eos> - Hai!<eos> I don't like it.<eos> - Don't.
She added something, right?<eos> She told me she did...<eos> In the channel.<eos> It was... it was, like, a-a little part...<eos> - Look, I'm not gonna sit here and argue what constitutes composition with somebody who brings their baby to work. I'm offering you an opportunity with the promise of more. It's a cowrite with pixie, or it's...<eos> Nothing.<eos> That is the gig.<eos> And I'm being clear with you, because I know you appreciate that kind of thing.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.
The balls on that son of a-- I got all these little pieces.<eos> They're all part of the story, right?<eos> But they don't mean much on their own.<eos> But when you start telling me what you know, when you start filling in the gaps,<eos> I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.<eos> Hank, I- - I...<eos> I think maybe...<eos> Maybe I need a lawyer.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, you don't.
What?<eos> It's like you said.<eos> It's...<eos> It's blood money.<eos> I s--<eos> Jeez. Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> I said that.<eos> I did.
This is not my country.<eos> I failed.<eos> You cannot fail.<eos> You are as strong as Stalin.<eos> No!<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Even stronger.<eos> You are as strong as God.<eos> God does not exist!<eos> Yes He does.
Right from the heart.<eos> Bucephalus... you have everything.<eos> I grew up on the streets, treated with contempt,<eos> amongst cruel people, howling like a dog for a bit of affection.<eos> They shut me up in a fortress.<eos> And there I remain, hungry for affection.<eos> No one has given me what you give me now.<eos> Well done, Jaime!<eos> You'll win over Bucephalus yet!<eos> Really well done!
So, five months later, a little more persuasion, and behold...<eos> toys of our own and the authority to use 'em.<eos> Anything big goes down between Fort Lee, Block Island, and Stamford, Connecticut, it's mine.<eos> Ours.<eos> And, hey, now yours.<eos> Lara Sonnenland.<eos> Carrie, Al, anything I can do for you, you know where to find me.<eos> Delson.<eos> I don't recall agreeing to all this.<eos> Oh, I do... we didn't.
Well, these guys do their homework.<eos> Anything off schedule, we're blown.<eos> Well, there won't be any trucks there that aren't supposed to be there.<eos> We do our homework, too.<eos> What's she doing?<eos> What she does.<eos> You never know what will be important later.<eos> (Sighs) Your guys are gonna blow it just like in Westport.<eos> - Come on, you don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Besides, those two like working with you.<eos> And that is a first.<eos> What about Webster?<eos> Really?<eos> Fine, but if she calls me Ellie again,<eos> I'm-I'm gonna ship her off to Ronkonkoma... wherever the hell that is.<eos> Look, I know I've been acting like this is some kind of dream job, but if it's not your dream...<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but...<eos> I want to stay.<eos> You do?
Nice one, Benji.<eos> Stop calling me that.<eos> You love it.<eos> No, I hate it.<eos> No, you love it.<eos> Diego!<eos> Diego!<eos> It's Jeanne!<eos> Don't you recognize me?<eos> He doesn't.
On the contrary.<eos> You can expect them to attack Charleston in force.<eos> Really?<eos> It seems we knocked a lot of their assets out today, destroyed most of their fuel supply.<eos> Most, but not all.<eos> We have learned that they are bringing in every surviving Mech and Beamer in this region, consolidating whatever supplies they have left and will hit you hard to prove you have not weakened them.<eos> So I advise you to keep your soldiers on the perimeter at high alert.<eos> Dad.<eos> I, uh, guess you heard about me blowing a hole in that building.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
It makes me feel sick.<eos> I've done things.<eos> Bad things.<eos> In the past.<eos> Really bad things.<eos> And my son has paid the price.<eos> Your son had bacterial meningitis, Jimmy.<eos> An illness, that's all.<eos> You don't believe a son has to pay for the sins of his father?<eos> No, I don't.
Listen, the guys upstairs are pressuring me.<eos> Oh, I see where this talk is going.<eos> It's only temporary, until this fiasco blows over.<eos> Tomorrow another clip will go viral.<eos> That's how it is these days on the net.<eos> You're a star for a split second.<eos> - Let's just hope he won't sue.<eos> - He won't.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
I really don't know.<eos> No!<eos> You smell that, Gidin'ka?<eos> It smells like a barbeque.<eos> You have no idea how much I've missed that smell.<eos> His mom turned me into a vegetarian... because of my high cholesterol.<eos> Oh, I could go on all night!<eos> Gidin'ka... I remember you loved hot dogs as a kid.<eos> - Do you still like hot dogs?<eos> - Who doesn't?
It'll be our little secret.<eos> You're full of surprises today, huh?<eos> Dad... I need you to watch over these two until I get back.<eos> You can trust me.<eos> My wife.<eos> - Hello, Malka!<eos> - Hello.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> - Do you know what time it is?<eos> - I do, I do.
He'll be back any minute now.<eos> - Did you do it?<eos> - I didn't do a thing.<eos> Untie me!<eos> If you don't release me now, you're making a big mistake.<eos> You'll regret it for the rest of your life.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Why do you Jews always think that we all want to kill you?<eos> No, not at all, but... you know how it is.<eos> Yes, unfortunately I do.
Uh, sure.<eos> You know, it's like we always say around here...<eos> If you have an employee discount, make "dis" count.<eos> Great.<eos> I wrote it all down.<eos> This is some list...<eos> that continues on the back.<eos> How are you gonna carry all this?<eos> Didn't you say employees get free delivery?<eos> Yes, I did.
[ Sighs ]<eos> I feel like I need to have my entire body snaked.<eos> It's your own fault.<eos> You stopped spitting.<eos> Because I'd rather feel horrible than look stupid.<eos> Which is also my family motto.<eos> Well, if you want to go lay down for a bit, I can start crunching the data.<eos> Uh, thanks, but I need to start writing the article.<eos> But you don't know who won.<eos> [ Chuckles ] - Sure, I do.
Been there, done that.<eos> And your daughter's boyfriend is a hell of a photographer.<eos> He actually took a picture of me I can stand to look at.<eos> Why did he take your picture?<eos> Because he had a camera?<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> This guy is not my daughter's boyfriend.<eos> You said he was the nerdy one.<eos> Damn right I did.
Yes, he is.<eos> Frank, I hear that you are heading up the special election in my home state.<eos> - Peter Russo.<eos> - We're trying to keep that under the radar until he officially announces.<eos> In fact, we're not even working out of my office until that happens.<eos> - Where are you working from?<eos> - The basement of my house.<eos> Any reason why the D.N.C. didn't ask my advice on the candidate?<eos> Well, I thought they passed it by you, or Linda did.<eos> - Nobody did.
Hmm.<eos> That's work.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Should we keep looking or...<eos> There's not really much of a point. She's not here.<eos> She wears the pants.<eos> She pays the bills.<eos> And I don't necessarily mind it.<eos> Yes, you do.
- It's a little bit more important than that.<eos> It's a gift. For Danny T.<eos> You've got ten minutes.<eos> - Hey, a gift?<eos> - She sais.<eos> This guy killed my fuckin kid.<eos> Please tell me, you kow where this motherfucker is.<eos> - Guess what?<eos> Time to go.<eos> - She does.
- Nah that's not the deal.<eos> Nah she's gonna show us the way.<eos> I'll bring her back.<eos> - Listen I can hold 'em only about a week.<eos> - Thanks Teedo, you're a big help.<eos> Is there anything you need to tell me?<eos> Yeah there is but not now, I got a lot of heat.<eos> Alright then, let me go load up these nags.<eos> - Hi there sherrif.<eos> - Hey Gator. How you doing?
And those kids want you out of here.<eos> So do I.<eos> If I take the deal with Conpine, are you willing to give us another try?<eos> You ever talk to Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> I sure do miss her.<eos> She's long dead, Kenny.<eos> Do you miss her?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I do.
Yeah, but too stupid to do anything about it.<eos> I already tried.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> Sure.<eos> How do you know if a guy you've been hanging out with likes you?<eos> You like him?<eos> Uh-huh, but I think he hates me.<eos> Ask him.<eos> Doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> No guy ever does.
- A rolling stone.<eos> - She put my hand there.<eos> I didn't even move it.<eos> That is something exactly like my father would have said.<eos> Did that fatty actually cop a feel?<eos> He totally copped a feel.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> I mean, what's up with that?<eos> Shit, Mickey.<eos> What the hell you doing here?
And besides, you don't look like you're doing too bad, driving a car like this.<eos> Hey, fuck you. This isn't my car.<eos> - Well, whose car is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Why don't you check the glove box, see if there's any registration in there.<eos> The owner is Roberta Shaw.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'll be right back.<eos> If you don't trust me as the mother... I'm the mother of your unborn babies, but no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I want you to go ask.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No!<eos> I want you to ask him.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I trust you. I do.<eos> I do.
Hi. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm Jack Watson.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have I done anything wrong?<eos> You tell us, boy genius.<eos> You tell us.<eos> You wouldn't know the whereabouts of one Ms Elaine Nussbaum?<eos> About 90 years old, 5'9", missing a couple of teeth?<eos> - Nope.<eos> No, I don't.
Don't!<eos> You probably have some complex accounting you have to see to. Stop!<eos> Don't!<eos> Murray!<eos> Don't!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Then I imagine you set aside - 15 minutes preciously on the Internet... - Stop it!<eos> They watch those videos!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Don't!
Mo, He has not abandoned us.<eos> They will come.<eos> Brother Erian always said we were warned, that there were omens, the people reaped in sin, and now all this death...<eos> Brother Erian believed this.<eos> I do not.<eos> - And nor should you. - He said:<eos> God punishes all sinners.<eos> He did, he did.<eos> Do you believe the whole Angles men sins?<eos> I do not.
You don't even think I'm a writer, do you?<eos> I think you're a writer if you keep on writing, Becca.<eos> Am I a writer?<eos> Well, I know that, when I saw you read your pages here in the coffeehouse, I was-- I was proud of you.<eos> You saw me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I snuck in and then out again unseen.<eos> I asked you not to come.<eos> I know, but you didn't really mean it.<eos> Yes, I did.
I know how to get shit done.<eos> Now your cock's on the verge of making a decision, Hank.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> - Everything okay in here?<eos> - Things are not as they seem.<eos> Can you give us a fucking minute here?<eos> - You don't want to do this.<eos> - I do. No, no, no.<eos> You love your husband.<eos> - I do.
Well I got stuck in the traffic coming on the fucking hill.<eos> From London, England, by way of Mars The Bacardi Concert series presents:<eos> Atticus Fucking-Fetch!<eos> Good luck out there.<eos> Not that you need it.<eos> You're a fucking rock star<eos> A long way from church, eh?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Do you, bald fucking wanker, take this sexy little tree stump to be your immortal beloved?<eos> I most certainly do.

No.<eos> Not hurt.<eos> Not even close.<eos> I can explain, all right?<eos> I'm in the middle of a... a situation.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't do this to me.<eos> God, I am such an idiot.<eos> I thought you and I had that thing...<eos> - Mads, we do. - No.
Well, a girl can dream.<eos> You never cease to amaze me<eos> I'm just keeping my eye on the prize.<eos> So, what's with the sexy dress?<eos> I was with Ethan at Dan and Theresa's engagement party.<eos> - They're engaged?<eos> - Mm-hmm. How power couple.<eos> Alec was there.<eos> I overheard him talking to Dan, telling him that he wants him to keep investigating Derek's murder.<eos> Well, of course he does.
Ryan: He's finding people.<eos> They're his followers.<eos> Prison guard, gay neighbors-- how do they figure into your new plot?<eos> We know about the cult.<eos> I like to think of them as my friends.<eos> So what's my sequel about, Joe?<eos> We're gonna write this together, Ryan, even though you slept with my wife.<eos> Did she show you the letter?<eos> - How does he know?<eos> - He doesn't.
So tell me about Carroll's accomplices.<eos> He used this prison guard to gain access to the internet to create a following, like a cult.<eos> Let's not use that word.<eos> People don't hear it well.<eos> Well, you can call it what you want, but he solicited people to do his bidding.<eos> Carroll mentioned a letter?<eos> Claire Matthews received a letter about a week before Carroll's escape.<eos> It was personal.<eos> He questioned my relationship with her.<eos> As did the FBI 8 years ago.
I have to kill her.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> And you have to watch.<eos> Those are the rules, or, uh--<eos> Or what?<eos> Or you have to kill me.<eos> I'm not sure I'm ready to die.<eos> Jordy, nobody has to die.<eos> Joe doesn't want her to die.<eos> Yes, he does!
- You already exposed her to this.<eos> - So what, you gonna leave me?<eos> You gonna leave me again?<eos> What kind of mom is you?<eos> You gonna fuck around and leave me in here?<eos> You ain't never had my fuckin' back anyway.<eos> I'm in here by myself.<eos> - I love you, Oscar.<eos> - You don't love nothin'.<eos> I do.
their game is over.<eos> You sure you can get me there?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I am.<eos> Then get me to the vault.<eos> Diamond formation.<eos> Stay low, stay close, shoot first.<eos> Got it? On me.<eos> Do you have the vice president?<eos> Irepeat,do youhavethevicepresident?
"I do not know, Percy, she's ..."<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I do not find it funny, So who do you do it?<eos> Is this about Chrissy?<eos> - What does this have to do with Chrissy?<eos> No idea.<eos> I do not think I've done something wrong.<eos> You act!<eos> You do that all the time.
Last name was...<eos> Livingston.<eos> Merriam Livingston.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Cult Productions.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Did not mean to startle you.<eos> No, Peter, you didn't.
Your inability to see the obvious.<eos> - Your assistant has good taste.<eos> - I fired her months ago.<eos> She suggested blue, she had to go.<eos> It's nice.<eos> I can exchange it.<eos> No, I'll find someone to give it to.<eos> She may have something for him, too.<eos> She's just waiting to see if he deserves it.<eos> He doesn't.
- Anna.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> Do you think I care?<eos> Do you think I could ever love someone as deceitful as you?<eos> No, fuck you.<eos> This was not the deal.<eos> Now you're gonna go and find someone and fuck around on me.<eos> - Stop this.<eos> - Did you tell her who I was?<eos> Did you?
Five was all I could save.<eos> Carlo hates me.<eos> Maybe he has reasons.<eos> But he was the only one who could bring her to me.<eos> I thought he'd ask 10.<eos> Then you saw the suit.<eos> - Richie Rich.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> It means you thought I had money.<eos> - And you don't?
Carlo hates me.<eos> Maybe he has reasons.<eos> But he was the only one who could bring her to me.<eos> I thought he'd ask 10.<eos> Then you saw the suit.<eos> - Richie Rich.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> It means you thought I had money.<eos> - And you don't?<eos> - No, I don't.
I don't have to.<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Can you do something for me?<eos> Anything.<eos> - It's really important.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - Will you forgive me?<eos> - Baby, none of this is your fault.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll tell him you brought it.<eos> You know that I would never hurt him.<eos> Right?<eos> It's just us here.<eos> Come on, you know.<eos> - What do you want, Julia?<eos> - Just tell me that you know.<eos> You hate me, I cheated on you, but...<eos> - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do.
But you have to be honest and tell me.<eos> Did you actually like the movie?<eos> No, yeah, I did.
- An electric razor.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Have a good practice.<eos> - Take it easy. Thanks.<eos> Mom?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can we, uh, go to the drugstore?<eos> Sure.<eos> I like that guy, Philip.<eos> Really? You do?
- Okay.<eos> - Have a good practice.<eos> - Take it easy. Thanks.<eos> Mom?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can we, uh, go to the drugstore?<eos> Sure.<eos> I like that guy, Philip.<eos> Really? You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Let's prove him wrong.<eos> Love to.<eos> I am tired of being outflanked by this civilian.<eos> Lieutenant Leeds.<eos> Perhaps you should tell us the specifics of your conversation with Evan Cross.<eos> Perhaps you should tell me why you're asking.<eos> You're not a major anymore, Leeds.<eos> You don't get to talk to me like that.<eos> Did you tell them where we are?<eos> Uh, no, sir, I did not.
Why do you want my technology?<eos> Happy to tell you.<eos> I want direct access to the time portals.<eos> The anomalies, and Lieutenant Leeds seems to be very impressed with your handheld detectors.<eos> And I'm sure you'd bring the same level of competence to using my equipment that you brought to recapturing a terror bird in the city.<eos> How many of your men died, exactly?<eos> You know, I could've just seized your factory.<eos> I don't need your permission.<eos> You don't seem to need permission from anybody.<eos> If you did,
You're so good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Cece, hold up a second.<eos> You're not going to make me wait till next game to see you again, are you?<eos> You're cute, but I'm seeing someone.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Look at you.<eos> How serious is it?<eos> You don't like to lose, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, we're all part of the same team here.<eos> We all have one goal, to save the world, starting with your patient.<eos> Awesome, tremors!<eos> That makes it easier.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> She's got enough poison to fight without you adding to it.<eos> Oh, and you think this is going the way it should?<eos> Toby is dying.<eos> They're going to make it.<eos> And what if they don't?
But sweetie, I have to get home too.<eos> Forget your mom, what's your dad's number?<eos> Give me his phone number.<eos> No, mommy will cry.<eos> Why does she cry?<eos> Mommy cried everyday because of him She cries now too.<eos> You don't live with dad?<eos> He's in America, he left mommy and me.<eos> That can't be, who'd leave a princess?<eos> He did!
There's someone I want out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Let's go It's our last chance to leave.<eos> I can get you out of the city.<eos> Go ahead, In-hye.<eos> There are infected inside.<eos> I know, but this is my job.<eos> No one here knows what you do for a living.<eos> But I do.
Your kid's #2066 Next!<eos> I left my children at home.<eos> - I was picked up. - Coming through - while out for a bit.<eos> - It's Jigu!<eos> - Mirre!<eos> He's naked.<eos> Move.<eos> - Come on, don't look.<eos> - Why the hell not!<eos> Just Don't.
Um, Marty, I-I don't really...<eos> Because a lot of weird stuff happened that night.<eos> I mean a lot yeah.<eos> Of really weird shit went down with the rainmaker, with you, with me.<eos> And when I left the hotel,<eos> I didn't have any underpants.<eos> Wow.<eos> There's people right there.<eos> And I'm not sure if, um, we...<eos> Did we...?
And when I left the hotel,<eos> I didn't have any underpants.<eos> Wow.<eos> There's people right there.<eos> And I'm not sure if, um, we...<eos> Did we...?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I'm just gonna. Be honest right now, Marty.<eos> I blacked out, so I don't know if...<eos> Did we...?
Mm, no, you did the running man.<eos> I don't know how to do the running man.<eos> Jeannie, do the running man.<eos> Yeah, I know that now.<eos> What else, Marty?<eos> Oh, my God, Marty, what else?<eos> Marty, you and your pod have a 9:45 conference call with Mr. Pincus.<eos> Thanks. Who set up Pincus?<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I don't...
Then beat him.<eos> Think yöu can?<eos> Can yöu?<eos> Yes I can.<eos> yöu'll beat Sher Singh Rana?<eos> Have yöu seen him run?<eos> He's like a bullet.<eos> Have yöu the guts?<eos> Have yöu the guts?<eos> Yes, I do.

Give me the details, CID will call you back when someone's available.<eos> Sir, for you.<eos> You need to get yourself organised up there.<eos> It's Saturday and the phone lines can't cope.<eos> Hello.<eos> Broadchurch Police.<eos> Morning.<eos> We got you a coffee.<eos> I don't drink coffee.<eos> Course you don't.
Don't reassure people.<eos> Let them talk.<eos> Can I just say: you can't just rock up here and try to mould me.<eos> I know what I'm doing, and I know how to handle people.<eos> And you can keep your broody bullshit shtick to yourself.<eos> Can I make anyone a... cup of tea?<eos> Where's the crisps?<eos> Why's there no crisps?<eos> You don't want crisps.<eos> I do.
I could ask you the same question.<eos> This is good.<eos> Steve, why don't you join us this time?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> This time?<eos> Steve, have a seat.<eos> John?<eos> Arthur, I don't want to.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Take them along, Sona.<eos> You can score better if you copy.<eos> You're too much. - Is it?<eos> Let's go.<eos> You remember everything, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Concentrate on your studies. And do well in your exams. Yes.<eos> - Why don't you go with her?<eos> Why? - How many times will you tell her...<eos> Do good, do good. Hey!
Mm... (Sighs)<eos> (Door creaks and slams)<eos> Just so you know, that was an angry door slam. (Slams)<eos> (Rock music playing)<eos> (Turns music off)<eos> How could you offer my mother that job?<eos> I mean, sure, she drank her way through Europe-- and the United States, and the safer parts of South America-- but I'm the one who cares about this store.<eos> I am the one with a young child to support, and I am the one who knows to pair a French triple cream with the whimsical citrus notes of a crisp chardonnay.<eos> I-I didn't know you knew that.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
We may have to cancel the wedding.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - He doesn't mean it.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.<eos> Mother will take care of everything.<eos> You got a fix on that Gulanite he's carrying?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe. Maybe I'm just that clever.<eos> Maybe I just want to hear you say it.<eos> Why did you kill the comedian?<eos> Maybe I didn't like his jokes.<eos> I heard you passed the bar exam.<eos> Passed?<eos> Hell. I aced it.<eos> Top 5%.<eos> I always said you had brains, kid.<eos> Yeah, you always did.
- Ivan!<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> What's up?<eos> Fuck, I'm so fucking terrible at this game, man.<eos> They only let me play because I own the team.<eos> I just fucking got kidnapped by the FBI.<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, that's good?<eos> Oh, I knew they'd hit on you sometime, I just didn't know what you'd do.<eos> Now I do.
Okay. What are you gonna do about it?<eos> You don't think I own this place, too?<eos> And where exactly do you think this is?<eos> Bienvenidos a Puerto Rico, Ivan!<eos> Territory of the United States of America.<eos> The Captain, a man of his word.<eos> I knew deep down you were just homesick.<eos> You know what your biggest problem is, Ivan?<eos> You talk and you talk, but you don't actually hear yourself.<eos> Well, I did.
Just go.<eos> - Hedvig's mom just called.<eos> - What did she do? - Leave.<eos> Get out, Kalle!<eos> Kalle can stay.<eos> She said that you force-cut Hedvig's hair.<eos> She considers it abuse and thought about reporting you to the police.<eos> Shit, shit, shit.<eos> She said that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Jon?<eos> Dinner!<eos> I'm not coming down!<eos> Roast chicken with potatoes and peppers, the way you like it.<eos> I'm not hungry!<eos> It's all yours!<eos> I love coming to the flea market on Sundays.<eos> They've got everything.<eos> Do you like them?<eos> You don't.
I'll keep you posted.<eos> They think Jon killed the other kid?<eos> They just want to talk to him.<eos> It's normal. To tell them what happened.<eos> What's he going to tell them?<eos> They almost killed him.<eos> I don't think he's capable of something like this.<eos> How would you know?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> Of course I don't.
If you want to be my friend, tattoo this on your ass to prove you have balls.<eos> - What about this knife?<eos> - I've never seen it before.<eos> It has Jon's prints.<eos> And somebody else's.<eos> But not the dead kid's or his other friends'.<eos> Have you questioned them?<eos> They say they weren't at the beach last night.<eos> They have an alibi?<eos> Of course they do.

The fight on the beach.<eos> Your student was there.<eos> I have many students.<eos> Toni Castro.<eos> Did you see what happened?<eos> I was teaching Toni that night.<eos> He's very good, you know.<eos> Toni told me he was at the fight.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> He did.
You can turn it off.<eos> Petter!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> You hear me?<eos> ! Shut...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I have to find out what happened.<eos> I have to understand, get it?<eos> - I don't need to know.<eos> - But I do!
Just stay by my left, and we'll get through this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can get that guy.<eos> Reload!<eos> Shit.<eos> Living among the outsiders has made you weak.<eos> You used to be great.<eos> That's why the king picked you.<eos> He actually thought you were better than me.<eos> They all did.
I told her father we'd take good care of her.<eos> I take good care of everyone. I know you do.<eos> That's why I'm trusting you to do the same with Jayden.<eos> When does she get here?<eos> She might be here already.<eos> I like your name, Jayden.<eos> It's a boy's name.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Will Smith did.
Can't handle me for yourself, you weak-ass fuck?<eos> Need the bitch to do it for you? Hold her good, Nate.<eos> Yeah, hold me good, Nate.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> You're going to be OK, Jayden. It's going to be OK.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I hate you. That's fine.<eos> You don't have to like me right now.<eos> Just let it pass.<eos> How we doing, Nate?
I'm just, um, confused which direction I'm pointing.<eos> I don't know this kind of psychopath. I've never read about him. I don't even know if he's a psychopath.<eos> He's not insensitive.<eos> He's not shallow.<eos> You know something about him; otherwise, you wouldn't have said, "This is an apology".<eos> What is he apologizing for?<eos> - He couldn't honour her.<eos> He feels bad.<eos> Well, feeling bad defeats the purpose of being<eos> - a psychopath, doesn't it?
Can't block them, can't repress.<eos> - I didn't honor any part of him, So it's just murder, isn't it?<eos> - Most would argue self-defense.<eos> - Then why not tell the truth?<eos> - Most would argue. There would still be those<eos> Who would say you were taking after your father.<eos> - You're glad I killed him.<eos> - What would be the alternative? That he killed you?<eos> - I don't know if he was going to.<eos> - No, you don't.
Where do you go when you escape from the hospital, Abigail?<eos> Sometimes... into the city, sometimes into the woods, sometimes just out.<eos> I go get away from... this, to be alone where I can... think... breathe.<eos> Did you ever meet with Nicholas Boyle on one of your little getaways from the hospital?<eos> Did the two of you know each other before the night he attacked you?<eos> Did he know your father...<eos> And you know nothing about his death?<eos> I know he tried to kill me.<eos> And when he was trying to kill me, all I could think was that I was gonna die in that house after all.<eos> But I didn't.
It... it's hard.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> - Trying to what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Change.<eos> Be a better man, better... better husband.<eos> Frank was right.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> Sir, you have any idea how fast you were going?<eos> No, officer, I don't.
He will ping again, and we will get him.<eos> I'm not bothering you, am i?<eos> Just surprised.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> My generation's got skills when it comes to the Internet.<eos> I was hoping you could, um, help me with something--<eos> A journal.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You paint.<eos> No, my husband did.
I don't speak--<eos> That language doesn't work for you?<eos> How about this one?<eos> I didn't know that the FBI trained their agents in Hindi.<eos> Residual from my Peace Corps days.<eos> There's some rust on it.<eos> You here to arrest me?<eos> I'm here to make peace.<eos> I know what it's like to lose somebody, Hank.<eos> I really do.
I realized I wasn't.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I think we should break up.<eos> (Voice breaks) Um, d-did I do something?<eos> Because I can change.<eos> We can make it work.<eos> It's not you.<eos> You're perfect.<eos> Then why don't you love me?<eos> (Sighs) Mags, I do.
What?<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Do you think you pose a risk to yourself or to others?<eos> I'm asking you because...<eos> I'm thinking about releasing you.<eos> You're gonna send me back out there.<eos> You don't wanna go?<eos> Today I've seen the Dragon.<eos> Yeah... I saw it too.<eos> Yeah, the fuck you did.
It's Christmas. It's fucking Christmas.<eos> What is this?<eos> Today it's Madame who must wait.<eos> Madame, I'm very sorry, but I have to have a few words with Fido first.<eos> I really ought to send you home.<eos> Happy Christmas, Fido.<eos> I want your cock.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I want your cock.<eos> No, you don't. No, you don't.
- You won't lose me.<eos> - What's Sakelik doing here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - We say as little as possible.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> Mr. Sefton.<eos> Ms. Yarrow.<eos> Detective.<eos> So, do you have any news on my brother?<eos> No. I don't.
- Hehe... I didn't think it was real.<eos> I didn't want...<eos> No, it wasn't real, it wasn't real...<eos> Are you...<eos> Are you a werewolf?<eos> - Oh, OK, you know what--<eos> - No, Alyssa!<eos> - What?<eos> - If you wake up a person that's dreaming that they're dying, they actually die.<eos> - No, they don't.
I didn't want...<eos> No, it wasn't real, it wasn't real...<eos> Are you...<eos> Are you a werewolf?<eos> - Oh, OK, you know what--<eos> - No, Alyssa!<eos> - What?<eos> - If you wake up a person that's dreaming that they're dying, they actually die.<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> - Alyssa, they do.
- I think everyone here does.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's true.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> I got nervous, and I never really asked her out.<eos> Dude, you need to have more confidence.<eos> Maybe you should get a spray tan.<eos> You're white as fuck.<eos> I'm sure you tried your best.<eos> It just didn't...
Ah...<eos> she shut me down.<eos> She's a real company woman.<eos> I think you can move the needle here, Tyler.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - What?<eos> She likes him?<eos> She thinks he's sweet.<eos> What did she say about me?<eos> She didn't...
You brought this on yourself, you know.<eos> Is this how you roll now?<eos> Tough love?<eos> You handcuffed the Morrigan to her bed for a Kodak moment.<eos> You sure this has nothing to do with your Fae United Nations experiment?<eos> A Light cop partnered with a Dark cop?<eos> Really?<eos> It's cynicism like that has kept our sides from building a genuine peace.<eos> Also, why do you care who Dyson is paired with?<eos> - I don't.
- Still alive and singing.<eos> Along with the other Twi-hards.<eos> Dyson and his new partner.<eos> Oh!<eos> Now this is getting interesting.<eos> Three of my favorite people, trapped in one place... with no way to defend themselves.<eos> And she's got The Ash's play stick.<eos> You want to prove your loyalty to the Dark?<eos> Finish off the teen trio, and bring me the Staff of Righteousness.<eos> And if I do?
Now come on.<eos> What d'you say?<eos> Jamie!<eos> Jamie!<eos> Why would I want to do this?<eos> Look, the world is knackered and you can do something about it.<eos> I don't know what you're on about.<eos> Waldo has got the attention of the young, and the young don't give a shit about anything except trainers and pirating films.<eos> Do you have any other astounding theories about young people?<eos> Yeah, yeah I do actually.
What if I tell you stuff and you don't let me see Joe?<eos> Character, Jordy.<eos> I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.<eos> What if I tell you stuff and you don't like the stuff I tell you?<eos> Do I still get to see Joe?<eos> Just talk to me, Jordy.<eos> I'll let you see Joe.<eos> I don't know where the kid is.<eos> Oh, come on, Jordy.<eos> I don't.
It wasn't you, was it...<eos> Ok, right, stop it...<eos> Please stop talking about this, stop!<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Look, we need to get Ana Maria to a doctor.<eos> I have no idea how bad those injuries might be,... so when... when the storm lets up, leave us here and you and Ramon need to hike into town.<eos> - What about you? - I'll be fine.<eos> Look, if my dad has to push me in a wheelchair down the aisle, We are still getting married.<eos> What is your doll's name?<eos> Don't do that.
- I don't know.<eos> - What was he thinking?<eos> Well, he obviously wasn't thinking that they would use his sperm so much.<eos> And he obviously wasn't thinking that they would choose his profile so often.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Yeah, do you have a stroller for 533 children?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
Figured you'd want these back.<eos> They were just gathering dust.<eos> You read them?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Why not? Everyone else has.<eos> They're not mine to read.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> Did you mean what you said about Bob not coming back for you?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I love them.<eos> But I still don't understand what this has to do with you dropping out of school.<eos> This was my dad's way of telling me to--to--to drop the econ major and focus on what I actually love.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe he's telling you to have a hobby.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Read it.<eos> "It is only passion that makes life worth living.<eos> "I found my passion too late in life,<eos> "but when I did,
Well... well, yeah, a little.<eos> Ah.<eos> You haven't changed a bit.<eos> Oh, come on, Megan.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> You don't get to tell me how to be or... or act or... dress.<eos> I just wanted to ask you to dinner, and I thought you'd say no.<eos> You were right.<eos> Heard you struck out last night.<eos> How did you...
Nothing to see.<eos> No explosions here.<eos> You and you...<eos> Sorry, mouse.<eos> Your dad just asked me for ice and referred to me as the "oriental maid""<eos> yeah, that sounds like Harlan.<eos> And you...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Now what went wrong?<eos> What didn't?
Relax.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> (Sighs)<eos> So what happened?<eos> You are the last person I wanna talk to about it.<eos> Well...<eos> I do care about you, Maggie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If you mean it.<eos> Oh. (Exhales) Of course I do.
Hey, Bradshaw!<eos> Saved you a seat.<eos> There he was... my bad boy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Of course, yeah.<eos> I've been sitting here, waiting for you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I don't know what we're doing tomorrow.<eos> I didn't know we were doing anything.<eos> Well, now you do.
No. What's tragic is someone who can't be alone.<eos> I don't have that problem.<eos> Me, either, but I'm me.<eos> I'm always the best thing in the room.<eos> Without a hot guy like Walt, you're just positively average.<eos> When you see me on the dance floor, you will take that back.<eos> Oh. That's so pathetic.<eos> I can already see you dancing with your sad little girlfriends.<eos> I know they won't have dates either.<eos> Actually, they do.
- I'm here patrolling the dance, Maggie.<eos> God, I wish I wasn't the one to have to tell you this.<eos> Donna's trying to hurt us.<eos> "We" don't exist anymore.<eos> - So now what?<eos> - Now you're my boyfriend.<eos> You do like her, right?<eos> I know you like her.<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Zoinks.<eos> So what if he's in three sports?<eos> He's not that tall.<eos> How good could he be?<eos> He's the best point guard Castlebury's ever had.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> School newspaper.<eos> Don't you read it?<eos> Did you know he takes his math courses<eos> I did not.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to make a living doing something like that?<eos> It's almost impossible.<eos> I-I don't want her to be disappointed.<eos> She can do it as a...<eos> A hobby.<eos> But what if writing is her calling?<eos> If you don't let Carrie explore the world and figure out what she wants to be, she'll never become the person she's supposed to be...<eos> Someone who's happy and loves who she is.<eos> Don't you want that for her?<eos> Of course I do, but...
He's that photographer.<eos> She directed that movie.<eos> He's dating Madonna.<eos> And you...<eos> You're on the list.<eos> Can I take this home and frame it?<eos> The real celebrities here tonight are the writers...<eos> Jay McInerney.<eos> You read "bright lights, big city," right?<eos> Who didn't?
No, you didn't.<eos> I should've left right away.<eos> I knew you were upset.<eos> I could see it.<eos> What happened?<eos> What always happens.<eos> Something came up.<eos> Something always comes up.<eos> I don't understand why your mother hurts you like this.<eos> Yeah, I don't either, Carrie.
Muscles and guys punching each other?<eos> Mr. T.?<eos> (Laughs) Yes, please.<eos> - Okay. - (Chuckles)<eos> You're a really nice guy, Walt.<eos> Really thoughtful.<eos> Just doin' my job.<eos> Or the job you made me do.<eos> I hope Maggie knows how special you are.<eos> She does.
The question is, what are you going to do now?<eos> Eat a grilled cheese.<eos> Don't be obtuse.<eos> I mean with Carrie.<eos> You do like her, right?<eos> I know you like her.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, good for you.<eos> So what have you been up to besides missing me like crazy?<eos> Ah, not much.<eos> My mom split again.<eos> She's back with Lucas.<eos> I think my parents are done for good this time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Although that's what you wanted, right?<eos> (Mouth full) Yeah. It's better this way, believe me.<eos> I do.
If you don't let go, you can find yourself in a dark place...<eos> Unable to kick your worst habits.<eos> And sometimes, if we truly love someone, we have to be okay with letting go.<eos> So... what I said about the gym yesterday...<eos> I'm not sure i was totally being fair.<eos> You are entitled to your feelings... about the gym.<eos> But you like it, and it makes you happy.<eos> And I know mom would want that.<eos> And it's not like Dorrit and i don't want you to have a, uh... gym membership.<eos> We do.
I'm not.<eos> You're my half-sister, Emma.<eos> And despite it all, if you and Sutton hadn't been asking those questions... we never would've found each other.<eos> What do you want, Sutton?<eos> The truth.<eos> That's ironic.<eos> All right, I deserve that.<eos> I think Emma knows something about Theresa's disappearance and Derek's murder, and she won't tell me what it is.<eos> If you think I know something, you're wrong.<eos> I don't.
Everything's wrong.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Whatever it is, I'm on your side.<eos> You can trust me... with anything.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> I have to go.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> No, I don't.
Whatever it is, I'm on your side.<eos> You can trust me... with anything.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> I have to go.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you.<eos> And your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.<eos> - Wait.<eos> He did?
She's got that whole nerdy geisha thing going on.<eos> Oh, my Hermes scarf.<eos> Hermes, for real?<eos> It was a gift from these rich parents of one of my students.<eos> It always made me feel just so Jackie O.<eos> I doubt Jackie O pranced around like that.<eos> Oh, look, don't you laugh.<eos> You wore this almost as much as I did.<eos> - What, no... no, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Why not?<eos> Because I don't wanna let them down.<eos> By dying?<eos> By leaving before they're ready.<eos> I wanna make sure all my loose ends are tied up.<eos> I wanna make sure there's a plan in place, so everyone will be okay.<eos> And what about you?<eos> - What about me? - Well, you.<eos> Where do you fit into this plan?<eos> I don't.
- I know what you're doing.<eos> - What?<eos> The last time you grew out your beard was for ultimate frisbee in college.<eos> You spent two years looking like a freak because you thought, if you shaved, your team would lose.<eos> And we didn't, for two whole years.<eos> You're caught up in some superstitious O.C.D. thing, and it's not gonna work for me.<eos> I'm dying, Sean.<eos> And growing beards and wishing on shooting stars is not gonna change that.<eos> Y... you don't know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Okay.<eos> I am taking one Tolke to the hospital and the other to the bus station.<eos> Oh, dad.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna drive down next weekend to see you, okay?<eos> I'll bring some of that medicine with me.<eos> - I got plenty. - [Chuckling] Oh.<eos> I would love that.<eos> Please do it sober.
Well, one day last week,<eos> I sneak in a few pops on the job, get a little loaded, and fall asleep behind some crates.<eos> I wake up around midnight, hearing things.<eos> I peek out and there's the boss himself and that weird, quiet dude with the bow ties carrying something wrapped up in a tarp.<eos> I hid while they fed it to the shredder.<eos> And when they left, I found that down in the blood gutter.<eos> I kept it.<eos> Kind of like insurance.<eos> - You saw Proctor himself?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
I am good as new.<eos> Dyson, what happened between us...<eos> it can't happen again.<eos> You can't survive off of Lauren alone.<eos> And I will talk to her about that, but... you and me...<eos> with our history...<eos> I mean, obviously you can't feel anything anymore, but... It's still hurtful...<eos> to Lauren.<eos> You understand... right?<eos> - Of course I do.
What a swizz! All I got was a bunch of carrots, four beetroots and a cabbage.<eos> Aw. You must let me make it up to you!<eos> And please let's get a takeaway.<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> You should have told me the truth.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I thought you'd look to the life you could have had, and wish that Diana had never given you up.<eos> Is that what you really think of me?<eos> Diana has a gift for making people love her.<eos> She always did.
Phone calls out to both of them.<eos> Just covering all our bases here, Lydia.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Christopher wailed all night.<eos> [ Sighs ] I finally know why babies are shaken.<eos> Why don't you let me see a picture of your handsome, little devil?<eos> You saw the picture on my desk.<eos> You don't have a picture of your baby on your phone?<eos> No, I don't.
But your sur ...<eos> You've changed it?<eos> Right, right!<eos> Thank you very much for calling Great, just, just wonderful<eos> Unfortunately, as you know your father has passed away.<eos> Yes six weeks ago<eos> Actually in this office we're charged with tracing the relatives of those who passed away in the Borough and failing ...<eos> Yes, your father ...<eos> No, no no, there's no obligation for the next of kin to pay for the funeral<eos> No, you don't
Indeed!<eos> Indeed, my boy!<eos> Not bad, you're lucky!<eos> Leaving?<eos> -Yes.<eos> I do my work.<eos> But I will not be late.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Do not do that<eos> Do not do that
-Yeah.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> -We're fresh meat.<eos> No doubt. [ both laugh ]<eos> Usher: Oh, here he comes.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Y'all working out your strategy for today?<eos> Our strategy is to beat adam.<eos> You want to join us?<eos> Yes, I do. [ laughter ]
Right. [ laughs ]<eos> Tennessee.<eos> Come on.<eos> [ laughs ] and he's from there.<eos> That's what's really sad about it.<eos> It's one of the 60 states.<eos> Shut up. [ laughs ]<eos> I think they've said enough, danielle.<eos> I did say that, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
I blew it.<eos> I don't expect you to understand or to forgive me.<eos> My behavior was inexcusable.<eos> All I'm asking is that we figure out a way to work together.<eos> Our work here is important.<eos> You know, I keep replaying that night in my head.<eos> It's like you were two completely different people.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Well, then how the hell do you expect me to pretend it never happened?<eos> I don't.
- We're different people.<eos> - I'm not a scientist, Jason.<eos> I'm just a guy who's helped scores of people learn how to deal...<eos> Coming through.<eos> With multiple personalities.<eos> And the fundamental lesson-- the one that you refuse to hear is this-- you and Ian are part of a whole.<eos> You need to work together if you're ever gonna peacefully coexist.<eos> How can I do that?<eos> I don't know anything about stolen cars and drug money.<eos> Yes, you do.

Did you ever imagine we'd both end up as neurosurgeons back then?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - [Chuckles]<eos> I always wanted this... as long as I can remember.<eos> Ah, usual departmental B.S. But overall, no complaints.<eos> You know, I worked with a guy who did a spinal fellowship there a few years ago.<eos> Jason Cole.<eos> You know him?<eos> Of course I know him.<eos> Everybody did.
Domingo Hemingway!<eos> As I live and breathe, the Ghost of Christmas Past.<eos> Mr Fontaine.<eos> Call me Ivan.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov, like the old days.<eos> I never called you Ivan Anatoli in the old days.<eos> Well, you will now.<eos> Do you hunt, Dom?<eos> No, I don't, Ivan.
Fantastic.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Everyone sit.<eos> Get comfortable, please.<eos> Because you so enjoyed the rabbit, Dom,<eos> I have a real treat for you.<eos> Isn't she great, Dom?<eos> She likes singing almost as much as she likes my money.<eos> You know I could have killed you for saying what you did today, Dom?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The son's worse than the father.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shit, Dickie.<eos> But Fontaine ain't exactly hiring, is he?<eos> All right, son?<eos> Dom, Dom Hemingway.<eos> I didn't think I'd recognise you...<eos> Seeing as I was barely a teenager and everything.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - But I did.
Thank you.<eos> Uh...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um,The Menemy, my Ophelia Robins.<eos> How men devastate your vagina and suck out your will to live.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Catchy.<eos> You think my utter hatred of men is very extreme, don't you?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - I don't.
Uh...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um,The Menemy, my Ophelia Robins.<eos> How men devastate your vagina and suck out your will to live.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Catchy.<eos> You think my utter hatred of men is very extreme, don't you?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - I don't.<eos> I do. Yeah, I do.
She gave me a hug and she wrote inside my book.<eos> She said "Love, Selena."<eos> Lucy, if this meant so much to you, why didn't you just ask me to take you?<eos> You normally ask my permission to do things like this.<eos> Well, usually, you're not acting so weird.<eos> You think I'm acting weird?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You would never have let me cut school anyway.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Kurt, are you crying?<eos> Um... no, no.<eos> - I didn't know you wore contacts.<eos> - Yes, Rachel, I just found out I have a slight astigmatism.<eos> ADAM: Oh, I think I might have some solution in my bag.<eos> - No, no, I'm fine.<eos> I'll be good.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - I would've thought that you were crying because you and Blaine used to talk about how this was your dream to sing this song to each other at your wedding.<eos> Did we?
He dumped me when he went off to live at a college he doesn't go to.<eos> From a distance, Puck is super hot, but you don't really realize until you're right up close how puffy he is.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Here you go.<eos> I don't know why I have such terrible luck with guys.<eos> It's probably because I come on really strong and pretend to be all slutty, and then I freeze up right away and get distant and drop weird hints that my vagina has teeth.<eos> But I didn't come here to talk about the razor-sharp barbs guarding my cervix.<eos> I noticed how withdrawn you got this week in Glee Club after you told everyone your secret.<eos> It may have seemed like no one else in that room understood what you went through, but...<eos> I did.
Where is she?<eos> (school bell rings)<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you can try that, but my uncle Julius is an attorney and we will sue you right back.<eos> No, I don't need a night to think about it.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Look, I cannot believe what just happened. Who was that?<eos> Just my useless "producer."<eos> I thought you liked him.<eos> I did.
Is this him?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, he wants to do me, but we're just friends.<eos> Sam.<eos> Jan.<eos> Would you excuse us for just a moment?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I don't.
Because if I keep going with this, no one's going to be taking algebra.<eos> I'm going to change things around here.<eos> Around where? Around school, the entire school system.<eos> I'm gonna get algebra removed from the school curriculum.<eos> Well, unless you're going to make that to happen by Monday, I suggest you get on over to Kathy's and get some help with that midterm.<eos> What's the worst that can happen if I just fail algebra?<eos> I mean, I should fail, otherwise there's no point to my efforts to get algebra removed from schools.<eos> Ethan, I... I agree with you in that requiring all students to take algebra could possibly keep a student who's bad at algebra from succeeding in school overall.<eos> And even though algebra is used by accountants, financial planners, engineers, physicists, and a lot of occupations, not everyone does get algebra and not everyone uses it in their adult life.<eos> But some people do.
But speaking from experience, all I can tell you is do not marry someone you're not madly in love with.<eos> Ricky's the nice guy now, and it's hard to tell a nice guy no, but nice guys know when they're being used and if you're not madly in love with Ricky, you're using him.<eos> So end it nicely while you still can.<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you tell Kathy she looks like a stripper?<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you back from France?<eos> Did you?<eos> Did Kathy tell you that I trapped Don?<eos> His father did.
We didn't speak much.<eos> I'll see how things turn out.<eos> Be more self-conscious, yes, I know, darling, but...<eos> Agreed.<eos> I kiss you goodnight.<eos> It's prettier with a sandbox and a swing.<eos> I liked it more before.<eos> You know there's been a murder here?<eos> Does that ring a bell?<eos> It does.
I hear he got himself elected to the Senate?<eos> It's always been his big dream.<eos> He's even got a weekly meeting at the White House.<eos> Smart man.<eos> Great.<eos> So, what did he want?<eos> Oh, he just wants to know how you're...<eos> What you're doing.<eos> Mm. Yeah. Tell him I write.<eos> I did.
Yeah, if you want.<eos> She might not want to come back with him.<eos> Why did she cry at the restaurant?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> I called Shahryar.<eos> He said she burst into tears.<eos> She's never this late.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> You hadn't told her you were pregnant?<eos> You did?
-I want to go back to Marie's.<eos> We have to go home for now.<eos> You told me our home was there, forever.<eos> Yes, but some things have changed.<eos> It's because of the man who came? No.<eos> Because I misbehaved yesterday? No...<eos> Why doesn't Lucie like you?<eos> She thinks I want to take her mommy away.<eos> She doesn't like her mommy.<eos> Of course she does. All children do.
Why?<eos> You have one on your head.<eos> Yeah, on top of my head, like a normal person.<eos> What is the difference?<eos> Just move on.<eos> If you enter that room, you could break the bond we have created.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just please, please trust me on this one.<eos> Do you understand how important this is?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Vivian's contact and baby daddy are the same guy... Ben Preswick.<eos> Whoever killed Vivian is probably looking for him too.<eos> We better get him first.<eos> The death of heiress and party girl Vivian Bowers has officially been ruled a homicide by the Manhattan district attorney's office.<eos> The NYPD has declined...<eos> Look at this guy.<eos> He just hit that Asian chick and just sped off.<eos> Edward's definitely feeling the pressure from the homicide ruling.<eos> He hits that reporter solid, that's his third murder.<eos> For sure that rich hump did Vivian.
If your fiancée wins the election, does that make you the First Lady of Providence?<eos> See, I know you're mocking me, but it actually has a nice ring to it.<eos> I got to say.<eos> Hi, Henry!<eos> Elijah!<eos> Hey, Henry.<eos> I know it's early, but I think we should go fishing today.<eos> Now, I don't have any fishing equipment, but I do have some M-80s that I found downstairs.<eos> I think they still work.<eos> They do.
You're gonna wear that fishing?<eos> No, I'm wearing this to work.<eos> I thought you were taking time off.<eos> I did. Two whole days.<eos> What, Saturday and Sunday?<eos> That's a weekend.<eos> Everyone takes that off.<eos> Yeah, you guys know how it is.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> No, you don't.
James Ulysses Goodwin, you get back.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> Jimmy... Wait.<eos> Jimmy?<eos> Jimmy, just...<eos> Yes, I know I said it was a simple procedure, but I didn't want to alarm you. Henry, uh,...<eos> The truth is...<eos> Henry? ...your husband had a very slim chance of survival, and he's a lucky man.<eos> Surgery's not till next week?<eos> Well, then, who did I...?
It's fine.<eos> Another one-night stand, Jimmy?<eos> You and her?<eos> You had sex with her? Did you?<eos> You didn't.<eos> Did you? Did you?<eos> Damn it!<eos> You did?<eos> You didn't, did you?<eos> No, you didn't, did you?
Kendrick Mantorov is either your killer or a possible target.<eos> Getting close to him makes sense.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Fine!<eos> All right.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Buck and Wanda Moosejaw.<eos> We want to dance to the top.<eos> Yeah, everybody does.
In one primitive tribe, the mothers would kill other young females who were perceived to be threats.<eos> Why are you telling me that?<eos> I have a lot of fun stories like that-<eos> - I'm Wanda.<eos> Laila.<eos> Buck and I are doing the rumba.<eos> Ooh...<eos> It's a very sexual dance.<eos> Well, I guess I know who my competition is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Likes to roost near water.<eos> Would that be the black oyster-catcher or the long-billed curlew?<eos> Hermit thrush.<eos> You, I like.<eos> Conditionally.<eos> How about you, Cross?<eos> You here to watch the birds or just steal them?<eos> You know what, I think it's about time you and I straightened out this whole misunderstanding.<eos> You did not pioneer photonic circuitry.<eos> I did.
He dodges it like a bullet.<eos> Huh.<eos> A kid from the streets lying to an adult he just met.<eos> That never happens.<eos> You need to be more careful around him.<eos> He's 15 and homeless.<eos> He's withdrawn, guarded, mistrustful.<eos> Three of my best friends at that age.<eos> And I get that you wanna protect him.<eos> I do.
You remember me.<eos> That's good.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Uhh!<eos> Children shouldn't play with guns.<eos> - Uhh!<eos> - Ohh!<eos> How'd you kill your bodyguard?<eos> I didn't.
You sure are pretty, Miss.<eos> Strange thing to say with him gone!<eos> It's Sarah, our lovely Sarah.<eos> - What the fuck is this?<eos> - Oh, come on! Your brother's girlfriend!<eos> Silly me.<eos> Francis smokes these on special occasions.<eos> But he'll share, won't he?<eos> And you can smoke inside.<eos> My husband did from '71 to 2001, so the smell...
I'm trying to avoid them.<eos> - Is that first class in there?<eos> - It's just a perk of the job.<eos> Just cos you're in first class, it doesn't make you a first-class person.<eos> He's all right.<eos> I think he needs a good swipe of shite.<eos> Yes, you're probably right.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Washington Dulles Airport.<eos> Martin, did you have a little chocolate on your pillow?<eos> Yes, I did, yes.
- "Hello."<eos> - He was polite.<eos> Well... Now, well, he was smart, and he had a firm handshake.<eos> - He said hello, which was nice.<eos> - He said hello. Hello.<eos> - He was polite.<eos> - Oh, Martin!<eos> I... knew your son for about ten years.<eos> He was senior legal counsel to both the Reagan and Bush administrations.<eos> He didn't do too badly, did he, Philomena?
You take some time.<eos> You think about it.<eos> Till then, you got your wish.<eos> You're riding with a senior guy.<eos> Lucero, right?<eos> First name's Henry.<eos> Just call me Hank.<eos> You transferred in.<eos> You don't know the streets.<eos> I do.
Yes, really.<eos> Do you know when they made the first Super Snake?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> 1967.<eos> You know why they made it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, so Carroll Shelby could, uh, test out new tires.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know how many they made?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Lydia:<eos> Take your time.<eos> Well...<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> I raped him -- up the asshole.<eos> You raped -- raped him?<eos> Uh...<eos> Okay, I'm -<eos> - I'm -- when -- when you say "rape,"<eos> what exactly do -- Oh.
You said "all right"?<eos> No, I didn't mean all right.<eos> You said "all right."<eos> No, I know I said, "all right," but I didn't mean all right.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna call my wife right now.<eos> I'm gonna call her ri--<eos> Help me!<eos> Please help me!<eos> Please, please!<eos> I didn't even -- please!
Y-you can't lie.<eos> Good boys don't lie.<eos> Surprised you came.<eos> It must have been hard.<eos> I used to pray for you.<eos> Had my prayers been answered, none of this would have ever happened.<eos> Can only imagine how you suffered because of what I did.<eos> I've thought about it a lot.<eos> Know this, John.<eos> I did my share of suffering, too.
I don't know what I can say.<eos> I told them all I could remember.<eos> I want to do something else.<eos> It's gonna feel weird, but...<eos> I want to see if I can get you to look at this from another perspective.<eos> Can you imagine you're a video camera looking down on yourself?<eos> The house, everything that happened?<eos> Don't be in it, be above it.<eos> And then tell me if you can see anything new.<eos> No, I don't -- I don't, uh...
I'd rather have only kissed one boy than give mouth-to-south resuscitation to someone twice my age in a Vauxhall Nova on a bit of scrubland behind a SPAR.<eos> Don't make me feel bad just cos I've got a boyfriend and you haven't.<eos> Do you know, you're always making me feel guilty for having things.<eos> You think I've got it so easy, Rae, and you've got no idea what it's like to have to walk into a room and have everyone look at you.<eos> All of the time.<eos> I do know what it feels like... to walk into a room and have everybody stare at me.<eos> Do you know that every time we talk to boys... they're not talking to us, they're talking to you?<eos> Whatever, Rae!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Of course you don't, Princess Chloe.
Oh, Karim... my beastie.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Aw!<eos> I want him to feel at home tonight, OK?<eos> So let's all show him how we party in Lincolnshire!<eos> We've both...<eos> Yeah, we've had quite a difficult time recently, so it's, um, it's really nice that we've got something we can all celebrate... together.<eos> Does anyone else want to say anything?<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, dinner was great.<eos> Richard was great.<eos> He was funny and sweet and he wants to take me to Santa Barbara and he wants to tell the girls we're together and...<eos> Oh, you're telling Lucy?<eos> No, I haven't decided.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because it's a huge decision, and I'm not sure if Lucy's ready.<eos> And why are we even talking about Richard right now?<eos> I just saw my dead husband.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- right?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It was not pretty.<eos> I think the kid had to get, like, 29 stitches - or something. - Oh.<eos> Oh, we've had some funny stories.<eos> So why did you stop being a cop?<eos> Mm. You know, when you're there every day, you see so much. And if you don't practice some level of detachment, then you can't up and do it the next day.<eos> You know? I'm sure you know a little something about that.<eos> I do.
But the great thing?<eos> I kept it for years.<eos> The only secret I kept longer was the one about Travis and his second grade girlfriend-- this blonde gal named Erin, who, turns out, wasn't a girl.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> They actually kissed.<eos> I-I just don't know why you're so upset.<eos> Because when we met, I was a successful attorney.<eos> Jules, I used to make judges cry.<eos> They called me "Tiger Bitch."<eos> Grayson still does.
- You didn't ask any questions.<eos> - Megan.<eos> No. That's okay.<eos> I was a soldier, and war teaches you to not ask what you do not need to know.<eos> It's never worked for me.<eos> We were hoping she mentions who her pimp was.<eos> This is from the girl to her mother, um, begging for forgiveness, wanting to come home.<eos> She signs it "Oksana Svetlova."<eos> I hope this helps.<eos> Oh, yeah, it does.
Let's go and get ready.<eos> Okay, so now I'm impressed.<eos> You like?<eos> I love.<eos> Is this her?<eos> Your wife?<eos> A year before she died.<eos> You loved her.<eos> I can hear it in your voice.<eos> I still do.
I like it, the music.<eos> Nice choice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I think this one must be yours.<eos> I know, I thought we'd swap.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, would you want your daughter coming up to the flat of a man she just met, drinking from a glass he gave her?<eos> - You put something in my wine.<eos> - What?<eos> - You did.
Sebastian went to meet him somewhere, with the scangen.<eos> A crime scene?<eos> I guess so.<eos> How come no one ever tells me anything?<eos> All I know for sure is that there's a dead woman.<eos> And if it's who I think it is, it's not going to be from natural causes.<eos> Who do you think it is?<eos> Someone I know... intimately.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> But how do you...
Eat it!<eos> I can't. I can't. I can't.<eos> I can't. I can't. I can't.<eos> Okay, everyone, I have an announcement!<eos> - This whole thing...<eos> - Bill, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.<eos> Uh, before you make that announcement, you had something else you wanted to say, remember?<eos> You wanted Ders here to admit that Wayne's World is a better movie than Austin Powers, or he'll kill him!<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yes, you did.
Theresa, and the twins.<eos> What are you talking about, twins?<eos> There's another Sutton, and her name's Emma.<eos> See ya, Thayer.<eos> THAYER: Sutton.<eos> Well, this changes everything.<eos> Back in my room, before the sirens,<eos> I asked you for the truth.<eos> I... I don't even remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
But you came to town, and you destroyed a family.<eos> - You did nothing but tear us apart.<eos> - I didn't handle it right.<eos> Yeah, you sure as hell didn't.<eos> Emma?<eos> You know what, no.<eos> I have to ask you something, and I've been wanting to ask it ever since I found out you were my mother.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you even look at us before you let Alec take us away?<eos> Yes, I did.
Can't take it.<eos> I didn't know if I should have hugged her or slapped her.<eos> You didn't believe her, did you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Emma, are you insane?<eos> You cannot go soft like this.<eos> She's our mother.<eos> I...<eos> I want to believe that at some point, she loved us.<eos> Well, of course she did.
(computer beeps)<eos> It's Rebecca.<eos> Look at you two.<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> God, this is so far from how I imagined we'd...<eos> Where are you?<eos> I can't...<eos> Sutton, we were so close to having everything that we dreamed of... until it went so wrong.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you killed two people.<eos> No, I didn't.
That remind you of anything?<eos> I'd say there's a jade elephant in the room.<eos> Pete?<eos> The window.<eos> Carson!<eos> Carson's still got the elephant.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> This is Oliver Carson, and he's dead.<eos> All right, well, whoever killed Carson has the elephant.<eos> Either way, we don't.
Ah, rain check, sweetheart.<eos> I promise.<eos> Great.<eos> They don't have star-69 or caller ID in the '40s.<eos> And this is why you should watch movies.<eos> Operator.<eos> Say, doll, what's your name?<eos> Doris.<eos> Ah, I love that name.<eos> No, no, I really do.
Doris.<eos> Ah, I love that name.<eos> No, no, I really do.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> Sultry voice, intoxicating laugh-- you're a redhead.<eos> No, what do they say about redheads?<eos> Jeepers, I'd like to find out if that's true.<eos> Uh... Say, Doris, maybe you can help me out.<eos> Any chance you listened in on the last call?<eos> Maybe--I don't know-- something about an elephant?
I can be a real ice queen.<eos> Congratulations on the baby.<eos> You and your wife must be so happy.<eos> Oh, that's not my wife.<eos> I am free as a bird.<eos> Do you-Ya, I'm kind of talked out.<eos> She's a home wrecker.<eos> Home demolition contractor.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.
There was nothing I could've done for any of them!<eos> Tell me she's lying.<eos> Tell me this isn't you.<eos> He was going to expose me.<eos> You stood to lose everything.<eos> So you stole drugs from the hospital, you incapacitated him, and you killed him, because he knew.<eos> What did he know?<eos> He walked into a movie halfway through, watched two minutes, and he had an opinion?<eos> About ethnic cleansing?<eos> The whole world does.
Occasionally, a Russian hooker comes through, but those girls are nasty and they cry a lot.<eos> Transporting one to I-S 1 2.<eos> All these offenders want a piece of me, Bennett.<eos> You know why?<eos> It's the fucking pheromones, man.<eos> You get 'em all locked up like this for a long time, and they get this prehistoric yearning for man-stink.<eos> They fucking hate my guts, you know?<eos> But they can't help themselves.<eos> I'm musty and they love it.<eos> You don't really...
I've got a helicopter to take you to nearest landing strip.<eos> Local PD will assist you, and the Albany Field Office is on standby.<eos> You will stay in contact with me at all times.<eos> You understand?<eos> Agent Weston, that was for your benefit.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Sign here.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the constitution...<eos> - et cetera, et cetera?<eos> - I do.
I was worried sick.<eos> You said I could call my mom.<eos> - Did you mean it?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You can call her whenever you want.<eos> You found him.<eos> Where were you, squirt?<eos> Huh? You had us worried.<eos> I didn't find him.<eos> Some friendly neighbors back there did.
Oh, hey, uh, I'm late for a conference call.<eos> Can you deliver this to Dom immediately, please?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No problem at all.<eos> Great.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I don't believe you!<eos> No, Miranda thinks you're dead!<eos> She doesn't.
Guess I'm taking that personal day after all.<eos> Why don't everybody just go home?<eos> Bye, Lace.<eos> Did you make up with Grandma yet?<eos> We don't make up, honey.<eos> We endure.<eos> I know things with you two can get complicated.<eos> I know you're mad at Grandma because she never talks about Grandpa.<eos> But you don't talk about him, either.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Yes, I do.
It's in the back.<eos> If we knew someone else who had a phone, we could call them.<eos> And since we are celebrating... ..I had this delivered from Rackham's Department Store.<eos> Will you open it?<eos> No.<eos> Save it for a special occasion.<eos> Right, your first job for the company.<eos> I want you to get that to my sister.<eos> I don't see her?<eos> No-one does.
These are just my knock-around heels.<eos> (School bell rings)<eos> Kim?<eos> Hi.<eos> James Van Der Beek, celebrity mentor you requested.<eos> James Van Der Beek?<eos> I asked for Mario Van Peebles.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> I don't even know who you are. Dang!<eos> Sure you do.
I know, I know, but now Gray Leverson's falling like shit and I'm supposed to be up there selling.<eos> Right now I'm supposed to be making a move.<eos> So, why aren't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> - Or I'm just shit.<eos> - No, you're not shit.<eos> - You know something, don't you?<eos> - No, I don't.
Right now I'm supposed to be making a move.<eos> So, why aren't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> - Or I'm just shit.<eos> - No, you're not shit.<eos> - You know something, don't you?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
No, but I do have one...<eos> Why?<eos> I-I was trying to be nice.<eos> Try again.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I've got this friend who is always getting into trouble, you know, dragging everybody down, and he's got this horrible habit of just disappearing, leaving everyone else to clean up all his messes.<eos> So I-I-I guess I just learned how to do that.<eos> How'd you know it was me?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Jordan did.
I think Charlie was gonna meet you the night she snuck out of rehab.<eos> She wanted drugs, you wanted sex, things got a little weird.<eos> You didn't mean to hurt her, but you did.<eos> So you took her body to the park, made it look like a random drug deal.<eos> No-- Just another model with a coke habit.<eos> No.<eos> None of--none-- none of that happened.<eos> No.<eos> That's not true, okay?<eos> I don't...
I... i... it may have looked that way, but, uh, in fact, to be clear, I'm for less...<eos> In the Watershed Bill, the language clearly stated... it didn't pass.<eos> Well, right.<eos> That's what I'm asking about.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Why it didn't pass.<eos> I just said.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I don't think you did.<eos> It just didn't.
How about...<eos> How about this?<eos> You let us build a case against Ketchum.<eos> You know it's not that simple.<eos> There's a process. Yeah!<eos> But the process is broken!<eos> So if you hand this case over to I.A., you're facilitating it.<eos> You need to pick a side!<eos> I think you need to calm down, detective.<eos> Oh, I do.
I don't know.<eos> It just sort of came to you, didn't it?<eos> No, you rejected a lot of things.<eos> And we can't shoot one of the things I rejected?<eos> We just don't have the time.<eos> Look, my job is to introduce your headphones to a huge, drunk, male audience.<eos> And it's not about my work, it's about making a great ad.<eos> The association not being with Vietnam, but with a laugh, a smile, that all comes from your headphones.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> But I do.
Is he no longer with us?<eos> When he was around 40, he developed pancreatic cancer.<eos> By the time they found it, the tumor had metastasized to the liver.<eos> They gave him chemo, but... it was just a waiting game.<eos> The kids both offered to look after him, but he wouldn't hear of it.<eos> In those last months, he seemed more peaceful than I'd ever seen him.<eos> And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No one did.
What about Kimber's men?<eos> I thought he had his own protection.<eos> Kimber's let his troops go rotten.<eos> They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.<eos> We are going to show Kimber how it should be done.<eos> Now take what you're good at.<eos> Those of you with guns, keep them out of it, unless a gun is pulled on you.<eos> We want this done quietly.<eos> So when do we share out the cash?<eos> We don't.
Do you know any funny anecdotes?<eos> Babe, I got this.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I mean, what do you mean, you "got this"?<eos> I'm just gonna talk about my body.<eos> People love it when I talk about my body.<eos> Ryan, no, don't talk about your body.<eos> People do not wanna hear you talk about your body.<eos> - We're on in five... four...<eos> - They do.
Olivia Leland.<eos> The murder?<eos> That case was solved years ago.<eos> By Detective Sakelik.<eos> You might want to look into the case again.<eos> Look into the Leland case.<eos> You didn't have to kill Annabelle.<eos> She was going to ruin everything.<eos> Annabelle didn't want what we want.<eos> She never did.
The rush, Roslyn, is that Louis has been taken into police custody for questioning.<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe you should ask your partner.<eos> He's the one who brought Louis in.<eos> It has something to do with the Olivia Leland case.<eos> I'm sure you can imagine my, uh discomfort when Louis called me from the station.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> There's something else that worries me.<eos> Louis tells me you and he had a fight.<eos> - We did...
Fuck all of you!<eos> She's right, you know.<eos> Classic counterintelligence.<eos> I told you, I didn't plant that story.<eos> Well, it's straight from your playbook.<eos> I'm not saying it wasn't smart.<eos> Especially if things had gone south yesterday, as insurance.<eos> It wasn't me, Saul.<eos> I know you're trying to help, but I feel like you have to find a way to be more relaxed around her.<eos> We all do.
We all do.<eos> I feel like I'm doing that.<eos> You aren't.<eos> Uh, if you ask me, you're the one who's making too much of this whole thing.<eos> Too much?<eos> Of my daughter's suicide?<eos> She didn't commit suicide.<eos> She tried to very hard.<eos> Even the doctor said so.<eos> Well, of course he did.
I raised one.<eos> My God, Jessie, you talked about killing yourself once a week.<eos> I talked about it, but I never tried it.<eos> And I'm saying she didn't really mean to, either.<eos> It was a-a cry for attention.<eos> If she really meant to kill herself, she'd be dead.<eos> I hereby call this meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee to order.<eos> Mr. Berenson, in accordance with the practice of the committee, would you stand and be sworn?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Do you have your copy machine?<eos> There's one in the teacher's lounge.<eos> Great. (Whispers) But it's for teachers.<eos> Oh, I'm a teacher somewhere else, so we gotta stick together, right, guys?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here you go. I already locked them in Dr. Skrutz's office.<eos> The application process is closed.<eos> Who made up all these stupid forms anyway?<eos> You... you did.<eos> You did, Linda. Yay!
Soon.<eos> I have a little matter I need to settle first.<eos> Lady Loxley is in the Palm Court, Mr Selfridge.<eos> She wants to see you.<eos> Lady Mae.<eos> A delight to see you, as always.<eos> How are you?<eos> Feeling lonely, having argued with Tony over a large gambling debt.<eos> Oh, you know how it is, boys will be boys.<eos> No, Harry, I don't.
The window.<eos> It's beautiful, Madame.<eos> All in.<eos> Are you sure, Harry, old chap?<eos> Why aren't you at the store?<eos> I left.<eos> Who the bloody hell are you?<eos> I have certain conditions to put before you.<eos> I'm here to tell you that your husband has not been faithful to you.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
I'll get my stuff.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good hunting.<eos> So what's the deal with Stafford anyway?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He's a health commissioner.<eos> And you really should try not to antagonize the guy.<eos> Yeah, but he's kind of a tool.<eos> Why do Megan like him?<eos> Well, she didn't, at first.
Hey.<eos> That was some fancy shooting earlier.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Deep down, you're probably wondering what would've happened if I'd missed, right?<eos> No, you don't strike me as a guy who misses.<eos> You got a first name, officer Dunn?<eos> Riley.<eos> You like hockey?<eos> Sure.<eos> Who doesn't?
Wait, you sell the car to somebody else?<eos> Something like that.<eos> And then... where do they take them?<eos> Far away, across the deep blue sea.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> You just made 1,500 bucks.<eos> That's cool.<eos> And it can go up from there.<eos> You like tequila?<eos> Who doesn't?
Hey Teddy, where are we going?<eos> Fucking nowhere.<eos> On a scale of one to baked, how baked are you?<eos> Fucking baked!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Dude, what the fuck are you doing?<eos> How the fuck did you know?<eos> How did I know what? How did you know I'd get in a fucking accident?<eos> I didn't.
She never was my favorite trophy.<eos> Now why don't you two get the hell out of my home?<eos> Well, Billy did it.<eos> He killed his wife to keep his money, Then had Michelle murdered when she found evidence of it.<eos> Only how do we prove it?<eos> Well, all roads lead to Noah.<eos> So if we can catch him, we'll get him to turn on Billy.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Only we don't have any way of finding him.<eos> Actually, we do.
The hell they give me tea for?<eos> That should be mine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I haven't touched it.<eos> That farmer fella today over at Mr. Doyle's?<eos> Roly-poly Otis.<eos> I thought his name was Elmer.<eos> They're all Otis to me.<eos> Anyhow, he's got some problems.<eos> - Who does?
So we get the joy of spending every second of every day together, and I don't even save money?<eos> I also told him he could ring the bell.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're doing the temple rub.<eos> Sweetie, what can I do to make it stop?<eos> Really.<eos> I'll- - I'll do anything.<eos> You kept that job for 12 minutes.<eos> Work sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Hi. What's... what's going on?<eos> Oh, just wondering...<eos> - About?<eos> - About Ben.<eos> About Ben and why Ben is always so obsessed with you.<eos> You don't think you've done anything that Ben could maybe misinterpret as you being interested in him, have you?<eos> No!<eos> Alice, what is this about?<eos> - Do you have an E-diary?<eos> - Um, what if I do?
- We are lording.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> Who wants some?<eos> Well, if I've learned anything from the movies I've seen, blow is a delicious treat that should be consumed a bunch.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> Well, have at it.<eos> - Okay, yeah.<eos> We'll, uh... we'll do, like, a little bit, you know.<eos> We'll ride a rail... not, like, a full-blown engine train, but, like, maybe one of those little cartoon ones, like in Chip 'N Dale.<eos> Or we do a ton.
You really didn't see it?<eos> I'm losing my mind.<eos> You're not.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> You're not.<eos> Juliette?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You wanted me here.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Right now, as a matter of fact.<eos> Uh, we thought we'd missed you. I'm ready.<eos> I will meet you at the business center.<eos> Must have been delayed.<eos> That seems to happen a lot.<eos> I have a friend who... who's dying.<eos> Wants me to give the eulogy at... at his funeral.<eos> He just e-mailed me.<eos> He's dying, and he sent you an e-mail?<eos> His wife did.
I thank you for your time.<eos> It's been a good ride.<eos> I'm not letting you resign.<eos> I'm not resigning.<eos> You're firing me.<eos> Then you're gonna publically disavow me.<eos> You're gonna say that I'm a loose cannon, that I'm fit for fighting off Volge marauders but not fit to uphold the law.<eos> I'm not gonna say anything like that.<eos> You heard my words on the radio.<eos> Everyone did.
You guys kindly took me in during a very difficult time.<eos> I'm making a little money, and it is time for me to stand on my own two feet.<eos> I... am gonna start contributing to the rent.<eos> It's a bit.<eos> She's doing a bit. (Laughs)<eos> That's hysterical. (Laughs)<eos> What?<eos> Honey, you don't...<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.
And good luck with the whole Jane Goodall thing.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Well, good night, guys. Or good morning.<eos> How did I know I'd find you on here?<eos> Hey. Hey. I cleaned up the place.<eos> Huh? Oh, it looks really good.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You should come over here and help me finish this bottle of wine.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm still working.<eos> Do that later.
I...<eos> I can, I can if I wanted to.<eos> You know, Clyde, most people here think that you're just a selfish asshole.<eos> But not me, I've never thought that-- you know what I think?<eos> I think that you're a sad, deeply insecure little man, who has to tear people down just to feel better about himself.<eos> I do think that you are a good person, but I feel truly sorry for you.<eos> (Quietly): Yeah.<eos> Is this what you're like when you start getting laid, man?<eos> 'Cause honestly I don't like it.<eos> Well, I do.

Hey... you okay?<eos> Every family has its issues, right?<eos> We can talk about it.<eos> Or not talk about it?<eos> Break a few windows, set some stuff on fire.<eos> Think I just wanna take a shower.<eos> Uh, I'll scrounge up some food and we can hang out here until you're ready to go back.<eos> I'm never going back.<eos> Forgot about our secret knock.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Where is she now?<eos> - Harlem.<eos> Damn it, Joanna, she might see you.<eos> I can't believe I have to remind you that I'm a cop.<eos> We wanted to know who posted the 50 grand and bail.<eos> I see Sofia with a magic closet full of cash,<eos> - I follow her.<eos> - It doesn't make sense.<eos> As far as we know, she didn't know who Ben was.<eos> But maybe she did.
He went to see Haverstock.<eos> Stupid, impulsive...<eos> He has a right to answers.<eos> Not to this.<eos> Get me the boy.<eos> I know about Vivian.<eos> Now, my father may not have the balls to expose you.<eos> I do.<eos> You really don't want to threaten me like that.<eos> Actually, I really do.
I think I'm making this more complicated than it really is.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I just have to get used to the fact that every instinct I have is a dirty lie that will ruin everything.<eos> Look, here's a trick that I taught your father for when he needs to think things through.<eos> If you feel like you're gonna blurt something out that you shouldn't, just take a long sip of water and figure out what you're going to say.<eos> Let's practice.<eos> Spider-man can beat up Batman.<eos> Well, what an interesting opinion you have.<eos> That's it!<eos> You did it.
Shut the door forever.<eos> And walk away.<eos> Wait, w-why would I do that?<eos> Because it is the safest place on earth, warded against any evil ever created.<eos> It is impervious to any entry, except the key.<eos> Right, but then all that knowledge would be -- would be lost and gone forever.<eos> And that is the price we have to pay for keeping it away from Abbadon.<eos> You do... have the key, don't you?<eos> I don't, um...<eos> But, uh, my brother my brother does.
I mean, all those years thinking his old man ditched when the poor son of a bitch really came here and saved our bacon.<eos> Freaking time-travel, man.<eos> You think it would have made a difference?<eos> What?<eos> Dad.<eos> If he'd had his own father around.<eos> What, in how he raised us?<eos> Sammy, he did the best he could.<eos> I know that.<eos> I-I do.
You love that place.<eos> Oh. Some of my best memories were fishing off that bridge.<eos> "Ranch"? It's a tin shack on a muddy creek.<eos> Well, I appreciate the offer, but I got this.<eos> At what cost?<eos> I know what you're hiding.<eos> Riley, you can talk to me about all these things.<eos> You don't have to keep all these secrets.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, I don't know where we're going.<eos> I want it to be a surprise.<eos> Where are you taking us anyway?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> I promise, you'll all love it.<eos> We're all hanging out with the McCormacks.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - You promised we'd love it.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> - You did.
- Wh-- wh--<eos> Whoo-ooh-ooh!<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> It's pretty badass that you stopped crying.<eos> I think I may just be out of tears.<eos> Hey, why did you pick me instead of Riggs?<eos> I know people say that redheads are shady and shiftless--<eos> They do?
You really feel that way?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Look, I'm just busting your balls.<eos> That's what brothers do.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> Of course I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm proud as hell.<eos> I brag about you every chance I get-- ask anybody in the convention industry.<eos> I just figured you knew.<eos> Now I do.
You reversed it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (sighs)<eos> You know, it's very important to me that I be a strong role model for young women.<eos> My pregnancy doesn't make me any less capable.<eos> And D.B., this must be quite a change for you, too.<eos> Well, your goals are admirable, Becca.<eos> But I think what I and the American people want to know is, how are you feeling?<eos> Even role models have moments of doubt.<eos> I don't.
Yes, I am.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> (chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!<eos> Oh, no, you will not tell Tucker I don't want to go.<eos> But you don't.
On the grounds that cut it the hell out, Mom.<eos> Because you know you still do have feelings, and so does she, and I will cut it out if the two of you will just admit it.<eos> Okay, fine!<eos> We have feelings for each other!<eos> Are you happy?<eos> I'm not.<eos> How about you, Wade?<eos> You happy?<eos> (clears throat) Well, I've been better.<eos> Tansy, how-how did you...?
Caputo grilled me about inappropriate relationships for five hours today.<eos> It wasn't really five hours, but it felt that way.<eos> You know, this is inappropriate.<eos> What you and me are doing.<eos> It's gonna be fine, baby.<eos> I think we have different definitions of fine.<eos> I'm about to lose my job, and your mom was naked.<eos> Like, really, really naked.<eos> I saw her boobs.<eos> But you didn't do nothing, right?
What grows on trees? Nothing.<eos> That's right!<eos> You need to look after them better.<eos> How about you?<eos> I got better things to do.<eos> Get them a pizza if they're hungry.<eos> I'm eating oysters, bitches.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I want oysters.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, they sent us here 'cause the chapel's wrecked.<eos> Now, don't worry.<eos> You just keep on doing what you're doing.<eos> Yeah, let's see one of these downward facing doggie styles.<eos> Soft eyes, Morello. Soft eyes.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> Norma, take over for me.<eos> I'm getting Caputo.<eos> I'm sorry, am I disturbing you?<eos> Oh, man, I did it.
Though you might want to think about getting a job at some point.<eos> He has a job.<eos> He's a writer.<eos> All it takes is one article.<eos> For what?<eos> To get paid 50 bucks?<eos> To lead to bigger things.<eos> You have any projects you're working on?<eos> Yes, Mom, thank you.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
All hundreds.<eos> Not enough for what just happened.<eos> You take the cop's gun and you put it where no one will ever find it.<eos> Take it.<eos> There's a car in the driveway.<eos> - Hey. What are you doing in my place?<eos> - Did you find it?<eos> Yeah. Wasn't where you said but we got it.<eos> - What's going on? What are you doing?<eos> - What does who do?
Maybe we're spies together...<eos> Damn it, please don't listen to me.<eos> (Whispers): I'm super nervous.<eos> Hey, dad, what's up?<eos> Dad?<eos> !<eos> You said you were having trouble tracking this guy down.<eos> I just wanted you to find his phone number.<eos> You didn't tell me your dad was the president of America.<eos> Yes, I did.
I practically said the opposite of that.<eos> Well, ♪ ta-da...! ♪<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey...<eos> I'm gonna figure out what's happening.<eos> Stay right there.<eos> Skip, why?<eos> !<eos> Becca, you owe it to the American people to give this thing a shot.<eos> No, I don't.
It's good to know she's got your back.<eos> With a bayonet.<eos> This looks kinda bad, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, well, it won't once we find out what really happened.<eos> Now do you remember anything about last night, even something little? (Clicks)<eos> (Sighs) Well, I've been racking my brain.<eos> I can't think of anything that happened to Skylar, but... most bars have a surveillance camera.<eos> Right.<eos> We checked O'Connor's.<eos> They do.
I've gotta hand it to you, Spike.<eos> You did a really good job of taking care of the animals.<eos> Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect!<eos> You did such a good job fluffing his tail!<eos> Yeah, well, we're like this now.<eos> You know who.<eos> So, what are you thinking?<eos> Bake them into a jewel pie?<eos> Six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!<eos> Yeah, it does.
With pride.<eos> I saw that briefly today.<eos> He fought back.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> But you knew if word got out that you were here, it would ruin everything you came to do.<eos> I came to show you the good.<eos> I needed to protect that.<eos> An innocent man is dead.<eos> You disposed of his body, and you lied about it.<eos> Yes, I did.
You mean, when you ran away.<eos> I have... played this moment over and over in my head for years.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Alex, I wanted to contact you every day. Okay?<eos> Believe me.<eos> Every day, but... it was easier to imagine that you had some perfect husband, and three perfect kids somewhere.<eos> I wanted that in my life, once.<eos> We both did.
Why?<eos> I-I'm guessing he's with Alex.<eos> I saw you with your little soldier boyfriend.<eos> That was him, right?<eos> I bet he's gonna miss you.<eos> I've been thinking about this for a long time.<eos> Stop!<eos> I don't even know how to thank you.<eos> How did you know I'd be in trouble?<eos> I, uh... I didn't.
He cheated on her.<eos> Is that the best you can come up with?<eos> Dad wasn't the man he said he was.<eos> On "The Queen's Gambit" right before he died, he admitted to me that he failed us.<eos> You.<eos> Me.<eos> And mom.<eos> That he wasn't the man he said he was and that he just wished... he wished he had more time to right his wrongs.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Play hard to get?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> But it does work.<eos> Yeah. I'm not doing that.<eos> Kaye has no trauma or family history of epilepsy.<eos> Tox screen is negative.<eos> Electrolytes?<eos> Normal.<eos> Do you have plans tonight?<eos> I do.
And that's good.<eos> Why don't you drink?<eos> You don't really... I do.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> And I used to do oxy.<eos> I fell in love, I thought, with an addict.<eos> I don't know why I said "I thought."<eos> I mean...<eos> I do.
♪ I gotta bag it up ♪<eos> I am so thrilled to meet you because, aside from the fact that you exist,<eos> Sheldon has told me absolutely nothing about you.<eos> Well, I wouldn't take that personally.<eos> Sheldon is just afraid that I'm going to... (Clears throat) leave him.<eos> That I'm going to leave him, and then he'll have to explain how he lost such a prize.<eos> So... the less you know, the better.<eos> She doesn't filter either.<eos> No.<eos> No, she-- she doesn't.
No.<eos> OK.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you coming around here?<eos> It was Joe.<eos> Joe killed Danny Latimer.<eos> No.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> No, he didn't.
OK.<eos> Tell me what's going on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you coming around here?<eos> It was Joe.<eos> Joe killed Danny Latimer.<eos> No.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> He didn't.
Let bygones be bygones.<eos> It's a diversionary tactic.<eos> It keeps the walkers away.<eos> Didn't work so well with those two.<eos> You got a camp?<eos> It's just us.<eos> We have a town. It's walled.<eos> There's about 70 of us.<eos> You take people in?<eos> We do.
- That is not true.<eos> - And you still are.<eos> No, I am there because those people need me.<eos> And what about these people?<eos> I'm trying to save them, too.<eos> I did not realize the messiah complex was contagious.<eos> Go to hell, Michonne.<eos> He sent Merle to kill me.<eos> Would have sent him to kill you, too, if you had come with me.<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Both of 'em, most likely.<eos> You'd let that happen for a shot?<eos> You're cold as ice, Officer Friendly.<eos> You're gonna need wire, not rope.<eos> Wire.<eos> Nothing she could chew through.<eos> You know something?<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't know why I do the things I do.<eos> Never did.
Just looking for a little crystal meth.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know.<eos> Shit mess my life up when everything is going so sweet, right?<eos> You talk to Rick yet?<eos> Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm in.<eos> But, uh, he ain't got the stomach for it.<eos> He's gonna buckle.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If he does, he does.
- No.<eos> I have to.<eos> While I still can.<eos> Please?<eos> I know how the safety works.<eos> Well, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did.<eos> You did.
You don't tell us everything.<eos> For example, we had to read about Debbie's mother's recent blind date.<eos> Set up through a friend from church.<eos> After dinner, the guy stole her TiVo.<eos> Will she ever find love?<eos> Okay, great.<eos> So now you know where we are, and now you can go home.<eos> I want to go in.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'm black, so I love to yell things out in movies.<eos> I don't know why, though.<eos> Are we pinks or what?<eos> Parking is abundant.<eos> Marty.<eos> What are these?<eos> Eyeballs?<eos> We just met them in the parking lot.<eos> But I do know why the caged bird sings.<eos> No, I don't.
Every single one of 'em.<eos> They all think you're a dangerous lunatic, - and I agree with them.<eos> - Oh! Short-sighted fools.<eos> They're obviously not worthy of your leadership.<eos> You're better off without them.<eos> Well, I would disagree, since now you and I... have to make 200 gingerbread cookies by tomorrow morning by ourselves.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, I can't.<eos> I have a, um, a work thing which I have to att...<eos> - No, you don't.

The duty of our floor Monkarsh Lucas says.<eos> True<eos> Me again closes, Hush papi.<eos> You know how I like their stories more?<eos> Get off my balls.<eos> Why not sit in front?<eos> - Because you have to pay.<eos> Play "Zheng". That came last pays.<eos> Joe goes down by a car as an old man.<eos> Does the radio?
Why don't you come and talk to her with me?<eos> No, thanks. Not my job.<eos> Dr. Harris!<eos> I did see you, Dr. Harris.<eos> Or you imagined me.<eos> I have that effect on some people.<eos> Whether you remember it or not, I know I was outside of my body, and I know that you were there with me.<eos> You can believe that.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I do.
Look, relapse, it's just... it's... it's a normal part of recovery.<eos> (Huell) Sure is the fun part.<eos> We're gonna get you out of there.<eos> (blows air) Give me your earrings.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Your earrings.<eos> Uh, give 'em to me.<eos> You'll get 'em back.<eos> So listen, I mean, you and, uh... Trebek, you-you... you used to date?<eos> We did.
- Judge Reinhold. - Both:<eos> Oh.<eos> Freaky Friday.<eos> [Stilted] Oh, Troy, you are so thoughtful.<eos> I wish I had the capacity for sentimentality like you do.<eos> [Stilted] Me? I wish I was more like you.<eos> No emotional hang-ups, endless cool adventures.<eos> You have it so easy.<eos> No, you do, Troy.<eos> No, you do, Abed.
Both: I wish I had my own body back!<eos> [Babbling gibberish] Sorry, routine light switch check.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Oh, I've been meaning to see this.<eos> First, the easiest part, because it's the most obvious.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I proved today that I'm not ready for this.<eos> I wanted it to work.<eos> I did.
But we're very close.<eos> And my manager Glenn is gonna walk me down the aisle.<eos> Not your mother?<eos> Ah. She unfortunately can't make it, it being last minute and all.<eos> I'm sure those rehab facilities are quite strict with patients leaving.<eos> Was she excited when you told her?<eos> I haven't gotten the chance to tell her yet.<eos> Really?<eos> Don't you want her to meet the man that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with?<eos> Of course I do.
You gotta arrest me, it's the law.<eos> Looks like we got all the proof we need.<eos> You're never gonna prove we were in that bank.<eos> Yeah, you got nothing, man.<eos> You won't be able to prove a thing.<eos> You don't have a chance.<eos> Captain Renard, what can you tell us about the masked bank robbers?<eos> The arrests have been made, and the fugitives are being brought into the precinct now.<eos> We will have to wait for confirmation of identities.<eos> - Captain Renard, do you...
I mean, yeah, I may have - said something about if she...<eos> I was trying to scare her smart.<eos> And I would never go to the cops, you know that.<eos> It's Wendy you should be worrying about.<eos> - She's got Tara...<eos> - Don't change the goddamn subject.<eos> Mom, why do you always have to stir shit up with me and Tara?<eos> We got a situation out here, yo.<eos> - What happened?<eos> I didn't...
What for?<eos> Red is in no hurry. Bring 'em in.<eos> Oh.<eos> Look, Red,<eos> I'm all about fun, the girls know that.<eos> It's how things work in my unit.<eos> They also know that if want to survive in here, if they want to eat, sleep or... speak to their kids, they'll do what I say.<eos> You don't want to be the odd one out, do you?<eos> Eh?<eos> Do you, Red?
Hey, you bitch!<eos> Do you want Maccas or not?<eos> All right, just don't forget the nuggets!<eos> Doreen, what's going on?<eos> Sweetheart, what's happening?<eos> Mr. Jackson.<eos> He's going to take her away.<eos> I've got to find out who killed Mrs Jackson.<eos> He reckons you know something.<eos> Doreen, I don't.
I started thinking about that day.<eos> And then you fucking walk in!<eos> And you're not even him any more.<eos> You even took that away from me.<eos> Can we...?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> I er...<eos> You look... You look good.<eos> I didn't...
No new leads.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> None of the women are speaking.<eos> There's no standout suspects.<eos> Makes your life easier.<eos> Takes the heat off.<eos> Especially with today.<eos> Well, no.<eos> I want to know what happened to Meg.<eos> We all do.
You don't think I don't want some?<eos> I want to but I'm not going to.<eos> You'll be right.<eos> You'll be right.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> You will.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Every time I talk, I open my mouth, people laugh.<eos> No, they don't, Boomer. They do.
She loves that job.<eos> And I understand.<eos> But I'm sorry, there's going to be a new peer worker whether it's you or not.<eos> ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah...<eos> Hey!<eos> What did she want?<eos> Nothing, she just asked me about the home brewing stuff.<eos> Oh, shit, am I in trouble?<eos> I thought they found that.<eos> Yeah, they did.
- Yeah, no worries.<eos> Er, Fletch?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry about before.<eos> I think you might have misunderstood what I meant.<eos> I just meant that we should...<eos> You know, all hang out together at volleyball.<eos> I don't think I did misunderstand.<eos> Well, you did. Yeah.
YOUR unit?<eos> Not any more, Jacs.<eos> What's going on with this investigation?<eos> You worried what they'll discover?<eos> Find out for me.<eos> I don't see the point, Jacs.<eos> I'm only gonna tell you what we both already know.<eos> You had something to do with Debbie's death.<eos> I know who killed your wife.<eos> No, you don't.
I worry someone's going to drop the Petri dish with the embryos, and it's all a waste.<eos> I worry that I might kill someone.<eos> Probably my husband.<eos> I think IVF makes it a crime of passion.<eos> That's good.<eos> This is our second try.<eos> Our chances are halved, aren't they?<eos> Mm, statistics are tricky.<eos> You know best how you feel.<eos> But I don't.
I saw a Strider last night.<eos> Oh, I didn't think they were real, Lucy.<eos> It was looking in my window.<eos> I think you were dreaming, baby doll.<eos> Sorry about this, Steve.<eos> Lucy, stop scaring yourself.<eos> Come on, get your coat.<eos> We can't be late.<eos> Now, there's a picture.<eos> Don't.
We may not be blood brothers, but he doesn't hate me.<eos> Oh, he does now.<eos> Evidently, he found out about that thing from last May.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I was there when I told him.<eos> You have until 10:00 a.m.<eos> Then I'm calling Dallas.<eos> And Mark may not take your call, but he'll sure as hell take mine.<eos> How do I know you're not going to turn around and get him to pay more?<eos> You don't.
The real nightmare would be-- would be if you didn't want to be with me.<eos> Do you really mean that?<eos> I meant it the first time I ever saw you.<eos> Rachel, I know that I'm not who you want me to be, but--but you know what happened in that room.<eos> You know what we both felt.<eos> I--<eos> I don't want to lose that.<eos> I just keep wishing you never told me.<eos> But then it never would have happened.<eos> And it did.
You need to get rid of him as quartermaster.<eos> Miss Hessington, first of all, I want you to familiarize yourself with this man.<eos> U.S. attorney Richard Jensen.<eos> He's one of the best there is, and he's who we'll be going up against.<eos> Well, that's all well and good, Mr. Specter, but I have one question.<eos> Why should I hire you?<eos> Because you trust Edward Darby.<eos> I'm afraid that only gets you in the room.<eos> This civil servant seems to have a personal vendetta against me, and I don't even know why.<eos> Well, I do.
Your beloved associates are mine.<eos> You set me up.<eos> What better way to catch a rat than with quartermaster cheese?<eos> What are you gonna do, beg Darby to undo what you just begged him to do?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nigel, the associates are my life.<eos> So please don't do this.<eos> When I was at preparatory school, like you, I was bullied again and again.<eos> It was painful, but I always saw them coming.<eos> But with you, I didn't.
I never wrote a letter like that.<eos> I'm not recording you.<eos> I don't need to record you.<eos> This letter was printed from your hard drive, which has your computer's digital signature.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanna know, if you had the chance, would you have traded that car to get your parents back together?<eos> [Scoffs]<eos> That's a stupid goddamn question, and you know it.<eos> I never had that chance, so what does it matter?<eos> Because I do.
So, you heard that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you understand?<eos> No, not really, but I know you have to do what you believe is right.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> I know.<eos> Kiss Alexis for me, and...<eos> Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> You got to believe that.<eos> I do.
Have a good day, Tom.<eos> You, too.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Anne Glass.<eos> Second time she's called.<eos> Did she say what it was about?<eos> Yeah, she said it was personal.<eos> I assumed you knew her.<eos> I don't.
God! Ah!<eos> Morning.<eos> Oh. You all right in there?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I was just...<eos> I'm about to take a shower.<eos> Oh, want some company?<eos> Um, yeah, of course I do.
And she and her adoptive mom, Mary, also had a falling out.<eos> Twice the mommies, twice the baggage.<eos> You must confront the source of your estrangement.<eos> No. I can't.<eos> I won't!<eos> - Your anger is hurting you.<eos> - She hurt me...!<eos> You have to go home, Bo.<eos> You must forgive.<eos> Like hell I do.
that's why I'm here, to talk about your options.<eos> Go on.<eos> I know you don't have all the answers you're looking for right now.<eos> But if you don't follow the path of destiny that shapes the future as I know it, the world won't end up as it did in my time.<eos> Is that necessarily a bad thing?<eos> I wanna go home.<eos> I wanna get back to my family and the only way I'm gonna be able to do that is if things stay on track.<eos> Kiera... when you tried to stop that bombing, did you know that you were possibly throwing away a chance of getting home?<eos> - I didn't have a choice!<eos> - Yes, you did.
You're connected to these terrorists.<eos> Maybe just in the way that a good agent becomes close to whoever he or she is tracking.<eos> But, until you get truthful with me, we're gonna be spending a lot of time together.<eos> Our first date.<eos> It's not starting well.<eos> Well, next time I'll bring flowers.<eos> Come on.<eos> Beth!<eos> Beth, you brought your husband.<eos> Yes I did!
In that way, madness lies.<eos> All you have to do is open your heart.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - I know it hurts.<eos> It will destroy me.<eos> - Because?<eos> - Because I left him.<eos> I didn't even say goodbye.<eos> You know how kids are, they...<eos> No, you don't.
Go!<eos> One, two, three...<eos> carry the eight... no, no...<eos> April, June and November.<eos> 31 zero...<eos> Dates...<eos> Hey.<eos> So, this guy's asking for Kiera, and they were gonna send him away but I thought maybe you'd want to talk to him.<eos> You should straighten that, you know.<eos> Yeah, yeah I do, thanks, Betty.
And look, that day, in that building, five top executives from big pharmaceutical companies were meeting.<eos> Executives who were in competition with each other, all five of the companies have denied that the meeting even took place until life insurance policies on the dead executives were paid out.<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> So what, they were colluding?<eos> Suppressing cures to some medicine.<eos> This... is just the tip of the ice berg.<eos> Kagame, he told me that the truth would reveal itself.<eos> And you revealed it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> He did.
Yes, she did.<eos> We all did.<eos> You should watch it.<eos> Wait. Isn't--isn't that where-- That is where we shelved the Norge Porthole.<eos> This is bad.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Secret Service?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Do you remember a group called The Last People On Earth?<eos> You damn right I do.
Uh, if you're looking for Steve or Myka, they're cleaning up in aisle-- aisle--<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> I know you did.<eos> That's it.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's it.<eos> As a Warehouse consultant, can you state, that under no duress, you accept and understand your responsibilities?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> And--and I do.
We had a deal.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> Believe it or not, I'm doing you a favor.<eos> By preventing my vengeance?<eos> Ask yourself how I'm doing that.<eos> By using your dark magic.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Magic is here, and that makes matters a bit more complicated.<eos> If you go off half-cocked after an empowered Rumplestiltskin, do you know what'll happen?<eos> So you do.
You are in a better place.<eos> Wait!<eos> No, please, don't!<eos> Wait!<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> As your patient, The Dark One must've told you all manner of secrets.<eos> Where is his dagger?<eos> I don't know anything about a dagger.<eos> No, you don't.
Now what makes you think you're any different?<eos> Tell me something, darling.<eos> Why would you want to fight for a man like that?<eos> Because I still see good in him.<eos> Because I believe he's changed.<eos> Because his heart is true.<eos> And yours?<eos> Yours is rotten.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> How the hell did you...
Kill me!<eos> He has to show you how powerful he is.<eos> No.<eos> Rumple, this...<eos> this is what he wants... to destroy every bit of good in you.<eos> Rip my heart out.<eos> Kill me like you did Milah, and then I'll finally be reunited with her.<eos> He has to die, Belle.<eos> No!<eos> No, he doesn't!
Yeah, um, what exactly are trimmers?<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, get Remo to explain it to you.<eos> He's made the run about 20 times.<eos> It was Gil.<eos> He wants us to go down to Fortuna and pick up the trimmers.<eos> What exactly are trimmers?<eos> Really?<eos> You don't know what a trimmer is?<eos> Why don't you explain it to me?<eos> [Sighs] How about I don't?
How long? Less than 30.<eos> (White Vincent) Apologies.<eos> I'm a few minutes late.<eos> I have the first three clocks.<eos> Tell her it's just a matter of time till she has the object she seeks.<eos> Excuse me. Are you reading "Disinfo"? Yeah.<eos> The... there's this part right here that he mysteriously erased before he left. There's theories that before he died, Einstein discovered something, an equation that would create a new form of power, but he thought that the people weren't ready for it.<eos> So he erased it so no one would know what it was. (Vibrating)<eos> Hey, Hank.<eos> Did you... did you...
You gotta get me outta here.<eos> The cops are gonna ask questions.<eos> Well, there's only one land mass Where they could've hid the cross On a bearing of north 5 degrees from that location.<eos> Do you remember i told you about the man That kills me in my dreams, That i can't see his face?<eos> It seems to have come to me.<eos> Well, most scientific research Says dreams are just mental garbage Working its way out of the system.<eos> Or perhaps it's the past telling you That there's a debt that needs repaying.<eos> You know the man?<eos> I do.<eos> I did.
Come here. Come here.<eos> Hi. Mm.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Okay.<eos> This plant And this plant are exactly the same.<eos> They can replicate on their own.<eos> Vegetative propagation.<eos> It is as old as time...<eos> But it still amazes me.<eos> As you do me.
I'll bring some men.<eos> Actually, I think it's time I got my hands dirty, too.<eos> hello?<eos> rachel. It's hank's father.<eos> Oh. Hi, mr. Galliston.<eos> I need to speak to hank.<eos> He's not answering his cell.<eos> Do you know where I can find him?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I don't.
I experienced the same sense of betrayal when I found out the real deal about high fructose corn syrup.<eos> I mean, sugar is sugar.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Javier!<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> If you think it's chocolate cake, then yes.<eos> Otherwise, no.<eos> I specifically asked for no chocolate cake.<eos> Marty hated chocolate cake.<eos> He did?
Don't wanna know.<eos> The least we can do is take this nasty bullet out.<eos> I'll scrub in.<eos> You're a doctor?<eos> No, but I've been pre-med for 20 years.<eos> I love college.<eos> I'll prep the patient.<eos> Do we have time for a makeover?<eos> It's a horizontal laceration, Kasey.<eos> Of course we do!
Brace yourselves.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.<eos> - I'll give you your money back!<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> Body of Proof 3x09<eos> - Disappearing Act Original air date April 16, 2013<eos> Please don't.
Hey, you hear that?<eos> What?<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - Underneath the highway noise was a clicking sound.<eos> - I'll give you your money back!<eos> - A highway traffic counter?<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> No, the interval's too regular, right?<eos> It sounds like there's a bell in the background, too, real faint.<eos> Please don't.
Tell him I have another assignment for him.<eos> I don't understand how he gets so close to take these pictures.<eos> We all have our specialty.<eos> You have your knife.<eos> The Watchman has his eye.<eos> I find the cracks on the surface.<eos> Anything yet?<eos> She should have responded by now.<eos> What if she knows?<eos> She doesn't.
Granger's about to interrogate Inman.<eos> Go through the camera footage.<eos> Let us know what you find.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right?<eos> Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Exactly what it looks like.<eos> You actually think that I had something to do with Parish getting killed?<eos> No, I don't.
No, that was very dramatic, Mr. Beale.<eos> It's just that... we make a good team.<eos> We make an awesome team.<eos> But I don't know, what if I do?<eos> Do what?<eos> Leave Ops some day.<eos> It's not happening any time soon.<eos> I have a long way to go before I can keep up with guys like Callen and Sam, but it's...<eos> You're gonna get your chance.<eos> And when you do,
Look.<eos> Look.<eos> Governor Reston...<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Tell me when it's over.<eos> You need 270 electoral college votes to win, right?<eos> And you've got 188 locked up from the deep red states.<eos> So you need a pickup of 82 votes, most likely from a combination of Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina.<eos> So, basically, you can't afford to lose more than one of them.<eos> - And if I do?
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Mellie...<eos> I wanted to apologize for Fitz.<eos> That's not like him, but he has had too much to drink.<eos> And he has always had problems with his father, and I just...<eos> He respects you.<eos> He needs you.<eos> We both do, and...
Sugar Ray Leonard put Roberto Durán down with a bolo punch when I was a kid.<eos> That was something.<eos> But I hear Randall wants to get into fighter management.<eos> You got any kind of line on what that looks like?<eos> So, saying these fighters Randall's looking to manage are what... chickens?<eos> Gamecocks.<eos> Gamecocks.<eos> Said he wanted to manage fighters.<eos> - I figured he meant, you know... - How much money did you say it was, again?<eos> I didn't.
Ellen May, you don't want to be here.<eos> You've been looking for a way out as long as I've known you.<eos> I'm saying, darlin', this is your way out.<eos> Ava... this is my home.<eos> I grew up here.<eos> I always thought that maybe...<eos> Maybe I'd meet the right boy, get a little house.<eos> I ain't much for babies, but Honey.<eos> You're getting the chance I never got... you get to start over.<eos> But I don't...
He knew what he was doing because you can see him actually in the film.<eos> It's-- the def is so good, you can see him ventilating.<eos> You can see him ventilating really hard.<eos> So he knows about swimming and diving and being underwater.<eos> He may have been assuming he was going under again.<eos> I did not walk away unimpressed by his calm demeanor during that whole affair.<eos> I would be scared shitless.<eos> He was near to the end.<eos> Presumably, Ken Peters had a relationship with this whale.<eos> Maybe he did.
Oh, crap.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm jumpy, too.<eos> How's your head?<eos> Probably about the same as yours.<eos> It's a good day to be alive, Beth.<eos> My kids thank you.<eos> Hell, even my ex thanks you.<eos> Yeah, don't mention it.<eos> I didn't. They did it.
Not open to discussion.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, Wade, I can't.<eos> I can feed you intravenously if I have to.<eos> I watched a YouTube video.<eos> I can get it done.<eos> Fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you have crackers?<eos> Of course I do.
Did you know that he was engaged?<eos> You know, I heard it from Rick, in QD, who heard it from Arlene in Reception.<eos> Word travels fast around here.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Ever since Hodges accused me of trying to steal Wendy...<eos> Wait, who's Wendy?<eos> Our old DNA analyst.<eos> Sorry. Uh, anyway, since then, he doesn't really confide in me anymore.<eos> Okay, you have some results for me.<eos> I do.
Okay, Gibbs, you know what?<eos> I'm...<eos> I will be okay, I promise.<eos> I need you to bring your A game.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Who's in charge here?<eos> Mr. Dunn, I just need you to follow me to the conference room.<eos> No, no, no. I'm done with the shuffling.<eos> Look, I understand, but...<eos> No, you don't.
And this is our killer.<eos> He strikes and kills Lyla Cutwright, and then, he moves to the other side as Dunn exits.<eos> With his hand, the killer bashes Dunn's head up against the car.<eos> I found blood and hair transfer from Dunn here.<eos> The hit rendered him unconscious.<eos> The killer then moves Dunn into the car, and drives it off the ridge while he's running alongside.<eos> Well, how does he push down on the gas?<eos> Reenter the weapon used to kill Cutwright.<eos> I found the same aluminum fragments on the gas pedal as I did in her head wound. I thought you said the weapon was made out of chestnut?<eos> I did.
- Good, that means you're free.<eos> I accidentally ran into Lana again.<eos> And judging by your looks, I'm just gonna get right to it.<eos> She's coming to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> Well, thanks for letting me know so I have time to make other plans.<eos> And I will be using an excuse to be named later.<eos> Oh, come on, she really wants to meet her baby's big sister.<eos> Lana wants to meet me?<eos> - Bay wants to meet me?<eos> - Of course she does.
Ever.<eos> - We should finalize it.<eos> - What?<eos> I think we should finalize it.<eos> You know, just talk to the lawyers, file the paperwork, dot the "I"s, cross the "t"s.<eos> You know, if there's anything that's gonna tell our boy that he's a part of this family, that's it.<eos> I just think we need to, you know, just take the leap.<eos> You do, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.
And then, out of nowhere, it just, like-- it came back, - and it's in her lungs. - I know that.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's everywhere, and she's scared.<eos> I feel terrible, and I'm sorry that she's scared, but that's not you.<eos> - That's not you.<eos> - How do we know that?<eos> - We don't know that, Adam.<eos> - Yes, we do, honey.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> We don't, okay?
Hey, Dr. breeland, did you get those leeches yet? Oh, uh, yeah.<eos> They're wriggling around my office.<eos> George!<eos> George, there you...<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> Didn't you get my messages?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did, and I will... I will call you back, but I got a client, and I got a...<eos> Son, I'm sure you were startled by what you saw on Christmas Eve.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you...
Okay, go!<eos> We need to make something exciting, because-- [Laughing]<eos> It's the highest card wins. [Grunts]<eos> There's no strategy to this game.<eos> Whoever invented this game- what do you mean there's no strategy?<eos> It's--you- the person who invented the game, he had a short day that day.<eos> [Laughing] He just came in and said,<eos> "all right, we need another game."<eos> - Seven beats six!<eos> - I don't even...
He was supposed to meet me.<eos> He didn't... he didn't text me or anything.<eos> What an ass.<eos> I know.<eos> He does a lot of squats.<eos> But it's still rude for him to blow you off like this.<eos> Do you think he's coming back?<eos> I wouldn't count on it.<eos> He said, "Greg Archer's gotta go renew his library card, know what I mean?"<eos> I didn't, but...
Now, why would you want to play for the other team?<eos> It's not a game.<eos> You don't get another chance at what you have.<eos> I have it all.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The one with the fur.<eos> You know, I might just take you up on those theater tickets.<eos> - You must see "Hair."<eos> - Oh, you like that?<eos> - Who doesn't?
Okay, Tuesday morning is perfect.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yep.<eos> We'll have your wig ready then, ma'am.<eos> You're allowed to make personal calls after 5:00, especially if they make you laugh.<eos> My friend Stan was telling me a funny story<eos> - about one of our old clients.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Oh, it's complicated, but basically the guy from Heinz Baked Beans hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.<eos> Of course he does.
I will have VIVAC intelligence sent to you, Gibbs. Assassins, weapons experts, any relevant suspects.<eos> Eli had too many enemies.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And they brought us together.<eos> In which case it is possible that I could be next.<eos> Well, maybe I should let you walk.<eos> Do the whole world a favor.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> The hell I do.
Not yet.<eos> You know, this whole ordeal has made me realize something that I didn't expect.<eos> It's helped me better understand your choices.<eos> Always thought I had a sense of how you felt at the time, Gibbs.<eos> Now I realize I wasn't close.<eos> I've never wanted that kind of justice before.<eos> But since the other night, hell, that's all I think about.<eos> Was it worth it, Gibbs?<eos> It had to be some relief.<eos> Do me a favor, Gibbs.
I won't do that when we hang out.<eos> Ow.<eos> Hey, thanks for plus-onening me to this elbow rub.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> You know, I think you really have something with Rail Mail.<eos> Oh, it's Rail Mall, actually, but thank you.<eos> That means a ton coming from you.<eos> I have read a lot about you in different business journals.<eos> You know the secret to a successful negotiation?<eos> Yes, I do.

I am really, really sorry.<eos> That's the last call of the night, I promise.<eos> But the good news is...<eos> I just closed a really big deal.<eos> That's great!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You want to come back to my place and celebrate?<eos> Uh, no, I...<eos> I, ah...<eos> But I just don't.
Get away from me.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Oh, watch out, I know karate, man...<eos> I know karate!<eos> Do you want to die twice, motherfucker?<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Here's the one thing that that doesn't consider, is that it is illegal for money to exchange hands in cyberspace.<eos> Uh, it is, for now, but I expect that to change.<eos> Well, what if it doesn't?

We judge.<eos> We say, "Well, she can't be a good masseuse because she works off the Strip."<eos> "She doesn't use scented candles."<eos> "She doesn't sanitize the table."<eos> Prostate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, it's effective apartheid, if I'm being honest.<eos> Yeah, homey don't play that.<eos> Uh-uh. No, ma'am.<eos> Homey do not.
I think he might have info on a fugitive.<eos> Which fugitive?<eos> Jimmy Hoffa.<eos> Is there any particular reason you're treating us like a couple of bleached assholes?<eos> Not in particular, no.<eos> Oh.<eos> What's up, Bart?<eos> Well, I hear you're having an interesting morning.<eos> Tim tell you I wasn't coming in?<eos> Yes, he did.
She cooked the whole thing.<eos> There we go.<eos> I hope they're good.<eos> ♪<eos> This is the saddest part.<eos> ♪<eos> We're gonna miss you, sweetie.<eos> We had a great time with you. We had a fantastic time.<eos> It's been the best sailing I've ever done.<eos> Don't do anything reckless.
Teddy, how am I supposed to have a personal relationship with someone who doesn't even live out here?<eos> She loves L.A., and she comes and visits all the time.<eos> You could visit D.C.<eos> I mean, she's everything you want.<eos> What I want is someone who is neutral.<eos> Not someone who's on your team.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Silver, we're on the same team.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> Sure we do.
Like Amanda says, writing about sex is easy.<eos> It's the pathos that we're drawn to.<eos> Well, my pathos is personal, so if you'll excuse me...<eos> You should give it some thought.<eos> At least meet with Amanda?<eos> She says your blog could be the next Fifty Shades of Grey.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I get it, Dixon; you're a startup operation, you got one artist.<eos> And I need a break. See the videos I sent you of Adrianna?<eos> I did.
Well, thanks for letting me tag along.<eos> I needed to get out of the house, and... maybe hearing about other people's stories will help me get over my writer's block.<eos> Why don't you just write about your steamy lust for Liam?<eos> Hello.<eos> - Wait, who told you about that?<eos> - Naomi said you stole Mark and used him as a sex buffer.<eos> Half brother as a chaperone.<eos> - That's a desperate move.<eos> - You must want Liam real bad.<eos> No, I don't.
We are indeed!<eos> Sorry, I thought I had something.<eos> You tell him... dad.<eos> That was then, and this is now.<eos> He's right, old man.<eos> My whole life has been a lie.<eos> Pay no attention to the man...<eos> I am Pat Childs, CEO of Child's Corp, inventor of the O-mobile!<eos> It doesn't even exist.<eos> It never did.
That's why you took his work to your friend.<eos> Caleb approached me a few months ago about this project he was working on.<eos> I was skeptical, but when I saw his code, I couldn't believe my eyes.<eos> - So I decided to help him.<eos> - By cutting him out.<eos> No.<eos> All he wanted was some money up front for this trip.<eos> - He said he didn't even want credit.<eos> - Why would you agree to that?<eos> I didn't.
I can hardly blame you for that.<eos> But I forgive you.<eos> Garson:<eos> The prosecution calls Harris Ryland to the stand.<eos> [ Wheels squeaking ]<eos> [ Grunts ]<eos> [ Grunts ]<eos> Thank you.<eos> Judge Tate: Mr. Ryland, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
He's really gonna go to bat for you today at the sentencing.<eos> And we're all preparing something.<eos> It's the same jury, Sue Ellen.<eos> They heard me say I was on drugs, that I walked away from my baby.<eos> I saw their faces.<eos> The look of hate on their faces when they convicted me.<eos> They also saw the pain that Ryland and his mother put you through.<eos> There's no way they're gonna send you to 20 years.<eos> Do you think Emma will ever forgive me?<eos> I do.
I'm not saying he's perfect but pretty damn close, and the mere suggestion that he could be possibly involved in something like this is incredibly insulting to him, to his family, and to his legacy.<eos> Okay, that is a, a beautiful speech.<eos> Okay, where is he?<eos> Mr. Lowry, if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say, then you understand, we have to do our job.<eos> Now, where is he?<eos> We're not going to ask you again.<eos> Geez. Ah, boy.<eos> We've been spinning all morning to cover for him.<eos> Oh, you don't even know where he is?<eos> No, we don't.
Josh, where's Amy Davidson?<eos> She's inside with Powers.<eos> Brad Powers.<eos> That's, uh, Freed's opponent.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Well, he came by to discuss the ground rules of the debate with the congressman, I was handling the situation.<eos> Then all of a sudden, Amy shows up.<eos> Picks up right where she left off, like nothing even happened.<eos> Did she say where she was?<eos> No, she didn't.
He saved my life.<eos> And that's all he wants for you, too.<eos> What are you doing? Geez.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to scare you.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> A shot of adrenaline is exactly what I needed to wake up.<eos> Well, you want to switch to a sugar high?<eos> Pass, but very subtle letting me know that you have a valentine.<eos> Well, actually I don't... yet.
What do you have up your sleeve?<eos> Why is it so important I stick around this morning?<eos> Soon all will be revealed.<eos> Gavin, you know I hate surprises.<eos> You hate when people are late.<eos> You hate traffic.<eos> You hate when I put the empty milk container back in the fridge.<eos> But you most certainly do not hate surprises.<eos> You know I love you, I would do anything for you?<eos> Of course I do.
And I won't let anything come between us,<eos> Ever.<eos> You ready?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Does she know I'm coming?<eos> Your mother's emotions on this will be complex.<eos> I'm not sure even she knows what to expect.<eos> And my first priority is protecting her.<eos> I thought you said that she wanted to see me.<eos> Well, she does.
But I think I know who did.<eos> Gavin doran.<eos> You think he'd do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just have this feeling, uh...<eos> And I do not want to be tied to this scandal For the rest of my career.<eos> Well, Henry, you need a thick skin.<eos> Politics is a dirty business.<eos> If you're gonna get involved, you better have a good reason.<eos> Do you?
I don't know. I think I have a good feeling about this.<eos> That's great news.<eos> It's only sparkling cider.<eos> We have to celebrate.<eos> You are so good to me.<eos> To Brian.<eos> To Brian.<eos> Baby, I'm not sure I can do this.<eos> Well, this guy Sullivan sounds like a total lunatic.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Also, Gibbs, um, she had fallen behind on her mortgage.<eos> He was sending her cash.<eos> A few thousand every time to help cover costs.<eos> No sign of an outside job.<eos> Well, he had to be getting the cash from somewhere.<eos> Find out where.<eos> Private Holland.<eos> Your C.O. know you're here?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No one does.
He said that he wasn't used to having people return vehicles cleaner than when they drove them off the lot.<eos> Silvana...<eos> I know you did it.<eos> I know you killed your sister.<eos> I loved my sister.<eos> I don't doubt that.<eos> Because, in my experience, a brutal murder like Marta's can only come from deep emotions.<eos> Love turned to hate through betrayal.<eos> You don't even know what you're talking about.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Just text me.<eos> Bye.<eos> Daddy, I can't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Izzy.<eos> Come on. Jump to daddy.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's fun.<eos> Just do a Superman right into my arms.
Oh.<eos> You're not named.<eos> Not named as...<eos> As the father?<eos> No, no, not named on the consent form.<eos> As someone who can be told any diagnostic information.<eos> Right.<eos> But you, um...<eos> You have the diagnostic information right there in front of you, don't you?<eos> Well, yeah, I do.
What do you want?<eos> I don't want anything.<eos> Really, I'm only here to actually let you know that I know about you and Elijah.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - I told her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My dear roommate and very serious ex-boyfriend told me he had sex with my best friend.<eos> Hannah, I'm very sorry.<eos> I really didn't want you to hear about it like this.<eos> I really, really didn't.
You could get your dick up for a watermelon.<eos> Do not act like this is normal.<eos> I thought this whole age thing was not going to be a problem, but...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You're not breaking up with me, are you?<eos> - I'm afraid I am.<eos> - Because I fucked Marnie?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> - You don't wanna give this one more try?<eos> - I do not, no.
- You don't wanna give this one more try?<eos> - I do not, no.<eos> - Okay, look, I made a mistake.<eos> - I know.<eos> Listen.<eos> It just says so much about who you are right now.<eos> I've spent so much time confused and I'm not anymore, so I don't want to be with someone who's confused or-- or bi.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I thought you knew what you wanted.<eos> I did.
I've been with her the whole time.<eos> Hannah, did you call 911?<eos> I didn't even let it ring.<eos> I honestly-- I pressed 911, I hung up.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> - You called the po-po?<eos> - Well, you were stalking me.<eos> We're gonna have to take you both down so you can fill out a report.<eos> Honestly, no.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't even let it ring.<eos> I honestly-- I pressed 911, I hung up.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> - You called the po-po?<eos> - Well, you were stalking me.<eos> We're gonna have to take you both down so you can fill out a report.<eos> Honestly, no.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I was just asking about restraining orders.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
Come on.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I got the blanket.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Uh...<eos> I gotta go to the hospital.<eos> I didn't think you had to go in today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
No, because I, unlike you, Jordan, like to fill my patients with hope rather than devastating them five minutes after we've met.<eos> You're not filling 'em with hope.<eos> You're just delaying the inevitable.<eos> Hey, Blanca, I need you to take my name off the board.<eos> Right now. Immediately.<eos> Uh, who's gonna be taking your call instead?<eos> Uh, Jordan. See if he'll cover for me, okay?<eos> Lena.<eos> I want to talk to you about this morning.<eos> - I don't.
I've been trying to manage this thing for a very long time, and I don't think I can anymore.<eos> So I'm gonna leave IMH.<eos> You know why I put up with your nonsense?<eos> No.<eos> Honestly, I don't.<eos> Because when I weigh the good against the bad, the scale always tips towards the good.<eos> You save people that have no hope of being saved, and not everyone in this world can say that, but you can.<eos> Do you really want to give that up?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I just...<eos> Lena, please.<eos> - Just wait.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> You have made a complete fool out of me.<eos> You have humiliated me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like?<eos> To have those things done to you?<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> - You do?
Well, look, you did all the hard work.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> That was different.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> What the hell did you get me into?<eos> Oh, Oz had a little falling out with his last chemist and asked if I knew anyone.<eos> And you thought of me?<eos> Of course I did.
Yeah.<eos> You know Jackson told me he thinks James may not even need another major surgery?<eos> Really?<eos> Jackson told you that?<eos> Did Jackson have his hands on your boobs when he said it?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You made fun of me for sleeping with Karev.<eos> Called me a skank, made this "I don't wanna be like Leah" thing, and now you're sleeping with the boss.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Oh, well, I didn't.
You know Jackson told me he thinks James may not even need another major surgery?<eos> Really?<eos> Jackson told you that?<eos> Did Jackson have his hands on your boobs when he said it?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You made fun of me for sleeping with Karev.<eos> Called me a skank, made this "I don't wanna be like Leah" thing, and now you're sleeping with the boss.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Oh, well, I didn't.<eos> Now I do.
Delano... murdered my wife.<eos> He would've killed my cousin and me, too, if he had the chance.<eos> His brother...<eos> don't see it that way.<eos> He put me in here.<eos> And now you die.<eos> Kaleo!<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Why do you care what happens to him?<eos> I don't.
I couldn't sit up; I thought I was drowning...<eos> The Drake killed your mother and now wants to kill you?<eos> I don't think so because, when I was under water, I saw someone watching me.<eos> A man.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know, when I got up he was no longer there.<eos> The Drake pulls you up here from 1000 miles away... and the ghost of your grandmother shows you fragments of your family's past.<eos> I can't help but think that your mother is trying to tell you something.<eos> That my father killed her?<eos> Or who did.
I know.<eos> I'm just being a friend.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's all we have?<eos> The ice bullet and the metal fragment-- yeah, for now.<eos> 27 people working on this and we have nothing, Sweets.<eos> Look, I know how frustrating this must be.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you?<eos> 'Cause you don't.
- Nah, mate.<eos> - Take it easy, yeah?<eos> - Cool.<eos> Don't fucking touch me.<eos> Look, I told you, you get the rest when you do him.<eos> - He's gone and done you.<eos> - Yeah, I fucking did what you told me.<eos> - This guy's crazy.<eos> - Just give it to me.<eos> - When you do him. - All right.
I get it.<eos> You still have to do what I say.<eos> I am your boss and I am trying to save this patient's life.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> You're off my service.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you gonna do, get her fired?<eos> She didn't do anything.
Someone of your height and weight has been lying there for long periods.<eos> I have insomnia.<eos> I can watch TV out here without keeping Teri up.<eos> That's very considerate of you.<eos> And... untrue.<eos> The damp towels and the presence of your toiletries in the guest bathroom-- they suggest that your wife has banished you completely from the master bedroom.<eos> No.<eos> Stress in the marriage is to be expected, given your current unemployment.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> H-How did you...
I know your clothes-- they say sophisticated businesswoman, but the faint line across your thighs says garter belt with stockings.<eos> And you've made meaningful eye contact with almost every unattached man in here, even the paunchy ones.<eos> Now, should I alert security to your presence, or would you mind just-just answering just a couple of questions, hmm?<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> As I said, the manager of the hotel was killed last night.<eos> We're investigating the possibility that one of your managers may have had something to do with it.<eos> Why would any of those guys want to kill Teri?<eos> So, you knew her?<eos> Of course.<eos> We all did.
That was two operatives obeying orders.<eos> We started having sex when we were urged to conceive.<eos> Stopped when Teri got pregnant.<eos> Once we had Carly, we... looked more like a real American family.<eos> But... you can't raise a spy.<eos> Teri and I found ourselves with a daughter.<eos> I may not have loved Teri, but we both loved Carly.<eos> When did you initiate her into the family business?<eos> Come on, Mr. Purcell, the Russians invested a great deal of time and money into your family-- they must have had a plan for Carly.<eos> They did.
Yes.<eos> We're working on that.<eos> So...<eos> Those were your fingerprints in the house.<eos> Well, I've spent a lot of time in her house.<eos> But your fingerprints were everywhere.<eos> Under the bed, inside the bathroom cabinets, all over the closet shelves.<eos> You were looking for something.<eos> And I know you didn't find it...<eos> Because we did.
Got around the block and I... felt this... burning feeling in my shoulder.<eos> That's all I saw. That "dude" was an off-duty police officer, moonlighting at the check cashing store.<eos> Did it occur to you- - Did it cross your mind for 1 second to go back and help him? !<eos> I mean, se- - I was shot, too.<eos> And you knew you had an active bench warrant on a drug case, so you didn't want to stick around.<eos> You'd rather leave a man die in the street than go to court.<eos> Hey, please... I can't go back inside on that warrant.<eos> I got a kid.<eos> I wanted to call.<eos> Okay? I really did.
Let me see that.<eos> That would be unprofessional.<eos> That ain't real, man.<eos> What, you think I'm stupid?<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Yeah, you're tryin' to fool me. You give me too much credit, Anthony.<eos> You said you're gonna take me to court.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Do you really think that I'm playing some kind of trick on you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You'll have a chance to tell your story.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey. I am not going down for this, man!<eos> I didn't do this!<eos> He's lying to you!<eos> I didn't do this!<eos> Nice job everybody.<eos> We got 'im. Now we need to find the third guy and determine who actually pulled the trigger.<eos> Looks like I missed all the fun.<eos> You did.
I kinda got a date.<eos> Hey, hey, it's important.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> If something should happen to both me and the Captain,<eos> I need to make sure the people on this list don't take control of the Colorado.<eos> Make sure how?<eos> Your COB's the first name on here, Sam.<eos> If this goes the way I want it to, you can tear that up.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Focus on the ones in Jersey first.<eos> 24 hours before Bracken speaks--<eos> Maybe Beckett will have better luck with those threat letters.<eos> Man, these people need to get a life.<eos> Most of these guys, it seems their only companionship is the space alien that talks to them through their microwave.<eos> Yeah, well, there's a lot of lonely and confused people out there.<eos> But so far, none of the letters match the handwriting in our suspect's notebook.<eos> Considering what he's capable of, you would think Bracken would have more formidable enemies.<eos> Oh, obviously, you never saw the letter that I sent him.<eos> No, I did, actually.
- The wind kicked up and we held the ribbons and we rode on them?<eos> - No balloons?<eos> - She gaslighted us, dude.<eos> That was my second favorite childhood memory.<eos> Don Mclean didn't play your fifth birthday party.<eos> I'll give you some space.<eos> I just moved in so I need to get the power turned on.<eos> By tomorrow would be great actually.<eos> A credit card?<eos> Well, I do.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't sound like a bad thing, but I wouldn't have just assumed that this is one of them.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - What?<eos> So what?<eos> This isn't gonna happen?<eos> Oh my God, you're nuts.<eos> You're seriously certifiable.<eos> I have been calling and texting and throwing my self-respect out the window and basically stalking you, and you just told me I was outranked by lettuce.<eos> So yeah, it doesn't really seem like you want this to happen.<eos> - Well, I do.
Ben Dalton does this on the weekends.<eos> He's the one who told me that it might be a quick way to make some money.<eos> You know, I don't get it, Evan.<eos> One minute, you're a construction worker.<eos> The next minute you're a cowboy.<eos> Then you want to be a cop.<eos> What are you, the Village People?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Don't you see why I'm upset?<eos> 'Cause I don't --
It was stress.<eos> And I haven't been sleeping that well.<eos> No, it was more than that.<eos> You were out of control, and you know it.<eos> I just...<eos> [ Scoffs ]<eos> I thought getting shot was gonna be the worst thing that could happen.<eos> Six weeks from shipping out, and my unit gets ambushed.<eos> I should have died.<eos> A lot of good men did.
Whoa! [ Laughs ]<eos> Where'd you learn how to kick like that?<eos> My Uncle taught me.<eos> We used to go one-on-one all the time back home in Louisiana when I was a kid.<eos> You guys still close?<eos> He died when I was 16.<eos> Great guy.<eos> Even better left winger.<eos> Mind if I ask how he passed?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Dr. Wilson.<eos> Dr. Park will perform the procedure.<eos> What am I missing here?<eos> She's a registered organ donor.<eos> Yes, your honor, which would suggest that she agreed to have her organs harvested.<eos> But in ascertaining the validity and therefore enforceability of any such agreement, we look to see if there was an actual meeting of the minds.<eos> Here, I submit there was none.<eos> Because?<eos> Well, there's no indication that she truly knew what organ donation even entails.<eos> In fact, most people do not.
He said it was a one-time weakness.<eos> And once he confessed, you were bound by the vow of the confessional.<eos> See, that's still not good enough, father.<eos> You put other girls in jeopardy.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He swore to me that it wouldn't happen again.<eos> And you believed him?<eos> Pedophiles are gifted liars.<eos> Yes, I did.
I never said who it was.<eos> I was afraid you'd go after him, get in trouble.<eos> I beat him up.<eos> I'm in jail.<eos> He got the wrong priest.<eos> You should let him go.<eos> That's not the way it works.<eos> I'm sorry, Enrique.<eos> [Crying] I'm so sorry.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
A gift.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> There, there!<eos> You must be hungry.<eos> What? !<eos> She's drinking it right down.<eos> I've got milk!<eos> She laughed!<eos> She did!
Not at all.<eos> She's an adorable little princess.<eos> She has yet to be made up.<eos> I am truly ashamed.<eos> Don't give it a second thought.<eos> To observe her as she really is will help me think of an appropriate name.<eos> I am glad to hear that.<eos> Please bestow a fine name on our princess.<eos> Your Highness, come and greet Lord Akita.<eos> How do you do, sir.
Oh, come on.<eos> Joey, the chance that someone might find out our little secret...<eos> Yeah, I know, babe, it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Makes it even more fun.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Look, if you come to my place tomorrow morning, we can finish where we left off, right?<eos> I can't, I have to be at Dexter's by 7:00.<eos> What?<eos> - Fuck. - Mm.<eos> Do me a favor.
The fuck?<eos> Hey. You brought the kid.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You didn't answer your phone.<eos> Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> Well, I need to get ahold of Deb.<eos> And you need me for that why?<eos> I don't know where she is.<eos> What do you mean you don't know where she is?<eos> I just don't.
- Is it?<eos> Would have to run tests, functional mri.<eos> Okay. Okay. Um...<eos> - Looking for...<eos> - Lesion, tumor, brain cancer.<eos> Don't think have...<eos> would show other symptoms.<eos> How soon can we do the tests?<eos> What caused the sister's kidney failure... do we know?<eos> Yes, we do. Amphotericin "b."
What if we finally got one?<eos> You gonna take off the dead guy robe?<eos> Well, well.<eos> It's so late.<eos> I didn't expect you in at all.<eos> Three times I had to transfer the bus lines to lose him today.<eos> Right.<eos> Your sinister friend.<eos> You don't believe me I'm being followed, heh, heh.<eos> Nobody ever does.
Why not her brother?<eos> I don't think they're getting along, you know, and she's a friend.<eos> I couldn't say no.<eos> She's more than a friend.<eos> I mean, come on, you used to fuck her. And now she's calling you for everything.<eos> What am I supposed to think?<eos> Jamie, I swear to you, there is nothing going on between me and Deb. Then why lie about it?<eos> Because I didn't think you'd understand.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> I don't.
How may I help you?<eos> [Southern accent] Hi, Stacy.<eos> This is Detective Cooper over at Miami Metro.<eos> My badge number is 143634.<eos> We're investigating a hit and run.<eos> We think somebody who rented one of your vans might have been a witness, so I was hoping to get some information over the phone.<eos> I can fax you over a copy of the warrant, if you'd like.<eos> Oh, I'll just get it for you.<eos> Do you have the license plate?<eos> Yes, I do.
Because I love your brother, and I--and I've learned how much he cares about you, and I didn't want to hurt him.<eos> He loves me too.<eos> Do you really want to hurt him?<eos> Fuck.<eos> My brother screws up everything.<eos> Oh, you're both still breathing.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came here for her.<eos> - But how did you--
This is hard.<eos> I've been thinking about what to say to you since last night.<eos> When you were surprised to see me?<eos> Did you think I was dead?<eos> No.<eos> I don't-- I don't know.<eos> I didn't know what to think.<eos> I'm so sorry about Paul.<eos> I loved him, too.<eos> No, you didn't.
I've been thinking about what to say to you since last night.<eos> When you were surprised to see me?<eos> Did you think I was dead?<eos> No.<eos> I don't-- I don't know.<eos> I didn't know what to think.<eos> I'm so sorry about Paul.<eos> I loved him, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I did.
Girl's sweet too.<eos> - Just say it's healthy. He- y.<eos> You remember this minute, all right?<eos> Might only come once.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I got me a baby.<eos> I'm sorry for the things I've done.<eos> And... for the things I left undone.<eos> Feeling like I bit off more than I can chew, you know?<eos> Course you do.
I'm an assassin.<eos> I have an employer.<eos> Listen...<eos> I received the names of everyone I killed for him.<eos> He pays me.<eos> I already told you you're a terrible liar, didn't I?<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> He sold me out.<eos> He never told me you was here.<eos> Who didn't?
Congratulations on your new job.<eos> It went well.<eos> - I was at TV1 just the other day...<eos> - We're ready for an extended interview with Nyborg tonight.<eos> Im sorry, she can't.<eos> You're sorry she can't?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we chose to give the first exclusive to TV2.<eos> It's important not to only do friends at TV1.<eos> Yeah, you did at least one friend at TV1.
Come on, bada-bing.<eos> Hey, broads, oh! Come on!<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Jules!<eos> Hey.<eos> You need a ride?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Dad, you know I love you, right?<eos> Well, of course I do, June-bug.
Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.<eos> We got our costumes in the trunk we could go there and have a little photo shoot.<eos> Great idea.<eos> I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks.<eos> These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.<eos> - It sounds fun.<eos> - Oh, smashing.<eos> Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, well, luckily, someone in the car does.
- From...<eos> - From the truth?<eos> Your sister, she's an incredibly dangerous woman!<eos> This will reverse everything I've worked for my entire life.<eos> Okay, so the temperature doesn't matter? No.<eos> Just do it quickly, before I change my mind.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> That didn't happen when you used it on...<eos> What the hell?<eos> No, it didn't.
Don't say a word.<eos> I track three Chinese vessels on intercept with the Colorado.<eos> I have lost contact.<eos> Colorado, this is EWS.<eos> Please respond.<eos> Colorado--<eos> Get out.<eos> This is a secure facility.<eos> Does Julian know what you're doing?<eos> Yes, he does.
Yes, you will.<eos> Tani, what happened?<eos> My brother discovered prospectors on our land.<eos> When they wouldn't go, he sent them running.<eos> They came back with guns.<eos> They beat my brother.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Do you still think you owe me something, James?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm all out of moves.<eos> So...<eos> I'm asking you as my friend...<eos> I can't do this with you here.<eos> You know I signed up 'cause I didn't know what else to do.<eos> You know that.<eos> I was just looking for something.<eos> I was looking for something, I was looking for anything... anything to believe in.<eos> I didn't know what to fight for.<eos> But I do now.
I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You don't gotta worry.<eos> He's a teddy bear.<eos> You know, underneath the violent.<eos> Let's go.<eos> * 'Cause I want you * ay, ohh * oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<eos> So I was gonna try to put the hook back in at the end again if you think that's a good idea.<eos> I do.
If I don't make it soon, it's not gonna happen.<eos> But think of what you're becoming.<eos> All for a couple of gold records?<eos> Will it be worth it?<eos> When I get the gold records, I'll let you know.<eos> Wow.<eos> You are not the girl I thought you were.<eos> I guess that means you don't want to go to dinner with me anymore?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I don't know.<eos> Hey, believe it or not,<eos> I've been where you are right now.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was 16.<eos> Got busted for possession, 1/2 ounce.<eos> [Chuckles] I was so scared.<eos> You smoke?<eos> I did.
Hey, believe it or not,<eos> I've been where you are right now.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was 16.<eos> Got busted for possession, 1/2 ounce.<eos> [Chuckles] I was so scared.<eos> You smoke?<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
[Laughs] I wouldn't be surprised if you did, after that bribe you offered me.<eos> I didn't offer you shit.<eos> I did you a favor.<eos> And then I asked for a favor, which you could do or not.<eos> Is that really what you tell yourself when you look in the mirror?<eos> If you're willing to break privilege, you're the one who needs to look in the mirror.<eos> Katrina Bennett called.<eos> The deal's done.<eos> Get the paperwork started.<eos> Harvey, what did you do?
I'm just-- I'm not sure going public is the best move right now.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Trust me, these aren't valid reservations.<eos> You're just getting cold feet.<eos> Harvey.<eos> I'll have Donna send you some fuzzy slippers.<eos> You'll be just fine.<eos> Are fuzzy slippers gonna stop the Title 16 ruling that came down Friday?<eos> You don't even know what that is, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
After the deal, they're just gonna sell it off for spare parts.<eos> That won't get them what they paid for it. But it'll get them what they wanted.<eos> - Trent.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Louis figured this out?<eos> Trent's contract has the same problem as Louis's.<eos> He's got a non-compete.<eos> They couldn't get him to run the company unless they bought his.<eos> Now Louis wants back in.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Your LSAT score?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I figured...<eos> You shouldn't keep things like this a secret.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> How did you know it was my birthday?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I must have told you once.<eos> You did, yeah.
Pew!<eos> How are you gonna fight that?<eos> Well, Al is blessed with a tall frame and thick hair.<eos> Yeah, it's like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger had a baby that then renounced his two gay parents.<eos> Did you... did you ever play any sports?<eos> A little bit... tennis.<eos> Early on.<eos> - Tennis, that's good.<eos> - But I... wrestling.<eos> I did a bit of wrestling in my day.
Mom, I saw his...<eos> I'll show you!<eos> Oh.<eos> So... she didn't run away.<eos> Ma, these are the boots that Boris saw.<eos> The killer wore these...<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> Those boots belong to Luther.<eos> Andrei had to make them fit somehow.<eos> Luther did...
- You're Danny's shrink?<eos> - Psychologist.<eos> Oh, I'm a lawyer.<eos> Almost.<eos> I'm sure people do this to you all the time, but I'm kind of going through this thing with this guy.<eos> I'm sorry, I really can't tell you what Danny says about you in our sessions.<eos> Oh, no, that's not...<eos> Wait, he talks about me in therapy?<eos> No, who said that?<eos> Uh, you just did.
So I fired her and asked her out.<eos> I'm sorry, wait.<eos> You fired who and asked her what?<eos> Amy.<eos> Dr. Shaw.<eos> We're still working on the name thing.<eos> This is really not where I saw this conversation going.<eos> Um...<eos> D-did she say yes?<eos> - She most certainly did.
Look at her.<eos> You're gonna look like a psycho.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Mm.<eos> See?<eos> I told you.<eos> Enjoy the view.<eos> Your husband did.
I didn't.<eos> Turns out, I don't actually own any.<eos> It's hard to walk around holding a bunch of cakes, so we decided that a "cakewalk" is something that's hard to do.<eos> Someone in a funk, they need to be "slapped out of it."<eos> And since "slim chance" means that it probably won't happen,<eos> "fat chance" means that it definitely will.<eos> Oh, and also you know how getting your ass kicked always sucks?<eos> Well, anything that's really terrible "kicks ass."<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - It doesn't.
My girl.<eos> Hey, Lyndsey.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I'm flying to New York City.<eos> A fashion show, maybe take in a musical.<eos> Ah.<eos> Guys' weekend.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Um, so anyhow, I just wanted to... make sure you still love me.<eos> Of course I do.
No.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> James!<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry, Jack.<eos> But I have a kingdom to run.<eos> I'm sure you understand.<eos> Anton... the poison.<eos> It's in my blood.<eos> Did you...
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they, um... they patched me up pretty good.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I overheard you talking about how you saw a guy with a ball of fire.<eos> And you think I'm crazy, too.<eos> Well, I did see it.<eos> I...<eos> Hey, I know that you're not crazy.<eos> You do?
- Hannah.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Not Paige, Hannah.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> - No, don't be.<eos> I was surprised that David had such a beautiful... just stunningly...<eos> You thought he was gay.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Hey!<eos> - Aha.<eos> Hey, T.O.!<eos> You're nuts!<eos> I do not understand why you can't be a little bit better to each other. Being an only child is extremely lonely.<eos> All I wanted as a kid was a sibling.<eos> Caroline, come on, you don't think your brother wants to have sex with you.<eos> No, not in a physical way, no. See, it was all a big misunderstanding, all right?<eos> So can't you just tell your sister you love her?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What, now?<eos> - I told you I wanted to.<eos> - Don't you wan to take charge?<eos> - Aren't I?<eos> It's your family's influence.<eos> Say it, midwife studies, it's to please your family.<eos> Do you really want to just palpate uteruses?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> - I mean, I don't know.<eos> - I do.
No.<eos> I stopped seeing him when I was pregnant.<eos> Did Dad ever wonder?<eos> No.<eos> Until Moira was born.<eos> When he saw that crop of red hair?<eos> He walked out of the birthing room and? when he came up he held her and said: "She's mine.<eos> "She's mine.<eos> We'll never talk about it."<eos> And we never did.
Give 'em the front room.<eos> We'll move our bed into Honorée's room.<eos> What, they gonna sleep on the floor?<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> Told you I'd make it.<eos> How's Yale, Miss Ivy?<eos> You know what they say...<eos> toughest thing is getting in.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Oh! And let me tell you one thing.<eos> I'll only tell you this once!<eos> He's very happy with Lulu.<eos> That's all that matters, so you can go.<eos> Lulu has three children waiting for her back home and I wouldn't want to start a fight with her husband.<eos> - Lulu?<eos> - I'm sorry but she has no ring.<eos> - Right! - She does have a ring.<eos> - No.<eos> - She doesn't? - No.
I think he hated losing even more than I did.<eos> When the mavs finally won that nba championship, he sent me a note.<eos> All it said was, "about time."<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> My gosh, would you look at those photos.<eos> You know, Sue Ellen, it's your fault I married him.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> You wanted him something fierce, as I recall.<eos> We all did.
I'm not lying.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Alan.<eos> All right, Pierce, make it quick.<eos> Your friend Victor's in some deep shit.<eos> - Vic.<eos> - Ike, go.<eos> Go back to your hotel.<eos> - Vic, we need to talk.<eos> - No, we really don't.
- Come on, man, wake up. - Tye!<eos> How'd I get...<eos> Ohh, it happened again.<eos> I thought I was dreaming. No dream. Trust me.<eos> I'm not here to hurt you.<eos> But you 4 need to go back to STAR.<eos> Look, I recognize you.<eos> I know you're one of the good guys, one of the heroes that saved us all from the Reach.<eos> - But, dude, you just don't get it.<eos> - No, Tye, I really do.
You know, it's a really filthy habit you got there.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> Hey, can I give you some advice?<eos> First, stay out of the Glades.<eos> And second?<eos> Don't fall for every sob story a guy like me tells the police.<eos> You have a great evening now.<eos> [Knocking]<eos> Do you ever take time off?<eos> I do.
Ring any bells?<eos> I was trying to persuade Uncle Roger not to marry Kim.<eos> She's a bloody gold digger.<eos> I know her type, and Uncle Roger...<eos> Well, he was getting old and easily manipulated.<eos> We're his family.<eos> We were just looking out for him.<eos> I tried to warn him, but he just thought I was after his inheritance, that I was afraid that he was going to leave the plantation to Kim.<eos> Of course, you didn't care about the money!<eos> No, I didn't.
Forget the dam.<eos> The 5 families are with me.<eos> Bravo.<eos> A political victory against the people's will.<eos> The victory of the eldest son.<eos> There's no eldest.<eos> Just 2 only-children.<eos> Don't make me cry.<eos> Why did you publish the photo?<eos> I didn't.
So, that's almost a belief in God.<eos> How is that almost a belief in God?<eos> I have a husband who believes in God<eos> - and a daughter who might...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And what about Zach?<eos> - eI don't know.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But the point is you could believe in God.<eos> But I don't.
Before or since.<eos> I used to think I knew you better than anyone.<eos> You did know me.<eos> But I am a completely different person now.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> Vince, I admit, with you back, it's all so confusing.<eos> I'm beginning to remember my old self, and I want that life back so badly.<eos> I guess the question is, do you?<eos> Want to go back in time to the way we used to be?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
That's a dead guy.<eos> The whole opaque skin tone thing.<eos> Who was he?<eos> Bike messenger that attacked a colleague of mine a few months ago.<eos> I think the creature intervened.<eos> Sample from the wound here should confirm it.<eos> Or if there truly is a creature roaming the city, is it possible that it could be cogent?<eos> I mean, wouldn't it have to have feelings and emotions and a sense of justice and morality to only be targeting criminals?<eos> Then why do you want to catch it so badly?<eos> I don't.
He's not gonna stop.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, Damon's gonna be back soon, and then we can figure something out.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You still trust Damon?<eos> He saved your life.<eos> He saved the map to the cure.<eos> He couldn't care less about me.<eos> I care about you.<eos> Don't.
Aigo, me too.<eos> Aren't you sick and tired of his voice really badly?<eos> That's what I want to say.<eos> Still, I am a little thankful to him for giving us special lessons.<eos> By the way, did Go Nam Soon and Park Heung Soo reconcile or not?<eos> Will it be easy?<eos> I pretended like I knew nothing, and spoke about it.<eos> Park Heung Soo was like jumping up and down.<eos> What?<eos> You did?
If you start thinking like a monkey - - You might see the problem in a different perspective .<eos> The point of discrimination it is everything is allowed to mess with . Right?<eos> By joking and joking together in such a safe and nice frame like this -<eos> - Do we like the sting from the scary words.<eos> Bring it here! Mocha Man ? !<eos> - Dude !<eos> - Bleikefis , it was fun .<eos> - Searing !<eos> - Potatoes !<eos> Do you?
But is that a reason to attack and blow them to hell?<eos> Sir, the Prime Minister is on the line.<eos> Tell him I'll call back.<eos> He wants to discuss his news channel to resettle our tuna-fishermen in the Seychelles.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Where were we?<eos> Talking about serious matters!<eos> Ah, yes. America.<eos> There, the hawks think they understand the world.<eos> But they don't.
Mr. Vlaminck?<eos> Hector Marlier, here.<eos> Hey, Hector Marlier!<eos> Alexandre said you were in deep shit, his words, and I could help.<eos> I don't need glory, just trying to help.<eos> Hector Marlier...<eos> Check him on the Internet!<eos> No Internet here. Really?<eos> You have no Internet?<eos> Even my grade school does!
So, uh... So what's changed?<eos> Well, I have.<eos> I forgive her now.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Casey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would anyone else like to speak, either for or in opposition to Ms. Casey's possible parole?<eos> All right, then, Ms. Casey.<eos> We'll start with a simple question.<eos> Do you feel remorse for your crime?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do...
And we had to put the paddles on him and... [clicks mouth] he pops right back up, like, no big deal, you know?<eos> I mean, he completed training.<eos> - I think he's over at 94. - [man laughs]<eos> Gave him the nickname "Dead Frank."<eos> I know where I heard that story before.<eos> You're the guy with the podcast.<eos> We love that podcast.<eos> Herrmann, right?<eos> He put you up to this.<eos> No, nobody did.
What can I do for you, Hank?<eos> Mark Cuban's upped his offer.<eos> The league's ready to move.<eos> Well, as I think you saw,<eos> Juliette is not in the mind-set to move.<eos> And it's that mind-set that's the problem in a nutshell, Nico.<eos> She disappeared after yesterday's meeting, and for all we know, she could be on another binge.<eos> Where is she, anyway?<eos> You got a problem, Donnally?<eos> We both do, Mr. Careles.
It's not me.<eos> It's her.<eos> Jill Werner is the most vapid, self-obsessed narcissist I have ever met.<eos> Well, nobody's perfect.<eos> Why are we eating syrup?<eos> Well, I didn't get the Greens.<eos> You want some on your Greens?<eos> - The Greens?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, dad, I don't.
The only one...<eos> That can show them the way.<eos> Just one more time, hank.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'll start with hank's computer.<eos> These are the files that hank gave me<eos> Of all the 41 trust subsidiaries,<eos> But we didn't find anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe hank did.
It's a secure facility. We need backup.<eos> We gonna need- but if we wait any longer-<eos> You are not the only worrying about losing someone today.<eos> You're right.<eos> Hey, hey, um...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let's do it your way.<eos> Earlier you called this one "the flawed model."<eos> I-I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
And I intend to make that happen.<eos> Doctor, pressure is falling.<eos> we should push fluids.<eos> put more in the drip.<eos> So what are the terms for this renegotiation?<eos> You make sure hank and I get off this island safely, And in return, I give you What you've always wanted.<eos> Does she have a message for me?<eos> Mm.<eos> I used to paint.<eos> Little hard to do around here so...
I'm sorry.<eos> We've run out of time.<eos> Laila, put the gun down.<eos> the locusts-it's a sign.<eos> He's telling me I have no choice.<eos> Or maybe he's presenting you with one.<eos> Isn't that what god does?<eos> He tests us, right?<eos> I tried to stop it, hank.<eos> I did.
- Okay.<eos> And we are gonna educate Natalie about the proper relationship between adult and child.<eos> Oh, Polly, hey.<eos> Hay is for horses, papi.<eos> Uh, you know, my kids...<eos> Uh...<eos> I can see them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did they see me?<eos> Yeah. We did.
- No, nothing.<eos> It's... well, something.<eos> I'm not gonna take another bath.<eos> My fingernails are coming off.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What was all your fault again?<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> Julian is so mad at me.<eos> Do I smell like cheese?<eos> - You do.
Spill?<eos> No.<eos> So you guys were...<eos> In, uh...<eos> Recreational fashion?<eos> What can I say?<eos> I have a soft spot for well-meaning, lovable, bearded messes.<eos> (Exhales)<eos> And I've got a soft spot right here.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mr. President.<eos> Sorry, I'm late.<eos> My aide drives like an Hawaiian.<eos> Well, uh, we won't waste a lot of your time, senator.<eos> We want your vote on my education bill.<eos> I didn't realize we were bringing our wives to the meeting.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Senator, we've had our differences, but you know that boys and girls in your state are gonna benefit from these investments in math and science.<eos> Well, of course I do.
Liar!<eos> - Shots fired!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Stay back! Stay back! Stay back!<eos> Stay back, stay back!<eos> Diane, Diane, there's still a way out of this.<eos> You never wanted me.<eos> Never!<eos> You lied!<eos> I didn't.
Thanks to him, 600 people have been stopped and imprisoned.<eos> Politicians, bankers, government workers, all corrupt. He has a price on his head.<eos> He's already escaped various assassination attempts.<eos> The elections are soon, then the World Cup.<eos> The world will be looking at Brazil.<eos> This is a race against time.<eos> If Medeiros' party wins, powerful people will have lots to lose.<eos> We must question him though.<eos> - He might have seen the murderers.<eos> - He didn't.
Oh, no.<eos> Honey, come on.<eos> The test is in two days.<eos> Nothing I do between now and then is gonna help my sperm count.<eos> Actually, I've been doing the research, and there's a lot you can do.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah -- lukewarm showers, loose boxers, plenty of sleep.<eos> Okay.<eos> I like to sleep...<eos> And I do like showers...
Try.<eos> That was the fertility doctor.<eos> Dale's sperm is okay, but...<eos> My My eggs may not be.<eos> The doctor said we only have a 10% chance of conception.<eos> You know what?<eos> There's got to be somebody in that 10%.<eos> And it is gonna be you and Dale.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Nobody does.
Which is why I think our understanding of the subconscious will evolve the more we learn about<eos> - the cognitive structures of the brain.<eos> - Very true.<eos> You know, I was reading about Freud, and his theory on the subconscious was fascinating.<eos> Freud?<eos> Excuse me, 1897 wired.<eos> They'd like their antiquated notions back.<eos> Well, they can't have 'em.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, after the show, we started fooling around.<eos> But just as we got to the sex part...<eos> Dale fell asleep.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> Kyle used to fall asleep all the time after sex.<eos> No.<eos> This was during sex.<eos> Oh. At some point, he just stopped moving and started snoring.<eos> Oh. Please tell me that this happens all the time. Just tell me.<eos> Yeah, it does.
- Why, sir?<eos> If the gang-members find out, they will shoot yöu.<eos> And if yöu have an encounter with the police..<eos> ..They will kill yöu too<eos> - Oh God!<eos> But why, sir?<eos> I'm working for the police.<eos> - Yes.<eos> yöu know it, I know it..<eos> ..But the police department doesn't.
You... look tired.<eos> Smith residence, Francine speaking.<eos> You silly, stupid girl.<eos> Hello, Betty.<eos> Does this mean you won't be coming to your only son's birthday party?<eos> There's a reason Stan hasn't celebrated his birthday since he was a child.<eos> Why couldn't you just leave well enough alone?<eos> Enough!<eos> You and I have a very strained relationship and we both know it!<eos> Oh, yes, we do!
But there's a Mad Pooper loose in the school.<eos> It's the job of the news to inform the public.<eos> It's worth it, even if we save just one shoe. Yuck.<eos> Well said, Tammy.<eos> (sighs)<eos> The Mad Pooper story is ten times bigger than Lenny Destefano's love life.<eos> And less disgusting.<eos> He'll put his lips on anything with pom-poms.<eos> But I can't get it out there. WSN has a news monopoly.<eos> So do your own newscast.
So he experimented on you?<eos> Carvel?<eos> It's in the manuscript.<eos> In the published version, the devil imprisons me.<eos> But in the manuscript, it's my father, holding me, like all the others, to use for experiments.<eos> I was hardly a living thing as far as they were concerned.<eos> They both deserve death.<eos> And you think this is going to make you feel better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
Or do you consider evidence as well?<eos> Somebody told us they thought you were prescribing Elise way too many drugs.<eos> Hmm. This... is a mild sleep aid.<eos> I was attempting to regulate Elise Vogelsong's sleep cycles.<eos> Balanced sleep cycles are a bulwark against dementia.<eos> This is widely known.<eos> Now I understand you must pursue all avenues of inquiry, but embracing the medical theories of laypersons...<eos> Does not seem productive.<eos> Did you approve of Elise Vogelsong sailing?<eos> I did not.
Really?<eos> That place was so creepy.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I-I'm worried we might have missed something because of that.<eos> Okay, fine, but no jumping out and yelling "boo" at me or anything like that.<eos> I mean, seriously, what do you take me for?<eos> I am not going to answer that because I'm a nice person.<eos> She paid through the month, but said she was going to visit a friend.<eos> Did she say where?<eos> No, she didn't.
I-I know it seems cold, replacing her so quickly, but the women at the shelter here, they--they've suffered enough.<eos> Their safety and security-- that comes first.<eos> Julia would have wanted that.<eos> How can we get in touch with Doppler?<eos> He'll be with us all day tomorrow at the Fairchild Hotel.<eos> That's where we're meeting to interview new candidates.<eos> Did Julia live in Sacramento?<eos> Jane, I'm in the middle of questioning.<eos> Yeah, it won't take long.<eos> Did she?
Change it as you wish.<eos> Shall we be safe, you and I, upon our thrones?<eos> While Henry is at large, there's always a chance of a Lancastrian uprising to put him back on the throne.<eos> Or his son, Edward.<eos> But when we have our son, we will be safe, for we will have an heir.<eos> And your own men, do you trust them?<eos> Lord Warwick?<eos> Him of all.<eos> I know he's brusque and has found it hard to deal with our marriage but he will learn to love you as I do.<eos> He already does.
Warwick?<eos> What threat is Warwick to us now?<eos> This is no joke, Elizabeth.<eos> It is certain.<eos> There are thousands of men-in-arms under Warwick's orders.<eos> He is king-making again.<eos> Oh, Issy.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Do you think George will adore me, Annie?<eos> The way that the King does her?
So you really don't want to date me?<eos> It's your last chance.<eos> Right from across the room.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> - What?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't know what I'm doing, Charlie.<eos> This has been the worst year of my life.<eos> - Look, I didn't know that.<eos> - Now you do, okay?
All we have to do is figure out which one of the guests had something to gain from stealing Josie's album.<eos> Here's a point. Five.<eos> Six. Seven.<eos> Eight.<eos> Rock one, two, three, four.<eos> Nice.<eos> Good.<eos> Point again.<eos> Did you guys not get the guest list that we sent over?<eos> Yeah, we... we did.
Not as many as you.<eos> All right, look.<eos> I really appreciate you trying to teach me all this, getting me assigned and every...<eos> Look, what I mean is, if you don't leave,<eos> I'll just go right back to clean crew.<eos> This your job.<eos> I know you like it here.<eos> Don't nobody like it here.<eos> Your hair looked good.<eos> It did.
[GIRL CRYING] JOSEPHINE [OVER COMPUTER]:<eos> We're in. Room's clear. Nobody here but a vic.<eos> I got him.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Call an ambulance.<eos> - On its way.<eos> She's in shock. I'll stabilize her.<eos> We'll leave her here for the paramedics.<eos> Please, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.<eos> Please, don't.
(Light chuckle)<eos> Phlebotomist?<eos> Well, I don't love needles or blood, but...<eos> I can learn.<eos> I'm tough.<eos> You are.<eos> I've been doing hair since I was 19 years old.<eos> I was just a little older than you.<eos> I don't know what's next for me.<eos> I... I really don't.
- I don't get it.<eos> - There's a lot you don't get.<eos> It wasn't just yesterday.<eos> If it bothered you before, why didn't you say anything?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> - Oh, at last!<eos> - Yes, talk to me.<eos> - You know what the problem is.<eos> - No I don't.
Now I snuck into Max's limo and rigged 12 hot plates and a ton of popcorn bags to the ignition.<eos> When he starts the engine, the limo will fill with delicious popcorn and we will laugh and laugh--<eos> Aah! Aah! Max is in there!<eos> Oh, God! , Oh, God! Oh, God!<eos> My sweet, sweet Max! Oh, my God!<eos> What happened? ! Oh, I killed my friend!<eos> His life was his art, and I killed him!<eos> I miss him already!<eos> I miss my dead gay friend!<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Okay?<eos> Everything that you've done to make it better has actually made it worse.<eos> So please stop.<eos> I think we should go.<eos> You should.<eos> Hey, Derek.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> There's no need.<eos> No, no, I do.
Says who?<eos> Well, three focus groups can't be wrong.<eos> So just give it a few days.<eos> You'll get used to you.<eos> You ready for the nurses?<eos> It means a lot to me, Derek.<eos> I know this is not you.<eos> I know this is a sacrifice, but the sale is our last shot, and I feel like I've been fighting this battle alone.<eos> And to have you in the fight with me... that means a lot.<eos> I don't, uh...
We can all see the screen.<eos> See the screen, dude.<eos> This is a private investigation!<eos> I wanted to talk to you about the... regrettable contact between Cece's... her-her down there and my, uh... my parts.<eos> You practically shish-kebabbed her.<eos> Is this something I should apologize for?<eos> Just let it go, man.<eos> You pogo'd her.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say, "pogo"?<eos> - I didn't, um...
Yeah, you're right.<eos> Screw Rodney.<eos> I hate that smiling little bastard.<eos> Look, I'd miss you.<eos> I like you.<eos> I like you like a brother.<eos> Yeah, so you can't kill yourself, all right?<eos> I'm not gonna help you kill yourself.<eos> I understand the desire, though.<eos> You do?
Yeah, they're blue.<eos> The good-looking girl will get jealous that you're not hitting on her.<eos> Hey, Kim.<eos> Look like you could use a drink.<eos> Uh, yes, please.<eos> A skinny girl Martini.<eos> Oh.<eos> Not that you need it.<eos> Yeah, it's a little late for that.<eos> You don't.
He's always been a fighter.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll have the oncologist in to discuss the process with you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Uh, Henry elected to do chemo.<eos> Huh.<eos> I actually didn't think he'd want to.<eos> He doesn't.
I'll figure it out.<eos> We put a BOLO out on McClenahan.<eos> Hopefully...<eos> Hopefully he hasn't left town yet...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Says he found McClenahan.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How'd you find him so fast?<eos> I didn't.
Eight lives versus thousands.<eos> Math still works.<eos> I'm amazed you still haven't worked it out.<eos> There really is no such thing as a secret.<eos> The plan, it's in a memo.<eos> It's been e-mailed back and forth.<eos> It was labeled "For eyes only."<eos> No one but the White House Situation Room has access to it.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> You do not!

That's not funny, all right?<eos> My-my life is falling apart.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
Exactly.<eos> By the way, how are we fixed for ham?<eos> ♪ Men.<eos> Alan.<eos> Wow.<eos> Oh, uh, hey-hey, Lyndsey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I've left you a few messages since yesterday.<eos> I don't know if you got them.<eos> I did.
I mean, shit. Well, you wouldn't find me on one of them websites anyway, you know?<eos> I mean, did you know that...<eos> - Colt!<eos> ...the NSA's got all kinds of things... Whoa. No!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Hold on, boys!<eos> Look, look, look.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I really do. I do.
But that's better than getting it wrong, isn't it?<eos> - Tell me I look pretty.<eos> - You look very pretty.<eos> You look pretty too.<eos> - Martini?<eos> - Please.<eos> - So you're not doing the trivia thing.<eos> - No.<eos> Brains are overrated anyway, right?<eos> They do as much bad stuff as good stuff.
Eight hours later...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> So, as far as Peter knows, he's about to cheat on you?<eos> Lois, you got to draw the line here.<eos> I know.<eos> There's a lot of crazy things I'Il let Peter get away with.<eos> I even held my tongue when he went through that anime phase.<eos> Hey, Lois, me make drive time to super fun Clam with noble Quagmire and wheel-monster Joe.<eos> Peter, what... Why are you dressed like that?<eos> What did you do to your hair?
He's still locked down.<eos> - We can't intubate.<eos> - Can you ventilate him?<eos> Barely.<eos> His SATs are still in the gutter.<eos> Okay, let's get him backboarded.<eos> We need to load and go.<eos> Seattle Pres is slammed, so they're diverting us to Redmond, but that's an hour away, and this kid...<eos> He doesn't have an hour, Jackson.<eos> He doesn't.
This isn't a haircut or some meaningless tattoo.<eos> This is my life.<eos> This is me.<eos> All right. You feel different.<eos> You want to belong. Okay.<eos> I get that, but you have your whole life ahead...<eos> I mean, what-what... what's the rush?<eos> I'm just asking for you to wait.<eos> Brian feels like he's dying inside.<eos> We both do.
Oh, he was an idiot.<eos> And now I feel like an idiot.<eos> We're just wandering around.<eos> We look like interlopers.<eos> Hey, you know, let's grab a cup of coffee.<eos> You always look like you belong when you're carrying a coffee.<eos> - Ah. - Yeah.<eos> No, walk with purpose.<eos> Don't look shifty.<eos> I don't.
Those are all worthless.<eos> I need some one-night-stand material, Ted.<eos> Oh. Oh.<eos> Here's your mom. Hello, Virginia.<eos> Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> It wasn't night and we weren't standing.<eos> Hey-oh! That didn't happen.<eos> You're right.<eos> It didn't.
So it is true.<eos> You really don't remember anything.<eos> Are we friends?<eos> We spent some time together.<eos> But I'm here because I believe you can help me find something that belongs to Rumplestiltskin.<eos> Wh... who?<eos> Mr. Gold.<eos> I, uh, I don't know him.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But you did.
The Captain's ship.<eos> The "Jolly Roger" instead of a car?<eos> It's the fastest vessel in all the realms.<eos> Well, that's great, but who's gonna captain it since the only guy qualified wants you dead?<eos> I can do it.<eos> Bae?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can do it.<eos> You know how to sail a pirate ship?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Yeah, apparently, you thought so.<eos> I...<eos> I forgot the guitar.<eos> Dallas, I'm sorry.<eos> There was so much going on.<eos> Remember?<eos> The... the... the 9:00 reservation was waiting?<eos> Look here.<eos> If for some reason you don't fancy a guitar signed by Deryck freakin' Whibley, you should just come on out and say so.<eos> I do, baby.

(Door creaks)<eos> Tessa's prematurely boring.<eos> - I beg your pardon.<eos> - See?<eos> I am scads of fun.<eos> Fun people don't say "scads." (Girls laugh)<eos> Tessa just turned 50 with her father.<eos> (Girls laugh)<eos> Really?<eos> I did?
Olivia does want she does when she wants, and no one dare question or ask for an explanation.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> I did things...<eos> Things that have affected your lives, made life hard for each of you.<eos> I need to apologize for all of that.<eos> I was wrong, and I'm very sorry.<eos> And it's time for me to come clean to you.<eos> To answer any and all questions you have.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Well, I do.

SHE'LL TOPPLE PRESIDENTS.<eos> SHE'LL CAUSE GLOBAL CONFLICT.<eos> SHE'LL WIPE OUT DIVISION WITHOUT EVEN BLINKING.<eos> - THAT'S TOMORROW'S PROBLEM.<eos> TODAY WE SAVE ALEX.<eos> - I'M ASSUMING IT'S NOT EVEN A CONSIDERATION THAT YOU'LL BE SIGNING MY DEATH WARRANT.<eos> - YOU SHOULD HAVE PICKED YOUR GIRLFRIEND BETTER.<eos> OF COURSE, YOU CAN GIVE US THE PASSWORD TO THE BLACK BOX.<eos> THAT'LL GIVE US A CHANCE TO NEGOTIATE, GIVE HER THE CODE WITHOUT TURNING YOU OVER.<eos> - YES, I CAN'T DO THAT.
You do that, you catch them both.<eos> Then what?<eos> I don't know, you make deputy director at 35 instead of 40.<eos> Does it get me back to D.C.?<eos> This is a marathon, Mike, not a sprint.<eos> All right, it's not about how fast you get back to Washington.<eos> It's about making sure you get back there in one piece.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hello. Chuckie, Briggs told me you had to rush out of Quinn's.<eos> How you doing?
I bet that's appropriate, right?<eos> Cue ball, my boat.<eos> Now we can forget about using the transponder because it's scrambled.<eos> So use a side-scan radar.<eos> A side-scan radar gives you a nice slice of the ocean in 3-d.<eos> For what you want, side-scan radar isn't reliable enough.<eos> Which is why I would use multibeam.<eos> Gives you a nice detailed view of the ocean floor.<eos> So when can we get started?<eos> We just did.
Men models!<eos> Men who model!<eos> -- permanent damage to my earballs because you're too chickenshit to take your candy-ass to the future and smash the defense grid so Skynet --<eos> - Whoa whoa whoa!<eos> Not cool, man!<eos> That is not at all cool!<eos> Rodney you mind your own dicky beeswax!<eos> You got another one in ya?<eos> Ew.<eos> - I don't --
All of them.<eos> And they all got 20 years, because not one of them not one of them gave me up.<eos> Anyway, I used our stash to buy a legit used car lot then my first dealership, and eventually--<eos> Six, yeah, got it.<eos> So the money is...<eos> The least I can do. It's like back pay for all the years they lost.<eos> Plus most of it is from charging poor saps for that freaking undercoating.<eos> Never get the undercoating.<eos> But I still don't know who keeps hiring goons to stick me up.<eos> Yes, you do.
It'll be some time.<eos> Eh, fine, fine.<eos> Get to cleaning this one as well.<eos> I'll be back later.<eos> All this because he tried to steal a magic wand?<eos> No, because he tried to steal from me,<eos> The Dark One.<eos> You try that, you get skinned alive.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Actually, no, they don't.
Well, as long as you broke into our room to spare my feelings...<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> He warned us about a woman.<eos> Yeah, which covers half the world.<eos> You roped the kid into this?<eos> She lied to me.<eos> Remember I had that thing with lies?<eos> You thought you had a thing with lies.<eos> I never bought it.<eos> Yeah, you did.
The Evil Queen.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was... the Queen.<eos> But now... here... you're nothing.<eos> And what are you?<eos> I'm... I'm just a man...<eos> a man on a mission.<eos> And all this just to try to find your father.<eos> I already told you, I don't know where...<eos> Yes, you do.
Not a single day went past when your mother didn't regret leaving you, Baelfire.<eos> We talked about going back for you when you were old enough.<eos> Perhaps fate brought us together so that I can make good on those plans.<eos> We can live the life that Milah wanted for us,<eos> - as a family.<eos> - No!<eos> Stay back.<eos> You used me!<eos> You wanted to kill my father!<eos> Yes. I did.
Bonsoir, Dixon.<eos> Where you off to now?<eos> That depends.<eos> On what?<eos> On what you'd want if I wasn't another man's wife.<eos> What do you want, Barbara?<eos> You.<eos> We had something special, didn't we?<eos> But you don't want this kind of life.<eos> You never did.
I'm gonna take care of our baby girl, Cy.<eos> (Exhales sharply) I love you.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> (Crying continues)<eos> (Door opens and closes)<eos> (projector and camera shutter clicking)<eos> (Tray closes, case clatters)<eos> (Presses button)<eos> (David) Why do you care what I do with the rest of my life?<eos> I don't.
(Phone beeps)<eos> (Buzzes and chimes)<eos> (Sighs)<eos> (Beep) Cyrus.<eos> I couldn't stop it.<eos> James is going to testify.<eos> (Woman) Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> Now it's over.<eos> (Phone beeps)<eos> I do.
I'm really here because I got stood up.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> - ♪ dun, dun, dun.<eos> That sucks!<eos> You know, I don't wanna offend you because I'm not that familiar With the lesbian community, But sounds like this bitch needs her ass kicked.<eos> Oh, I wish you would.<eos> The girl I'm seeing is such a girl.<eos> Oh, we were just supposed to be having simple sex, But she has feelings And she wants me to have feelings.<eos> And I'm supposed to be a bad person Because I don't have feelings.<eos> Which I don't.
I mean, we have cause of death but not enough evidence to arrest anyone.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> Yeah, sure, I just thought...<eos> Look, you're clearly dying to know what's been bothering me, so, fine.<eos> My brother bet me that, by the time I hit 29,<eos> I'd still be a loser.<eos> You're not a loser, Wendell.<eos> I know, I mean, I'm working with the best people in their fields, and they want me to work with them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Yeah, but... he's jealous.<eos> H-He's always wanted me to fail, so he wouldn't be the loser.<eos> How much does he owe you?<eos> 200 bucks.<eos> But I-I can't ask him for it.<eos> I mean, he works as a night watchman and he barely scrapes by.<eos> So after... years of working to prove him wrong, I can't get no satisfaction.<eos> You found something,<eos> Mr. Bray?<eos> Yes. I did.
Oh, they're beautiful.<eos> And happy Valentine's Day back.<eos> Mwah.<eos> Well, I stuck to our usual plan and didn't get you anything.<eos> Mm, well, the guys at the quarry had some weirdly strong opinions about what I should do for you for Valentine's Day.<eos> Aw, well, tell them thanks from me.<eos> (Water resumes running)<eos> I know I don't say it enough, but...<eos> You know...<eos> Uh-huh. I do.
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.<eos> Surrender her immediately.<eos> "Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"<eos> The records weren't tampered with.<eos> They just buried the truth under a lie.<eos> I've found it...<eos> My reality.<eos> Drive.<eos> The lieutenant colonel came to you to blow the whistle.<eos> Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto, νice-Minister of Defense?
I had friends, like...<eos> Matthew liked his school.<eos> We were kind of close to my parents,<eos> And the only thing that was missing was you.<eos> And then your assignment was finally over<eos> And you're back.<eos> Or... Some version of you is back.<eos> And then we just, you know, suddenly move here<eos> And start this whole life and... I thought you wanted me to take this job, To come to D.C.<eos> I did.
And I'm... Sorry.<eos> I like your shoes, by the way.<eos> They're new.<eos> Oh. Well, I like your new shoes.<eos> Earth to Clark.<eos> It's... it's just, in the past three months, um, the surveillance systems of five of the seven C.I. Agencies that we oversee have been compromised, and I-i am worried about the bureau's surveillance technology, Martha.<eos> I mean, it keeps me up at night.<eos> Do you think agent Gaad's on top of it?<eos> Well, agent Gaad thinks the new surveillance contractor is great.<eos> You don't?

I do.
Both of you are trying to convince me that you are telling the truth.<eos> I just want to find Stefan.<eos> You will only need so much.<eos> The rest I will take from you...<eos> Piece by piece.<eos> Birkhoff, I'm here.<eos> I don't see her.<eos> Nikita's comm, but no Nikita.<eos> Krieg, you don't want to do this.<eos> No, I truly don't.
She's not out here, George.<eos> Please tell me this is some kind of prank, and she's really hiding in your closet.<eos> No, no, she's-she's-she's out here.<eos> She's out here... somewhere. Uh, okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> Tansy, baby, I need you to, uh, just stay calm, okay?<eos> My baby, she is out there, alone. On the streets.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And we will-we will find her, okay?<eos> But what if we don't, George?
What?<eos> I'm getting excited now.<eos> Aren't they too cute?<eos> Don't you love her dress?<eos> Why did I just get an Evite to my own father's surprise party?<eos> I was waiting to surprise you, too, but I convinced Shelby to pop out of a giant cake I borrowed from Dash DeWitt and serenade Daddy with a sexy song.<eos> Magnolia!<eos> And don't even ask why Dash has a giant prop cake.<eos> I just somehow knew he would.<eos> No, you didn't.
- I won't.<eos> Look, I know this isn't exactly the... happy ending you envisioned for you and Jack.<eos> All that matters is that he's happy.<eos> Ems...<eos> There's no shame in admitting that your feelings about this marriage are... complicated at the least.<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> I'm happy that things are going Jack's way.<eos> He deserves it.<eos> And...<eos> Amanda does, too.
But faced with hard evidence, perhaps he can be convinced.<eos> Now do you have the documents or not?<eos> Aiden?<eos> If you're here to talk me out of this, I'm not interested.<eos> I'm not.<eos> How can I talk you out of anything if I don't know what you're thinking?<eos> If that video was made six years ago, and not three days like Helen said, then maybe it was never even real at all.<eos> Maybe they staged the whole damn thing.<eos> - I want to believe it, too, Aiden.<eos> - But you don't.
Mm. A little bit closer.<eos> How's this?<eos> Perfect.<eos> I can't find Carl's pacifiers anywhere.<eos> I think I left them on the boat along with my laptop.<eos> Well, mine's working just fine.<eos> We'll have these uploaded to photo-share by midnight.<eos> Do you think it's okay if we call and ask 'em where they keep the extra pacifiers?<eos> Do phones even work out there in the middle of the ocean?<eos> Yeah, the ship to shore does.
See, Ava?<eos> I been hiding this whole time!<eos> And I ain't said nothing!<eos> Did Shelby drop you off?<eos> Shelby ain't left.<eos> $150,000.<eos> For both of them?<eos> Each.<eos> Ellstin, we had a deal.<eos> We did.
Okay, so how else do I remind you of you?<eos> You grew up like me.<eos> You're an only girl in an alpha-male family business, so you were probably wondering how the hell you were going to survive without a penis.<eos> And then you were wondering how you were going to strike out and invent yourself.<eos> Ring any bells?<eos> Loudly.<eos> Now, look, raising money, even for worthy causes, is a bitch.<eos> But I'll let you in on a little secret.<eos> It is one of the few areas where men will leave women alone, because they know women are superior at it.<eos> They do?
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> (clears throat)<eos> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it?<eos> George Santayana.<eos> S-A-N-T-A...<eos> No, no, no, no, he's not in the puzzle.<eos> I just see that you're hitting your New York history.<eos> I got to protect this guy.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Show him some respect?<eos> You know, he told me what you said about his truck.<eos> I didn't say anything about his stupid beat-up truck.<eos> Right.<eos> You're not gonna ruin this for me, not this time.<eos> He's good to me, and he's good for me.<eos> Why can't you just let me have that?<eos> Let me be happy for once.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I screwed up your whole life by being born.<eos> Yeah, well, you did.
So, now you understand what I was saying when I hired you.<eos> No girl should ever have to do anything that makes her feel uncomfortable.<eos> This fistfight has complicated everything for Kyle.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it has, but I thought that you were gonna make a deal?<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, but prosecutors still want your husband to give up everything he knows about Vandermeyer, including Kyle's accomplice.<eos> I know this guy helped Kyle get clean.<eos> Wait a minute, h--<eos> His accomplice helped him get clean?<eos> I assumed you knew.<eos> No, no, I-I didn't.
Kitchen shears.<eos> Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know this kitchen really well.<eos> Like my own.<eos> Can we call a truce, please?<eos> I miss my best friend.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I don't know how things got this bad.<eos> Well, yeah, I do.
(Hisses) Your pressure's a little high.<eos> Jet lag. Whatever.<eos> Yeah, or stress.<eos> It can't help that Roland's going to Baltimore.<eos> (Scoffs) Does everyone on post know our business?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I don't like Roland talking behind my back.<eos> Joan, no one's talking behind your back.<eos> Roland just told me his plans because he thought you weren't coming home for a while.<eos> We all did.
Tanner just left the house.<eos> Tanner?<eos> Tanner!<eos> Hey.<eos> Didn't you hear me?<eos> Okay, what's going on?<eos> He hates me.<eos> Who?<eos> Eddie.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Go away.<eos> I know it hurts and I wish there was something I could do about it.<eos> I wish I didn't have to deploy so soon, before we could all bond as a family.<eos> Could you look at me a second?<eos> Please.<eos> I need you to give Maggie a chance.<eos> I'm serious, Caroline.<eos> She's a good person.<eos> She cares about you a lot.<eos> We all do.
If it's Robert, he has to pay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> [Cell phone ringing]<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> - I'm late.<eos> I'm... I'm getting your mom flowers.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Uh, storage.<eos> Storage.<eos> Where can I store things?<eos> All kinds of things.<eos> Like, important documents, my diary, that sort of thing.<eos> If you're looking for storage, this is your dream place.<eos> There's an incredible walk-in closet in the hallway outside the master bedroom.<eos> (gasps) Wonderful.<eos> George, why don't you ask Brayden that long list of questions that you have while I go take a quick peek?<eos> Yeah, but, honey, I don't...

Oh, my Lord, how are we gonna explain that we're in here?<eos> (gasps)<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Oh, hey, hey.<eos> I'm sorry, we got a little bit carried away.<eos> You know how it is when you're almost married.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> By any chance, would you want to show us the guest bedroom?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I do not.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> My phone ran out of juice, and you were right, I should do a better job of keeping it charged.<eos> I know that you left the bar last night with another woman.<eos> Doc, I was in a really dark place night.<eos> And I did leave the bar with someone.<eos> I walked a girl out to her car, all right.<eos> Her battery was dead, she said she needed a jump, and, yeah, you know, something could have happened.<eos> Maybe she wanted it to.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it didn't.
Wait, when did you...?<eos> See, I know for a fact that I exist because I am, well, me.<eos> So I can't possibly be just in your head.<eos> Therefore, the only logical explanation is that I am a magical being.<eos> What?<eos> A wonderful magical being.<eos> I've been around forever, and I will always be around forever.<eos> Okay, well, then how come when you first found the drawing, you didn't remember meeting me as a kid?<eos> Well, I don't remember not remembering that, so...<eos> Well, you didn't.
Cat's great.<eos> It was just time for a change.<eos> "Change." Really?<eos> Right after evidence was tampered with in a questionable suicide case you two handled.<eos> I've combed through every one of your cases.<eos> A page was torn out of a dead reporter's notebook.<eos> Last chance.<eos> Is there anything that you want to tell me about Detective Chandler?<eos> So... how'd it go?<eos> Uh, it didn't.
You probably think I made a devil's bargain.<eos> And maybe I have.<eos> But the program is the reason we haven't had another major attack.<eos> If the public knew about what we do, we'd lose that ability.<eos> And Aquino?<eos> Again, a regrettable decision, but a necessary one.<eos> No one life is above the safety of millions of Americans.<eos> That's the ugly math that I have to deal with every day.<eos> You of all people should understand that.<eos> I do.
Ed.<eos> You're not going to change Ed, so break this pattern. Let him go.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm gonna go get Ed back.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> One of my jobs as your therapist is to help build your trust.<eos> And in this case, I feel like I might have taken advantage of it.<eos> So you want me to come back, I guess.<eos> Yes, I do.
Did you have fun giving the clap to the entire backroom staff of the New York rangers?<eos> To get to level three, I need to invent a dance.<eos> Have you invented a lot of things?<eos> I want to invent a line of hair extensions called<eos> "Beweave it or not."<eos> How did you get up here?<eos> Mm. It's your dream.<eos> You obviously want me here.<eos> I don't want her here, Charo!<eos> Or do you?
Changed buildings.<eos> Sorry again.<eos> Target's headed your way, boss.<eos> Watch it!<eos> How'd you get back here anyway?<eos> Get lost. Get lost. Get lost.<eos> No, so I actually said to her,<eos> "Get your hands off my man, you bitch.<eos> Stay away from him."<eos> Yes, I did.
Look at it!<eos> That's terrorism.<eos> Do you want to avoid a life at Gitmo?<eos> I need your employer's U.P. address.<eos> Okay, wait, wait.<eos> Please.<eos> He only... he only goes by the letters "MC."<eos> We know that.<eos> Well, I don't know his name.<eos> Nobody does.
It's time to change the game.<eos> How?<eos> By not making it a game anymore.<eos> Well, that's not gonna be easy.<eos> Special Agents DiNozzo and David, I need you to strap in.<eos> We're about to start our descent into Camp Delta.<eos> You can't imprison me without due process.<eos> Beside, you don't have the resources to go that far off the grid.<eos> Not to mention the balls.<eos> Well, maybe we don't, but our bosses do.
Oh, well, that's nice.<eos> Should we get going on these witness interviews?<eos> Yes, I think first we're going to go and see, um...<eos> Ike Kramer.<eos> Don't you hate it when you write something down on a piece of paper and then...<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Ike Kramer.<eos> He's a, uh, trainer at, uh, one of Mr. Bishop's gymnasiums.<eos> Oh, good, so you have the address?<eos> Yes, I do.
Just, just tell us what you told them.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to hurt Mr. Bishop, I'm just trying to tell the truth.<eos> He had us in a meeting.<eos> He told us that if he caught anyone skimming, he would kill them.<eos> Those were his exact words?<eos> He would kill them?<eos> Not get rid of in the sense of fire?<eos> No, look, we all knew Christina was skimming.<eos> Bishop didn't know she was a CI.<eos> None of us did.
Hey, I've been really nice about following your orders, Senor Presidente, but if I can do something to help bring some people back or ensure that Liz, Maria, and I live to see another day, I'm gonna do it.<eos> take Bradford Alley all the way out of town.<eos> It's a straight shot.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Good luck...to all of you.<eos> I'll take care of her.<eos> I know how you hate when things get all goopy, so... Yeah.<eos> So I'll see you soon.<eos> - Yeah. - No.<eos> I will.
And I would happily exchange all that you see around me for the life that I had.<eos> Tell me that you feel nothing.<eos> My husband is asleep upstairs.<eos> Tell me that you love me.<eos> I loved you once.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You haven't forgotten.<eos> Tatyana, I beg you... be with me.<eos> You told me once that my heart would heal.<eos> So will yours, Evgeny.
Just as long as you'd like.<eos> Oh, the man is impossible.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - It's no good.<eos> He simply won't listen.<eos> - It seems it's up to me.<eos> - We'll all help you.<eos> Well, it's my problem, but you can all help if you will.<eos> - Oh, of course.<eos> - Of course we will.
-Yes!<eos> We'll make do. We have clothes, running water from a well.<eos> I am convinced these mutants will kill each other off--<eos> No, Calvin, we won't make do!<eos> Not me, not Adam ! We're going up!<eos> I don't care how horrible it is!<eos> We deserve it!<eos> I am the head of this household!<eos> I want him to see the sky!<eos> We will!
After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix end the war bring freedom to our people.<eos> That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix looking for him.<eos> I did what I did because I believe that search is over.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> You're going to need it.<eos> For what?<eos> Your training.<eos> Morning.<eos> Did you sleep?<eos> You will tonight.
- No, I want you. I believe this.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> I'll tell everybody.<eos> I'll tell your husband.<eos> Promise you'll never speak a word about me to anyone, not even Knorr.<eos> Why do you bring him up?<eos> Because I know he's a good friend of yours.<eos> But good friends with others too.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I will.
I'm scared.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> What can you be scared of?<eos> What's the worst fear?<eos> That you'll fall in the street?<eos> Someone will make fun of you?<eos> I mean, what?<eos> I'm afraid that women won't want to sleep with me anymore.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Some of them won't.
I think Fred Leuchter, when he was called upon, became one of them.<eos> I did this, but because of what I have seen, I have a compelling urge and perhaps a responsibility... to countless generations who come after me, a responsibility to the truth.<eos> Hear, hear !<eos> I thank you, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I hope I've lived up to your expectations. And I will entertain any questions.<eos> The Leuchter Report-- about 500,000 circulated in Germany.<eos> There have been translations. A Leuchter edition appeared in Russian. In Latvia, in Hungary, in Spanish.<eos> The Leuchter Report is out there in dozens of languages. and, I would dare say, in millions of copies.<eos> We will not go down in history... as being a nation of genocidal maniacs.<eos> We will not.
You must not die now!<eos> Shigekura-san!<eos> I must not die now.<eos> I will not die.<eos> Surrender.<eos> I will not!<eos> I cannot die.<eos> I cannot die yet!<eos> I do not want to die.<eos> I will not.
- I was scared to lose her.<eos> She is young.<eos> Healthy.<eos> Nothing bad can happen to her.<eos> If it does, I couldn't bear it.<eos> I lost my first wife and my son in a car crash.<eos> I thought I couldn't live without them, then I met her.<eos> It saved my life.<eos> But I couldn't experience it again.<eos> And it won't :
Oh, hi.<eos> This...<eos> So you got it.<eos> 20,000 yen, was it?<eos> I... ..I watched it last night.<eos> Mr Okazaki... you'll watch it, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> There's no point if I don't.<eos> Will you promise?<eos> Of course I will.
You let me worry about that.<eos> What were you talking about?<eos> Oh, it's nothing that can't wait.<eos> - Any better?<eos> - Buffers are stable.<eos> I wish she were here too, Constable.<eos> If we only knew where Kira was. If we could be sure she was all right.<eos> The Colonel is a survivor.<eos> This war, Captain. It has to end.<eos> And it will. Soon.
OK.<eos> I know you didn't. Just calm down.<eos> Just calm down.<eos> That's better.<eos> What the hell is she doing in strips?<eos> Well, go and get clothes here immediately!<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm sorry. This should not have happened.<eos> Happens all the time, didn't you know?<eos> Well, it won't in future.
- That's close enough.<eos> I'm warning you, I've been highly trained to put this through your heart.<eos> No mercy, no warning.<eos> I can kill you where you stand.<eos> Bring it on, then.<eos> Ow! You sissy kicker!<eos> (Xander) Cut it out!<eos> I'm so gonna bite you!<eos> - OK, stop, stop! We should stop, OK?<eos> - OK, I will if you will.
- Willow, are you OK?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I was too far away.<eos> It was lucky. She almost got hit.<eos> Willow, what's the matter?<eos> Maybe you should take her home.<eos> Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourself over.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.<eos> I will, though.
So maybe Andy's more open to your being a witch than you think.<eos> All right, back to work?<eos> Actually, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> And please don't be mad,<eos> - but I quit.<eos> - What?<eos> It's not that I don't appreciate the opportunity, because I do. It's just that every time I touch something at Buckland's, I risk having a premonition, and it's just too emotional for me.<eos> Besides, that's your world.<eos> I need to find one of my own.<eos> You will.
Sponge stick.<eos> Check another pressure.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm bleeding out.<eos> It always looks like more.<eos> How are we doing?<eos> Pressure's down 80 over 40.<eos> All right, let's pump in some saline.<eos> - I wanna see my baby.<eos> - You will. Just a little while.
'Cause it blows your hammock to Oyster Bay.<eos> Family portrait photo.<eos> - Who wants that?<eos> - I think Ma does, okay?<eos> I think I was reading the signals loud and clear.<eos> Yeah, and what were the signals, Ray?<eos> She said...<eos> "Raymond, I would really love a family portrait photo... instead of something useless like a hammock."<eos> - She did not say that.<eos> - She will.
Shut up !<eos> All of you, shut up !<eos> Somebody talk to me.<eos> The virus was inside of you and now it is inside one of them.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What do you mean, the virus was in me ?<eos> It wasn't ever in Rygel. It was in Chiana.<eos> She passed it to you.<eos> I don't remember a thing.<eos> And you won't. Neither will you, John.
Are you now the arbiter of our justice system as well ?<eos> The Nebari practise mind control ?<eos> We simply eliminated those thought patterns that led him to behave inappropriately.<eos> Eliminated ?<eos> A process of neural realignment, so intricate that each subject must be placed under cryonic suspension.<eos> So it is the real Durka ?<eos> And what does each subject feel during this ... this treatment ?<eos> Durka appreciates what we did for him.<eos> Ask him if you don't believe me.<eos> Perhaps I will.
Hey! ... What about me?<eos> - Keep silent, Rygel!<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I demand better treatment!<eos> You dare serve me with this grotesquery of a bowl!<eos> My apologies... your Eminence!<eos> I should think so...<eos> So, Jotheb, your subjects came up with your ransom?<eos> It was not in doubt...<eos> Why, yours will not?
He's an escaped mental patient ...delusions of royalty.<eos> You're the mental patient! If you expect anybody to believe...<eos> - He's not insane!<eos> - I could be!<eos> Okay, right, no he's not insane, but... he is sick... He's very sick... very contagious!<eos> You ever hear of chicken pox?<eos> He's not sick.<eos> Right, he's not sick, but he's... ...but he is worthless.<eos> - No one is going to pay his ransom!<eos> - The Consortium of Trao will!
No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!<eos> That's a hernia.<eos> Why'd I have to start working out again?<eos> Damn you, 15s!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Look, I was nervous.<eos> You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.<eos> I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.<eos> Yeah, and not a very good one.<eos> Will you, please...?
But I know I will never stop searching until I find out.<eos> I will continue to write, Tom, sending my letters through her... waiting to hear from you.<eos> To begin again.<eos> To wipe the slate clean.<eos> Wouldn't Jefferson or Hamilton... or Madison do the same if they could see their legacy now?<eos> What their beloved country has become?<eos> Long live the new monarchy.<eos> Did we find the leak?<eos> - How this woman knows about Hobbes? - No.<eos> We will.
Well, I wish we could stay longer, but we've got a plane to catch.<eos> Thanks again, major.<eos> I'll send you a letter as soon as I get to my grandparents'.<eos> - You better.<eos> - I will.<eos> - And a picture of me riding a horse.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Go on, you.<eos> Be good.<eos> I will.
Be a good little doggy.<eos> - Your job's supposed to be...<eos> - Sing for your supper.<eos> Beg, doggy!<eos> - This has nothing to do...<eos> - Beg, doggy, beg!<eos> - Your job...<eos> - Beg me, Ross!<eos> No!<eos> No, I won't!
- You let him go?<eos> We had no evidence, and that's not what I meant.<eos> You attacked him.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> You attacked a man in my custody.<eos> Forget he's not pressing charges, I have to report it.<eos> - So report it.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Of course I won't.
What's the Group's involvement?<eos> - Group intelligence kept casualties down to...<eos> - Another lie!<eos> Then stop asking me questions you know I can't answer!<eos> Will you help me find her?<eos> - That's what I've been doing.<eos> - But I'm asking you.<eos> They can't know about it. The Group can't know.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
Not anything.<eos> I didn't get into this to be a delivery boy, even for you.<eos> Emma...<eos> I see what I'm allowed to see.<eos> Just like everyone else.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> Neither did Jordan.<eos> Not clearly.<eos> Not this time.<eos> But she will.
- For fun.<eos> - And how you kill 'em?<eos> - Take a guess.<eos> You slit their throats.<eos> - Why you fucking with me, man?<eos> - I ain't fucking with you.<eos> You up in Oz for armed robbery.<eos> That I am.<eos> I never got caught for the murders.<eos> - And never will.
Why not?<eos> [Shower Running] Use all the hot water, and I'll kill you.<eos> Mama, will I ever find someone to love, like you found Daddy?<eos> I think you will.<eos> I know it isn't easy living with somebody like me.<eos> I have more baggage than an airport.<eos> But I want this to work.<eos> I'm committed... to making you and me work.<eos> So... if you still want me to come to Portland with you...<eos> I will.
I mean, second thoughts.<eos> Because committing to someone is hard enough without having to wonder if... they're even gonna be here tomorrow.<eos> Hey.<eos> You should eat.<eos> I didn't know how much you like, so...<eos> I care about him too, you know.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But Max and Michael are all I have.<eos> - And if I lose them...<eos> - You won't.
Julian, you are beginning to annoy me.<eos> Darts, racquetball, Vic's lounge, the Alamo...<eos> Need I go on?<eos> I love my wife.<eos> And I love Ezri.<eos> Passionately.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Have you told her?<eos> - Not yet. But I will.
I guess we stay.<eos> All right.<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Brother Teal'c, at precisely 6.03pm tomorrow, we're going home.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Your theory is confirmed.<eos> Where do we have to be for tomorrow's flare?<eos> Washington, DC.<eos> We're almost there, sir. We must find a power source right away.<eos> We will.
The reinforcements should come soon.<eos> We could detonate the C4.<eos> No, Trofsky is gonna start shooting any minute. We gotta buy some time.<eos> - He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> They will... They will.
- Ship?<eos> - There is no Stargate on Netu.<eos> Those banished there are taken by ship.<eos> Have I mentioned to you that I hate surprises?<eos> We have a long journey ahead.<eos> There'll be much time to inform you of all the details.<eos> Now, see, that puts me in a position to be surprised.<eos> Chevron seven is locked.<eos> Major, you will bring your father back safely.<eos> Yes, sir. We will.
- We've come to see Bynarr.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> People of little consequence.<eos> Pay no attention to us.<eos> - Kneel before me.<eos> - Who's this guy?<eos> He is Na'onak.<eos> First prime to Bynarr, Lord of Netu.<eos> - We've come to see Bynarr.<eos> - You will not!
You know as well as I do that the rules forbid entry or exit of the sector... ..before the final challenge, wounded or not.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Apophis would be disappointed in me if there were an exception made for myself.<eos> What if I told you we were bringing you to see Apophis personally?<eos> To show blood has been shed and your quadrant is truly ready for his return?<eos> If we don't bring you back, he will know you failed our challenge and never return.<eos> - Then I must go.<eos> - Good.<eos> Tell him we will make him proud.<eos> I will.
- No.<eos> You killed... because you could.<eos> You may have resisted it at first.<eos> You may have hated what you've become.<eos> Eventually, it took you over.<eos> That's where the tranquillizer came in.<eos> I found traces of etorphine in animal blood at the clinic.<eos> You injected yourself with the tranquillizer hoping to stop the killings.<eos> But they didn't, and they haven't.<eos> And they won't.
I want love at first sight, or nothing at all.<eos> Love at first sight?<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> The son of your deceased friend Zarija dropped by.<eos> He came for help.<eos> All his money is being stolen.<eos> I've got a score to settle with those villians, with Little Grga.<eos> We'll skin them like cats and eat them alive.<eos> I'm coming with you. I want to see the grave of Zarija.<eos> As you will, grandad.
We must all meet our Maker. To this end we must all come. Even Venetians.<eos> You can be saved, my brother. It's your desire that makes you weak.<eos> You can cure me of my desire young idealist?<eos> No. I can't.<eos> Tonight's too many hours away.<eos> My affections aren't mine to give you tonight.<eos> What?<eos> I have mouths to feed like you.<eos> I'll support you.<eos> No. There will no money between us.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Because I've had it.<eos> I'm taking my children and I'm getting out of here.<eos> What do you mean your children?<eos> They're my children.<eos> How about our children?<eos> And you think I'm just gonna let you take them away from me?<eos> There's nothing you can do about it and you know it.<eos> We'll see what a lawyer has to say about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Serial killers strangle, not siblings.<eos> I mean, they're girls, all alone, unattended here.<eos> Ben, I really know what it's like to be a single parent.<eos> I remember when I was a kid, I hit my brother over the head with a hammer.<eos> If I'd killed him, my life would have been very different.<eos> Ben, it's a very big house.<eos> And you need somebody here.<eos> I'm right around the corner.<eos> Just call me if you need help.<eos> I will.
You're not welcome.<eos> I hear O'Connor had to close down.<eos> A hundred people lost their jobs... ordinary, decent skins, because of you.<eos> Man of the people.<eos> They can go on the dole, like I have to.<eos> Robin Hood, is it?<eos> You scumbag.<eos> I've been asking for a team to keep you under 24-hour surveillance.<eos> They wouldn't give me the funds.<eos> Now, with this, they will.
Or reconsider.<eos> But there is no such reason.<eos> And we are out of time.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Tell me... Tell me what to do.<eos> The truth points to itself.<eos> What?<eos> The truth points to itself.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> You will.
Even if you never come back.<eos> I just don't want you to forget about me.<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> -Here.<eos> -What's this?<eos> Lots of stuff.<eos> A meat loaf sandwich... And a hard-boiled egg... and some marshmallow rice squares.<eos> There's some fried chicken in there, too.<eos> Don't skip dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.<eos> I won't.
Curt Wild, founder of the influential garage band The Rats... came from the aluminium trailer parks of Michigan... where rock folklore claims far more primitive origins.<eos> According to legend, when Curt was 13, he was discovered by his mother in the family loo...<eos> "servicing" his older brother... and promptly shipped off for 18 months of schock treatment.<eos> The doctors guaranteed the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him.<eos> But all it did was make him bonkers... every time he heard electric guitar.<eos> They despised him.<eos> But when you're abused like that... you know you've touched the stars.<eos> I just wish it'd been me.<eos> Wish I'd thought of it.<eos> You will, luv.
Okay, try it.<eos> Suzie, you need a lift?<eos> - We got room for one more.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Where'd she get those shoes, Whores For Less?<eos> Try it again.<eos> Nice to see you kids gettin' along.<eos> Whoa.<eos> - Don't forget Sunday.<eos> - I won't.
And now, to be back at the beginning with nothing!<eos> This is different.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You're right to want to quit.<eos> You should get as far away from me as you can.<eos> You won't die because of a hollow cause of mine!<eos> Go be a doctor.<eos> Go be a doctor while you still can.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Look at all this hardware.<eos> Technological superiority.<eos> Dibs on the chain saw.<eos> Falling in, sir.<eos> Out of the way.<eos> It's only a flesh wound, sir.<eos> Rest easy.<eos> You've done your job.<eos> Did we win?<eos> We will.
You don't need a husband to have kids.<eos> And besides, you were the one who always had my heart, you know?<eos> Yeah, I guess I did know that.<eos> Would you keep these for me?<eos> Your fairy tales?<eos> Yeah, some. A few.<eos> Plus all the other crazy shit in my head.<eos> I don't want to throw it away. I just don't want it around right now.<eos> - You can read it if you want.<eos> - No, I won't.
he's gone.<eos> hello? hotel security.<eos> hi, how are you?<eos> y'all didn't hear me knocking?<eos> no, we heard you.<eos> mmm, yeah. you guys making a lot of noise tonight.<eos> what is it, a toga party?<eos> it's a bachelor party.<eos> well, y'all going to have to keep it down.<eos> well, we will. we will.
So what do you say we go to mi casa, smoke some eska, get naked?<eos> What do you think Bobbie, wanna get naked and bump dick heads?<eos> Fuck you, Melvin. - Fuck you.<eos> - Want to rub the helmet?<eos> You never know until you try.<eos> I know man, I know.<eos> Mel, since when you start running with niños anyway?<eos> Since he stopped running with faggots. Hey come on.<eos> This is business here.<eos> Fucking cool out, will you?
I could see he hadn't recognized me.<eos> He didn't recognize his own daughter.<eos> He said, "How could I have forgotten such a lovely girl like you?"<eos> I told the rat I'd made a mistake and left.<eos> I heard he died soon afterwards.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - What did I do?<eos> You'll soon forget me too.<eos> I don't want to forget you.<eos> Even so... you will.
- I know that.<eos> All I am trying to say is that he has got a treasure in you.<eos> He must look after it.<eos> Did you lose somebody?<eos> Is that why you sound so upset about me and Howard?<eos> Do you take milk and sugar?<eos> - Just sugar.<eos> Did you?<eos> Do you want me to find Howard?<eos> Because I will.
-She was cardboard.<eos> Yeah, but she was still a girl.<eos> The only one we have, and he rips her head off!<eos> Even like that, she looks good.<eos> Let's go see your brother and his gun.<eos> -You can always shoot Manu.<eos> -And today's Saturday.<eos> His girlfriend might show up.<eos> -What if your sister comes?<eos> -She won't.
Here's the $1 00,000.<eos> Please check it.<eos> You think he can kill Jeffrey?<eos> Boss, Sidney Fung is here.<eos> What if he betrays you again?<eos> I'd still consider him my friend.<eos> He was so good to me.<eos> - Where isJeffrey's money?<eos> - Where the hell is he? I wish that I had a friend like you.<eos> You will, one ofthese days.
- l was hoping to talk to you.<eos> - You had better talk quickly.<eos> Governor Makena's motorcade was ambushed on his way to negotiations.<eos> Hawaiian Separatists have issued a declaration ofindependence.<eos> Mr. Ramzey, you have a visitor.<eos> Let her in please, Edgar.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I assume, I can thank you for the men who are shadowing me.<eos> is someone shadowing you?<eos> I will just...
Forget that lie.<eos> Tell me a lie about me.o<eos> What lies can I tell about you?<eos> That I'm very beautiful. I'm wonderful, and so on.<eos> You're very beautiful, wonderful, and so on.<eos> You do lie beautifully.<eos> At home, everybody must be waiting for us.<eos> To see if we say yes or no.<eos> So if you don't like me, you can say so.<eos> So will I. But a yes...
Mm-hm. Sasha.<eos> Ten bones.<eos> What? Ten? No.<eos> I only borrowed four. Interest, honey.<eos> I'm running a business, not a charity.<eos> Oh, come on, Carface, it's Christmas Eve - a time of giving.<eos> Hm? Hm? Then gimme the eight bones you owe me.<eos> It's not due yet, you tightwad, so I'm not payin' now.<eos> You'll pay now, Charlie.<eos> In fact, you all will.
What?<eos> Captain E_ will be waiting under the flyover, wearing a black hat and a blue jacket and carrying a yellow bag.<eos> Yes?<eos> Right, dear.<eos> I'm wearing a school uniform, and carrying a black rucksack.<eos> How cute!<eos> Do you go to Seishin Girls School?<eos> No.<eos> Fu_zball is worried that you mightn't come.<eos> Um..., I will.
Satoshi.<eos> Now that the scientists of the world are frantically collecting organic data you have created a self-awakening program.<eos> Listen to me, Satoshi.<eos> What led me to create this program was your mother's death.<eos> I wanted to know if I could record the mind<eos> and replay it like film or video tape.<eos> At that time I came up with the idea of copying the brain to make the Album of Souls.<eos> As long as you possess that tragedy will be repeated.<eos> That program...<eos> I will...
And now, to be back at the beginning with nothing!<eos> This is different.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You're right to want to quit.<eos> You should get as far away from me as you can.<eos> You won't die because of a hollow cause of mine!<eos> Go be a doctor.<eos> Go be a doctor while you still can.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
HOW ARE YOU ?<eos> WE'VE ALWAYS WALKED HOME TOGETHER FROM SCHOOL, LAIN.<eos> DO YOU REMEMBER ?<eos> Yes.<eos> I JUST ABANDONED MY FLESH.<eos> I KNOW THAT I'M ALIVE.<eos> DO YOU UNDERSTAND ?<eos> I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW, LAIN<eos> YOU'LL SOON KNOW.<eos> THE OTHERS WILL, TOO.
- Oh, yeah, campaigning.<eos> Rough gig.<eos> Just because you were Guacamole Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.<eos> Obviously, it involves handing out lame flyers.<eos> No.<eos> It involves being part of this school and having actual friends.<eos> Now, if it was about monsters, blood and innards, then you'd be a shoo-in.<eos> - I'd like to see you try to win the crown.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Then you will.
We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!<eos> - Have you dropped any hints?<eos> - I've dropped anvils.<eos> Oh, he'll come around.<eos> What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?<eos> At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.<eos> None of them know a thing.<eos> They all get an F in Willow.<eos> But I want Oz to get an A. And oh, one of those gold stars.<eos> - He will.
I'm talking to your father-in-law, Son.<eos> - I know, and I wish you wouldn't.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm cool that Abby's been with other men.<eos> It's not like I didn't have mywild days too.<eos> Yeah. You dated Mama Cass, right?<eos> I drove her home from the Fillmore one night... when she passed out.<eos> Finkelstein, ifiyou're so all-fiired cool about this Salazar guy... why don't you come on down to the opening?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Fine. I will.
It's always the mother's fault. Even if she doesn't wanna have the children in the first place.<eos> That was a trick question.<eos> But I think I've got it, sneaky.<eos> If you live in a glass house there are no bricks to throw.<eos> Right?<eos> - Dr. Greene?<eos> - Yes. Okay.<eos> I've got Corey-Bloom Acta Neurologica Scandinavia McLaughlin, Sandison and Flostein.<eos> Thank you. I'm off at 12, but you're welcome to stay if you need to.<eos> I will.
-Now. -Yes.<eos> -I do.<eos> Is it too late for that own vows thing?<eos> -You want to say something?<eos> -Yeah, I need the ring.<eos> You're little.<eos> I'm sorry I've been such a jerk.<eos> And I promise not to be one anymore.<eos> If you'll help me.<eos> I will.
-Yeah? The hell you are.<eos> When I find him, I'm gonna blow him out of his--<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> Josiah.<eos> Chanu got loose.<eos> Damn near killed Vin.<eos> -Posse?<eos> -Not if Vin can find him first.<eos> Chris sent me here to back you up, in case Chanu comes here.<eos> He won't.
Every time I get roped into this I tell myself it'll be the last time.<eos> Don't we all?<eos> Cully coming over, is she?<eos> Never misses if her mother's in it.<eos> She um... has she brought any boys home yet?<eos> Who, Joyce?<eos> Yeah. One or two.<eos> I wish David would...<eos> He's not getting any younger. I'd be happy just to see him going out with someone.<eos> Well, he will.
Day of the race, I was so bad. I could barely hold the wheel. That I asked Jimmy to cover for me.<eos> I've seen cases like yours. It's treatable.<eos> Yeah, I will take care of it later.<eos> It's time to think Jimmy.<eos> I messed up, Jarod.<eos> I let down my father and almost killed my little brother.<eos> You didn't know that Brinkman messed with the engine.<eos> I know now.<eos> I am going to do everything I can to make it right.<eos> We all will.
I think we should get to the airport. People might be looking for us.<eos> So, Potts, you would have us believe that you can dematerialize. That somehow the atoms in your body vaporize into molecules which are then magically transported to another plane.<eos> There's no magic involved.<eos> I deatomize here, and I reatomize somewhere else.<eos> Well, I'm sure we'd all like to see that. Wouldn't you, Mr. Mallory?<eos> I don't think you can call what I do deatomizing.<eos> Okay?<eos> I jump into a vortex, a wormhole that takes me through a tunnel that leads to another dimension, another world.<eos> Well, I'm sure we'd all like to see that, too, wouldn't we?<eos> Maybe you will, wise guy. Maybe you will.
Order some nozala sandwiches.<eos> Computer accessed.<eos> Get them to deliver some extra vilm sauce.<eos> Who should I bill this time?<eos> I don't care who pays for it just so long as it isn't us.<eos> How about the police? No.<eos> We billed them for last night's dinner.<eos> Municipal sanitation?<eos> Do you have their account code?<eos> I will... in a minute.
I told you.<eos> I wanted to see for myself.<eos> You procured the disruptors for us?<eos> That's right.<eos> We're going to ask you to do something else... something very important.<eos> You can count on me.<eos> I hope so.<eos> We'll contact you when it's time.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> I won't.
- Last time I checked.<eos> Would your government allow us to set up a hospital there?<eos> Too many wounded are dying on the way back to Romulus.<eos> - I'll ask the Council of Ministers.<eos> - I'd appreciate anything you can do.<eos> Get him talking but don't mention Jadzia.<eos> Let him do that.<eos> - He doesn't want to talk about her.<eos> - He may not want to, but he needs to.<eos> - In the right circumstances he will.
Thank you all for coming.<eos> It means a great deal to me to see so many people cared about Morn as much as I did.<eos> I'll never forget the first time he walked in here and sat down on that very stool.<eos> It must've been almost ten years ago.<eos> He still had his hair then.<eos> I thought he was just another customer passing through.<eos> Little did I know... he'd become such an important figure in my life. ln all our lives.<eos> Morn was always someone we could count on for a cheerful smile and an entertaining story.<eos> You might think this place won't be the same without him.<eos> And it won't.
Let him talk to me.<eos> Your friend had a feeble mind.<eos> It suffered greatly and gave in easily.<eos> Come on, Skaara.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Try!<eos> Perhaps I will not kill you.<eos> Perhaps you will make a good host yourself.<eos> All right, promise me this thing won't kill him.<eos> Two shots will.
Hang on a second, Daria.<eos> Hellooo.<eos> No, that's not a counteroffer, it's an insult.<eos> I will talk to you tomorrow during office hours. Good-bye!<eos> Okay, now, what are the other students writing?<eos> This is an extra assignment just for me.<eos> A punishment for being smart.<eos> Now, come on, Daria,<eos> I'm sure you'll do a great job if you just put your mind to it. You are very, very wrong.<eos> Sure you will.
-Hey, you know what would help me? -What?<eos> -If I could practice on all of you.<eos> Yeah, we got enough for a class right here.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> -Good night.<eos> -No. Stop!<eos> Let me walk you home, Dad. It's dark out.<eos> Robert, if you want to run some things by me, I'll be happy to help you.<eos> And I'll help you, too, dear.<eos> And Frank will, too.
Hello, how are you? Hello.<eos> How are you?<eos> Lain, I walked home with you just once.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I have only given up my body.<eos> By doing this, I can explain to you that I am still alive.<eos> I wanted to let you know this, Lain, so I sent this e-mail to you.<eos> It's okay if you can't right now.<eos> You will all understand soon.<eos> Everyone will.
This one's yours.<eos> Do I have to love, honor and obey?<eos> Just obey.<eos> It's OK.<eos> There's no need till death do us part.<eos> Let me see you kiss.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> I know you will.<eos> You've got to become Peter and Sage.<eos> We will.
- Karen, you have to.<eos> - I can't!<eos> Go again!<eos> Commence sequence.<eos> Sequence complete.<eos> This exercise isn't about shooting. It is about getting shot.<eos> You will eventually.<eos> It's what you do after that, that's what matters.<eos> - I'm not going to make it, am I?<eos> - Yes you will.
Pet shop, eh?<eos> Well, I just have one question.<eos> What pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1 a. M?<eos> The best damn pet shop in town.<eos> Yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> But you people remember baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet but they grow up. Let's go, boys.<eos> Those gears down there really hurt.<eos> You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron, and I'll find you.<eos> No, you won't.
Even your own people.<eos> Cardassia was on the edge of an abyss, Major.<eos> The war with the Klingons left us a third-rate power.<eos> My people had lost their way.<eos> I've made them strong again.<eos> At what price? You sold Cardassia to the Dominion.<eos> Yes... a high price, to be sure.<eos> But look what we're getting in return. The Alpha Quadrant itself.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
O'Neill!<eos> The Nox woman.<eos> Where'd the Nox go with Lya?<eos> Who knows where they ever go.<eos> I trained him well.<eos> - Is he gonna be alright?<eos> - Well, if it were you or me...<eos> My wound will heal.<eos> We must find Shak'l.<eos> We will.

Where is she now?<eos> Dr Scanlon isn't coming back?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so, Penny.<eos> Dana I want you to get well.<eos> You've been such a comfort.<eos> You've got to be the one.<eos> You can't give up hope.<eos> I haven't.<eos> I won't.
That will have to be proven... if we find him.<eos> When we find him.<eos> Something was done to you.<eos> Something you're just beginning to remember.<eos> You can't quite figure it out, but it can be explained, and it will be.<eos> And no matter what you think as a scientist or a doctor there is a way and you will find it to save yourself.<eos> Mulder, I can't kid myself.<eos> People live with cancer.<eos> They carry on.<eos> And so will I.
It's me - Leo Danzinger.<eos> I saw you, man.<eos> Where are ya?<eos> Behind you.<eos> I...<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> That's what they told us.<eos> That's what they wanted you to believe.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
You were in there.<eos> You were controlling my bodily functions.<eos> That's not something I do for everyone.<eos> No, you don't often let people see who you really are,either.<eos> I was in there.<eos> I know.<eos> Despite all your bluster and bravado,<eos> Autolycus, you're a nice person.<eos> I knew I could trust you.<eos> I always will.
Athena.<eos> Speak to me.<eos> No tears.<eos> No tears.<eos> He is strong like you. He doesn't cry.<eos> - Promise me you will return.<eos> Troy does not fall so gently.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Penelope, If I cannot return...<eos> - You will!
When you went after my girl, that was entirely unacceptable.<eos> Mercy.<eos> I'm fresh out.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Go to sleep, darling.<eos> Just one question.<eos> Did Walter Sullivan say why Christy didn't go to Barbados?<eos> Just that she changed her mind.<eos> You know who did it, don't you?<eos> So will you.
Tell her to hold on.<eos> I will, brother.<eos> Be very careful, whatever you do.<eos> Tell her that I built the prettiest little church this side of heaven out in the wild wood.<eos> Tell her that.<eos> Tell her the bad boy done it again.<eos> I can't make it.<eos> I'm going to try, but tell her to hold on.<eos> OK, Sonny.<eos> I will.
I saw you by the river.<eos> You were making a fool of yourself... and I said, "Some day I'll be at Dachau with that man, moving rocks."<eos> I didn't like Berlin.<eos> I mean, I wasn't happy.<eos> But I like it now.<eos> I miss it.<eos> We'll go back someday.<eos> - When we get out of here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We will, won't we?
Believe in yourself, my son.<eos> I know you will succeed.<eos> Thank you, sensei.<eos> There is no better father that a boy could have had.<eos> Go, Haru.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait up!<eos> Goodbye, everyone!<eos> I'm going to miss him.<eos> No, you will not.
What are you talkin' about?<eos> Why don't you ask Liam why he burned down the gym?<eos> I just follow orders.<eos> He's way out of control, Joe.<eos> Hello, Maggie.<eos> - It's your da.<eos> - All right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Sure you never will.
But I've had those experiences, on my own.<eos> And I can't accompany you on yours.<eos> I'm past that now.<eos> Or maybe I just love you too much.<eos> And I feel hurt and let down that you would want to share me with anyone.<eos> Because I would never want to share you.<eos> Regardless, I can't be a part of this.<eos> Or you. Not anymore.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
If Howard had won, then all the investors would sue, and that could have cost Calvert tens of millions.<eos> Did you ever meet this guy?<eos> Once, at a deposition.<eos> He had the nerve to hit on me - at a deposition!<eos> Well, that's terrible.<eos> - He's a married man!<eos> That doesn't say a lot for his character.<eos> Thank you very much, Miss Rose. I appreciate the time.<eos> I hope you find Howard's killer.<eos> I will, Miss Rose.

Connecticut.<eos> We shut the bridge down. All off-ramps.<eos> Both levels. Got it?<eos> Roger that.<eos> I'll take the west end.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> You hear it?<eos> The music, I almost hear it.<eos> I almost hear it.<eos> We will.

You work for me, Randolph.<eos> You understand that?<eos> I guess you'll have to fire me.<eos> What if I were to order you to ready this boat for immediate departure?<eos> It means you lose your job.<eos> They told me to keep an eye on you.<eos> That is exactly what I'm going to do.<eos> Stevens, where did you put the boat?<eos> - I don't hear anything.<eos> - The whales will.
- They're too busy thinking about themselves.<eos> A greasy pole.<eos> - No loyalty.<eos> - No, um,<eos> Iove.<eos> I promised to protect her...<eos> from people like you.<eos> [Chuckling] For once in my life, I'm not the issue.<eos> - She'll never understand it.<eos> - Oh, in time she will.
He'd be right!<eos> Because by all the evidence, Jim Williams is an innocent man.<eos> But I'm not Perry Mason.<eos> I'm not some TV lawyer.<eos> So I got to scratch and tear at the prosecution's case trying to whittle it down to nothing.<eos> And darned if I don't think I have!<eos> Because the fabrication of the prosecution's case is in pieces.<eos> When you consider how Detective Boone has consistently lied about bagging the hands.<eos> Does that surprise you that a detective would lie?<eos> Of course he will.
I can take you over to my grandmama house. She cook you some chicken, some cornbread, some poulet.<eos> It's cold.<eos> It's colder than a motherfucker.<eos> A serious crime.<eos> Justified punishment.<eos> This is James Russell reporting.<eos> That's some hard-hitting stuff.<eos> John Tesh school of journalism.<eos> Barclay, just watch it one more time before you decide.<eos> Why? Nobody else will.
You fucking wanker!<eos> Do you want it, you cunt?<eos> - Do you want it with me?<eos> - Fucking hell.<eos> Fucking hell.<eos> Lovely.<eos> - Two shots.<eos> - Two shots.<eos> - Finish the game up here, watch.<eos> - You won't.
I'm working like crazy...<eos> Yes, it's the big day soon.<eos> When is it exactly?<eos> Friday at three. In three days time.<eos> You're not too anxious?<eos> I feel unbelievably relaxed.<eos> It's my sister who's all worked up.<eos> And my father's making a six-hour train journey to hear a thesis on yeomen in the year 1000 at Paladru Lake.<eos> He'll nod off after five minutes.<eos> Everyone else probably will too.
So...<eos> - But how can I bless you, son?<eos> - Why not?<eos> They are Nitin, Sonali, Daksha, Dabboo...<eos> That N.R.l. is being fussed over as though he's God!<eos> That Surajdev has an complex about foreign countries!<eos> - I know him for 1O years!<eos> - You are an N.R.l. too.<eos> - Why don't they fuss over you?<eos> - They will, my dear.
Ls it true... that you've asked your friend's daughter's hand in marriage?<eos> - Yes. And I've also given him my word.<eos> Good.<eos> But Kishorilal... do you know this too, that you're trying to bring... India's pure Ganges to these concrete jungles of America?<eos> I know it.<eos> But how about our future generation?<eos> Our Indian culture?<eos> Who will preserve it for us?<eos> - Rajiv will never agree to it.<eos> - He'll never.
A son of a wealthy man.<eos> A son... yes!<eos> But not an Indian.<eos> And the truth is, I always lied to Ganga.<eos> What is your relationship with Ganga?<eos> - Trust. Respect, reverence, and... Love.<eos> If protecting her, adds up to love, then, yes!<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> I love her.<eos> And I always will.
One dollar.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Wright.<eos> You better stop drinking, Lemuel, before I own... your house.<eos> Free of charge.<eos> Go see after your father.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Wright.<eos> Future customer.<eos> Sorry, I don't extend credit to strangers.<eos> You own that plot of land across the way?<eos> I will... this time tomorrow.
Why not?<eos> Right, time is short we can start bombing tomorrow<eos> But the Generalissimo is in Xian<eos> Officer Ho<eos> Lucky you are here to lead those idiots<eos> If you're someone else I'd have thought you a traitor And have you shot<eos> I don't get it<eos> Under the pretext of saving the Generalissimo someone may want to seize power<eos> But you, of course, you won't<eos> Of course, I won't but
It's a cruise.<eos> This is so unfair, Alex.<eos> You can't pull out tickets to some exotic island and think that'll make everything OK.<eos> I don't expect that I can make it all right, but, maybe I thought we could.<eos> No. Don't do that.<eos> I wanna be depressed.<eos> I don't want you to do that.<eos> Don't!<eos> - Don't.<eos> - I won't.
Well, maybe.<eos> You don't have to be jealous.<eos> Break it up, you two.<eos> There's a place for that sort of thing.<eos> I've been thinking, and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.<eos> I'm gonna go for Federal Service.<eos> That's great!<eos> Carl and I are signing up tomorrow.<eos> Come with us.<eos> I will.
Oh, it's exciting going away. But I'm scared. Aren't you?<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> I'm gonna miss you too.<eos> I love you.<eos> Outbound group 94-A, Tereshkova, all sections... That's me.<eos> Just say it once.<eos> Try it on for size.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Don't forget to write.<eos> - I won't.
There is no one to hear you, no hope of rescue, no possibility of escape.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Absolute devotion and the pleasure of your music.<eos> In return, I offer you the secret sought by man since the dawn of time... eternal life.<eos> No.<eos> Let me go home now.<eos> Embrace me willingly, and your passage will be painless.<eos> Resist me, and you will agonize 'til the end of time.<eos> I shall drink from you slowly until you embrace me as your master.<eos> Like hell you will!
I know, I know.<eos> - When are you going?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> How long will you be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have to find your mother.<eos> I have to get her to sign some papers.<eos> Then we can adopt you.<eos> What if she says no?<eos> She won't.
I'm sure we can find an hotel near here.<eos> Somewhere where you can work.<eos> - I've decided to see him again, Robbie.<eos> - I thought you might.<eos> - I've nothing left.<eos> I've lost my wife.<eos> I've lost my children.<eos> They won't allow me to see them now.<eos> No one will ever read my plays or books again.<eos> Yes, they will.
- You know me, huh?<eos> You cesspool.<eos> Stop it, please.<eos> Come on, let's go inside!<eos> Let's go inside, it's pointless.<eos> - Watch your step!<eos> - Let him go.<eos> - I'll beat you up, you little shit!<eos> - You come here early morning tomorrow, will you?<eos> - Of course we will, Irén.
I'm sorry, I cannot get up and welcome you. I mean...<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong? I'm naked.<eos> Have you worn anything?<eos> That's okay.<eos> No problem, we'll meet later...<eos> Let's go?<eos> I have some urgent work with you.<eos> Come immediately.<eos> Yes, I will.
I don't believe in God.<eos> How do you explain what happened?<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> - Your face.<eos> - There is no explanation.<eos> - I believe there is.<eos> - You believe I'm mad.<eos> - I only believe what I see.<eos> You haven't let me see your face yet.<eos> And I won't.
A pity you didn't see my face, bitch!<eos> - Why do this?<eos> How have I changed?<eos> - You haven't. You're the same lunatic who gate-crashed my party.<eos> I'm the girl you made love to just now.<eos> I'm Eofia.<eos> Etop saying you're Eofia, do you hear?<eos> Don't say her name!<eos> You won't tell me where she is.<eos> You never will.
It's my birthday.<eos> You're going to leave me alone?<eos> Then, do you want to go on a picnic this weekend?<eos> You can go alone.<eos> I won't go.<eos> Do as you want.<eos> I'm leaving and you live here forever.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Will you promise to go on a picnic with me this weekend?<eos> I will.
I see.<eos> Shigure told me that the Bakumatsu was incredibly chaotic.<eos> Nobody could tell good from evil.<eos> He said that people fought solely for what was in their hearts.<eos> I believe what he said.<eos> I am going to travel to Shigure's hometown to bury his belongings.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Take care, Ms. Toki.<eos> I hope you come back soon.<eos> I will.
Take care, Ms. Toki.<eos> I hope you come back soon.<eos> I will.<eos> The children will be waiting.<eos> At your private school?<eos> Yes, and someday I want to teach this story to my students.<eos> They should know how people felt during the Bakumatsu.<eos> They might grow up to create the world Shigure dreamed of.<eos> One in which no blood is shed. I hope you'll visit his grave soon.<eos> I most definitely will.
for your insolence I shall have my revenge!<eos> And how, and how, how, pray?<eos> I am going, sweetheart, to play you forthwith a work of genius, my latest concerto!<eos> Mercy, mercy, I beg you!<eos> -No, no, it cannot wait, it is the pinnacle of my art, it lasts an hour and a quarter!<eos> For heaven's sake, an hour and a quarter!<eos> -An hour and a quarter! It's the pinnacle of my art!<eos> -I shan't listen. -Oh yes you will.<eos> I shan't listen.<eos> -Oh yes you will!
First, if you cooperate we provide fighter escorts to protect your ships as far away as four jumps.<eos> That should cut down on your risk factor.<eos> Second, as long as you're operating on our behalf we will take care of your ships.<eos> We've got the best mechanics in the Sector.<eos> Maintenance, fuel, you name it.<eos> No cost.<eos> We'll upgrade your data systems and supercharge your engines and if you have an accident, we'll repair your ships.<eos> And sooner or later, your ships will have accidents.<eos> - My pilots don't have accidents.<eos> - They will.
- Hey, Henry!<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> - John, I didn't get you anything.<eos> It's your evaluation.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> You just passed Emergency Medicine.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Do me a favor? Stick to brain research.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will.
So why don't you stay here for a while?<eos> I'll go back up to Barstow, and you spend some time with him.<eos> Why bother?<eos> You didn't miss much, not having your father around when you were growing up.<eos> Believe me.<eos> That's kind of a crappy thing to say, isn't it?<eos> It wasn't my idea to come down here.<eos> Don't stay.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
Listen I thought about what we talked about and I don't have any more claim on his name than you do.<eos> I'd be happy with "Reece. "<eos> I would.<eos> Well, I thought about it too, Peter.<eos> And I'd be okay with Benton.<eos> So why don't we name him Reece Benton?<eos> Reece Benton.<eos> Sounds a little formal but we'll get used to it.<eos> Reece Benton.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we will.
... andthenthewhole punctured-lung thing.<eos> It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...<eos> ... butwithAlice, all that stuff kind of went away.<eos> And now it's gone, and I don't know why.<eos> Well, I can tell you why.<eos> It's because of me.<eos> But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?<eos> I kind of had a little chat with Alice... ... andI sortof madeher see why you two shouldn't be together.<eos> And you'll see it too, one day.<eos> You really, really will.
Okay, back up.<eos> You lost me.<eos> Well, if Hasan was spying and Beth found out about it, gives him a motive to kill her, correct?<eos> Yeah, assuming she found something incriminating, which she didn't.<eos> Maybe she found something without realising it.<eos> Maybe something in the computers.<eos> So assuming he was a spy and assuming he thought she'd found out,<eos> Colonel Hasan was going to kill her just to be safe?<eos> You're not buying it?<eos> No, and nobody else will either.
Wait a minute. Wait a sec!<eos> Wait a minute! Wait a second! Wait a second!<eos> Did she ask for me?<eos> She was in shock. She couldn't talk.<eos> Was she in pain?<eos> She's gone, Phil.<eos> She was my wife.<eos> And I've got a right to know how she died.<eos> She died alone.<eos> Just like you and I will.
You have no idea.<eos> And it must be even more difficult knowing that the bomb was meant for you.<eos> You said that you don't believe in ghosts.<eos> Well, I don't either.<eos> But Jack Holford is out there, alive.<eos> And he's after you. I'm sure of it.<eos> Why?<eos> You tell me.<eos> He's one of your boys.<eos> Okay. I will.
My dad was MIA.<eos> We lost the cell phone connection, sir.<eos> Maybe his battery went dead.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> Major, your friend can't wing it alone in there.<eos> I need as much information on this as I can get.<eos> Look, there's no pressure.<eos> They're not gonna just storm in here, so take your time.<eos> - We'll go out when you're ready.<eos> We won't.
This is the Endorph-A sand.<eos> We refined these crystals, and made the medicine.<eos> The other researchers said it was... either a fungus or some sort of moss.<eos> But I knew otherwise.<eos> It was not from here.<eos> It was brought here on the wind.<eos> You mean a pollen or a spore?<eos> There's a field of flowers up ahead somewhere.<eos> The wind rolls through here, so we haven't found it.<eos> But one day I will.
Why just a watch?<eos> Why not wade into them and start breaking heads?<eos> - That's what we should be talking about!<eos> - Keep your voice down.<eos> You can't just wade into them.<eos> There's too many of them.<eos> We'll get every man here.<eos> Should have done it two months ago.<eos> It's just that everyone thought we was gonna be exchanged.<eos> Sure we will.
It's a quite extraordinary story.<eos> He insists he was a prisoner in a land of giants.<eos> he was the giant.<eos> And you just found him wandering about the streets?<eos> The lady brought him to my surgery.<eos> What is the patient's name?<eos> Just put 'Patient of Doctor Bates'.<eos> Don't you want to see the harvest parade?<eos> The noise will give me a headache.<eos> will you?
"lt can even make a contaminant-free fuel.<eos> "But the greatest value to us Bio-Domers...<eos> "is its rapid rate of photosynensisis...<eos> "which means more oxygen for everyone."<eos> On three.<eos> Three!<eos> Cannonball!<eos> There you go, Mr. Bloom.<eos> Now, tell Bud and Doyle... I'm writing a song about them, OK?<eos> OK, we will.
Best job I ever had-- working my way up, meeting people... listening to stories.<eos> One day he walks over and says, "Dignan, you're out," just like that.<eos> By the way, man, he was right.<eos> Just because it's a front doesn't mean somebody doesn't have to do landscaping.<eos> But those days are over now.<eos> Just a matter of time before I pick up the phone and say...<eos> "Mr. H., we are coming home."<eos> So don't worry about your future, man, because I am thinking.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention... to Bob about me getting fired.<eos> I won't.
Don't worry.<eos> When can we go?<eos> - When can we go?<eos> - Yes, when?<eos> In three days. At dawn.<eos> I was told it'd be tomorrow.<eos> I've been told lots of things.<eos> This won't work.<eos> He won't come.<eos> Yes, he will.
What do you make of this?<eos> God help me, I cannot say but I'm sure the child must be heard, Thomas or it will surely spread that you've silenced her.<eos> Is this the man whose wife is pregnant?<eos> Aye, she's the one.<eos> Your wife has sent me a claim that she is pregnant now.<eos> There be no sign of it.<eos> We have examined her body.<eos> But if she says she is pregnant, she must be.<eos> That woman will never lie, Mr. Danforth.<eos> - She will not?
A home? No.<eos> It's better this way.<eos> Why are you in Istanbul uncle?<eos> I am looking for somebody.<eos> Where is that somebody?<eos> I don't know...<eos> What do you mean "I don't know"?<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> How are you going to find him in this huge city?<eos> I will.
We'll be over.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going back to the neighbourhood<eos> I have to take care of some business.<eos> I will see you there.<eos> Don't get lost, okay?<eos> We have to leave the city. There's this lad who helped me a lot.<eos> He is in trouble. I must help him.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> I will.
-We heard some shots.<eos> -lt was only us.<eos> We were calibrating the sight.<eos> -And looking out for poachers.<eos> -There are lots of elk here. -We want to hunt them this autumn.<eos> -Keep us informed.<eos> Bloody idiot!<eos> -Let us know if you see anything.<eos> -Say hello to Karin.<eos> -l will.
Just like DiMaggio is to baseball... or "Unitas" is to football.<eos> That's what "Munson" will be to bowling.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah, Roy.<eos> I hope so, Dad.<eos> I want to make you proud.<eos> Maybe you can get this old piece of crap working... of if you get in a pinch, maybe you'll get a couple of bucks for it.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> - You go get 'em, son.<eos> - I will.
I just wanted to...<eos> Detective Macaroni, smoking is not permitted in here.<eos> If you do not put it out immediately, I shall get very unpleasant.<eos> And that's a pill-box, not an ashtray.<eos> Take the blue ones this evening and the red ones in the morning.<eos> You've passed water. That's a good sign.<eos> It means you're over the worst.<eos> - Thanks, Dr Riffleson.<eos> That's what I'm here for.<eos> No, I won't!
- You'll have to ask your mother about that.<eos> - She's allergic.<eos> Oh, that's right. She gets all...<eos> All right. You know what?<eos> Bob can just stay at my house.<eos> Where would he sleep?<eos> You know that room with all the boxes in it? We could clear it out. He could sleep there.<eos> - That's a good idea. - Yeah.<eos> Of course you're gonna have to come over and visit every once in a while to check up. Make sure I'm feedin' him and everything.<eos> - I will.
But, I'm not gonna think that though.<eos> ( Susie ) Think good thoughts, while I'm on the phone.<eos> Talk about something good while I'm on the phone.<eos> Hey, you're supposed to be talking to me, not your friends.<eos> These people make me mad.<eos> You know it ?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They get to go out and screw people and I can't.<eos> That's what y'all do, I can't do that.<eos> Well, you will later. I will later ?
- Give him one now.<eos> Just give him one...<eos> - He gets shit until it's done.<eos> It's 3:45, we gotta go.<eos> Come on, Paki-lover.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> I'll tell Milo about it.<eos> Make sure you have the money tomorrow.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
I didn't have my mother.<eos> I believed blindly everything you said... ..because you related to me as a mother.<eos> A mother's status is the most significant one.<eos> Never fool around with your progeny in your<eos> Otherwise nobody will trust one's mother henceforth.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> All is not lost yet.<eos> Tomorrow morning, Raja will come straight home with the child.<eos> We'll reunite you with him there.<eos> Won't we?
But it generates disorder.<eos> Its laws obey chance, so it makes lots of mistakes.<eos> And it's a machine that makes noise although you don't hear mental noise.<eos> Like cosmic dust, which I've never seen.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Does anyone want to take me?<eos> Not me, blondie.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
Picking up speed.<eos> Sometime this week would be good.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> You mad?<eos> I will be later. Now I'm trying not to kill us.<eos> Funnel's getting thicker!<eos> It's moving fast! Coming towards you!<eos> It's turning!<eos> -I can't see it.<eos> -You will!
- You want me to do it?<eos> - I want $10,000 to keep quiet.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Bullshit! Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> I will go to Niagara Falls and tell him.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> - Ten thousand dollars.<eos> - I'II get it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Don't you think that I want to tear this station apart looking for her?<eos> She is my mentor, my teacher, my--<eos> As part of the rebirth ceremony I am required to tell someone that which I have never told anyone before.<eos> This is as good a time as any.<eos> I love her.<eos> You'll forgive me if I'm a little surprised at your admission.<eos> My love for Delenn is not quite what you might think.<eos> It is not romantic love as you consider it.<eos> It is something higher and nobler.<eos> A purer, perfect love, if you will.
I understand you.<eos> You will remain here until we are finished.<eos> When we turn up missing, people will come looking for us.<eos> Now, you cooperate, we can try to work this out.<eos> If not, I can't guarantee the safety of you or any of your people.<eos> And I cannot guarantee yours.<eos> That went well.<eos> At least I'm trying something.<eos> We gotta get out and tell the others what's happening.<eos> - We will. - How?
You have already wasted two others.<eos> You must save the eye that does not see.<eos> You must not kill the one who is already dead.<eos> And at the last... you must surrender yourself to your greatest fear... knowing that it will destroy you.<eos> Now, if you have failed all the others, that is your final chance for redemption.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The future reveals itself only reluctantly, ambassador.<eos> Take the sign for what it is.<eos> Look for it when it appears.<eos> I will.
Like "That would be an ecumenical matter."<eos> Yes, any religious question can be answered by that.<eos> That's what I always say.<eos> That's the great thing about Catholicism.<eos> It's so vague, nobody knows what it's all about.<eos> I think it might work, Dougal.<eos> I know it'll work.<eos> It WILL work!<eos> It won't work, will it, Ted?<eos> It won't, no.
- I'm sure it was just a cat.<eos> - It's nothing, honey.<eos> Just an adjustment.<eos> You guys all locked up?<eos> We're fine, Frank, really.<eos> It's a perfectly safe neighbourhood.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> Want me to call you back?<eos> - Did you catch the bad man, Frank?<eos> - No. But we will.
That's why when you persisted I tried to contact you at the newspaper.<eos> In another two weeks, you'll suffer the same fate as the others.<eos> That can't be.<eos> You must understand the risk you represent... ..to your entire race.<eos> So that's it...<eos> It'sover?<eos> You still have some time left if you care to make use of it.<eos> You won't be contagious for another two weeks.<eos> - What if I run?<eos> - You won't.
-We've gotta find that kid. -Yes, sir. -We must find George.<eos> -Find him, Wilhelm. -Yes, sir.<eos> Excuse me. Do you know the gentleman across the hall?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> Do you know if he'll be back anytime soon?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?<eos> No, I really just needed to speak with him.<eos> Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.<eos> Well, maybe I will.
Are my parents safe?<eos> - Are they?<eos> - I cannot say.<eos> Richard swore to protect them.<eos> If harm comes to my parents, it falls on me that I gave in to selfish passion.<eos> That choice cannot be taken back.<eos> But things may yet be right.<eos> As you love Richard, trust in him.<eos> Ride to Hampstead and await better news.<eos> I will away.
The way everyone looks at me... I can't stand it.<eos> After the court-martial's over, I'm definitely signing up for the next mining expedition to the Gamma Quadrant.<eos> Maybe there won't be a court-martial.<eos> You're right.<eos> None of us may get out of here alive.<eos> No, I mean Starfleet could decide to send you to counseling instead.<eos> I won't go.<eos> I don't deserve to be in Starfleet.<eos> Therapy won't change what I did.<eos> Nothing will.
I say we take some floaters up into the hills and go skinny-dipping in the hot springs.<eos> I never thought I'd say this but I'm with Quark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Great. Just what we needed.<eos> I thought it wasn't supposed to rain in this part of Risa.<eos> It's not.<eos> Something must be wrong with the weather grid.<eos> May I have your attention, please.<eos> Obviously, the weather grid is experiencing some type of malfunction but I'm sure we'll be able to repair it soon.<eos> No... you won't.
What link did this dead deputy have with him?<eos> None, as far as I can tell.<eos> Kerber was a good cop.<eos> Then why did he free him?<eos> Pusher kept rambling about cerulean blue, kept saying how it reminded him of a breeze or somethin'.<eos> "Cerulean blue is like a gentle breeze."<eos> Over and over.<eos> And then Kerber pulled into the truck and... blammo.<eos> So you think Pusher somehow talked him into doing this, willed him into doing that?<eos> Willed him?
Let's not start on that again, OK?<eos> You turn around?<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> Let's put the knives in your father's back where they belong.<eos> Yeah, that might be more appropriate.<eos> I can't help wishing you had inherited... a little bit of his promiscuity.<eos> But look where it got him.<eos> I wish I'd seen him at least once before he died.<eos> He was alone, and I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> It won't.
If you love me like you say you do...<eos> - I do.<eos> - Then why?<eos> You like a town?<eos> A ranch ain't lively enough for you? Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't build that ranch out there out of nothing just to live out there by myself with no wife and and no children.<eos> I apologise, Dora.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
What can we do?<eos> We've done everything we could.<eos> Obviously, we didn't.<eos> People are still dying!<eos> How many more are we going to bury?<eos> If I can just find my father, all the problems will be solved.<eos> Our people will stop dying.<eos> We'll help find your father.<eos> -You will?<eos> -Yeah, we will.
I know her pretty well.<eos> She's had a Iot of success getting congressmen elected.<eos> Maybe we should try to steal her.<eos> Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that.<eos> If you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello.<eos> - It might smooth the way.<eos> - Mention it to Janie tomorrow.<eos> - Good deal. - And let's focus on the crime bill.<eos> I don't want to just win this one. I want to win by a couple of touchdowns.<eos> We will, Mr. President.
Luther.<eos> Luther.<eos> Where is this guy?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> - If.<eos> You nervous.<eos> - No, Dad.<eos> If you lie, your nose will grow.<eos> - It will not.
Is there something you want to say, Colonel?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - You handled that quite deftly.<eos> - Bondarchuk is a stupid man.<eos> He may be stupid, but he is in charge.<eos> How can it be that you don't seem to know how things work in the Soviet system?<eos> I know how things work, but right now there are 16 dead children and I want a little special treatment.<eos> The strength of a bureaucracy is measured by its ability to resist giving anyone special treatment.<eos> I don't appreciate your sense of humor.<eos> One day you will.
- And may I speak with him?<eos> - Is the ebony Samaritan there now?<eos> - You got a problem with ebony?<eos> No, no. My only problem is that I went to some trouble preparing that game for McClane.<eos> You interfered with a well-laid plan. Yeah?<eos> Well, you can stick your well-laid plan up your well-laid ass. That was not smart.<eos> There are lives at stake here.<eos> - Not enough time, Inspector.<eos> - You'd better hope he calls back.<eos> He will.
Well, yes.<eos> -Are you alone?<eos> -No way! Madam is asleep, nothing will waken her.<eos> So I have to prepare everything.<eos> -ls there a celebration?<eos> -Christmas Eve.<eos> Of course, Christmas Eve!<eos> What was I thinking of?<eos> -Won't you have something?<eos> -No, I won't.
What did you expect?<eos> Are you convinced?<eos> -Nothing's happening. -Of course not.<eos> This is just messing around.<eos> I told you.<eos> The Devil!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Will we try the music?<eos> No, we won't.
- When Music Town comes in...<eos> Joe is out. A.J. Is out.<eos> All the beautiful little tattooed, gum-chewing freaks are out as well.<eos> And it pretty much goes without saying, that I'm out.<eos> Wish it had gone without saying, but you won't shut up.<eos> What I think Lucas is trying to say is that I'm going to open my own store.<eos> You don't have the start-up capital.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> But I will.
-We haven't broken the back of it.<eos> Yes, we have.<eos> We're almost up to 14 feet.<eos> We'll need more as we get higher and the base grows wider.<eos> He's right.<eos> Pessimists, all of you.<eos> And you!<eos> You!<eos> You said it would rain.<eos> -And it will. God, dear.
- I'm so glad I made it.<eos> - Me too!<eos> DR. WAGNER: Slow down, kids.<eos> Dad, if...<eos> - Just go.<eos> I don't see enough of an improvement.<eos> Let's get you delivered.<eos> - Pat, we're on our way.<eos> What if she doesn't get the baby out in time?<eos> - She will. - NURSE:
my dear Mr. Williams.<eos> Peppermint?<eos> Information is power.<eos> one cannot seize power.<eos> You need to think about becoming mentally competitive.<eos> Being black does not free you from being a responsible individual.<eos> But being a responsible individual don't free you from being black.<eos> misguided soul.<eos> You have yet to learn the rules of this game.<eos> - He will.
I'M SLEEPING HERE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE COUCH.<eos> I'M SLEEPING HERE.<eos> SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?<eos> DID LEO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BAD LUNCH MEETING WE'VE GOT IN SALISBURY TOMORROW?<eos> NO, I--I DIDN'T...<eos> GET A CHANCE... IT'S EARLY.<eos> I FIGURE WE HAVE TO LEAVE BEFORE DAWN, SO...<eos> I'M GOING TO MAKE MYSELF SCARCE. NO.<eos> YOU KNOW WHAT?<eos> I WILL.
- Who?<eos> - Cox. Archibald Cox.<eos> Fire him!<eos> - He works for the attorney general.<eos> - Only Richardson can fire him.<eos> - May I echo my concern, sir?<eos> - Then tell Richardson to fire him!<eos> - Well, Richardson won't do that, sir.<eos> - He'll resign.<eos> - The hell he will.
What revolts other people is inviting to you.<eos> She is a former school fellow, and I am spending this afternoon with her.<eos> Lady Dalrymple's invitation is most pressing.<eos> Could you not put her off till tomorrow?<eos> It is the only afternoon which suits both her and myself.<eos> So, you would snub Lady Dalrymple for a Mrs Smith, lodging in Westgate Buildings.<eos> That you'd prefer an everyday Mrs Smith to your family connections among the nobility?<eos> Mrs Smith - such a name!<eos> Once and for all, will you accompany us to a tea party at the Dalrymples?<eos> No, sir. I will not!
An acquaintance.<eos> His sister's married to a tenant of mine.<eos> Do you take my meaning, Anne, or must I translate for you?<eos> please excuse me one moment.<eos> Oh, Captain.<eos> Are you leaving already?<eos> yes.<eos> But the music is good, is it not?<eos> I neither know nor care.<eos> - But will you not...
- My compass. - Compass?<eos> It tells you how to find your way when you get lost.<eos> It's all right. I'll get another in London.<eos> London?<eos> Is that your village?<eos> - Yes. It's a very big village.<eos> - What's it like?<eos> It's got streets filled with carriages, bridges over the rivers, and buildings as tall as trees.<eos> - I'd like to see those things.<eos> - You will. - How?
Give a call over there, will you, Maxine?<eos> Listen, this is like having your heart torn out every day.<eos> Doug, there's no explanation why your wife should still be alive right now.<eos> [ Doug ] Give me the short one, will you, Doc?<eos> She can't like seeing this strain on you, which may be why she's hanging on through the worst pain of her life.<eos> It's just gonna make it that much easier if we get her back to County.<eos> This is where she wants to be, Duane.<eos> She told me when she still could.<eos> She keeps holding on.<eos> And you won't.
Mary, are you hurt?<eos> Did they wound you?<eos> Mary.<eos> What have they done?<eos> We will avenge you.<eos> Rob will kill every last one of them.<eos> He will not know.<eos> Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not!
Mary.<eos> What have they done?<eos> We will avenge you.<eos> Rob will kill every last one of them.<eos> He will not know.<eos> Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not!<eos> He will not know!<eos> He will not!
Could the freak be more vague?<eos> As far as master plans go...<eos> I really can't wait for you to see.<eos> It's going to be something.<eos> Know what?<eos> I'll be standing next to you.<eos> So when this thing happens, be sure and let me know.<eos> Don't want to miss it.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> You won't.
Say it again !<eos> Didn't hear you !<eos> -You understood, you're " different " !<eos> Come on guys , we're not going to fight!<eos> Listen, personally, I swear I don't care if you're black .<eos> I have friends that are blacker than you!<eos> -it's fine ! I drive alone, life continues, no problem !<eos> Well go continue your life !<eos> Continue it !<eos> And I will !
You know if the child wasn't here How much you bet I would of jumped !<eos> Say it Again !<eos> And maybe what I need is a "communication" dude !<eos> ...with their faget pony tails !<eos> Come again !<eos> You don't like that ?<eos> Faget !<eos> Say that again !<eos> Go ahead !<eos> Non I won't !
-All right, take five everyone!<eos> -I'll be back in a second.<eos> -What were you doing at the school?<eos> Are you stalking me or something?<eos> -I'm sorry if I threw you by showing up. I mean, to interrupt you and your man.<eos> -That's what I came to talk to you about.<eos> Petra, uh... What happened this morning... was an aberration.<eos> -Of course.<eos> -So, don't think that I'm a...<eos> -Oh, I won't, I won't.
I've been there... out on that third mesa.<eos> There in the middle of the Arizona desert is a simple, primitive people... that has kept its culture intact.<eos> I got this belt buckle for a song.<eos> That's really something.<eos> So, you're gonna accept my thesis?<eos> Well, now...<eos> Walk with me.<eos> Dennis, I like you, and I am positively wild about your work.<eos> I know you're about to graduate, but I'd like you to stay on... and act as my assistant next year...<eos> my understudy, if you will.
- You counted them?<eos> - I have.<eos> - Every one?<eos> - Every one.<eos> Dried lamb, bread, dates, and the water.<eos> - Is that enough for you?<eos> - It's two or three days.<eos> I'll see them settled for summer grazing, then I'll return.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - I will.
I have spoken.<eos> Here you are, go on.<eos> This is our day of freedom!<eos> Praise be to God, Zerack.<eos> We are leaving.<eos> Ready?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Truly, Moses, you are a prophet of God!<eos> I never thought to see the day we would be gone from Egypt.<eos> - You will.
Really.<eos> Of course not.<eos> And we'll pay him back.<eos> Sure we will.<eos> Hey, we'll pay everybody back.<eos> - You won't tell anyone, right?<eos> - No. Oh, no, of course not.<eos> - You'll tell.<eos> - No, Warren.<eos> I won't, really.
Ted, could you tell me where the old...<eos> You know, the old...<eos> The old... is up the stairs and first on the left.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a wig. (Bell) Time for a little nightcap.<eos> You're running out of sandwiches.<eos> I'll bring you in some more.<eos> I won't have a sherry, thank you.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> Of course you will. –No.
And that scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do!<eos> Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.<eos> We didn't get into Scranton.<eos> That was our safety zoo.<eos> They take, like, dogs and cows.<eos> I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.<eos> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.<eos> Good boy!<eos> See? How can nobody want him?<eos> Somebody will.
I take a sip, the caffeine kicks in.<eos> My brain starts to order the day.<eos> I'm up.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> I'm ready to rock.<eos> So you wouldn't suspect the neighbour?<eos> Time is coming when I'm not getting out of bed.<eos> I'm not getting up for coffee or food or sex.<eos> If it comes to me, fine.<eos> If it won't, fine.
Detective, you acknowledge being given your rights?<eos> Yes.<eos> Detective Kowalski, do you know a Jimmy Fredo... a Tom Rotella or a Brendan Bickles?<eos> I decline to answer that... as is my right under the Fifth Amendment.<eos> Your name has come up in connection with an armored car robbery... that took place September 9, 1992.<eos> - What was your involvement in that incident?<eos> - I decline to answer. And accomplish what?<eos> You decline an answer if you know guys that we know you know?<eos> - What, you think I'm an asshole? - That one I'll answer.<eos> No, you won't.
Approach to gender in the work combines the kind to look behind the curtain.<eos> You simply watch the magic trick, not seek to know how it works.<eos> Then, take acting classes better lie!<eos> I spoke to Dr. Bellamy.<eos> He called my friends ...<eos> Ah, I see ...<eos> You trust to medicine.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> When will my friends ...
I'm gonna go down to the precinct, have lunch with Lou.<eos> Oh, I'll split a cab with you.<eos> Hey, I'm really sorry about the other day, man.<eos> Really sorry.<eos> Hey, that's my coffee.<eos> - Hi, sarge. - Hi.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Some of our lineup decoys didn't show, so...<eos> Hey, any of you guys want to be in the lineup, make a quick 50 bucks?<eos> Sure, I will.

I don't care what you think.<eos> This is our one chance to get out of here and we've got to take it.<eos> And it's also our one chance to break their addiction.<eos> Julian, even if you find a cure they're going to kill you anyway.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Goran'Agar-- Forget about him. What about all the others?<eos> They're still a bunch of bloodthirsty-- Look, we haven't got enough time to argue about this.<eos> If you want to go, go.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Remind him where he belongs.<eos> - What about Sisko?<eos> - Take me to the lntendant's quarters.<eos> She'll decide what to do with me.<eos> - Of all the impudent...<eos> - Do as he says.<eos> Intendant, I demand that this man be...<eos> You... demand?<eos> You promised me he'd die.<eos> And he will...
This is such a generous, selfless act.<eos> It's my last gift for you and the children.<eos> And it's one we will always cherish.<eos> - But I'm still gonna miss you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'll miss you too.<eos> But I'll see you in the Next Emanation when you're ready to join me.<eos> Give my love to your father.<eos> Tell him that the garili trees he planted have bloomed for three years straight.<eos> I will.
They're a remarkably pleasure-orientated people.<eos> They may appreciate a gift of literature.<eos> I'll meet with Gath. As magistrate he has authority to make this decision.<eos> I'll take a look at that trajector platform. Maybe I can figure out how it works.<eos> You'll do nothing of the sort, Lieutenant.<eos> If this law is negotiable, I'll make every attempt to get the technology.<eos> Until then, we won't do anything to violate their canon of laws... as we understand it. That's all.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just hope she gets it.<eos> She will.
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.<eos> I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.<eos> And...there was more.<eos> There was something about a friend... I...<eos> Why can't I remember?<eos> I wanted to tell her!<eos> Is all right.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Yes, yes, you're right.<eos> She will.
But God will find someone to stop it.<eos> Someone who is strong enough to make the sacrifice.<eos> He's chosen you?<eos> I'm merely a messenger.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You must come full circle to find the truth.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Full circle to find the truth?<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You will.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Look, I'm gonna ride up ahead and see if we can ford the Meleatus River.<eos> Otherwise, we'll have to double back two days.<eos> Let's find some place you can wait for me.<eos> -What's wrong with this place?<eos> -Hello, beautiful.<eos> Another place sounds good.<eos> Come on, blondie, tell me a story.<eos> -Don't forget about me.<eos> -I won't.
I managed to get some milk for this baby, and it wasn't easy.<eos> You know there's a reward out for us?<eos> The word has it, it's over a thousand dinars.<eos> I'm tempted to turn myself in.<eos> What's wrong with Pandora?<eos> She's been like that ever since the tavern.<eos> I think it's the first time she's been without that box.<eos> Pandora... Are you all right?<eos> I have to get it back.<eos> You will.
Hyperion, please!<eos> You!<eos> Xena!<eos> Now!<eos> No!<eos> Please, don't kill him!<eos> Here! It's the chant that will turn us back to stone!<eos> It has to be read by the same virgin who released us.<eos> It won't work now!<eos> Yes, it will!
Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Anyway, we all pitched in, and we got you this little going-away thing.<eos> This was the happiest time of my life.<eos> I'll never forget you guys.<eos> Especially you, Joey.<eos> - See you around, Mr. Homer.<eos> - Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California someday.<eos> Sure, we will, Mr. Homer.<eos> Sure, we will.
I MEAN, YOU, WORKING AS A SINGLE?<eos> LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO JERRY LEWIS AFTER HE SPLIT WITH DEAN.<eos> ALL THAT STUFF IN YOUR HAIR.<eos> POINT TAKEN.<eos> BUT FEAR NOT, I HAVE ANOTHER PLAN.<eos> PINKY, I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU SMART.<eos> I... I DON'T UNDERSTAND, BRAIN.<eos> EXACTLY.<eos> BUT YOU WILL, MY FRIEND...<eos> YOU WILL.
"And this man will die...<eos> "He will..."
Where are you going?<eos> Wait here, James.<eos> - Get back in the car.<eos> - Just go on without me.<eos> - Get back in the damn car-<eos> - Go on without me, I don't need you.<eos> I'd run you down if I was 10, 15, 20 years younger.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - I wish you'd die.<eos> I will, Stumpy.
323.<eos> Very good.<eos> A majority of 30.<eos> Rather good.<eos> A government majority of 30.<eos> Government? 30?<eos> You mean we haven't won?<eos> Well, we didn't expect to win outright, not the first vote.<eos> I thought they liked me.<eos> They will, sir, they will, in time.
Two days, 16,000.<eos> - In two weeks there would be...<eos> - More than 250 billion.<eos> You OK?<eos> I don't know why your father picked me.<eos> - I won't be able to find the answer.<eos> - Wait.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> You'll find something.<eos> No, Mary, you will.
- Leave me alone.<eos> You said enough!<eos> Ling, no!<eos> You will hurt the baby!<eos> - Then put me down!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Leave me alone, I said!<eos> - No!<eos> You have to stop this!<eos> - All right, all right, I will.
Then I finally got a break a couple of months ago.<eos> - I followed up on this.<eos> - How did you follow up?<eos> I got a copy of her will. She left everything to her sister. An old Italian lady named Lucia.<eos> Certain mementos, photographs, a photographic segment, documents, including this list of names.<eos> You should know this is in Tony Bonamico's handwriting.<eos> - Why is it torn?<eos> - Maybe it was an accident.<eos> But considering the way Bonamico cut the photo, I figure he ripped it deliberately, and somebody else has the other part of this list.<eos> And here, also part of Mary's will, a photographic segment.
Beautiful wedding gown getting married in a Bel-Air mansion.<eos> Do you know where my mama was married?<eos> No, where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was hoping you did.<eos> Jewel, believe me when I tell you, you and Jazz are made for each other.<eos> Listen, trust me, I've known Jazz a long time and you are the best thing to ever happen to him.<eos> Will, I'm scared.<eos> What if it doesn't work out?<eos> - It will.
No, where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was hoping you did.<eos> Jewel, believe me when I tell you, you and Jazz are made for each other.<eos> Listen, trust me, I've known Jazz a long time and you are the best thing to ever happen to him.<eos> Will, I'm scared.<eos> What if it doesn't work out?<eos> - It will.<eos> - But what if it doesn't?<eos> It will.

What's going on?<eos> Well, I was walking... .<eos> Now, here's the thing. Here's the reason I contacted you.<eos> ... IswearIheardhervoice coming from that apartment right there...<eos> ... theoneon thegroundfloor with the lights.<eos> -l know how this must sound. -Mr. Bucci.<eos> I'm asking you, please, detective, just do this for me.<eos> She wasn't there?<eos> Please don't tell my wife that I called you, okay?<eos> No, I won't.
-l'll work on the wife.<eos> Kelly will fill you in, but this was clean.<eos> Good. Let's prove it was.<eos> Give me a minute. I'll run it. -Yeah.<eos> Lieutenant wants you and Greg to go to Psych Services.<eos> -The shrink.<eos> -That's standard.<eos> You did what you had to.<eos> -l wish they'd find that gun.<eos> -They will.
- Where'd we get that?<eos> - Anonymous call.<eos> All it took was for me to go to the can.<eos> We got an address?<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Wanna sit on his house?<eos> I wanna sit on his house.<eos> lntelligence is coming for the Linardi stuff.<eos> Can you voucher that notebook?<eos> - I will.
No! Let's cut it off.<eos> You must have got hold of something. For the babies' sake. Please tell us.<eos> What good does telling you? If you can handle it you won't hire me.<eos> For the justice you should...<eos> To hell with justice!<eos> I almost got killed!<eos> You killed the child!<eos> Tell me what you know!<eos> You think I'll listen to you?<eos> You will!
- Do you want one?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Me and you?<eos> - Me and you.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm cranking these down.<eos> You marker out, we don't win.<eos> - What if I crash and burn?<eos> - You won't.
I will count three, if you don't go out, I will call the police.<eos> One...<eos> Two, three!<eos> General, Yu Ti Hung has applied for sick leave.<eos> He will come back to school.<eos> Cause all his friends are here.<eos> Now, I will take over this school.<eos> I want a student, called Yu Ti Hung only.<eos> But you have to co-operate with me.<eos> I won't.
It's not healthy to sit inside all day and not do anything.<eos> You've got to do something.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm, uh - I'm leaving.<eos> I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me.<eos> But I understand.<eos> You're right. It's all up to me.<eos> I don't have much money.<eos> I can send you what I owe you, all right?<eos> I will.
Are you OK? The kids.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> Right here, Hoss.<eos> Hello, Thad.<eos> How are you, old buddy?<eos> - You look a little peaky.<eos> - You don't look so hot yourself.<eos> Lf... I do what you want me to do you promise not to hurt them.<eos> If I do what you want will you leave them alone?<eos> I will.
I'm so very tired.<eos> What can I do, sir?<eos> General?<eos> We must look to our own deportment.<eos> The spirit of the army is still very good.<eos> We will do better another time.<eos> They do not die for us. Not for us.<eos> That at least is a blessing.<eos> If this war goes on.... And it will.<eos> It will.
What did happen on the ice?<eos> I told you, Mom.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I know I've always treated her like a bratty kid sister but until yesterday I never realised how much she meant to me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd better go home now.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> - Tell Connie I was here.<eos> - I will.
He's been doing things. Terrible things.<eos> - What do you mean, terrible things?<eos> - He's got everyone fooled.<eos> Everyone thinks he's this great kid but he's really evil.<eos> He killed this dog with this thing that he made that fires steel bolts.<eos> Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie. Whoa, wait...<eos> Mark, is Wallace there?<eos> Or Susan?<eos> I tried to tell them, but they won't believe me.<eos> Nobody will.
You're gonna miss graduation.<eos> Aaron, you know...<eos> Of course I wanna be there.<eos> Seeing you getting your diploma.<eos> But I have no choice.<eos> I have to be in Davenport first thing Monday morning.<eos> You can see Sullivan!<eos> Hey, I wanna give him some marbles.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
So how did this happen?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Look, here come the three kings.<eos> It must be a miracle.<eos> - Who were they?<eos> - They're my masters.<eos> They're hideous.<eos> They're just big dogs who walk funny. You take care of them.<eos> I don't want any stupid masters.<eos> Someday you will.
What are you doing up here?<eos> - Hunting.<eos> - In a suit?<eos> - What kind of hunting?<eos> - Pink flamingos.<eos> The police have rounded up 12 of the 18 escaped prisoners.<eos> The six unaccounted for are to be considered armed and dangerous.<eos> You ever see any pink flamingos?<eos> No, sir, never have ...<eos> and never will.
But now! Now.<eos> I can't get anything.<eos> Look, there's no law that says she has to have a new dress.<eos> I say. /Father Barry won't mind.<eos> I'm not bothered about Father Barry.<eos> Look, that dress I got her last year, that one'll be fine. Oh, fine.<eos> She walks up the aisle looking like a pauper... while all her mates are clobbered up to the hilt.<eos> Will she heck look like a pauper, don't be daft!<eos> Listen, you had a Communion dress when you... were a kid, didn't you?<eos> Well so will our Coleen.
Middle-class parents don't spend half as much.<eos> That's because their kids run round in new clothes all the time.<eos> You can celebrate Communion without any fuss or expense.<eos> Oh, I know it's a Catholic tradition to lash out on... dress, flowers and photographs... but it isn't necessary.<eos> But that's all part of it.<eos> Love and prayer is enough, Bob.<eos> I don't want our Coleen missing out, Father. She won't.<eos> When she walks up that aisle...<eos> I want her to look as smart as the rest of them.<eos> Which she will.
Now I just figured it meant my life was over.<eos> Hey, I got it!<eos> Why don't we just go over... and knock on the door and ask Mr. Mertle if he can get it for us?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Mr. Mertle's the meanest old man that ever lived.<eos> He's the one who made The Beast eat that kid.<eos> It's not an option, Smalls.<eos> Forget about it!<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Sorry. I - - I will.
- No, it's great to meet you.<eos> Yes, I love you so much.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm naked, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you are naked.<eos> I was just naked then.<eos> Very nude.<eos> Nice to meet you and call me?<eos> I Will.
If 'Chunhyangga' contains 1,000 measures, practice them 10,000 times or more<eos> Until you become one spirit with the drum.<eos> Understand?<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm really sick of being disturbed.<eos> I'm sick of selling my pansori for you, too.<eos> You're speaking garbage!<eos> - What?<eos> - If you don't like it, quit<eos> I will!
All in the head?<eos> All in the head.<eos> You identified the body.<eos> Did he die right away?<eos> The coroner thought so.<eos> He was already weak from the stroke.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This must be very unsettling.<eos> Vincent, you have the opportunity to see your past in whatever light you choose, but for your future to begin, you need to understand the past you've created.<eos> I'll...
I got it. I'm f/ne.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> At least he tried to escape.<eos> He didn't just wait for them.<eos> - Heil Hitler.<eos> - Heil Hitler.<eos> Gestapo.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, they haven't caught us, have they?<eos> Well, they will.
Hurry! Hurry!<eos> You're really growing up to be quite a young lady.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You know, I don't want to rain on the day here... but you have a serious foundation problem.<eos> You see how the porch is slanted right here?<eos> I mean, this is a serious problem.<eos> We need to get up underneath here...<eos> First of all, we need to fill this in so no more water collects here.<eos> And then we'll probably...
- Yes sir?<eos> Let me show you what I've been working on.<eos> Excuse us Amanda.<eos> A rocket.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> The coming thing.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know what you're thinking: that she'll never fly.<eos> - Of course she will.
In actual fact, he did pay Major Plank £1 ,000 for the object.<eos> Why on earth did he tell Uncle Tom he only paid a fiver?<eos> He acted from a desire to exasperate Mr Travers.<eos> Mr Travers is a collector, and collectors are never pleased when they learn that a rival has acquired an objet d'art of great value at a nugatory price.<eos> If you could let me off here, sir.<eos> Why do you want to get out here?<eos> Sir Watkyn has now discovered the absence of the statuette, sir, Constable Oates and the Earl of Sidcup are conducting the investigation.<eos> Oh, my lord, Jeeves, two minds with not a single thought.<eos> Indeed, sir. I think it wise if I alight here with the statuette and smuggle it into the dining room.<eos> No, I won't!
- So, what did you do?<eos> - Well, I got the hell out of there.<eos> They took Babu away.<eos> They took Babu away?<eos> Yeah, the immigration guy said his visa was expired.<eos> Poor Babu. Everything was going so well for him.<eos> He had an apartment, he had a job.<eos> - What a shame.<eos> Help me!<eos> I will, Babu!
"Start." Okay. I could see how you need that.<eos> But once we're going, okay. Once it's all happening what do we need him for then?<eos> I don't see the cellist looking up, "I'm confused.<eos> I don't know what to do."<eos> Then the conductor go, "Do this.<eos> Like this...." "Oh, okay, thank you.<eos> Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it.<eos> I'm never gonna meet anybody.<eos> I should accept it.<eos> -Oh, yes, you will. -No, I won't.
I've seen you do it three times.<eos> If she lives, I die.<eos> Everything that you and I have dies with me.<eos> What we have is a dream.<eos> I wouldn't trade it for anything, but it's still just a dream.<eos> Nidell's dream.<eos> She won't remember any of it, will she?<eos> There's no way to be sure.<eos> I love you, Benjamin.<eos> And I always will.
All right. How about the letters?<eos> The letters came first.<eos> I don't know who's writing them.<eos> Shit, but they're reading my mind.<eos> Those are my thoughts.<eos> I hate her.<eos> It made me think I could do it.<eos> But I would never hurt the baby. I would never hurt Fletcher!<eos> - You must stop it.<eos> - We will.
I mean, you kind of have to, right?<eos> - Yeah, I never thought of that.<eos> Yeah. - I gotta bail.<eos> You coming?<eos> No, you guys blow.<eos> I'm waiting on Cassandra.<eos> She's gonna help me with my history.<eos> Wait.<eos> I kinda loaned her Kimberly's yellow leather jacket, so don't tell her, all right?<eos> - OK. I won't.
She says disobedient women who leave home... " end up wallowing in the filthy river of sin. "<eos> I think she meant Gertrudis.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> It's been so good to see you.<eos> I have a favor to ask.<eos> Tell my mother that you saw me... that I'm fine... and that I'll never go back to the ranch.<eos> Can you guess what I'm thinking?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
Help me, mama... Please.<eos> Of course I'll help you,<eos> I promise.<eos> Who is it?<eos> If it's not him I marry, I'll die.<eos> But who is it?<eos> The officer who saved me...<eos> His name is Jean-Baptiste.<eos> And does he love you?<eos> He will.
No, that small one, over by the trees.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> He said this was your stick.<eos> He said it's all right now, he's found a good place.<eos> And if you behave yourself, you can go with them.<eos> He said he'll teach you big magic.<eos> He said he's never met a man like you before.<eos> And maybe, he never will again.
Qiu Ju wasn't doing well when I left<eos> So I didn't wait for the results I came straight home<eos> You know too, don't you? This isn't the first time I took a pregnant woman to the hospital<eos> This has nothing to do with the lawsuit<eos> When Qiu Ju is well Let her sue me if she wants<eos> If I lose, I lose if you lose, you lose<eos> Let bygones by bygones<eos> I can't offer you much today<eos> Come for a proper feast when the baby's a month old<eos> We will
- You call my father bill?<eos> - What am i supposed to call him?<eos> Even my mother calls him wiliam.<eos> Listen, i didn't mean anything by that.<eos> I'm sorry, really.<eos> He's not coming. I know it.<eos> He's left me behind.<eos> I know he has.<eos> Oh, hey, come on. He wouldn't do that. He'll be here.<eos> He will.
You guys shoulda been at Gasworks Friday.<eos> - Yeah, we were.<eos> - This band, Crucial Taunt, they had this megababe lead singer...unreal!<eos> Phil, we were there.<eos> Have you gone mental?<eos> Hello?<eos> - I think we should go now.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> You think it's wise to sell a show we don't own?<eos> - By tonight, we will.
What?<eos> Haven't you taken enough advantage?<eos> Not yet!<eos> You're crushing it!<eos> Have you stared enough?<eos> So what?<eos> Want a fight?<eos> I'm not scared!<eos> Judge, the vehicle is coming...<eos> Sure it will!
Were you seeking us?<eos> Had you seen us already?<eos> Never yet have I seen so fair a company:<eos> do you not think me right in calling you fair?<eos> - Then you do not mean to harm us?<eos> - l could not do so.<eos> Yet you have caused us many woes!<eos> You smote our playmates!<eos> Who now will play with us?<eos> I will, gladly!
You know, you haven't told me why you've come to my rescue, Batman.<eos> Are you getting soft on criminals or just on me?<eos> - I think the fever is making you delusional.<eos> - Ever the escape artist, I see.<eos> What's this?<eos> Isis bit me. It's not her fault.<eos> They did something to her.<eos> All the animals.<eos> Must save Isis.<eos> And we will.
It just popped out.<eos> - Well, how did she react?<eos> - She flipped out.<eos> Just left. Well, that's not offensive.<eos> It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.<eos> Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this.<eos> I mean, especially the pantie remark.<eos> I mean, it's embarrassing. She'd never let me hear the end of it.<eos> What if this girl says something?<eos> She will.
I don't see the cellist looking up, "I'm confused.<eos> I don't know what to do."<eos> And the conductor goes, "Do this.<eos> Like this..."<eos> "Oh, okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much."<eos> Why try anymore? There's no sense to it.<eos> I'll never meet anybody.<eos> I should accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will. - No, I won't.
- Wait, I need my spare keys.<eos> Oh, here's your damn keys.<eos> You keep them. - I don't want them anymore.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want my keys back from you.<eos> - I can't hold them?<eos> - No, you can't be trusted.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> - And I don't want you to hold mine.<eos> - Good, I won't!
- Or stay.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a blizzard out there.<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> You'll never get a cab.<eos> - I can go make you a burger and fries.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> And no, I really shouldn't stay.<eos> (Please! )<eos> - But I will.
I'm kissing it all goodbye. These four stinking walls, six flights up. The L that roars by at 3:00 a.m. Like a cast-iron wind.<eos> Kiss them goodbye for me, Maury, I'll miss them.<eos> - Like hell I will.
I thought I might.<eos> I mean, we got ourselves a loaded truck, an unloaded camper, a car wreck...<eos> - I think they can use my help.<eos> - Marcia?<eos> Are there any jobs down at the phone company?<eos> What, you need a job?<eos> Ah, you want Clifford home.<eos> Well, I was just thinking.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I won't go...<eos> You've seen a ghost?<eos> Damn you!<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm sick.<eos> Do you really know magic?<eos> You've made them impossible to see Mr. Ding.<eos> This is called...<eos> If I say I know magic, will you believe me?<eos> I will!
Forgive me, my husband, for leaving you so soon.<eos> I'm so scared, Connor.<eos> I wanted to stay and love you.<eos> The sun is killing us.<eos> Help the ones that are still alive.<eos> Hold my hand.<eos> Promise me, Connor.<eos> Anything.<eos> Promise me you'll do something to stop this.<eos> Aye, love. I will.
Can I have your friend's head back?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I should get to work.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Come back, they all do!<eos> Don't they?<eos> What a weekend!<eos> We have sun, earth, and atmosphere, so we have weather!<eos> Good weather, sun, sun, sun, sun, sun! It will...
Very stupid.<eos> So, if you ain't doing it, who's gonna be...<eos> Nobody.<eos> We're all bosses here.<eos> What then, Charlie?<eos> We're gonna vote on everything?<eos> That's right.<eos> Everybody here is equal.<eos> Corporations have a board of directors.<eos> So will we.
It's been that way since the Revolution.<eos> When they moved into this house, they got rid of all the furniture - all of it.<eos> Now they see me and... I seem so Americanised.<eos> And you have an American wife.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> The last thing I wanted was to insult them...<eos> I know.<eos> Honey, it's going to seem strange for a while, but, believe me, they want to love you.<eos> They will.
- Here. Catch.<eos> - My nails!<eos> - Throw me the ball.<eos> - Throw you the ball?<eos> Coach, are you trying to kill yourself?<eos> - I'm not quitting, Bernard.<eos> You hear? - Then I'll smoke.<eos> No, you're not smoking. You're not smoking.<eos> Then throw them out.<eos> - All right. I will.
- Martin, I don't know the doctor.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> Young, good-looking.<eos> Outfitting his sailboat down there.<eos> He says you've been staring at him from the window all day.<eos> Does it give you that much pleasure to humiliate me?<eos> Stop it!<eos> - Now you'll sulk, won't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I don't think I can shoot anybody !<eos> I'm gonna blow you up !<eos> This is called black powder Bob !<eos> Here you go !<eos> How much is this ?<eos> 20 pounds worth !<eos> You understand don't you ?<eos> That there is no other solution !<eos> You won't go away ! - I will !<eos> - No you won't !
Young lady, remove yourself.<eos> You must leave!<eos> Sonora Webster is officially suspended from school for one week.<eos> I'm informing your aunt.<eos> No one talks to her.<eos> She's not here!<eos> Two red ones and... a green one.<eos> No, ma'am, please, right here.<eos> Sonora, tell your aunt that her blue thread will be here in a few days.<eos> - OK, I will.
Everyone else has.<eos> Ever since Paris.<eos> Ever since Cybill killed herself.<eos> Cybill's death was a sailing accident.<eos> - That's what I am - a survivor.<eos> - Tiffany!<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> Sorry for the both of us.<eos> Sorry for the child that... we never had.<eos> - And never will!
Daddy!<eos> Come down from there and help me to bed!<eos> Daddy!<eos> I said now!<eos> He's gone.<eos> Fool?<eos> Meet me at the window. You know the one.<eos> OK.<eos> - You find him, bring him back to me.<eos> - I will!
Give me something sharp.<eos> Everybody here. Men first.<eos> Closer! Then women, after them old men and children.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Put the old man under the bench.<eos> What do you want?<eos> It's me...<eos> Stay there.<eos> What happened?<eos> Quiet, will you.
Well I can hardly leave him or I would've been at the railway station to meet you.<eos> Well, you see,<eos> Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Australia.<eos> Australia?<eos> In Victoria at the mines, the gold mines, that's where dad made all his money.<eos> You have been of material assistance to me.<eos> Will you be able to see James?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Tell him that I know him to be innocent.<eos> I will.
This is what I want to do.<eos> But we have less than an hour.<eos> You're a wise and experienced leader. I assume you trust your senses.<eos> I would say so.<eos> And your senses tell you this woman is the most powerful force on Ventax?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then what would you say if I told you that she has no powers whatsoever?<eos> We have seen her powers here.<eos> That's right.<eos> And you will again.
It has been too long, my brother.<eos> Too long.<eos> We have much to discuss.<eos> I have asked Gowron to restore our family honour. He has refused.<eos> Gowron won't live to see the day he leads the Council.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He stands alone, surrounded by his enemies.<eos> Lursa and B'Etor would have him killed.<eos> And if they don't, I will.<eos> You will?
I have withheld you since that night.<eos> Don't.<eos> Oh, I wanna hold you.<eos> I wanna go back.<eos> God, if you could just -<eos> - Please, don't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have you told her?<eos> - God no.<eos> Never. I- I never will!
I still don't understand.<eos> Well, let's examine the word.<eos> Hope less.<eos> Less than hopeful.<eos> That's what you are.<eos> But am I majorly hopeless or partially hopeless?<eos> I would say majorly.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> - I'll try to change.<eos> - No, you won't.
Fucking bastard.<eos> Get off me.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You want me to beg?<eos> I'm begging. Save my life.<eos> Please.<eos> Save my life.<eos> Relatives and friends, we are gathered here in the sight of God and the presence of these witnesses to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.<eos> Will thou, Minifield Gilliam, have this woman to be thy wedded wife?<eos> I will.
Stop it!<eos> You want me to beg?<eos> I'm begging. Save my life.<eos> Please.<eos> Save my life.<eos> Relatives and friends, we are gathered here in the sight of God and the presence of these witnesses to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.<eos> Will thou, Minifield Gilliam, have this woman to be thy wedded wife?<eos> I will.<eos> Will thou, Indigo Downes, have this man to be thy wedded husband?<eos> I will.
What if we can't?<eos> Are you willing to take that chance?<eos> Besides, Evans City is a war zone.<eos> I've been there.<eos> It'll take a lot more than five miles to get any help.<eos> There's a gas pump out by the shed.<eos> My uncle keeps it locked.<eos> - You know where the key is?<eos> - No, but I can hunt for it.<eos> We will, but not now.
We'll be cornered down there.<eos> - There's still some way to escape.<eos> - A way out is a way in.<eos> The windows!<eos> - We can board them up.<eos> - There's no time...<eos> There's only three of them.<eos> I've handled more by myself.<eos> - The cellar door won't hold them.<eos> - But the windows will?
Straight ahead.<eos> - Who're these shits? - Employees.<eos> Nobody move!<eos> It's okay!<eos> The hell it is!<eos> Nothing's okay!<eos> Open the door!<eos> I can't open it.<eos> Tell them to open the door!<eos> They won't.
Give me your name.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Hey, pops, you the D.A? Here.<eos> Eat.<eos> What music have you provided? I need music in the kitchen.<eos> Vanya?<eos> They dried up the Sea of Aral, the kikes did.<eos> We have our own music.<eos> Lyosha is gonna play for us.<eos> No, I won't.
- Good.<eos> - If I betray your confidence, you could have me sacked and unemployable within the week.<eos> - I'm going to confide in you, am I?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> Everyone says, "Francis Urquhart could tell you the answer, but he won't."<eos> Well, at this stage in my career, I need to understand more than I need scoops.<eos> I need a friend in high places, Mr Urquhart.<eos> And I think you'd like to talk to me.<eos> And nobody knows I'm here tonight.<eos> And nobody will.
What else could it be?<eos> All right. Did he give you a phone number?<eos> Well, he didn't give it, but we got it.<eos> Good. Trace it.<eos> Get the address.<eos> Mr. Zamora.<eos> Mr. Maddox, I hope you're calling about the Harrison gun.<eos> As a matter of fact, I am.<eos> You have... You... You have the gun?<eos> I will.
Well, there's talk around the town.<eos> I mean, her with her curled hair and her white overall!<eos> Of course he swears it's all right. But then he would, wouldn't he?<eos> - It makes me cold, talking like this.<eos> - Well, let's us then be practical.<eos> - You return to Polgarwith today, right?<eos> - Yes. There is a train at five.<eos> Et bien, tomorrow, captain Hastings and I will follow you there.<eos> - I don't want it to be any talk.<eos> We will the discretion itself.
That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> In.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Now let go of the bar. I can't.<eos> What are you, a wimp?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let go of the bar!<eos> I'll fall.<eos> No, you won't.
[ Al ] Well, I think maybe you're gonna find out.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Flying Panzinis.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> When you are up there and the spotlight hits--<eos> Please direct your attention to ring one.<eos> Wave to the crowd.<eos> And in ring three with our performing elephants.<eos> I must have forgotten.<eos> Just don't forget next time.<eos> I won't, Papa.
May I say goodbye to Dr Soong, sir?<eos> Alone, sir.<eos> Everybody dies, Data.<eos> Well, almost everybody.<eos> Do you believe that we are in some way alike, sir?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In many ways, I'd like to believe.<eos> Then it is alright for you to die, because I will remain alive.<eos> You know that I cannot grieve for you, sir.<eos> You will.
You will have to be here completely to help her back.<eos> You must open yourself to time and space and the intricate threads that bind them.<eos> Begin entering your warp field equations.<eos> Now close your eyes.<eos> See past the numbers.<eos> Trust yourself.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> When the time comes, you will, Wesley.<eos> You will.
But it's too late.<eos> You're practically a cinch to run into the other chauffeur.<eos> No, I can make it.<eos> Then do it.<eos> Go on, get moving.<eos> I'll see you back at the house.<eos> No, no. Get back in the car.<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> About this little ride of ours. I'd appreciate it if you didn't say anything about it.<eos> I won't.
- Babies can be very ratty in their sleep.<eos> - Oh, no, not him. - I'm sure he always sleeps sweetly.<eos> - Yes, but I'm not a baby.<eos> I never said you were.<eos> I only said that you slept like a baby.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> Robert is very keen for you to stay and have dinner with us.<eos> He told me not to let you have your clothes till you agreed.<eos> You must be starving, anyway.<eos> So you will?
She's Lulu.<eos> -Lulu! That's cute!<eos> Want to come and have a bite?<eos> To eat?<eos> I may sound Andalusian, but I ain't.<eos> I'm from Medellin, a small town.<eos> You know, the cradle of conquerors...<eos> I'm worried about having hit you.<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> -I won't.
Felipe.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> - All the time.<eos> - I told you he was American.<eos> - L. Isten. We can't dec. Ide.<eos> - What you want. Is a da. Iqu.<eos> Daiquiris. Dos.<eos> - And what if I don't like it?<eos> - You will.
See you tomorrow, beverly.<eos> beverly Marsh.<eos> beverly Marsh.<eos> -Look, it's the fat boy.<eos> -top of the day, fat boy.<eos> -What do you want?<eos> -to teach you something, porky.<eos> You like to Iearn, don't you?<eos> -I want you to remember my name.<eos> -I will, Henry.
- Me?<eos> You want me to be in charge? You don't even know me.<eos> I know all about you, Chas.<eos> I know where you live, I know where you work.<eos> I even know who you sleep with.<eos> And I have always known that you'd be the one to take David's place, should the occasion arrive.<eos> And that time has come now.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready for all this.<eos> - Nobody was supposed to get hurt.<eos> - And no one else will.
Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere.<eos> Leaving him on Earth would not protect him.<eos> But the Earth won't be ordered to the Neutral Zone.<eos> My command sent his mother to her death.<eos> She understood her mission and my duty.<eos> Will he?<eos> In time... and with help.<eos> Wesley Crusher does.<eos> He does.<eos> And so will Jeremy.
By the way, father, you left me the dead there and I passed the night with many nausea...<eos> Now I thought that I want to be bullfighter.<eos> What do you have to do?<eos> It's not decent, Remedios, of course not!<eos> I'm out to diagnose a nephritic colic, that turns to be not a nephritic colic, but a kidney-cracking due to bad postures, and to exercise my right to vote, and when I'm back, I found two mouths that I need to feed.<eos> You tell me, Remedios, what kind of life is this?<eos> I told her, Mr. Alonso.<eos> I warned her.<eos> Who of the two is voting?<eos> Or the two of us will?
I go to bed sick and I get up scared.<eos> I don't like being sick inside all the time.<eos> Do think I like being afraid that you won't come back.<eos> Look I have an idea. Bear with me a second.<eos> Keep an open mind because it is a pretty radical idea.<eos> Al told me about a training school in Flat Rock, Colorado.<eos> They need a commanding officer and I was wondering why don't I take you to Colorado and you could be my girl and I could teach those geeks to fight fires.<eos> You know, put out a cigar at 200 feet and I'd come home every night and we'd have an apartment with a microwave oven.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> I won't.
From Geneva airport.<eos> - When will you get back? - Today.<eos> The flight is almost due.<eos> Tell her you love her! Come on!<eos> I have something important to tell you<eos> - We can talk when you return.<eos> - l may not be able to say it then.<eos> - Don't feel shy.<eos> Tell her.<eos> - l will.
- They'll fix crab. All that trouble.<eos> She's just worked up.<eos> Here's $50 in case you have trouble.<eos> Don't show it to Mama!<eos> - Have you got a map?<eos> - She's got it in the back seat.<eos> It's 7:16!<eos> You should have a job on the radio announcing the time.<eos> - I want to miss rush hour.<eos> - You will.
I can't.<eos> All my references have switched.<eos> Nothing, nothing is the same anymore.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't know.<eos> You can't.<eos> I went along with them.<eos> You never did.<eos> I went along with them. I believed their lies.<eos> But your son won't.
Lord Learoyd, the Rajah Rayah!<eos> An Aussie patrol was shot up yesterday.<eos> Men have died.<eos> You made a deal, signed a treaty.<eos> MacArthur signed it.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> They are not gonna tolerate any kings running around in the hills.<eos> He'll never come down, sir.<eos> He won't toe the line.<eos> He will, poor devil, one way or another.
Kikina presents<eos> She never goes out anymore...<eos> she won't come.<eos> Yes, she will
Sorry Mr Phillips couldn't be here. I'll play those tapes for him soon as he gets back.<eos> Are you sure we recorded enough, Mr Clement?<eos> I can play anything you want.<eos> You're good, boy, but a piano ain't never gonna make you no money.<eos> Little girls like guitar players nowadays.<eos> They like to watch 'em wiggle around.<eos> You can't do that behind a piano.<eos> So, what did Mr Sam Phillips think of the great Jerry Lee Lewis?<eos> - He ain't heard him yet.<eos> - But he will.
Goodness, all this money!<eos> Saved, we are saved.<eos> We'll never manage it.<eos> - Yes, everyone will help.<eos> - Who is everyone?<eos> You can't put the lads up to their necks in this.<eos> It would be tempting the devil.<eos> You don't mean to say...<eos> That we're dishonest?<eos> No, of course, but other people will.
- There's one person crazy enough... to put you in the ring with Tong Po.<eos> Name's Xian.<eos> - Lives out in the sticks.<eos> - Will he do it?<eos> I don't have any fuckin' idea.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> - I just know how to find him.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - What if he doesn't take you?<eos> - He will.
- Loosen up, Bow.<eos> - Willie, got one poured for you.<eos> - Not for me, thanks.<eos> All you do is exercise.<eos> You gotta live a little.<eos> My astronaut training starts in two days.<eos> Forget space cadet.<eos> I'll drink hers.<eos> What happens if he goes back and finds the bottle missing?<eos> He won't.
Don't touch this, OK?<eos> OK, we'll guard it with our lives.<eos> - Dan, it was Krueger.<eos> - What?<eos> It happened while I was awake. Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> Now, wait a second. How could...<eos> He must have dreamt himself up. I don't know.<eos> Jesus, Dan, I'm scared.<eos> All right. Stay right there. I'm on my way.<eos> OK, I will.
Trying to help Madam Rose create miracles.<eos> You're right. I can't measure up.<eos> Please tell her we've done our best.<eos> Now I am powerless. At this hour?<eos> What other hours you have in mind?<eos> The marriage will be destroyed.<eos> Consider we never helped her.<eos> That's beating a hasty retreat. Yes, I'm beating a hasty retreat.<eos> I won't tell her that. I've a heart.<eos> You... I won't either.
But he could have.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> But he could have.<eos> But he didn't, Gil!<eos> You threw him 1 2 million pop-ups in the backyard.<eos> You cut the odds considerably.<eos> If he hadn't...<eos> But there's three of them, and you wanna have four, and the fourth one could be Larry, and they're gonna do a lot of things. I mean, baseball's the least of it.<eos> And in all those things, sometimes they're going to miss.<eos> Sometimes they won't.
No, my case is airtight.<eos> I have got motive, I've got method,<eos> I've got the murder weapon with matching blood.<eos> That's because Joe was framed.<eos> We've got the alibi.<eos> Paris put this guy up to it.<eos> A lot of people owe him favors.<eos> Your alibi is a fabrication.<eos> Prove it.<eos> I will.
Yes, a pretty dog!<eos> He's a pretty dog!<eos> Rose residence.<eos> - Susan, is that for me?<eos> - lt's for Josh.<eos> - Are you expecting a call?<eos> - Jason Larrabee said he'd confirm lunch.<eos> I'm trying to land him as a client.<eos> The word around town is he's up for a Cabinet post. I wish he'd call.<eos> He will.
Please!<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Peter! No!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> The good Sister was kind enough to care for a wounded traitor like Enrique.<eos> Is your friend as important?<eos> No!<eos> You'll kill him.<eos> Yes, I will.
Why do you want them back?<eos> You can have more.<eos> You're trifling with our primal instincts.<eos> I must warn you that humans are willing to die for their children.<eos> Returning the children is non-negotiable.<eos> I promise you, they will have a beautiful life with us.<eos> And they'll be parents to a new breed born of an ancient culture.<eos> But how can you be sure that they can have children?<eos> You can't.<eos> But they will.
Why are you so interested in stopping the kumite?<eos> Someone almost got killed there today.<eos> I have a friend fighting in it. I don't want him to get hurt.<eos> Who is your friend?<eos> His name is Frank Dux.<eos> You guys here for the finals?<eos> There aren't going to be any finals, Dux, at least not for you.<eos> Don't try to stop me.<eos> We're not.<eos> He will.
Quit screwing around and help me up.<eos> You look great, man.<eos> Be careful with those now.<eos> We got a boy going to the Show.<eos> Sorry about last night.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I have been known on occasion to... howl at the moon.<eos> You understand?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you will.
We make selling chocolates popular.<eos> We make it cool to sell the things.<eos> We spread the word.<eos> We organize.<eos> We get the student officers. We get the homeroom officers.<eos> We get the members of the student council. All the kids with influence.<eos> Do or die for Trinity.<eos> Everybody sells.<eos> Not everybody's gonna wanna sell 50 boxes, Archie.<eos> But they will, Obie.

Wait, Mary!<eos> I love you.<eos> I know that.<eos> You do?<eos> When did you know that?<eos> The minute I saw ya.<eos> The minute I knew I loved you... but your love must be true.<eos> It is.<eos> It must withstand all obstacles.<eos> It will.
'Accessory to a suicide'.<eos> We could go to the police.<eos> I understand!<eos> But please promise me...<eos> Promise you...?<eos> I will do whatever you want... but afterwards, please let us leave safely, together.<eos> I won't contact the police.<eos> Please promise.<eos> Madam - you won't go to the cops?<eos> I never will.
Wow, that poor girl.<eos> Her father seems to take his act a little too seriously.<eos> I think they really want us out of here.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm afraid this place is off-limits to all except magicians.<eos> But of course.<eos> I am the great Montarro and I have come to grace your contest.<eos> I've never heard of ya.<eos> You will.
Harry!<eos> Are you sure you can't stay a Iittle longer?<eos> - I gotta get back home.<eos> - What's the rush?<eos> A Iot of things to do.<eos> I'm gonna fix that leak in the roof.<eos> It's gotta last me another 20 years.<eos> Another day.<eos> I still miss them.<eos> We always will.
- Zenon, you've returned son.<eos> Two weeks I walked from Germany.<eos> Roman is in Warsaw with his wife,<eos> Mother, tired aren't you?<eos> Come, eat.<eos> Don't be upset, Mother.<eos> You'll see how we fix this up, son.<eos> Look at how Staszek has grown.<eos> Staszek it's your brother - what are you afraid of?<eos> I'll back in a tick
Don't worry, Mother.<eos> I won't leave.<eos> Don't worry, Mother.<eos> Nobody... will...<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> No one is going to leave here.<eos> No one.<eos> Don't worry, Mother.<eos> I won't leave.<eos> Nobody will.
I won't leave.<eos> Don't worry, Mother.<eos> Nobody... will...<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> No one is going to leave here.<eos> No one.<eos> Don't worry, Mother.<eos> I won't leave.<eos> Nobody will.<eos> Nobody will.
Remember we owe it to them, John!<eos> John!<eos> Leave this instant!<eos> Why, John, why?<eos> Get away, fly away!<eos> Fly, fly, fly!<eos> Come home!<eos> Come home!<eos> No!<eos> No, no I won't!
As long as we play in that club, he's not gonna leave us alone.<eos> How about it, Mark?<eos> Let's quit that job.<eos> Jack, I know what you mean.<eos> But, until you get anotherjob, you must continue to play there.<eos> How else can you pay for school?<eos> No job. No money.<eos> I don't want us to drop out,<eos> I just don't want anything to happen to us.<eos> Nothing will, Jack.
But we are both not!<eos> Nicola and I went to see our father in his house in the country, to say good buy...<eos> We had decided to leave Italy and go to America.<eos> We won't return until we earn enough dollars to buy our company back.<eos> One day we'll work together again in our cathedrals.<eos> - I swear to you!<eos> - Me too!<eos> But you have to wait for us, father.<eos> Do not die!<eos> I will not.
His only claim to fame.<eos> Too bad he's not here, I'd like to meet him.<eos> He won't budge from his workshop.<eos> He could've picked you up with the truck. He knew you were coming, the dog!<eos> Drink that, it's hot.<eos> You're pale as a ghost!<eos> I'm glad you brought him to me, Claire.<eos> Should've done it sooner.<eos> I thought it'd work out.<eos> It will!
Now, and forever!<eos> Your champion.<eos> Witness this moment, He-Man.<eos> This moment when the powers of Greyskull will become mine for eternity.<eos> Our lifelong battle is ending at last in the only way it could.<eos> Holosphere standing by.<eos> When the Great Eye opens the people of Eternia shall see you kneeling to me just before you die.<eos> I'll never kneel to you!<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> Yes, you will!
Don't do that. She's asleep.<eos> - She's asleep.<eos> - Look all the flowers on Foncica.<eos> My brother sent her a blue flower.<eos> I can only see things in my house.<eos> Things in my house are very bad.<eos> I don't know what to advise my son.<eos> I think he should pay for the wedding... but it's important that he don't look ridiculous.<eos> - Why don't you talk to him?<eos> - I will.
Thanks to Chandler.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> Gonna be a big surf star, yeah?<eos> Fit in with all the locals.<eos> [Laughs] [Joe] Vince Moaloka coming in from the water... grabs a perfect tube.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Do I get you to myself for awhile?<eos> You know, if I go to New York, you could come with me.<eos> I mean, I got a partial scholarship, and... we could both work. We could get by.<eos> Will you?
Just wait.<eos> When does it get good?<eos> Keep your shirt on and let me read.<eos> "Westley had no money for marriage...<eos> "so he packed his few belongings and left the farm...<eos> "to seek his fortune across the sea."<eos> It was a very emotional time for Buttercup.<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> I fear I'll never see you again.<eos> Of course you will.
- Don Masino wants him.<eos> - Don Masino can go to hell. No!<eos> We don't speak of him like that.<eos> - He protects those who pay.<eos> Quintana almost killed Silvio Ferra in front of Prince Borsa's estate.<eos> Frisella says Giuliano is dying.<eos> If he was like you and me, he would die.<eos> But he is not.<eos> He has decided to live.<eos> So he will.
Spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen.<eos> That's all. Why do you need a living room and a dining room?<eos> Why do you need a backyard?<eos> You're not selling anything?<eos> I'm in a slump.<eos> It happens.<eos> Last year, I'm number three top seller.<eos> Year before, right up there.<eos> I can't get my momentum going this year.<eos> You will.
Is no one there to snatch from my head the Delphic crown, no one better suited than I myself to shave my head,<eos> as befits a balding seer—<eos> O all you powers of heaven, what's this?<eos> Begone!<eos> Who sent you here?<eos> I'll tell you everything in case you do not know;<eos> then bring all you may do into accord— Pausanias!<eos> Oh, seek not the man to whom your heart once clung, he is no more, and go, my gentle youth!<eos> Your countenance enflames my sense, and be it blessing, be it curse, with you each is much too much for me.<eos> But as you will!
It's a restaurant now.<eos> But I was sitting there, playing the piano, wearing my tuxedo, lookin' snazzy as hell?<eos> Always try to look snazzy, Edwin?<eos> When Johnnie Ray said, "Get up here, Charlie, and sing these people a song."<eos> Well, it was the first time I had the spot.<eos> Ahh, it was a Friday night.<eos> Or was it Saturday?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> Um, now, remember about the fish, Edwin.<eos> I will, I will.
Well, quite an operation, Dr Malone.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> I can't fire Woody.<eos> Well, maybe if he knew the situation, he'd wanna go.<eos> Why don't you just explain it to him, and let him draw his own conclusion?<eos> Maybe he'll volunteer to leave.<eos> He's such a sweet guy.<eos> I'll bet he will.<eos> Boy, he is a sweet guy.<eos> Of course he will.
For those of you that cried at the funeral... I just want to say that it's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Thank you, Maggie.<eos> Well, are we all ready?<eos> - This feels kind of strange, Mom.<eos> - It won't after we get started, honey.<eos> Uncle Bob called this a remembering session.<eos> When someone in my family passed on... Uncle Bob would lead us all in sharing fond memories of that person.<eos> Whom he would lovingly refer to as "The dearly defunct."<eos> Who wants to start?<eos> Okay, then, I will.
Their health is excellent,<eos> - almost too good.<eos> - There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret.<eos> Let the girl show you.<eos> We'll accept your judgment.<eos> You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.<eos> Don't you see it ?<eos> Here and here.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Laura, baby, I hate to leave, but the city just won't wait.<eos> I will.
First I want the kitchen painted.<eos> You shake hands with her and introduce yourself.<eos> Don't squeeze!<eos> Normal.<eos> Not like a damp sponge.<eos> Normal, a normal handshake.<eos> Hello, I'm Abel.<eos> You see, there's nothing to it.<eos> And then you say something.<eos> - This evening, I will.
I really have to go<eos> But, baby, it's cold outside<eos> This evening has been<eos> - So happy that you dropped...<eos> - So nice<eos> Look out the window at the storm<eos> Bill.<eos> My boy Bill<eos> I will see that he's named after me<eos> I will
How do you like Shitsville?<eos> Don't you move.<eos> You stay seated right where you are... or I'll blow your brains through your ass.<eos> The gun is empty.<eos> You never checked it, did you?<eos> So help me, I'll blow you in half.<eos> All right.<eos> Squeeze the trigger.<eos> I will.<eos> - Please. - Oh, I will.
...Miss Jackie Valentine at terminal number 23.<eos> He comes from our Silver Springs office.<eos> Welcome to the main branch.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Page.<eos> -Seems like a pretty loose guy.<eos> -That's my card.<eos> Feel free to call me.<eos> I'm Marty Phillips.<eos> My card. Feel free to call me anytime.<eos> Terry Doolittle, and I will.
I know one part of it that already does.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - Let's go see.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I sell land.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> You will destroy village?<eos> No, you will!
- My Lady.<eos> - No!<eos> Stop her!<eos> Take her!<eos> Take her!<eos> See reason!<eos> - No!<eos> - Take her!<eos> I will not!<eos> I won't!
For what?<eos> For the sake of my immortal soul.<eos> - Oh, yes!<eos> - And for the sake of our nine days.<eos> To keep their memory untarnished unbetrayed.<eos> They brought you here and told you to be silent, in the hope that I'd think they had broken you.<eos> But they got it wrong.<eos> I'd never have been able to stay true without you here.<eos> So without each other, we'd both be alive this time tomorrow.<eos> Oh, but we will.
Tomorrow.<eos> Then we could afford to get out of here.<eos> That's it. After tomorrow we could leave here together.<eos> Together?<eos> If you'll have me.<eos> Audrey, will you have me?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Marry me, Audrey.<eos> Seymour, this is so sudden.<eos> Will you?
- Everything counts, on TV.<eos> Even the presentation.<eos> I'll have a go, but I've never done it before.<eos> Stop.<eos> Slop!<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm out of practice.<eos> You'll see in 2 or 3 months...<eos> I won't.
Wrong key.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> That's no problem.<eos> Very often in the field... the dog can be your best friend. Your most faithful partner.<eos> I love dogs, and they love me.<eos> It is important to develop the master-dog relationship.<eos> If you show any fear... the dog will not respect you.<eos> -Me? -Order the dogs to sit.<eos> -They won't listen to me.<eos> They will.
I felt the same way about somebody myself.<eos> A girl?<eos> I loved her and I married her.<eos> And one day she just split.<eos> Wait, this was Andie's mom?<eos> So I haven't seen her in three years, you know, and... But I still love her just as much as I ever did, you know?<eos> You can love Andie, but that doesn't mean she'll love you back.<eos> It doesn't mean she won't, but...<eos> What I'm trying to say is you can't make it happen.<eos> It either will or it won't.
He felt curious about the room.<eos> Feeling sorry for her, he peeked into the room.<eos> It shocked the priest.<eos> The room was full of bones and skeletons.<eos> Let's save the rest for tomorrow.<eos> No. Tell me now!<eos> You'll have a nightmare.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You'll cry again.<eos> I won't .
I'll kill you.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.<eos> You must have at least some of your brother's good sense.<eos> Suck my fat one, you cheap dime-store hood.<eos> What are you going to do, shoot us all?<eos> No, just you.<eos> We're gonna get you for this.<eos> Maybe you will and maybe you won't.<eos> We will.
- That's a secret.<eos> And where are you going?<eos> I don't know<eos> That's on the way.<eos> I also don't know where I'm going.<eos> There's a clearing ahead.<eos> We'll stay the night there.<eos> Alright, I'll tell you my secret.<eos> - Only you won't tell anyone?<eos> - I won't.
Rose, everyone is finished and I checked the score.<eos> If you can pick up a spare in the last frame, we'll be leading the tournament!<eos> Consider it done, Ma.<eos> Go to it.<eos> I did it! We're in the lead!<eos> We're gonna win! We're gonna win! We're gonna win!<eos> Rose, Rose, aren't you forgetting something?<eos> We haven't bowled our last frame yet.<eos> We can still win.<eos> And we will.
- Why?<eos> Mother Miriam is very adamant about this.<eos> - You haven't shown any progress.<eos> - I'm getting to her.<eos> You're getting to all of us.<eos> - I'll have a decision by next week.<eos> - It's gone on long enough.<eos> - Joe, she didn't kill the baby.<eos> - You have proof?<eos> - I will. - When?
You will observe the rules of battle, of course.<eos> I always do.<eos> There are so many fights in Looking Glass Land.<eos> Check.<eos> Check.<eos> It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't wanna be anybody's prisoner.<eos> I just know I must become a queen if I'm ever to get home again.<eos> And you will.
Tomme, my son.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Wanadi said it is a big log jam.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lots of logs and the river...<eos> Because of that log jam, more white people will come here and enter The World and cut down more trees and take what is yours.<eos> They will not find us.<eos> We are The Invisible People.<eos> They will, Tomme.
Best man's got to dance too, you know.<eos> How about a fandango?<eos> Keep it.<eos> Where's Gardner? Where's Gardner?<eos> Well, listen, I'm gonna try and catch a ride with somebody.<eos> It's been real.<eos> Call me sometime.<eos> Arthur Andersen in Dallas.<eos> Gardner didn't say goodbye.<eos> Neither will I.
But I have to prove that he is a vampire before I kill him, Charley.<eos> Look, I know he's a vampire!<eos> I am the one who has to know, Charley.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> This is holy water.<eos> If a drop touches him, he will blister.<eos> I have asked him to drink it... while we all watch.<eos> He readily agreed.<eos> But if I'm right and you prove he is a vampire... he'll kill us all.<eos> No, he won't, Charley.
Please, go on.<eos> Anything left, butcher?<eos> Enough for a good screw.<eos> Beg your pardon, ladies.<eos> When they circumcised me, Mrs. Petrovic, there was enough skin left to make you a coat.<eos> Well done. Congratulations.<eos> You're my little hero, aren't you?<eos> Uncle.<eos> Will you buy me a football?<eos> I sure will.
No!<eos> Rufus wasn't dead to begin with.<eos> You drugged him and reduced his vital signs you lowered his body temperature.<eos> He couldn't have been dead!<eos> Do you agree that he's dead now?<eos> West, no!<eos> West, stop!<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Then you'll help me.<eos> - No! - Yes, you will.
- He's loyal, he's trustworthy--<eos> - Housebroken?<eos> Do you know this person?<eos> Not really.<eos> - Would you like a drink?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Jason, let's go to bed.<eos> Careful, she hogs all the blankets.<eos> - You snore.<eos> - Not tonight, I won't.
Sometimes he hurts me and seems to like it.<eos> That's it. It's back.<eos> The torment is back.<eos> And with it, my brilliance!<eos> - I'll put some coffee on.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I'm done.<eos> What?<eos> I love it.<eos> So will Sam. He will.
- [Eve] Great.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> - Well, there's nothing to tell.<eos> Just another series.<eos> Look, I gotta go work out.<eos> In fact, I'm running late for my health club appointment now.<eos> Scott, don't go.<eos> Look, I gotta stay in shape. That's showbiz.<eos> Look, I'll call you.<eos> I really will.
She'll bring back the fleet.<eos> There's not much time left.<eos> She can't survive on Earth.<eos> The Red Dust in the air will kill her.<eos> She's finished, Martin.<eos> - The antidote.<eos> - She took my last pill.<eos> She's got 12 hours.<eos> You've got to do this for me.<eos> I will, Martin. What?
It has to be the clone.<eos> She's had her first taste of human.<eos> Yes.<eos> A policeman.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Yes. She's growing, getting stronger... and more like us than one of them.<eos> It means that every policeman in Los Angeles will be out looking for her.<eos> - And when they find her...<eos> - They won't find her.<eos> You will.
I took her.<eos> There's nothing more need be said.<eos> Do not forget that it is I... your father's seneschal, Who is in charge... of all things here While he is away.<eos> She's not for you, nor for any man's touching... until his return, and When he does return... it may Well be that he has his own ideas... of What becomes of the maiden.<eos> Tell me now... are you bold enough to cross your father?<eos> So now... Will you help me?<eos> I'll help you, sir.<eos> Count on me.<eos> Yes, I'll help.<eos> Me, I Will.
Who?<eos> Who says that?<eos> That's a malicious lie!<eos> Do you have pupils?<eos> I don't want pupils!<eos> They get in the way.<eos> I have to have time for composition.<eos> Composition doesn't pay.<eos> You know that.<eos> That one will.
- Just like that record player.<eos> - But we like it.<eos> Isaac doesn't let us do anything.<eos> Youjust better mind until I get back.<eos> Or else, you know what happens.<eos> - Are you going through the corn?<eos> - I can't go no other way. - What if...<eos> - I said it'll be alright.<eos> - Unless you tell anybody I'm gone.<eos> - We won't.
Gorax.<eos> Mace must find the master of the beast... if they are ever to rejoin their parents.<eos> Life monitor still works, so we at least know that Dad's still alive.<eos> We just gotta figure out how to find them.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Do you know what they're probably doing right now?<eos> They're probably sitting somewhere just like we are... thinking about us, missing us.<eos> How are we gonna find them?<eos> - We will.
How can you listen to television... and hear your records at the same time?<eos> Oh, I wasn't listening to the tube, Ma. Just watching.<eos> Miss Nude America is going to be on tonight.<eos> How can you hear what she's going to say?<eos> Who cares what she says?<eos> Don't be such a smart guy.<eos> I want you to go to bed.<eos> It's almost midnight.<eos> Goodness knows we've all had a lot to deal with... these last few days.<eos> I will, Mom.
- Swear it.<eos> You have to say: "I swear".<eos> - I swear.<eos> - But only if we should get back. - Alright.<eos> I'd even accept to marry Gabriellina, just to get back.<eos> - Is it clear? - Alright.<eos> If we ever get back...<eos> A train!<eos> - I won't marry Gabriellina! - Yes you will!<eos> No, I won't!
So just shut your mouth, and get out...<eos> - I won't.<eos> - We've been thieving...<eos> I told you...<eos> - Don't you touch me!<eos> - Hit me and I'll kill you!<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> - That I'd like to see!<eos> - You will.
- I won't.<eos> - We've been thieving...<eos> I told you...<eos> - Don't you touch me!<eos> - Hit me and I'll kill you!<eos> - Me?<eos> - You.<eos> - That I'd like to see!<eos> - You will.<eos> You will.
Get Guarrigue here, fast!<eos> You wanted to see me, President?<eos> I want to settle things.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I want you to call Senanques.<eos> We're out of touch.<eos> Fix up a meeting.<eos> Impossible.<eos> He wouldn't come.<eos> Yes he will.
He's discovered something?<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> Relax.<eos> Did you hear the Zambuli shaman has come to town?<eos> Of course I've heard.<eos> I've had her arrested.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Why?<eos> What if Jabalani finds out?<eos> He never will.
Remember...<eos> McCoy!<eos> One alive, one not.<eos> Yet both in pain.<eos> What must I do?<eos> You must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.<eos> Only there can both find peace.<eos> What you ask is difficult.<eos> You will find a way, Kirk. If you honour them both, you must.<eos> I will.
You need not be jealous.<eos> I only wanted to provoke you.<eos> I thought anger would be better than grief.<eos> I'm not foolish, Jane.<eos> You formed a new tie.<eos> With whom?<eos> This man, Rivers.<eos> St. John Rivers.<eos> He's young, he's handsome, he wants to marry you.<eos> He will.
- Yes.<eos> When you were a little girl, you were like my own child to me.<eos> You were the rose of my life.<eos> - I could have you then.<eos> - You can have me now.<eos> You can marry me.<eos> You love me.<eos> But I love God more.<eos> I do love you, Meggie.<eos> I always will.
Dane... whom we loved so much in this life.<eos> Welcome him into Paradise... where there will be no more sorrow or pain... no more weeping... but only peace and joy with your Son... and with the Holy Spirit... forever...<eos> - and ever.<eos> - Amen.<eos> The Lord is merciful and kind... and rich in mercy.<eos> Man's days are like the grass.<eos> He flowers like the flowers of the field.<eos> The wind blows... and he is gone... and his place never sees him again.<eos> How will we live without him?<eos> We will.
- Sasha, stay alive!<eos> - Goodbye, Maria!<eos> Mommy, I beg you, get on the boat.<eos> It's all over, Sasha.<eos> - Shoura, please...<eos> - As if it were a dream...<eos> We'll beat them. They'll pay for what they've done.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> Shoura, write to me when you get there.<eos> I will.
And I shall call you "My Lord", My Lord.<eos> I like the cut of your jib, young fellow-me-lad.<eos> How'd you like to be my squire in the battle tomorrow?<eos> It will be a great day for we nobles.<eos> Not if we lose, Percy.<eos> If we lose, I'll be chopped to pieces.<eos> My arms will end up in Essex, my torso in Norfolk, and my genitalia in a tree somewhere in Rutland.<eos> With you at the helm, My Lord, we cannot lose.<eos> We could if we wanted to.<eos> Ah, but we won't, Percy.
- You're telling me!<eos> Sam, someday, you will realise that I am doing the right thing.<eos> Why do you always have to do the right thing?<eos> Do you see the rest of us doing it?<eos> We're happy.<eos> - May I go now?<eos> - Yeah, go on.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> By the way, just want to say, I'm glad that under all this pressure, we haven't seen that facial tic of yours.<eos> And you won't.
My wife, my other daughters are up there.<eos> In the mountains?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> I can't.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I have children too.<eos> Suppose I guarantee you the camp will not be taken until a certain time.<eos> You'd do that?<eos> I would. But if you warn the others, Robin would be quite severely--<eos> No, I won't.
I'm ready.<eos> Will you tell me why you boys want that blasted carp?<eos> It's for our mother, sir.<eos> She's going to have a baby, and she's not very well.<eos> And Mr. Pak said carp blood's the only thing that'll help her.<eos> Without it, my mother will get worse or even...<eos> You wouldn't want my mother to die, would you?<eos> Oh, please, help us.<eos> Please save her.<eos> You won't?
Down there.<eos> We had better get started.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Let us try it.<eos> Christine has to come through the door.<eos> You have to get into the office and stay out of sight.<eos> Once she gets inside, hit the button and bring the door down.<eos> Then we will have her trapped.<eos> What if he does not come?<eos> Christine will.
You'd better go, Jonathon.<eos> Um, room service. It's room 101 7.<eos> I'd like a bottle of vodka sent up right away.<eos> - Oh, that'll really help, won't it?<eos> - Yes, it will, Jonathon.<eos> A damn sight more than you will. 101 7.<eos> I asked you to go.<eos> You can't call me any more.<eos> I know.<eos> I won't.
It's 9 o'clock.<eos> Where's Paul got to?<eos> Don't worry, I'm sure he'll be back soon<eos> Poor Paul.<eos> I've not been easy to live with<eos> First of all my moods and depressions<eos> And now this illness<eos> But I do love him<eos> I always have...<eos> I always will

May I have your attention, please?<eos> Attention, please.<eos> I want to remind you that eligible to get married to His Highness Prince Jacques would be persons of female sex, and only in the exclusive case if, after trying on a ring, to be called hereafter "the ring",<eos> the ring finger of that person of female sex will, without any difficulty, penetrate the frame of the ring to be called hereafter "the ring".<eos> please, don't crowd in.<eos> I ask each of you to draw your lot from the hat, not making any fuss.<eos> Ha, your lot both in the literal and figurative sense of the word.<eos> I'm the first! I've got one!<eos> Quite a fitting evaluation.<eos> If you will.

That's nothing to giggle at.<eos> Maj is to go her own way through life, and I'm going to give her solid ground to stand on.<eos> That's enough said about that.<eos> The opera singer said he would stop by with his wife and children.<eos> Come now.<eos> Good-bye, Mama.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> I don't want you and Alma to sit gossiping about Maj's future.<eos> I'll see to that!<eos> Or rather, she will.
- Who's behind him?<eos> Oh, what are you worried about that now for?<eos> I need to know.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Talk?<eos> Or have fun?<eos> I need some answers, Sally.<eos> You're asking me to stick a gun to my head.<eos> Not if I get to him first.<eos> And I will.
- Can you?<eos> I know it's a lot to ask of a boy your age... but it seems like you're the best friend he's got.<eos> But do you have any idea what it'll be like if he...<eos> All right, then.<eos> But only if you promise me two things:<eos> That you won't drink, and that you'll come home... soon as we get settled out in California.<eos> Promise?<eos> - Cross my heart and hope to die.<eos> - And try to bring Bubba back with you?<eos> Yes ma'am, I sure will.

It's not a win or lose thing!<eos> Warsaw must understand it's time to take tough measures.<eos> If we don't take control, they will.<eos> Where will that leave us?<eos> What if we prove to Warsaw that it's a mortal threat?<eos> You have any ideas?<eos> We have to make Warsaw aware of the danger.<eos> Take the mob out into the streets, like ten years ago.<eos> - What if they don't go?<eos> - They will.
He vandalized a day room in his boarding house.<eos> This is his wife.<eos> I know her.<eos> - Really?<eos> She's in jail now.<eos> - Maybe it's not her.<eos> It's her.<eos> She made that film about Birkut, a labour hero from the 1950s.<eos> - I didn't see it.<eos> - You will.
It happened, but we can find a way out.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> I only wanted to set up at the plant... and find a nice place to live with you.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We'll hurry things up, no problem.<eos> Are you really happy?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I only want to live with you.<eos> And you will.

The way I smell my sweatshirt before I put it on.<eos> Sometimes we drive each other crazy.<eos> And then there are times we go through a period like the one we're in now.<eos> It comes over us like an unexpected wave. puppy love.<eos> I can't wait to see her.<eos> And then when I'm with her my heart beats faster.<eos> I'd expect it with somebody who's a stranger. but not somebody I've spent half my life with.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> I wish I could feel that.<eos> Oh. you will.

Power elite.<eos> Secondly, property prices.<eos> They're now triple the 1952 prices and ten times those of 1938.<eos> When the new construction plan goes into effect, profit from speculation will at least double again.<eos> Thirdly, the construction committee.<eos> Its membership is an amalgamation of the city's so... called "good families."<eos> Do you have a list?<eos> Not on that point.<eos> But you'll be sitting across from the gentlemen this afternoon.<eos> That I will.

It became so unsafe there, people couldn't stop trying to take it away from me.<eos> Now, leave me the car.<eos> Take Margit's keys and go to her place and wait there.<eos> Can you drive a motorbike?<eos> Heinrich taught me.<eos> It's outside.<eos> Now, I'll take care of Bob and everything.<eos> I'll go to the bank on Monday and take the money out.<eos> If Bob wakes up, tell him...<eos> I will.
You just made the list, buddy.<eos> And I don't like nobody touching my stuff!<eos> So just keep your meat hooks off.<eos> If I catch any of you guys in my stuff, I'll kill you.<eos> Also, I don't like nobody touching me.<eos> Now, any of you homos... touch me, and I'll kill you.<eos> Lighten up, Francis.<eos> You're all in this together.<eos> One of these men may save your life one of these days, understand?<eos> Then again, maybe one of us won't.

Do you know we're giving another caddy scholarship this year?<eos> I heard something about that, sir, but my grades in high school weren't actually all that outstanding.<eos> There are more important things than grades.<eos> Winning the caddy tournament, for instance.<eos> It might look pretty good on a young fellow's application.<eos> I'm sure going to try, sir.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.<eos> If he's as good as he says he is, he's got to play me to prove it!<eos> I will, sir.
Fore!<eos> It's a birdie!<eos> All right, Smails, that's 80 grand.<eos> Now fork it over!<eos> I'll give you nothing! Absolutely nothing, you understand!<eos> I figured as much!<eos> Hey, Moose!<eos> Rocco!<eos> Help the judge find his checkbook.<eos> Well, I, uh... oh, I will.
Quiet...<eos> Must you do this to me?<eos> Calm down, please<eos> It's not as bad as you make it<eos> You're exaggerating.<eos> We haven't come to such odds<eos> We've been through difficult moments before<eos> We'll grow old together<eos> I won't leave you<eos> You won't?

- And sacrifice Han and Leia?<eos> Ifyou choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.<eos> I cannot interfere.<eos> I understand.<eos> R2, fire up the converters.<eos> Don't give in to hate.<eos> That leads to the dark side.<eos> Strong is Vader.<eos> Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.<eos> I will.
I've been keeping a secret from you. It's just about the most important secret in my life.<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> I'm in love.<eos> A guy named Jay. You don't know him.<eos> He's much older.<eos> Yeah, guess what?<eos> I'm in his bed now.<eos> Madge?<eos> Did you cry?<eos> What the hell, maybe I will.
- Is he a big man?<eos> Let's just forget about it, OK?<eos> No, no. Answer my question.<eos> Is he a big man?<eos> Yes.<eos> Definitely sexual.<eos> Let's just change the subject, all right?<eos> Have you seen this man while you were with us?<eos> - No.<eos> - And you won't.
Why?<eos> The name just popped into my head.<eos> - Can we watch TV in the bedroom?<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> I've got to catch a red-eye to Nebraska.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Bucks.<eos> It's a job.<eos> - You said you'd go to the class.<eos> - I will.
SHOCK TREATMENT<eos> What're you holding... ?<eos> All secure, sir.<eos> Sargeant Krebs.

I know, but there is also joy in the world.<eos> Love and happiness.<eos> And even if they last but for a fleeting moment it would be worthwhile to live there.<eos> Then let it be so, according to your wish.<eos> Live and suffer.<eos> But you will never be able to return to us.<eos> As you will be making your way amongst the people I'll provide you with a beautiful girl's name:<eos> Marenka.<eos> I want to have wings immediately.<eos> You will.
Faulty flower, c-captain Bluto.<eos> Mrs. Oyl, Olive's--<eos> Olive's what?<eos> Getting ready.<eos> Getting ready.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Uh, she won't marry you...<eos> She...<eos> She will!
There.<eos> You bothering' me about a steak?<eos> I agree.<eos> He should be with Tommy.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Tommy keeps telling me to work this out.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> - You are? I'm his brother.<eos> - Who better to talk to him?<eos> - I will.
You deserve it because you cheated others<eos> But not only did you get punished... All the workers suffered too<eos> That's true. I shouldn't involve everyone<eos> But I made it the first time<eos> No one got a pay cut<eos> It would be fine if we stop then I shouldn't have continued the act<eos> Do you really think I know Kung Fu?<eos> I can't do anything<eos> You ought to learn some useful skill<eos> All right, I will
This is something that Tognazzi.<eos> It makes me laugh just looking at him.<eos> Have your chewing gum!<eos> - You clean hands?<eos> - Yes. Why ? Can you keep me?<eos> - Compliments.<eos> - Lauridana! I had not seen you!<eos> Delightful!<eos> More and more beautiful !<eos> Mr. Tognazzi, if you will.
Nice to meet you. You too.<eos> It's amazing. There's hardly any family resemblance. No offence.<eos> We're just barely cousins.<eos> See, my mother was a French cancan dancer.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Say, how've you been getting along? Swell.<eos> Just swell. A few ups and downs.<eos> You know, people see movies about prison life but until you've actually spent time here it's hard to get the real flavour of what it's like.<eos> More Americans should spend time behind bars to understand.<eos> More Americans probably will.
Come on, Mieze!<eos> See you some other time, Reinold.<eos> Yes, I'll see you sometime.<eos> I must see that chick alone once.<eos> And what's that got to do with me?<eos> You must set it up.<eos> He introduced her to you, and she trusts you now.<eos> I don't think she likes me so much.<eos> I'm not helping you with a dirty trick like that.<eos> No way! - You really won't?
- You must do your best to stop a war.<eos> John, this is ridiculous.<eos> You say you're eons ahead of me and you want me to stop a war on a planet I know nothing about?<eos> - Why don't you stop it?<eos> - Apollo... I can't expect you to understand laws that transcend you by many generations.<eos> The simple truth is, I cannot be seen by the people of Terra outside the environment of this ship.<eos> I have no physical body as you know it.<eos> - What do you call that?<eos> - A reflection of intelligence.<eos> My spirit, if you will.
- What do you want?<eos> - Got your tea for you, dear.<eos> - Just leave it outside the room.<eos> Yes, all right, dear.<eos> Sybil?<eos> I'm not speaking to you, Basil.<eos> Could I just have my electric razor, dear?<eos> Just for the guests?<eos> Thank you, dear. Look, look...<eos> - Basil, will you...
- Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> All right.<eos> Now.<eos> We are rolling.<eos> We're rolling down that runway... faster and faster.<eos> - I don't feel any thrust.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> You will !<eos> You will. All right, all right.
It's simple, he'll just bounce off!<eos> The sod!<eos> He'll hit it there. Then there. Then he'll bounce off, the sod!<eos> Like billiards!<eos> He'll get in there.<eos> He'll get in there.<eos> We should have put the big one there.<eos> At speed, he'll get in.<eos> - What?<eos> - He will.

We don't make good citizens, but we make good prisoners.<eos> Burglary, armed robbery, grand larceny...<eos> You've escaped from quite a few prisons, haven't you?<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket.<eos> I was specially chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape.<eos> Since I've been warden some have tried to escape.<eos> Most have been recaptured. Those who haven't have been killed or drowned in the bay.<eos> No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.<eos> And no one ever will.

I thought I`d go to St. Louis `cause that`s where that radio show was from.<eos> And remember, the Lord loves a working man.<eos> -"Lord loves a working man."<eos> -And son don`t never, ever trust Whitey.

Okay, Carlin. You're really for it this time.<eos> Banks and Richards have both named you.<eos> You'll get three years for this, scum!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, sir.<eos> You fucking well will, toerag.<eos> I run this wing. I'm not having it disrupted by a dirty little backstreet villain like you.<eos> You'll sign a statement downstairs.<eos> I've got nothing to say, sir.<eos> I'd like to see the housemaster. Oh, you will, Carlin.<eos> You will.

The world sneers at us.<eos> Can 't even dream of better fate.<eos> We should crave blood...<eos> ...crave blood for our blood.<eos> The heart aches when we see our sons.<eos> Our grandsons give us disgrace.<eos> What do you think?<eos> In bondage The heads got used to yokes.<eos> When will he come? The one who frees us?<eos> He will not.
Cylon, Red Eye - he was wearing a Colonial pistol.<eos> Martin's?<eos> One day, Lacerta appeared with Red Eye.<eos> We'd never seen him before.<eos> And Martin went crazy the moment he saw him.<eos> I couldn't stop him.<eos> He ran into the bedroom where he kept his pistol and when he came out...<eos> That was nine yahrens ago and I can still see it like it just happened.<eos> - And you never told Puppis? - No.<eos> And neither will my brother.
We can't see each other as long as that cop is around.<eos> We have to be discreet.<eos> Now you talk about discretion?<eos> You didn't talk like that before.<eos> Not when you told me I had to shave!<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Come on, stop crying.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> Don't abandon me.<eos> I won't.

- Let's get some sleep.<eos> ...power crises throughout Europe and parts of Asia, where a state of martial law will take effect in scattered areas this evening.<eos> Citizens there have been asked to understand the dire, dire consequences of this phenomenon.<eos> The Southern Hotel and Motel Association of America today issued a strong denial that troubles...<eos> All your decisions made?<eos> Do you wanna abort it?<eos> Do you?<eos> Somebody better sit watch all the time.<eos> - They'll never get through there.<eos> - Enough of them will.

Whether we unbuckle instead of buckle our belts, and if we dive in the muck of property, and the hogwash of fight, all these burning questions have but one possible answer, clear cut.<eos> See page 5.<eos> I tell you, Zalman, there will be no page 5!<eos> 4 pages is enough!<eos> - There will be no page 5!<eos> There will be a page 5!<eos> Down with page 5!<eos> - There will be no page 5!<eos> There will be a page 5!<eos> - There will not...

- He's Charlie 1?<eos> Yes, Sir Edward Matherson.<eos> He's the money.<eos> What's happened then?<eos> I'm guessing he's made a new deal with Ndofa.<eos> He doesn't need Limbani any more.<eos> He could've done that yesterday and aborted the mission then?<eos> This way he saves $500,000, the rest of our money.<eos> I'd like to meet him one day.<eos> Rafer, my friend, one day we will.
Be nice to Sanza.<eos> This is the order of the Shogun--<eos> "Tadanaga Tokugawa shall commit seppuku.<eos> Iemitsu."<eos> May I see it?<eos> I wonder what he was thinking when he signed it.<eos> He killed his father... now he kills his only brother.<eos> He must be unhappy.<eos> Tell him I pity him.<eos> I will, Prince.
Banks and Richards have both named you.<eos> You'll get three years for this, scum.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, sir.<eos> You bloody well will, toerag.<eos> I run this wing.<eos> And I'm not having it disrupted by a dirty little back-street villain like you.<eos> You'll sign a statement downstairs.<eos> I've got nothing to say, sir.<eos> I'd like to see the housemaster.<eos> You will, Carlin.

Maybe more of you than me.<eos> Besides it would've been silly in a big house like this near the airport...<eos> Why don't you give me a kiss..<eos> Where are you going on this trip?<eos> Oh. New York.<eos> We layover in Baltimore of all places. You're always flying off, just when I need you.<eos> Pigs!<eos> Pigs!<eos> You can't catch me!<eos> Oh yes, I will!
You can damn well believe that. Oh-Three and 12, return to base.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Notify civilian authorities... Let me ask you something.<eos> That little nipper that helped us out there-- that captain-- how much does he know about the overall plan?<eos> I think nothing.<eos> Well, he knows that other Jap, the one you met in Beirut.<eos> And he does know.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Anyway, he won't talk.<eos> He won't.
Help!<eos> Help! Help, somebody!<eos> I chose evil.<eos> Sharon, your hunger for belief was your truth.<eos> The time has come.<eos> Now we are saved and made strong.<eos> The enemy of the human race is subdued.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I understand now.<eos> The world won't.
Then I grabbed her like this!<eos> - Talk to the landlord.<eos> - What?<eos> Then I threw her again like this!<eos> - Distract him.<eos> - What for?<eos> She was tough, see, but I grabbed her in the old...<eos> - Keep him talking.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> You will.
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.<eos> I thought he might have meant old Ben.<eos> Do you know what he's talking about?<eos> I wonder if he's related to Ben.<eos> That wizard's just a crazy old man.<eos> Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.<eos> That'll be the end of it.<eos> It belongs to us now.<eos> But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?<eos> He won't.
We are what we are.<eos> Am I like you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Now, listen, shouldn't you call home?<eos> - I'd only wake Ethan.<eos> Emma, I've stayed at Yuri's a lot.<eos> Emilia, you continually surprise me.<eos> And me.<eos> I wish I knew who I was.<eos> - You will.
What is it?<eos> There's something I... I wanna say.<eos> Bru?<eos> What is it?<eos> Not until I tell you.<eos> I know this hasn't been easy for you and the kids.<eos> I want you to know<eos> I love you.<eos> Tell Charles thanks for the composition, please.<eos> I will.
If any of us makes it...<eos> Did I ever tell you the one about the guy who had a job giving enemas to elephants, and...?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Did you ever hear it?<eos> You can tell me about it when we get home.<eos> Tell Charles that... thank him for the composition, please.<eos> Well, tell him when I get back... I'm gonna take him to Yosemite again, like last summer.<eos> Right there.<eos> Run it again.<eos> I will.
Better to risk. Better to run towards a great holocaust that'll purify everything.<eos> And-- and what about Sara?<eos> And our son?<eos> Your son will be born in a little while... at St. Justin's clinic.<eos> St. Justin's.<eos> I'll have a brother.<eos> What will you do to him? Strangle him too?<eos> At the right moment.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> You will...
Grinds hard stones to meal;<eos> Slays king, ruins town,<eos> And beats high mountain down.<eos> Well, interesting.<eos> Yes, now, let me see.<eos> What is the answer?<eos> What is the answer?<eos> Just a moment now!<eos> My precious will it taste delicious?<eos> Yes! It will!
Take this.<eos> Read it some time.<eos> That is a collection of Sibylline verses rejected from the official book.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's prophesied there that you will one day be Emperor.<eos> Yes.<eos> You.<eos> Anything you say, Grandmother.<eos> - You won't forget your promise?<eos> - No, I won't.
- Do you have him?<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - And we'd like to put him away.<eos> - So would I.<eos> Because I don't think the damage he did to me will ever go away.<eos> Now when a man comes near me who I want to touch me, I still jump.<eos> Look we're gonna need your help to put him away.<eos> All he'd have to do is walk through that door, and I'd put him away.<eos> - I'd love it.<eos> - Will you...?
Okay, so the guy couldn't identify a suspect.<eos> Maybe he wasn't the right guy.<eos> Abby, we've got the right guy.<eos> Solkin's involved in those murders.<eos> Wanna know something?<eos> Here's Huggy.<eos> What?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want you to catch that crazy who's blowing up your car and putting rats in your refrigerator.<eos> HUTCH: We will, sweetheart.
While he's making his decision, I'll go to that pub and think about mine.<eos> The only time this plan makes any sense to me is when I'm drunk.<eos> - You are in command here?<eos> - Oberleutnant Koenig, Herr Oberst.<eos> These configurations seem somewhat abnormal for an E-boat.<eos> That's because she's a converted British MTB, Herr Oberst. Captured making a drop off the Dutch coast.<eos> You're familiar with the east coast of England?<eos> For five years I was First Mate on a cargo ship out of England.<eos> This could work, you know?<eos> It will.
We must be more patient than they.<eos> Hsiang... - Yes<eos> What do you think their next move will be?<eos> Their next move will be to wait for our next move<eos> Then we'll bury Chang and his daughter<eos> Sun Hsien, you'll conduct the funeral rite<eos> Tomorrow our men will pose as - coffin carriers, grave digger and monks, etc<eos> We must also find a place easily ambushed<eos> What if they didn't show up?<eos> - With your presence, they will
# Baby#<eos> # Dream awhile # # Scheme awhile # - Take it off!<eos> - Whoo! Whoo! # You're sure to find #<eos> # Happiness # # And I guess #<eos> - # All the things #<eos> # You've always pined for ##<eos> Mademoiselle, uh... does this brute - this beast bite?<eos> Does, uh, this bowwow... bite?<eos> Your dog, baby.<eos> - No, he won't.
I'll give you 10 minutes.<eos> You'll give us what time we need.<eos> Sam Burgade.<eos> Lord God, captain, I thought you was dead.<eos> Well, I ain't dead.<eos> I'm retired.<eos> - Sheriff? - Yo!<eos> Do you reckon they're in there?<eos> We ain't heard nothing from inside.<eos> You won't, neither.
I don't wanna hit you again.<eos> They're fucking your daughter!<eos> - Let me shoot.<eos> - What about Susan?<eos> I'll get closer.<eos> I won't miss.<eos> For the love of God.<eos> He didn't come.<eos> He should've.<eos> He will.
I won't miss.<eos> For the love of God.<eos> He didn't come.<eos> He should've.<eos> He will.<eos> If he doesn't come for her by sunrise, string her up to this tree.<eos> And when he sees her jerking on them ropes, he'll come.<eos> - He'll come.<eos> - What if he don't?<eos> He will.
Look, tomorrow is Sunday. Why don't you come to the studio.<eos> I'll show you around the studio.<eos> No, I wouldn't like to see the studio.<eos> You wouldn't?<eos> Monroe, we have that...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Look. Look, where would you like to go?<eos> I'm a weak woman.<eos> If I meet you tomorrow... will you leave me in peace?<eos> No, you won't, will you?
It's not just one of your holiday games.<eos> You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you that each cat's got three different names.<eos> See, they got their ordinary name and then they got their fancy name.<eos> And that makes two names, doesn't it?<eos> Now it's got a third name.<eos> Can either of you two guess what that third name is?<eos> Come on!<eos> Above and beyond there's one name that's left over and this is the name you never will guess.<eos> The name no human research can discover but the cat itself knows and never will confess.<eos> Will you, Henry?
- Laughing at me?<eos> - No!<eos> Gérard told us a good one.<eos> It's kinda gross.<eos> Tell it to Philippe.<eos> You'll love it.<eos> - No, not twice in a row.<eos> - Gérard!<eos> Say it again.<eos> - OK, I will.
No, thanks<eos> I need to go after I've had a word with you<eos> What do you want to say?<eos> Please tell me the truth. Little Yue<eos> I...<eos> I'm crippled<eos> Do you hate me because of it?<eos> We were good friends since we were little<eos> I hope you wouldn't refuse to marry me?<eos> Will you?
Got nowhere to go.<eos> Then you will die.<eos> I came here to die with you. Or live with you.<eos> Dying's not hard for you and me.<eos> It's living that's hard when all you ever cared about has been butchered or raped.<eos> Governments don't live together. People live together.<eos> Governments don't give you a fair word or a fair fight. I've come here to give you either one. Or get either one from you.<eos> I came here like this so you'll know my word of death is true. And that my word of life is then true.<eos> The bear lives here, the wolf, the antelope, the Comanche.<eos> And so will we.
Oh, it's so frightening!<eos> We're going to run into something!<eos> - Now on your own.<eos> - No, no, I won't!<eos> Do you want me to say who you are?<eos> Do you?<eos> You're a Bolshevik!<eos> You know what it means?<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - No, I won't.
He said:<eos> "Be fruitful and multiply."<eos> My dear, have you spellbound?<eos> . Come here close.<eos> Gennarino, "Went crazy or not? .<eos> Mother! .<eos> Gennarino, but how intended that this creature eats it? .<eos> Mom, I I'm not hungry.<eos> - Let's wash!<eos> . - No, I will! .
- I will take your laundry.<eos> - My laundry?<eos> - Why, Mrs. Maria?<eos> - To launder it.<eos> Why?<eos> Did I ask you to do so?<eos> - My goodness!<eos> - Wait, Mrs. Maria!<eos> - Don't come out!<eos> - I won't!
Been leading me, like a thread, throughout the world.<eos> Marousia?<eos> And the children?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> I'm going to tell everybody that you've stolen the book.<eos> - What?<eos> - I will, you'll see.<eos> - Now stop it!<eos> - Go on, tell everybody!<eos> I will, anyway!
- Wait, let's talk some more.<eos> - I can't. Have to go.<eos> I still need to drop my things at home on my way to work.<eos> You forgot your hat.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's my contribution.<eos> Afanasy, I wrote down my address for you.<eos> Drop by my place sometime.<eos> - Promise!<eos> - I will.
What do you mean?<eos> No, no...<eos> I don't want to disgrace myself.<eos> They are friends of my daughter.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Portions "A" and high season.<eos> Okay, captain.<eos> I will buy 2 kg of meat and 4 kg of fish.<eos> Bananas and...<eos> Sure you will.
I intend to see that Governor Fairchild stands trial for murder.<eos> Major Claremont.<eos> Deakin must have got to him.<eos> Where in God's name can they be?<eos> In the supply wagon.<eos> We've looked everywhere else.<eos> Find 'em and kill 'em. Both.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I want to see those rifles.<eos> - You will.
Director and animator Yuriy Norshtein<eos> In the evenings, the little hedgehog used to go to the little bear's to count the stars.<eos> They would sit on some logs, sipping tea, and gaze at the starry sky.<eos> It hung above the roof, just behind the chimney.<eos> To the right of the chimney were the bear's stars, and to the left - the hedgehog's.<eos> I'll tell him: I've brought you raspberry jam.<eos> And he'll say: The samovar has cooled down, we'd better throw those twigs on the fire... What are they called?<eos> Juniper twigs!<eos> And then I'll tell him... I'll tell him...<eos> I'll...
By some miracle, he managed to survive.<eos> In August 1951 Ishikawa's appeal was rejected.<eos> And he was returned to Fuchu Prison.<eos> Six years later... February 2, 1956<eos> "What a laugh!<eos> Thirty years of frenzy!"<eos> Ishikawa was a stereotype of the post-war gangster and even today he lives on in legend.<eos> Why did he write "humanity and justice" on his grave?<eos> To this day, no one knows.<eos> Nor ever will.
You know, I found my soul mate.<eos> Not only do I think I'm in love with her,<eos> - but I think I've found the right one.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, Deborah. It's only a couple of months, it could go south, but I don't think it will, because she's...<eos> Why would it?
I should probably go.<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you think it would've worked out between us if l-- lf we hadn't-- lf things had been different?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They never are, are they?<eos> No.<eos> I think in a way, that it's good, you know?<eos> I mean, maybe it's the only way that we could finally stand on our own.<eos> You know, to hurt each other so much that we have no choice but to let go.<eos> Maybe otherwise, we never would.
Thirty-two French.<eos> Please.<eos> My boys.<eos> Please, save my boys.<eos> Full trauma panel.<eos> Type and cross for 4, portable chest and pelvis.<eos> Another unit on the second line.<eos> Let's set up for a femoral.<eos> - We have blood?<eos> - We'd better.
You even made me feel safe.<eos> Ephram told me that you two guys talked.<eos> Yeah. We did.<eos> You didn't used to talk.<eos> Not like that anyway.<eos> You've changed you know.<eos> You have.<eos> This place you're doing good here aren't you?<eos> - Well I wouldn't say that.<eos> - I would.
That's a great movie!<eos> Listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything because you know, you'd be dead.<eos> But I was thinking about changing her name.<eos> I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.<eos> Emma.<eos> Emma? Ross wants you.<eos> Why does she keep making that noise?<eos> Honey, I don't know how to tell you this but if something were to happen to Ross or myself...<eos> -...you wouldn't get the baby.<eos> -Well, who would?
Hey, he was smart. He could fetch.<eos> I can fetch!<eos> He could dig up bones.<eos> Hello? Charlemagne?<eos> Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.<eos> Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.<eos> That's impossible!<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.<eos> No one ever asked if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house.<eos> Not that I would.
This was just a story in my head.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Do you have any idea How much this is going to be worth some day?<eos> Look. Story by michael novotny.<eos> Art by justin taylor.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> Hi.<eos> So, are you ready to sell your baby on the open market?<eos> I hope people like it.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
They use this place as a meditation hut... but it's been my safe-house more times than I care to remember.<eos> What fucking freaks.<eos> Yeah, at Ieast two of them aren't your parents.<eos> I'm their designated driver...every year.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's better than getting a call from the sheriff... saying your parents are laying in the bottom of Topanga Canyon... and would I Iike a ride in a helicopter.<eos> -We shouldn't be doing this.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because, you know, Iike... people are having, Iike, end-of-the-worId sex... and just, I didn't bring condoms....<eos> Like I would even anyway.
We have to stick together and save our energy to fight Kroehner.<eos> -You know, Stan?<eos> -Yes. I Iove this guy.<eos> Terrific!<eos> I don't know, Gary.<eos> Twice in one day?<eos> claire, this is Detective Reese.<eos> Why don't you sit down, claire?<eos> Any idea where gabriel Dimas is?<eos> -Why would I?
Yeah, you know?<eos> You know, like when we go out and we, like, we hit on a hot chick and then she turns us down and then we try to, like, grab her, like, uglier friends, you know?<eos> Well, we're, like, his uglier friends and he's, like, the hot chick.<eos> They'll settle for us. Dude, I...<eos> I'm ok with being settled for. Yeah!<eos> He could be your ally. You gotta get him to let you use his airspace.<eos> Yeah. Ok.<eos> That's a good idea, all right?<eos> But don't crotch block me this time, ok?<eos> What? I would...
Perhaps we should take a dirty bath together<eos> Take it easy, sleazy<eos> I only came here to give you your key back<eos> I am a married woman<eos> Sure, my husband is an enormous bulldozer of a man who has to be hit with a stun gun before he can be weighed or medicated<eos> But when I said "I do" to Stan Walker and his attorneys...<eos> I meant that to be forever<eos> I admire your integrity<eos> Would you care to step inside take your clothes off and discuss it further?<eos> I would indeed!
So fix it for that day.<eos> That's good. I am sorry. But... the wedding is with whom?<eos> With whom?<eos> I think it was all decided last night!<eos> Jamayang came to see me and requested to come here and decide the wedding date of Pema and Tashi.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Jamayang?<eos> Even if the decision was in my favor... you wouldn't have married me, anyway!<eos> Would you?
Come to a gangbang without rubbers!<eos> What a bunch of dickheads!<eos> We can't bunghole him without protection.<eos> We don't know the guy.<eos> Then what do we do to him?<eos> - Don't feel obliged to... - shut the fuck up!<eos> What can I say?<eos> If we can't bust his ass, we bust his face.<eos> I'd prefer that.<eos> Oh, would you?
- On a Sunday?<eos> - The meeting's first thing tomorrow.<eos> I've got to work on some figures.<eos> We could just pop into the party...<eos> - for a minute and leave early.<eos> - I'm sorry. I just can't do it.<eos> I've got to head back.<eos> Listen, if you've changed your mind, you could just say so.<eos> Because, honestly, I don't see what could be so important.<eos> No, well, you wouldn't, would you?
Dude!<eos> You live next door to the bubble boy.<eos> Know what I heard?<eos> The only thing he can drink is his own urine.<eos> True story.<eos> Swear to God.<eos> I heard the same thing, man.<eos> It's gross.<eos> Then what did he drink to make the urine?<eos> Well, it would...
And uyour own opinion.<eos> We would like that, too.<eos> Lammers has indeed met with the Fhrer or his staff on this question and reached an understanding.<eos> Dr. Kritzinger, can we come to a further understanding here?<eos> What can we all agree on?<eos> What I would like agreed here is that mixed- blood persons of the first degree theuy have two Jewish grandparents, theuy are half - Jews theuy are just Jews.<eos> Theuy go.<eos> Their children go.<eos> There are, in the law, as of now, two exceptions.<eos> If uyou would...
I told you. I don't like pancakes.<eos> -So?<eos> Your dad said to watch you.<eos> -That's just what we're doing.<eos> Stop looking at us and eat up, scout.<eos> It's possible it was an accident.<eos> I mean, animals could've eaten her face off, right?<eos> It looks like her face was just skinned.<eos> -Did Ed Turner see anything?<eos> -Why would he?
It's just a routine control.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> How did it go?<eos> I got an extension, but I don't have much time left.<eos> They suspect me.<eos> Go to bed. The fight's tomorrow.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - I'll go when I feel like it.<eos> Come now, or I'll slug you.<eos> You'd better not.
- Mads, let's have one more child.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - We've got two already.<eos> - I think it would be good for me.<eos> - I've got to get to work.<eos> - That business dinner ...<eos> - For the contractors?<eos> I'd like to do it for you.<eos> I really would.
Of course, only prettier.<eos> Really?<eos> I am prettier?<eos> No you were the ugliest!<eos> Can you take a picture of us?<eos> Sure.<eos> Smile.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Would you like me to take one of you?<eos> If you would!
- Really?<eos> - I swear.<eos> And if he operated 3 times, 3 times.<eos> They call the doctor "the gardener".<eos> Because he works with plants.<eos> Terminal cases.<eos> When we don't know what to do with someone... we send them to him to see what he invents.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> What he'd like is to see all his patients alive.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.<eos> I want more of this.<eos> More 1876.<eos> But, Kate, you don't work on Sundays.<eos> We can have more.<eos> Well, oh, no, 'cause Sunday is the day before the day I work, so... it gets poisoned.<eos> I see.<eos> Besides, tomorrow is the day we shoot your commercial. Kate.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Would you...?
I think you know this.<eos> What?<eos> Sing with us, John.<eos> They love that trick.<eos> I knew it was coming.<eos> I meant to do it.<eos> Recess! Recess! Lucky!<eos> - When will we see Mr. Bo again?<eos> - Would you like to see him again?<eos> Yeah, we all would.
On there you are<eos> Mona's car is in the driveway. It looks clean.<eos> Tow it to CSI and process the rooms in the pool house where Mona worked last night.<eos> And you will be...?<eos> I'll be with Lady Heather.<eos> Does all this fascinate you?<eos> Yes. I find all deviant behaviour fascinating in that to understand our human nature we have to understand our aberrations.<eos> And you think what goes on here is aberrant?<eos> I would say that whip marks and ligature contusions on a young woman are aberrant.<eos> Wouldn't you?
- On what?<eos> Scans I took this afternoon.<eos> Find anything you wanna tell me about?<eos> There's nothing of scientific interest on this planet.<eos> Our mission here was a waste of time.<eos> That's what you'd like us to think.<eos> - Let me see that thing.<eos> - The readings are in Vulcan.<eos> - You won't understand them.<eos> - No. But Hoshi would.
- Yes, I want the interview.<eos> - Good.<eos> Get me something more than his favorite color, okay?<eos> Maybe I should make grilled cheese.<eos> But you're making pot roast.<eos> Not everybody likes pot roast.<eos> Then they can have chicken wings, the mashed potatoes, the four salads... in addition to the pot roast.<eos> Yeah, I guess you're right.<eos> So I should start slicing the cheese.<eos> Would you?
That's how our arguments go.<eos> No, not always, but this time, you betcha.<eos> All right, you're right.<eos> You know what?<eos> I saved myself, but you know what, it's instinct, ok?<eos> This is the way people are.<eos> Doug, no. I'm sorry.<eos> It's the way you are, ok?<eos> There are some people that would risk their lives for someone they loved.<eos> Oh, would they?
-He was a Soviet spy.<eos> -Based on what?<eos> Cables intercepted by U S. Army Signal Intelligence in the 1 940s.<eos> Why couldn't the U S. attorney make espionage in the 1 950s?<eos> The cables weren't decrypted until the 1 970s.<eos> We cracked some obscure Russian code and learned Gault was a spy?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -That's crap.<eos> If the FBI had proof on Gault, they'd have told the world.<eos> No, they wouldn't. Neither would the NSA or Central Intelligence.
What's good to eat here?<eos> Lil, you didn't come here to eat.<eos> What do you want?<eos> 'Kay.<eos> I just wanted to let you know you can come back to the bar whenever you want.<eos> - I appreciate the offer, but I'm okay here.<eos> - I figured that.<eos> You were never a lifer.<eos> I'm married to that bar.<eos> Hell, I'd, uh--
How do you know that?<eos> I buried her.<eos> It's important for you to go out and get some fresh air.<eos> Twice a day.<eos> We're all a bit tense at the moment.<eos> Yes sir, boss!<eos> And we have to talk about our problems.<eos> I specifically asked Sissi to join us again today.<eos> Would anyone like to comment on this topic?<eos> Yes, I would...
I go places, and I forget why I'm there.<eos> I miss exits on the freeway.<eos> I'm lucky to... find my way home from the grocery store.<eos> And if I do, then... most of the time I've forgotten my groceries.<eos> But yet, you make it here every week.<eos> Twice a week.<eos> Yeah. You do.<eos> What if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter ? Would you really want me to be the one looking for her ?<eos> Yes...<eos> I would.
Why don't we.<eos> Keys were hanging out the door, Howard.<eos> - Not too racy?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Marie.<eos> - What?<eos> - Would you like to dance?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> No.<eos> Would you?
Then what is it?<eos> I'm preparing him for the world out there.<eos> - Yeah, but--<eos> - Look, it's insurance.<eos> These kids are gonna eat him alive.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Tiny, it is true.<eos> What if he doesn't want to box?<eos> Sure, he wants to.<eos> What kid wouldn't?
I just dropped my pen.<eos> I'm all thumbs today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you cut that out?<eos> It's driving me crazy.<eos> Excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts.<eos> It's only psychological.<eos> Your neck doesn't really hurt.<eos> You'd know better about that?<eos> Yes, he would.
Of course, Lenka's husband.<eos> She's looking for you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Look at all the junk Mom had.<eos> It's that psychopath again.<eos> He keeps following me around.<eos> -Then we'll get him stoned.<eos> -He doesn't smoke.<eos> -Does he eat?<eos> -Why wouldn't he?
She may have been a great singer, but she was a lousy human being.<eos> Callous.<eos> You take after her.<eos> - I've no clean clothes.<eos> - I put some in your cupboard.<eos> Don't forget the rum truffles.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - What is it this time?<eos> If it's all right, I'd like a change now and then.<eos> - So would I.
No, tomorrow I'm not recording.<eos> You and Schumann are such good company.<eos> This is my first concert in ages.<eos> - One drops so many things.<eos> - Tennis, for example.<eos> - Then I could beat you now.<eos> - Very probably.<eos> You mean it?<eos> Would you dare?<eos> I would.
Actually, my research backs Riley up.<eos> Drac isn't the lay-low type.<eos> So we can check out the nicer places.<eos> Don't you think, Buffy?<eos> Buffy?<eos> Yeah. We'll check all the swanky places first.<eos> What else did you guys get?<eos> Well, Willow has most of it, actually.<eos> Only because you gave me super pointers.<eos> - l would never...
- This is so not happening.<eos> Listen to me, Piper.<eos> I told you, I thought this whole thing through.<eos> Is that why you asked me to marry you in a toilet?<eos> I tried to get you downstairs.<eos> Well, I'm downstairs now, and I still don't believe you're serious.<eos> I am serious, Piper. Dead serious.<eos> Right.<eos> Dead is exactly what we're gonna be if they ever find out.<eos> Piper, would you?
There was a sergeant on our force, a regular guy, just like you and me, who had no idea he was that way until his trip to Hawaii.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What happened?<eos> A guy rented him a boogie board, and a bell went off.<eos> Today, they run a gift shop on Maui.<eos> So what-- what are you saying?<eos> We just haven't met Mr. Right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Debra and I were talking about going to Hawaii.<eos> I wouldn't.
Your species would kept me well fed for a long time<eos> You see?<eos> Everyone has a panic button just waiting to be pushed!<eos> Even the Luxan!<eos> Your son, Jothee<eos> How old is he?<eos> I can't wait to run across him.<eos> Didn't you tell him John, hat that sort of thing doesn't work?<eos> How would you like a free trip home or your planet?<eos> You wouldn't?
- Max, I don't belong there.<eos> I don't belong there. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere.<eos> - Michael, we understand why you...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Isabel, you don't understand.<eos> - So you got a raw deal. No one's saying you didn't.<eos> God, Michael, you finally have a chance to change it.<eos> Would it kill you to ask for help just once in your life? Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> It would.
Wait till you see the hot tub.<eos> - We should check out the hot tub.<eos> - Okey-dokey.<eos> I'll have the omelet with no cheese, but tomatoes and mushrooms.<eos> Instead of the fries a side of fruit with no grapes, and a half decaf skim.<eos> You should get the mushrooms steamed.<eos> It lightens the calories but retains the flavor.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> - I really like LA.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
It just got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons why we were together.<eos> And you and love?<eos> Oh, well, there's a question without an interesting answer.<eos> I have thought about you.<eos> It's just that any time I've tried to keep anything normal with a person that was normal, it's just been a disaster.<eos> Yeah, no, listen, I appreciate that, absolutely.<eos> So what is that, a film you're doing?<eos> I start in LA on Tuesday.<eos> Would you like me to take you through your lines?<eos> Would you?
Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop.<eos> Think of Sebastian as a tutor.<eos> Let him instruct you.<eos> But I don't love him.<eos> I love Ronald.<eos> Don't you want to make Ronald happy?<eos> Practice makes perfect, Cecile.<eos> My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.<eos> That would make me a slut...<eos> Wouldn't it?
I want to see that.<eos> Do you mind if I stay?<eos> I won't bother you.<eos> No, you can't, you can't...<eos> - or they won't come!<eos> - Why not?<eos> I have to be alone.<eos> They won't come.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Why would they?
Two queens.<eos> The beds, not us.<eos> I bought some roses and went crawling back to my wife.... but you hit the mini bar and got wasted.<eos> - You don't want me to move in?<eos> - Of course, I want you to move in.<eos> Then what is this pre- prenuptial agreement all about?<eos> It just says if we ever break up, you can't sue me.<eos> Why would I sue you?<eos> And why would we break up?<eos> We wouldn't, honey.
Well, strictly speaking I'm an amateur - but I'm bloody keen.<eos> Keen as mustard.<eos> - I'm having trouble with my zip.<eos> - Your zip?<eos> Could you undo it?<eos> Pardon?<eos> No, I still don't understand.<eos> You want me to undo your zip?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Would you?
I honestly don't know.<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> Would you?<eos> - I'm sorry, forget it.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace more quiet.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to stay here.<eos> Right.<eos> - I would....
Well, since I don't have any powers to show Mom, I think it should be you two.<eos> And I'll just stand outside and watch for Nicholas.<eos> That doesn't seem fair to you, Phoebe, not being able to see Mom.<eos> I know, it's not. But I got over that a long time ago.<eos> I don't need to see her now.<eos> Really, it's okay.<eos> We better get going, though, before we miss her.<eos> Scary.<eos> Buddy's has not changed a bit.<eos> Wouldn't?
That's great!<eos> I'll be there Monday.<eos> And thank you again.<eos> That was the head of the paleontology department... at N...<eos> Y...<eos> U.<eos> What... did he... say?<eos> Remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate?<eos> -They loved it.<eos> -Well, who wouldn't?
We don't charge.<eos> We're set up principally for those who can't pay.<eos> Joseph and I talked.<eos> He's accepted his fate.<eos> But there seems to be a great deal of psychic pain.<eos> - I guess he wants to--<eos> - Father Genaro, I haven't seen my father since I was 17.<eos> We were estranged.<eos> Yes, that's been confirmed by him.<eos> But I would...
Who are you?<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> He'll listen to me.<eos> He'll pay it. I know he will!<eos> I don't want money.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> About what he does, about the people he works with.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You wouldn't believe it unless you heard it from his mouth.<eos> No one would.
You have a beautiful family.<eos> Yes? I wasn't running.<eos> You're telling me he's not one of yours?<eos> No, I understand. I said I understand.<eos> Di- Please tell me what's going on.<eos> Rock Creek Park, 10:00 a.m.<eos> Oh, yes, I will.<eos> - [Sighs] What's your name?<eos> - Jarod. - Turn around, Jarod.<eos> - I'd really rather not.
How the fuck could you...?<eos> You took their money?<eos> Good, then do it.<eos> I don't give a fuck anymore.<eos> That restaurant was like my child.<eos> So they got in your ear. Three generations of Buccos sweated over that same stove.<eos> Even your mother treasures the memory of Vesuvio.<eos> My mother?<eos> Don't say she's lying, Tone.<eos> Because why would she?
And you know what? Sometimes I don't like the way she goes about it. But I've come to understand her.<eos> Amarice, you're so young.<eos> And when you're young ya think the answers are simple to find. You think you're gonna find them on the point of a sword?<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> I just pray that you live long enough to lay down your sword and look for those answers in yourself.<eos> Well, I still think she's wrong, but if you trust her...<eos> Sorry, I can't go there. You'll just have to trust her on your own.<eos> I hope that you can follow orders.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> In my tribe, we would...
Sorry, Leeanne, this is real important.<eos> I promise, if it wasn't an emergency, I wouldn't do it.<eos> Come on, you know Clyde, the kids are comfortable with him.<eos> I just don't like him. Never have.<eos> The guy hung around here for an hour.<eos> He was flirtin' with me too. - Well... - I don't trust him.<eos> He did me a favour dropping' off the kids, and he's gone now, so let it go.<eos> I don't want that drunk hangin' round my children.<eos> Would you mind if I call you later?<eos> As a matter of fact, I would.
I could be the hostess and receive the guests... and make sure their towels are clean.<eos> And I can do all the cooking.<eos> I'm a great cook.<eos> You could be the handyman.<eos> Do the plumbing and carpentry.<eos> - But it costs money.<eos> - Hardly any.<eos> She wouldn't run away.<eos> On our wedding night?<eos> Yes, she would.
- Come on. We're late.<eos> - It's absolutely disgraceful.<eos> Your Honor, could we finish early today?<eos> I have to draw me dole.<eos> So, afraid for your life, you handed over the money?<eos> Objectlon. Leadlng the witness.<eos> - Sustalned.<eos> - I'll rephrase that.<eos> With this gun pointing at your head... why did you give them the money?<eos> - Well, wouldn't you?
The Attorney General herself just called in 25 dimes on the Cubs.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah?<eos> This is 13.<eos> Cubs ten times.<eos> Got it.<eos> Dumb bet, 13.<eos> Cubs are in a slump.<eos> Would you mind if I told you something personal?<eos> Yeah, I would, Roger.
Keep it close.<eos> I'll be 20 minutes.<eos> We'll keep it up top.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks, Raoul.<eos> If I come a-knocking a-knocking at your door<eos> ...on this October day<eos> Would you say, "It'd be a joy<eos> With you, my good boy"<eos> 'Cause if you would...
I'll see you around...<eos> Patch.<eos> Rudy, stop.<eos> You're throwing off my rhythm.<eos> You'll go blind.<eos> -Please.<eos> -I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> Then go.<eos> It's right over there, 15 feet away.<eos> -I would, but- -But what?
Of course<eos> A personality like you, there're still lots of things remain unclear, how could you kill me?<eos> Why me?<eos> Mr Hung chose you, about a month ago<eos> What do you get by setting me up?<eos> I'm not a good cop,just pay me and everything would be alright<eos> Why the hell did you do all these?<eos> If not, how could you be convinced of Mr Hung's power?<eos> You just think he's an idiot<eos> But after tonight, you wouldn't anymore
Tomorrow.<eos> You okay? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's why I like to practice my walking.<eos> Good night.<eos> ALLY: Why do I have to always fall down?<eos> - I saw you!<eos> - Not your business.<eos> Everything is my business when it comes to relationships!<eos> - Go have your own.<eos> - I would if I...
Hey, Frank. Hi, Debra.<eos> What a very nice outfit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look. My nails match. I had them done.<eos> -I noticed.<eos> -Oh, yes. See, Ray?<eos> It was worth the money. Oh, listen. Can you give me some cash?<eos> -I have to pick up Ally at ballet class.<eos> You know, I don't even think I have cash on me.<eos> -Dad, you wouldn't....
- We got no one.<eos> We need a new format.<eos> We should shut down and retool.<eos> - What about a guest host?<eos> - I'll pretend I didn't hear that.<eos> - Doctor, how's the squirrel?<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> No, fortunately the special tiny instruments arrived just in time.<eos> - Would you like to visit him?<eos> - Yes, he would.
Hey, quit it.<eos> They like Itchy, they like Scratchy.<eos> One kid seems to love the Speedo man.<eos> What more do they want?<eos> Okay, how many of you would like Itchy Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day?<eos> - I would!<eos> - Great idea! Yeah, that's it.<eos> And who would like to see them do just the opposite getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?<eos> - Me!<eos> I would. - Cool.
I must prepare.<eos> Of course.<eos> May glory and honor follow you on your journey.<eos> Ah... excuse me, sirs?<eos> Could I just slip by?<eos> How is the shoulder?<eos> Oh, Dr. Bashir made the necessary repairs.<eos> I told him it was a holosuite accident.<eos> He would not understand the need to draw blood in a warrior's training exercise.<eos> Few humans would.
- Where? She took a train.<eos> - No, she's too smart for that.<eos> Don't you see? She just meant to throw them off.<eos> She said she wanted to go public.<eos> The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station.<eos> Susanne!<eos> John.<eos> They didn't believe my story.<eos> Not a word of it.<eos> Who in their right mind would?
Didn't know they would be.<eos> Anti-wrinkle cream.<eos> Can fellas use this an' all?<eos> Do you mind, you!<eos> Well, I just pray they're a bit more understanding about us, that's all.<eos> You what?<eos> They're gonna be looking at us like that.<eos> What if, next Friday, 400 women say:<eos> "He's too fat, he's too old, and he's a pigeon-chested little tosser."<eos> - They wouldn't. - Why not?
Well, let's see what our London experts say first, shall we?<eos> If it passes muster with them, you'll be paid in full. Cash on delivery.<eos> Of a Rembrandt.<eos> But I don't have a Rembrandt yet, do I? Because I don't have a signature... so until somebody tells me otherwise...<eos> I have a bloody Díaz de la Peña, don't I?<eos> Oh, that's really good.<eos> Are you still teaching a course there? Oh, yes.<eos> It's unsigned, but I think it might be... an early, uncataloged Díaz de la Peña.<eos> Yes, an uncataloged de la Peña would be wonderful.<eos> Wouldn't it?
I don't want to!<eos> Don't oppose, my son!<eos> I'm not hungry, I don't want to eat!<eos> János, you can't raise your father from the dead by starving.<eos> I don't want to hear them saying at school, that Mrs. Witman cannot even give her sons proper food.<eos> Son.<eos> Son!<eos> Mom did not cry at all.<eos> If we died would she cry for us?<eos> She would.
I don't want him up there again.<eos> End it, commander.<eos> End it now.<eos> A father protects his son.<eos> The most basic of human instincts.<eos> A biological imperative.<eos> Those of you who are parents know you don't have to be a Navy SEAL to act on the impulse.<eos> And though Chief Bauwer didn't know his son, he stood watch every day across from that convenience store to check on his well-being.<eos> And when three violent criminals threatened the boy's life, he didn't hesitate.<eos> Would you?
The proof is going to show that this defendant was an accomplice to Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin in the commission of these horrifying murders and we will ask you to return your verdict of guilty on three counts of capital murder.<eos> ( Woman ) We don't know what the truth is but when it really gets down to it...<eos> His daddy and I are gonna look him scare in the eyes and say, son, did you do this ?<eos> Was you even there ? That's when we will believe.<eos> If he told me he did it... Which I don't believe he did, but if he told me he did it... He'd have to do his time.<eos> Suffer the consequences.<eos> ( Lee ) If he admits to this, he would be strictly on his own.<eos> We wouldn't even send him a dollar for a pack of cigarettes.<eos> No, you're wrong there.<eos> Yes, we would.
All right, that's it!<eos> Come on, we're going back.<eos> It's past your bedtimes.<eos> - Please, can we go to one more floor?<eos> - Yeah, one more floor!<eos> - Be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Yeah, be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Nurse "Ba-jerk" would let us.<eos> - Bjerke.<eos> And, yes, I would.
So I took that as an indication.<eos> Look. I'm not into forcing anybody.<eos> You didn't force her?<eos> - What's this? - That's what you did to Farrell McLeary.<eos> I didn't do this.<eos> - She must have taken a fall or somethin'.<eos> No. No, no. She told me about this.<eos> She takes, um, uh, gymnastics class at the- at the Y"... and she told me she banged herself up working out.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Would you, please?
-Where? -Up the hill.<eos> Good God, no, no, no.<eos> I'll stay here if you don't mind.<eos> Lots of paperwork. Scads to catch up on and such.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> All right.<eos> Say, you don't want me to open up a window or anything?<eos> I'm not sure that I can rely on Mr. Garrad.<eos> But the thing is I will need an assistant. I...<eos> -You wouldn't...
I oheated on my husband.<eos> I didn't know I'd be arrested.<eos> You're not under arrest.<eos> You never oalled yourself Jade or used Medford's house?<eos> Look bring that girl in here.<eos> She'll tell you I'm not that person.<eos> The girl is dead.<eos> Exouse me.<eos> Would it surprise you to know that Medford owned the Paoifioa house?<eos> Yes it would.
He didn't.<eos> Ivanova to Sheridan.<eos> Sheridan here.<eos> Captain, have I got something for you.<eos> - You sure you don't want me to wait? - No, it's fine.<eos> I'll take care of the paperwork.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I believe I am expected.<eos> I don't suppose you'd mind telling me why you were on a Vorlon transport.<eos> I would, actually.
Developed by one of the top vascular surgeons in the country.<eos> He works here.<eos> Newer's better?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> But....<eos> You'd go with the new thing?<eos> I would.<eos> You would. Okay.
- Tonight.<eos> - What are the odds of that happening?<eos> You take your time.<eos> There it is!<eos> - What'll you do?<eos> - What can I do?<eos> I don't wanna screw it up with Ursula.<eos> And your friend?<eos> If she's my friend, she'll understand.<eos> Wouldn't you?
Well, I like to think it's a little more than that, Annie.<eos> It's not.<eos> Listen, Annie.<eos> I'm heading up the investigation.<eos> I'm surprised they're letting you.<eos> I mean, you and Lucas being such good friends and all.<eos> I don't think they know.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, you know, Lucas wouldn't want you to get yourself in any trouble on his account.<eos> Yes, he would.
But listen, Frank, if you did it... - I know you didn't mean to.<eos> - I wouldn't hurtJenny.<eos> I would've tried to protect her. I tried. I tried!<eos> I tried when I woke up!<eos> Frank, no one was in that apartment but you.<eos> Did you hurt your sister, without meaning to, with losing your temper and all?<eos> - I would never hurtJenny.<eos> - Somebody took a knife and killed her.<eos> - Where's the weapon, Frank?<eos> I would wantJenny alive.
I had it all:<eos> A woman Alison, friends, an exciting job ... and in a moment, I took everything.<eos> All because of a photo.<eos> I am negative.<eos> They are desperate to get it.<eos> I want this newspaper to prove that these events are real.<eos> I know they are.<eos> It is not possible otherwise.<eos> I see my life as a puzzle which would be missing parts<eos> Some elements that would the past, very ephemeral.
- How did you meet Thomas, anyway?<eos> - Through my sister.<eos> She used to travel around with these rock'n'roll bands, I left home and joined her.<eos> - You were a groupie?<eos> - Yes, and then my sister died of an overdose. And the band threw me out the bus in the middle of the nowhere...<eos> That's when I met Thomas, and he got me into the movie thing.<eos> - You were 12 years old then?<eos> - Almost 13.<eos> There were good pornographers there for a while. At least I thought so.<eos> They'd offices in London, Amsterdam, in Miami...
Nobody's gonna hand it to you on a plate.<eos> When I was a young boy... my granddaddy, who had been a professional bounty hunter, he said to me, "Watty only two things you need in life to get by on this planet.<eos> Love and a 45."<eos> Well howdy, young lady.<eos> What is a fine looking young woman such as yourself doing on one these dangerous, deserted, back country Texas roads?<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Did you get us some grocery money?<eos> I just might have.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to join me in my chariot for a little romp in the moonlight?<eos> Perhaps I would.
You know, Rex and Partner, that big European agency...<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, they offered me a job.<eos> That's good.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> 12... 13...<eos> Your plastic is annoying.<eos> - I have to lose 3 kg.<eos> - You'd better.
- Just checking.<eos> Could you roll me one of those, cowboy?<eos> - You can have this one, cowgirl!<eos> Think nothing of it,<eos> Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.<eos> - How long were you there?<eos> - Just over three years.<eos> - I go there once a year to chill out for a month.<eos> - I didn`t know that.<eos> Why would you?
- Well, that's the first thing in our favor.<eos> - What's that? With a name like Booger, it shouldn't be too hard to get dirt on him.<eos> Good night, Mr. Ogre.<eos> Good night, Trevor.<eos> - Hmm? - Why can't we videotape the birth?<eos> I just don't want the whole world to see my privates.<eos> But I've already bought a high-definition... Dolby stereo, 3-D helmet cam.<eos> You know you'll show the video to someone.<eos> I'm really surprised at you, Betty. Not having the confidence to think that I wouldn't show the video to someone.<eos> Maybe I would.
There's nothing for me over there now.<eos> - Closing the park! - Could you lend us a few shillings?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same.<eos> - Gerry, we've no money left. - It's all I have.<eos> Well, now, like I wouldn't like to take all your money.<eos> No problem. Catch you again, Charlie.<eos> - Come on. It's not even 8:00 yet. - All right, all right.<eos> We must'vejust said good night to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.<eos> All we were concerned about was where we were gonna sleep that night.<eos> We'd no money in our pockets.
Three months in which to get ajob, keep it and create a suitable home.<eos> If this proves to be a possibility for you, I will consider ajoint-custody arrangement when we reconvene. We're adjourned.<eos> Well, it looks like there is a little light at the end of our tunnel.<eos> - That's all my stuff.<eos> - This is all my fault.<eos> God, no.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> I should have never had a birthday, Dad.<eos> - This never would have happened.<eos> - Yes, it would.
- The big boy's gonna wash himself. - Right.<eos> - I gotta go. - Okay.<eos> - You missed it.<eos> - What did I miss?<eos> - The sunset.<eos> - Really?<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I'd like to see where you live.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
You don't sound very sure.<eos> Is your ethical program functioning?<eos> Data?<eos> Do you have a friend?<eos> Yes.<eos> His name is Geordi.<eos> If it meant that you could feel emotions again, the way you did on Ohniaka III, would you kill your friend?<eos> Would you kill Geordi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
- I'm just not ready yet.<eos> - Registered.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I mean, hey, we got all night, right?<eos> Joey, welcome.<eos> 'You have to help me.'<eos> What a bitch.<eos> She was obviously just using you.<eos> - She was ready to dump you...<eos> She wouldn't.
- Chantelle?<eos> Sure.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Happy?<eos> Well, happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, she seems okay.<eos> She lives upstairs.<eos> I don't know if she's happy.<eos> No reason you would.
Never mind about all that now.<eos> Did you just say yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Er...<eos> Natasha do you believe in sex before marriage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you...<eos> Would you practise it?<eos> Yes, I would.
Now, how many people on your ship?<eos> 1014.<eos> Very hazardous, Commander.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm the classroom computer.<eos> What can I do for you today?<eos> Computer, display interior security grid.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't do that.<eos> - Would you like to play a game?<eos> - No, I would not.
I don't want to have to play games and flirt and all that shit any more.<eos> What I'm trying to say is...<eos> you're a good guy.<eos> Your politics are screwed up, you're not a great writer, but you're not a psycho and you're cute, in a way.<eos> Don't you ever get lonely?<eos> I know you have a lot of women, but don't you just get lonely anyway?<eos> And scared?<eos> Like your whole life is going by, and your days and your nights.<eos> Nobody's around to see it, except you.<eos> I would just...
There we are!<eos> You know who she is?<eos> Your grandma would.
He was just working his plate.<eos> I'm sorry, Julie.<eos> Night, baby.<eos> I said to this guy, "What are you, some kind of idiot?"<eos> I did! I said, "File a schedule C."<eos> That's right!<eos> You would, huh?<eos> - Would what?<eos> - File a schedule C?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- Mattie Storin.<eos> I... I thought you were a man.<eos> Well, sorry.<eos> Could I speak to Roger?<eos> No, he's not in this morning.<eos> He called in sick.<eos> Look, can you come over now?<eos> Um...yes, if you think it's worth my while.<eos> I would rather speak to Mr O'Neill.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Don't you understand?<eos> It all became unreal.<eos> It wasn't happening to me.<eos> All I could feel was fear.<eos> I was afraid of them.<eos> I was terrified!<eos> Not because they were black, but because of who they were.<eos> I didn't mean to kill him.<eos> I couldn't make it stop.<eos> They wouldn't- it wouldn't...
And you call yourselves sluts.<eos> Alrighty.<eos> Now we're going to ask you girls to do some things in this video that may not seem humanly possible.<eos> So I'd like to start by having a little pre- audition audition.<eos> So, miss would this offend you?<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> - Next.<eos> - Damn.<eos> My dear, would you be offended if perhaps you were asked to...?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
What?<eos> - That's...?<eos> - Hi-yo-hi-yo-ip-se-ni-yo.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> I got some for me, in case I came down with the flu, which I haven't.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I noticed that.<eos> Would you like me to rub this all over you?<eos> Yeah, that would be...<eos> You would?
The Captain wants you to scan the orders and be ready to brief him in ten minutes.<eos> Right?<eos> - Number One.<eos> - Riker here.<eos> Meet Cmdr Data on the bridge.<eos> He has our new orders.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> And assemble the bridge staff for a briefing in 1 5 minutes.<eos> Picard out.<eos> - Mr Elbrun, would you...
– Charlie.<eos> – Yeah, Jess, I...<eos> – I thought you were meant to be watching him.<eos> Well, no, of course, I was watching...<eos> What is going on?<eos> What's he been up to? Now, look.<eos> I barely had a chance to get my little book on the guy started. I don't need the full rundown.<eos> It's not a full rundown. What have you got on him now that I can use? Jess, take it easy.<eos> I'm sure I'll have more on him later.<eos> Well, you'd better.
You got a suspect?<eos> It's a little early to be sure, sir.<eos> But you do have some clues?<eos> Little things here and there...<eos> Hypothetical? Circumstantial?<eos> – Yes and no, sir.<eos> – No proof?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> I'd hate to think that there was any suspicion or innuendo attached to me.<eos> So would I, sir.
Oh, right, yes, right.<eos> Um, yes.<eos> I'd like to call my first witness, Captain Darling.<eos> You wish to call the counsel for the prosecution as a defence witness?<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't worry, sir, I've got it all under control. Ahem.<eos> You are Captain Darling of the general staff?<eos> I am.<eos> Captain, leaving aside the incident in question, would you think of Captain Blackadder as the sort of man who would usually ignore orders?<eos> Yes, I would.
There is a lot of Gypsies around here, apparently, and Mr. Reedburn wasn't exactly a favorite of theirs.<eos> He tried to have them moved on, several times.<eos> What was the cause of the death, would you say?<eos> A blow to the back of the head.<eos> There was also a bruising between the eyes, but the fatal injury was to the head.<eos> You can still see the blood.<eos> - So, he was lying on his back?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Perhaps he fell back against this?<eos> There would blood traces on that arm.
What should I say?<eos> How do I act? What do I do?<eos> Guinan, I need your help.<eos> Step over here.<eos> Sounds simple enough.<eos> Now, first words are important.<eos> You may want to start like this.<eos> You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy.<eos> But that might not work.<eos> Yes. It would.
And I... am older than you could ever imagine.<eos> What should I say?<eos> How do I act? What do I do?<eos> Guinan, could you step over here?<eos> Sounds simple enough.<eos> Your first words are the most important.<eos> You may want to start like this.<eos> You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy.<eos> But that might not work.<eos> Yes, it would.
Candour seems to be a trait he admires.<eos> Honesty is the trait he admires most.<eos> You should honestly consider why you're so competitive with your own son.<eos> Competitive?<eos> Maybe in the past.<eos> But I'm here to help Will prepare for his first task as Captain.<eos> Will he accept such a dangerous assignment?<eos> He'll accept it because it is dangerous.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> - Because I would.
Look, I know this is gonna sound bizarre, But is there anything the killer said That indicates he might look like you?<eos> Is that what he said?<eos> Yeah, swears the guy Could be your twin brother.<eos> Well, you can assure him, sergeant, That I only have a sister.<eos> Okay, sorry to bother you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Uh, thanks for all your help.<eos> Um... Any other thoughts come to mind, You know where to find me.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> Would you?
This here is my showplace.<eos> It pretty much speaks for itself.<eos> When I grew up, nine of us lived in a shack no bigger than this room.<eos> And look what I have today.<eos> I only wish Mrs. McDowell could have lived to see it.<eos> - You have a fine house, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> In 20 or 30 years, with hard work, maybe you could have a place like this.<eos> - That would be something.<eos> - Wouldn't it?
I remember the time I threw a clean slate at the Cleveland club. You beat Cy Young one to nothing.<eos> Hughie Jennings hit a homer in the ninth. - Huh?<eos> My grandfather took me.<eos> First big league game I ever went to.<eos> Kid Gleason beat the Indians with a no-hitter.<eos> No kiddin'?<eos> You're havin' a hell of a series, Buck.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothin'. Just keep it up is all.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
- Well, Bob, I pick up the decorations at 2--<eos> - Done with the voice.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Food arrives at 5. Belly dancer arrives at 5:30.<eos> Belly dancer leaves at 6. Guests arrive at 6:30.<eos> Limo drops Danny here at home at 7.<eos> - What about his present?<eos> - I'm leaving work early I'm gonna take Bullet, get him fitted for seat covers. He is gonna love them.<eos> - Boy, he really loves this car.<eos> - Hey, who wouldn't?
Nai village?<eos> I wasn't informed. Are you sure?<eos> It was last minute.<eos> Oh man, that really stinks.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No sir, don't let me stop you.<eos> Smell bad? I told you it was her.<eos> That ain't no kinda woman<eos> I mean it sure looks like a woman, but it smells like some sort of rotten thing. You'd have to be pretty damn desperate. I wouldn't go near that!<eos> I would.
They're here to keep the guests happy.<eos> They shouldn't show off with each other.<eos> That's not gonna sell lessons.<eos> - Hi, kids.<eos> Having fun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Actually, I've gotta excuse myself.<eos> I'm in charge of the games tonight.<eos> Would you like to help me get things started?<eos> Sure she would.
Far away. To America.<eos> We could go to America and get a house and a wife.<eos> We could save up our money, Dad.<eos> Yes, we have to get away from here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Stealing eggs.<eos> I was so hungry.<eos> I know who the father is.<eos> Promise me that you won't tell anyone.<eos> His father would...
"sugar shocks" aren't good for you.<eos> how 'bout if i pour healthy milk on them?<eos> how about if i pour milk on your oatmeal?<eos> chocolate milk? it's a deal!<eos> where's alf this morning?<eos> probably too ashamed to come to breakfast.<eos> or too full!<eos> i dreamed alf came into my room and tried to eat me.<eos> alf would never do that.<eos> of course he wouldn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't look so surprised.<eos> You've been gnashing your teeth ever since I got here.<eos> I just didn't wanna make a liar out of you.<eos> - Would you mind telling us why?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I would.
Maybe a little too nice.<eos> No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing available until after 7.15.<eos> Yeah, that's OK.<eos> - Goodnight, Rose.<eos> - The young woman said you'd get this.<eos> - She didn't pay for this?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Lulu?<eos> She said the gentleman would pay for dinner.<eos> The gentleman would...
Hideo Takamini?<eos> Well, actually it's pronounced Kevin Donaldson.<eos> I don't have a Donaldson.<eos> Well, you have one now.<eos> I'm Kathryn Fairly, and it's an honor to meet you.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Okay, I have twwo positions left... Pilot and Shuttle Commander.<eos> Kevin, tell me why you'd like to be Shuttle Commander.<eos> I wouldn't, no.
Is the afternoon train due soon?<eos> Well, been and gone a half an hour ago.<eos> There was a passenger dropped off for you. She's waiting for you on the platform.<eos> She?<eos> Not to worry, Matthew. I don't think she bites.<eos> Well, it's a boy I've come for.<eos> Oh, she won't have any trouble explaining. She has a tongue of her own.<eos> I suppose you're Mr. Matthew Cuthbert. My name is Anne Shirley. Anne is spelled with an "e."<eos> I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me today,... so I made up my mind to climb up that big, wild cherry tree and wait for you till morning. It would be lovely to sleep in a cherry tree all silvery in the moonshine, don't you think?<eos> Oh, yes it would.
I intend on taking my teacher's license in one year instead of two, at Miss Stacey's suggestion.<eos> Gee, I was imagining you would have a career on the stage.<eos> Well, I think you'd make a swell actress, especially as the Lily Maid.<eos> I hear you're giving "The Highwayman" at the White Sands recital.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Well, I have a little confession to make.<eos> I was just at the Lawson's myself and Alice told me you were walking home. Oh.<eos> I'm going to try to get you an encore while you're up there so make sure you have a second selection ready.<eos> Nobody is gonna encore me.<eos> Well, I would.
That's J.B. Fletcher.<eos> Oh, didn't recognize him.<eos> Her.<eos> Her, Kent.<eos> She writes wonderful whodunits.<eos> [Exhales] Really.<eos> Driver says we'll be there with time to spare. Mm-hmm.<eos> Anyway, the drawing isn't until the end of the evening.<eos> That way they make sure that no one walks out on them too early.<eos> Oh, not that they would, Ms. Fletcher.
I want you to know how sorry I am that... our friendship has to end this way.<eos> How very thoughtful of you.<eos> It's so unjust what's happening.<eos> I know you both loved Charles very much.<eos> Was there anything else, Marta?<eos> No.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.<eos> We will, dear.<eos> Diana, you wouldn't.
The general is raving mad!<eos> He says he's going to make them pay for it.<eos> We might lose everything!<eos> We might lose Gaby!<eos> You'll lose Gaby!<eos> You!<eos> And if it's true?<eos> If the parents were what you said.<eos> Would it change anything?<eos> Would it?
It is by accepting that I would take responsibility for our lives, and that would be, damn it, immodest.<eos> It's easy enough.<eos> You stupid, get out of here.<eos> Why?<eos> You disturb my sleep, you stupid.<eos> But I'm keeping quiet.<eos> Yes, but as you are standing here and I hear them howling,<eos> I feel as if you were screaming in my ear.<eos> Would the loudspeakers not disturb you, if I were not here?<eos> They wouldn't.
But he was so unhappy underneath it all.<eos> Because of them, those selfish relatives.<eos> All they ever wanted from him was his money.<eos> And now they'll get it.<eos> I wouldn't put it past any of them.<eos> Abby, I know how you felt about him.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I... admired him very much.<eos> Would you like me to stay here with you a little longer?<eos> Would you, Jess?
She's impossible.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> - Who lives here?<eos> - Dany.<eos> When she's in Paris.<eos> It was all fixed, then she said no.<eos> - Bringing me here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - She'd prefer we weren't here?<eos> - Of course she would.
Wait for the tournament.<eos> It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.<eos> You did all that damage?<eos> When you make a wish in the shower, it always comes true.<eos> - I should have kept my mouth shut.<eos> - No, we've got an agreement.<eos> What's that? They agreed not to beat up on me and I promised not to bleed on them.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - What can I do, moan and groan?<eos> - Anybody else would.
- Thanks. You've already paid.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Thanks very much.<eos> This potato's frozen solid.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Is your rabbit for sale?<eos> - I'm selling him cheap, too.<eos> - It might cost you dear.<eos> - What d'you mean? Take it!<eos> - I wouldn't.
No!<eos> You're pregnant? Carla.<eos> Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> I've got a lot on my mind. I can't remember everything.<eos> Sure. Busy girl.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Unless you don't want another kid.<eos> - Of course she wanted the kid.<eos> - Sure I do.<eos> What penniless, unmarried mother of four wouldn't?
Hey, listen, everybody.<eos> This is my big brother!<eos> Idiot!<eos> You boys, did you mean it... when you said you'd take any kind of job?<eos> Yep.<eos> You've got something?<eos> Yes, I believe I have... if you boys would like to make 10 yen a day.<eos> Ten yen?<eos> You bet, mister!<eos> Ten yen? Yeah, of course we would.
- Jesus, your son is in the next room!<eos> - I would never have done it if I'd known who you were.<eos> Look... I... I need to explain.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't. - Please.<eos> Jesus, I don't know what you want from me.<eos> If you want understanding, OK.<eos> I understand.<eos> Would you please hold me?<eos> Would you?
Kill your partners and give us Channel 83.<eos> Hello, Max.<eos> How ya doin', Max?<eos> Where's Moses?<eos> He's in a meeting with Rafe.<eos> I'll tell him you want him.<eos> Don't.<eos> We dub in a funny track. Gentle comedy.<eos> Mm-hmm. And you'd be the one to write it?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I would.
Who wouldn't want someone who fusses and flatters<eos> Who makes you feel that you're all that matters<eos> Whose only aim in life is to serve you<eos> And make you think she doesn't deserve you?<eos> No wonder he loves her<eos> It's all right.<eos> It happens. All the time.<eos> What else could he do?<eos> If I were a man<eos> I would, too
That night in Chicago in 1 973, with those two young dollars I borrowed? Yeah.<eos> Two young dollars?<eos> Yeah, I hate it when they're wrinkled.<eos> I'm out of practice.<eos> It's years since I did an interview.<eos> Come on, Sam. It's good advertising.<eos> It would help business.<eos> Right. And we can all be on TV.<eos> I'd like to see myself on TV.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Meaning that either there is no ringer, or if there is one, his nerves are a lot better than we thought.<eos> Or you're not as obvious as you might be.<eos> Though I find that very hard to believe.<eos> Bonnie, did he actually give me a compliment?<eos> Listen, do any of the drivers know exactly what the mission is yet? No, of course not.<eos> Why should they be briefed before it's absolutely necessary?<eos> That's true.<eos> But if there is a bad guy... he would have to know, wouldn't he?<eos> What a brilliant thought.<eos> Yes, of course he would.
Pursuit force minus one tank.<eos> Close ranks.<eos> On the other side of the screen, it all looked so easy.<eos> They must've gone right past us.<eos> We made it... this far.<eos> Pursuit force reporting. We lost visual contact.<eos> Get the pursuit forces back into the canyons.<eos> Those programs never made it out.<eos> We'll have them back before the Interrupt Interface.<eos> We'd better, null unit.
What's his problem?<eos> He thinks I'm a liberal.<eos> Get back here, you motherfucker!<eos> My recollection don't recall it.<eos> I don't remember. What do you want?<eos> Captain Dugan's office.<eos> Don't you monitor the people who ask to see the commander?<eos> What if I was a lunatic with a gun?<eos> Then you wouldn't be a police officer, Captain Connolly.<eos> Or would you?
Politicians, you know.<eos> In a little town when you talk to somebody... and you tell them about the lights on the road, they're not blinking. They don't want to take no responsibility.<eos> I says, "Who do you call?<eos> DOT?"<eos> They didn't know, see.<eos> They don't care.<eos> They should run them out of town, on a rail, tar and feathers.<eos> Yeah, Ilike that.<eos> That tar and feathers.<eos> Boy, wouldn't youlike that?
For Maria Luigia.<eos> The sow.<eos> You've little money left.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> That's not the problem.<eos> I want to know why we're helping Spaggiari steal a billion.<eos> Because the boss has a plan which I approve.<eos> And I have a secret plan the boss doesn't know.<eos> Can't I know?<eos> I'd rather not.
Monica called. If I don't come, she gets angry.<eos> Go then, get your mind off things.<eos> - We could have gone together.<eos> There's a Rembrandt exhibition.<eos> Go then.<eos> See you on Monday.<eos> Can I call you tomorrow?<eos> - Why?<eos> It would do me good.<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Ilio is really sweet<eos> Give a hand<eos> I was sure I saw somebody I know<eos> Give me a hand with this trunk.<eos> How could you know anybody in here?<eos> You keep seeing people everywhere<eos> You should better stop hitting the bottle<eos> Nice, huh Ernesto?<eos> Let it out, that's it...<eos> Would in the slack
